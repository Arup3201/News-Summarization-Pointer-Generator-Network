Britain's biggest broadband suppliers are failing to deliver by providing speeds half as fast as advertised, a study revealed today.

Providers like Sky, Orange, BT and PlusNet all delivered actual broadband speeds which were half as fast as their advertised packages.

An Ofcom study found that Sky, who advertise 20mb broadband, had an average actual speed as low as 6.3mb, while PlusNet's 8mb package in reality delivered speeds as low as 3.7mb.

Slow coach: Broadband packages from Sky, BT, PlsuNet and Orange are falling well short of their advertised speeds, according to Ofcom

However, firms like Virgin who offered super-fast broadband of up to 30mb were hitting their promised targets.

Virgin's 50mb meanwhile offered an impressive average of 48.8mb.

The Ofcom study also found a huge difference in performance between BT's faster and slower broadband packages.

Its new £18 a month Infinity service promising speeds of up to 40mb averaged 36mb, whereas households on its 20mb deal for £14 a month had to endure a sluggish 8mb.

Those on Karoo's 24mb broadband averaged download speeds of 7.4mb - less than a third of the speed advertised.

Ofcom chief executive, Ed Richards said: 'There is a real opportunity for consumers to look at the packages and deals in their area in order to receive the best value, speeds and performance available to them.'

A spokesperson for BT said the difference in speeds was due to the speed difference between fibre optic and copper cables.

The spokesperson said: 'There are other factors involved like the distance of the house from the exchange and even the wiring in the home.

'We make it clear to customers what speed they can expect depending on where they live before they sign up.

'No customer should be in any doubt as to the likely speed that they should expect from our service.

'We provide comprehensive broadband services at great value where speed is important.'

Ofcom found the average speed across Britain was 7.6Mb in November compared with 6.2Mb in 2010.

New guidelines will be introduced in April meaning suppliers will have to be more accurate with the speeds they advertise.
