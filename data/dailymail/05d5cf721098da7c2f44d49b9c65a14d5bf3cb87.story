Mark Selby lifted his first major trophy since the World Championship in May as he beat Shaun Murphy in a gripping German Masters final.

The Leicester potter, who takes the world No 1 ranking on the back of his 9-7 triumph over Murphy, emerged brilliantly from a recent slump to take the glory in Berlin.

He fell early in both December's UK Championship and January's Masters at Alexandra Palace, but Selby was back to his best to fend off close friend Murphy.

Selby overcam Shaun Murphy in the final to record a 9-7 victory and take the world No 1 ranking

He trailed 5-2 early on but took the final frame of the afternoon session to close the gap, and reeled off four in a row at the start of the evening to transform the contest.

Murphy had ploughed in breaks of 130 and 118 in an afternoon purple patch, but the sharp potting that saw him carry off the Masters in London last month was then absent at key moments.

And Selby, who had breaks of 92 and 93 during his early-evening flurry of frames, took advantage to carry off the title and prize money of £60,000.

Selby was competing in pool in China last week, finishing runner-up in the eight-ball World Championship.

He said of his latest snooker success: 'I'm really proud of myself. To get out of the (afternoon) session at 5-3 I knew I was still in the match. At 6-2 I possibly couldn't have won.

'But I played well tonight, to start off the session.

Selby has also returned to the top of the world rankings as a result of his victory in Germany

'Winning the World Championship last year did put a lot of weight on my shoulders. Going into every tournament I have felt a lot more pressure. But coming here, it's fantastic to get a win under my belt this season. It's nice to get one out of the way.

'Being back to number one is a good feeling.'

Murphy said on British Eurosport: 'Losing the first four frames tonight wasn't in my script but the guy is world champion and he's a credit to our sport. We're lucky to have him.'
