After a slack defensive performance in game one of the Eastern Conference finals, NBA analysts Reggie Miller and Greg Anthony are expecting the Miami Heat to enter game two against the Indiana Pacers with a renewed focus.

The Pacers beat the Heat 107-96 on Sunday night, with two-time defending champions Miami suffering a number of defensive breakdowns that allowed the Pacers to score their highest total of this year's post-season.

Paul George led Indiana with 24 points, while five other players scored in double figures. LeBron James scored 25 points for the Heat and Dwyane Wade 27, but the rest of their squad struggled to get going offensively and defensively.

'We're all waiting for the Heat to go into that extra gear,' said Miller, an 18-year NBA veteran who is now in the Hall of Fame and an analyst for TNT.

'A season ago they had a stretch where they won 20 plus games in a row, but we haven't seen that extra gear yet. It's not a light switch, you can't turn it on and off, but at the end of the day they have LeBron James on their team.

'When their backs are against the wall, like they were in the Brooklyn series, he went for 49 points - I would not be surprised if he came out tonight with one of those types of performances.' 

Anthony, another former player turned 
NBA analyst, said this version of the Miami Heat are not as good as the 
teams that won the Larry O'Brien trophy in 2013 and 2012.

'That supporting cast is not nearly as supportive,' said Anthony, who played for six teams in a 10-year career.

'The things that they've thrived on in the past - their ability to make threes and their defence - they're not as good at it. Indiana played great offense to win game one, but they're not a great offensive team.  

'They were able to exploit a lot of weaknesses of Miami's defence and also Miami offensively, that suporting cast is not where it's been in the past. Chris Bosh is going to have to play better, he was neturalised in game one and Wade and James are going to have to play at an even higher level for this team to have a chance.'

Game two tips off on Wednesday at 1.30am
 and the Indiana Pacers know a second win at their home arena will put 
them in pole position by the time the series moves back to Miami on 
Saturday.

Anthony believes that game two is bigger for Indiana than it is for Miami.

'If Miami comes out and wins tonight then the entire conversation of the series is going to change,' he said. 'In a lot of ways this is a bigger game for Indiana to win than it is for Miami, because this is a game where the Pacers can take full control of the series.  

'Miami are going to win a game in Indianapolis before the series is over, the question is will they have to win two in order to advance to the finals.' 

Miller, who played his whole career for the Pacers, agrees that a win tonight will be huge for the Pacers, but expects Erik Spoelsta's Miami Heat team to be much better.

He said: 'Erik Spoelstra's team were out of character. I think we're going to get a better effort defensively, they've got to be better. But I think we're all waiting for the Heat to go to that different gear, we've not seen it all year.

Ray Allen - Supporting cast: Ray Allen and Miami's other reserves must make more of an impact game two

'I want to see that gear from the Heat. If they win tonight then the emphasis of this series changes becuase all they want to do is win one, then they go home and try to maintain and hold on and win their two games.  

'Tonight will show me a lot. A young hungry team in Indiana who have been screaming "we want Miami" all year have a chance to put them in a 2-0 hole.

'There are not a lot of teams who have done that to this team with the big three, who are two-time defending champs with the best player on the planet.'
