Convicted killer Jodi Arias tearfully pleaded with jurors to spare her from a death sentence on Tuesday during a bizarre 25-minute testimony in which she pledged, if allowed to live, to donate her hair to cancer patients and start a prison recycling program.

'I have made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to life in prison,' Arias told jurors. In each of those cases, 'I lacked perspective,' she said.

'Until very recently I could not imagine standing before you all and asking for you to give me life,' she said. 'But as I stand here now I cannot in good conscience ask you to sentence me to death.'

Arias made the statements as she tried desperately to humanize herself to jurors by sharing childhood photographs, talking about her 'red-headed stage' and displaying the drawings she has created while in prison.

Arias, 32, was found guilty earlier this
month in the premeditated murder of Travis Alexander, whose body was 
found slumped in the shower of his Phoenix-area home in June 2008. He 
had been stabbed multiple times, had his throat slashed and been shot in
the face.

'This is the worst mistake of my 
life,' Arias said. 'It's the worst thing I have ever done...Before that 
day I wouldn't even want to harm a spider.'

Listing ways that she could contribute positively from prison, Arias promised to teach women how to speak Spanish and to help improve literacy among inmates, as well as start a book club.

Arias also noted that she has avoided looking at Alexander's family during the trial.

'It's never been my intention to throw mud on Travis's name,' she said. 'I loved Travis and I looked up to him. At one point, he was the world to me.'

She choked up as she spoke about the impact of her crime on her own family, saying they would be destroyed if she was sentenced to death.

'I want everyone's healing to begin and everyone's pain to stop,' she said. She also grew emotional while talking about her the fact that she will never be able to have children as a result of her actions.

'I'm not going to have children of my 
own,' she said. 'I'm not going to become a mother. Because of my own 
terrible choices, I've had to lay that dream to rest.'

In closing statements later Tuesday, Defense attorney Jennifer Willmott asked the jury to consider that 'people are far better than their very worst deed.'

She claimed that Jodi's personality disorder and alleged emotional abuse that she observed between her mother and father 'is in no way an excuse for killing [Travis Alexander],' but they could have contributed to her crime and should therefore be considered when weighing the death penalty.

'While what she did was absolutely horrible, you have convicted her of that,' Willmott said. 'Two wrongs do not make a right.'

'Jodi can still contribute to this world. Her life still has value,' she continued. 'We are asking you to find that Jodi's life is worth saving.'

Prosecutor Juan Martinez followed up Willmott by showing jurors a photograph of Alexander's bloodied body from the scene of the murder.

Artist: Arias shared some of her drawings that she has done while in prison. Illustrated on the left is Elizabeth Taylor. On the right is Elvis Presley.

Pleading: 'Until very recently I could not imagine standing before you all and asking for you to give me life,' she said. 'But as I stand here now I cannot in good conscience ask you to sentence me to death'

The image caused a physical reaction 
among members of Alexander's family who were present, with several 
turning their heads, shielding their eyes and letting out sobs.

'Travis Alexander was 30 years old [when he was murdered],' Martinez said. 'He's still today 30 years old, because of her.'

Maricopa County Superior Court Judge 
Sherry Stephens had on Monday denied requests by the defense for a mistrial 
and to withdraw from the case. She also denied a motion for a stay to 
give the defense time to appeal her decisions to the Arizona Supreme 
Court. The defense said it would not call any more witnesses.

The jury that convicted Arias of 
murder found last week she had acted with extreme cruelty and ruled her 
eligible for the death penalty.

The
murder trial has featured graphic testimony and photographs as well as a
sex tape and became a sensation on cable television news with the tale 
of an attractive, young woman charged with an unthinkable crime.

Arias
has said she shot Alexander with his own pistol when he attacked her in
a rage because she dropped his camera while taking snapshots of him in 
the shower. She said she did not remember stabbing him.

Martinez said Arias had repeatedly stabbed Alexander for two minutes as he tried to escape from the bathroom. She then followed the bleeding victim down a hallway and slashed his throat when he was too weak to get away.

Alexander, a 30-year-old businessman and motivational speaker with whom Arias said she was having an on-again, off-again affair, knew he was going to die and was unable to resist his attacker at that point, Martinez said.
