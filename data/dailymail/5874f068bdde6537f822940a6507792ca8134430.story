The economic crises in Italy appears to have hit the Mafia because there are fewer businesses to extort.

The revelation comes after  jailed Cosa Nostra boss Giovanni Di Giacomo was secretly recorded complaining about the collapse of protection and extortion rackets.

He said that his men were only able to get around €5,000 to €7,000 a month from hotels and businesses, because so many are closing down.

Now, he said, the situation was so dire that it might be better for younger Mafia members to give up a life of crime and get a 'real job' instead.

Di Giacomo was observed in a year-long investigation led by Palermo prosecutors Francesca Mazzocco and Caterina Malagoli, while he was in prison in Parma, northern Italy.

He wrote to jailed colleagues of his concerns over the organisation's finances and the economy, the Independent reports.

He was overheard telling an associate: 'Hotels are closing, changing management,
 there’s no longer the work, the building sites.'

It comes after last year's reports that the Cosa Nostra had ordered its own review of spending - and cuts were hitting younger mob members,and families of those jailed.

However, the main bosses seemed to have been spared the axe on handouts.

It had been predicted at the start of Italy's recession that organised crime could flourish with businesses forced to take handouts from the criminal underworld.

But it seems that it is the mob themselves who are struggling, as extortion rackets relying on business are collapsing in the long winded economic downturn.
