Ronda Rousey is probably the most successful sportswoman you've never heard of.

You won’t find her name on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes, nor will you read about her in the sports pages of any newspaper.

But take a look at the facts.

Since 2011, Rousey has won each of her 10 mixed martial arts fights, all but one of them in the first round. At No 7, and as the bantamweight champion, she is the only woman in the UFC’s pound-for-pound top 15 list.

She also won judo bronze at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

Away from the Octagon, Rousey starred in The Expendables 3 and has parts in Furious 7 and Entourage later this year.

She was also one of just two athletes in this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, alongside Caroline Wozniacki, and her autobiography will be out in May.

Naturally, her busy schedule leads to questions about whether she has too much on her plate.

‘You know, when I try and set out to do things that people say are impossible first they ask me why I do it,’ Rousey says. ‘Then after I accomplish it they ask me how I did it. And the reason why you doubt the ability that it could ever be done is the reason why you will never do anything that great.’

And when asked how this year will compare to the previous 12 months, Rousey said: 'Well this is kind of a colourful way to say it but if 2014 was my bitch than 2015 is going to look like my bitch’s bitch.'

On Saturday night, Rousey will headline UFC184 when she takes on the unbeaten Cat Zingano in Los Angeles. For the first time in the promotion’s history, the co-main event is also an all-female affair, featuring Raquel Pennington against Holly Holm. 

‘I just walk out and I solve the fight as it happens,’ Rousey adds. ‘So I know that Cat brings so many weapons to the table that I will be ready to deal with every single one of them.

‘And that's what makes it such an exciting fight; there isn't one clear quick cut way to go to finish it. ‘And so I really think that's what makes it exciting, you don't know where it's going to go but I can finish her anywhere and I will find a way.

‘I think that Cat's resilience is one of the things that has really impressed me about her the most. And I think that's what's really gotten her most of her fans. It’s not just the way that she fights but the way that she endures. And it's extremely impressive and one of those things that I will definitely keep in mind for the fight.

‘She's not one of those people that can be intimidated so I won't even bother. She's not one of those people that can start losing a fight and you can count on them being a front runner and just beating themselves. She's one of those people that has to be finished all the way until the very, very end and I'm ready for that.

Rousey starred in The Expendables 3 alongside Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes

‘I'm ready for a five-round war if it needs to be that way. I'm still going to be the better fighter that night regardless of what happens.’

Zingano had been due to face Rousey in 2013 but suffered a knee injury which ruled her out for 18 months, returning last September with a third-round win against Amanda Nunes.

And she insists has no fear ahead of her title challenge.

‘Well I'm different. I know she knows that, I know the whole promotion knows that,’ she says. ‘I have things to offer that people haven't seen before and it's just I just have to be me, I have do me, go out there with my intensity and my aggression and I'm unstoppable, I know that.

‘You know I'm going out there and I'm at the top, there's nowhere higher to go and I'm just pumped to be here. And being the underdog, man I like that, I do.

‘I think that it gives me a lot that I want to prove and a lot I want to show and it forces me to be authentic and to pull out my best stuff. So I think it's fun.’

Rousey stopped Alexis Davis in the first round of her last fight in Las Vegas last July
