A Preston club night once probably only known to people in Lancashire has been catapulted to international fame after its promotional video was branded the worst ever made.

The film showing clubbers of all ages dancing wildly at the Bounce By The Ounce event at Rumes Bar has now been viewed by more than 1.3million people online.

It starts with the promoter telling viewers: 'Respect going out. Bounce by the Ounce crew. Yes, you know the styles, check the vibe', followed by a series of extracts from its event on May 31.

But the star is a gurning clubber dubbed 'Crazy Guy' on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, who has been revealed as a 41-year-old plasterer from Leyland.
