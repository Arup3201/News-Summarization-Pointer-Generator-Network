The mother of the woman shot dead by Kansas City Chief linebacker Jovan Belcher in December has described the heartbreaking moment she learned her daughter had been killed.

Kasandra Perkins, 22, was shot dead by Belcher - her boyfriend and the father of her then three-month-old daughter - in their home before he drove to the Chief's stadium and took his own life.

Her mother, Becky Gonzalez, has now spoken out about the pain of losing her daughter and how she is trying her best to battle through her grief to raise her orphaned granddaughter.

Pain: Becky Gonzalez struggles to contain her emotions as she remembers her daughter, Kasandra Perkins, who was shot dead by her NFL boyfriend Jovan Belcher last December

'When I received the call, I could 
tell in the voice of the person that something was wrong,' Gonzalez told WFAA. 'I asked them are they about to tell 
me something bad? And they said, "yes".'

'I tried to prepare myself and think 
of the worst thing that could happen. The thing that came to my mind was
losing my child, and that's what she said. So my worst nightmare came 
true.'

She said that the family has been left 'devastated' by Kasandra's death. The young mother was shot nine times in the neck, chest, abdomen, hip, back, leg and hand.

'She was precious to us and a friend to everyone, and it's changed us forever,' Gonzelez, from Arlington, Texas, told WFAA. 'And now we have a little girl to raise.'

Battle: The couple had a turbulent relationship and were struggling to cope with their baby child

Gonzalez is raising baby Zoey after Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepard, granted temporary custody to Kasandra's parents days after the tragedy.

Shepard, who was at the home when the murder took place and called 911, is now locked in a custody battle with Gonzalez for baby Zoey, who has an estate of $3 million.

Gonzalez said her baby granddaughter lessons the pain of losing her child.

'I see my daughter in [Zoey's] eyes, 
and that brings me joy, and I know that she's continuing on through her 
daughter,' Gonzalez said.

Loss: Gonzalez said relatives were devastated by the death and were focusing on bringing up baby Zoey

She added that it was unfathomable to her how Belcher could have left his child without parents if he claimed to love her, but 'obviously he must 
have felt he didn't have another choice'.

Gonzalez is now hoping that her daughter's story will help reduce domestic violence, and she is supporting a rally against domestic abuse in Dallas this weekend.

'I don't want her death to be in vain,' 
Gonzalez said. 'She was too important. She needs to have stood for 
something, and in a way, it does feel like Iâ€™m honoring her this way.'

Perkins and Belcher had been arguing before he shot her on December 1, his mother told police.

Shepherd had moved 
in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. She heard Belcher say, 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a 
thump and gunshots.

Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police.

Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and 
repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said.

Belcher drove off in his Bentley to the practice facility at Arrowhead 
several miles away, where he pulled into the parking lot and saw General Manager Scott Pioli, 
the report said.

Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a
handgun to his own head. 'I got to go, can't be here, and take care of 
my daughter,' Pioli recalled Belcher saying.

He had asked to speak with coach Romeo Crennel and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the 
report said. Crennel told police he pleaded with Belcher to put down the
gun.

On the field: Belcher had played in the NFL for three years before the murder and suicide on December 1

Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, 
Crennel told police.

Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing
sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the 
gun into his temple, the report said.

It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a row about whether or not Belcher was Zoey's father.

It also emerged last month that the NFL 
player had a secret girlfriend - Brittni Glass - who he allegedly told 
he would shoot Perkins 'if she didn't leave him alone'.
