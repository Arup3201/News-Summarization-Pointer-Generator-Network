New York City will come to a standstill tomorrow as Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office said it will shut down the entire train and bus system at noon Saturday as Hurricane Irene moves up the east coast.

The shutdown will include the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and Access-A-Ride.

The last complete system shutdown in New York City was during a 2005 transit union strike.

In a press conference Friday, Bloomberg warned that service may not be restored in time for the Monday morning commute.

He said: 'There is no question that we're going to get hit with some wind and high water that is going to be dangerous.'

MTA chairman Jay Walder added : 'I cannot stress enough: please do not wait for the last train, and if you donâ€™t need to travel, please don't.'

New Jersey and Philadelphia transit systems followed suit Friday, announcing system shut-offs as well.

Like New York, New Jersey Transit and it's PATH service between New York and New Jersey will end at noon Saturday. Bus service will be suspended at 5 pm.

New Jersey Governor Christ Christie said: 'ACES and Meadowlands service has already been suspended beginning at noon tomorrow. All rail service will be suspended.'

In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter said mass transit in the city of brotherly love and its suburbs will halt at 12:30 a.m. Sunday.

As Irene swirls in the Atlantic, 
Americans have been warned to start preparing for travel chaos up and down the East Coast as airlines 
began to cancel flights and get planes out of the way in preparation for
 the storm's entrance onto the U.S. mainland.

New York officials said most major bridges, including the George Washington and Verrazano, will be closed to all traffic if wind speeds exceed 60 mph.

The storm has forced hundreds of flights to be cancelled over this weekend and while those in coastal areas will be immediately affected, delays could ripple across the country.

Adding to the transit woes were the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights, as Southwest and American Airlines joined JetBlue in grounding planes.

Most of the flights were cancelled from Saturday through Monday, mostly at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and in Boston, Bloomberg reported.

American Airlines and its American Eagle affiliate, with an extensive network in the Caribbean, cancelled 126 flights on Thursday.

Most were in the Bahamas and south Florida, including Miami, a jumping-off spot for flights to the Caribbean and Latin America.

Delta Air Lines reported four cancellations yesterday, and United just one.

Airlines have already begun allowing travellers
 to change flights without paying the usual financial penalties.

Even before Irene's arrival, unrelated thunderstorms were causing delays of up to two hours today at major airports in the New York and Washington areas, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.

The service's CEO, Daniel Baker, predicted that Irene-related cancellations would pick up this afternoon and become significant on Saturday.

Irene presents serious challenge. Because major travel hubs such as Washington and New York are in its potential path, flights that are cancelled or delayed there tend to ripple across the country.

'Most everyone expects New York to get hit, so you're obviously not going to leave a lot of planes on the ground in New York, waiting for a problem,' said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines.

He said all the airline's flights on Thursday in the Bahamian capital of Nassau were cancelled and there were delays in Miami due to heavy rain. He said the airline would track forecasts before making decisions about cancellations for today.

Spanish tourist Noelia Chacon is travelling the East Coast with her husband and son. The family's vacation has been badly affected by the weather.

They were evacuated from the Smithsonian in Washington after Tuesday's earthquake and now might limit their New York sightseeing due to Irene.

'We've had an earthquake and a hurricane so far. We'll see what's next,' Ms Chacon said, as rain fogged the windows of the hotel lobby. 'This is a trip we will not soon forget.'
