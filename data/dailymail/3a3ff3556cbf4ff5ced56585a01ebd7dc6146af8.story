A tiny dog almost caused a big Tour de France crash Sunday.

As the peloton neared speeds of 50 miles per hour in the second stage, the white dog got away from his owner and into the middle of the course, NBC reported.

The 96-mile run through Corsica was almost at its end when the dog ran between the race's leaders and the chasing pack, according to Metro.Â

Curious pooch: Just as the leading cyclists neared the finish in the second stage of the Tour de France, a tiny white dog got free from his owner

Gap: The dog went into the middle of the course in between the leading riders and the chasing pack

The dog remained on the road for a few seconds before, seemingly satisfied, he started to return to the sidelines.

But when its owner rushed to get him, the petite pooch jumped back, startled.

Abandon: To avoid getting hit himself, the canine's owner retreated when a group of 100 riders approached

But that's when a huge group of cyclists came round the bend.

The quick-thinking canine escaped the wrath of some 100 bikes and got out of the way, narrowly escaping another disastrous crash for the Tour.

In the first stage Saturday, a team bus broke down at the finish line, causing a huge crash at the closing stage of the race.

Narrow escape: The dog was almost hit by the cyclists, who were approached speeds of 50 mph

Safe: The dog ducked away in time, and the trailing pack moved on to the finish

The Orica Green Edge team coach, was trying to move away from the finish area roughly five minutes before the first cyclists were expected to cross. No one was seriously injured, but the finish line had to be moved.

In the 2007 Tour de France, a similar incident occurred with a worse result, when cyclist Marcus Burghardt collided with a dog.
