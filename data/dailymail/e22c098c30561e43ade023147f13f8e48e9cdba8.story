A boy has astonished doctors by going from being in a coma to starting secondary school in just 11 weeks.

Cyclist Harry Davies, 11, suffered the worst brain injuries local medics had ever seen when he was involved in a crash with a van near his home in East Lothian.

Harry suffered a six-inch skull fracture and was put in a coma in an attempt to save his life following the June 3 accident.

Harry Davies, 11, suffered the worst brain injuries medics had ever seen when he was involved in a crash with a van near his home in East Lothian. Harry not only survived but recovered quickly enough to start secondary school on time

But Harry has not only survived but recovered enough to start his high school at Knox Academy, in Haddington.

He is also now looking forward to resuming his favourite sporting activity - high diving.

His father, Nick, 46, said: 'He's doing remarkably well. We're just happy to get him home.He wants to play football but he can't do that in case he bumps his head.

'He finds that difficult but that will change. He had just got into diving lessons at the Commonwealth Pool [in Edinburgh].'

The crash caused Harry to land in the road head-first, suffering a fracture to his skull and cheekbone. On closer inspection doctors discovered he had suffered a six-inch skull fracture and was put in a coma in a bid to save his life

Doctors had to install a bolt into Harry's head to reduce swelling and put him into a coma because his injuries were so severe. But less than two weeks later Harry was sitting up (pictured) at Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children and smiling

Harry had been walking home from school with his best friend Douglas Simpson, 12.

After the collision, Douglas was thrown into a nearby verge, but escaped with only minor injuries as he landed on bushes.

Harry landed in the road head-first, suffering a fracture to his skull and cheekbone, and was rushed to hospital.

Doctors placed a bolt inside his head to reduce the swelling and put him into a coma because his injuries were so severe.

But less than two weeks later, Harry astonished doctors by sitting up at Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children and smiling.

Harry's father, Nick (pictured), 46, said: 'He's doing remarkably well. We're just happy to get him home.He wants to play football but he can't do that in case he bumps his head'

His mother Lisa, 46, said at the time: 'The neurologist said he had not seen this level of trauma in the brain of a child before. He's been quite lucky and he's a fighter.'

Earlier this month his mother Lisa, 46, threw an 'H in the Park' homecoming party for him, with around 100 of his friends turning up to a nearby park.

And on Wednesday this week he had his first day at local highschool Knox Academy.

Police said a 23-year-old man had been charged with careless driving in relation to the June accident.
