Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is due in court the day after Louis van Gaal's side face Newcastle in the Premier League, according to reports in Spain.  

Herrera is one of 41 people that have been called to court over the next four months after being implicated in a match fixing case involving Levante and Zaragoza from 2011.

Zaragoza won the match 2-1, meaning they avoided relegation but Spain's anti-corruption police investigated the fixture after they suspected wrong-doing.

Prosecutors allege that Levante players were paid to lose the match - a claim they deny. 

And now Spanish newspaper AS report that Herrera, who was involved in the match, is due in court on March 5 at 9.30am - the morning after Manchester United travel to St James' Park for their Premier League meeting. 

Among those also called is Aguirre who was manager of Levante when the match in question took place.

Japan coach Aguirre was fired on Tuesday over concerns that allegations of his involvement in match-fixing will interfere with qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.

Aguirre agreed it was unavoidable, Japan Football Association president Kuniya Daini said at a news conference. Both Aguirre and Herrera deny any wrongdoing.

Herrera left home-town club Zaragoza to join Athletic Bilbao in August 2011 and moved to United last summer

Zaragoza's former coach Javier Aguirre, now in charge of Japan, is also caught up in the allegations
