A judge has ordered divorced parents to pay more than $16,000 toward their 21-year-old daughter's college tuition - even though she hasn't spoken to them for two years.

Caitlyn Ricci from Cherry Hills, New Jersey, sued her estranged biological parents Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci for her fees at Temple University in Philadelphia and won.

The decision handed down by a Camden County judge meant they had a deadline of midnight on Thursday to complete the payment. 

However the pair insists they are not handing over any money and are planning to appeal.

Ruling: Caitlyn Ricci sued her estranged biological parents Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci for the fees at Temple University in Philadelphia and won

Ricci, described as a 'rebellious teen', left her family two years ago after she was allegedly thrown out by her mother. 

She then moved in with her grandparents who are now paying for the lawyer who is suing their own son Michael - Caitlyn's father.

For two years Maura tried to reach out to Caitlyn - sending her letters and writing her poems - but she never heard back.  

They eventually tried to file for an emancipation but the day before Mothers' Day last year, papers from Caitlyn's attorneys arrived at their home. 

Her parents claim she also purchased a car when she left the family home and subsequently demanded the money through her lawyers.  

Maura and Michael believe their daughter is just trying to get money out of them, however her grandparents insist they should pay up.  

Angela Ricci, Caitlyn's maternal grandmother, told 6 ABC's Action News: 'They just don't want to pay because they have to pay by the middle of the week. The balance they owe. This has been going on for two years.

Her grandfather, who told the station he would not divulge the reasons behind the fractious relationship, has said that if they don't pay up, he believes they should go to jail.  

Ricci's parents' marriage only lasted two-and-a-half years after they fell in love as youngsters. But they decided to come to an arrangement in a bid to give their daughter could the best life they could hope for.

Break down in relationship: Caitlyn was 'thrown out' of her house two years ago and moved in with her grandparents. They are helping to sue her parents, including their own son Michael, by paying for her attorney 

Parents: Maura and Michael, who dioverced after two-and-a-half years together, believe their daughter is just trying to get money out of them

But, following the breakdown in the relationship, her mother told the station: 'What child does this? It's insane.

'From the time Caitlyn was a teenager she was a challenging child, but I think all teenagers are.' 

'She comes from two loving families and she was given what she wanted when she was growing up,' her father Michael added. 

The judge in Camden County, New Jersey passed the decision citing the Newburgh precedent.

It states that all divorced parents are required to contribute to their child's education, whatever their age.  

Ricci turned to attorney Andrew Rochester to represent her in the lawsuit. He said: 'Caitlyn really is a good girl. She is the nicest, sweetest girl. All she wants is to go to college.

He added that the nicest thing the parents said about their daughter was that she was a 'spoiled brat'.

The student's Twitter account reads: 'I am changed and now im [sic] stronger.' 

Frustration: Maura (pictured with Caitlyn) has said 'what child does this?' and says her decisions are insane
