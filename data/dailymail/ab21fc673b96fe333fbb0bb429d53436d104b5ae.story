Playing up to the camera, these rats aren't shy in showing off their very human talents.

Whether it's doing sums on the abacus, knitting a woolly jumper for winter or having the family round for tea, they are the real life Sylvanian Families.

The cute pics are the work of Dutch photographer Ellen Van Deelen, who spent hours photographing her pet rats Poppy, Saffie Froppy and Rosie for a unique set of snaps.

In one, our furry friend is hopping into a VW Beetle, while another is out pushing a pram.

Out for a stroll: This rat poses with a pram

Van Deelen, 54, said: 'I never used to like rats, but one day I went to a pet shop and there was one left that no-one wanted to buy because it was a funny colour.

'I felt so sorry for it, I had to take it home. I then bought a friend for it and I've loved the rats ever since.

'They're such friendly and intelligent animals and so often misunderstood.'

She then combined her new pets with her passion for photography to get the perfect poses.

'It seemed only natural to take pictures of my rats. I started buying props for the rats and as they're inquisitive animals, it wasn't long before they started picking them up.

'I have a big imagination so often think of ideas for new photos. I use vanilla pudding on the props, on the handle of the knitting needle for example and that helps show the rats how to use the props.

Tender moment: A lovely kiss for this cuddly toy

'They're so clever, they soon know exactly what to do. It's fun to photograph them as they look really cute.

'My new favourite image is the one of both my rats eating birthday cake together - they really look like they're enjoying it.

'As long as I have my rats I will continue to take photos.'

Furry friends: This picture of two of the rats sharing afternoon tea was the photographer's clear favourite

Childhood favourite: The Sylvanian Families series of toys proved a big seller
