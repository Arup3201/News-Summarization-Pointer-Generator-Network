Actor Alan Davies has faced a backlash from Liverpool fans over comments he made on a football podcast

Comedian Alan Davies today apologised again for his remarks about the  Hillsborough disaster - but added that his attackers 'do not speak for the dead.'

Alan Davies came under fire for questioning Liverpool FC's refusal to play on the April 15 anniversary of the 1989 stadium disaster in which 96 football fans died.

The 46-year-old comedian apologised for the 'insensitivity' of the comments, but insisted today the reaction he received from Liverpool fans went too far.

Writing in The Times newspaper, Davies said he has been deemed worse than a serial rapist or paedophile by his critics, while others have sent him 'menacing warnings and threats to maim'.

He said: 'To comprehend the viciousness of the response, I've tried to understand the desire to mourn for so long, and so publicly, the death of those fans.

'The Justice For The 96 campaign is ongoing, but the reality of bereavement is not reflected in the staging of memorial services each year.

'The reality of bereavement is that the loss of a loved one is with you all year round.'

Critics had accused Davies of deliberately making the inflammatory comments to create 'free publicity' as he prepares to go on tour for the first time in 12 years.

Davies said sorry for the remarks, but last week aggravated the situation by joking on Twitter about disguising himself in a stereotypically 'Scouse' costume inspired by Harry Enfield.

After receiving a barrage of abuse and death threats on Twitter for the comments he made about Hillsborough on Tuesday, he wrote yesterday: ‘Going out later. I’ve decided to get a disguise.’

He then posted a link to a fancy dress costume of a ‘comedy Scouser’ including a 1980s shell suit, permed wig and bushy moustache.

Jonathan Creek and QI star Davies, an Arsenal supporter from Essex, went on to describe the abusive messages he has received as 'alarming'.

He added: 'There is a loss of perspective and a distortion of genuine emotion over Hillsborough.

'Those attacking me with such hatred don't speak on behalf of the dead and should be ashamed to claim that they do.

'At no point did I "mock the dead", as I am accused. What I have been subjected to is alarming. Vile and hateful messages by the hundred. Death threats to me, my wife and my children.

'Menacing warnings and threats to maim. I am worse than a serial rapist, than a paedophile. And some people are rejoicing that my mother is dead.

'It's difficult to contemplate anything I could say on any subject to generate a similar furore.'

Davies said that among the abuse he received after making the Hillsborough comments, he was contacted by people who said they 'want to urinate on my mother's grave', and 'who would take pleasure in seeing my wife sexually assaulted.'

Meanwhile at the annual memorial service at Anfield to mark the anniversary of Hillsborough, a guest speaker used the platform to hit out against the recent comments by Davies.

In a speech at the service, Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, addressed Davies' assertion that the club should be made to play on April 15.

She said: 'When certain people made certain comments about Liverpool Football Club should be playing on the 15th of April, I am afraid that person wants to learn to keep his comments to himself and his opinions to himself.

'Because when comments like that offend and hurt so many thousands of people it's quite obvious he has got nothing else to worry about in his life as what we have had for 23 years.'

Her criticism was greeted with loud cheers and applause. Following the furore that greeted the remarks on his weekly football podcast, Davies made a £1,000 donation to the campaign group - which it refused - and apologised for the tone.
