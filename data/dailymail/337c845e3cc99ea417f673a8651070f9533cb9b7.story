A woman sobbed in court on Friday as she was sentenced to 30 years in prison after being convicted on two counts of vehicular homicide for killing both a mother and her 3-year-old son.

Arica Vlach, 31, told the courtroom she 'was truly, truly sorry' and that she hoped that the family of Nicole Enderle, 42, and her 3-year-old son Alexander would forgive her for the July 12 crash that killed them both.

Enderle's 2-year-old daughter Zoe was in the car as well and survived the crash but suffered from injuries.

Victims: Nicole Enderle, 42, and her son Alexander, 3, died after drunk driver Arica Vlach hit their car on July 12

'If I could go back in time and change one single moment in my life, it would be to delete this tragedy,' she said as she weeped in front of 4th Judicial District Judge Timothy Schutz

The Gazette reports that Vlach was driving drunk on July 12 when she ran a stop sign at Judge Orr Road in eastern El Paso County.

Vlach was given consecutive sentences of 12 and 16 years for the deaths of Enderle and her son and an extra two years for the injury to her 2-year-old daughter

According to Lifetips.com, one person is killed every half-hour due to drunk driving and 16,000 people die from alcohol related crashes each year.

Alcohol is a factor in almost half of all traffic fatalities.
