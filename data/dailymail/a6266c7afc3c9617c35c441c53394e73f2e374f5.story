Police have arrested members of a gang suspected of selling counterfeit teeth whitening kits containing dangerous amounts of bleaching agent.

Officers who carried out raids in Merseyside found dozens of boxes of products with high levels of hydrogen peroxide – which can cause long-term health problems.

They held two men, aged 43 and 48, who are thought to be part of an international criminal network importing and selling a range of pirate luxury fashion goods for huge profits.

Police believe the suspects were planning to sell the phoney items online and at local market stalls.

Hydrogen peroxide levels have been subjected to cuts after concerns that some products were causing damage to teeth, lips and gums.

A 2012 European Union regulation says teeth-whiteners must contain no more than 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide or chemicals which release the substance.

Celebrity endorsements have raised the popularity of teeth whitening over recent years and it is now a multi-million pound business.

As a result, fraudsters have moved in on the business – selling pirated kits turned out in overseas factories using sub-standard and even dangerous ingredients. 

Detectives from the intellectual property crime unit, which was set up last September to tackle the huge quantities of counterfeit goods flooding into Britain, also seized fake designer goods in the raid.

Fake cosmetics, sunglasses, Ugg boots, handbags and Liverpool Football Club merchandise were also discovered

Among the hundreds of thousands of pounds of products found piled high in two shipping containers and another property were unbranded electronic cigarette refills, which could pose a significant health risk.

Fake cosmetics, sunglasses, Ugg boots, handbags and Liverpool Football Club merchandise were also discovered.
