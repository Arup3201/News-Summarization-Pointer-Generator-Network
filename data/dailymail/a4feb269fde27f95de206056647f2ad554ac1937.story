Oldham owner Simon Corney has reiterated his desire to sell the club in the wake of the Ched Evans saga.  

The League One club's chairman has previously said that should a buyer who can take Lee Johnson's side further forward than he can come along, he would happily listen to offers.

And following the collapse of the controversial move for the 26-year-old convicted rapist, Corney has repeated his willingness to sell the cash-strapped club.

Evans was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman and served half of a five-year sentence

Describing the events of the last two weeks, which saw Oldham catapulted into the public spotlight as 'an extraordinary period in our club's history,' Corney told the club's website that he took the blame for a 'loss of trust'.

However, he added that he was going nowhere for the time being.

'My commitment to the club, its fans, staff and sponsors is total and my desire to ensure that the new North Stand development is completed remains as strong as ever,' he said.

'We continue to face significant challenges but I am genuinely excited about the future prospects for our club and the plans we have put in place to ensure its long term future without the need for further investment.

Since his release, the former Sheffield United and Wales striker has found it difficult to find a new club

'Of course, as I have always said, if a buyer for the Club comes forward who is able to take things on to another level then I will consider selling. That buyer has to be the right person and have the best interests of the club at heart.

'It is now time to draw a line under the events of recent weeks and move on. We have a club to run and goals to achieve and the board, staff and I are determined to see this great club prosper.'

As revealed by MailSport, Oldham had agreed terms with former Sheffield United and Manchester City striker Evans, who has served half of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a North Wales hotel room.

The Welsh international striker, for whom the Blades paid Manchester City £3 million in 2009, was set to sign a two-and-a-half year deal.

But after the withdrawal of a series of sponsors which put the club's survival at risk, Corney decided, reluctantly, to pull the plug on the deal.

Threats were also made to club staff and more than 70,000 signed a petition against the move.

At Saturday's 2-2 draw with Doncaster Rovers, watched by a crowd of around 4,000, some Oldham supporters held a banner stating: '70,000 where are you?'

A small group sang 'There's Only One Ched Evans' and were confronted by a number of fellow fans, one of whom left the ground in disgust.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission has fast-tracked a review of Evans's case.
