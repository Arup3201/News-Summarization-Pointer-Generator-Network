Success: Kevin Lee, the inspiration behind Father Of The Bride's Franck, has offered budget bridal advice

Kevin Lee's lavish weddings allegedly inspired Franck, the flamboyant character played by Martin Short in 1991's Father Of The Bride.

But the Los Angeles-based events expert who also appears on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, claims that a beautiful, memorable wedding does not require a fortune to fund it.

The reality TV star said on Good Morning America this morning that there are plenty of options out there for brides who are planning their special day while on a budget.

Mr Lee, who was the brains behind 
the weddings of Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt as well as Bill and 
Giuliana Rancic, offered advice on everything from dining and 
entertainment to the invitations.

'Order invitations online,' he advised.

An endless stream of online options are said to provide much cheaper alternatives to those offered in store.

He also suggested that couples 
arrange for buffet stations to cater for their guests at the reception 
as they will 'save money compared to sit-down plater service which 
requires wait staff'.

A live musical act also tends to send costs soaring.

The expert, who claimed that his 
clients tend to easily spend $40,000 on flowers alone as they plan their
weddings, advised couples to hire a DJ.

If live music is an absolute must, 
arrange for the DJ to be accompanied by 'a couple of live instruments' 
rather than hunting down a full live band.

Mr Lee, who was also responsible for 
the wedding of Pandora, the daughter of Real Housewife Lisa Vanderpump, 
advised couples to focus their flower selection in one main area of the 
event.

He said that extravagant displays tend to pop and couples can fill the remaining space with candles to add romance.

As for the all-important gown itself,
Mr Lee advised brides to rent a high-end designer gown as opposed to 
buying one as women only wear their dresses once after all.

'I'm here to just [help] them to make them happy,' he said. 'That's what I want.'

He also ran through a list of the bridal industry's top trends.

Yellow is seemingly the It colour while retro furnishings with reflective surfaces and pops of bright colour are also proving popular.

In terms of table centrepieces, the more flowers the better according to Mr Lee.

Decor is also receiving plenty of attention as couples mix patterns and fabrics and play on vintage themes as a way to create atmosphere during their special days.
