Jeb Bush's uncertainty about a 2016 presidential run has some Republicans questioning whether he's prepared to take on the challenge

Republican Jeb Bush's
flirtation with a possible run for the White House in 2016 has
been so low key that some in his party aren't convinced he's
prepared to take on the challenge.

The former Florida governor with the famous family name is
among the leaders in polls charting potential Republican
contenders in 2016 and says he will decide late this year or
early next year.

But unlike some would-be competitors like New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie, who are making forward-leaning
statements, Bush is publicly expressing his uncertainty.

Questions are weighing heavily on Bush, 61, about the impact
on his wife and family and whether he can offer an agenda that
would unite Americans.

Whether he will run is a question that comes up almost daily
for Bush as he travels the country campaigning for Republican
candidates ahead of Nov. 4 congressional elections. On Thursday,
he was in Greenville, South Carolina, campaigning with Governor
Nikki Haley, who is seeking re-election.

'It's a big decision,' he told reporters in Greenville. 'It
relates to family.'

'I think the next presidential race has to be about the
future and it has to be about fixing some big problems,' he
said.

'I think it's more than likely that he's giving this a
serious thought and moving forward,' Bush's son, George P. 
Bush, said on ABC's 'This Week' program on Sunday. 'The family
will be behind him 100 percent if he decides to do it.'

He said that his father is 'still assessing' a presidential bid but it is 'more than likely that he'll run.' 

Bush's decision-making seems far less advanced than the
past Bush presidents were at similar points in their own career,
leading some Republicans to raise questions. His father, former
President George H.W. Bush, began preparing for a 1988 run in
1985. His brother, former President George W. Bush, was actively
planning his 2000 run at this point in 1998.

'There's a scent of activity that goes on in preparation for
a serious candidacy that involves a lot of contacts with donors
and strategists,' said Florida Republican strategist Rick
Wilson. 'People aren't seeing that from Jeb. I will say he's
been more active, been talking to folks, but not to a degree
that Chris Christie has been doing.'

George H.W. and George W: Unlike his father and brother, who eagerly planned their run for the White House, Jeb Bush is still undecided about whether he will run for president in 2016

Friends say Jeb Bush's cautiousness is due to his deliberate
manner and his experience watching his father and brother go
through what can be a meat-grinding process. They also say he is
not expecting to be drafted, recruited or convinced to run. That
is not his style.

'This is not a guy who spends sleepless nights staring at
the ceiling wondering if he should or should not run for
president,' said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and a
friend of Bush.

'He's a disciplined guy and will make this decision like he
does most other big decisions, through a serious deliberative
process weighing the pros and cons and looking deep into
himself. This is a decision that will be made by Jeb, his wife
and kids,' she said.

If he runs, Bush would be injecting himself into the
presidential race in a Republican Party that has moved to the
right since he left the governor's office in 2006.

More than likely: Jeb's son George P. Bush said it is more than likely that his father will run in the 2016 presidential election

Bush, whose wife of 40 years, Columba, was born in Mexico,
has a more welcoming view on immigration than many party
conservatives, who criticize his support for comprehensive
reform that would allow a path to legal status for undocumented
immigrants.

If Bush were to win the Republican primary and become the
party's presidential nominee, he would have to convince a
majority of Americans that it would be worthwhile to have a
third president named Bush in the Oval Office.

Worthwhile: If Bush were to win the Republican primary and become theparty's presidential nominee, he would have to convince amajority of Americans that it would be worthwhile to have athird president named Bush in the Oval Office

Traits: Jeb's uncertainty is concerning to some Republicans who say they aren't seeing traits of former Bush presidents in Jeb

Should he run, donors say Bush could get up to speed quickly
by tapping a ready network of financial supporters built from
his own alliances and from those who supported previous Bush
presidential bids.

His father and brother have publicly urged him to run.
People who know them say they are unsure of Jeb Bush's plans.

'Jeb is keeping very close counsel on what his future plans
are,' said Jim McGrath, spokesman for the elder Bush. 'I don't
think he's ready to make a decision. I think he's being very
sincere when he says he will wait until after the election to
decide.'
