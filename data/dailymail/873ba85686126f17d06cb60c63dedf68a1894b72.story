A grandmother has gone a bit off track and ended up on a tram line.

Marie Smith, 64, had to be rescued from her Nissan Qashqai after she drove it 200 yards along Manchester's Metrolink.

To add to her embarrassment a tram full of Bon Jovi fans on their way to a concert at Manchester City's Etihad stadium had to get out and walk and they jeered at her when they went past.

She blames what she sees as a lack of clear signs at a road crossing between Holt Town and Etihad Campus stations.

She said: 'It's not clearly signposted at all, I just took the right turn and before I knew it I was driving along the track.

'I was thinking about everyone else's safety and thought if I reversed I might reverse into oncoming traffic or even a tram so I kept going.

'It was an awful experience, my tyre had burst and I didn't know what to do but no-one was helping me and everyone was laughing and jeering at me.

'It was like a Roman arena with people shouting and screaming. If I was their mother I'd have been ashamed.

'It made me cross that Metrolink said the correct signage is in place because I couldn't see it.

'My worry is that it will happen again or that someone coming out of the pub across the road could walk up there and get more seriously hurt.'

However Metrolink responded by saying that there had not been an issue for 'the vast majority of motorists'.

Peter Cushing, TfGM's Metrolink director, said: 'The clear signage we've put in place near tram tracks to advise motorists is based on sound, industry-standard principles and best practice - and has been agreed with Manchester council.

'We understand that changes to the road layout can be confusing and appreciate that the changes will involve a period of adjustment and familiarisation for drivers.

'Considering how many cars pass through the area on any given day, we do not believe it is an issue for the vast majority of motorists.'

The track runs along the main road before bearing left away from the main carriageway.

Circular blue signs reading ‘tram only' are in place at either side of the entrance to the tram line at the busy junction - which links Ashton New Road with Every Street and Beswick Street.
