Police found a stolen Caterpillar telescopic loader, which had been used in the raid, doused in petrol and set on fire.

Thieves used a digger to smash a huge hole in a convenience store wall so they could steal a cash machine

The Warner's Budgens in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, was attacked just before 2am yesterday 

Police found a yellow Caterpillar telescopic loader on fire outside the shop which was used in the theft 

The theft, which took place at 2am yesterday, comes weeks after another cash machine theft in Malvern and another attempted ATM theft in Sapcote, Leicestershire.

During the incident in Malvern, the cash machine was ripped from the the wall of a Marks and Spencer store in the town's retail park, leaving a 10ft hole.

The digger used in that raid was also left at the scene.   

Police are now investigating whether or not the offences are linked. 

After the incident, Jerry Tweney, store manager of Budgens, said: 'We got alerted about it around 1.50am, and there was a huge JCB on fire.

'We think it has been used to ram into the wall just over the cash machine and used to pull the machine out.

'We don't know what they loaded the machine onto. It all happened really quickly, all within four to five minutes.

Thieves fled from the scene with the cash machine, but left the stolen digger outside the shop (pictured) 

'CCTV managed to pick up the lights from the JCB. They set fire to it.

'It looks like they poured petrol over it and then set it on fire. It also looks like they might have hot wired it.' 

The shop continued to trade as the damage only destroyed part of the customer toilets and staff canteen.

Mr Tweney said: 'We've never had this happen to us before. Everyone is a little shocked.'  

It is not the first time this has happened in Moreton. In August 2011, thieves used farming machines to smash into the Tesco store, also on the High Street, in the early hours of the morning.

In that instance, a Redrock handler vehicle was used, and it was believed no cash was taken.

Ram raiders also smashed into an antiques centre in the town in 2009.  

The theft comes weeks after another cash machine theft in Malvern (pictured) in which a digger left a 10ft hole in the side of a Marks & Spencer store 

Steve Farnsworth, who owns Grimes House Gallery, near Budgens, who shops was previously targeted by thieves, said: 'Events of this nature seem to be happening again.

'I know there have been a few incidents in the Cotswolds, and a few here as well. It's something I'm very sad to see have happened again, and I hope the police will catch the people responsible.

'The police need to stamp their authority on this, and find the people as soon as possible. I'm very sad for the staff at the store and it's something no one wants to see.' 

Detective Constable Jon Newton said: 'We are investigating all lines of enquiry at this time in order to keep an open mind on this offence.

'However we are not ruling out that it may be related to other similar offences that have taken place recently within the region.

'We do appeal for anyone who was in the area and may have seen something to contact the police.'

Anyone with information should call the police at 101, quoting incident 29 of November 17.
