While the Duchess of Cambridge oozed glamour as she gave a ceremonial welcome to the president of Singapore, many could be forgiven for thinking the rest of her family might have been enjoying the benefits of her royal lifestyle.

But as Kate, who is around 13 weeks pregnant with her second child with Prince William, rubbed shoulders with fellow royalty  in London, her parents and sister were mingling with  the public at a remote airport hundreds of miles away.

Carole, Michael and Pippa Middleton proved they are not too posh to fly economy class as they boarded an easyJet flight from the Scottish Highlands to London Gatwick yesterday.

Pippa and her mother Carole (circled) could be seen boarding the flight which was destined for London Gatwick. Despite opting to take the budget airliner, the family chose to pay £12 each for priority boarding

However, while the trio -  spotted arriving with hand luggage at Inverness Airport - may have opted for the cheap travel option, they did at least fork out up to £12 each for priority boarding.

With tickets available for as little as £54 for the 600-mile journey, Pippa, 31, and her parents shocked onlookers as they waited in the terminal before boarding the budget flight.

One passenger on the plane, who asked not to be named, said: 'We saw them wandering around the terminal.

'Inverness is a tiny airport, and there was only one plane on the runway, otherwise I might have thought they were flying in a private jet. They're rich enough, I suppose.

'I think they had paid to select their seats, which meant they got to board the plane first, and were all sat in a row when I finally made it on the plane.

'They're practically royalty, but it's nice to know that they're not too posh to fly with normal people.'

After the 80-minute flight, the Middletons got off with their hand luggage and disappeared through the airport.

Their journey came while Kate, 32, entertained Singapore president Tony Tan Keng Yam and his wife Mary on their official tour to Britain.

The Duchess was joined by her husband Prince William as she greeted the president on behalf of the Queen at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, west London.

Following the state visit, the Duchess - who until yesterday had not been seen in public for more than seven weeks after suffering severe morning sickness - attended a glamorous black tie event at London’s Natural History Museum.

The royal took some time for herself at Kensington Palace between the two official engagements before stepping out in the evening to present awards to the winners of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition at the museum.

The Middletons' outing on the easyJet flight is not the first time they have flown with a budget airline. 

In September last year, Pippa flew to Bari airport in Italy, with her parents and brother-in-law, Prince Harry, with the same airline.

However, she is more accustomed to luxurious trips abroad and has been spotted in the past jetting off to the likes of the private Caribbean island of Mustique, Verbier in Switzerland, the Austrian ski resort of Lech and India.

Her mother Carole has also spent many a time in the skies, having been a British Airways stewardess for several years before going into business and founding the family's company Party Pieces in 1987.
