Three animal shelter employees in southeast Ohio have pleaded not guilty to charges of inhumanely killing dogs.

The Gallia County dog warden, his assistant and a former warden are accused of killing dogs by injecting a drug directly into their hearts without using a sedative, which veterinarians say causes extreme pain before death.

The misdemeanor animal cruelty charges were filed after necropsies done at Ohio State University's veterinary hospital showed that several of the dogs recovered from the county animal shelter were inhumanely euthanized.

Charged: The Gallia County dog warden, Paul Simmer, seen here, could face up to eight years in jail

Alleged cruelty: Former assistant Jason Harris is charged with 12 counts of second-degree misdemeanor animal cruelty

An animal autopsy referred to as a 
necropsy, done at The Ohio State University's Veterinary Medical Center 
shows several of the 12 dogs recovered from the county animal shelter 
were killed by injecting a barbiturate into their heart or nearby 
organs.

The necropsy also shows one of the dogs sustained blunt force trauma, another trauma to the head.

'The
 necropsy showed evidence [that] shows the animals were euthanized by a 
method we call heart stick,' said John Bell, the Ohio Society for the 
Prevention and Cruelty to Animals' (Ohio SPCA) attorney.

The city solicitor and animal rights groups said shoving a needle into the dog's heart without first using a sedative causes the dogs excruciating pain and suffering some for least a half-hour before their death.

'Devastated that the animals had to go through something like that,' said Diane Amann, a shelter volunteer, to NBC 4.

According to the Friends of Gallia County’s Animals, a local rescue group, the dogs had been vaccinated and were in the process of being adopted when the deaths occurred.

The euthanizations occurred one day before a planned adoption event.

Ohio SPCA’s Executive Director Teresa Landon, the Grove City, Ohio-based animal group has a launched a “full-scale investigation” into the deaths of the 11 dogs

'We have received information that leads us to believe that the dogs were killed by intra-cardiac injection without sedation,' Landon said. 'If this is true, the dogs suffered a horrifying death.'

Intra-cardiac injection, otherwise known as a 'heart stick,' is only legal if a dog has been properly sedated and is unconscious, Landon said.

Gallia County Shelter: The alleged abused took place over a period of several years

Standing his ground: Jason Harris who worked at the shelter has pleaded not guilty to all of the abuse charges

Waste of life? The misdemeanor animal cruelty charges were filed after necropsies done at Ohio State University's veterinary hospital showed that several of the dogs recovered from the county animal shelter were inhumanely euthanized

Dog warden Paul Simmer, his assistant, Jason Harris, and former warden Jean Daniels pleaded not guilty to the charges in Gallipolis Municipal Court on Tuesday. They are due back in court next week

Simmers, the county’s dog warden, faces 32 counts of animal cruelty. His former assistant, Harris, faces 12 counts, while Daniels, a former county dog warden, faces 13 counts.

Each charge, is punishable by up to 90 days incarceration, a $750 fine, five years’ probation and 200 hours of community service, meaning Simmers could be facing eight years in jail with Harris and Daniels looking at three each.

It is alleged that the trio negligently caused unnecessary pain and suffering to dogs being euthanized at the animal shelter.

The case came to light shortly after Feb. 14 when the Grove City-based Ohio Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals said it planned to 'fully investigate' the deaths of the 11 dogs.
