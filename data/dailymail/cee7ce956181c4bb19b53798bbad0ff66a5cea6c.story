Holiday in danger: Toni Hedley, her daughter Lacey-Grace and son Mason, who has no passport

A six-year-old boy could miss a long-awaited family holiday next week after becoming the latest victim of Britain's passport crisis.

Toni Hedley has been saving for almost a year to fly with her son Mason Williams to Marmaris, Turkey, on Wednesday - but he still has no travel documents, putting the whole holiday in jeopardy.

However, despite Ms Hedley, 23, from Gateshead, first applying for his passport on May 15, the Home Office has now promised the document will be ready in time.

Ms Hedley booked the trip for seven family members almost a year ago because she knew she would have to miss her mother's wedding, which took place in term time.

So the 23-year-old carer, her son Mason and daughter Lacey-Grace Williams planned to hold a belated celebration along with her mother, sister, brother-in-law and nephew.

On May 15 she attempted to apply for a passport online for Mason, whose travel documents had expired.

But the Passport Office told her there were technical problems with her online application, and they would have to send her a paper declaration form in the post.

She asked them to do so - but it took two weeks to arrive, she said.

Ms Hedley said she returned it immediately, but since then she has had to wait another three weeks. Now there are just days left before the trip, which cost £900 for Ms Hedley and her children.

She said: 'My mum got married in Turkey in May and we couldn’t go because the kids were in school.

'So we booked this as close to the school holidays as possible and I have saved all year for it.

'I have just been calling and calling... I can’t understand how someone can promise this and then not ring us.

'It is so frustrating. I cannot stop crying and Mason is so upset. Nobody has told us anything.'

Mason's mother said: 'I was speaking to the dinner ladies at his school and they were saying how excited he had been. He has been counting down the days'

Mason was due to meet several members of his new grandfather's family, who are all from Turkey, for the first time and is now distraught.

'I could not leave him,' said his mother. 'It is just awful, if I have to stay at home my daughter will also miss out on a holiday but we are not going to leave him.

'It is tearing the family apart.

'I was speaking to the dinner ladies at his school and they were saying how excited he had been. He has been counting down the days.'

Since Ms Hedley's dilemma appeared in her local newspaper the Chronicle, however, the family have been offered a possible reprieve.

They have been contacted by the Passport Office and told Mason's travel documents will hopefully be ready on Monday to be picked up from an office in Liverpool.

Chaos: Pictures

Government to introduce emergency measures

It is a 350-mile round trip - but Ms Hedley said it would be worth it to end the chaos.

The Passport Office said it was 'working to ensure' all customers receive their official documents within the expected timeframe but said it was also 'doing everything possible to speed up the system'.

A spokesman said: 'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years.

'We are working to ensure that our customers receive their passports within our service standards and are determined to do everything possible to speed up the system, while maintaining the security of the passport.

'The Home Secretary has announced a series of additional measures to ensure people and families receive their passports in good time for their summer holidays. These include bringing in extra staff and extending opening hours to seven days a week.

'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades and extensions on the passports of overseas customers.'

The case is just one of tens of thousands caught up in a huge passport backlog which emerged last month, when photos were leaked of stacks of orange binders in the Liverpool processing centre.

The revelation prompted an apology in the Commons from Home Secretary Theresa May.

Speaking on June 18, Mrs May said 11 per cent of applications were being processed within three weeks - the target waiting time.

'I would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that I am sorry and the Government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right,' she said.
