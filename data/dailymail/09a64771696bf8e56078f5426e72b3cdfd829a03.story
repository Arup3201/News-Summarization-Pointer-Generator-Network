A 20 stone woman who worked as a cleaner in a gym has transformed her body after seeking the help of her colleagues - and is now set to start a fitness career of her own.

Jade Delaney, 21 from Dublin, Ireland, shed an impressive eight stone after finding another reason to go to the gym other than work.

After constantly being surrounded by healthy people, Jade started quizzing the trainers at the gym who agreed to help her with her weight loss.

At her heaviest Jade was dubbed 'chickenball' by people in her local area for her 20st frame - but since losing the weight she has adopted a new nickname - 'shredded chicken'.

Jade said that it was working so closely with fitness experts that inspired her to drop to the pounds.

'Being around trainers all the time at work I started asking little questions about food. Then one day one of the trainers gave me a food plan with some basic diet changes,' she said.

Jade now heads to the gym at 6:30 am every morning before her cleaning shift 

'Sticking to the plan, I noticed results within a couple of months. After I had my diet sorted the next step for me was getting involved in exercise classes.'  

Her old lifestyle of snacking throughout the day and lie-ins everyday made Jade pile on the pounds.

Sick of being surrounded by fit people Jade began her weight loss in December 2013 and less than a year later had slimmed down to 11st.  

But Jade has now cut down on high carbohydrate foods such as bread and potatoes and done away with junk food helping her shed the weight.

Jade is enrolling in a college in September to study fitness hopes to become a personal trainer herself 

As well as swapping her eating regime , she's up at 6:30am every morning in the gym before she starts her cleaning job there later in the day.

Jade said she made a conscious effort to surround herself with people who would inspire her to get fit.

'I had to separate myself from certain people who would demotivate me and stick with friends and family who supported me 100% and were positive about fitness.

'Now, I never want to go back to that lifestyle. I want to help people and inspire them to do what I've done.'

Rather than rely on scales throughout her weight loss Jade studied her physical appearance and mental state to judge her progress. Pictured: Jade before her weight loss (left) and Jade now (right) 

Jade, who is enrolling in college in September to study fitness and leisure management, never weighed herself throughout her journey.

Instead, she used her physical appearance and mental state to judge how well she was doing.

She has also started up her very own fitness blog where every day she posts videos and workouts to help other start their own weight loss journey.

Jade said: 'People are too obsessed with checking the scales, if you're training right and eating well you shouldn't have to worry about the scales.

'This time last year I was a completely different person. I feel like I've found my calling.

'I never knew I would have lost all this weight and now I'm on the road to becoming a personal trainer.'

Jade added that she wanted to prove to others that anyone can exercise and that the gym should not be avoided.  

'I want to tell people there's no need to be afraid of the gym, classes are the best thing to do. It's going that is the first step and the decision to change your life is what is important.'
