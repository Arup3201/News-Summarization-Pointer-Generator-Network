A boss at banking firm Goldman Sachs has apologised to his neighbours after work on his £7million town house caused cracks to appear in their homes.

One woman had to be rescued from her flat after the work caused so much subsidence that she could not open her door.

Other neighbours have complained of cracks in their walls and stairways following the basement excavation at Christoph Stanger's home in Kensington, London.

Causing cracks: The excavation at Christoph Stanger's home which has damaged adjoining properties

Building site: The digging has led to subsidence, causing cracks to appear in neighbours' homes

Mr Stanger, a managing director who heads Goldman Sachs' German and Austrian financing group, has offered to compensate his neighbours for the damage to their properties.

The 46-year-old, who bought his four-storey Victorian home 18 months ago, is spending £1million to dig out the basement.

But emergency building teams had to be called in last Sunday when a pillar holding up the property's portico started to crack under the pressure.

Ten tons of roofing has been removed and the front of the building is covered in scaffolding, steel joists and planks.

Mr Stanger was granted planning permission for an underground extension in May last year despite objections from nine of the 11 locals consulted by Kensington and Chelsea Council.

Louise Stael von Holstein, who has lived in a flat next door for 30 years, told the Evening Standard: 'They’ve been digging since the beginning of the year, down into the basement, and it’s caused the house to subside.

'The basement flat in my block has got cracks everywhere.'

Another neighbour said they had been forced to call out the contractors six times in three weeks to open their front door.

Mr Stanger, who intends to move into the house with his family in January, said the work was necessary to build a playroom for his children and a guest room.

He said: 'I feel bad about the disruption and if there is any real damage it will be dealt with and they will be compensated.'

A spokesman for the council said it was aware that basement extensions caused concern for residents.
