Leinster's players may be sporting a few bruises after a full blooded pre-season boxing session. 

The reigning RaboDirect Pro 12 champions held an open training session on Friday that was certainly physical. 

Rhys Ruddock proved to be a natural as he landed a vicious jab flush on Mike McCarthy's nose.

Ruddock was later seen sparring team-mate Kevin McLaughlin as Leinster's players were put through their paces. 

The players were then seen wrestling before doing some running as look to get up to speed ahead of the new season. 

The Irish champions take on Northampton Saints in a friendly on August 23 before facing rivals Ulster a week later. They kick off their title defence against Glasgow Warriors on September 5.
