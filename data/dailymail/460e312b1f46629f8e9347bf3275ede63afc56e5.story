Roger Federer led a parade of the world’s leading tennis players down the sweeping staircase of a luxury boat that cruised along the Thames on Friday night.

The top eight players, minus the absent Rafael Nadal, were suited and booted, with Andy Murray delighted to be involved, especially compared to what he was doing this time 12 months ago.

Back then the only thing he had to look forward to during the week of the Barclays ATP World Finals was the Groundhog Day of painful recovery work from the back operation he had a month previously.

Although a big football fan, the constant visits to Chelsea’s Cobham training ground were not something to relish.

‘Most days I did rehab from nine in the morning through until five-something,’ he recalled. 

‘In the mornings, I was doing my rehab at Chelsea’s training ground and then, in the afternoons, I would either go back there or I have a space in my house where I have a few bits and pieces of equipment. 

'I could do some Pilates, core-type exercises and more rehab.

‘When you’re away from the game, you realise how much you miss playing but I wasn’t bitter about not being here, it’s just part of what we do. 

'Some people go through their whole career without any injuries, some are injury prone and I would say I’ve been fairly lucky. 

'Last year was obviously tough but I certainly watched bits of the tennis here.’

At 2pm on Sunday he will be the subject of TV viewers’ attention as he takes on Japan’s Kei Nishikori in the opening round robin match, while Federer against Milos Raonic is the evening’s main attraction. Considering the finals take place in his adopted hometown, and he is a decent indoor player, Murray has never done as well as he might at the O2, a semi-final being his best finish to date.

Having worked so hard to make the top eight this year he is committed to try to improve on that and set himself up for 2015. Beating Nishikori and improving on his 3-0 record against him would be a perfect start.

‘I’m not exactly where I would like to be, I still want to get four or five per cent better. But compare it to where I was four or five months ago and I am much, much closer,’ added Murray.
