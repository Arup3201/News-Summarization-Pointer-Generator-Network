India batsman Virat Kohli says Australia’s players called him a spoilt brat and that he has no reason to respect Mitchell Johnson.

Kohli scored 169 on the third day of the third Test at the MCG in Melbourne during which he and Johnson exchanged plenty of verbals.

‘It was going on throughout the day,’ said Kohli. ‘They were calling me a spoilt brat. I said, “Maybe that’s the way I am — you guys hate me and I like that”. It worked in my favour I guess.’

India are 2-0 down in the four-match Test series but Kohli has scored three centuries.

At one point during the third day, Johnson hit Kohli with the ball when throwing for the stumps. Kohli put on 262 with Ajinkya Rahane to help India to 462 for eight in reply to Australia’s first-innings 530.

Johnson did take Kohli’s wicket with the final ball of the day but ended up with figures of one for 133.

The India batsman insisted that he has no respect for Johnson after the game

‘I respect quite a few of them. But someone who does not respect me, I’ve got no reason to respect him,’ said Kohli of Johnson.

In Brisbane, Andrew Flintoff took two wickets and scored 15 runs from 10 balls as his Brisbane Heat side beat the Melbourne Stars in Australia’s Big Bash League.

Across the Tasman Sea, Dimuth Karunaratne’s maiden Test hundred helped Sri Lanka fight back against New Zealand in Christchurch.

Johnson eventually took Kohli's wicket but finished the day with figures of one for 133

The tourists, bowled out for 138 in their first-innings reply to New Zealand’s 441, were much improved as Karunaratne’s 152 helped them to 293 for five at the close of day three.

Meanwhile, off-spinner Saeed Ajmal has withdrawn from Pakistan’s World Cup squad as his bowling action is yet to be cleared by the ICC.

However, banned compatriot Mohammad Hafeez is to have checks before potentially applying for a test on his bowling action.
