There is a knock on the door at 7.15am. What could the matter be?

I abandon my ablutions and open the door. A man is standing with two newspapers I had ordered. Presumably, the knock at weekends is even earlier.

It is not a great start to the day. But then, just about everything about the newly opened Dorsett has jarred from the moment we set foot inside the huge, soulless lobby that has all the charm of an airport hotel in Nowheresville.

Impressive on the outside: The Dorsett Shepherd's Bush has been slotted into the former Pavilion Cinema

This is doubly disappointing because it is terrific from the outside. The listed building started out as the Pavilion Cinema in 1923 and looks across Shepherd’s Bush Green in West London.

It is Chinese-owned - which might explain the clashing, shiny interiors. Signs are written in English and Mandarin.

Apparently, lots of Chinese stay here to be near the Westfield Shopping Centre.

Check-in takes an age. The printer is not working and the receptionist keeps going behind the scenes to sort it out. I’m paying £150, room only. She tells me that if I want a bath I can upgrade to an ‘executive room’ for an extra £20. I ask if she can upgrade me for nothing given that there are 317 rooms and dozens of those are empty. She won’t budge. I push it some more and she relents.

The corridors have empty cheap picture frames on the walls. They look absurd.

It’s a relief to get to the room, which is fine in a gauche sort of way. We like the bed, with its white leather headboard and the Chinese wallpaper behind it. The rest of it is tinny.

We pop our noses into the restaurant off the lobby, but the smell of stale food and the bright lights repel us. The receptionist had said the hotel has ‘an arrangement’ with the Chinese restaurant next door, so we go there instead. Turns out there is no arrangement at all, save for their being an entrance to it from the lobby.

A spacious sort of welcome: The lobby is certainly large, but our Inspector considered it 'soulless'

The heating isn’t working properly in our room, you can’t open the windows and the bathroom is cramped.

Breakfast is complicated. For £12 you get tea or coffee and access to the continental buffet. I ask for a double espresso but am told it will cost extra.

‘I only intend to have two scoops of yogurt,’ I tell the restaurant manager. ‘Are you really going to charge me £12 and then insist that I pay extra for the coffee.’

‘I’m sorry, but that is what it costs,’ he says, politely. But when he asks me to sign the chit, he can’t bring himself to charge for the coffee.

Lo and behold, the printer is still not working when I check out, and the whole process takes ten minutes. They email my receipt later.

Best that can be said is that Dorsett is a work in progress.
