Doomed marriage: Prince Charles and Diana during a royal tour of Hungary

The BBC has pulled a documentary which sheds light on Prince Charles’s attempts to repair his battered image following the death of Princess Diana.

Reinventing The Royals is said to be critical of the prince’s attempt to rebuild his reputation and increase public sympathy for Camilla Parker Bowles.

According to the documentary, Charles’s methods left the teenage Prince William feeling he had been ‘used to further his father’s interests’ after details of his first meeting with Mrs Parker Bowles ten months after Diana’s death were leaked to a journalist.

The BBC has now postponed the two-part programme, which was due to start broadcasting this Sunday, after an intervention from lawyers known to represent senior royals including Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, according to the Radio Times.

The BBC2 documentary is presented by Steve Hewlett, the editor of Panorama during its infamous interview with Diana in 1995 in which she referred to Charles’s affair with Mrs Parker Bowles, saying: ‘There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.’

Mr Hewlett says in an article for the Radio Times that Charles hired Mark Bolland from the Press Complaints Commission to act as his media advisor in what was a departure for the royal family.

He says Mr Bolland tried to repair the Prince’s battered image by taking every opportunity to show his different side as a single parent and caring father. 

His other objective was to increase public acceptance for the woman Charles described as a ‘non-negotiable’ part of his life – Mrs Parker Bowles, who is now Duchess of Cornwall. 

The decision to postpone was taken late in the day, after the programme was included in schedules released to television listing magazines.

Royal sources expressed surprise as the royal press office had appeared relaxed about the documentary. 

Sandy Henney, press secretary to Charles at the time of Diana’s death, told the documentary how when she started her job in 1993 he was being subjected to ‘virulent criticism’ as a bad father who was often compared unfavourably to Diana.

She said: ‘I think he was pretty hurt... if you’ve got a middle-aged balding man and a beautiful princess, it’s a no-brainer as to who is going to get the media coverage.’

Mr Hewlett said 15-year-old Prince William was left distraught when The Sun reported details of his first meeting with Mrs Parker Bowles in June 1998 – less than ten months after Diana died in a Paris car crash. 

Miss Henney told the documentary: ‘He [William] was understandably really upset because it was private. And apart from being angry and upset that this had got out, he wanted to know how it had happened.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC is delaying broadcast of Reinventing The Royals until later in the New Year while a number of issues including the use of archive footage are resolved.’ Clarence House said: ‘Scheduling is a matter for the broadcasters.’
