As the title winners Manchester City go toe-to-toe with FA Cup holders Arsenal at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, a glittering array of stars will be on show at the home of English football. From David Silva and Yaya Toure to Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez, this will be a meeting of some of the finest footballers in the Barclays Premier League. But who comes out on top in the head-to-head battles? Sportsmail runs the rule over these two teams... 

Goalkeeper

Joe Hart

A shaky start to last season culminated in the England No 1 find himself on the bench for an extended spell in the winter. Turned out to be smart management by Manuel Pellegrini and Hart demonstrated his class in the second half of the season with several match-winning saves. Will face competition from new signing Willy Caballero, mind.

England's No 1: Joe Hart got better as last season went on after a shaky start

Wojciech Szczesny

Last season, the Polish stopper eliminated much of the rash decision-making that had previously blotted his copybook to enjoy his finest campaign so far.

All smiles: Wojciech Szczesny will hope Arsenal can build on their FA Cup triumph 

Verdict: Joe Hart. A proven winner, having won two titles in three years, and a powerful voice in the Manchester City dressing room. Expect him to step up once more with Caballero in town.

Right Back

Pablo Zabaleta

Relentless up and down the right flank, he is an immensely likeable character, firm in the tackle and a menace going forward. Offers a regular threat making those overlapping runs.

Mathieu Debuchy

The summer signing from Newcastle always tend to appear to be a better player in the blue of France than the black and white stripes in the North East. Enjoyed an impressive World Cup but has work to do to convince in the Premier League.

Strong at the back: Pablo Zabaleta pips Arsenal new boy Mathieu Debuchy to the best right back  

Verdict: Pablo Zabaleta. Along with Philip Lahm, Zabaleta is seen as the finest full-back in world football and he’d walk into any team in the Barclays Premier League.

Centre-Back

Vincent Kompany

The Belgian centre-half is City’s most important player. The captain – who is currently discussing a new contract – is an inspirational leader and an outstanding defender.

Leader of men: Vincent Kompany guided Manchester City to the Premier League title last season

Calum Chambers

The new £12m signing will get his first experience of what it is like playing for Arsenal in a cup final. The test will be for him to keep the composure he showed at Southampton now that he is in the big time. 

Step up: Calum Chambers will be out to prove he can take his form from Southampton to Arsenal

Verdict: Vincent Kompany. Chambers is a talented young defender with plenty of potential but Kompany has proved for several years that he is the most complete centre-back in English football.

Centre-back

Martin Demichelis

The Argentine struggled in his early days at Manchester City but has emerged through that tricky spell and demonstrated his credentials as an accomplished centre-half. Part of the Argentina side that reached the World Cup final.

New look: Martin Demichelis is back at City with a new short back and sides after the World Cup

Laurent Koscielny

Koscielny’s more impulsive tendencies harnessed well with Mertesacker’s more serene approach last season. The Frenchman is quick, powerful and is also a threat at set-pieces.

Getting stuck in: Laurent Koscielny and Olivier Giroud fight for the ball in training 

Verdict: Laurent Koscielny. The 28-year-old has matured into an excellent defender under Wenger’s guidance and he only seems to be getting better. Demichelis’ lack of pace remains a concern, underlined by Manuel Pellegrini’s pursuit of Eliaquim Mangala.

Left-back

Gael Clichy

Prone to the odd mistake and his concentration can lapse from time to time. Good energy and offers pace in the attacking third.

Kieran Gibbs

The Englishman was one of Arsenal’s most consistent performers last season and if this country were not so blessed in the left-back position – Gibbs had to compete with Ashley Cole, Luke Shaw and Leighton Baines – he would have been a shoe-in for the World Cup in Brazil.

Defending the left: Gael Clichy will come up against his former club and Kieran Gibbs

Verdict: Kieran Gibbs. With Ashley Cole now out of the picture, Gibbs can press for an England place and continue to star for Arsenal.

Central Midfield

Fernandinho

The Brazilian was magnificent in his debut season, complementing Yaya Toure in the central acres and dominating the midfield. Incredible energy levels and sets the tempo. Interesting to see if he can recover his confidence after Brazil’s traumatic World Cup campaign.

Commanding: Fernandinho (left) impressed during his first season with Manchester City

Welsh wizard: Aaron Ramsey had a good season before his injury last season

Aaron Ramsey

The Welshman emerged as the division’s best player in the first half of last season, scoring 13 goals before the end of November. An injury set him back in the second half of the season but reclaimed the spotlight with the winning goal in the FA Cup final against Hull.

Verdict: Aaron Ramey. A difficult one but if Ramsey replicates the form he showed this time last year, Arsenal have one of the world’s most talented midfield players on their hands.

Central midfield

Yaya Toure

Birthday cakes and summer shenanigans aside, Toure is the best midfielder in the country. He is a match-winner, scoring 24 goals as City won the title last season. Keep lighting those candles, City fans, because Yaya is irreplaceable.

Pass master: Yaya Toure helped City win the Premier League title last season

Middle man: Jack Wilshere will hope to have an injury free season 

Jack Wilshere

Career has stagnated after such a blistering start and the images that emerged of Wilshere smoking on holiday did little to correct the feeling that this player could be taking his opportunity more seriously. Has to score more goals and repay the faith that Wenger continues to show in him this season.

Verdict: Yaya Toure. Wilshere’s most valuable asset is potential while Toure is proven at the highest level.

Attacking midfield 

Samir Nasri

His national team harshly overlooked the Frenchman for the World Cup, particularly after such an impressive campaign last season. City, however, have a very gifted footballer who has had a nice long break this summer. Former Arsenal man may feel he has something to prove to his old employers.

Exile: Samir Nasri was left out of the France World Cup squad despite a good season for City 

Big money move: A lot will be expected from Alexis Sanchez after his arrival this summer

Alexis Sanchez

The Chilean was one of the stars at the World Cup and represents a major coup for Arsenal. An explosive forward blessed with pace, skill and goals.

Verdict: Alexis Sanchez. The former Barcelona man is the most exciting player to be signed by a Premier League club this summer. Expect Nasri to have another good season, though.

Attacking Midfield

David Silva

The Spaniard is City’s conductor, pulling strings most players can’t even see. His touch is immaculate and his passing is deeply intelligent. Such a wonderful player to watch.

On the attack: David Silva was key for City last season  and Mesut Ozil impressed in his debut season

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Oxlade-Chamberlain had a stop-start season last time around picking up a cruciate knee ligament injury on the opening day before returning in good form in January, only to be troubled by a groin problem at the end of the campaign. 

Verdict: As impressive as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain when injury free, you have to go for David Silva for his sheer consistency in a Manchester City shirt. 

Attacking midfield

Stevan Jovetic

Only made two Premier League starts amid a plague of injuries last season but he has been City’s star performer in pre-season and he believes he is now ready to become a key man. May get the nod over Sergio Aguero due to the Argentine's late return for pre-season.

Back from injury: Stevan Jovetic made only just two Premier League starts last season due to injury

Bright future: Santi Cazorla has proved to be one of the more exciting players in the Premier League

Santi Cazorla

Arsenal have resisted interest from Atletico Madrid for the talented midfielder and he will light up the Premier League once more this season. On his day, Cazorla is a real joy to behold.

Verdict: Santi Cazorla. Cazorla has proven himself in the Premier League over several seasons. The same cannot be said of Jovetic. Yet.

Striker

Edin Dzeko

The Bosnian stepped up when Alvaro Negredo lost his goalscoring touch last season, hitting over 25 goals for Manuel Pellegrini to prove his importance to the City cause.

Clinical finisher: Edin Dzeko has proved to be lethal in front of goal for City

Gunner be a star: Yaya Sanogo has looked good in pre-season for Arsenal 

Yaya Sanogo

Arsene Wenger has suggested that this game may come too soon for Olivier Giroud. Sanogo scored four goals against Benfica last season after a tricky first season in the first-team last time out.

Verdict: Edin Dzeko. The Bosnian is a clinical finisher and powerful in the air. Provides City with something different in the final third.

Overall verdict 

Manchester City 6-5 Arsenal
