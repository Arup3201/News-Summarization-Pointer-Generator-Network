A World War Two veteran who wrote poetry during lulls in fighting on the front line has secured a publishing deal at the age of 91.

Dennis Wilson scribbled verse in his official Field Service Pocket Book as he sheltered in slit trenches during the 1944 D-Day landings.

The 22-year-old soldier wrote about the horror of war and the life-changing injuries he sustained during enemy action in Normandy.

Dennis Wilson has had his poems published 68 years after he wrote them on the battlefields of Normandy

'The Wilfred Owen of World War Two': Dennis was 22 when he was sent to war in northern France

He even ripped pages from his book 
and sent copies home to his mother in Southampton, Hampshire, so his 
work would survive if he died in battle.

Now
 Dennis has finally made it into print after a researcher at Goldsmiths 
College, University of London, read his collection of poems.

Tim
 Crook, who lectures on propaganda and the use of information in war, 
described Dennis as the 'Wilfred Owen of World War Two'.

He discovered the poems while writing a book on Dennis’s father Alexander Wilson, who worked as a spy and wrote espionage novels.

Recognition: Dennis was offered the publishing deal after a researcher found his poems in his mother's papers

Dedicated: Dennis learned to write with his left hand after being injured, and continues to write today

Dennis joined the Royal Artillery in 
1941 as a lance bombardier but was sent to Normandy with the 1st 
Tyneside Scottish Battalion, the black watch.

He was in Rauray, France, for 21 days, during which time he witnessed horrific scenes that still haunt him to this day.

Injured in shelling, he returned to England with a broken right arm, damaged hip and ripped bladder.

The anthology of 125 poems 'covers profound human experiences and is drawn from a life spanning 92 years'

But Dennis refused to give up poetry and continued to work from his hospital bed after learning to write with his left hand.

Dennis,
 who now lives in Southampton, says: 'I have read poetry all my life and
 was gripped by poets such as Tennyson, Wordsworth and Keats at school.

'I lived my teenage years talking in couplets and felt compelled to write down my thoughts in the form of poems.

Discovery: Senior lecturer Tim Crook found the poems

'I
 wrote my first poem at the age of 16. It was about Armistice Day and 
how the young men who gave their lives should never be forgotten.

'That turned out to be the first of many, as I continued write throughout the war and even today.

'Many people think war is a continuous horror but you don’t face a continual barrage of bullets.

'There were quiet times in the trenches, when I was just sitting and waiting.

'It was at times like this that I pulled out my pocket book and wrote about the irony and tragedy of war as I saw it.

'I was not writing for an audience but did hope my poems would be published one day.

'I sent them to my mum to look after because I knew there was a risk I would fail to make it home.'

Dennis describes his work as 'the reflections of an ordinary soldier, of any nationality, temporarily withdrawn from the front line to an area of comparative peace, in any of the wars to which unwilling Mankind has been subjected by the ambitions, greed or stupidity of his rulers'.

What has war done to the Youth of the World?

It has trained him; mentally to be alert always, and to think swiftly;

Physically to endure without food, without sleep, and often without hope.

It has taught him to gaze on the friend who fell beside him in battle,

With less compassion and anger than inward relief:

Relief that the bullet found a heart other than his own;

But relief followed instantly by guilt that will never go away.

It has taught him to think of the enemy framed in the sights of his rifle

Without pity, but with only the kill-or-be-killed instincts of the jungle;

And not as a man like himself, with an anxious wife and children;

With a small house, and a garden in which to rest on Summer ev’nings:

As a man who cares as little for the purpose of the war as he does himself,

And is even now thinking longingly of home...War has made him incurably restless, in a world grown madly impatient;

It has caused him to seek any form of gaudy entertainment promising forgetfulness.

It had shown him there is nothing so mean, so lacking-in-glory as war;

And the common peoples of the earth desire only friendship and peace;

But there always will be war, because their Rulers and Mentors lead them away from peace.

It has taught him that the common peoples must unite and destroy the causes of war

Before their Rulers fail again, and they perish with the whole of the species of Humankind

He hopes readers will reflect on the 'horrors' of war, 'I don’t think for one minute that my poems will stop people fighting but I do hope they will make people pause for a moment and think.

'Some of what I witnessed was so horrific it still pains me to talk about it. I only talk about those experiences with people who were there.

'On my final day on the frontline, we became surrounded by Germans and I was hit by shells as we tried to make our escape.

'I was in agony and initially thought I was going to lose my arm.'But I later realised I had been lucky and it was one of the happiest days of my life because it proved to be my ticket out of there.'

Dennis dedicated one poem to a nurse who cared for him as he recovered from his injuries.

He says he is 'delighted' to have secured a publishing deal 'because it shows my work has a commercial value.

'It is now being read by more people, who can learn about the horrors of war.

'It is an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as poets like Wilfred Owen.'

Dennis was posted to Scotland after he was discharged from hospital, having fully recovered.

There he met his barmaid wife Maisie, with whom he had two children.

On leaving the army Dennis secured a job with the Encylopaedia Britannica, where he worked until his retirement. Maisie died 12 years ago.

Senior lecturer Tim Crook says 'Dennis is devoted to literature and poetry and his own collection of poems is a treasure trove.

'He has a wonderful technique, which he combines with feeling and insight to produce something very special.

'He captures the despair, fear and sadness of war like the poetic greats of World War One, such as Wilfred Owen and Seigfried Sassoon.

'I was very moved by his work and believed his work deserved a wider audience. It is now selling very well.'

Dennis’ book, called Elegy of a Common Soldier, contains 125 poems and is published by Kultura Press.
