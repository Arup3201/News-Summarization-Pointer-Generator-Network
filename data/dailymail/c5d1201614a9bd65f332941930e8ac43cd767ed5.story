More than 100,000 Americans have called for Piers Morgan to be deported from the U.S. after he criticized pro-gun campaigners on his television show.

A petition on the White House website accuses the TV host of undermining the 'rights of Americans.'

The signatures surpassed the 100,000 mark after Morgan published a 2,500-word piece in the Daily Mail in which he concluded that if the U.S. does not change its gun laws he would 'seriously consider deporting myself.'

Divisive: A petition has been launched to deport Piers Morgan after he has taken a strict stance on gun laws

Any petition posted on the site that attracts more than 25,000 signatures guarantees a response from the U.S. government. The petition was launched after Mr Morgan
repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his nightly CNN shows following 
the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20 children and six 
sadults died.

He called Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners for America, an 'idiot,' 'dangerous' and an 'unbelievably stupid man' after he argued 
that more guns would cut crime.

In another debate on gun control, an exasperated Mr Morgan shouted down
economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime and accused him of 'lying' over gun crime trends in foreign countries including Britain.

Gun rights advocates, who have been forced on the back foot by public 
outrage over the Connecticut school killings, were furious over the 
attacks - particularly as they came from a foreigner.

The petition on the White House website reads: 'British citizen and CNN 
television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the 
U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment [the right to keep and
bear arms].

The signatures surpassed the 100,000 mark after Morgan published a 2,500-word piece in the Daily Mail in which he concluded that if the U.S. does not change its gun laws he would consider deporting himself

'We demand that Mr Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to 
undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a 
national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of 
American citizens.'

The petition was started on December 21 by a man from Austin, Texas, who
was identified as Kurt Nimmo. US citizens can file a petition on the 
White House website and the administration has to respond if it collects
at least 25,000 signatures within 30 days.

Morgan has made it clear in TV debates that he was not attacking the 
Second Amendment, which gun advocates insist protects a citizen’s right 
to bear arms.

But the American establishment is usually terrified of doing anything 
that could be deemed anti-constitutional and even Morgan’s on-air CNN 
colleagues looked taken aback by the force of his anti-gun outbursts.

Morgan, who also writes a column in the Mail on Sunday's Live magazine, has refused to  back down.

On Twitter, the former Daily Mirror editor insisted that 'wanting 
America to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines isn't "anti-constitutional" – it’s called "common sense."'

He also joked that, if deported, he was thinking of anchoring his CNN show from Jamaica.

CNN has said it has no immediate comment on the petition but media 
pundits believe the publicity won't damage a network which is struggling
to win audiences.

Prior to the row, there had been speculation that Morgan might lose his prime-time slot.

Independent publicist Howard Bragman said that the controversy was 
likely to get Morgan noticed and may translate into higher ratings.

'A lot of it comes from his being British, he's seen the differences 
between the U.S. and UK, he's passionate and authentic in taking this 
issue on, and it's probably only going to help him attract more people 
to his show,' Mr Bragman said.

Last night an unrepentant Mr  Morgan fired back at his critics  on 
Twitter saying: 'Merry Christmas! Even to those who want me deported.'
