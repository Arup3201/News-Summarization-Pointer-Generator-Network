When his house caught on fire yesterday afternoon, a 36-year-old Elmhurst, Delaware man escaped but went back into the home to rescue his eight pit bulls, including 6 puppies.

Tragically, Nate Lewandowski never made it out after re-entering the burning building, and all but one of the pit bulls perished with him.

The fire broke out Saturday afternoon at the home Lewandowski's parents bought for him back in 1998.

For his dogs: Nate Lewandowski died Saturday afternoon after going into his burning home to save his eight pit bulls, including 6 pit bull puppies. Sadly, only one of the pit bulls survived

Selfless: Neighbors say the 36-year-old escape the fire but run back in for his dogs

Man's best friends: Lewandowski's parents said that the pit bulls were a comfort to their son after he lost his 2-month-old daughter to SIDS three years ago

Neighbor Ed Strickland told My Fox Philly that his neighbor made it safely but went back in to save his dogs.

Mr Strickland went to the house to see if he could help, and called out his neighbors name but all he could hear was the dogs.

'I could hear them whining and it was really heart-wrenching,' Mr Strickland said.

Soon after neighbors heard a loud explosion come from the house.

One survivor: Unfortunately, only one of the eight pit bulls survived the fire. Sadie (pictured) was the mother of six of the pit bull puppies that died in the fire

Blasts: Neighbors who witnessed the blaze heard a few explosions while Lewandowski was in the house that firefighters believe may have been a gas or propane tank

Passed: Emergency responders tried to resuscitate Lewandowski but he later died at Christiana hospital

When firefighters arrived on the scene, they pulled Lewandowski out of the house and tried to resuscitate him but he later died at Christiana hospital.

Only one of the pit bulls survived - the puppies' mother Sadie who also tried to get back into the house during the fire. All six of Sadie's puppies and one adult male pit bull died in the blaze. Sadie is currently being looked after by a neighbor.

Parents Ron and Maryellen Lewandowski say the pit bulls were a comfort to their son after he lost his 2-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) three years ago.

Shocked: Lewandowski's mother Maryellen (left) and stepfather Ron (right) Lewandowski were shocked when they received the call that their son had been killed in the fire

'It's horrible,' stepfather Ron Lewandowski told WPVI. 'It's just unbelievable. We were shocked when we got the call from the fire marshal.'

They say their son was currently out of work and trying to straighten out his life.

'My wife is just devastated. He's out older son and we are going to have to tell our younger son and that's going to be a very, very difficult thing to do.'

Firefighters are still unsure what caused the fire to break out Saturday afternoon, but they believe that a gas or propane tank contributed to the explosions heard.

They plan to reconstruct the burn site to figure out what happened.Â
