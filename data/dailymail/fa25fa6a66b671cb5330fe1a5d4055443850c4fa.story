They say they have the best (or, breast) of intentions. 

The director of a Gold Coast clinic which is today performing a record 23 boob jobs has defended its 'Super Friday' stunt, after it copped criticism from local doctors who were concerned it trivialised medical procedures.

Christyna Kruczaj, the director of the CosMediTours clinic at Surfer's Paradise, told Daily Mail Australia the clinic was not like a production line.

Discounted boob jobs will be offered on the Gold Coast to compete against patients heading to Asia 

'It's very far from a factory line,' Ms Kruszaj said. 'Because of the numbers people are obviously tagging it as something demonic or something.'

'It's not a factory line, it's based on surgeons per theatre and when it's feasible for them to do so.'

Ms Kruczaj told Daily Mail Australia the record breaking breast augmentation attempt was being held to shine a spotlight on the Gold Coast as a destination for medical tourism.

In recent times, thousands of Australian women have flocked to Thailand in for cut-price cosmetic surgery packages each year.

Dr Shaun Rudd, from the Australian Medical Association's Queensland branch, told local newspaper the Gold Coast Bulletin he could not support the event.

'Quality and safety are very important aspects of any work we do and to somehow trivialise these procedures doesn't sound like an appropriate thing to do,' Dr Rudd was quoted saying.

'Surgery is not something that should be taken lightly.'

Operations at the clinic are run by qualified plastic surgeons and Ms Kruszaj said today's program was well-structured and in line with medical safety regulations.

She said self image is the main reason why her clients choose to get breast implants.

'Self image is the number one factor, absolutely.'

'Everyone wants to look nice, whether they want to have big beautiful breasts or whatever that may be,' she said. 'It's a personal choice.'

The clinic has received many customers from the Gold Coast as well as clients from as far away as Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria.

Ms Kruszaj said she had received support from the local community about her attempts to muscle in on the medical tourism market.

'The Gold Coast must be open to all kinds of tourism', she said, whether that be whale-watching for plastic surgery.

She said 'time will tell' whether the clinic will attempt to break today's record.
