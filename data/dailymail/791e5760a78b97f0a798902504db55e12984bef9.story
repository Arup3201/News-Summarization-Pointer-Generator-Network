An ‘omelette on a stick’ might not appear the most appetising way to start the day.

However, the import is being presented as the ideal ‘breakfast on the go’.

It is one of the foods that can be created using the Rollie ‘vertical grill’ from the US.

Lakeland is bringing the Rollie to Britain and boasts that, as well as the simple omelette, it can create many more tasty snacks, including party canapes and sweet treats.

Essentially, the Rollie is a heated tube with a non-stick coating on the inside.

The user simply cracks two eggs and pours in the mixture and then, part way through the heating process, adds a stick down the middle as it begins to solidify.

The cylindrical omelette pops up when it is cooked in what the manufacturer, Kalorik, boasts is an ‘easy to eat’ shape.

Kalorik also claims it takes five to six minutes to cook a two-egg omelette on a stick, however video bloggers who have tried the Rollie suggest it is actually six to eight minutes. Videos on the firm’s website suggest that as well as cooking breakfast, workers could keep the device on their desk to turn out a hot lunch.

Lakeland is renowned for bringing kitchen innovations to British consumers, such as its yellow banana holder and the popular Mary Berry baking range.

However, the company faces an uphill task to win over consumers in this country to the Rollie, given the fact it has received mixed reviews in the US.

It was ridiculed on TV comedy show the Colbert Report, where host Stephen Colbert suggested it provides an answer to the question: ‘How can I make my breakfast fit more snugly into my colon?’

Critics have also identified a number of flaws.

For example, the six to eight minutes it takes to cook an egg lolly is slower than using a frying pan. At the same time, it is not suitable for a dishwasher, which means it has to be cleaned by hand.

A Lakeland spokesman said: ‘Omelettes on a stick are perfect for quick, fuss-free breakfasts but we think Rollie has so much more to offer, especially at this time of the year when parties are in full swing.

‘Perfect for making canapés, just pop your ingredients inside the vertical non-stick grill and, when cooked, lift out and slice up ready for the party platter.

'Try smoked salmon pinwheels, egg and bacon bites, mini tortilla wraps or even baby Danish pastries for a dessert in minutes.’

The device, which costs £29.99, comes with 20 recipe suggestions.
