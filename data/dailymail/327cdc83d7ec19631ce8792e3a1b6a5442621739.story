Sir Alex Ferguson's claim that he brought flop Bebe to Manchester United on the recommendation of Carlos Queiroz is false, insists his former assistant manager.

Ferguson signed the forward in a £7.4million deal in August 2010 from Vitoria Guimaraes, a price tag considered exorbitant by many given his career to that point included a single season in Portugal's fourth tier.

Ferguson has said Bebe was the first player he had brought to Old Trafford who he hadn't seen in action personally, crediting Queiroz for convincing him to make the signing.

Bebe played just two league games at United and didn't start once before moving to Benfica

'Bebe was not even part of our scouting files for the national team of Portugal,' said Queiroz, who in 2010 was the manager of his home national team.

'He didn't exist in a system where nothing escaped us.

'So Bebe going to Man United took me by surprise.

'I called my coaches and asked them what was going on, why he didn't exist.'

The transfer has been subject of a corruption investigation by Portugal police into why the Premier League giants would pay so much for a lower league player.

Bebe is widely regarded among the most disappointing signings of Ferguson's illustrous 26-year reign at United.

Bebe played jut twice in the league for the Red Devils before moving to Portugal's Benfica in the summer in a £2m deal.

Before that he'd spent time on loan with Besiktas, Rio Ave and Pacos de Ferreira.

Bebe came to United having not even appeared for Guimaraes - the winger, soon after signing with agent Jorge Mendes, was picked up by United just weeks after a free transfer from Estrela after the third division club didn't pay his wages. 

Mendes is noted for taking Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani and Anderson to United, and reportedly earned £2.89m in the Bebe deal.

Although a player United fans - and Ferguson - would prefer to forget, Bebe has impressed at Benfica with his manager Jorge Jesus saying last month that he could make a stunning return to England ad even the Premier League.

Jesus told Record: 'Tiago (Bebe) never experienced youth development. He was introduced to football late and he lost a lot of time in England.

'Tiago's development will be equal to Talisca's, Matic's and Andre Gomes. They were all late bloomers.'
