Matthew Gibson could have easily gotten away with murder - but then Walmart intervened. 

Gibson, apparently racked with guilt, drove across the country to confess bludgeoning to death Barbara Leone Brown with a flashlight more than 15 years ago after getting some cryptic messages from the big-box retailer.

The 55-year-old man was sentenced to 10 years in prison after driving from North Carolina to Arizona to turn himself in to face charges that a prosecutor said wouldn't have come without the 55-year-old's surrender. 

Unclean conscience: Matthew Gibson, 55, raced 1,800 across the US to confess to the 1997 murder of Barbara Leone Brown after receiving messages from Walmart about a woman's prescription 

'His name was never in any report. We didn't even know he existed,' Mohave County assistant prosecutor Jace Zack said Tuesday. 

'I am 100 per cent certain that he would not have been caught if he didn't turn himself in,' he said.

The 1997 death of Barbara Leone Brown, from Arizona, in the Colorado River town of Bullhead City in western Arizona has agonized Gibson, who has found religion, his attorney Ron Gilleo said.

'He just wanted it off his chest,' Gilleo said.

Gibson, a former cocaine and meth addict, provided a written statement to authorities last month. 

'Only the good Lord knows what that night was all about, but I'm deeply sorry for that night,' he wrote. 'For years now, I have weeped (sic) over this and it has been heavy on my soul.'

His lawyer said the feeling propelled Gibson to drive about 1,800 miles this summer from Vilas, North Carolina, to Winslow, Arizona, where he went to police.

But detective Alicia Marquez, with the Winslow Police Department, told the Charlotte Observer that Gibson grew paranoid that someone had found out about the murder.

The man grew suspicious after he began receiving text messages and voice mails from Walmart telling him that Anita Townsend’s prescription was ready for pickup.

Gibson did not know the name of the woman he killed, so he concluded that Anita Townsend must have been the victim, and that someone was playing games with him.

When he was sent an envelope containing an ad from Walmart but no return label, he came to believe that someone has put ‘a contract on his head.’

Last June, Gibson got behind the wheel of his car in North Carolina and raced across the country without rest until he arrived at the Winslow Police Department, where he finally came clean about the crime.

Brown's body was found years ago in thick bushes along the river. She had multiple skull fractures. Her husband had reported her missing several days earlier.

Gibson provided information that fit Brown's death, according to Bullhead City police. Authorities said he told them he and the 38-year-old woman had argued because she refused to leave his home, that he hit her with a flashlight and dumped her body after she died from the injury.

The two weren't romantically involved, Zack said.

Mohave County Superior Court judge Rick Williams sentenced Gibson on Friday.

Gibson surrendered in June to police in Winslow, about 200 miles east of Kingman, where the woman lived.
