It is a reputation perhaps best captured by Robert De Niro's immortal line 'You talkin' to me?' in 1976 movie Taxi Driver.

Looking into the mirror, his character, Travis Bickle, imagines a confrontation he hopes will lead to him drawing his gun in a scene that has come to symbolise the unfriendly nature of New York.

Now that unenviable accolade has been reinforced after the city was voted America's rudest in a recent poll.

Not the spirit: Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, whose famous line 'You talkin' to me?' has come to symbolise unfriendliness in New York

New York, which previously won the gong in 2009, has reclaimed the title from Los Angeles after readers of Travel & Leisure magazine were asked to vote on their least-favourite cities.

Following up were Miami in second place, Washington, DC, and three-time champ and road-rage capital LA.

According to Diane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert and owner of Protocol Etiquette School of Texas, said the clear trend was the bigger the city, the bigger the attitude.

'People in big cities tend to be very 
direct, she told Travel & Leisure magazine. 'While that can be fine.
 It's no excuse for being rude.'

But
 some say New Yorkers may just be misunderstood. With eight million 
people all in a hurry, the perception of rudeness may just be a 
byproduct of a bustling metropolis.

'People
 in New York are constantly in a rush,' said Big Apple manners expert 
Thomas Farley, who writes the blog What Manners Most.

'Certainly, they don’t linger on corners smiling, waving, and waiting to help people. But once you’ve stopped a New Yorker and asked them for directions, they’re usually more than helpful.'

The award was determined as part of magazine's America’s Favorite Cities survey, in which readers rank 35 major cities based on categories such as best pizza, the most pedestrian-friendly streets and the most reliable wireless coverage.

Smaller, slower-paced southern cities like New Orleans and Charleston made the top five of a list of friendly cities.
