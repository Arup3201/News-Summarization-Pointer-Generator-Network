Ravaged: Ninety condos on the beach in Westhampton were obliterated by flames on Wednesday afternoon

Intense: Smoke poured toward the ocean and could be seen from three miles away as 12 fire crews tried to control the flames

Before: This is what the pristine complex looked like before the fire. It is used as a holiday home by residents between May and November

Twelve fire teams were deployed in a bid to control the flames but could not get inside any of the summer homes. Nobody was hurt.

Janice Sklarek, who owns one of the apartments in the Sandpiper complex which is open between May and November, told NBC: 'We saw the big black smoke coming off the ocean and couldn't get down here fast enough.

'Flames were coming out of every window.

'This is something that you think happen to other people, but when it happens to yourself, it's just unbelievable.'

'Lost everything': The building manager who lived and worked in the Sandpiper complex was distraught watching the fire

Best efforts: Firefighters used cranes to approach the fire which was so strong they couldn't get inside the building

Intense: Residents said the fire, whic is being investigated, was so intense it melted the paint off buildings nearby

Her partner, building manager Rob Taber who lived and worked in the building, said he has lost everything.

A witness, Dave Rose, told ABC 7: 'You could see flames from about three miles away and you still saw all the flames going up.' 

Westhampton fire chief Ross Donneson told NBC: 'Luckily the wind was offshore, so we had good visibility of the front of the structure and we set up our apparatus to combat the fire.'

He told ABC 7 they are investigating claims the fire started near a car parked by the complex.
