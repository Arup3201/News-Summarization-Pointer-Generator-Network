Links being forwarded via Twitter actually make people's PCs part of Anonymous's 'denial of service' attacks against U.S. government sites and anti-piracy organisations

Hacker group Anonymous have become a cult hit on Twitter, with 249,000 followers - but security experts Sophos warn that fans, are being tricked into taking part in its attacks.

Links being forwarded via Twitter actually make people's PCs part of Anonymous's 'denial of service' attacks against U.S. government sites and anti-piracy organisations.

The links are being forwarded as part of Anonymous's recent 'Operation Megaupload' - a retaliation for the U.S. government 'taking down' a file-sharing site.

They look like ordinary web links, but launch cyber attacks from whatever PC you access them on.

People who click the links unwittingly become part of Anonymous's attacks - and hit any website that the 'hacktivist' group chooses.

It's a change of tactics for Anonymous - and security experts warn that claiming you clicked on a link by accident may not be a defense.

The attacks, a 'denial of service' attack, rely on thousands of PCs sending information to sites at once to crash them.

'In the past, Anonymous has 
encouraged supporters to install a program called LOIC, which allows 
computers to join in an attack on a particular website, blasting it with
 unwanted traffic,' said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at 
Sophos.

'This change in tactic from Anonymous, which allows attacks to 
be launched by simply clicking on a link, means that internet users need
 to be extremely careful when clicking on unknown URLs or they could 
unwittingly be joining this latest zombie army.'

'Don't forget, 
denial-of-service-attacks are illegal," Cluley continued. 

'If you 
participate in such an attack, you could find yourself receiving a 
lengthy jail sentence. 

'I'm not sure if participants in this instance 
would get away with claiming that they innocently clicked on links by 
mistake, so make sure you always trust the links you click on, even if 
they're shared by a friend on social networking sites.'

One of Anonymous's messages says, 'We Anonymous are launching our 
largest attack ever on government and music industry sites.  Lulz.  The 
FBI didn't think they would get away with this did they?  They should 
have expected us.'These attacks follow on from this week's 
internet blackout, where thousands of sites participated in protest 
against proposed US anti-piracy legislation.

File-sharing website Megaupload was shut down yesterday, and its 
founders arrested.
