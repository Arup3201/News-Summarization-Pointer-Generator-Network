The report found that one in five workers, who took part in the research check their work emails more than ten times a day outside office hours

One in two managers do so much over-time in the office, typically unpaid, that it adds up to ‘at least’ one extra day per week, a survey revealed today. 

The report, from the Institute of Leadership and Management, lays bare the devastating impact on workers’ lives of Britain’s tradition of gruellingly long hours.

When asked about their working week, 47 per cent said they do ‘at least one additional day of 7.5 hours’ per week and 13 per cent doing over 15 hours extra per week.

Just one in eight workers said they feel they have ‘a good work/life balance’, with many complaining of rarely seeing their children, socialising with friends or enjoying their hobbies.

Nearly 90 per cent of workers, who took part in the research, said they ‘regularly’ check their emails at night or over the weekends.

One in five said they typically check their work emails ‘more than ten times per day outside of office hours.’

Charles Elvin, chief executive of the ILM, which did the research, said many workers are so addicted to their mobile phones that it leads to ‘some rather unhealthy behaviour.’

He said: ‘Smartphones are a fantastic enabler of flexible working, but we see here that they can also lead to some rather unhealthy behaviours.

‘These include the obsessive checking and sending of out-of-hour emails.

‘We all know how stressful it can be to receive an urgent late night email when you feel compelled to respond immediately.’

The poll, based on the views of 1,000 members of the ILM who are all managers, both junior and senior, revealed how people’s working lives dominate their day-to-day existence.

Eight in ten ‘routinely’ work late in the office or at home, half ‘regularly work through their lunch break’ and over a third work over the weekend.

Mr Elvin said: ‘When you add up all the skipped lunch breaks, early morning conference calls and after hours emails, you see just how widespread the extra hours culture is within UK business.’

Half of business managers say they regularly work through their lunch break and over a third say they work over the weekends

Yesterday Professor Cary Cooper, from Lancaster University Management School, said technology, such as mobile phones which also have an email facility, are ‘a curse’ in many ways.

He said: ‘Technology means that people are so over-loaded electronically with emails and everything else. They are accessible seven days a week, 24 hours a day.’

Professor Cooper said millions of people work during their holidays, over their lunch breaks and on the train while they commute into the office.

He said: ‘The hours that people are putting into work are astronomical.’

Mr Elvin added: ‘Excessive hours are not sustainable. There are only so many times you can burn the midnight oil before your performance, decision-making and well-begin begin to suffer.’

The Trades Union Congress said recently it calculates around 5.4million workers put in an estimated £640million of unpaid over-time every week.

A typical worker does 7 hours and 48 minutes of unpaid over-time every week, it said.
