Doctors are seeing up to 116,000 bogus whiplash patients every month, a report by insurers reveals today.

Nearly a million hours of GPs’ time is wasted annually by the 1.4million suspected fraudsters, says research by LV=.

And as well as putting a strain on the already creaking NHS, false whiplash claims cost insurers over £2billion a year – adding an average of £90 to drivers’ premiums, according to the Association of British Insurers.

The report found that Britain’s reputation as the ‘whiplash capital of the world’ is justified – 78 per cent of UK car accidents, in which one driver accepts liability, involves a compensation claim for whiplash. This is twice the Western European average.

Doctors also remarked that the problem is becoming more widespread, with 43 per cent saying they now frequently see suspected feigned injuries, compared with 26 per cent in 2012.

The research concludes: ‘The NHS is being put under increasing strain as more people attempt to claim compensation from exaggerated or invented injuries.

‘It is estimated that doctors are collectively seeing around 116,000 suspect cases a month, which is eating up close to a million surgery hours each year.

‘GPs report that dealing with these types of cases not only takes away valuable appointment time from genuine patients, but that additional surgery hours are lost dealing with the law firms and claims companies pestering them for paperwork.’

Shockingly, more than half – 52 per cent – of doctors said fraudsters have tried to pressure them into agreeing with them on their condition.

The rise in dubious injuries comes despite legislation being introduced in 2013, which gave the courts new powers to throw out claims and banning lawyers from offering incentives.

The report notes: ‘It appears that this has not had a long-term impact. The UK sees more compensation claims for whiplash injuries per car accident than any other Western European country.’

LV= claims director Martin Milliner said: ‘The cost of dealing with fraudulent claims not only pushes up the cost of car insurance for honest motorists but it also hurts the public purse.’
