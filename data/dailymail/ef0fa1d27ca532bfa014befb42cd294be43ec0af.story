Judd Trump staged a remarkable comeback to beat Ronnie O'Sullivan and claim the inaugural Grand Prix title in Llandudno.

O'Sullivan had led 7-4 in their best-of-19 meeting but Trump went on to win the next six frames to claim the crown and the £100,000 prize money.

World No 7 Trump had to overcome a 5-1 deficit to beat Martin Gould in the semi-finals and he once again displayed his ability to stay in contention having slipped to a 4-1 deficit against O'Sullivan.

The duo had already met in this season's Champion of Champions UK Championship finals, with O'Sullivan coming out on top and he looked sharp with a break of 90 to level this meeting at 1-1.

A loose shot from Trump in the fourth frame let in O'Sullivan and he took full advantage - clearing the table after a safety battle, before hitting his maiden century of the tournament as his 105 was enough to move further ahead.

But the five-time world champion began to let errors creep into his game and missed a brown in the sixth frame which allowed Trump to peg him back before winning the next two with breaks of 46 and 50, respectively.

A break of 89 was enough for O'Sullivan to re-establish his lead ahead of the evening session - but it would be Trump celebrating later in the day.

O'Sullivan showed no signs of letting his slender lead slip as he opened the evening session with a break of 96 before a lucky red allowed him another frame-winning break in the 11th to open up a three-frame lead.

Trump came out on top in a scrappy 12th frame before two decent breaks saw him reel iAnd he started strongly after the break, clearing up for 142 - the highest break of the tournament - to level the match and increase the pressure on his opponent.

A mis-cue from O'Sullivan allowed Trump in to take the lead for the first time since the opening frame before the 25-year-old played his way out of a snooker to sink a pot and move to within a frame of the title.

He passed up the chance to clean up after missing a blue whilst on a break of 36 but O'Sullivan could not capitalise and Trump returned to the table to pot a difficult red and add a break of 29 to become the first winner of the Grand Prix.
