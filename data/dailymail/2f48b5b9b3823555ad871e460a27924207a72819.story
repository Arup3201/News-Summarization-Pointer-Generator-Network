David Cameron last night told other EU leaders he was ‘completely unapologetic’ about refusing to back Jean-Claude Juncker for Europe’s top job as it emerged there have been secret talks over the candidate’s drinking and smoking habits.

European diplomats claimed Mr Juncker ‘chain-smoked’ his way through one meeting yesterday and was attempting to have a smoking ban in the European Parliament building in Brussels lifted before he has even been appointed.

But now several EU leaders are understood to have discussed allegations that the former Luxembourg Prime Minister is a heavy drinker during talks on who should become president of the European Commission.

The row over appointing Jean-Claude Juncker to the European Commission Presidency threatens to overshadow events marking 100 years since the start of the Great War

‘Alcohol consumption has been raised by a number of leaders since the [European] Parliament elections [in May],’ said one diplomat.

The row over Europe’s leadership, expected to end in humiliation for Mr Cameron at a Brussels summit today, has plunged Britain’s relationship with the rest of the EU into deep crisis.

Mr Cameron will today warn his EU counterparts that the appointment of Mr Juncker, whom he considers an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform, risks pushing the UK closer to the EU exit door.

He also rejected last-ditch attempts by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to persuade him to cave in and not force the appointment of Mr Juncker to a vote, saying there would be ‘consequences’ if Britain is overruled.

Yesterday he vowed to fight 'until the end' the appointment of a man seen by the UK as a roadblock to reform.

Labour and the Lib Dems have publicly supported the Tories in insisting Mr Juncker is the wrong man for the job. 

Downing Street argues that the decision should have been taken between EU leaders, and not imposed by the EPP – the largest group in the European Parliament.

Mr Cameron is expected to force an unprecedented vote on Mr Juncker’s appointment, leaving other leaders to have to justify their decision.

The row threatens to overshadow a gathering of EU leaders at the highly symbolic venue of Ypres to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War.

After paying respect to the memory of the dead with a minute's silence, Mr Cameron faces an awkward dinner with Mrs Merkel and other leaders with whom he has very publicly rowed.

As the events got underway, Mr Cameron told reporters: ‘'I am completely unapologetic about standing up for an important principle in Europe, which is that the elected heads of government should make these choices,' he said.

'I am also unapologetic about the need for people to carry forward badly-needed reform in Europe and there will be a vote tomorrow and we'll see the outcome of that vote.

‘It's absolutely vital people know that with me you get what I said I'm going to do in Europe.'

The bitter row has exposed the dire relations between London and many other European capitals, with the Tories coming closing to accusing other leaders of lying about their support for Mr Juncker.

In an apparent swipe at some of his fellow leaders, who are reported to have voiced unease with Mr Juncker's candidacy in private talks, Mr Cameron said: 'It's very important in Europe, that you say what you say in private, and it's the same as what you say in public.'

There is growing speculation that Mr Cameron will threaten defeat over the Commission presidency would make a British exit from the EU more likely in the referendum he is planning for 2017.

Mr Cameron added: ‘My message to my fellow heads of government and heads of state is that this approach that they are contemplating taking is the wrong approach for Europe.

'They are about to take what I think is the wrong step. So I will make that argument, I will stick to my guns, I will stick to my principles, I will insist on that vote. We will have to wait and see what actually happens in that vote.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to play down the consequences of a failure to find consensus on the presidency.

'It would not be a drama if we voted with a qualified majority only,' she said.

'But
 - and I have also stressed this again and again before - all 
consultations are carried out within a European spirit and the concerns 
of all member states taken seriously.'

And
 Sweden, which had initially expressed reservations about Mr Juncker's 
candidacy, has now indicated that it will not block his nomination.

Swedish finance minister Anders Borg told the BBC: 'I think it's quite clear that there is an overwhelming support for Jean-Claude Juncker as the head of the Commission.

'It's a key interest for Sweden, but also for Germany and the Netherlands and many other European countries to keep the UK in the European Union, so we could have seen strong arguments for listening to David Cameron when he raised this.

'But now we are in a position where it is quite clear that there is overwhelming support, so we have to accept that.'

Labour said Mr Cameron had mishandled the issue. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 

'Sadly, the handling of these negotiations have turned a Europe divided over Jean-Claude Juncker into a Europe apparently united against David Cameron.'

'My personal judgment is he was too public, too personal in his attacks, too early, with the result that public criticism got confused with private influence,' said Mr Alexander.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has also claimed Mr Cameron's robust opposition to Mr Juncker becoming president of the European Commission 'has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe'.

Meanwhile, The Prime Minister believes he can ‘dodge’ holding an in/out EU referendum in 2017, a senior Tory warned last night. Dominic Cummings, former aide to Education Secretary Michael Gove, said: ‘Cameron’s inner circle thinks he can still dodge the bullet of a referendum, though if he tries his party may send in a firing squad.’
