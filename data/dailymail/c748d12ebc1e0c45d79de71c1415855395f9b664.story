A locked-in syndrome patient has been captured on film tweeting for the first time.

Tony Nicklinson, who was left completely paralysed after a major stroke, is using special eye movement technology to access the social networking site.

He wrote the message: 'Hello world. I am tony nicklinson, I have locked-in syndrome and this is my first ever tweet.'

Mr Nickilson can only communicate by using a computer that follows his eye movements

Mr Nicklinson writes his first tweet on 13 June

In a follow-up message sent the next day he wrote: 'I have just had an old school friend call in for a chat with us but mostly Jane because she can speak. Still, it was nice to see him.'

He had gained 2,600 followers just 24 hours after he joined the website as @TonyNicklinson.

Mr Nicklinson, 57, can only communicate by using a computer that follows his eye movements. Software converts his eye movement into the letters of the alphabet and in turn into words and speech.

Channel 4's Dispatches captured the moment ahead of a programme about Mr Nicklinson's life.

On Tuesday, Mr Nicklinson and his family, who live in Melksham, Wiltshire, will go to the High Court to argue that a doctor should be allowed lawfully to end his life. His case will be heard by three judges.

Mr Nicklinson sums up his life as 'dull, miserable, demeaning, undignified and intolerable'. He requires round the clock care and described his house as a 'prison'.

Mr Nicklinson was described as 'very active' before his stroke

Mr Nicklinson said his life was undignified

In the proceedings, Mr Nicklinson, who suffered a stroke in 2005 while on a business trip to Athens, is asking the High Court to grant declarations that a doctor could intervene to end his 'indignity', with his consent and with him making the decision with full mental capacity, and have a 'common law defence of necessity' against any murder charge.

Before the stroke Mr Nicklinson, who has two grown-up daughters, was a 'very active and outgoing man'.

The 6ft4" father was a keen rugby player who loved extreme sports and regularly travelled abroad for work.

A Channel 4 Dispatches documentary about Tony Nicklinson's life will broadcast on Monday 18th June at 8pm
