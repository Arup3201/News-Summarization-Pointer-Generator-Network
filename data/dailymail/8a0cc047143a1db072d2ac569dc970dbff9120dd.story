Some people will do anything to find love and one waiter did, resorting to a very odd and romantic but yet cheesy way.

A waiter at a pizza restaurant in Auckland called Il Buco Pizza Parlour on Vulcan Lane, wrote an endearing message on the inside of a pizza box and posted it on facebook.

Rupert Bear told The New Zealand Herald he was dumbstruck by the good looks of a customer who stopped in for a latte and a slice of pizza on September 3.

The 25 year old's willingness to hunt down love then prompted him to post a photo of himself on facebook holding up a pizza box with a written message on it, which has now gone viral on social media and gay websites.

'Three Weeks ago I served you pizza and a coffee and I told you your shoelace was undone. I've been waiting for you to come back! If you're still in Auckland find me on Facebook: Rupert Bear. I'd really like to see you again. p.s. I'm not usually this dorky. P.P.S. if you're not the guy, please share. THX.' the message wrote.

And the romantic gesture didn't go un-noticed, it got plenty of love, with thousands of people sharing his plea and wishing him all the best to find his guy.

Pizza and love, what two better things : Waiter Rupert Bear posted a special message on the inside of a pizza box trying to track down a customer who had come into his work and then posted it on facebook

Two days after the post, Mr Bear again posted a message on facebook thanking everyone for their kind support.

'Wow!! I'm totally blown away but all of your kind messages and support. I still haven't tracked down my man yet, so keep at it,' he said. 

The mystery man has been described as fit-looking, in his 30s with dark hair, a bit of a beard, piercing blue eyes, possibly with an American accent, 'and obviously very handsome,' according to Mr Bear.

'I told him his shoe was undone and he said thanks, and that was it,' he told the New Zealand Herald.

And he has been clearly stunned by all the attention that his very daring but romantic post has received.

'Overnight I had all these shares. I've had so many messages of support from all these people, it's humbling, I didn't expect it.'
