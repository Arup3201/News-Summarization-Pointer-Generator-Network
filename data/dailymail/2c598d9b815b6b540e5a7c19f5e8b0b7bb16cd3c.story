Dirty teacher: Martina Stanley, pictured, was sentenced Monday to 15 days' jail for having sex with a 17-year-old boy at her school

An Ohio sports coach and mother-of-four has been sentenced to 15 days' jail for having sex with a 17-year-old boy at her school.

Martina Stanley, 35, admitted having an affair with the teen while she was coaching cross country and track at Elgin High School in Marion County.

The defense argued the boy, who attended the school but wasn't a student of Stanley's, initiated the sex and wasn't harmed.

In a sentencing memorandum, defense attorney Todd Anderson said the teen bragged about the sex to friends.

'The victim joked about the incident when interviewed...and stated he "was fine" and "she is every school boy's dream,"' Anderson said according to 10tv.com.

'This is not to shift blame, but he was very aggressively pursuing Mrs Stanley to escalate the relationship.'

But in court Monday, Stanley apologized to her victim and claimed responsibility for her actions.

'I'd like to say with all of my heart and as humble as I possibly can, that I'm sorry,' she said.Â 

'I take this very seriously. This has been the hardest part of my life I've had to deal with because it rests on my shoulders, and I accept that.'

Stanley was first charged with sexual battery. However, she pleaded guilty to a lesser felony of attempted gross sexual imposition.

She was sentenced to 15 days in jail and one year's probation.

She will also have to register as a sex offender and was ordered not to have unsupervised contact with any underage boys.

Anderson had argued that Stanley's charge should be a misdemeanor rather than a felony because she knew the boy as a neighbor and not as a student.

However, the judge decided she had still taken advantage of the teen.
