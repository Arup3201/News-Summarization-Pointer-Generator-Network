Didier Drogba insists that Chelsea want to achieve 'something great' this season - by claiming multiple trophies, including the FA Cup.

The Blues begin their FA Cup campaign on Sunday when they host Championship side Watford in the third round.

And it is one of four trophies they could still claim this campaign, with Chelsea having reached the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup, the last 16 of the Champions League and they also lead the Premier League alongside Manchester City.

But Drogba is determined to ensure it is a season to remember at Stamford Bridge.

He told Chelsea TV: 'We have to do it (win something) together.

'We want to achieve something great and I think that is why we have played well this season. I hope at the end of it we will be able to say together we won this trophy, this trophy and this trophy.

'And yes, I would love to win another FA Cup. I would love to win it for the club and for the fans as well. I know the feeling the fans have when we get to a final. We share the same feeling.

'It would be nice to go back to Wembley together again and make history.'

A 5-3 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day has allowed Man City to join the Blues at the summit of the Premier League.

So Drogba and Chelsea are determined to get back to winning ways - first against Watford in the Cup and then against Newcastle United next Saturday in the Premier League.

The 36-year-old continued: 'The mentality is always to get closer to Wembley. You win this round; you go to the next one.

'If you have to replay a game you do it but really the thing is to get to Wembley because it's a fantastic stadium and the FA Cup is only good when you win it.

'If you get to the final that's when you really know you have a chance to win the trophy because when you come in you see the cup. Everything changes.

'We always play to win. The more you win this competition the more you are connected to it. I think it's been two-and-a-half years since we won it last so it would be good for us to go to Wembley again and win it but it's a long journey ahead.' 

Jose Mourinho is determined to secure silverware this season having failed to pick up a single trophy in his first campaign back at Stamford Bridge last year.

And former Marseille, Shanghai Shenhua and Galatasaray striker Drogba is determined that the 'big competition' that is the FA Cup be one of them.

The ex-Ivory Coast international added: 'Even when I was in France it was a big competition.

'We all watched the FA Cup final as though it was the last game of the season. I used to see players that I was and still am a big fan of playing and scoring in these finals, people like Cantona and Anelka.

'It's a great competition for English football, one where you can find a team from a lower division or a team that is struggling in the league in the semi-final or the final. The atmosphere for the games, with all the fans travelling to support their teams, is special.

'When I think of the FA Cup I have these images of (Roberto) di Matteo, (Eric) Cantona, (Nicolas) Anelka scoring in the final at the old Wembley. I always dreamed of playing at the old Wembley but I didn't have the chance because they built the new one.

'I was lucky then to create some kind of history at the new stadium (with Chelsea).'
