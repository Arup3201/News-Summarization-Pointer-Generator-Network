Sir Alex Ferguson has recalled the awkward moment Eric Cantona turned up to a civic reception wearing an American Indian jacket.

The former Manchester United manager laughed as he remembered the quirky Frenchman on BT Sport's Clare Balding Meets. 

Ferguson said of the Frenchman: 'He was different. I remember when we went to a civic reception and Cantona came walking in with this (American) Indian jacket on, everybody's head in the room turned to me and I sort of turned my head away as if I hadn’t seen him. And I’m saying: "Jesus, god."

Cantona remains a firm fan's favourite at United having spent five season at Old Trafford during the nineties

Ferguson laughed as he remembered the quirky Frenchman on BT Sport's 'Claire Balding meets'.

'The frills round the side and the big Indian (symbol). The players were all focusing on me and wondering what I was going to say. 

'The next morning I mentioned it to Eric. He said: "I don’t know, I thought it was casual," and I said: "well, that is some casual gear that".'

United's former No 7 remains a fan favourite, with supporters calling him 'King Eric' during his five year spell at Old Trafford.
