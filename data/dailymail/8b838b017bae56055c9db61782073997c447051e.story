It was Henry Cooper's manager who said that in Germany, 'You've got to knock them out to get a draw'.

Almost 60 years since Our 'Enery was controversially disqualified in Frankfurt, Paul Smith became the latest Brit to fall foul of scandalous judging.

The Liverpool super-middleweight pushed world champion Arthur Abraham to the brink in Kiel only to be left 'disgusted' by the scorecards.

After a nip and tuck fight that swung first to the champion and then to the challenger, the result appeared to be on a knife edge.

But the ringside judges disagreed with two awarding Abraham the fight by six rounds while the other, disgracefully, gave Smith just one of the sessions.

Visibly distraught, the 31-year-old said: 'What can you do? It's disgusting. It's the main thing I hate about boxing. Most of them [the judges] have never fought and they're robbing kids of life-changing opportunities.

'I proved I'm not British level. I did some things wrong but I did a lot of it right. I was outworking him every round. I was shading a lot of the rounds. It's Germany, I well and truly got my fingers burnt.

Abraham is likely to chase a lucrative domestic fight against the winner from Robert Stieglitz or Felix Stur

'I believe I did enough. At the end of the rounds I didn't think I was losing many of them.' Smith's promoter Eddie Hearn echoed his fighter's frustrations.

He said: 'The sickening thing is the scores. These people can't be judging fights; they are not good enough. I can't help but laugh, how can you score that fight 11-1?

'The score cards go down in history but they won't reflect the fight. Paul has worked all his life for this opportunity and just wanted a fair crack at the whip.'

Smith demanded an immediate rematch but that looks unlikely as Abraham chases a money-spinning domestic dust-up against old foe Robert Stieglitz or Felix Sturm who meet in November.

Ironically, the latter is no stranger to claims of robbery from British fighters.

Both Matthew Macklin and Martin Murray challenged the former middleweight world champion in 2011 but left empty handed after a split-decision loss and a draw respectively.

Abraham admitted: 'Of course I would fight Paul again. I'm sure it would be another exciting fight. However the circumstances would need to be right. At the moment the most interesting fight for me would be Sturm or Stieglitz.'

Smith, who remains the British champion, was philosophical on the morning after the night before.

He tweeted: 'Listen I'm alive, I'm healthy and I've got an amazing family. Life's a bigger game than boxing. I've always said that. I'll be back!'
