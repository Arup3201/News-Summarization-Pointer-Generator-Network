To you, it might just look like a white hat. But to Academy Award winner Russell Crowe, it's much, much more than that. 

The Gladiator star penned a bizarre, 12-part tribute to a white fedora on his Twitter account at the weekend.

Crowe spotted the 'jaunty, white' hat being kicked along the ground 'just before dawn' from a vantage point at his accommodation in Madrid on Saturday.

The violence of the act spurred on a series of ponderous, even existential, thoughts.

This 'jaunty white fedora' provoked a stream of insights from the Gladiator and Water Diviner star

'I pondered the mystery and the endless potential causes,' tweeted Crowe. 

'What brings a man to kick his jaunty white fedora with a black band down a street in Madrid just after dawn? 

'What brings a man to that? 

Over the course of more than an hour, the South Sydney Rabbitohs owner pondered that the headwear had gone through some tough times. He described it as 'roughened' and 'rejected'.

He eventually collected the hat from the ground, but pledged not to wear it as he is 'superstitious'. 

'I will dust it off and leave it in this suite. 

'Come summer ,on a sweltering day, perhaps it will become some hatless persons lucky hat.

'THE END'.
