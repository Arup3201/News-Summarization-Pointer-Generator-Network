Muslims and other ethnic minorities living in Britain should embrace our way of life and celebrate Christmas in traditional style, with carols and Santa, according  to a Cabinet Minister.

Baroness Warsi, Minister for Faith and Communities, says immigrant families must do more to become fully integrated and wants to introduce measures to force them to speak English.

She also says it is wrong to excuse drug-taking by ethnic minorities through fear of being branded racist. 

Controversial: Faith and Communities Minister Baroness Warsi says immigrant families must do more to embrace the British way of life

And, most controversially, she says immigrant families should enjoy a traditional Christian Christmas, complete with Nativity plays and Christmas cards.

Baroness Warsi, a practising Muslim, told The Mail on Sunday it was time to tackle ‘politically correct’ attitudes.

She said that if immigrant families were given more help to learn English and told in blunt terms ‘now, join in’, it would improve race relations and unlock the estimated £8 billion earning potential  of talented, non-English-speaking ethnic minorities.

Baroness Warsi said English people were partly to blame due to their ‘watering down’ of traditions such as Christmas, for example by replacing ‘Merry Christmas’ on cards with the non-religious ‘Season’s greetings’.

She said if English people showed more self-confidence, immigrant families would copy them.

She added: ‘The number  of Asians who wear kilts at their wedding in Scotland is amazing.

'Because the Scottish identity is much more assertive than the weaker English identity, minority communities are more embracing of it.’

Integration: Baroness Warsi said immigrant families should enjoy a traditional Christian Christmas - from carols to nativity plays

The peer, who is to make  a speech on integration tomorrow, said the use of teaching assistants who act as translators in classrooms was ‘holding children back’.

Similarly, multi-lingual forms in hospitals and other public services should be phased out, Baroness Warsi said.

She also urged Home Secretary Theresa May to ban khat, a legal plant-based drug blamed for causing criminal behaviour.

Baroness Warsi, who is also a Foreign Office Minister, claimed the reason  it had not been outlawed was because it was used mainly by Somalis and Ethiopians.
