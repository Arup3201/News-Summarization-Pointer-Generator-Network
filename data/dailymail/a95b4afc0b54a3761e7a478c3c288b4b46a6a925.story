A dog owner was jailed for four months today after a six-year-old schoolboy was brutally savaged by his pet called Tyson.

Erfan Ali was scarred for life when the Rhodesian Ridgeback - bred to hunt lions - pounced from over the next door neighbour’s fence as he was helping his mother bring in washing from the garden.

He had both sides of his face ripped off by the dog and only survived because the dog was eventually wrestled off.

Owner Kevin Large, 27, admitted failing to control 18-month-old Tyson who has since been destroyed.

Prosecutor Huw Evans said: 'Erfan had been in the garden with his mother playing in the washing basket when the dog grabbed his right hand.

'The child was screaming and Mrs Ali was desperately trying to get the dog off her son whilst at the same time retreating to the kitchen’s open door.

'By holding on to Erfan and trying to grapple with the dog she was able to get the dog off his arm and get him into the house.

'She couldn’t close the door quickly enough and Tyson followed them - that’s when it decided to go for the child’s face.'

Primary school pupil Erfan was attacked when Large’s 18-month-old dog entered the family’s garden through a hole in the fence.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how the family were all scared of the dog and had asked Large repeatedly to secure the fence.

But his botched job of holding it in place with rope and nails was unable to contain the large dog who attacked Erfan at his home in the Gabalfa area of Cardiff.

After the attack Erfan was rushed from his home to a specialist Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery in Morriston, Swansea.

He needed stitches to his hand, knee, lip, eyebrow and required skin grafts and around 170 stitches to repair wounds on both cheeks.

He will require surgery throughout his life to correct the scaring caused by the attack.

Large later took the dog back to his home and put him in a cage, the police were then called to the scene and the dog was destroyed.

He pleaded guilty to allowing a dog to enter a place where it injured a person, an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.

Matthew Cobbe, defense, said: 'The incident is awful and by Large’s own admission he has been suffering from nightmares about it.

'He has attended court with remorse and is very sorry for the injuries.'

Judge Nicholas Jones sentenced Large to four months in prison and banned him from keeping dogs for 10 years.

He said: said: 'This offending is so 
serious immediate custody is necessary. Persons who own dogs like this 
must understand they are dangerous and must understand if they are 
allowed to go and cause serious injury the courts will pass an immediate
prison sentence.'

Rhodesian Ridgebacks are a South African breed of dog known for their bravery.

Male dogs are often more than 70 cm tall and weigh around 85lb.

They are also known as African Lion Hounds as they have been used to hunt lions.

They are not banned in the UK.

They are said to be calm, gentle and obedient but can become highly strung if they do not get enough exercise

Speaking after the sentencing, Erfan Ali’s parents called for laws governing the ownership of dangerous dogs to be tightened.

Dilwar and Monowara Ali said: 'This attack has left our brave little son physically and mentally scarred.

'Despite
brilliant work by the specialist NHS team he will still have to undergo
repeat surgical procedures well into his teens and ultimately will be 
left with significant facial scarring for the rest of his life.

'In this case, the dog attacked our son in our own back garden and forced its way into our house when our son fled inside.

'The attack happened when our son was in his own home - the place where he should feel at his safest.

'This has had a catastrophic effect on his sense of security and that of our family.

'We
all hope that the conclusion of the case will allow us to move forward 
and start pushing this traumatic experience behind us.

'We
are aware how near our son came to being killed and that we are lucky 
in the sense that other parents have lost children in dangerous dog 
attacks.'
