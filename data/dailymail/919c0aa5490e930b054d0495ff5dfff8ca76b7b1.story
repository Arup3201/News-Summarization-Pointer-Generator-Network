It’s the one time every year when many people don’t mind spending big on flowers to ensure their mother has a smile on her face.

But, for the second year in a row, hundreds of Interflora customers have been left angry with the service offered on Mother's Day after their flowers arrived damaged - or were never delivered at all.

Customers yesterday reported problems such as deliveries in plastic pots clearly marked 'for transit purposes only' and cards telling the recipient that the gift was half-price.

'Awful': Mother-of-two Vicky Ross was left 'disgusted' after paying £38 for a bouquet of flowers that she 'wouldn't even pay a fiver for'

'Plastic pot for transit purposes only': Matt Grills, 39, paid £40 for what he described as 'the worst excuse for a bouquet delivered I have ever seen' - which even came with a card saying he had received 50 per cent off

Other problems reported to Interflora 
customer services on Twitter included crushed cardboard boxes, flowers 
dead on arrival - and products not matching the description offered 
online.

Nic Ferrier, 43,
 of Tonbridge, Kent, said: 'Interflora just told me they're not going to
 deliver my order tomorrow. I can have 10 per cent off next time though!
 There won't be a next time.’

And
 Charlotte Chadderton, 25, of Flixton, Greater Manchester, said: 'Just 
received my Mother's Day flowers from Interflora - what a disgrace for 
£39.99 - dead and wrapping soaked #nothappy. Thanks!'

Meanwhile Matt Grills, 39, took delivery of a £40 bouquet which was crushed and lopsided, still in its transportation holder - and had a card to the recipient saying 'offer 50 per cent'.

He told the company on Twitter: ‘Absolutely disgusting service along with the worst excuse for a bouquet delivered I have ever seen - get your act sorted.’

'Awful arrangement': Laura Harwood of London said she was 'not impressed' with her Mother's Day flowers

'Absolutely appalled': Nicola Barker from Essex said she received Mother's Day flowers - but they were in a smashed vase, and one of them 'has what looks like mould on it'

Fielding complaints: Customers today reported problems such as deliveries in plastic pots clearly marked 'for transit purposes only' and cards telling the recipient that the gift was half-price

Mr Grills added: ‘Flowers are emotive 
and for emotional times. How dare you run your company disrespecting 
people so badly. You should be ashamed.’

And Twitter user David @sleepydave01 
said: 'So what's the plan Interflora? Are Saturday's orders being 
delivered on Sunday? Or are you looking at a large refund bill?'

He
 added: 'My order never got delivered yesterday, no one has communicated
 anything, and now online it says my order cannot be found.'

Warren Dobson said his girlfriend had been left 'inconsolable' after Interflora failed to deliver a £120 bouquet of flowers she had ordered for her mother last Tuesday.

He added, in a tweet to the company: 'You did however manage to spam her email last night saying you were still taking Mother's Day orders.'

Unhappy: Some customers were left annoyed after the flowers they had ordered failed to materialise

Exchange: Interflora had a lengthy conversation with Matt Grills, who took delivery of a bouquet which was crushed and lopsided, still in its transportation holder - and had a card to the recipient saying 'offer 50 per cent'

The company responded to dozens of angry 
tweets at the weekend, but one customer said in response: ‘An apology 
isn't enough for my 74-year-old gran who has no other family to buy for 
her.’

Last year, the firm was forced to apologise more than 100 times to customers who had order issues, with some left in tears. Bizarrely, one mother found her flowers decked with black funeral ribbons.

A spokesman for the company based in 
Sleaford, Lincolnshire, told MailOnline yesterday: ‘At Interflora, we in 
conjunction with our network of florists deliver hundreds of thousands 
of beautiful bouquets over the Mother’s Day weekend to the delight of 
our customers.  

‘As one of our biggest delivery times of 
the year, we have seen some queries regarding orders.  While it is a 
small number of the overall volume of orders, we do take each and every 
enquiry very seriously. 

Head office: Interflora - whose headquarters in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, are pictured - said in a statement that it apologises to the customers affected, 'and will ensure that all queries are resolved as soon as possible'

Unhappy customers: The Lincolnshire-based firm responded to dozens of angry tweets today and yesterday

‘We have a very dedicated and 
hard-working customer support team who are working with our customers to
 put things right, according to our Interflora Promise.

'We apologise to the customers affected and will ensure that all queries are resolved as soon as possible'

Interflora spokesman

'We apologise to the customers affected and will ensure that all queries are resolved as soon as possible.’

A report released two weeks ago by gardening experts at consumer
organisation Which? found the worst flowers for Mother’s Day come from
Interflora.

Its £32.98 bouquet described as Scented Spring Perfect Gift
scored lowest among the judges. The main criticisms were the poor condition of
its hyacinths and 'gappy' presentation.
