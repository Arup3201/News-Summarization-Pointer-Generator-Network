Police are investigating an incident in which an Adelaide high school student was allegedly tied to a tree and sexually assaulted by a group of boys on school grounds.

The female Year Nine student was allegedly filmed on the perpetrators' mobile phones screaming as eight fellow students pulled down their pants and rubbed their genitalia on her.

The incident occurred in 2011 but it was not reported to the Education Department or South Australian police until April this year, a department spokeswoman said.

The girl's mother told The Advertiser her daughter was taped to a tree and then tied up with a garden hose by another female near the school's staff room before being approached by the other male students.

'My daughter noticed a gang of boys approaching ... she began to ask (the girl) to let her free ... as the boys drew closer they grabbed the hose and sprinkler,' she said.

'By this stage my daughter was screaming and begging (the girl) to untie her; however, the girl chose to laugh at her and do nothing.'

Pictures of the alleged incident were also posted online, further adding to the young girl's humiliation.

The girl's mother said she noticed her daughter become withdrawn, stressed and depressed in 2011 but sessions with teachers and counsellors failed to help.

She added that since the bullies were reported to police this year the girl's Instagram account had been hacked into and the family home and car had been defaced.

The girl has since left the high school.

The principal of the school, which cannot be identified, told Daily Mail Australia he could not comment on the incident as it is being investigated by police.

Senior Constable Mick Abbott said the matter was an ongoing police inquiry and he could not comment.

'It's been ongoing investigation with the Education Department as well,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

An Education Department spokeswoman said the incident was not reported at the time.

'As the matter is now with SA Police, the school has been limited in its involvement,' she said.

'However the school is reviewing its bullying and harassment policies and procedures and has reinforced its practices with staff and students.'

The spokeswoman added that the girl's mother has requested that the Education Department's initial focus be on her daughter's education and wellbeing needs.

'While the student had already left the school concerned when the incident was disclosed, counselling was made available to her from the school's counsellor, and this support continues at her new school,' she said.
