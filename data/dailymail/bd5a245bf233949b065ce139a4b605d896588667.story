Australian tailors have designed a James Bond-style suit that lets you pay for things with the wave of your arm. 

Menswear label M.J. Bale, Heritage Bank and Visa have teamed up to create a suit with a contactless payment chip and antenna woven into the sleeve.

The power suit will let men pay 'invisibly' wherever Visa payWave is accepted.

The contactless technology embedded in the suit is linked to an online Heritage Bank Prepaid account, allowing the wearer to check their balance and top up their suit on-the-go.

M.J. Bale said they are 'giving men the ability to pay for anything with the effortless swagger of a celebrity, tycoon or double agent.'

The company chose Australian Football League star Matthew Rogers to model the suit. The prototype is made from 100 per cent Superfine Australian Merino Wool and has a cut overseen by master Japanese tailor, Kenichi Kaneko.

CEO of M.J. Bale, Matt Jenson, said: 'The world's most powerful men don't carry a wallet. This suit allows you to join their ranks. 

'M.J. Bale has always been a brand for stylish gentlemen, the prototype means the wearer doesn't need to ruin the cut of their trousers or jacket with a bulky wallet. It allows individuals to be ahead of the technology game and look top notch.'

The suit is safe to dry clean and the chip has the same multiple security layers as a traditional contactless card. 

If you happen to lose the jacket, the payment system can be suspended or cancelled straight away via your online Heritage Prepaid account.

Commenting on the technology, CEO of Heritage Bank, John Minz, said: 'People live incredibly fast lives and by combining high-end fashion with cutting edge wearable technology, we are able to offer customers a new level of convenience.'

If you don't want to have to wear a suit to make payments, you could just use your veins instead.

A contactless payment that scans the veins on a shopper's palm is being trialled in Sweden

More than 1,000 Swedish shoppers have signed up to make the payments.

The vein-scanning terminals have been
 installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an engineering student at 
the local university came up with the technology two years ago while 
waiting in line to pay.

Every person's vein pattern is completely unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system, the maker claims.

Handy idea! Developers hope hand scanning will 
become an alternative payment method if it is a success during trials in
 the city of Lund in southern Sweden.

The plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe.
