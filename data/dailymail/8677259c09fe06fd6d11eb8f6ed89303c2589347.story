Mary Helen Rowell clearly doesn't have claustrophobia because her 90-square-foot apartment in Manhattan is enough to make anyone afraid of closed spaces ill. 

The young fashion worker gave Curbed a 'tour' of her apartment to show how she has sacrificed on space to live in the upscale West Village neighborhood, where she can count Courtney Love, Brooke Shields and Calvin Klein as neighbors.

And at just $775 a month in rent - it's a steal by New York standards, where the median rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in her neighborhood is $3,200. 

These pictures, and more on Curbed's site, show just how well Rowell has adapted the space.

A new kind of micro-apartment: New York fashion industry worker Mary Helen Rowell calls this 90-square-foot apartment in the West Village home

Rowell told the site that she first found out about the apartment through NYU's housing listserv. 

While other students scoffed at the comically small space, Rowell saw it as an opportunity to streamline her life. 

'I really like getting rid of things,'  Rowell told Curbed. 'It's my favorite thing.'

It wasn't until she started taking measurements for the apartment that she realized the unique design challenges she was going to face.  

Walk-in closet... of sorts: Rowell has artfully constructed a closet using rails that stick out the wall

Doubling up: The sink is used for cooking but also to clean clothes 

Steal: The small space costs just $750 a month - which is extremely low compared to the $3,200 median rent for the neighborhood 

Neat and tidy: Clever storage solutions help keep Rowell's shoebox orderly, including a pole that hands her kitchen utensils and folding bistro chairs that can be hung up on the wall when not in use 

Close quarters: One of the downsides is the fact that Rowell has to share a bathroom with one of the two other tenants in the building

At just 78-inches wide, the apartment photographed for Curbed by Max Touhey is smaller than a standard bed frame. 

When her initial plans to build a pull-down Murphy bed fell apart, she was forced to build a custom bed-frame which she tricked out with added storage space underneath. 

Prior to moving into the West Village apartment, Rowell lived with roommates. 

Her bedroom has always been small but she had gotten used to having access to a full kitchen a living room.

In her new apartment, there just isn't the space. 

For a kitchen, Rowell has a sink and a sliver of counter space where she can cook on a hot pot. On shelves above that she keeps a toaster oven, microwave, and more storage boxes. 

Rowell says she has been able to feed herself fine in the kitchen, using it to make such elaborate meals as pork chops and baked eggs. 

While she has to use the sink for both cooking and washing up.

The entire building has just three units and only one is a true one bedroom with a bathroom. 

Rowell and another tenant share a bathroom located just across the hall. 

Perhaps the biggest issue in the apartment for Rowell is lack of a closet, since her job in the fashion industry means she has a well-stocked wardrobe. 

Rowell has so many clothes that she can't keep them in the apartment at one time. 

However, she has had luck using the storage company MakeSpace which delivers and picks up boxes at her door for just $25 a month.

For the few clothes she does keep at her apartment, Rowell stores them on three pipe hangers right next to the door. 

To keep her shopping in check, Rowell also has a rule that any time she buys something new, she donates another item.  

Rowell told Curbed: 'My boyfriend tried to give me a book last week, and I said, 'No, there is no place for this.'

Rowell says she's constantly cleaning to keep the place in order and has opted for a more simple design scheme to steer clear of clutter.  

While Rowell loves her apartment, she's planning on moving within the year since she has plans to rent a place with her boyfriend.
