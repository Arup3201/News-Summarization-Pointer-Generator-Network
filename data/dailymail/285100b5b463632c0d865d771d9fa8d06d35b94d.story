After launching its first line of lingerie to rival M&S, now Lidl have declared they are getting into men's pants. 

And to take on rival male underwear ranges fronted by the likes of David Gandy and David Beckham, the bargain supermarket has enlisted a suitably smouldering model to be the face of their campaign.

But instead of the white Y-fronts favoured by other brands, north Londoner Dejan Obradovic, last seen on the catwalk for Emporio Armani during Milan Fashion Week, wears a bright pink pair of Lidl's own brand boxers.

In one promotional image, the young model shows off his toned torso by mimicking fellow model Gandy's favoured pose, and perches casually on an ostentatious sofa in another.     

And from the pictures, shot against the sultry backdrop of Venice, it's hard to believe the boxer-briefs will be available for a mere £3.99.

But it follows a long line of the discount store's luxury-on-the-cheap offerings, which began first with smoked salmon and caviar, followed by champagne and lobster.

They've gone down a storm with the middle class, leading the the German supermarket extended its approach to include clothing.

Lidl's See You In Venice collection is on sale for a fraction of the price women usually pay for lingerie

Recently, the supermarket entered the fashion fray with a range of women's lingerie. 

From the See You in Venice, the supermarket’s first fashion lingerie and jewellery collection, a two-piece bra and knicker set will cost savvy-shoppers just £7.98. 

The lingerie collection, part of the Esmara clothing range, consists of four bra designs in cup sizes 34B, 36B, 38B and 38C. 

The bras are available in polka-dot, slate grey, black trimmed with pink or nude and black, and cost £3.99. 

The matching briefs come in small, medium and large, which covers a generous range of sizes between a ten and 20, and a pack of two costs £3.99 — a fraction of the amount we usually spend on smalls. 

David Beckham set the trend for celebrity underwear ranges with a range of tighty-whiteys for H&M in 2012

Italian fashion label Emporio Armani coaxed ripped DJ Calvin Harris to front their latest underwear campaign

But the trend for cheaper, sexier underwear for men was set by David Beckham, who launched a range of tighty-whiteys for H&M in 2012.

In a series of collaborations with the high street giant that followed, the David Beckham Bodywear collection offered mens underwear for as little as £7.99.

Model David Gandy's efforts led to M&S selling 250,000 pairs from his range last year. 

These day, an increasing number of celebrities have followed in the footsteps of Beckham, including Justin Bieber for Calvin Klein.

And Italian label Emporio Armani recently coaxed DJ Calvin Harris to front their latest underwear campaign.
