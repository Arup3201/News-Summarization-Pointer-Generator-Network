Harry Redknapp junior has followed in his grandfather's footsteps and joined AFC Bournemouth.

The seven-year-old has signed an academy contract with the south coast club and will feature for the Cherries' Under 9's next season.

The starlet is the latest Redknapp to join Bournemouth's academy after his uncle, and former Liverpool and England international midfielder, Jamie rose through their ranks.

Described as "direct, strong and a good little goal scorer," the club's techinical development officer Matty Holmes is excited by the potential of the seven-year-old.

'Harry was playing for Moordown locally so we had an eye on him,' he told Bournemouth's official club website.

'A few scout reports came back saying he was progressing very, very well, so we bought him into our Academy sessions around November last year.

'He's been playing with the top under 8s we've got and he's shown really good progression. He's improved his technical work and his receiving and passing skills have come on no end.

'So with that in mind, and the fact that he comes from a footballing family background, we feel he has a great chance of progressing in our system and that's why we have offered him a contract.'

Current QPR boss Harry Redknapp enjoyed two separate spells with the Cherries as a player and a manager - with the 2-0 FA Cup victory against holders Manchester United in 1984, as Bournemouth boss, still hailed by supporters.
