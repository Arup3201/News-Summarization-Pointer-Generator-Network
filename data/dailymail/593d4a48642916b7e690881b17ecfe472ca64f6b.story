North Korea has angered the south after announcing plans to launch a live-fire drill near the countries' disputed western sea boundary.

Kim Min-seok, South Korean defence ministry spokesman, said military officials will closely monitor the drills.

Both North Korea and South Korea regularly conduct artillery drills in the Yellow Sea.

'Our military is fully prepared,' said. Kim Min-Seok said after Pyongyang notified Seoul of its proposed drill.

'If any shell lands on our side of the border, South Korea will respond strongly.'

North Korea disputes the so-called Northern Limit Line drawn close to its shores at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

North Korea says it should run further south.

Tensions between the two nations have been mounting after North Korea carried out a similar drill on March 31 during which a number of shells dropped into South Korean waters. 

The drill prompted the two rivals to trade hundreds of rounds of live artillery fire.

Earlier this year there was a period of easing tensions which saw emotional family reunions between the divided Koreans.

Tensions between the two nations has been rising after North Korea carried out a similar drill on March 31

Meanwhile, South Korea has expressed outrage over an attack on its president by the North Korean government that likened her to a prostitute.

The tirade against Park Geun-hye far exceeded even the North's often strident standards.

The statement issued by the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea expressed anger over U.S. president Barack Obama's visit to Seoul last week.

It said Ms Park was like a 'despicable prostitute' with Mr Obama as her pimp.

The North's officials and state-run media frequently use inflammatory rhetoric. 

They have called past South Korean presidents dogs, but have shown a particular penchant for insulting Ms Park with slurs.

South Korea's president Park Geun-hye was likened to a 'prostitute' by the North Korean government

'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the U.S. and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,' the statement said.

It was carried by the North's state-run media on Sunday and broadcast on nationwide television today.

In a statement of its own, South Korea's Unification Ministry strongly criticised the comments, saying  they were immoral and contained words that were unacceptable.

It also noted North Korea just two months ago called for both Koreas to stop slandering each other.

At a joint news conference with Ms Park, Mr Obama said it may be time to consider further sanctions against North Korea 'that have even more bite'. 

South Korean officials have warned the North could be preparing for its fourth nuclear test. 

Ms Park said the North is 'fully ready now' to conduct another nuclear test.

'Obama's visit to South Korea sends a strong message to North Korea that its provocative acts cannot be tolerated,' she said.

The North's barrage against Ms Park was particularly ill-timed as it comes as her government is dealing with the tragedy of a ferry sinking that has left hundreds dead or missing.

The statement slammed Mr Obama for going to Seoul at such a time saying he should have postponed or shelved his trip.
