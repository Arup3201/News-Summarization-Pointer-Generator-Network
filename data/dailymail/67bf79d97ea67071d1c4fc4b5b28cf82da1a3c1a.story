A humpback whale that had been tangled in rope was spotted while swimming just off the coast of Sydney's Bondi Beach on Saturday.

The mighty animal appeared to have the right side of his tail caught in an orange rope when it was sighted by Whale Watching Sydney at around 3pm.Â 

'The rope is most likely from some fishing gear. Generally they get trapped in fish traps or crab traps that are dropped along the coast and are usually around 30 metres long with a cage at the end, but sometimes they may have picked up a drift net,' Whale Watching Sydney's manager Will Ford told the Daily Mail Australia.

It was sighted by Whale Watching Sydney at around 3pm but the group reported that it was 'swimming along fine and didn't seem to be in any stress'

'You can see that the rope is sort of going straight down and its taught, which means it has got a fair bit of gear underneath that it's towing along. If it was just a rope, it would be trailing along, not dragging down.'

The tour group reported however, that the animal was 'swimming along fine and didn't seem to be in any stress' when it was first seen.

Nevertheless, two of the group's boats stayed alongside the whale while they waited for NSW National Parks and Wildlife to arrive with disentanglement gear and assess the situation.

A spokeswoman for Whale Watching Sydney told the Daily Mail Australia that by the time NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service arrived it was already too dark for them to assess and free the whale.

An ORRCA spokesperson assured that spotters had been placed from the Central Coast to Port Stephans as of Sunday morning in an attempt to relocate the tangled mammal

An ORRCA spokesperson confirmed that the rescue teams lost sight of the whale, but assured that spotters had been placed from the Central Coast to Port Stephans as of Sunday morning in an attempt to relocate the tangled mammal.

It's been a sad migration season for whales across Australia with at least three entanglements off the coast of Sydney as well as one in the north coast where a beaching also occurred.

Mr Ford said that the increase in entanglements is not necessarily due to an increase in debree, but could instead be due to the rise in whale populations, leading to a rise in the number of the animals who head to warmer waters along the eastern coast fromm May to mid August each year.

'This year there are over 20,00 humpbacks traveling along the coast and in the past there were only 8,000,' Mr Ford said.

'The numbers have increased, so now you're seeing more incidents of them being beached and entangled, not particularly because there's more fishing gear but because there's more whales coming so close to the coast -but it is a problem.'

Another humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week, but finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later

Despite freezing temperatures and the potential danger, the spectators decided to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading

Mr Ford said that Maquarie University had begun researching the effectiveness of using 'pingers' on shark nets to ward off sea creatures including whales and thus prevent them from becoming entangled in the rope.

However funding for the project, under the Marine Mammal Conservation Initiative, was cut by the Abbott government this year.

A humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week on Thursday.

After a number of devastating failed rescue attempts, the young whale finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later.

Not long before the rescue, another humpback whale had to be freed off the coast of Byron Bay in NSW, after it became entangled in 30 metres of nylon rope.
