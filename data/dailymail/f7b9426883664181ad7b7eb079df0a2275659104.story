In danger: Jyllands Park Zoo say they may now kill their giraffe named Marius (the larger animal pictured)

A second Danish zoo has threatened to put down one of its healthy giraffes just days after Copenhagen Zoo slaughtered one to the disgust of animal lovers.

Jyllands Park Zoo said it was considering the measure against a giraffe which by coincidence was named Marius like the one killed on Sunday, according to Danish news agency Ritzau.

Staff at Copenhagen Zoo have received death treats after the zoo killed the 18-month-old healthy male giraffe because the animal's genes were already well represented in an international breeding programme that aims to maintain a healthy giraffe population in European zoos.

Zookeepers at Jyllands Park Zoo said the act is necessary because Marius may fight with a younger male already at the zoo when the female arrives.

And they insisted the death threats aimed at staff in Copenhagen would not deter them.

Keeper Janni Lojtved Poulsen said: 'We can't have two males and one female. Then there will be fights.'

She said that it might be possible to find another place for the giraffe to live, but that the probability is small. Like its namesake in Copenhagen, Jyllands Park Zoo's Marius is considered unsuitable for breeding.

'If the breeding programme coordinator decides that he should be put down, then that's what we'll do,' she said.

'Many places abroad where they do not do this, the animals live under poor conditions, and they are not allowed to breed either. We don't think that's okay.'

Perfectly healthy: Another Danish zoo may put down one of its giraffes just days after Marius (above) was shot dead and autopsied in the presence of visitors at Copenhagen Zoo

She said that zoos in Denmark have been 
killing surplus animals for many years.

The zoo has not yet decided 
whether it will carry out a public dissection.

Jyllands Park Zoo in western Denmark 
might put down its seven-year-old Marius if the zoo manages to acquire a
 female giraffe, which is most likely, zoo keeper Janni Lojtved Poulsen 
told Ritzau.

The zoo also has a younger male called Elmer.

The 
giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo was dissected in front of crowds at the zoo, 
and afterwards, some of the carcass was then fed to other zoo animals 
and some was sent to research projects in Denmark and abroad for study.

Poulsen said Jyllands Park Zoo has not yet considered whether it should carry out a public dissection as the one in Copenhagen.

Animal rights campaigners dismissed the trend as barbaric.

A spokesman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) group said: 'As if to ram home the idea that zoos serve no purpose other than to incarcerate intelligent animals so as to turn a profit, a second Danish zoo now proposes to slaughter a giraffe, over the world's objections.

'Zoos spend millions on keeping animals on display like living museum exhibits and dispose of them when they become inconvenient.

'For anyone who cares about giraffes and other individuals serving life sentences in zoos, the giraffe "culling" should confirm that zoos are hideous institutions that do not deserve public support.'
