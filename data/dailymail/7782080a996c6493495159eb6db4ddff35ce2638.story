Medical insurance companies who speak ill of the Affordable Care Act are getting phone calls from the Obama administration warning them to be quiet, according to a new report.

White House spokesman Jay Carney quickly called the report 'preposterous and inaccurate,' but a CNN report alleged Wednesday night that insurance executives 'are willing to listen to the White House because right now, it is the federal government that's [their] biggest customer.'

And a prominent health insurance consultant said during the report that his clients have asked him to go public because they fear retaliation from the government that regulates their business.

'They feel defenseless before the White House P.R. team. The sources said they fear White House retribution,' CNN reporter Drew Griffin explained.

Investigative reporter Drew Griffin appeared Wednesday on two CNN shows with allegations that the Obama administration is putting the screws to anti-Obamacare insurance companies

Not so fast: President Barack Obama publicly defended his signature legislation Wednesday in Boston, even as his administration is reportedly working to silence its critics

'Government backed plans accounted for about 48 percent of healthcare policies last year ... So basically, the insurance companies are in a position to just be quiet for fear of offending their biggest source of income.'

'The White House,' said Health Policy Strategy Associates chief Bob Laszewski, 'is exerting massive pressure on the industry, including the trade associations, to keep quiet.'

Some of those business have publicly criticized the rollout of the Affordable Care Act anyway, and scoffed at the disastrous performance of its front-end website, healthcare.gov.

Those public rebukes, Griffin said, bring a swift response from the Obama team.

'Basically, if you speak out, if you’re quoted, you’re going to get a call from the White House, pressure to be quiet,' he reported.

Laszewski said some insurance companies warned the administration early on that the regulations imposed on them would lead to widespread policy cancellations since many of the plans already in force didn't comply with a laundry list of new requirements.

'I think the administrative mess you’re seeing right now,' he said, 'is indicative of what happens when somebody tries to run somebody else's business who thinks they’re smarter than you are.'

The White House quickly denied the claim that it's warning insurers to stay quiet, calling the report 'preposterous and inaccurate'

Under pressure: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius withstood aggressive questioning in a congressional hearing Wednesday, defending the Obamacare plan against charges that it was causing millions to lose the health insurance plans they chose

The White House has taken flak in the past week as news emerged that insurance companies have already cancelled at least 2 million plans bought on the individual market.

Obama had promised for years that Americans who wanted to keep their existing insurance would be allowed to keep it.

But an intensely restrictive set of requirements has squeezed most of those policies out of such 'grandfather' status, leaving policyholders at the mercy of government-run exchanges – whose biggest website has been chronically out of service since its Oct. 1 launch.

A change to a policy as minor as a tweaked copay schedule or an increased premium will render it ineligible for that 'grandfathered' status in the future.

Estimates of the number of consumers affected by those cancellations have ranged as high as 20 million.

Marilyn Tavenner, the Medicare and Medicaid administrator who was in charge of the website effort, testified in a congressional hearing Tuesday that Obamacare isn't to blame for the zeroed-out policies.

Health Policy Strategy Associates chief Bob Laszewski told Anderson Cooper that 'the administrative mess you're seeing right now is indicative of what happens when somebody tries to run somebody else's business'

Not our fault: Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Tuesday on Capitol Hill that Obamacare was designed to move people from lousy health care plans to better ones

'Half of the people in the individual market prior to 2010 didn't stay on their policies,' Tavenner claimed.

'They were either kicked off for pre-existing conditions, they saw their premiums go up at least 20 percent a year, and there were no protections for them. And sometimes they were in plans that they thought were fine until they actually needed hospitalization, and they found out it didn't cover hospitalization or it didn't cover cancer.'

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, too, defended the insurance-company cancellations when she had her turn on the congressional hot seat Wednesday.

Obamacare's uniform minimum standards, she claimed, 'will finally provide the kind of protections we all enjoy in our health care plans. Individuals who buy insurance on their own have never had that kind of health security.'

That protection comes at a price, however, as millions of Americans have found their rates will increase under the Affordable Care Act, including for the young people the White House desperately needs to attract.

A spokesman for Obama told reporters yesterday that 'the president has complete confidence in Secretary Sebelius.'

Obama, however, has plunged to an all-time low approval rating, with just 42 per cent of Americans giving his job performance a thumbs-up.
