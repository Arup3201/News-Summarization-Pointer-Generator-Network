Manchester City footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter (pictured) has been bailed following his arrest on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving

Manchester City footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter stood in the street shouting 'it wasn't me! It wasn't me!', after his car was involved in a crash that left two people dead.

Driver Kulwant Singh, 32, was killed 
with his sister Ravel-Kaur Singh, 37, when their red Nissan Micra 
collided with a silver Mercedes which the Premier League player, 18, was
driving.

Ravel-Kaur's two sons named by relatives 
as Amjit, 17, and Harveen, 16, who were in the back seat, both suffered head injuries and are fighting for their lives in hospital.

Mr Singh was reportedly pulling out 
from a local Sikh temple along with his sister and nephews after 
attending a religious anniversary day.

An eyewitness told the Manchester Evening News: ‘The driver of the Mercedes was standing in the middle of the road shouting "it wasn’t me, it wasn’t me".

‘Everyone ran from the temple – there were probably about 200 people in there. Mr Singh was taking his sister home after the festival and then coming back for his wife and kids.

Meppen-Walter and a 19-year-old man who was driving a Volkswagen Golf, were arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Yesterday, the pair who are believed to be friends were released on bail as detectives revealed they are investigating whether they were racing each other. 

A spokesman for Greater Manchester 
Police said: 'Two men arrested on suspicion of causing death by 
dangerous driving following a fatal collision in north Manchester have 
been bailed.'

Amjit
was last night in a critical condition at Salford Royal Hospital, but 
his younger brother’s head injury was not thought to be 
life-threatening.

The teenagers are understood to have lost their father some years ago.

Meppen-Walter,
who turned 18 last month, had written on Twitter about passing his 
driving test at the first attempt and his excitement about getting his 
first car.

Meppen-Walter, from Bury, joined the 
academy at Manchester City, Britain’s wealthiest club, at the age of 10
and was a regular for England under-17s before progressing to the under
18s.

Police were called to Bury New Road (above), Manchester, at its junction with Sherborne Street following reports of a collision (file picture)

Currently out of 
action with a knee injury, the central defender has yet to play for the 
Premier League champions’ first team. The collision happened in North 
Manchester at about 10.15pm on Saturday.

Mr Singh and his sister had to be cut free from the car and were pronounced dead at the scene.

Superintendent Neil Bhole, of Greater Manchester Police, refused to comment on ‘speculation or rumour’ about what happened but promised that a thorough investigation would establish all the facts.

The defender has not yet broken into Manchester City's first team, but was a regular for England Under-17s
