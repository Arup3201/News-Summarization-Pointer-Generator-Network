They were heroes in the Battle of Britain and the first line of our defence against Luftwaffe bombers.

But 70 years on from their Second World War heyday there are only a handful of iconic Hawker Hurricanes left.

Now a rare chance for fighter plane fans to snap one up at a public auction has come about - if they have £1.7million.

Iconic: The Hawker Hurricane which is up for sale at Bonhams for £1.7million. It was built in 1942 and is one of just a handful of airworthy examples in existence world-wide

The fully-restored Hurricane comes complete with its throaty Merlin engine and 12 original Browning machine guns.

Tim Schofield, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'This is one of only a handful of these iconic aircraft still flying today, and is presented for sale in highly original condition.'

The remarkable single-seater, one of just a handful of survivors from the 14,000 Hurricanes built, dates from 1942.

It joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and is thought to have taken part in protecting convoys from German U-boats.

While the Spitfire is fondly remembered as the iconic plane that defended our shores during the Battle of Britain, it was in fact the Hawker Hurricane that downed more Nazi planes.

Some 55 per cent of the 2,739 German losses were caused by the Hurricane. However, this has gone almost unrecognised due to the Spitfire's glamour, an appeal that resonated with wartime Britons as a result of successful government propaganda films.

Here are some Hawker Hurricane facts:

Introduced - 1937

Total number of planes built - 14,533

Wingspan - 40ft

Engine - Rolls Royce Merlin 1,185hp at 21,000ft

Max speed - 339mph

Armament - 4 x 20mm cannons, 2 x 226kg bombs

Number of Hurricanes at start of Battle of Britain - 2,309

Planes lost during Battle of Britain - 565

The Hurricane has been restored in Battle of Britain colours, and was kept at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire.

It is expected to sell for between £1.4million and £1.7million when it goes under the hammer as part of a sale of collectors’ cars and motoring memorabilia at Brooklands in Surrey on December 3.

The Hurricane, the Royal Air Force’s first monoplane fighter, had its finest hour during that battle, where it shot down more enemy aircraft than its famous service partner the Spitfire.

Brooklands, where the Bonhams sale will take place, has its own history with the aircraft. It was assembled and first flown in prototype form there in 1935, and altogether more than 3,000 Hurricanes were produced on site - one fifth of the total built.

Struck off charge from the RCAF in 1947, it was bought by a Canadian syndicate. It was later restored to flight, making its first post-restoration flight in 1989, before being acquired by the Historic Aircraft Collection in 2002 and housed at Duxford.

Other lots include the 1935 Ford used as Lance Cpl Jones’s butcher’s van in the classic TV series Dad’s Army. It is expected to go for £30,000.
