Sitting in front of a computer all day can make you feel lazy, affect your posture and even cause long-term health damage.

But if you can’t afford a treadmill desk, the next best thing is to build your very own human hamster wheel.

The wheel is made of plywood, skate wheels and a pint of glue and can be fitted over an existing desk -  but you may need to get permission from your boss to use it.

The Hamster Wheel Standing Desk was designed by California-based art graduate Robb Godshaw (pictured). Each wheel (pictured) consists of plywood, skate wheels and a pint of glue and is 61cm (24 inches) wide, and has a two-metre (80-inch) diameter. It was designed to make office workers less sedentary

California-based art graduate Robb Godshaw designed the wheel to make office workers less sedentary.

‘You are not reaching your current productivity potential,’ explained Mr Godshaw.

TrekDesk is a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work.

The manufacturer claims the height-adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health, reduce stress, prevent disease and strengthen muscles.

Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. 

It costs $499 (£300), is designed to fit over any treadmill and features a manuscript holder.

‘Rise up, sedentary sentients, and unleash that untapped potential within by marching endlessly towards a brilliant future of focused work.

‘Step forward into a world of infinite potential, bounded only by the smooth arcs of a wheel. Step forward into the Hamster Wheel Standing Desk that will usher in a new era of unprecedented productivity.’

Mr Godshaw has added step-by-step DIY instructions to design site Instructables so other people can build their own version of his wheel.

According to the project files, the wheel was designed using Autodesk Inventor and it took Mr Godshaw and his friends 24 hours to build. 

A timelapse video on the site shows the 61cm (24-inch) wide, two-metre (80-inch) diameter wheel being built.

To create the wheel at home, builders will need four sheets of plywood, four skate wheels, two pipes, 240 wood screws, and a pint of glue.

Mr Godshaw said he considered adding brakes to the wheel, but decided against it 'to really force the productivity out of the desk user.'

The use of the skateboard wheels means the design has a more fluid rotation, without the need for an axle.

'We already had a standing desk that fit through the wheel, so it was just a matter of avoiding interference and leaving enough room for a human,' continued Mr Godshaw.  

Mr Goddshaw claims the wheel can also be used as a ‘wheel of death’ or ‘an uncomfortable bench.’
