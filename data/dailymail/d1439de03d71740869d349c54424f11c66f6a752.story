Mexican soldiers discovered the largest marijuana plantation in the country's history, hidden under black cloth in the middle of the desert.

The 300-acre plantation is four times larger than the previous record discovery by authorities and workers had even installed toilet facilities, the Defence Department said.

The towering pot plants sheltered under black screen-cloth in a huge square on the floor of the Baja California desert, more than 150 miles south of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego.

Army general Alfonso Duarte said the screening, which is often used by regular farmers to protect crops from too much sun or heat, made it difficult to smell what was growing underneath.

It was only when soldiers on the ground reached the isolated area on Tuesday that they found thousands of pot plants as high as 2.5 meter tall.

More than 40,000 people have died in drug violence in Mexico since late 2006.

Over 9,300 people have been gunned down in Ciudad Juarez alone since early 2008 when the rival Juarez and Sinaloa cartels began an all-out war for rich trafficking routes.

That conflict has unleashed further violence as local gangs battle over street corner drug rackets, and turn to kidnapping and extortion.

The Mexican military and federal police sent to curb the mayhem are also blamed by many residents for killings and other abuses.

The average height of the plants was about 1.5 yards (meters).

'We estimate that in this area, approximately 60 people were working. When they saw the military personnel, they fled,' Gen Duarte told reporters.

A few were later reportedly detained at a nearby roadblock, but he added no arrests were made at the scene.

He said traffickers could have 
harvested about 120 tons of marijuana from the plantation, worth about 
1.8 billion pesos or about $160 million.

The discovery comes as drug related violence in Mexico's troubled border states has taken a dramatic upswing over the last few months.

Last Friday At least 17 people were killed in a bar massacre night in the northern Mexico city of Monterrey when riflemen opened fire on bystanders and staff.

And on Monday 10 decapitated bodies were found in the northern Mexican city of Torreon.

The bodies were dumped in the back of a truck with their heads scattered across the city.

Authorities said the killers left a message directed at another gang.

The cartels have also become more brazen in the face of ongoing efforts by the Mexican army to curb their operations.

Yesterday, two separate raids by Mexican government special forces left nine gunmen dead.

Raids on a Monterrey weapons training ground left four dead, while five more were killed after an SUV carrying members of another cartel opened fire on troops in the town of Cadereyta.

Monterrey, a major industrial hub, 
has seen a spike of violence since the Gulf and Zeta cartels began 
fighting for control of drug traffic there two years ago.

On Thursday Mexican journalist Armando Rodriguez, renowned for his coverage of gangland slayings in his hometown of Ciudad Juarez, lay dead in a casket, shot by suspected cartel hitmen.

As his colleague Jorge Luis Aguirre drove to the funeral home in the dismal border city to pay his last respects, his cell phone rang. The husky voice delivered a chilling warning: 'You're next.'

'I left Ciudad Juarez in panic the same day,' said Aguirre, the former editor of news website La Polaka.

The newsman joined a growing number 
of Mexicans fleeing raging drug cartel violence in and around Ciudad 
Juarez to begin a long-shot bid for political asylum next door in the 
United States.

Video of the plantation showed a 
sophisticated system of piped-in irrigation to support the plants, which
 Gen Duarte said was fed by two wells.

The plantation also included some wooden outbuildings, presumably for use by people caring for the plants.

Troops will destroy the fields by burning them, Duarte said.

While it's unknown how much of Mexican drug cartels' income comes from marijuana, recent discoveries suggest it remains a large-scale trade.

Last October, Mexican authorities made their largest-ever seizure of marijuana packaged for sale, a record 148 tons (134 metric tons) found in a number of tractor trailers and houses in Tijuana.

They appeared to make up a major distribution center traced directly to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, Mexico's most-wanted fugitive, who has expanded the reach of his Sinaloa cartel along the U.S.-Mexico border since escaping from prison in 2001.

In November, U.S. and Mexican investigators found two long, sophisticated tunnels under the border between Baja California and California, along with more than 40 tons of marijuana in and around the tunnels.

The tunnels ran about 2,000 feet from Mexico to San Diego and were equipped with lighting, ventilation and a rail system for drugs to be carried on a small cart.

The biggest ever plantation in Mexico prior to this week's discovery was in northern Chihuahua state in 1984. 

U.S. officials say they believe the tunnels also were the work of the Sinaloa cartel.

While the Arellano Felix or Tijuana cartel long dominated the drug trade in Baja California, the cartel has been greatly weakened by government hits on its leadership, and authorities say there are signs that the Sinaloa cartel now also operates in the area.

Duarte said he did not know which group operated the plantation found Tuesday.
