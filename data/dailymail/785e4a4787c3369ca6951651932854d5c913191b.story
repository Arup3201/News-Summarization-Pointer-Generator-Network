A teenage girl was raped by two men on a double decker bus after leaving a shopping centre with her friend.

The 14-year-old was attacked on the top deck of the 57 bus as it left Silverburn shopping centre in Pollok, Glasgow.

When the girls got on the bus, they took a seat downstairs. The victim went to the upper deck where she got into a conversation with two men who boarded the bus in the city centre.

The two girls got onto a number 57 bus which was leaving Silverburn shopping centre in Pollok, Glasgow

She was then assaulted and raped by both of them. Her friend, also 14, went up to see her and raised the alarm with passengers downstairs.

A woman and two men came to the girls’ aid. They all left the bus two stops along from Silverburn.

The passengers are said to have waited with them until they got another bus home, thought to be in the Darnley area of the city, where police were contacted.

The incident took palce at around 10.30pm on Friday, March 22.

No CCTV footage is available from the bus while Strathclyde Police are appealing for those passengers to come forward to help their investigation.

Both of the attackers are said to be aged around 18 to 20. One is about 5ft 10ins, with a shaved head and wearing a black jumper.

The other man has brown, spiky hair and was wearing a tracksuit which may have been grey, with a body warmer or jacket.

Detective Constable Jackie Carroll, from Greater Glasgow CID, said: 'This was a very frightening experience for the young girl concerned and, thankfully, she was assisted by her friend and the good samaritans on the bus who ensured she got home safely.

'She has been left traumatised by her ordeal. We’re continuing extensive inquiries into the incident and would like to trace two men and a woman who came to her assistance as they will have vital information which could help with our investigation.

'We know that the men responsible boarded the bus in the city centre. The men were very loud and using crude and lewd comments to other passengers.

'The bus driver ejected the two men from the bus at Pollokshaws Road (near Queen’s Park) around 12.30am.

'I would like to speak to anyone who may have been present on the bus at the time of the attack, as it is imperative we trace these men.'

A spokesman for First Glasgow said the driver of the bus did not see the incident.

He told STV Glasgow: 'We are assisting the police with their investigation and would echo their appeal for anyone to come forward who may have information about the incident.

'Our driver was not aware of the assault. Unfortunately, the incident took place on the top deck of the bus and therefore out of our driver's eyeline and no-one on board approached our driver to report a disturbance.

'The driver ejected the two males in question sometime later in the journey - this was due to separate unruly behaviour.

'The safety and security of our staff and passengers is our number one priority and we will continue to do everything we can to help the police apprehend the perpetrators.'

'Our thoughts are very much with the victim of the assault,' he added.
