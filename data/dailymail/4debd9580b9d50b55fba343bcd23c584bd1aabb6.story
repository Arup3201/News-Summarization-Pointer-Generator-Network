The parents of a five-month-old boy who died from rickets after they neglected his care because of their religious beliefs were jailed today.

Seventh Day Adventists Nkosiyapha Kunene, 36, and his wife Virginia, 32, from Erith, Kent, who admitted the manslaughter of their son Ndingeko, received three years and two years, three months' imprisonment respectively. The couple admitted the charge at earlier hearings.

Mr Justice Singh, at the Old Bailey, said: ‘The secular courts of this country apply the secular law of the land. They do so equally to all who come before them. The law respects the right of everyone to freedom of thought and belief.

‘However the right to manifest one's religion is not absolute. It is limited in particular by the rights of others. The state has a particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young child is concerned.’

The death of a baby boy from rickets arose from the religious beliefs of parents Nkosiyapha Kunene (right) and his wife, Virginia (left), a court heard today. The couple have admitted the manslaughter of their son, Ndingeko

The judge said Ndingeko was born on January 1 2012 and died in June 14 that year.

He was found to have been suffering from rickets resulting from severe Vitamin D deficiency.

The court heard the child was born at Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford.

From birth, he had medical problems, and the judge said it was emphasised on behalf of the couple that the vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed at that stage, nor was Virginia Kunene given advice about taking supplements.

The mother did not attend a scheduled check up on March 8 and Ndingeko was not seen by a health care professional from then on to the day he died.

Mr Justice Singh, at the Old Bailey, said: 'The state has a particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young child is concerned'

From April it was appreciated by the couple that their son was unwell, although his health fluctuated over the next two months.

‘It is clear that, because of their own religious beliefs, the defendants did not in fact seek medical assistance.’

Richard Whittam QC told Mr Justice Singh at the couple’s sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey that, 
although their beliefs arose out of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, 
that church does not approve of medical care being withheld. The couple 
admitted the charge at earlier hearings.

Mr Whittam, prosecuting, said the case arose out of religious belief, the overarching belief held principally by Nkosiyapha Kunene that there was a God in Heaven who would guide the family when it came to any matter that affected life.

He said: ‘There is no suggestion of any ill treatment in the conventional way of neglect or cruelty, it is a neglect to seek proper medical care and then to call medical care at the end.’

The child was born on January 1 2012 and died on June 14 that year, and was suffering from rickets, resulting from a severe Vitamin D deficiency, the court heard.

‘There was, throughout the better part of pregnancy and into early life, a rejection of either medical advice or advice from relatives to seek medical advice,’ Mr Whittam said.

Nkosiyapha was baptised into the Seventh Day Adventist Church in 2000 and in 2009 was recommended to be a delegate to its South England Conference.

Mr Whittam told Mr Justice Singh at the couple's sentencing hearing that, although their beliefs arose out of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, that church does not approve of medical care being withheld

‘He was highly regarded in the church,’ counsel said.

A
 senior figure in the church had said that the couple’s views, as 
reported to him by police investigating the case, were perhaps the most 
extreme that he had ever encountered.

Mr
 Whittam said: ‘The reality is that had rickets been diagnosed earlier, 
and appropriate treatment given, there could have been a complete 
recovery, and therefore the death was avoidable.’

Nkosiyapha remains of the view that death was God’s will, counsel said.

Kerim
 Fuad QC, defending Nkosiyapha Kunene, said: ‘This court will rarely 
have before it such a gentle, humble and hitherto law-abiding peaceful 
couple.’

He said his client could be a responsible, adoring and essentially wonderful father. The attraction of a suspended custodial sentence, with a lengthy supervision requirement, was obvious.

‘The loss of their son haunts them, and will do, for the rest of their lives. They don’t expect that pain to pass.’

He added: ‘The covenant he (Nkosiyapha) had sworn with God blinded his objectivity and common sense.’

Nkosiyapha, who was working as a nurse at King’s College Hospital, did not reject medical treatment outright.

‘He simply believes that a large amount of modern medicine is procedural and formulaic. He believes medicines are given to patients without much thought as to whether they are appropriate to a particular case.’

Mr Whittam told the Old Bailey that, although their beliefs arose out of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, that church does not approve of medical care being withheld

Mr Fuad said the baby was discharged from the hospital at Darent Valley without his mother being given the essential Vitamin D that she desperately needed.

She is a vegan, and more starved of Vitamin D than most, Mr Fuad said.

Had the Vitamin D deficiency been diagnosed, the parents would have been alert to the need to be vigilant. But the Vitamin D levels were not tested until after the child’s death.

Sallie Bennett-Jenkins, defending Virginia Kunene, said: ‘Nobody could fail to be moved by this tragedy. Or the suffering of that baby’s mother.

‘She has confronted the reality that she failed the child, by virtue of her view that it would be a breach of a covenant made between her, her husband and their God, and an abandonment of her sincerely-held religious views.’

Rickets is caused by a lack of Vitamin D and calcium and can cause deformities

Rickets is a disease, which affects 
bone development in children. The condition causes bones to become soft 
and weak, leading to deformities.

In adults the disease is referred to as osteomalacia or soft bones.

The
 most common cause of rickets is a lack of Vitamin D and calcium. 
Vitamin D is essential for children to form strong bones and comes from 
exposure to sunlight. It is also found in oily foods, including fish and
 eggs.

In rare cases, some children are born with a genetic form of the disease. 

Rickets is referred to as a Victorian-era disease, due to its prominence at the turn of the century.

It
 has largely disappeared in the Western world, thanks to the rise in 
Vitamin D enriched foods, including margarine and cereals.

But
 in recent years, experts have warned of an increasing number of cases 
in the UK. While still relatively small numbers - 900 cases were 
diagnosed in 2012 - studies have revealed a high number of people in the
 UK have low levels of Vitamin D in their blood.

Any
 child with a lack of Vitamin D in their diet can develop the disease. 
But the condition is more prevalent in children with dark skin, due to 
the fact more sunlight is needed to deliver enough Vitamin D. Those born
 premature and children taking medication that can interfere with 
Vitamin D are also at a higher risk of developing the disease.

Rickets
 is easily prevented. A child's hands and face only have to be exposed 
to sunlight for around 15 minutes several times a week in spring and 
summer to provide enough of the vital Vitamin. That combined with a 
healthy diet incorporating Vitamin D and calcium-rich foods help 
strengthen the bones.

Children
 with rickets are more likely to fracture their bones. The condition can
 cause pain, poor growth and deformities, including bowed legs, 
curvature of the spine and a thickening of the ankles, wrists and knees.

The disease is easily treated through encouraging a child to eat the correct foods and take vitamin supplements.
