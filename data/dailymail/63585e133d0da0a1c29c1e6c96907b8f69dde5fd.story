A campaigner infuriated by sloppy parking in his town has been praised for shaming drivers and posting pictures to a Facebook group.

The parking vigilante has taken scores of images of badly and illegally parked vehicles in Lowestoft, Suffolk and claims the authorities are not punishing offenders.

The man, known only as Stuart, said his ‘Park It Right Lowestoft’ page, which has had over 2,000 likes, is designed to persuade motorists to be more considerate.

He has captured vehicles taking up two spaces in car parks and some dumped on double-yellow lines.

He said: ‘I started the page to highlight how bad the parking is round here and the potential danger it causes. 

‘There are never any wardens around and the situation is getting worse week by week.’

Stuart, who is asking people to send their own pictures into the page, continued: ‘People just abandon their cars wherever they feel like it.

The campaigner has been praised by Waveney District Council for his 'public service' after shaming motorists

‘It's very selfish because it is often inconvenient, poses a safety risk and is very annoying.’

He added: ‘Some of my friends and family think I shouldn't be bothering, but some of the parking is just dangerous and selfish and it's annoying.’

He has also handed some of his photographs of offenders, which clearly show the date time and places as well as registration number, to local police community support officers.

A Lowestoft police spokesman said: ‘We urge people not to park irresponsibly.

‘Inconsiderate parking will be targeted because it can cause an obstruction. It can lead to warning notices, fixed penalty tickets and even the seizure and removal of vehicles.’

Stuart said family and friends have told him not to bother but he thinks the parking is 'dangerous' and 'selfish'

Staff at Waveney District Council praised his ‘public service’ but denied that they lacked resources to tackle the problem.

A spokesman for the authority said: ‘We do have regular patrols to monitor parking in the town. But it is not always possible to witness and take action against every example of bad or illegal parking.

‘Any public support and awareness for considerate parking can only be a good thing and if people wish to report incidents like this they can call us.’

Deputy council leader Stephen Ardley said: ‘We do provide a seven-day-a-week parking inspector service and we have issued almost 1,000 charge notices for various car parking offences.

‘There is concern and we are urging everybody to drive and park legally with consideration for others.’

But not everyone agrees with the campaign - one irate Facebook comment said: ‘He should go out and get a life.’
