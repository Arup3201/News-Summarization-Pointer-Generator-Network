A student has told how she was conned by the BBC into believing its journalist was a history professor so he travel to North Korea for a Panorama investigation.

The London School of Economics student, who wants to remain anonymous, has intensified pressure on the BBC, which is under fire over a Pyongyang documentary shown last night.

The student told MailOnline: '[Panorama journalist] John Sweeney was presented to use as a
history professor from a university in Beijing.

'I was wondering why they were filming him so much. It was two days before then end of the trip that I realised he was an undercover journalist.'

The claims follow an interview with a student in today's Daily Mail who said she felt exploited and put at risk by the BBC.

Meanwhile tensions again heightened on the Korean peninsula, with the North's military warning of 'sledge-hammer blows' in retaliation to protests in the South against leader Kim Jong Un.

Undercover: An LSE student has come forward today to reveal that some travellers believed Panorama reporter John Sweeney was a history professor until two days before the end of their trip to North Korea

The student said that the Panorama film crew, whose documentary was broadcast last night, at no point warned the young travellers of the risks they faced travelling with them to the dictatorship.

It is claimed that the group were only informed they would be accompanied by a single print journalist, with no indication that the journalist would be travelling undercover.

'We realised things as we went along,' said the student, who has asked MailOnline not to publish any identifying details out of fear of reprisals by the murderous North Korean regime.

'I just know that at the point that I accepted [a place on the trip] I didn't know that the journalist would be undercover.'

The latest testimony comes after a young woman yesterday spoke to the Mail to tell how ten students, the youngest just 18, only learned they were 'cover' for the BBC's filming hours before entering North Korea.

But the most shocking claims involved the cover story given to Mr Sweeney, who presented the Panorama documentary.

Exploited: The LSE student, who has asked to remain anonymous, said that at no point when organisers asked for confirmation did they reveal that the group would be travelling with an undercover investigative journalist

It was believed that his posing as an LSE history professor was a ruse to fool North Korean authorities, but the latest account suggests that many students on the trip actually believed he was a real professor.

The BBC today reiterated its denial that students were tricked and released statements from two students on the trip who said they were made completely aware that they would be travelling with an undercover documentary team.

Mila Akimova, one of those students, said: 'I can speak for myself that I went on the trip fully aware that if we were discovered we may even be arrested - which is the reason I insisted on using my Russian passport (I also hold an EU country passport) to make the NK visa – a Russian citizen is less likely to be prosecuted.

'Yes, the BBC lied to North Korea - but in my opinion a regime like that deserves to be lied to, and it surprises me that the LSE - after the Gaddafi scandal - is trying to cancel a documentary exposing a dictatorship.'

The second student, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that organisers had repeatedly made clear to the group they would be joined by a journalist and that this could pose a risk to them if they were found out.

'To me, it seemed the worst thing possible to happen would be to be expelled from North Korea and not be allowed to re-enter the country,' said the student.

'I decided that to be a risk to be very worth taking in order to experience the uniqueness of North Korea.'

The young student's statements come as North Korea today vowed 'sledge-hammer blows' against the South after protests against the regime's leading dynasty, warning that attacks will start 'without notice'.

It demanded that South Korean authorities apologise for protests in the capital Seoul where demonstrators had burned a portrait of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The chilling ultimatum came after tensions had eased slightly on the Korean peninsula as the pariah state celebrated the birth of its first leader, Kim Il Sung.

In recent days the North has threatened nuclear attacks on the U.S., South Korea and Japan after new sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in February.

The shrill threats had gone quiet yesterday as the country marked the 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, raising hopes for an easing of tension in a region that has for weeks seemed on the verge of conflict.

But the North's KCNA news agency said today the North Korean army had issued an ultimatum to the South after rallies in the South on Monday at which portraits of North Korea's leaders were burned.

'Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,' KCNA reported, citing military leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as North Korea is officially known.

'The military demonstration of the DPRK's revolutionary armed forces will be powerful sledge-hammer blows at all hostile forces hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership.'

Small counter-protests by South Koreans calling for dialogue with the North were also held, South Korean media reported.

The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, describing them as a 'hostile' act.

The U.S. had dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers to take part.

But in the latest ultimatum the North did not threaten America. Instead it reserved its anger for what it calls South Korea's 'puppet' government.

It even mentioned the possibility of dialogue, suggesting that it was not really about to launch war in response to routine protests by at most a few dozen people in Seoul, despite the anger they raised.

'If the puppet authorities truly want dialogue and negotiations, they should apologise for all anti-DPRK hostile acts, big and small, and show the compatriots their will to stop all these acts,' said the North's military.

Taking no chances: But a South Korean diplomat today said the latest ultimatum was 'not worth a response'

A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman later told a briefing the North Korean ultimatum was not worth a response and South Korea was waiting for the North to make a 'wise decision'.

Last week, the South's President Park Geun-hye offered talks but the North rejected the overture as a 'cunning' ploy.

Mr Park will meet U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on May 7 to discuss economic and security issues, including 'countering the North Korean threat', the White House said on Monday.

The U.S. has also offered talks with the North, but on the pre-condition that it abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions.

That seems unlikely, as North Korea has described its nuclear weapons as a 'treasured sword' and has vowed to never give them up.

Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, as he yesterday ended a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution.

Mr Kerry had a day earlier appeared to open the door to talking even without steps towards nuclear disarmament by the North

A day earlier Mr Kerry had appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearisation steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary.

North Korea has so far conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability.

Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions that were expanded after the North exploded an atom bomb in February.

The aim of the North's aggression, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson Kim Il-Sung, or to force the U.S. into talks.

The U.S. has 28,000 troops in South Korea.

A U.S. military helicopter crashed in a region near the border with North Korea on Tuesday with 14 people on board, all of them U.S. soldiers, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.

There were no reports of injuries and the cause of the accident, which happened when the helicopter was landing, was being investigated, Yonhap said.
