Getting dressed up is 
part of the Royal Ascot experience and the likes of Princess Beatrice, Zara Tindall 
and, of course, the Queen, are perfect examples of how to dress appropriately for the 
event. But it seems that one guest didn't pay attention.

Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina 
Rihanoff turned up to the annual racing event wearing a blue and white 
flapper-style dress that was made out of what appeared to be betting 
slips.

The Russian dancer was asked to change and was escorted away from the event by a 
member of security, who covered her with a black blazer.

It all started so well! Kristina Rihanoff turned up to the event wearing a dress made of Coral betting slips on the second day of Royal Ascot 2014, Ascot Racecourse, Berkshire. But things soon took a turn for the worse

No entry! Kristina, who wore a dress made from Coral betting slips, was led away from the event because her outfit didn't conform to the strict  dress code

Well that's embarrassing! The Strictly star was even covered up with a large blazer by the security guard who led her away from the prestigious event

Awkward! The Russian dancer was lead away with a blazer covering her betting slip dress but still had a smile on her face

It appears that the dancer's fashion faux pas may well have been a PR stunt for betting site Coral, whose betting slips her dress was made out of.

The dancer was escorted away for contravening the Ascot dress code regulations, which have tightened up of late.

In a bid to 
reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event, which kicked off yesterday and runs until the 21st, the bosses at Ascot
introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 and they're still going strong.

'A day at Royal Ascot is very special and dressing accordingly is an important part of the experience,' states the guide.

If you're lucky enough to snag a seat in the Royal Enclosure, you're reminded that dresses and skirts should be of 'modest length' - defined as falling just above the knee or longer - and should have straps of one inch or greater. 

It must be a stunt! Kristina Rihanoff poses for photographers before being escorted away by security

Out she goes! Kristina hides behind the security guard as she walks away

Hats are, of course, compulsory but a headpiece which has a base of 4 inches (10cm) 
or more in diameter is acceptable as an alternative and fascinators are strictly forbidden.

Ladies within the 
main Grandstand enclosure are encouraged to dress in a manner as 'befits
 a formal occasion' - that translates as wearing a hat at all times, 
banning strapless dresses and concealing your midriff. 

Before the event, the excited 36-year-old tweeted: 'On my way to @RoyalAscot !! Wearing a fantastic creation by @bendelisi !!'

The dancer discarded her Ben de Lisi-designed betting slip dress and was later seen wearing a different outfit, this time one which conformed to the rules.

Coral’s Nicola McGeady said: 'Our betting slip dress combines the best bits of a day out at Royal Ascot – fabulous fashion and having a cheeky punt. And although, she had a false start, she quickly changed into a new outfit which adhered to the strict dress code.'

A spokesperson for Kristina said: 'Kristina wasn't asked to leave Ascot.

'It was always her intention to change her dress and she is still at Ascot enjoying the hospitality at the races.'

Much better! The dancer was later seen in a more appropriate outfit, lucky she packed a spare dress then!

Not AGAIN! Kristina really failed to comprehend today's dress code when she took off her blazer to reveal a spaghetti strapped dress
