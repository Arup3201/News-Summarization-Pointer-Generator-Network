Sweeping plans to close casualty departments carry a ‘code red’ risk of having a serious impact on patients’ health, a secret internal NHS study has revealed.

The shocking disclosure comes in a risk-assessment dossier, prepared by officials pushing for the closure of four out of nine A&E units in North-West London and obtained by The Mail on Sunday.

It comes as our campaign against the cuts gathers pace, and as:

Asked whether he would order a review of the closures in light of public opposition, Mr Hunt restated the policy of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, that changes must be ‘locally led’ by health professionals, and that ‘the interests of the local community must be key’. Critics say that, in fact, many doctors oppose the cuts, as does the public.

Where A&E units are facing closure, NHS bosses have insisted that they have only one aim – improving patient care – and not saving money.

Critical list: A&E units are being closed or downgraded, with the public being urged to voice their discontent

For example, in adverts designed to persuade sceptical residents of the benefits of radical closures in North-West London, NHS bosses say it is a ‘myth’ that the cuts have been drawn up in order to save money.

Yet the secret report from the ‘cluster board’ responsible for commissioning health care for the two million people in the area clearly states that one objective is to deliver £1 billion of savings by 2014.

The ads also state that it is a ‘myth’, that the changes will put patients’ lives at risk. Yet the internal report, discussed at a closed meeting on September 7, identifies a ‘significant’ risk of adverse effects. Its most damning section concerns a ‘new risk’ to ‘Objective One’, the reorganisation itself.

The risks are that the closure plans are ‘not accepted by patients, politicians and public’, that the care provided by GPs is ‘not robust enough’ to support the enormous extra burdens the closures will impose, and that the ‘new pathways of care’ will therefore not be successful.

The consequences – graded ‘code red’ for being ‘significant’ and ‘serious’ – would, the dossier admits, be ‘poor patient experience and outcomes’, ‘service gaps’, and the whole system becoming ‘unaffordable’.

Last night a spokesman for the  NHS in North-West London insisted that the risks would only apply if planned improvements to ‘out-of-hospital’ GP care did not go ahead.

He said: ‘We have said very clearly, in public meetings and in all our documents, that no changes would be made to any hospitals before we had first spent three years implementing the out-of-hospital changes.’

As to the £1 billion savings target, he said the NHS had never hidden its hopes to save money, but insisted that was not the main aim.

The spokesman’s statements drew a furious response from Labour MP Andy Slaughter, whose Hammersmith constituency includes two of the doomed A&Es, Hammersmith and Charing Cross. Ealing and Central Middlesex are the others. ‘It’s all very well saying no department will close for three years, but the decision will be announced in 2013,’ he said. ‘Once you’ve done that, how will the A&Es attract staff? They’re likely very quickly to wither away.’

Meanwhile, The Mail on Sunday today reveals another 11 areas where millions of patients could face longer journeys for A&E.

In Hertfordshire, A&Es at Hemel Hempstead and St Albans have already been replaced by downgraded units, while Welwyn Garden City’s A&E will close next year.

In Burnley, Lancashire, there is a growing campaign to reinstate the A&E ward closed four years ago.

And the A&E at either Redditch or Worcester in the West Midlands will be closed, with no decision on which made yet. Nearby Kidderminster Hospital already only has a minor injuries unit after its A&E was closed down, but it could now lose this too.

NHS chiefs say: ‘This change is being led by clinicians, who have said that doing nothing about the A&E situation is not an option. The proposed changes will improve patient safety and quality of service.’

Acute medical services at Neath Port Talbot hospital in South Wales were moved to Swansea and Bridgend last month. Although not strictly an A&E department, the unit could have treated heart attacks and strokes.

Three other hospitals stand to lose the ability to treat major trauma cases such as car accidents, effectively downgrading the departments.

The policy is designed to centralise specialist services, but many critics fear it is risking lives. Retired nurse Patricia Wright, 65, used to work at Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, which lost its capacity to deal with trauma cases four years ago.

She said: ‘Ambulance staff have told me that some patients didn’t make it as they had to be taken the 15 miles to Brighton.’

A hospital which complained that a Mail on Sunday article was ‘seriously misleading’ for reporting its casualty unit’s future was in doubt has been forced into a U-turn.

Stafford’s A&E department has been closed between 10pm and 8am since last December – a move it originally said was temporary.

But now bosses have had to cancel plans to reopen it at night, forcing about a dozen patients to travel long distances to alternatives every day.

Backtracked: Stafford Hospital has reneged on a plan to reopen its A&E

When we launched our campaign in July, we said the department’s long-term future was doubtful, prompting a hospital spokeswoman to demand a correction, saying: ‘We are planning to reopen our A&E overnight from October.’

But that plan has now been permanently shelved after the GP-led clinical commissioning groups, which cover the hospital’s area, said they were concerned about the A&E’s ‘sustainability’.

The hospital has a £46.6 million deficit, and a spokeswoman refused to rule out the possibility of the A&E closing altogether.

Lyn Hill-Tout, chief executive of the hospital trust, said in a written statement: ‘We will not reopen against their wishes, but will work with them to provide alternatives.’

The hospital spokeswoman was ‘unavailable’ to comment about her  earlier complaint.
