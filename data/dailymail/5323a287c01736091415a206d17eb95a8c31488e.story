The administrators of collapsed courier firm City Link have announced 2,356 redundancies after a rescue bid to buy the company failed.

Many of the company's staff found out about its collapse on Christmas Day and had been warned to expect 'substantial redundancies'. 

There had been a small degree of hope earlier today after Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, disclosed unconfirmed details of a possible rescue, with Business Secretary Vince Cable said to be aware of developments.

Today administrators announced ,356 redundancies after a rescue bid to buy the company failed. Pictured are staff demonstrating at a City Link depot in North Lanarkshire yesterday 

But the bid was deemed unacceptable and administrators Ernst & Young announced that 2,356 jobs at the parcel delivery firm were to be lost. 

The administrators said 371 people have been retained to deal with remaining parcels and to assist in realising the Company's assets and winding down its operations. 

Ernst and Young said the offer made by a consortium 'offered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired'.

They said: 'The administrators proposed an alternative structure that would be acceptable and common in these situations.

'The consortium, despite attempts to make them reconsider, declined to amend their original offer.'

The redundancies will affect the head office in Coventry as well as hubs and depots around the country.

There will be 468 job losses in 'Central Functions', which includes head office staff, and a further 279 staff will lose their jobs in the Coventry hub. The remaining redundancies relate to a number of different hubs and depots across the UK.

Hunter Kelly, joint administrator of City Link Limited, said: 'It is with regret that we have to announce substantial redundancies at City Link Limited, which ceased accepting new parcels on 24 December 2014.

The company endured substantial losses in the run up to Christmas and announced they were entering administration on Christmas Day 

'The company endured substantial losses, which ultimately became too great for it to continue as a going concern, and City Link Limited entered administration following an unsuccessful sale process.

'At meetings across City Link Limited's UK sites on Monday 29 December 2014 and Tuesday 30 December 2014, employees were informed that there would be substantial redundancies as no new business was being taken on.

'Many of these employees were sent home, and informed that they would shortly receive formal correspondence to confirm their work status.' 

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: "This is very sad news for the City Link workers and their families at a particularly difficult time of year.

"The Government has put arrangements in place to help employees who are made redundant and we stand ready to help.

"City Link employees and self-employed drivers who have their contracts terminated as a result of City Link's administration will be able to access the Government's rapid response service, which draws together local partners such as Jobcentre Plus and the skills bodies to deliver support for each person affected.

"In addition, a Facebook page has been set-up to link up companies holding suitable vacancies with those who have been made redundant, so if drivers can be redeployed into new jobs in this competitive buoyant market they will be."

Meanwhile the RMT union said the failure to secure jobs was a 'a disgraceful and cynical betrayal'.

Secretary General Mr Cash said: 'The confirmation from the administrators that they have just sacked 2400 staff and are pulling the plug on any efforts to save City Link is a disgraceful and cynical betrayal that will wreck the lives of our members, many of whom are owed thousands of pounds.

'RMT does not believe that those pulling the strings had any interest in saving this business and were happy to cut and run leaving a trail of human misery in their wake. The City Link collapse has blown the lid off the cosy relationship between bandit capitalism and the political elite.

Administrators estimate that around 30,000 parcels are still being held at City Link's 53 depots around the country

'RMT will continue to advise and represent our members caught in this corporate failure. Those responsible will slink away with their own resources ring fenced and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the redundancy tab. The City Link Christmas destruction is an act of industrial vandalism that shames our nation while the Government looked on and offered nothing but hollow words.'

While Scottish Labour's shadow cabinet secretary for finance, Jackie Baillie MSP, said: 'Our first thoughts are with the workers and their families who have found out that they have lost their jobs. This is a terrible way for them to start the New Year.

'It is essential that the Scottish Government now sends in a task force to provide the highest level and best quality support to the people who have been made redundant. Many of these City Link depots are located in parts of Scotland that already have high levels of unemployment. They cannot afford more people out of work.

'The first duty of the Scottish Government now is to find work for these men and women, including retraining them for other opportunities.' 

Yesterday staff returned to City Link depots for the first time since the news of the company's collapse broke on Christmas Day. 

It saw protests held by staff and RMT union members outside a number of City Link depots across the country. 

Jon Moulton said the directors of Better Capital, which owned the parcel delivery firm, were 'very sorry' about its collapse and the 'horrible effects' for its workforce.

Customers who have sent parcels and intended recipients are being advised that depots remain open for items to be picked up (file picture) 

The veteran venture capitalist claimed that taxpayers would not foot 'much of a bill' for redundancy payments for the firm's staff as City Link has 'paid a fortune' in taxes since Better Capital took it over in April 2013.

Administrators estimate that around 30,000 parcels are still being held at City Link's 53 depots around the country.

Customers who have sent parcels and intended recipients are being advised that depots remain open for items to be picked up between 8am and 8pm.

Ernst & Young said in a statement: 'The volume of parcels currently in the City Link network is low, and all depots will be open until approximately January 6.

'Customers and recipients can locate which depot their parcel is being held in using the City Link website.'
