Raiola told Le Parisien: 'Ligue 1 and PSG are not too small for Paul.

'All the big clubs are interesting to us, regardless of the league. We respect the leagues in France, Germany, England, Spain and Italy.

'Everyone thinks that Paul will leave Juventus, but that's not guaranteed.

'Everything depends on what Paul himself and Juventus want. If it's the moment to leave, then he will leave.'
