According to a new online poll, playing sick is a young thing.

The Future of Work Poll, which comes from University of Melbourne, measured how employed Australians view their work, and who is most likely to fake a sick day.

The study, which examined 1,035 Australian workers, and found that 43 per cent of workers aged 18-24 admitted to faking a sick day in the past 12 months.

The Future of Work Poll, which comes from University of Melbourne, measured how employed Australians view their work, and who is most likely to fake a sick day. 

Professor Peter Gahan, who directed the study, said the results have weighty implications for managers across the country.

'The people less likely to fake a sick day were workers over 45 years old or in executive and senior management positions. These more senior employees were also more likely to look forward to returning to work after their weekend,' Prof Gahan said.

The results also found that fulltime employees were more likely to fake a sickie than part-time workers, and generally less likely to feel optimistic about going into work on Monday.

'The results show that if you take a sickie, you're more likely to look forward to going to work on a Monday,' says Professor Gahan.

The results also found that fulltime employees were more likely to fake a sickie than part-time workers

'This may imply that people who take 'mental health days' feel more in control of their working life, and that those who work part-time are more enthusiastic about returning to work.'

The study also found that workplace leaders are much more likely than employees to look forward to work, with only nineteen percent of senior and executive managers suffering from 'Monday-it is 'compared to 42 percent of total employees.

A future poll, examining small and medium businesses will be released in February in the lead up to the Future of Work 2015 conference in April.
