A musician suspected of being a violent kidnapper has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act today after five police officers were allegedly mauled by his dog during a raid.

Pierre Robinson, 25, will appear in court this afternoon accused of 'allowing the dog to be dangerously out of control' outside a house in Albert Square, east London.

He is also accused of kidnapping and GBH with intent, relating to an incident on March 14 in Newham, police said.

Five policemen were in hospital last night after being savaged by the animal, and were said to have ‘life-changing’ wounds as serious as those seen after a shootout.

One officer had his arm broken between the animal’s jaws, while others had chunks of flesh torn from their legs and arms. Some will require plastic surgery, and one could lose several fingers.

A police marksman brought the carnage 
to an end when he blasted the dog four times with a shotgun after it was
cornered in the street.

Robinson now faces four charges at Thames Magistrates' Court, including possession of a pit bull dog, contrary to section one of the Dangerous Dogs Act.

The second allegation states he allowed his dog to be dangerously out of control in injuring five people.

He also faces the kidnapping and GBH with intent charges.

Scotland Yard has admitted it failed to pick up on intelligence that the animal lived at the property.

The 9am swoop was part of Operation Big Wing, a major Scotland Yard purge on wanted suspects across the capital.

The 48-hour operation saw hundreds of officers carrying out searches for people wanted by police or who had failed to appear at court.

Neighbours revealed they had reported 
the animal, described as a brown dobermann/pitbull cross called Poison,
to the council several times.

They said it was responsible for other
attacks, including one in which a builder was pulled from his bicycle 
and mauled so badly ‘it looked like he was being eaten alive’.

The attack took place on a residential
street in Stratford, east London, where patches of dried blood remain 
visible along a 30ft stretch of the road.

Witnesses said the dog ran 
free after a team searching for the man broke down the door of a terraced house.

Mobile phone footage taken by a 
passer-by shows the animal pouncing on one policeman and biting his arm.

The officer tries to fight the dog off by grabbing at its neck – but 
the animal is too strong.

At one point, it clamps its jaws so 
tightly around the man’s limb that it is lifted off the ground when he 
tries to shake it off.

A colleague is seen climbing on to a wall to 
escape the animal.

Residents in Albert Square, Newham, said the dog has attacked before - mauling a cyclist, last summer.

Pregnant Rehema Nyange said locals had repeatedly called Newham Council. But nothing was done.

‘When I saw it in the street, I 
would always run away. I was scared. There are people with children on 
this street and there's a school close by. It could easily have attacked
anybody,' she said.

I'm glad it's finally gone.’

Speaking about the attack she 
witnessed last September the 30-year-old said: ‘It attacked a guy as he 
rode his bicycle to work. The dog was running around the street. Then it got the man's leg. It bit him so bad.

‘It must have took a chunk out of 
it as when the paramedics came they had to cut his trousers off to get 
to it. It was a big wound.

‘He was crying like a baby but people were too scared to go out and help him in case the dog turned on them.’

A Newham Council spokesman said: 
'On 28 April 2011, the council investigated a complaint that a dog had 
bitten a cyclist in Albert Square.

'On 6 May 2011, the council's animal welfare officers conducted an initial visit to the property but there was no response.

'This case was discussed by police and the council in June 2011.

'As this is now subject to a criminal investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

The dog was finally cornered by a 
dozen officers who arrived from a nearby station armed with riot 
shields.

Colleagues from the Metropolitan Police’s CO19 armed unit then 
arrived and shot it.

Dennis Clarke, 71, said he called 
Newham Council three years ago to register his fears but was told 
officials could not do anything until the dog bit someone.

Describing 
the latest attack, he said: ‘The first I knew was when I heard someone 
yelling: “Help! Help!”

‘I came out my front door, and I could see the dog had the police officer’s leg and it wouldn’t let go. It was hanging off him.’

Student Gemma Smith, 27, added: ‘I 
woke up to screaming and I thought someone had been stabbed.’

She said 
officers told residents to go inside once they cornered the animal.

‘I 
heard gun shots. When I looked out of the window, the dog was shaking on
the ground.’

A police source said four of the five 
officers suffered ‘life-changing injuries’, and that one may need to 
have one or more fingers amputated.

‘They have suffered some really 
nasty injuries; broken bones, gashes that will need dozens of stitches 
and even plastic surgery,’ he said.

‘The injuries are as bad as being 
shot. It has taken out huge chunks of flesh.’

All five were said to be in a stable 
condition at the Royal London Hospital last night.

The Met confirmed last night a 
25-year-old man arrested at the scene was being questioned over the 
attack, who has now been named.

Newham Council confirmed it had 
investigated a complaint that the dog had attacked a cyclist last April,
and said the case was discussed with police in June.

An inquiry is 
under way to establish why officers did not know the dog was in the 
property.

Under
the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 (and as amended in 1997) it is illegal to 
own any Specially Controlled Dogs without specific exemption from a 
court.

The dogs have to be 
muzzled and kept on a lead in public, they must be registered and 
insured, neutered, and microchipped. The Act also bans the breeding, 
sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the Index of 
Exempted Dogs.

Four types in particular were identified by the Act:

The
Act also covers cross breeds of these dog. Dangerous dogs are 
classified by 'type', not by breed label. This means that whether a dog 
is prohibited will depend on its physical characteristics, and whether 
they match the description of a prohibited 'type'.
