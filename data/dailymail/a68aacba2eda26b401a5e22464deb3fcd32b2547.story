Spring came falling down Monday on winter-weary residents in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa with more than a foot of new snow in some areas.

The National Weather Service measured 15 inches of snow in Fennimore, Wisconsin, and 13 inches in neighboring Crawford County.

Decorah, Iowa, was dealing with 11.5 inches of snow, while ten inches fell in Rochester, Minnesota. 

A sprinkling of snow disrupted rush hour traffic in Chicago.

Schools in southwestern Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota canceled classes as snowplows hit the highways and streets and the locals fired up their snow blowers or brought out their shovels for another round. 

The accumulating snow stands in contrast to a week ago, when temperatures hit the 70s in some spots.

''We kind of feel like we're in a ghost town today. 

'It halts people walking around town. It just halts operations.'

The Illinois governor's motorcade was among the vehicles involved in scores of accidents Monday as the early spring storm caused near white-out conditions and slippery roads in northern Illinois.

Reports of crashes and spinouts started coming in after 5.30am, a State Police spokesman said. 

Some caused minor injuries, including to a state trooper traveling in Rauner's motorcade.

Police said one of the vehicles driven by a member of the State Police unit that protects the governor lost control on Interstate 55 near the Chicago suburb of Countryside around 8.15am and struck the rear tandem axle of a truck trailer. 

The driver was treated and released from a hospital.

More than 250 flights were canceled at O'Hare International Airport and more than 20 were canceled at Midway International Airport. 

Flights that were getting out were experiencing significant delays.

The mess should be short-lived.

Meteorologists said Tuesday's high temperatures were expected to be in the mid-40s, and that the Wednesday high could hit 63 degrees.

The snowstorm in northern Iowa has dampened Mason City's efforts to get a jump-start on spring cleaning.

City officials had rescheduled the town's first yard waste collection day of the year for Monday because of a recent bout of pleasant weather. 

But the storm that dumped about two inches of heavy snow in Mason City by early Monday left officials questioning their decision to switch their original April 6 start date.

Despite the weather, City Administrator Brent Trout told the Mason City Globe Gazette that the city did expect some yard waste to be picked up.
