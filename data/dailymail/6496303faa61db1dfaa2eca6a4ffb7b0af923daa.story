The body of an 87-year-old woman, who has been missing since her husband was found murdered at their Georgia home, was found in a lake today.

Shirley Dermond's body was discovered in Lake Oconee. After husband, Russell Dermond, was found dead on May 7, police feared she had been abducted. 

Mr Dermond, 88, was found decapitated in the garage of their $1 million Great Waters home, not far from where his wife was discovered.

Tragic find: Shirley Dermond's body was found in a lake on Friday afternoon. Police have been searching for her since May 7, when her husband, Russell, was found murdered in their $1 million home

Sources told 11 Alive that a fisherman had discovered the elderly woman's body near a dam on Friday afternoon,

Investigators said they still have no leads on the murder of Mr Dermond, and his head has still not been found.

They had offered a reward of up to $20,000 as police began an extensive search effort to try to find Mrs Dermond, and her husband's killer.

Investigators
 in Putnam County, Georgia, are completely baffled by the gruesome crime 
and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved 
elderly couple.

A coroner said Mr Dermond was dead before his head was removed, and had possibly been shot or struck with a large object.

His wife was never a suspect in the murder, and police believe she was abducted by the killer.

Nothing was taken from the couple's home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind.

Gruesome: Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found at the couple's exclusive lake-front home on May 7

Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman

Earlier this week officers began dredging a lakes and woods near the couple's home for clues.

One
 of the Dermonds' three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had 
been trying to come up with a possible motive, but they say their 
parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world.

Before his mother was found, 55-year-old Keith, from Jacksonville, Florida, told MailOnline: ‘We are 
completely devastated ...The 
thought of her suffering is just unbearable.

‘Each
 hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more 
resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never 
know what happened.

‘If
 she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The 
human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage 
where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering.

‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’

Russell Dermond was last seen on May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta.

Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party

Shirley
 Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no 
one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.  That same 
day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s 
Kentucky Derby party.

Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said financial and phone records 
have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target 
of criminal activity.

Sheriff 
Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was 
found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have 
been killed by mobsters.

He
 has also said there was no evidence that the brutal crime was in some 
way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone 
wrong in 2000.

Mark
 was shot in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine 
on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life 
imprisonment for murder.

He
 was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault 
and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a 
felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied.
