Graeme McDowell will sit out the Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston after becoming a father on Monday.

The Northern Irishman's wife Kristin underwent a planned cesarean and 35-year-old McDowell duly tweeted about his new arrival.

He wrote: 'Thanks so much for all the well wishes. Mum and baby girl are happy and healthy. Happiest moment of my life hands down. £daddy £love.'

All smiles: Graeme McDowell will miss the Deutsche Bank Championship after becoming a father on Monday

Having completed his final round at the BMW Championship on Sunday, McDowell told the Golf Channel: 'My caddie has been telling me all year 'You're not going to want to go to Boston', so I've decided to give myself the weekend off and just be with the family. Nice to be able to plan it that way.'

By missing Friday's Deutsche Bank, McDowell will not be able to advance his current FedEx Cup standing of 40th, while he also has a Ryder Cup slot to protect on the world points list.

Meanwhile, McDowell has announced he is leaving Horizon Sports Managements at the end of the 2014 season to look after his own commercial affairs.

His compatriot Rory McIlroy left Horizon last year and remains in dispute with the company.

No guarantee: McDowell cannot improve on 40th place in FedEx Cup and has not cemented a Ryder Cup spot

McDowell admitted before The Open that the row had 'been a strain on our relationship' but insisted he would happily renew his Ryder Cup pairing with McIlroy at Gleneagles next month.

Explaining his own departure from Horizon, he said: 'I am at a stage in my life where it feels right to move on to the next phase of my career - both in golf and business.

'I'm now involved with a growing number of exciting business ventures, many of which Horizon helped me establish, and as the landscape evolves so must I.'
