MPs will be banned from claiming expenses for dinners, TV licences and taxis before 11pm following the general election.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) confirmed that politicians' perks will be cut from May 8.

The move, which is likely to cause anger among MPs who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket, emerged as the watchdog announced a raft of changes for the next parliament.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has confirmed that certain perks for politicians will be cut from May 8 

Ipsa said: 'We will implement the rule changes agreed in December 2013, including removing hospitality claims and the late sitting food subsidy. We have tightened the rules on taxis and hotels after late sittings of the House.

'We will no longer allow claims, under the accommodation rules, for TV licences and home contents insurance.'

Elsewhere, staffing budgets are to go up 1 per cent to £147,000 for MPs in the London area, and £140,000 for those from outside the capital. 

The office costs budget is rising 0.5 per cent to reflect inflation, but accommodation budgets have been frozen.

The watchdog had proposed a raft of curbs to expenses in 2013 as part of a wider package that included salaries rising by 10 per cent from £67,000 to £74,000.

It suggested that trimming perks and pension benefits would offset the costs of the controversial pay rise. 

Prime Minister David Cameron has said that a 10 per cent pay rise for MPs is 'unacceptable' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent

The changes will go ahead even though the pay rise is still subject to review and David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signalled they may block it.

Mr Cameron has said he regards the hike as 'unacceptable' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent, while Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg have said they do not believe it should go ahead.

The move - which is likely to cause anger among MPs who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket - emerged as Ipsa announced expenses rules for the next parliament.

But while the expenses reductions will now come in to force automatically on May 8, the MP salary boost will be subject to a review due to be carried out in the weeks after the poll.

The watchdog theoretically has the final decision on the issue - although there have been suggestions that the law could be changed in order to prevent the increase.

The cross-party Commons Standards Committee has previously condemned the expenses cuts, arguing that the rules are already 'considerably less generous' than in many companies.

Highlighting the plan to drop the £15 currently claimable for dinner when the House sits beyond 7.30pm, the committee said: 'If such expenses are not met by the employer, then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places.

'The rules for MPs are already considerably less generous than this.

'We also note that when there is whipped business, members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies.

'Once again, we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves, unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses.'

The committee said MPs routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week and the tightening of the expenses system in the wake of the scandal that rocked Westminster already meant some had taken to sleeping in their offices.

'We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses,' the report said.

The changes will see a halt to claims for tea and biscuits, and hotels only allowed if they are booked after 1am.
