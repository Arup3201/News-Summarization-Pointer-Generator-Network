It is not the only example of Chinese authorities pushing ahead with building projects before all obstacles are out of the way.

Residents have been pushed out of their homes by builders digging moats around their properties and ripping out their staircases.

But in the case of this part-demolished Taiyuan car park, it is a driver who has been backed into an impossible corner.

The lone car is parked in a bay, surrounded by the debris of the flattened car park.

It is said that the car park in Taiyuan, Shanxi was scrapped as part of a street-broadening project.

Stranded: The parking bad is perfectly intact, but the piles of rubble surrounding the car mean it will have to be removed with a crane

Strange sight: A woman and baby survey the bizarre view. The car is facing a row of shops and is though to be owned by someone working for a local company

The site was used as for parking by a local company.

Builders went ahead with demolishing 
the area after waiting for the car to be moved for ten days. When the 
owner failed to return to the car, workers were told they couldn't wait 
any longer.

The bizarre sight of the white 
vehicle stranded in a sea of stone has stopped passers-by in their 
tracks. The piles of rubble and large chunks of concrete leave no clear 
path for the car to be driven out.

It is not known whether drivers were 
informed of when the car park was to be flattened, but the owner of this
vehicle seems to be none-the-wiser.

It would take a Houdini-esque effort to escape this jam without the help of a crane.

Many Chinese development projects have forced residents to vacate their homes, by starting work before they have moved out.

What
was a predominantly rural country is undergoing massive change with a 
building boom that has seen half of China's enormous 1.3 billion 
population already urbanised, according to official statistics.

Developers of an office block in Yangji, Guangdong province, got fed up with negotiating 
with local home so they diverted a local 
river to encircles the residents.

Anyone in there?: A security guard peers into the abandoned car. its owner had not claimed it in the 10 days before the demolition. Builders were ordered to go ahead with their work as the project couldn't be delayed further

Surrounded: An elderly couple refused to leave their home in Wenling,despite plans for a road to be built. Developers went ahead and built to motorway around the property

Room with a view: With space a t apremium in the densely populated city of Zhuzhou in China's Hunan province, homeowners decided to build these villas on the roof of the Jiutian International Plaza shopping centre

Afterthought: Developers forgot to build an underground car park with this block of flats. Builders started digging down once the apartments were completed

On the horizon: This 328m skyscraper in Huaxi, Jiangsy province, dwarfs everything around it. It was built in a village of 2,000 farmers and its closet rival is 600 miles away in Beijing
