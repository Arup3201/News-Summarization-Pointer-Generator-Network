Second time around: A judge has issued an order for Austin Clem, 25, to be resentenced

A judge under fire for sparing a triple rapist prison time has agreed to reconsider the sentence.

Alabama Circuit Judge James Woodroof filed an order on Tuesday for 25-year-old Austin Smith Clem to be resentenced.

Clem was convicted this month of raping a teenage girl three times, but the judge suspended his 40-year prison sentence in favor of a community corrections program that allowed him to skip incarceration.

The decision sparked a national outcry, with the victim Courtney Andrews saying she was 'livid' and 'baffled'.

Andrews, now 20, told MSNBC she was grateful her attacker would be resentenced, but was not hopeful.

The judge was a childhood friend of the perpetrator’s attorney, Dan Totten.

'It’s hard for me to put a lot of hope in it, because I don’t want to be let down again. I thought he was going to get prison time before and he didn’t,' Andrews said. 

A jury in September convicted Clem on
three counts of rape in a series of sexual assaults on his neighbor and 
one-time family friend.

Andrews testified that Clem sexually abused her at age 13 and then again when she was 14 and 18.

The defense argued there was no evidence of assault and characterized the victim as a 'scorned woman.'

Victim: Courtney Andrews has taken the unconventional step of publicly identifying herself and slamming her attacker's sentence

Clem
could have faced decades behind bars.

Instead, Limestone County Circuit 
Judge Woodroof sentenced Clem to spend two 
years with a community-based corrections program that will allow him to 
continue working and living at home, plus spend three years on 
supervised probation.

He 
was ordered to pay $1,631 in restitution, to stay away from the victim 
and her family, to register as a sex offender, and to complete 
counseling. The judge did not explain his decision in his order.

Limestone
County District Attorney Brian Jones filed papers last week 
asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to intervene in Clem's case.

Convicted: Clem could face prison time when he is resentenced

Jones also asked a judge to delay the no-prison sentence and temporarily incarcerate Clem.

A
petition filed with the appeals court argues the lenient sentence was 
illegal under state law because Clem was convicted of first-degree rape 
and two counts of second-degree rape.

Clem
should have been sentenced to at least three years in prison under the 
type of sentence the judge ordered, the prosecutor argued.
