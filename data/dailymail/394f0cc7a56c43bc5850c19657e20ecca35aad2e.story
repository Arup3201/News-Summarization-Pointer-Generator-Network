An international AIDS conference opened in Australia on Sunday with a tribute to several delegates who were killed en route to the gathering when their plane was shot down over Ukraine.

Officials at the opening ceremony for the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne held a moment of silence for the six AIDS researchers and activists killed aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.

All 298 people on board the plane died when it was shot down by a surface-to-air missile Thursday as it flew over rebel-held eastern Ukraine.

Among the passengers was prominent Dutch researcher Joep Lange, former president of the International AIDS Society, and his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren.

Also lost was Pim de Kuijer, of the organisation STOP AIDS NOW!, Lucie van Mens and Maria Adriana de Schutter of AIDS Action Europe, and Glenn Thomas of the World Health Organisation.

Around 12,000 scientists and activists from 200 countries are attending the conference to discuss the latest developments in HIV and AIDS research.

The president of the International Aids Society, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, dedicated the conference to those who were killed, and a candlelight vigil will be held on Tuesday to commemorate their lives. Condolence books were also being passed around for attendees to sign.

'It's a really important time for what we think everyone needs, which is a space to grieve and to respect the six members of our community that died on MH17,' conference co-chair Sharon Lewin said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott also expressed his deep condolences to the colleagues and friends of the six HIV researchers and lobbyists who died on their way to the conference.

'Australians share with you the pain you feel as this conference commences,' Mr Abbott said via a video message at the opening ceremony of the 20th International AIDS Conference on Sunday.

'The terrible circumstances surrounding the loss of MH17 are a challenge to us all.

'298 men, women and children are no longer with us and their passing defies our sense of justice.

'We honour all who have died.'

Mr Abbott also highlighted the death of AIDS humanitarian Jonathan Mann, who died in a plane crash on the way to an AIDS conference in 1998.

'Another world leader in the fight against AIDS, Dr Jonathan Mann, who also died in a plane crash, said when speaking of his work - and your work - 'we will prevail together - for we will refuse to be split'.

'We will prevail together'.

He urged everyone 'to rededicate ourselves to the work of those who were lost'.

Mr Abbott was unable to travel to Melbourne due to commitments in Canberra as part of the federal government's response to the tragedy, including a meeting of National Security Committee of Cabinet.

Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss attended the opening ceremony in place of Mr Abbott.
