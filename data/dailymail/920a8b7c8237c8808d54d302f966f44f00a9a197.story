An advertising agency has caused outrage after creating a promotion for a mattress company which depicts schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai being shot in the face.

The advert shows Malala, who was 14 when she was shot by a Taliban extremist, falling backwards covered in blood, being attached to a drip and then 'bouncing back' to receive an award.

A staff member at global firm Ogilvy & Mather initially defended the advert as a tribute - but the firm has now apologised and launched an investigation after it was blasted as wildly insensitive.

'Distasteful': The advert was produced by ad agency Ogilvy and features Malala Yousafzai being shot aged 14

Heroine: Now 16, the schoolgirl has become a figurehead for women's rights around the world

Indian bedding company Kurl-On commissioned a series of three poster adverts from the Indian branch of the design agency, which was founded by British David Ogilvy in 1948.

The other two ads in the series show Gandhi leaving his career as a barrister to become a peace activist, and Steve Jobs bouncing back after he was kicked out of Apple.

A person claiming to be a representative of Ogilvy, posting on the Ads of the World website, initially wrote: 'We do not believe that getting shot in the face was the defining moment in this brave young 14-year-old’s life - it was her courage and determination to rise from hopeless circumstances.

'We believe that her’s is a breathtakingly inspiring story and while all of us do not have the raw courage or moral fiber to do what she did, we can try to pay a tribute to her by any means available to us.

'In this case, the means happened to be an advertising campaign. If we were architects, we would erect a monument in her honor.'

But the advert was savaged by industry experts, including Canadian executive Tom Megginson.

He wrote on his blog: '14-year-olds getting shot in the face by terrorists are appropriate content for mattress ads now?

'I am ashamed to be in the same industry as these ad people.'

The advert has now been removed from the Ads of the World website, while the firm behind it has apologised and launched a probe into what it said was a breach of standards.

'We deeply regret this incident and want to
 personally apologise to Malala Yousafzai and her family. We are 
investigating how our standards were compromised in this case and will 
take whatever corrective action is necessary'

Ogilvy & Mather's India spokesman Greg Carton said: 'The recent Kurl-On ads from our India 
office are contrary to the beliefs and professional standards of Ogilvy 
& Mather and our clients.

'We deeply regret this incident and want to
 personally apologise to Malala Yousafzai and her family.

'We are 
investigating how our standards were compromised in this case and will 
take whatever corrective action is necessary.

'In addition, we have 
launched a thorough review of our approval and oversight processes 
across our global network to help ensure that our standards are never 
compromised again.'

He added: 'This was a paid client campaign and only the Steve Jobs piece ran in a
 local newspaper in India a few weeks ago.

'The Malala piece has never 
been in paid media - nor will it be.'

Malala’s representatives said the advert was 'distasteful', but declined to comment further.

One Twitter user, @juelzkeyte, said: 'Just had to pick my jaw off my desk at the news Malala Yousafzai's image is being used for a mattress advert. Beyond words.'

She added: 'I just don't even know where to begin with this. Utterly utterly abhorrent. I could scream.'

The advert is only the latest in a long line to cause offence so far this year.

This week a 'lewd' Danish advert was criticised for trying literally to 'sex up' the European elections with a bare-chested hero called Voteman, who was depicted in bed with five women before punching non-voters in the face.

In March a billboard in Las Vegas advertising an Asian bistro with a woman's naked back and the words 'always a happy ending' was slammed for using 'insulting' stereotypes.

Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, meanwhile, provoked outrage by taking bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial’s outcome and offering to refund punters if he was cleared.

And in January a 'degrading' advertisement depicting a beef patty sandwiched between a woman's buttocks, proclaiming 'the freshest fun between the buns', was banned in Australia.

Other comments on Twitter included 'that's just sick', 'so, so, so appalling' and 'can't believe someone thought this was okay'.

Pakistani-born Malala was shot in the face on a school bus by an extremist Taliban gunman because she wanted to receive an education, in a horrific crime that shocked the world.

Malala, now 16, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where she recovered from her injuries.

The young girl has since released her autobiography, and has received a string of humanitarian awards for her continued activism, including a Nobel Peace Prize nomination.

Kurl-On claim to the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of mattresses and beds, and export their products to several countries including Britain.

It is not known whether the mattress firm approved the design.

Several Kurl-On representatives did not immediately return requests for comment.

A spokesman for the British Advertising Standards Authority said he could not say whether the advert would be against its guidelines unless it was used in Britain and received complaints.

'The codes are very strict and say adverts should not contain anything which would cause serious or widespread offence,' he added.
