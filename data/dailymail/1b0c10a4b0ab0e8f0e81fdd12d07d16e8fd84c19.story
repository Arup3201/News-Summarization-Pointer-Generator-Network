The number of pets being put down in animal shelters across the U.S. has declined dramatically in the past four decades.

According to the Humane Society of the United States, the number of dogs and cats being euthanized today is about one-fifth of what it was in the 1970s.

That's even as the number of pets in the country is booming from 64 million to 160 million over the same time period.

'They were euthanizing about 15 million pets back in 1970,' Betsy McFarland, vice president of companion animals at the Humane Society of the United States told Fox News.

'We’re now down to about three million every year. Of course, that’s three million too many. But that is tremendous progress that’s been made over the last four decades.'

Broad grassroots spay and neuter campaigns have also helped to reduce the number of unwanted pets.

McFarland says a major part of the reduction is societal attitudes towards pets.

'I mean pets are really considered part of the family,' McFarland told Fox News.

'And that has been a shift over the many decades where maybe pets were a little more utilitarian.'

Another factor is better coordination among animal welfare organizations to try and keep animals out of shelters.

Changing attitudes: People now think of animals as a part of their family, rather than something more utilitarian, says McFarland

Although the number of pets entering shelters has fallen, 50 per cent that do enter are euthanized.

Fox News reports that in the Atlanta area, a non-profit organization called LifeLine Animal Project is seeking to help both pet owners and animal shelters.

'What we found was that so many of the calls from the people who wanted to surrender their pets, they didn’t actually want to surrender their pets,' Debbie Setzer, LifeLine’s community outreach director, told Fox News.

'They may have had some financial hardship where they couldn’t afford dog food. They may have had a fence complaint where the dog was getting out.'

LifeLine will help pet owners in any way they can to keep the animal out of the shelter, from providing donated pet food to mending fences.

The organization has also helped shelters to reduce their euthanasia rates by organizing pet drives in shopping malls and other high-traffic areas.
