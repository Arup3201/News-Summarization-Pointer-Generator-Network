Theresa May has admitted she has ¿grave¿ concerns about fraud in the student visa system

Theresa May has admitted she has ‘grave’ concerns about fraud in the student visa system, which allows 200,000 foreigners into Britain each year.

The Home Secretary said despite Government efforts to crack down on visa abuse, applicants were ‘finding other ways around the system’.

Mrs May made her comments after she was confronted with evidence from a BBC Panorama investigation exposing rampant fraud in the student visa system.

The programme exposed widespread abuse, including language tests at ‘trusted’ colleges taken by fluent English speakers, and multiple choice tests in which answers were read out by the invigilators.

It also revealed a network of criminal immigration agents providing, for a fee, any document required to get around Home Office checks.

Consultants offered undercover reporters a guaranteed pass in an English language test for £500 and a bank statement showing they had enough money to support themselves for £250.

They were also offered an ‘all in’ package of everything needed for a visa for £2,800.

One lawyer told the programme the student visa system was now a criminal ‘free for all’. 

Mrs May said the government had done a huge amount to tackle fraud, but admitted there was still abuse in the system. She told the programme: ‘The numbers of student visas have gone down and the amount of abuse has gone down.

‘But it’s clear that people are finding other ways around the system.’

She added: ‘In the immigration world you can never say you’ve done everything, you always have to look because people will look for the new way round the system. 

‘I have known there is abuse of the system but well done for uncovering the further abuse that is taking place. 

‘What you have shown is that people effectively go in to a situation where [the entry requirements] are being faked for them and that is a matter of grave concern.’ 

‘We now have to look at the sort of documents people are providing and look at the kind of scams being undertaken behind that.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable oppose new restrictions while Yvette Cooper said the investigation showed Theresa May is presiding over a failing immigration system

Under the coalition, more than 700 colleges have been banned from bringing students in to the country from outside the EU.

New tests, including English language and means testing, have been introduced to try and stop bogus students coming to Britain to work.

The programme will prompt further calls for tighter controls on the student visa system.

But there is significant opposition to new controls from the education sector, which makes millions every year from the 200,000 foreign students entering the country.

Another 100,000 students already here have their visas extended.

Liberal Democrats, including Business Secretary Vince Cable, oppose new restrictions, saying they act as a block on genuine students.

Last year it emerged there may be up to 90,000 foreign students living in Britain illegally.

Audits by universities and colleges threw up tens of thousands of students accused of breaking the rules by failing to attend their courses or even register.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This investigation shows Theresa May is presiding over a failing immigration system which too often focuses on the wrong thing and where illegal immigration is a growing problem.

The danger of having such a weak system which is so easily and brazenly exploited is that it is unfair, undermines public confidence – and also makes it harder to maintain support for the graduate migration we need.’ 

The English tests seen in the report – said by Panorama to be run by company ETS – have since been suspended by the Home Office.

Mrs May said: ‘This type of abuse is not acceptable and we will continue to clamp down. We have taken action and suspended the two colleges identified in the programme. 

‘Applications made by students in the UK using the English Testing Service or associated with the colleges or immigration advisers mentioned in the programme have been put on hold pending the outcome of those investigations.

‘All further English language tests done through ETS in the UK have been suspended.’
