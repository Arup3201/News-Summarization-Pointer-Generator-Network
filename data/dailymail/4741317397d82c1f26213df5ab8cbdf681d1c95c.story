American Airlines has rolled out a new pilot program designed to ease passenger congestion in the aisles - and collect more profits - as flights prepare for takeoff.

Under the trial at just a few airports in the U.S., you can get onto the plane and in your seat ahead of other passengers regardless of where your row is - as long as you travel light.

Travel expert John Discala says that after first class passengers are asked to board, the plane is then open to those who are flying without a carry-on bag.

No bag, no problem: Under the trial at just a few U.S. airports, passengers can get onto the plane ahead of others regardless of their row - as long as they travel without a carry-on

Tale of the tweet: John Discala was the first to report the trial after he witnessed it firsthand at an adjacent gate

Discala, the host of The Travel Channel's Hot Spots 2012, first reported on the change after he happened to witness the program in action as he waited for a flight at an adjacent gate.

Taking to Twitter on March 16, Discala posted: 'I wonder if @AmericanAir is testing out a new boarding procedure. They just invited those without carry-on's to board 2nd.'

Less congestion: Allowing passengers without carry-ons to board first may lead to less passengers lined up for the overhead bins

American tweeted back: 'We know that the
 WAS airports were trying a new boarding system, John, but we hadn't 
heard that FLL (Fort Lauderdale) was too. Enjoy your flight!'

Discala said that passengers on the Chicago-bound flight were allowed to board first if they had laptop bags or purses, as long as it wasn't a carry-on to stash in the overhead bin.

He says that if put into normal practice, the benefits could be two-fold.

He told ABC News that the unconventional boarding could speed up the process of getting customers on the plane.

Secondly, he said, it may coax customers into skipping the line by checking their bag - and paying the accompanying fee to boost the airline's profits.

The airline told ABC News: American Airlines said, 'We test many different concepts in an effort to continually improve the customer experience.Â 

'With this in mind, we're conducting a test for a boarding process whereby customers who do not have any baggage to stow in the overhead compartment will be boarded in a separate group.

The air carrier added: 'This is a limited test and results are still being analyzed. Given that it's a limited test, the airports and flights chosen may change at any time.'
