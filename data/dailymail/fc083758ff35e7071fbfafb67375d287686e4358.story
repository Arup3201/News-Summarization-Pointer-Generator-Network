Conder residents were evacuated from their homes on Saturday after a pipe-bomb and various other weapons were discovered inside a pinball machine within a nearby home

A man has been charged after police seized illegal weapons including sawn-off guns and a pipe bomb hidden inside a pinball machine in his Canberra home.

The bomb squad was called to the 26-year-old man's house in Conder, south Canberra, on Saturday and residents were evacuated while the AFP Bomb Team cleared the house of the pipe bomb.

A police detector dog sniffed out the weapons and explosives wrapped in blankets and plastic bags and hidden inside the 1970s vintage arcade game.

Members from Tuggeranong and Woden Criminal Investigations acted on a tip-off that the man was in possession of illicit firearms and executed a search warrant at the house.

The weapons included a sawn-off double barrel shotgun, a sawn-off .22 rifle along with ammunition, a crossbow and the improvised explosive device.

A 26-year-old man will be attend the ACT Magistrates Court at a later date charged with offences relating to the seized items.

Police urge anyone with information on illicit firearms to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or via act.crimestoppers.com.au. Information can be provided anonymously.
