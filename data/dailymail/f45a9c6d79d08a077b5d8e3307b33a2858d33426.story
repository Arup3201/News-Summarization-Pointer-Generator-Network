Bastian Schweinsteiger has issued an apology to Borussia Dortmund after being caught singing a rude song about the club.

The Bayern Munich midfielder led an anti-chant about their fierce rivals where he was recorded singing: 'BVB, sons of b******s' at a party.

The 29-year-old has since released an apology from his official Facebook page after the video went viral.

'Hello, I'm sending you all a message from my holidays, as it's come to my attention that a video of me has found its way onto the internet,' Germany's World Cup winner said.

'I'd like to say sorry to all fans, players and officials at Borussia Dortmund.

'I won't try to play this down - it's obviously a well known fan song, but I didn't want to insult anyone with the offensive word.

'It's important for me to articulate that now. I get on with all Dortmund players really well, especially Kevin Grosskreutz.

'It was an unhappy situation, so sorry again to all Dortmunders, I hope the fans will understand it. All the best, I hope everything's ok again. Your Basti.'

Despite the apology, the video of Schweinsteiger's anti-Dortmund chant should only serve to intensify the rivalry between the clubs, who have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them.
