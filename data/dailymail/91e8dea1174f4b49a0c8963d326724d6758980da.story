Lumpy legs: Debbie's liposuction didn't go to plan

A woman who wanted to celebrate her 40th birthday by treating herself to liposuction was left with unsightly, lumpy legs.

Debbie, now 47, had to live with the effects of her botched surgery for seven years.

She had hoped to get perfect thighs but instead was forced to constantly keep her legs covered up and as a result suffered from low self-esteem.

Now the married driving instructor has appeared on TV show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if they can help her.

She admitted she regretted having the cosmetic treatment which sucks fat from the body. She said: 'It's not what I wanted or asked for. If I could turn back the clock I would not do it. I've been left with craters and grooves in my legs.'

Debbie returned to the surgeon who botched the op leaving her with dented thighs instead of smooth skin. But he assured her nothing was wrong.

'I was told it was just swelling and it would go down with time.I believed him, why wouldn't I?' she said.

Plastic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh, who operates from his clinics in London, Birmingham, Worcester and Herefordshire, was shocked by the state of Debbie's legs when he examined her for the TLC TV show. He speculated on what had gone wrong to leave her with much unsightly legs pitted with craters.

He said: 'Has this surgeon just taken out too much fat? Or has Debbie had a bleed in there or has something else gone on to allow the fat to die?'

Ironically, Dr Vijh said the solution was
 for Debbie to have more fat put back into her thighs to smooth out the 
holes. He added that botched lipo was a 'nightmare' to fix but he would 
'give it a go'.

Embarrassed on the beach: The driving instructor was left with lines, left, and craters, right, in her thighs that made her feel self-conscious if her legs were ever on show

Debbie said she was prepared to go back under the knife and have fat pumped into her legs if it would help. 'I'd much rather that than stay as I am now,' she admitted.

The cameras followed Debbie into the operating theatre where Dr Vijh discovered the last surgeon had left her body with 'lots of scarring and complications' that was causing the dents in her skin.

By inserting small bits of fat throughout her thighs, he was able to smooth her skin out again.

After the surgery, Debbie admitted she was 'really pleased with the result'.

Smooth again: A second op to repair the damage has left Debbie full or confidence and happy with the appearance of her legs

Dr Vijh explained: 'It's the way it should have been done the with first time around with no lumps or bumps.'

Debbie added: 'I feel more confident now. I can wear a bikini again and not worry about what people are thinking if they see me on the beach.

'Now I know people are looking at my legs
 because they look good, not because they have craters in them. I'm 
looking forward to my next beach holiday and I'll now be leaping around in my hot pants all over the place!'

Extreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC Thursdays at 8pm
