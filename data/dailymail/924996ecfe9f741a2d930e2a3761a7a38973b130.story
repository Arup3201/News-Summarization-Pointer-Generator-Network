The report by estate agents Savills 
and and analysts Property Database will give hope that a house price 
boom has returned to many areas of the country after the market was hit 
by recession.

And the 
research has suggested that rising prices in the South East are having a
 positive knock-on effect in other parts of the country.

Further afield, areas of Cornwall,
 Cumbria and Pembrokeshire have seen average prices double in the last 
10 years, showing that economic growth is not restricted to London and 
the South East alone.

The report, The Most Expensive Housing Markets of England and Wales, analysed Land Registry data for last year's house sales in 200 electoral wards across England and Wales, and focused on the 25 most expensive areas in eight regions of the country.

'There are now very real magnets of wealth beyond the capital,' Lucian Cook, the head of research for Savills and the author of the report told The Sunday Telegraph. 'A lot 
  of areas have yet to feel the London ripple effect, so we expect to see them 
  performing very strongly in the year ahead. We are already seeing this in 
  the inner commuter ring.'

The Office of Budget Responsibility has predicted that by 2018 house prices will have risen by 27per cent, meaning more areas could see average prices hit the £1million mark.

However, concerns have been raised over prices being pushed up by a shortage of houses and fears that rising prices will make life increasingly difficult for first time buyers to get on the property ladder.

'This means there isn’t much to buy. It keeps transaction levels down and pushes prices up,' said Mark Hayward, the managing director of the National Association of Estate Agents.
