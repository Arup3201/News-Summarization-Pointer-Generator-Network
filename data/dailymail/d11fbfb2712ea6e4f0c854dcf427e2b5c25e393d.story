She's just one month old but it seems you're never to young to attend the races - certainly not if your name happens to be Mia Tindall.

The baby daughter of Zara Phillips made her first public appearance at the Barbury point-to-point races in Wiltshire, where two of her mother's horses were competing.

And both seemed to be enjoying the glorious sunny weather as they picked their way across the course, Mia safe in her practical black pram.

Zara, 32, also plumped for a characteristically practical look and wrapped up warmly in a cosy blue padded jacket and a pair of sturdy brown boots.

Zara looked fresh-faced and healthy and beamed broadly as she watched the racing action unfold.

Although rugby player husband Mike Tindall was nowhere to be seen, the royal wasn't short of company and was seen laughing and joking with friends during gaps in the programme.

Admirers: She's less than a month old but little Mia seems to have plenty of fans already

All OK? Zara takes a peek at her tiny sleeping daughter to make sure everything is OK

Zara, who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer, had three horses entered for the event, among them, the hotly tipped Devils Boy [sic].

Other entries included Calusa Comet, a six-year-old Irish bay, and Fiddle Faddle, a horse owned by her mother, The Princess Royal.

But although her horses, as always, took up much of her time, the new mother was spotted peeping into the pram to check on her sleeping daughter at regular intervals.

While she won't be ready to ride in a point-to-point of her own for a few years, if Zara is anything to go by, it probably won't be long before little Mia starts showing a passion for horses of her own.

Cheerful: Zara seemed on good form

Just the two of us: Mia's father, rugby player Mike Tindall, was nowhere to be seen

Off we go: Zara's practical choice of pushchair seemed to cope with the rugged grass racecourse
