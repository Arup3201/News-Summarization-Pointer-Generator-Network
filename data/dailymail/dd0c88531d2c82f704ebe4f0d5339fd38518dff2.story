Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has warned Manchester United they can't afford his best players and claimed the likes of Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller don't want to leave for the Barclays Premier League anyway.

United manager Louis van Gaal had the three Bayern stars on his initial hit list at Old Trafford but summer moves for the trio never really got off the ground.

Asked this afternoon if he had to say no to Van Gaal, Guardiola nodded and said: 'They [United] didn't have enough money.

Asked for his views on United’s failure to play in the Champions League this season, Guardiola added: 'It’s a good lesson for the big clubs.

'They think: ‘We are unbeatable and strong’ and they are not here. Maybe the next season they are out.

'That’s why football is magnificent.
