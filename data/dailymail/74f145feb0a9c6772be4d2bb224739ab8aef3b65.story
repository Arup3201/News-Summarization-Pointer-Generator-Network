A dog that had been missing for two weeks after running away from a New York home hit hard by Hurricane Sandy was found just in time.

Buster, a Rhodesian Ridgeback and German Shepard mix, was on a list to be euthanized in less than 24 hours when his owner Christine O’Donovan, of Belle Harbor, Queens, spotted his photo online.

‘I looked at the photo and knew it was him,’ said O’Donovan, who saw her dog on the city’s Animal Care & Control’s nightly euthanasia list on December 13 and went with her children to bring Buster back home the next morning.

The young and healthy 63-pound mutt had run away from home two weeks earlier while workers were assessing damage brought on by Sandy, the New York Daily News reported.

During those weeks, O’Donovan, 42, and her five kids, ages 2 to 12, had been searching their devastated neighborhood for any signs of their missing dog.

Without electricity or an Internet connection due to the storm O’Donovan said she was unable to access the AC&C’s lost and found database or go to the shelter to look for Buster, who she had rescued a few months earlier after finding him tied to a pole on Queens Boulevard.

Buster was listed on the AC&C’s website as a stray pit bull mix with a medical condition of ‘kennel cough.’

O’Donovan immediately called the shelter to put Buster’s impending euthanasia on hold using the shelter’s automated telephone system.

‘I hoped and prayed that he would be alive when we got there,’ she said.

Sure enough he was.

‘He was so happy to see my kids and they were so happy to see him,’ said O’Donovan.

The mother of five also left the shelter with a brindle pit bull puppy, named Niko, whose owner was dropping him off when she got there.

Niko is up for adoption or foster through the animal rescue group Sasha’s Mission, which has an active Facebook page.

Buster was among dozens of other domesticated animals from areas hit by Hurricane Sandy to wind up at animal shelters within recent weeks.

More than 50 lost dogs and cats that landed at AC&C shelters in neighborhoods impacted by the storm were sent to an ASPCA Emergency Boarding Facility so that their owners could have a better chance of finding them.

AC&C spokesperson Richard Gentles said Buster did not slip through the system.

‘The dog was held for eight days without identification. The mandatory stray hold is 72 hours from intake,’ he told the Daily News.
