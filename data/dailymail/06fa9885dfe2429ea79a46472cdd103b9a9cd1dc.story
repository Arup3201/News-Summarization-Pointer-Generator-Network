It looks like the Today show's change of scenery is getting to be too much for the Richard Wilkins famously pert head of hair.

The entertainment reporter's mane is normally well-tamed and artfully coiffed, giving off the air of a casual yet skilful mastery of the mane.

Having a full head of hair is an achievement for any man, a fact which doesn't escape Wilkins, who is normally vigilant about the appearance and maintenance of his tresses.

However, it looks like the United States is holding one over Richard 'Dickie' Wilkins, as the TV personality appeared a little worse for wear and more than a little tousled by the change of hemisphere during every live crossover last week.

Having too much fun to worry about his hair? Dickie and Richard have a laugh in the US

Appearing alongside Australia's most flamboyant American adoptee Richard Reid, every on-location spot for the Today show this week has revealed a side (or side part) few have seen of Dickie before.

However, it's not the first time Richard Wilkins has faced a bad hair day. 

Last year co-host Karl Stefanovic declared Dickie's nebulously hovering hair 'wild' and insinuated the veteran of Aussie TV had been drinking the night before.

While Dickie might have called the description 'a bit rough', the same could be said for the appearance of his hair throughout the week. 

His enigmatic hairstyle may not be as impervious to the elements as once thought, and may prove that Dickie is only human after all.
