Spain have been ordered to make a new kit for the World Cup after FIFA decided the team’s normal red shirts didn’t offer enough contrast to the Holland jersey.

Spain’s clothing supplier Adidas said Thursday that 'FIFA has expressly mandated' it to supply Spain with a third - white - kit that it must use in its first match in Brazil.

FIFA requires teams to have two different kits for the tournament - one light in color and the other dark. 

Spain’s strip is red for home and black for away, while the Dutch - who normally wear orange - have a blue away kit they plan to wear against Spain when the two sides meet in Group B on June 13.
