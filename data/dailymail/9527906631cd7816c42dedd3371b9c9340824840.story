Money cannot buy love - but it seems many feel it can buy a friendship.

A study found UK adults have spent on average £158 on gifts for their closest friend in the last year.

The survey by the Post Office found half of Britons worry about the cost of their friendships.

It is perhaps understandable when the cost of buying Christmas and birthday gifts for a best friend over a lifetime adds up to £6,800.

It showed a sixth of adults use their overdraft to buy a friend a present, while a quarter have lied about being busy to avoid the expense of celebrating with friends.

Meanwhile, half have had concerns about the impact buying a friend’s present will have on their finances.

On average, we spend £62 on Christmas presents and £47 on birthday gifts for our closest friend.

One in seven people spend more than £100 on their friend’s Christmas present.

When a best friend has children, the costs become even higher – with us spending an additional £53 annually on gifts for our best friend’s brood.

The vast majority of adults said they did not save up in advance to cover the costs.

John Willcock, head of current cccounts at Post Office said: ‘The cost of being a good friend can really add up, but most of us think it is worth it.

‘However no friend would want you to get into debt on their behalf and sometimes we need to honest when our budgets are tight.’

A friend’s impending nuptials can also be expensive with the average Briton splashing £62 on an engagement party and present and £70 on a stag or hen do.
