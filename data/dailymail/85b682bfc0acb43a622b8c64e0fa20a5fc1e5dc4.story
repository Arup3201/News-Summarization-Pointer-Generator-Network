Postmen have been ordered to boycott homes on 'unmade roads' because of health and safety fears.

Householders in Benfleet, Essex, received the news that they would no longer be receiving mail on Saturday - in the post.

The notification letters said the uneven road surfaces presented an 'unacceptable risk' and this was their last delivery.

Royal Mail bosses are worried that postmen could fall off their bikes.

Non-delivery: Postmen in Essex have been ordered to boycott homes on 'unmade roads', such as Catherine Road (pictured) because of health and safety fears

The move means some residents must make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office.

Doreen and Meredith Chatterton, aged 88 and 89, of Catherine Road in Benfleet are among those who have been told that the post they received on Saturday was their last.

Mrs Chatterton said: 'Royal Mail has said it's not delivering any mail at all to the unmade roads, and there's quite a lot in this area.

'We all had the letter from Royal Mail on Saturday and it starts now so we didn't even get any warning.'

The letter stated there had been 'on several occasions a number of near miss accidents' which prompted a health and safety review that found an 'unacceptable risk' for delivery to homes on unmade roads.

But the couple have lived on the road since 1969 and said it had never been a problem before.

Mrs Chatterton said: 'What they could do is park in Clarence Road and walk a couple of minutes down the footpath. That's how they used to deliver the mail in the old days.'

Mrs Chatterton said they would now be forced to travel 25 minutes each way to the sorting office to collect their post.

She said: 'We don't want to be doing that every day, especially with winter coming.'

John Baxter, 66, who also lives on Catherine Road, said: 'The letter arrived on Saturday and said this is your last post. All of a sudden they've brought in these changes overnight.

'It's got to be a cost-cutting measure and taking vans off the route and someone's going to lose their job.'

Sheila Stainer has lived in Thundersley Park Road for 30 years and said she will struggle to get to the sorting office because of a spinal disability.

She said: 'The roads are not made up because we're on greenbelt, but I've never known one person to fall off their bike or slip on the road.

'They've done it without consultation from everyone or anyone.'

Mel South, 60, of Wensley Road has already submitted an initial stage one appeal against the ban.

In his appeal letter, he wrote: 'I am a trained manager in both health and safety and the preparation of risk assessments so I am aware that you must have an accident record log which I request site of.

'Should you not be able to re-instate deliveries this will be essential at future stages, especially if the residents enlist professional help.'

Royal Mail has three months to respond to the initial appeal, before it can move to stage two and three appeals.

Residents in Bower Road and Rhoda Road have also been affected.

Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said the decision to suspend deliveries is a temporary measure.

She said: 'We have reluctantly decided to temporarily suspend deliveries to a number of addresses in a particular part of Benfleet.

'This is because the private, unpaved roads in the area are in a poor state of repair.

'That poor state of repair has meant some of our vehicles have been damaged and there have been some near accidents for our postmen and women.

'It is the responsibility of the residents to ensure that private roads are fit for purpose and do not constitute a safety risk. This is far from being a trivial matter and we will not compromise on the safety of our colleagues or the roadworthiness of our vehicles.'
