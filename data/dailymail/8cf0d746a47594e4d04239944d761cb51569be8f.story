The South African man who shot Anni Dewani dead on her honeymoon in Cape Town has died in prison from brain cancer.

Xolile Mngeni was  handed a life sentence in 2012 after being found guilty of hijacking a cab that Anni and her husband Shrien were riding in, before shooting her in the neck.

In July this year it was reported that he was due to be freed from prison on compassionate grounds after 11 doctors signed a waiver saying he didn't have long to live, but the attempt failed.

Xolile Mngeni, the man who shot Anni Dewani dead in Cape Town while she was on her honeymoon with husband Shrien Dewani, has died of brain cancer

Shrien Dewani is currently on trial in South Africa after Mngeni's accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, told the court Dewani ordered his wife's death. Mngeni had been due to appear, but was deemed to be too ill

Mngeni was first diagnosed with aggressive tumour in 2011. He was jailed for the killing in 2012, and was back in hospital earlier this year. He had been attempting to get released from prison on compassionate grounds

In September it is believed Mngeni met with his lawyers to discuss a second bid, claiming he could be cared for at home by one of his relatives who is a health care worker, but the case was never brought back before a judge.

Mngeni had been suffering from pineoblastoma since 2011, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer which has a very low survival rate.

After he was convicted of Anni's killing, her father branded the drug dealer 'a weak and spineless coward' for killing his 'defenceless' daughter.

He was jailed along with accomplice Mziwamadoda Qwabe, who admitted his part in the crime, but told the court the killing had been ordered by Shrien Dewani, who paid £1,400.

Qwabe has been appearing for the prosecution at Shrien Dewani's trial, saying that he  hijakced the Dewanis' car as it drove through the notorious Gugulethu township, before throwing Shrien out.

He told the court that he had been driving as Mngeni turned around and shot Anni in the neck, severing her spine and killing her. 

He alleged that Dewani had ordered the killing to be done in this way to make it look like an ordinary street crime. 

It was believed Mngeni had been due to appear at the trial, but was too ill to take to the stand.

Anni Dewani's family arrive at her husband's trail in South Africa this week. It was their outcry at the possibility of Mngeni being released that, in part, led to the appeal being turned down

During his previous court appearances, Mngeni had appeared frail, and on several occasions had to use a frame to walk to the dock.

Mngeni was diagnosed with cancer before his initial trial in 2012, but after several rounds of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, he was deemed fit to stand.

He was convicted and handed a life sentence, but was rushed to hospital again at the beginning of this year in critical condition after the cancer returned.

His condition was stabilised, but judges were asked to consider releasing him from jail after 11 doctors assessed him and concluded that time was running out.

Shrien and Anni were riding in this cab when it was hijacked by Mngeni and Qwabe. Anni's body was found slumped in the back seat the following day

On November 13, 2010, Anni Dewani was killed by a single gunshot wound to the neck while on honeymoon with her husband, millionaire Shrien Dewani.

Shrien maintains his wife was killed as part of an everyday hijacking. However, he is now on trial accused of ordering her murder after others involved in the crime pointed the finger at him:

Gunman Xolile Mngeni 

Mngeni was first arrested on November 16, three days after Anni was killed, at his home and charged with robbery and kidnapping.

He denied the charges and was held in custody. On December 7 his accomplice, Zola Tongo, was jailed after pleading guilty. As part of his plea bargain, Tongo named Mngeni as one of the kidnappers.

The following year Mngeni was first diagnosed with pineoblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. After chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery he was deemed fit to stand trial.

On August 8, 2012, Mngeni's associate Mziwamadoda Qwabe also pleaded guilty to his part in the crime. 

At the time he told a court he and Mngeni kidnapped the couple, but said it was Mngeni who shot Anni.

In November Mngeni was found guilty of premeditated murder at the Western Cape High Court. The following month he was sentenced to life in prison for the killing.

In early 2014 he was rushed to hospital in critical condition after the brain tumour came back. Eleven doctors assessed his condition and ruled he should be released as he did not have long to live. 

However, after an outcry from Anni's family, a judge turned the request down and Mngeni was returned to jail.

Earlier this month Shrien went on trial accused of ordering his wife's killing. Mngeni was thought to be a future witness for the prosecution, but earlier today he died behind bars. 

Taxi driver Zola Tongo 

Tongo, who had been driving Shrien and Anni Dewani through Cape Town when their car was hijacked, was arrested four days after Mngeni, and held in custody by police in South Africa.

Just over two weeks later he agreed to plead guilty in return for a reduced sentence of 18 years behind bars.

As part of his plea bargain, he told judges that Shrien Dewani paid him £1,400 to arrange his wife's killing, a statement strongly denied by the millionaire businessman's family. 

In his statement, Tongo said he recruited Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe to hijack the cab he was driving before executing Anni.

He says he was ordered to make the killing appear like a random street crime.

Kidnapper Mziwamadoda Qwabe

Qwabe was arrested shortly after Mngeni and charged with similar offences.

On August 8, 2012, after being named by Tongo as part of his plea bargain, Qwabe also pleaded guilty to Anni's kidnapping and murder and was given 25 years in jail.    

At the time, he told the court that he was recruited for the job by Tongo, and went on to confirm Tongo's statement. 

He also said that Dewani told the group that the killing must look like a street crime.

He claimed that, while he hijakced the cab Anni and Shrien Dewani were travelling in, he did not kill the bride. Instead, he testified that Mngeni pulled the trigger.

New husband Shrien Dewani

On the day Anni was killed, Shrien had been riding in the cab with her through Gugulethu township when Mngeni and Qwabe stopped the vehicle and hijakced it.

Shrien was thrown out of the car, and the two men made off with Anni. Her body was found the following day, with a single gunshot wound to the neck.

Dewani returned to the UK shortly after the killing where he had treatment for stress. After Anni's body was flown back, he attended her funeral on November 21.

Only a few days later, he was forced to issue the first denial that he was responsible for his wife's death after allegations were made against him.

On December 7, Tongo claimed in open court that Dewani ordered the killing of his wife, and the same day Dewani was arrested in Bristol under a South African warrant.

At the beginning of 2011, Dewani was moved to the Priory Hospital in Bristol where he was reported to be suffering severe post-traumatic stress disorder. He was later detained under the Mental Health Act in his home city.

Meanwhile, at his extradition hearing, the prosecution cited an unnamed witness who testified that Dewani said he needed to 'find a way out of' his marriage months before his wedding.

On August 10, District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Dewani could be extradited to South Africa to stand trial. 

However the following year, as Mngeni and Qwabe were jailed, the High Court halted Dewani's extradition on health grounds, but judges said he should still be sent abroad 'as soon as he is fit'.

During his trial, Shrien Dewani has admitted to having accounts on gay dating sites such as Recon (pictured), but said he was bisexual and loved his wife

Throughout 2013, Dewani was moved in and out of mental hospitals while continuing to fight his extradition. After repeated appeals, three judges at the Supreme Court - the highest in the land - rejected Dewani's last attempt to stay extradition early this year.

Dewani arrived in South Africa on April 8, and after a medical team ruled that his condition had improved, his defence council said he would be fit to take the stand.

On October 6, two weeks ago, Dewani attended the first day of his trial, accused of ordering his wife's killing.

So far, the court has heard that Dewani surfed gay dating websites, where he described himself as a 'submissive', and asked an older man's advice about coming out as gay.

Dewani, however, denies these claims and says he is bisexual. He also told police that Anni wanted to visit the dangerous township where she was killed. Police also said he was found sobbing on the night she died.

The trial continues.
