A couple had to be pulled out of mudflats by a crew in an RAF helicopter after they got stuck while walking their dog.

Charlotte Lomas and boyfriend Luke had not realised they had strayed onto the mudflats in East Mersea in Essex until they found themselves waist-deep in mud and unable to move. 

They had tried to pull each other out of the mud before they got stuck and were forced to call 999 for help as it began to get dark.

A couple and their dog had to be winched to safety from mudflats in Essex after they strayed onto mudflats while walking the animal and then found themselves stuck waist-deep in the mud at the country park 

Eight rescue teams - including a crew in an RAF helicopter - were called to rescue the struggling couple. 

The pair were walking Charlotte's greyhound, Chip, at Cudmore Grove Country Park, East Mersea, when they found themselves in a grassy area and began to get stuck in the mud. 

Miss Lomas, from Bicknacre, Essex, tried to help her boyfriend, but ended up getting stuck herself.

She said: 'We had never taken Chip to Mersea before.

'We walked from the car park along the coastline and it led to an area we thought was just grass. We didn't realise it was the mud flats.

'Luke went across first but got stuck. Within a couple of minutes the mud was up to his thigh.

'I was trying to pull him out but then I got stuck from where I was trying to pull him.

'We were trying for about 45 minutes before we called 999. We were shouting for help. No one could see us and it started to get dark.'

Essex Police sent a rescue team and helicopter to the scene along with seven other teams who were called at about 3.45pm on Saturday to help save the terrified pair.

Chip, eight, was not stuck, but was found lying down waiting close to the couple - who were wedged in the mud by the time crews arrived.

PC Shaun Hammond was first on the scene because he knew the area well and suspected where the trio would be.

Several rescue crews were sent to help the couple, including a team in an RAF helicopter to pull them out 

Miss Lomas was rescued first and was strapped to a RAF crew member so she could be freed from the mud. The crews comforted Miss Lomas' 24-year-old boyfriend who had mud almost up to his waist at the time

Miss Lomas' boyfriend, clutching Chip, was then strapped to the rescuer and both were hauled from the mud  

The Mersea coastguard team, fire fighters, ambulance crews and the RAF Sea King helicopter also arrived on scene.

The RAF helicopter winched the pair to safety but they did not need to go to hospital.

In total, the emergency response teams and vehicles called to the scene were; an ambulance, an ambulance officer, a rapid response car and a hazardous area response team, one fire engine from Mersea, and the fire service's urban search and rescue boat, police officers in patrol cars and a helicopter, the RAF Sea King helicopter and coastguards.

Charlotte, a theatre assistant at Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital, praised PC Hammond because without his knowledge it would have taken far longer to find them.

She said: 'We cannot thank everyone enough.

'We have managed to get the addresses of everyone who helped and we are going to send letters to say thank you so much and for the speed at which they found us.'
