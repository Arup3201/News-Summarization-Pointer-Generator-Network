Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election, a stunning turnaround after a tight race that had put his lengthy rule in jeopardy.

With nearly all the votes counted, Likud appeared to have earned 30 out of parliament's 120 seats and was in a position to be able to build a coalition government with its right-wing and religious allies with relative ease.

The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years.

Recent opinion polls indicated he was in trouble, giving chief rival Isaac Herzog of the opposition Zionist Union a slight lead. Exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, Likud soared forward. Zionist Union wound up with just 24 seats.

Even before the final results were known, Netanyahu declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly.

'Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud,' Netanyahu told supporters at election night headquarters. 'I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important.'

He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!'

Hopeful: Zionist Union supporters chant for victory. In the end their party won just 24 seats

Support: Norris in his YouTube video

Netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who said that his re-election was crucial for the safety of Israel.

In a short YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people.

'I have done three movies in Israel – 'Delta Force' being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way.

'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. You see, we the American people need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too.

'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day.

'And as far as those in the U.S. and the rest of the world, in this season of Easter, it's good to remember what the Hebrew Scriptures say about Israel and those who support her: 'Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May they prosper who love you' (Psalm 122:1).'

Herzog said on Wednesday he had spoken with  Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory.

'A few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck,' Herzog told reporters.

He said his leftist Zionist Union party would continue to be an alternative to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud. 

Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people.

Netanyahu's return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States.

Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community.

In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a key policy goal of the White House and the international community. He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.

Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran. The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not coordinated with the White House ahead of time.

In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor.

Netanyahu will still need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose upstart Kulanu party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues. He is expected to become the country's next finance minister.
