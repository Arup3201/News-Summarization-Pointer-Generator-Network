Steven Johnson, 53, of Colleyville, Texas, was showing his handgun to friends when it discharged and a bullet struck his 10-year-old daughter

A 10-year-old girl is recovering after her father accidentally shot her in the hand while showing his gun to friends in the family home.

Steven Johnson, 53, of Colleyville, Texas, discharged the handgun just before midnight on Saturday, The Dallas Morning News reported.

A bullet went through the wall and struck Johnson's daughter who was in another room, Colleyville city spokeswoman Mona Gandy said. 

The girl, who has not been named, was taken to Baylor Emergency Medical Center at Colleyville by her mother. 

She was later flown to Children's Medical Center of Dallas to be treated. 

The child has since been released from the hospital, NBC DFW reported.

Police were called to the home after the incident and Johnson was arrested.

Johnson was taken to the Keller Police Department Jail and faces charges of injury to a child.

'From the circumstances officers observed at the house, they felt like they had cause to make an arrest for injury to a child,' Gandy told The Dallas Morning News. 

Gandy could not say if there were other children at the couple's home in the Fort Worth, Texas suburb.

The shooting comes just days after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) has not conducted gun-control research since 1996 despite President Barack Obama ordering the organization to resume studies two years ago.

Earlier in January, an off-duty Kentucky policeman accidentally shot himself after fumbling with his gun while in an elevator with his wife.

On New Year's Day, a Californian man accidentally shot dead his girlfriend as he fired celebratory shots at their apartment complex. 

The girl was flown to Children's Medical Center of Dallas to be treated for a hand injury. Johnson was arrested, facing charges of injury to a child
