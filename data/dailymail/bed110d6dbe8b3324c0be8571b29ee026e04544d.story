Danny Simpson will be back at Old Trafford on Saturday but admits the place bears no resemblance to the Manchester United he once knew.

The Leicester City full back is one of a number of former United players in Nigel Pearson’s squad as they attempt to do an unlikely double against the Reds.

Danny Drinkwater and Matt James came through the academy ranks at Carrington and Ritchie de Laet was signed as a promising 20-year-old defender from Stoke City before all were shown the door by Sir Alex Ferguson.

While the latter is still serving a three-match ban after seeing red against Aston Villa on January 10, De Laet and Drinkwater should join Simpson in the Foxes’ starting XI.

They’ll know all about the surroundings, but Simpson insists the familiarities end there given the upheaval at the club since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.

‘There’s a few of us here but there is also a quite a lot in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘It’s special for us to go back and try and put in a performance.

‘It’s a bit different as we don’t know Louis van Gaal as it was Sir Alex so it’s good for us to go back.

‘It’s a new manager, new ideas and new players so it will take time. He is a top class manager with top class players so I’m sure they are more than satisfied.

‘I’ve had some good results going back to Old Trafford. Hopefully we can put in a good performance and we can show desire. If we can show that again like we did in our last game against them then you never know. ‘

That was the 5-3 demolition at the King Power Stadium back in September, after which they wobbled severely – a 13-match winless run.

But the last-gasp FA Cup win at Tottenham, coupled with an upturn in the Premier League, sees Pearson’s side travel to United in a positive manner.

They are likely to come up against a youthful side, and Simpson moved to credit Van Gaal for blooding youngsters such as Tyler Blackett and James Wilson – even though his own experience was rather more difficult, leaving five years ago after earning just one Premier League stat.

‘It’s a tough first-team to break into but a lot of the young lads are getting a few minutes,’ he added. ‘I’m sure they will make the most of it and kick on and try and cement themselves as a full time first-team player. It’s a great club so good look to them.’
