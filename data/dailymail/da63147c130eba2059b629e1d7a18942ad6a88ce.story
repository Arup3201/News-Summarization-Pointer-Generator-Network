After a 100 year long wait you would think a time capsule would contain something a bit more exciting than a bunch of letters, some flags and council receipts.

A mysterious parcel kept in a small Norwegian town since 1912 was opened tonight, but unfortunately there were none of the oil shares they may have hoped for.

The package had the instructions ‘May be opened in 2012’ and despite the 90-minute build-up at tonight's ceremony in Otta, central Norway, the contents failed to shake the world.

The big opening: After a century-long wait the package was revealed to contain ceremonial flags, memorial documents from the anniversary of the Battle of Kringen and private correspondence as well as records of Norwegian emigrants

Unwrapping: Kjell Voldheim was one of two local museum archivers who opened the 100 year old package in tonight's ceremony

The parcel was left in the council's 
care in 1928 by Johan Nygaard, a former chairman of Sel council in Otta,
 who had wrapped and sealed it in 1912 on the 300th anniversary of the 
legendary Battle of Kringen.

The battle stood in Otta in 1612 
between local peasants and Scottish mercenary soldiers on their way 
through the Norwegian woods to enlist to fight in the Swedish army 
during Kalmar War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden.

Miraculously the Norwegian peasants 
won and it is believed that the contents of the package may have some 
connection to the battle 400 years ago.

Although it has spent the last few 
years safely stored on display at the local museum, it has been 
forgotten a few times over the years and was nearly lost for good in the
 fifties during a renovation at the local council and had to be rescued 
from the tip.

Caretakers: Mr Voldheim and Ms Dahl wore gloves when handling the parcel and its contents

The crowd held its breath as the parcel was placed on the table to be opened

The ceremony earlier tonight saw a 90 
minute build-up to the opening where international guests and local 
dignitaries were treated to traditional music and dance before the 
package came on stage.

The package was brought to a podium by
 museum workers Torveig Dahl and Kjell Voldheim who opened it with the 
help of the chairman of the council.

Mr Voldheim, a registrar at the local museum, said yesterday that they had many ideas of what it may contain.

'We have thought a lot about what it might be.'' he told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang.

‘It could be historical documents, or
 maybe the Blue Star Diamond from the Titanic which sank in 1912. 
Although the council is probably hoping it is a bunch of oil shares.’

With gloved hands Ms Dahl and Mr Voldheim carefully opened up the package to reveal… another package.

‘This has something new written on it,
 Mr Voldheim said as he held up the smaller parcel. ‘”Ha ha,” he joked 
with the crowd before offering the package to Ms Dahl to help him open.

Necks were craned to get a view of the
 contents which turned out to be memorial flags, including a royal 
banner, and documents from early 20th century.

Due to the limited time frame Mr Voldheim announced that the contents would be thoroughly investigated backstage

As well as private handwritten 
correspondence which appeared to be between Mr Nygaard and others in the
 area including the local priest, it contained photographs and
 documents connected to the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Kringen.

Mr Voldheim said: 'For museum archivers - this is a gold mine.

'We don’t know what we should do with all his. Where are the oil shares?'

It also included two newspapers from 1914 - two years after it was meant to have been sealed, something which baffled the historians.

The unexplained newspapers were found underneath envelope after envelope of receipts, accountancy and files from the council in Otta including records of people who emigrated to the United States.

The date on the package is the 26th of August 1912, which was the 300th anniversary of a famous battle between local peasants and Scottish mercenary soldiers hired by the Swedish army

Do not open: Locals in Otta has kept the parcel safe for a century and tonight's ceremony was eagerly anticipated

Due to the limited time frame Mr Voldheim could not display all of the contents of the package on stage.

The pair announced that they will return later tonight to give a full lists of the contents of the package and additional finds.

Otta is located 180 miles north of Oslo in central Norway
