Britain's answer to David Blaine has won £10,000 by predicting exactly how Spain would win Euro 2012 from the quarter finals onwards.

Appearing on This Morning yesterday, Dynamo showed presenters Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield how he guessed the winner of every match correctly.

Holding up a betting slip as proof of the 10,000-1 gambit the illusionist had even forecast how Spain would win by two or more goals against their Italian rivals.

Today, Paddy Power confirmed the bet was placed but the winnings had not been collected.

Prediction: Dynamo put an £1 accumulator bet on the Euro 2012 Football Championships at the quarter-final stage - correctly guessing each team's victory

The magician, whose previous stunts include walking across the River Thames, told how he did a £1 accumulator bet just before the quarter-finals on June 21.

He then left the Paddy Power slip with the production team at ITV, returning two weeks later to appear on the popular TV show.

A Paddy Power spokesman told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that the magician 'Dynamo' placed a winning £1 accumulator bet on Euro 2012 in a Paddy Power betting office in London on Thursday, 21 June last.'

Schofield, 50, said: 'It's extraordinary, you can't fake something like that. It's just incredible.'

Amazing: In June last year, Dynamo, a Bradford-born 
29-year-old, walked across the River Thames making it half way across the
river in front of the Houses of Parliament in London

Dynamo, whose real name is Steven Frayne, will donate his winnings to The Teenage Cancer Trust.

In June last year, the Bradford-born 
29-year-old walked across the River Thames making it half way across the
river in front of the Houses of Parliament in London before he was picked up by what appeared to be a River Police boat.

Stunned onlookers watched from Westminster Bridge as the magician recorded the stunt for his TV show Dynamo: Magician Impossible. A spokesman insisted the photographs were not faked.

On the up: Frayne has so far built his name on the celebrity circuit, astounding a host of famous names with his tricks

Frayne has so far built his name on the celebrity circuit, astounding a host of famous names with his tricks.

Among those who will testify to his skills are the likes of Jay-Z, Coldplay, Will Smith, Busta Rhymes and Paris Hilton.

His previous tricks have included making Little Britain star Matt Lucas levitate before a live audience at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, and turning signed lottery tickets into cash in front of Robbie Williams and Davina McCall as part of BBC's Sport Relief live programme.

Various celebrities have taken part in his TV series including heavyweight boxing champion David Haye, Manchester rocker Ian Brown and pop star Natalie Imbruglia.

In episode one, he performs his trademark levitation trick and physically moves a girl's tan line on the glamorous Miami Beach.

The magician's tricks also include him transporting a mobile phone into a glass beer bottle, turning snow into diamonds in the Austrian mountains and bringing a flutter of butterflies to life in Hollywood's famous Chateau Marmont.

Frayne's current roster of A-list celebrity admirers is a long way from his upbringing on the deprived Delph Hill Estate in Bradford, where he learned magic from his grandfather. That background provided the title for a Channel 4 programme entitled 'Dynamo's Estate Of Mind'.
