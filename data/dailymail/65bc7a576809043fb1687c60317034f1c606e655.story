What two things do Papa Bouba Diop, Park Ji-Sung and Paulo Wanchope have in common?

One, they have all been relegated from the Premier League.

Two, they have all scored more goals in World Cup tournaments than Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney.

On the stretch: Papa Bouba Diop has scored more World Cup goals than Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo

Time to shine! Ronaldo (left) and Messi are the world's best two players and must deliver on the biggest stage

Messi - 571 minutes, 1 goal (2006 + 2010)

Ronaldo - 754 minutes, two goals (2006 + 2010)

Rooney - 595 minutes, 0 goals (2006 + 2010)

Despite seeming to smash a goalscoring 
record every other week in La Liga or the Champions League, both Ronaldo
 and Messi have failed to sparkle in the last two World Cups, while 
Rooney has fallen foul of his own ill indiscipline and poor fitness.

The trio have played 1,920 minutes (32 hours) of World Cup football between them but have collectively found the net just three times during that time.

Diop, in comparison, played in just one World Cup - but what a World Cup it was. A colossus in midfield for Senegal on their debut on the world stage in 2002, he was responsible for one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history when he scored the only goal in a 1-0 win over the then-holders France in the opening game.

Two goals in their third group game, a thrilling 3-3 draw with Uruguay, took his tally for the tournament to three but his hopes of adding to that were thwarted by Senegal failing to qualify for 2006 and 2010.

Will this time be different? Wayne Rooney hasn't performed for England at a major tournament since 2004

Have that! Ex-Derby County striker Paulo Wanchope scored for Costa Rica against Brazil in 2002

Sneaking in: South Korea's Park Ji-Sung nets beyond Portugal's Vitor Baia during the home 2002 finals

Then there’s Park Ji-Sung. A former team-mate of Rooney’s at Old Trafford, the South Korean was one of the poster boys of the 2002 World Cup in the Far East and he did not disappoint. He scored once during Guus Hiddink’s sides run to the semi-final, where they were eventually beaten by Germany. He added further strikes at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.

England’s Group D oppponents Costa Rica would love to still have Wanchope in their side. The Derby County legend was a mainstay for the national side between 1996 and 2008, appearing at two World Cups during that time. He scored against the big names too, in a 5-2 defeat against the eventual champions in 2002, Brazil, and then twice against Germany in the group stages four years later.

Messi, Ronaldo and Rooney have laboured their way through the last two tournaments but with all three firing on all cylinders in qualifying, scoring 10, eight and seven respectively, perhaps that disappointing form in World Cups is about to change.

Other surprise names that have outfired Messi, Ronaldo and Rooney on the biggest stage:

Jon Dahl Tomasson - Denmark (5)

Asamoah Gyan – Ghana (4)

Pauleta – Portugal (4)

Brian McBride – United States (3)

Agustin Delgado - Ecuador (3)

Tim Cahill – Australia (3)

Robbie Keane – Republic of Ireland (3)
