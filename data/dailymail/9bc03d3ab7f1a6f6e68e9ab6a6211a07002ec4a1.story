They were standing 10-deep at the end of Spring Grove, squinting through the afternoon sun as they waited for the riders.

A French-language commentary, was jabbering from a nearby loudspeaker, and a big man in the front row was laboriously translating. The commentator grew more excited and the interpreter turned to his audience: ‘He says Mark Cavendish is giving it a real right go,’ he announced. ‘Come on Cav!’ they yelled, as the leaders flashed by.

They were still yelling when the big man caught another announcement. His face changed, and he quietened the cheering with his message. ‘He’s crashed,’ he said. ‘He’s only bloody crashed! Just down the road.’ There was a groan which ran down the cul–de–sac, through Harrogate and across the breadth of Britain. On the day the Tour came to Yorkshire, we had provided our own luckless victim.

Yet even the sight of an hugely accomplished home contender being swept off to hospital could not obscure the essential triumph of the day.

Contrary to blokeish opinion, the British appreciate other sports beside football. Consider the Springtime miracle of the London Marathon, or the ravenous appetite for Test cricket or international rugby. Recall how the glories of the incomparable 2012 Olympics held the nation in thrall. As a nation, we love an event, and we turn out in dramatic numbers when that event is both significant and accessible. Few things in sport are as significant or as important as the Tour de France.

Yet there was a moment, somewhere between Middleham and East Witton, when it seemed that the Tour was no longer a sport, more the fantasy of a romantic director.

The rain had yielded to brightness, and the moors and dales sprawled languidly to the horizon. Every cliché was obeyed, from the picture-postcard villages of mellow stone to the sturdy Norman churches, the barns bulging with hay and the fluffy clouds wafting across broad blue swathes of sky. The whole affair seemed like an adoring advertisement for the glories of Yorkshire. Which, to a great extent, it was.

The Yorkshire Post spoke of the world’s greatest cycle race coming to the world’s greatest county. Yorkshiremen will not consider that a boast, more a statement of fact.

Then there was the small matter of brass, which does not go overlooked here. The figure of  £100 million benefit to the local economy may have been plucked from the air by an ambitious publicist, but it is thought to be close to the truth. Certainly, the investment has proved hugely successful. All the conventions were observed. At daybreak in Leeds, later in Harrogate, and in possibly in every town and village en route, a breakfast television hack could be found pleading with crowds for a spot of raucous enthusiasm: ‘Are we excited about the Tour de France coming to Yorkshire?’ ‘Yeahhhhhh!’ It is the squirming tradition they observe for royal weddings and It’s A Knockout.

But the response was everything the sport could have wished. Quite aside from the tumult of town and city, the way in which the crowds closed in on the climbers — urging, cajoling, doing everything short of hauling them to the peak — was every bit as fervent as their cousins in the Pyrenees. These were not curious observers, these were people who understood what they saw.

Just yesterday, Sir Dave Brailsford, the Godfather of the sport in this country, announced his belief that Britain is the world’s premier cycling nation. Certainly, the public appears to ‘get it’, an underestimated affection which has its roots in the achievements of such as Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins, and which will increase when the next generation of cyclists states its case.  But you can discern authentic knowledge, as contenders such as Alberto Contador of Spain, Vincenzo Nibali of Italy and the American Andrew Talansky are earnestly discussed.

And cycling’s appeal was easily understood. It felt like a unique occasion; a day which challenged the imagination. Sport offers few finer sights than that of the peloton unfolding like some exotic insect, writhing its way through Kidstones and Kettlewell, Masham and Muker and a whole litany of place names which have rarely been spoken with Gallic intonation.

In truth, the collision of cultures was intriguing: Geoffrey Boycott meets Eric Cantona. Organisers were staggered by the numbers which turned out. It is estimated that two million will come out to cheer this Yorkshire weekend. Most seem to be wearing yellow jerseys, indeed, only Rio has more. And their optimism is heartening,

But this is Yorkshire, and the locals are not easily carried away. At breakfast in a Leeds hotel yesterday, an elderly man noticed me studying the Tour handbook. ‘You going to the bike race?’ he asked. I said I was. ‘Where’s it going?’ he inquired. I told him of the winding route through moor and dale and the circular tour of North Yorkshire. He grunted. There’s quicker ways of getting to Harrogate’, he said.

Yorkshire may have embraced the Tour, but there is still work to be done.
