These stunning photographs look like the ultimate holiday snaps of idyllic tropical destinations.

But in fact, the images were not even taken outside - they were crafted in a studio using props including nuts, chocolate and jelly bean.

Artist Matthew Albanese spent up to 700 hours on each fake landscape, making them into lifelike depictions of scenes such as a desert island, a lightning storm and a brook at sunset.

Tropical: But this photograph does not show a real landscape, and was made from turkey feathers and cooking sugar

Coral reef: This work, 'How to Breathe Underwater', uses clever lighting to appear as if it were made under the sea

Scary: 'Box of Lightning' has a black plexiglass background and is backlit to create the lightning effect

One piece even appears to show an underwater coral reef - but the marine ambience was created with lighting and innovative materials.

To make the piece he used walnuts, candle wax, wire, glitter, peanut shells, dead starfish, compressed moss, jellybeans, coated seashells, toothpaste, clay, figs, feathers, cotton earbuds and chocolates.

The surface of the ocean is actually a vinyl shower curtain over suspended plexiglass, while the piece's underwater glow comes from fake fog and a video projector.

The 30-year-old from Englewood, New Jersey has been making his deceptive artworks for the past three years.

Naturalistic: 'New Life 1' was made from ostrich feathers, a painted paper background and even chocolate for the mud

Turbulent: 'New Life 2' depicts the same scene but in stormy weather, showing the artist's versatility

Countryside: 'Willow Study 1' sewing thread, sticks, wood and feathers, with fake moss and dip-dyed cotton for the grass

Mystery: Even at close up, it can be hard to work out what Mr Albanese's works are really made of

'I'm trying to change people's perspectives of small objects by creating something big with them,' Mr Albanese said.

For the storm depicted in 'Box of Lightning', the artist etched lightning bolts into a backlit slab of black plexiglass, allowing the light to pass through.

'I became very interested in creating an illusion of light - so I created light boxes and modifiers,' he said.

'I set the scene to depict how it would look in nature - the lighting bolts serve as the only source of light in the entire image.'

Hard at work: Mr Albanese finesses cotton clouds which fill the sky in his work 'Paradise'

Craftsman: The base for 'Paradise' was made out of caramelised sugar which resembles the ocean

Elaborate: Each miniature piece takes up to 700 hours to create - all for the sake of a single photograph

Technical: The artist has been producing his unique creations for the past three years

Mr Albanese has been fascinated by miniature movie sets since childhood, and when he was a student at the State University of New York at Purchase he made table-top dioramas.

For 'New Life 1' and 'New Life 2', he created a willow tree from hand-dyed ostrich feathers, painted parchment paper water, chocolate mud, wire, cotton, coffee, synthetic potting moss and raffia ribbon.

'A mistake with something when making one set can actually lead to new discoveries and new ideas on how to use the materials I find,' he said. 'So mistakes can actually create entirely new sets.

'I'm always looking at materials and seeing what I could do differently with them.'

Innovation: Mr Albanese etched lightning bolts into a sheet of black plexiglass to light up one of his works

Set: Mr Albanese, 30, works out of his studio set up in his living room in Englewood, New Jersey

'Paradise' took four months to complete, and is comprised of spray-painted turkey feathers for the palm trees, and cooked sugar on top of tin foil for the water.

His 'Willow Study 1' was created from sewing thread, sticks, wood and hand dyed ostrich plumes.

The grass in the set was made of faux potting moss and dip dyed cotton.

Mr Albanese has completed about 30 sets in total and is releasing his new book, Strange Worlds, in October.

Careful: Delicate objects such as the willow tree made from ostrich feathers in 'New Life 1' require a deft touch

Different angle: Looking at 'New Life 2' side on clearly shows that it is a product of artificial creation

Misleading: The underwater effects in some works are created by clever use of the camera and lights
