Teaching your pet tricks can be a time-consuming chore and is often done in vain.

However when the owner of a horse spotted some musical talent in his steed, he knew he was onto a winner.

The Swedish owner filmed his skilled stallion 'playing' the recorder, managing to get through most of 'Twinkle, twinkle little star' - with a little help of course.

The less-than-authentic appearing 
clip from 2009 has now made its way onto YouTube and sees the owner, 
named in the video as Curre, show off his horse Axiom's musical prowess.

As a result, the talented Axiom, who 
lives in a stable north of Stockholm, has become the next animal star of
the internet, amassing over 65,000 views in less than a week.

His new fans back him up with praise 
and disbelief as to whether it is indeed Axiom playing the recorder, 
whilst one simply quipped: 'He's no Miles Davies.'
