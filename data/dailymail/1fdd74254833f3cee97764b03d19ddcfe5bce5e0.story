Caroline Pugh, 33, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, has revealed how she was shocked into losing seven stone after her six-year-old daughter Daisy drew a picture of her looking like a 'fat blob.' 

Mrs Pugh, who now has three children, Daisy, six, Tizzy, four, and Teddy, two, with husband Andy, 37, a warehouse manager, said she was embarrassed by what her daughter saw when she looked at her 19-stone mother.

She said: ‘It was so embarrassing when I saw the picture that Daisy had drawn. I didn’t realise that my children saw me as looking so huge.'

Despite having broken a chair just by sitting on it while pregnant, Caroline says it was the embarrassment of seeing a drawing by daughter Daisy (left drawing in picture), which really gave her the motivation she needed to lose weight

Caroline continued: ‘I got so tired running around after them all the time, my weight meant that I couldn’t keep up with them properly at all, which did upset me.

'When I saw that picture I knew that I really had to do something about losing weight.'

Though it wasn't the first sign that her weight was getting out of hand, Caroline admits it was the trigger she needed.

She said: ‘I’d tried to push it to the back of my mind. With three young children to look after, my own appearance wasn’t a priority, but my health was suffering too.

'When I was 12 weeks pregnant with Teddy I actually broke a kitchen chair. I’d sat down on it, and it completely gave way beneath my weight.'

The mother of three, pictured here with son Teddy, two, and daughters Daisy (left), six, and Tizzy (right), four,  says that she now feels like a completely different person after dropping five dress sizes

Before her weight loss Caroline used to skip breakfast, and snack on bread and crisps all day. Instead of home-cooked dinners, she says she'd eat takeaways several times a week with husband Adam

She continued: ‘This drawing really brought it home to me. I didn’t want my children drawing pictures of their fat mummy anymore.' 

Before she changed her diet, Caroline ate crisps and up to three sandwiches or sausage rolls for lunch, before gorging on pizza and takeaways for dinner.

She said: 'My diet was awful before. 

'I’d completely skip breakfast then have lots of bread and crisps or sausage rolls for lunch'

She continued: 'We would have takeaways several times a week too and I just snacked on crisps all the time.

‘When I started on the diet I still had takeaways but in moderation and I would snack on low fat crisps, fruit and yoghurt instead.’

After seeking help from her local Weight Watchers group, Caroline says she started to lose the pounds quickly.

Swapping her old diet for low fat cereal with skimmed milk at breakfast, and homemade, healthier lunches, Caroline has now dropped five dress sizes and weighs a much lighter 12 stone.

She said: ‘Everything has totally changed since I’ve lost all this weight, I feel like a completely different person.

'I feel so much healthier and I’ve got much more energy to run around and look after the children now. 

'Andy says its like having a new wife. He’s very proud of me'

She continued: ‘My children draw pictures of me now looking lovely and slim. 

'I’m no longer a fat mummy, instead I’m a yummy mummy.’ 

Despite all the praise from her husband however, along with being able to fit into slinkier, more fashionable clothes, Caroline says it was the first drawing from Daisy of her as a slimmer woman, which really gave her the reward she was looking for.

She said: 'When I saw that new picture that Daisy had drawn, I felt very proud of what I had achieved. 

'I can’t believe that I managed to lose so much weight.'

'It was only a child’s drawing but it meant the world to me.'
