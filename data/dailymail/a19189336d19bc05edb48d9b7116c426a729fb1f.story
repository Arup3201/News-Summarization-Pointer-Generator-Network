Even the most determined entrepreneur could falter in the face of outright ridicule from the hard-to-please investors on Dragons’ Den. Not Guy Jeremiah.

Two years after Theo Paphitis told him he’d rather stick pins in his eyes than back his idea for a collapsible water bottle, his invention is available in 16 countries – and he has sold 100,000 of them.

And if that was not enough to convince the Dragons they had missed a trick, he has also signed a distribution deal with Marks & Spencer.

Dismissive: Dragon Theo Paphitis was not impressed with Guy Jeremiah's collapsible plastic water bottle invention when the inventor appeared on the show two years ago

The chain is selling the bottle, called Aquatina, near checkouts and in its takeaway food sections.Manufactured in Sheffield, the  ‘collapsabottle’ is sold as a cheap and environmentally friendly alternative to buying bottled water.

Mr Jeremiah originally presented his idea to the BBC’s five dragons – Mr Paphitis, Duncan Bannatyne, Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and James Caan – in 2010.

All five dismissed the idea, and even by the standards of the notoriously tough show, they gave Mr Jeremiah a grilling.

An angry Mr Jones said the Aquatina would not take any sales from the bottled water market. ‘This is not something that is going to sell in anything like the volume you think,’ he said.

Mr Bannatyne, who runs gyms, described the bottles as cumbersome – and got so angry that he threw one across the room. He said: ‘This is a terrible invention. I just cannot see the point of this. It’s ludicrous.’

Mr Paphitis was particularly dismissive and delivered the final blow, saying: ‘This is one of those “I’d really want to stick pins in my eyes” moments. You’ve got five sophisticated investors here who don’t want to be treated like idiots. I’m out.’

The buyers at M&S, however, took a different view.

Lesley Saunders, its ‘Food on the Move’ expert, said: ‘This is perfect for the summer months when you’re on the go and need a bottle of water to hand without the hassle of having to carry something heavy around.

We are going to be stocking it near our till points and as part of our “Food on the Move” range so it can be easily picked up by our customers who we know like to buy food and drink they can enjoy when on the go.’

The Aquatina is also on sale in 15 other countries, including Germany, Australia, Canada, Spain, Japan, Italy and Sweden. The plastic bottles have a concertina design so that, when compressed, they are only a third of their original size, small enough to be carried in a handbag or pocket.

Mr Jeremiah said: ‘100,000 British pocket-bottles later, it seems the public and the Dragons reached very different verdicts.

‘It’s a real vote of confidence that M&S spotted the environmental and commercial benefits of collapsabottles. To have Aquatina collapsible bottles available nationwide, and internationally, means we’re now in that luxurious position of being able to cast the Dragons aside, and not vice versa.

‘It’s pretty clear that the Dragons were the only people who didn’t understand the value of our product. It’s handy, convenient and sustainable and makes a great alternative to buying bottled water.’

The brightly coloured bottles, which expand to hold 500ml of water, cost £4.99.

It is not the first time that an invention rejected on Dragons’ Den has been picked up with great success by M&S.

James Nash’s idea for a ‘cup-a-wine’ was dismissed by the show’s investors, but M&S later made him an offer, and in 2010 began selling a single-serve plastic cup of its Le Froglet wine.

The cups, which have a tear-off lid, proved hugely popular, particularly  with concert-goers and picnickers, and initially sold out. M&S has since extended the range to include a four pack.
