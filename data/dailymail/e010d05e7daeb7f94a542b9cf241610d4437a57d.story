British buyers seeking their very own French chateaux have seen property prices drop by more than 45 per cent since 2007 - with the further bonus of the collapse in the value of the Euro. 

Bargain hunters can a historic property in the popular Dordogne region for less than €1million - £750,000, with better value on offer in less fashionable areas.

One luxury property, which is available for less than £500,000 in Bordeaux features a 16th century castle on four hectares. 

This four bedroom house in the Dordogne has been reduced from £1.1m to £830,000 

This 17th century chateaux near Dijon has been fully restored and is wroth in the region of £2million 

The property has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms, with a small cottage for the caretaker, an apartment for the gardener and a large wine cellar. 

Property expert Bruno de Saint-Exupery, director of the Emile Garcin estate agency told The Times: 'You can find chateaux with 500 square metres of living room in a good condition in the perigord for €800,000 to €900,000 today. Some prices have fallen 45 per cent since 2007.'

It is estimated that there are 40,000 chateaux across France and due to a reduction in property prices combined with the general weakness of the Euro, British buyers have the opportunity to secure bargains. 

However, experts warned that local and national property taxes could have set back the new home owner anything between £20,000 and £80,000 a year. 

Patrick Besse, who has 136 properties on his books said: 'They are changing hands now because the children have gone abroad or because those who have stayed in France do not have the means to pay for their upkeep.'  

This chateaux near Bordeaux has a 8.5 hectare vineyard and separate cottage cost £2.3 million
