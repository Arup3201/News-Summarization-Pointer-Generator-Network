Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, urges ministers to increase the NHS budget to GP services from nine to 10 per cent

The NHS could face a shortage of 16,000 GPs by 2021 unless the government ring-fences more funds for primary care, a leading doctor has warned.

Currently, there is a shortfall of more than 8,300 GPs across the UK, but that it set to almost double if the rate of spending and budget cuts continues.

Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the NHS is facing a 'catastrophe' unless more funding is directed into he struggling service.

Surgeries are already being stretched, she said, due to patients opting to visit their GP instead of attending accident and emergency departments.

The number of A&E services has been cut in recent years and waits for non-urgent treatment, particularly non-life threatening accidents for example, can be long.

NHS England last week said that unless things change, the NHS will face a black hole of £30 billion by 2021.

Dr Gerada says this will equate to a £2.7billion squeeze on GP doctors - meaning a further shortfall of 7,500 GPs.

Dr Gerada said: 'The fact that, in just eight years, we could see a shortfall of almost 16,000 GPs is truly shocking.

'General practice is at the heart of the NHS and if it is left to wither, as is the case now, it could sow the seeds of an unprecedented disintegration of the NHS, both in primary care and secondary care.

'Such is the key role that general practice plays, that if it starts to fall apart the impact will be felt across the rest of the health service – leading to longer waits in A&E and ever more last minute cancellations of elective surgery.'

She urged ministers to do more to 
protect healthcare budgets, and as such protect patient care,  by 
'immediately' increasing the funding for general practice by 10 per cent, 'as a first step'.

She called for the government to work with GPs to help 'boost' the number of medical graduates going into general practice.

'Only by supporting general practice and 
allowing it to treat more patients in the community, can the Government 
protect the NHS from catastrophe – and ensure that the health service 
can meet the projected health needs of the population.'

'Only by supporting it and allowing it to treat more patients in the community can they government protect the NHS from catastrophe,' she said.

Currently, GP surgeries are allocated nine per cent of NHS cash but they are responsible for 90 per cent of patients' contact with the health service, the RCGP said.

GPs have previously come under criticism for the high salaries they receive and the lack of services offered on the weekends.

Dr Gerada called on the health secretary Jeremy Hunt to work with GPs to help boost the number of graduates choosing a career as a GP, as opposed to hospital positions

However, a recent poll, carried out by the RCGP, found that the community doctors work long days and are overstretched.

The poll found that 55 per cent of 
GPs conduct 40 to 60 patient consultations each day; 46 per cent say 
they work at least 11 hours in surgery each day;  and 84 per cent say 
their workload has increased substantially in the past five years.

The poll found that 85 per cent of 
GPs think general practice is 'in crisis', while half believe 'GPs can 
no longer guarantee safe care to their patients'.

The survey, conducted by Research Now in June, also revealed that 22 per cent of family doctors have had to seek support, guidance or advice for work-related stress, and that four in five GPs are more likely to want to quit the profession than they were five years ago.
