The Arctic blast which has swept Britain could kill one person every seven minutes a charity has warned, with temperatures set to plummet even further and yet more snow on the way.

Almost a million elderly people are at risk from the bitter cold as they cannot afford to heat their homes, Age UK warned.

But the big freeze is expected to continue throughout the weekend and into Monday with the mercury forecast to drop as low as -15C following a night which saw six inches of snow fall in some parts of the country.

A blanket of snow covered much of the UK yesterday, with as much as six inches in parts of Cumbria and the Lake District, according to the Met Office.

Freezing temperatures were experienced by much of the nation as snow fell across most of Scotland, the north of England and the south-west. 

In Leeds, two constables had to pull a woman from the freezing River Aire last night. The 22-year-old woman was taken to hospital but sustained no serious injuries. A police spokesman said the 'quick thinking and commitment' of the officers prevented a tragedy. 

The Chilterns, Cotswolds and the Pennines were also hit by snow, while gritters were out once more to deal with ice on the roads, with the south told to expect more 'wintry showers' and a dusting of snow last night.

Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said the cold would put almost a million elderly people at risk as they cannot afford to heat their homes.

'The cold weather can be particularly dangerous for older people who are more at risk of suffering health problems when the temperature drops,' she said.

'It's a shocking fact that this winter one older person could die every seven minutes from the cold.

'With just under one million older people living in fuel poverty, many simply cannot afford to heat their homes to a temperature high enough to keep warm and well.

'We are calling for the Government to commit to improving the energy efficiency of homes across the country in order to provide a long-lasting solution to the scandal of fuel poverty and preventable winter deaths.'

Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl said temperatures plunged to -6.5C near Inverness overnight, but that the cold would only get worse today with temperatures dropping to -15C tonight.

He said: 'The wintry showers will go in Scotland on Saturday night, but they will be replaced by clear skies on Sunday, shortly after dusk.

'We could be in for minus double digits in Scotland, perhaps even -15C. In high ground further south, for instance the Pennines, we could be looking at -10C.

'Tonight we'll see more wintry showers - a mixture of sleet and snow - with southern England could get a bit of a dusting.

'North and western areas will see wet snow and sleet, while the south-west may get snow as it comes in from west to east.

'There will be a severe frost across the north and most of Scotland with temperatures of around -8C in places tonight.' 

Dr Angie Bone, from Public Health England, warned vulnerable people to keep themselves warm over the weekend as the cold bites.

She said: 'When indoors, have plenty of warm food and drinks to stay warm and try to maintain indoor temperatures to at least 18C, particularly if you are not mobile, have long-term illness or are 65 or over.'

Icy conditions led to more crashes on the roads yesterday in Dorset, where the A35 Upton bypass was shut because of 'nightmare' conditions.

There were also reports of a crash between a lorry and cars around Lytchett, near Poole, and a truck is blocking the road after its tyres could not grip the icy surface on steep hill near the village.

Public transport was not faring much better in the south-west, with no trains running between Bournemouth and Weymouth because of icy rails.

Bus drivers in Plymouth were also warned not to pick up passengers queueing at some stops because of the dangerous ice. 

And the travel chaos is likely to affect the Monday morning commute because of the freeze expected tonight. 

Yesterday the Met Office issued a level three amber alert - the second highest - for the North East and the North West of England as well as Yorkshire and Humber last night, with average temperatures set to fall below 2C.

The deep freeze brought 2cm and 6cm of snow in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the north of England throughout last night and the early hours of tonight, with snow expected further south soon.

Met Office forecaster Laura Young said the cold weather was set to continue for the rest of the weekend.

She said: 'It doesn't really warm up in Scotland and northern parts of England all weekend, so there is a very good potential for ice on Sunday. People really need to be aware of that.

'Basically, snow and sleet, then it becomes very, very clear, but then the temperatures really drop, and then it freezes.'
