Theresa May is concerned Yahoo's planned relocation could prevent British counter-terrorism experts gaining access to users' information

Theresa May is concerned that Yahoo’s planned move to Dublin could prevent British counter-terrorism experts gaining access to users’ information.

The home secretary has reportedly called for an urgent meeting with executives from the internet giant - whose European base is currently in London - to talk about security.

If the relocation of the firm’s headquarters goes ahead, Yahoo would not have to comply with British surveillance laws, such as handing over information demanded by intelligence agencies and Scotland Yard, The Guardian reported.

This information can currently be obtained using Britain’s anti-terror law, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) and this has caused Yahoo to be concerned about keeping its millions of users’ information private.

Among the disclosures in documents leaked by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden, were reports that GCHQ intercepted and stored the images of millions of people using Yahoo webcams.

Yahoo said that that the British intelligence agency's actions were ‘a whole new level of violation of our user’s privacy’.

It was also claimed that the NSA had secretly tapped into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centres around the world and Yahoo has promised to add enhanced encryption technology to its email service.

Experts said that the UK’s anti-terror law gives police and spooks too much access to people’s personal online material.

Now Chares Farr, the head of the office 
for security and counter-terrorism (OSCT) has reportedly put pressure on
 Theresa May to talk to Yahoo about the effect of its move to Dublin.

A Whitehall source told The Guardian: ‘There are concerns in the Home Office about how Ripa will apply to Yahoo once it has moved its headquarters to Dublin.’

‘The home secretary asked to see officials from Yahoo because in Dublin they don't have equivalent laws to Ripa. This could particularly affect investigations led by Scotland Yard and the national crime agency. They regard this as a very serious issue.’

The Dublin move was announced by the company last month and Yahoo said that the decision was driven by ‘business needs’.

A Yahoo spokesman told MailOnline: 'In line with the expansion of our Irish operations announced last year, we have made the decision to streamline our operations further and therefore, as of March 21, the services for all our European users will be provided by Yahoo EMEA in Ireland. 

'Yahoo is committed to expanding its operations internationally. To that end, Yahoo strives to make its business operations efficient and flexible. The recent notification of change to the provision of products is part of that drive.

'We can confirm that we have no plans to close any of our European operations and are committed to driving growth for Yahoo in EMEA.'

Following the claims that GCHQ collected images of millions of people using Yahoo webcams, Yahoo said it is ‘committed to preserving our users trust and security and continue our efforts to expand encryption across all of our services.’

It dubbed the intelligence agency’s actions: ‘completely unacceptable’ and called for reform of anti-terror laws.

Edward Snowden claimed that the NSA secretly tapped into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centres around the world.

Both Google and Yahoo said they would boost encryption technology for their email services to make it harder for surveillance agencies to intercept messages.

Google and Yahoo have spoken out against the U.S. government's spy programmes. They are worried more people will reduce their online activities if they believe almost everything they do is being monitored by the government. A decline in Internet use could hurt the companies financially by giving them fewer opportunities to show online ads and sell other services.

The NSA has said it only focuses on targets with foreign intelligence value.
