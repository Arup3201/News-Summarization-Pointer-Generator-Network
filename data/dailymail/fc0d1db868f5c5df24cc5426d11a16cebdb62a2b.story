Calum Chambers has revealed he and former Southampton team-mate Luke Shaw have been enjoying a bit of 'banter' ahead of Saturday's clash between Arsenal and Manchester United.

Chambers left Southampton for Arsene Wenger's side during the summer in a £16million deal, while Shaw moved from the south coast to United for £31m.

Saturday will be the first time the pair have lined up against each other and 19-year-old Chambers admitted that he and Shaw were discussing the match while on international duty with England.

'We're good friends,' Chambers told Arsenal Player. 'I've been with him for the past week and a half having a bit of banter with him about it. It will be a good test for both of us.

'It will be a bit weird playing against each other – the only time we have has been in training in 11 v 11, so it'll be a good test for both of us.

'He's a very big talent. He's a quality player and you can see that from last season. He had a fantastic season and he's having a good season so far this time around. He's a class player and everyone should be able to see that.

'I've just got to work out what his weaknesses are, so I'll be analysing him. You've just got to play your best against him, concentrate on your game and work on his weaknesses.'
