It has been taken by the Chinese for hundreds of years to ward off flu.

And now scientists have shown that an ingredient in honeysuckle tea actually acts like a ‘viral penicillin’ to beat influenza.

For the first time, scientists have shown a natural product can directly target the virus, which rapidly evolves and mutates to become resistant to vaccines.

Antibiotics have until now been the ‘magic bullets’ against most infections. But the discovery that a natural product can work in the same way promises to herald new treatments for the virus.

Honeysuckle is a popular garden plant with highly perfumed flowers. There are approximately 180 species around the world, of which at least two are native to the UK and more than half of the rest to China.

Researchers from the Nanjing University School of Life Sciences in China found that a compound in the plant, called MIR2911, directly targets influenza A viruses.

The seasonal flu that hits millions of Britons every winter is a strain of either influenza A or B.

The severe pandemics that occasionally strike around the world, including swine flu and bird flu, are particularly dangerous strains of influenza A.

In experiments on mice, various types of influenza A were effectively targeted by the honeysuckle compound.

Ongoing tests also showed that it may work against Ebola virus, the study published in Cell Research found.

Herbalists have also used honeysuckle for its anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and calming properties.

So-called Japanese honeysuckle has been used in Chinese medicine to not only treat flu and fevers, but also diarrhoea and skin infections.
