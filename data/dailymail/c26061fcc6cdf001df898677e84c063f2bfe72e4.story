Russia and Qatar have been cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after a corruption probe ruled there were no grounds for reopening the controversial bidding process.

But there was severe embarrassment for England after the world governing body's ethics committee launched a scathing attack over its doomed bid for the 2018 event.

The verdict by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert on the investigation into the murky World Cup bids concludes that Qatar and Russia did not do anything that warranted stripping them of the tournament.

Astonishingly, he reserved his strongest language for the England campaign, reprimanding its attempts to woo the support of disgraced former FIFA committee member Jack Warner.

He also criticised England for a $55,000 (£35,000) sponsorship of a gala dinner, but let Qatar off lightly for a similar $1.8million (£1.1million) deal.

Russia and Qatar (announced, above, by FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2010) have been cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after a corruption probe ruled there were no grounds for reopening the bids

Eckert's long-awaited findings accused England on a number of occasions of 'damning the integrity of the bidding process and the image of FIFA' in chasing Warner's vote.

England 2018 were reprimanded for finding a job for a friend of Warner, hosting a Caribbean Football Union dinner, setting up a training camp for a Trinidad Under-20 team and offering help to Warner's Joe Public football side.

The 42-page summary by the chairman of FIFA's ethics adjudicatory chamber into 430-page report by New York lawyer Michael Garcia will cause considerable embarrassment to the FA as well as anger. 

Relationships between the FA and FIFA, already at rock bottom, will take a long time to recover from these findings.

The FA considered their bid for the 2018 World Cup to be the most transparent of the nine countries involved and the monies spent on the breaches of bidding regulations listed by Eckert are a fraction compared with Qatar's spending.

England have been criticised for trying to woo disgraced former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner

Lord Triesman was FA Chairman from 2008-10 and 2018 CEO Andy Anson led the bidding process

And while some countries, especially 2018 hosts Russia, were highly unco-operative with Garcia's investigation, England look to have suffered for being so open about all their bid activity.

An FA spokesman said: 'We strongly refute any suggestions of impropriety by those involved in the England bid.'

And Conservative MP Damian Collins said FIFA's report is a whitewash, adding: 'FIFA are trying to con people that there has been a proper independent inquiry when there hasn't been'. 

As expected, Eckert names and shames Warner, the biggest rogue in the FIFA gallery who has resigned all his football positions. 

Despite England's lavishing attention on him and him promising his support to Prince William and PM David Cameron in person, Warner reneged on his vote.

Also singled out is Qatari Mohamed bin Hammam, who has been banned from football for life. 

But Eckert rules that his cash for votes bribes activity was connected with his aborted bid for the FIFA presidency rather than the 2022 World Cup bid.

And a further blow to the FA's reputation will be former FA chairman Lord Triesman being named by Eckert for not co-operating – due to legal reasons – with Garcia's investigation.

Qatar spent $1.8m on sponsoring the African confederation CAF's Congress in 2010. 

Eckert said that created a 'negative impression but the circumstances were not suited to affect the integrity of the FIFA World Cup.'

And in conclusion about Qatar, whose hosting of the tournament in 2022 has been mired in controversy since the December 2010 vote in Zurich, Eckert writes: 'The potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the Qatar 2022 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the World Cup 2018/2022 bidding process as a whole.'

The same wording is used to clear England of 'all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the World Cup bidding process.'

But nevertheless, Eckert went into a lot more detail about England's transgressions and the 'potentially problematic conduct of certain individuals in the light of relevant FIFA ethics rules.'

And Eckert passes the buck back to Garcia's investigatory chamber to take 'appropriate steps of it deems such measures appropriate and feasible.' This means that Garcia has full independence to discipline specific individuals involved in the England bid.

Eckert reported that the England team 'often accommodated Mr Warner's wishes in apparent violation of bidding rules and the FIFA code of ethics.'

The first transgression was 'to help a person of interest to him find a part-time job in the UK and not only provided the individual concerned with employment opportunities but also kept Mr Warner apprised of their efforts as they solicited his support for the bid.

'And England 2018 gave the appearance that it sought to confer a personal benefit on Mr Warner in order to influence his vote.'

England also provided 'substantial assistance' to setting up a training camp for an Under 20 Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation in the UK in the summer of 2009 in response to Mr Warner's 'improper demands.'

Warner also asked for favours and benefits around his Trinidad team the Joe Public Football Team and email correspondence showed that 'England football offocials appeared willing to do so.'

Eckert said Warner repeatedly used his power in FIFA as a vice-president on the executive committee and the CONCACAF confederation overlord to exact personal benefits in violation of the FIFA code of ethics. And that 'England 2018's response showed a willingness, time and again, to meet such expectation, thereby damaging the image of FIFA and the bidding process.'

The fourth England misdemeanour highlighted by Eckert was sponsoring a gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union at its annual Congress in Trinidad in 2010 'once again in an effort to curry favour' with Warner.

'The relevant support amounted to $55,000 suggested by Mr Warner. The England bid team bowed to that pressure because of Mr Warner's potential vote and in this way damaged the integrity of the bidding process.'

England were also mentioned for agreeing a memorandum of understanding with the Oceania Football Confederation led by President Reynald Temarii, later banned from the FIFA ExCo after accepting bribes in a newspaper sting, for development projects.

Eckert writes that that England 2018 granted Mr Temarii 'considerably preferential treatment in terms of allocating football development projects.'

Lord Triesman is singled out for speaking out at a Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting under privilege about unethical conduct by four FIFA ExCo members making improper requests for favours from the England bid team.

But Triesman, who resigned in May 2010 as FA and England bid chairman, was criticised by Eckert for waiting until after the vote before making is accusations and not helping the Garcia investigation.

And Eckert had yet another jibe at England saying they had 'accommodated or at least attempted to satisfy the improper requests made by these Executive Committee members, thereby jeopardising the integrity of the bidding process.'

Other countries get off remarkably lightly for what seem far more serious breaches. Spain, one of England 2018's rivals, are hardly mentioned apart from the fact they were 'highly unco-operative.' 

And Russia 'made only a limited amount of documents available'. 

This was explained by the computers used during the bid having been leased. They were then returned to the owner and subsequently destroyed along with any email trails.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter, the great survivor who set to be voted in for a fifth term next May, escapes blame and Eckert says he, 'deserves credit for the cooperation FIFA demonstrated throughout this investigation.'

But Eckert, in almost his only show of true independence, supports the term limits for the FIFA president that the body's congress rejected in 2014.
