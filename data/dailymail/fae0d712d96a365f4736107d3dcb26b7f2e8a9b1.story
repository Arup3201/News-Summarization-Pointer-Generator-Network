A set of Lego instructions dating back to 1974 has emerged online which gently urged parents not to slap gender stereotypes onto their children.

The pamphlet, which was posted to Reddit on Saturday and won widespread praise, reads: 'To parents... A lot of boys like dolls houses. They're more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They're more exciting than dolls houses.'

It concludes: 'The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.'

Winning praise: A photo of a set of Lego instructions dating back to 1974 was posted to Reddit which gently urged parents not to slap gender stereotypes onto their children

The uplifting instructions were posted by Reddit user Fryd_, who claims it was found it at his or her partner's grandmother's house. Initially, the photo aroused suspicions that it was fake, but Lego has since confirmed its authenticity.

In a statement made to io9, a company representative said: 'The text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of LEGO doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up from the 1970’s.

'The text remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world.'

Despite a great deal of approval for the 1974 instructions, however, many commentators argue that these gender-neutral ideals are no longer a part of the brand's DNA.

Popular angle: A Lego advert from the early 80s for 'Universal Building Sets' also positions itself as a brand for girls and boys alike

'It's too bad Lego products are now packaged and marketed to specific gender roles,' one Twitter user wrote in response to a photo of the pamphlet.

'They seem to have lost their way over the last 15 years,' echoed another.

Indeed, the Danish-founded company, which was launched in 1932, has landed itself in hot water a number of times in the past few years over issues of gender equality.

In 2011, it debuted its very pink-dominated Lego Friends range, aimed at girls, which came with ads including such strap-lines as, 'Cupcakes are ready!' and 'Time to chill with the girls at the beauty shop!'

Times have changed: Lego sparked much criticism when it launched its girl-targeted Lego Friends collection in 2011 for its patronizing gender stereotyping 

Turn-around: The company then released its 'Research Institute' collection in August (pictured), featuring a female chemist, paleontologist and astronomer, which sold out in a matter of days

Earlier this year, a seven-year-old American girl called Charlotte Benjamin wrote a letter to Lego which promptly went viral. 

In it, Charlotte complains of the few 'girl' Lego characters, writing: 'All the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs.

She added: 'But the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people... even swam with sharks.'

Following an apology from Lego, the company released its 'Research Institute' collection in August, featuring a female chemist, paleontologist and astronomer.

None of the characters, it should be noted, wore pink; and the $19.99 set sold out in a matter of days.
