Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect after the International Cricket Council ruled that his action was illegal.

Tests undertaken at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough revealed that Hafeez's action exceeded the 15 degrees level permitted under ICC regulations.

The 34-year-old off-spinner was reported after the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi in November, which Pakistan won by 248 runs.

'The International Cricket Council today confirmed that an independent analysis has found the bowling action of Pakistan's Mohammad Hafeez to be illegal and, as such, the off-spinner has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect,' an ICC statement read.

'The analysis revealed that all his deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.

'Hafeez, who was reported after the first Test match against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi last month, can apply for a re-assessment after he has modified his bowling action in accordance with clause 2.4 of the Regulations for the Review of Bowlers Reported with Suspected Illegal Bowling Actions.'

Hafeez, who has played 40 Tests and 149 one-day internationals for Pakistan, is the second Pakistan player to be suspended for an illegal bowling action this year after Saeed Ajmal was sanctioned in September.

Pakistan play New Zealand in Dubai on Monday in the first of five one-day internationals.
