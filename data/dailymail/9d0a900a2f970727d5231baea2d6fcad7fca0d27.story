Terrified plane passengers suffered a nightmare scenario when a cargo door opened mid-flight.

The Flybe plane suffered a dramatic loss of cabin pressure and slowed alarmingly en route from Aberdeen to the Shetland Isles yesterday afternoon.

The pilot was forced to divert to the Orkney Islands, where the 17 shaken passengers were met by emergency services.

A coastguard helicopter was scrambled and put on standby but the pilot managed to land safely at Kirkwall Airport on the Orkney Islands where it landed at 12.30pm yesterday.

Inspectors found a faulty rear cargo door and the plane, a Saab 340B, was grounded. Another aircraft was sent from Aberdeen to collect the passengers.

Oil worker James Jamieson, who was heading home to Shetland from a North Sea rig, said: 'I'd just got a cup of tea and a biscuit and the plane slowed really drastically.

'It didn't nose-dive, but it slowed an awful lot. You knew you were in the middle of the flight and it shouldn't have been slowing down as quickly as this.

'You immediately knew something was up,' he added.

'The plane was having to decelerate really quickly.

'The next indication was the air host - he ran up the cabin pretty quickly checking everybody's seatbelt. Then you got a bit more worried.'

He told how passengers tried to remain calm as they waited for information from the flight deck.

'Probably only a minute or two went by,' said Mr Jamieson.

'There was no real information, you were just looking around.

'They came on a few minutes later and said they had lost cabin pressure because a cargo door had opened mid-flight and we were diverting to Kirkwall.

'There were a few anxious-looking faces. But as soon as we got that reassurance from the guys on the flight deck, you knew there was nothing really to worry about,' he said.

'I think the door had only opened a fraction, or not been fully closed - just enough probably to lose pressure.'

The flight was being operated by Loganair.

A spokesman for the airline said: 'Flight BE 6774, which departed Aberdeen at 11.55am bound for Sumburgh Airport carrying three crew and 17 passengers, was diverted to Kirkwall following the activation of a cabin de-pressurisation warning light.

'There was an issue with the cargo door at the rear of the aircraft.

'Our crew followed the correct procedures and the aircraft landed safely at Kirkwall Airport at 12.30pm, where it was met by emergency services as a precaution.

'A secondary aircraft was flown up from Aberdeen to transport the passengers.

'A full inspection of the aircraft is currently being carried out by our engineering team,' the spokesman said.
