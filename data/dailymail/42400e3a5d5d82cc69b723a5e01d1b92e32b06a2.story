Louis van Gaal has insisted Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera were on his radar before Manchester United signed them - and said he gave his approval for both deals to be completed.

Herrera, 24, became the first signing of the Van Gaal era after joining from Athletic Bilbao for £28.4million, and Shaw's £30m move followed soon after, the England international penning a four-year contract at Old Trafford.

In his first United press conference on Thursday afternoon, Van Gaal said: 'Shaw and Herrera were already on the list. I gave my approval because I like them.

'My method is always the same – I want to look at the players I have now.

‘I want to see in the first few weeks what they can do. Maybe then I shall buy others players.

‘I want to see the (current) players perform with my philosophy.’

Van Gaal took his first training session at United's Carrington training complex on Thursday morning.

The former Bayern Munich coach said a player's age does not necessarily mean they lack experience, with some having questioned the purchases of 24-year-old Herrera and 18-year-old Shaw.

'I’m not always convinced of the experience of players,' he explained.

‘I have said a lot of times, a boy like Clarence Seedorf, he was 16, I let him make his debut [at Ajax].

‘Sometimes he was more experienced than a player of 30 – it depends on the personality.

'You mentioned Wayne Rooney, but there is, for example, Michael Carrick. He is injured, that is in my opinion a big blow because he is an experienced player.

‘So we need experience, not only in age, but also as a human being.

‘My philosophy is not only the football player but the total.'
