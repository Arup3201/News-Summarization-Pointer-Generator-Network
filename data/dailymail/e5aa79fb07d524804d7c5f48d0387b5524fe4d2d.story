The married maths teacher who has fled to Europe with his 15-year-old pupil had a new tattoo of a girl added to his arm over the summer - in what could be a tribute to Megan Stammers.

Jeremy Forrest's bold body art is of a young woman in a feathered hat holding a dog on a lead and was inked after their inappropriate relationship had started around seven months ago.

Stretching downwards and across his left arm, it shows a girl with long dark hair with a reddish tint - strikingly similar to Megan's own hair.

He proudly unveiled his 'tatt' on his own Twitter account over the summer while on his school holidays.

Distinctive: Forrest had this image of a young 
girl wearing a hat and walking a dog (left) tattooed on his arm earlier 
this year,  which could have been designed to look like Megan Stammers (right)

The other side of his arm is covered in pink flowers with a message in black letters that cannot be read from his online photo. 

On his right arm he already has two other tattoos - a design involving red roses and also a star.

It was revealed today that Jeremy and Megan fled when police started investigating their relationship last week.

Tribute? The tattoo could be a tribute to Megan - as the girl in the body art has long dark reddish hair - just like the missing schoolgirl

Officers spoke to them and are believed to have taken their mobile phones but details of their investigation is currently being kept private.

Their school and the local council were also looking into it when they ran away on a cross-Channel ferry.

The teenager left her 
home in Eastbourne last Thursday afternoon after telling her mother she 
was going to stay overnight at a friend’s house.

Her school raised the alarm after she 
and Forrest failed to turn up the next day and CCTV later caught the 
teacher’s black Ford Fiesta heading to Dover with Megan in the passenger
seat.

First pictures: These stills taken from CCTV 
camera footage filmed aboard a Dover to Calais ferry last Thursday show 
30-year-old teacher Jeremy Forrest with his arm round runaway schoolgirl
Megan Stammers in one picture and walking hand in hand with her in the 
other - the last time they were seen

The images of the couple on the ferry –
Forrest in jeans and tracksuit top, Megan in short black skirt – were 
made public in the hope of encouraging witnesses to come forward with 
information about their possible whereabouts.

But there has not been a single 
sighting of the pair anywhere in France and no trace of them using their
mobile phones or accessing cash machines, according to the French 
authorities.

Police have admitted they could 'be anywhere in Europe' by now.
