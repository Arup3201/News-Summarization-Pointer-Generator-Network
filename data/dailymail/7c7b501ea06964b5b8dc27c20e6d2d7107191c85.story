2014 has been Quvenzhané Wallis's year - the actress has been revealed as the face of Armani Junior for a second time.

The 11-year-old poses in a stripey dress for the advert photo, jumping playfully for the camera. 

The star is an experienced hand at wearing the designer's clothing now - as well as an ad campaign last spring, where she was pictured wearing a tuxedo, Quvenzhané has also worn Giorgio Armani on the red carpet at awards ceremonies and premieres.

She told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year that she was honoured to be chosen as an Armani fashion ambassador, saying: 'I was honored to wear his custom gown to the Oscars, it made me feel like a princess.

'When I saw Mr. Armani's Prive show in New York, the dresses were so pretty... I had too many favorites. Afterwards when I met him, I realized Mr Armani is such a nice man. I liked that that he was so thoughtful.

'It's fun to wear Armani Junior since I really like the clothes. It's young. It's cool. My friends are going to want to borrow all my clothes.' 

Quvenzhané is well on her way to becoming a screen legend.

The 11-year-old star, who is the youngest Academy Award Best Actress nominee, recently chatted with Elle magazine about her role as Little Orphan Annie in the updated film adaptation of the classic story.

Also in the January issue of the publication, the Beasts Of The Southern Wild actress grappled with the inevitable reality that she won't be a child forever.

'I don't want to grow up, but I know it's not going to last much longer,' she revealed.

Many critics have dubbed Quvenzhané as the next leading child actor and she is surely proving them right. 

But the young starlet admitted she has moments where she just wants to act like a kid.

'I feel like I'm five sometimes, because I still enjoy myself,' she said. 'I enjoy what I do.'

Spoken like a veteran actress she explained: 'I just keep doing what I'm doing and don't ever give up. That's what I like about Annie. If she has goals, she'll finish them, like me. We're both confident.'

And that confidence is what landed her the leading role of the film.

Originally, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith signed on as producers for Annie with plans of their 14-year-old daughter Willow to play the role of the orphan girl, but director Will Gluck had other ideas.

The initial requirements Gluck was looking for in the leading lady were: 'Someone close to Annie's actual age, 11; someone plucky, smart, and on the hustle; and someone 50 per cent hardened and 50 per cent endlessly generous with their heart - two things that don't often go together.'

'[Quvenzhané] was dropped down from heaven,' he gushed to Elle about casting her in the film. 'She has a face that can do anything.'

The apparent difference between the past Annie adaptations is that the lead is a Caucasian young woman, however Gluck knew that Quvenzhané was destined to play the part.

Adding: 'We just wanted a modern girl. And when you see the movie, it's not about her race. It's just about a headstrong girl who cares about everyone around her. And that's Quvenzhané.'

Gluck wasn't the only one blown away by Quvenzhané's amazing acting abilities, actor Jamie Foxx, her on-screen father Will Stacks, present day 'Daddy' Warbucks, thought so too.

'She brought so much talent and charisma to set,' he proudly told Elle.

'Quvenzhané was made to play this role. I'm convinced it was in her DNA,' he added.
