It is a terrifying skull a foot long and containing 700 razor sharp teeth.

Yet rather than being a prehistoric monster from the deep, this incredible head was actually found in Oxfordshire - and belongs to the biggest pike ever found in Britain.

The grisly fish carcass was found in the undergrowth next to the River Cherwell by farmer Peter Mone.

Skull found by a farmer near the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire is thought to be from a 20-year-old northern pike fish. Angling experts believe it would have weighed a record-breaking 50lbs - the current UK record stands at 46lbs

The pike skull found by the River Cherwell is a foot-long. It has around 700 razor-sharp teeth that are about an inch long. Peter Money, who made the discovery, initially thought it belonged to a dead deer

Money initially thought it was a dead
deer, but when he got closer he realised the foot-long elongated skull
belonged to a enormous pike.

Money believes the pike was washed out of the river in a flood.

He measured and photographed the skull and showed it to angling expert Andrew Crisp.

Crisp has never seen a pike skull bigger than this before, and believes it comes from the biggest pike in the country.

The skull is 9ins wide and has around 700 teeth.

Some of the teeth are an inch long.

It is thought the pike was about 20 years old when it died and would have weighed over 50lbs.

A tape measure is shown in this image to demonstrate the length of the foot-long skull. A ten pence piece is also used to see the skull in scale. This image shows the underside of the skull and the pike's spine

The pike's skull was found in undergrowth by the side of the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire. Angling angling expert Andrew Crisp believes that the fish may have washed ashore following a flood. It is thought to be Britain's biggest pike and would have beaten the current record by 4lbs

The current pike record stands at 46lb for a catch from Wykeham Lakes near Scarborough, which was caught in March last year by 20-year-old Andy O'Conner.

Peter Money, 32, said: 'I was in the tractor with my boss Charlie Gee and we were checking some of our fences.

'We saw what looked like bones in the
grass and I thought it was a deer or something, so I got out and then 
realised it was a pike skull straight away, it was massive.

'I think it must have been swept onto the bank in the floods and died when the water went down.

'I'm not a fisherman but I know when I
have spotted something big and as I live on the river I know what is in
it, and I haven't seen anything like this before.

'I measured it and then took the skull to Andrew.

Pike fish have up to 700 teeth including some that point backwards to stop prey from escaping once they have clamped their jaws shut. Pike are able to stay still in the water by moving the last fin rays of the dorsal fins and the breast fins. Before attacking their prey, they bend their body and dart out to the prey using the large surface of tail fin, dorsal fin and anal fin to propel themselves

The northern pike, or esox lucius, is a freshwater game fish. They mainly live in the northern hemisphere. Female pikes are usually larger than males, and the average weight is around 18lbs. The skull discovered by the River Cherwell is thought to have weighed 50lbs

'I have showed it to a few friends and the ones who know about fishing are quite excited about it because it would have been a huge pike when it was alive.'

It is not known how long it was out the water for but its body had been stripped, probably by foxes.

Andrew Crisp, secretary for the North Oxford Angling Society, said he had never seen a pike so big before.

He said: 'Peter brought the skull around to me and I thought it was amazing.

Andy O'Conner currently holds the record for catching the UK's biggest pike. The pike, pictured with Andy, weighed 46lbs. It is not the biggest pike found in the world, though. The heaviest pike was found in Germany in 1986 weighing 55lbs

'We measured it and it was 1ft long and 9ins across, and what was left of the vertebrae was at least 1ins around.

'I'm no pike expert but this could have weighed at least 40lbs when it was alive, probably more. The record is 46lbs and it could have been as big as that.'

Pike fish have up to 700 teeth, some of which point backwards to stop any prey from escaping once they have clamped their jaws shut.

The word 'pike' is derived from the French 'pique, meaning 'spear'.

The world's biggest pike, weighing 55lb 1oz, was caught in Grefeern, Germany in 1986.

Pike have sandpaper-like tongues which they use to turn larger prey around so they can be swallowed head-first.

There have been tales of large pike pulling small dogs into the water.

In 2004, a boy of 11 needed eight stitches in his hand and three in his foot when he was bitten by a pike in Minnesota.

Fossils suggest pike have changed very little in 20 million years.

The larger the pike is, the more likely it is to be female.

Pike can live for up to 50 years.
