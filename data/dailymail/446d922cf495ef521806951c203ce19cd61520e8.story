Tory MP Robert Halfon will address Parliament tomorrow in the debate about the Corporation's future

The BBC licence fee is a ‘medieval anachronism’ and can only be justified if those who pay it elect the chairman and board, have a more direct say on programme-making and an input on celebrity pay, MPs will hear today.

Tory MP Robert Halfon will argue the licence fee is a ‘coercive system backed up by the threat of fines and prison’ in a backbench business committee debate on the Corporation’s future.

Mr Halfon believes the fact that fee-payers have little input into how the Corporation is run makes the BBC as undemocratic as a ‘feudal monarchy.’

A debate in parliament on the 
Corporation’s future will hear that public trust in the BBC has been 
eroded by the Jimmy Savile and severance pay scandals. 

The debate will hear that in order to win back public trust, the 
licence fee should be reformed so fee payers are treated like 
shareholders in a business they have invested in.

Under proposals, Mr Halfon will suggest today people who pay the £145.50 a year licence fee should be allowed a vote on both the election of the chairman and the board.

They would have some say over the 
annual report, programme making and celebrity pay, and the ability to 
call for board members who have ‘grown out of touch with public opinion’
to be sacked.

While there 
is a statutory requirement to consult its licence fee payers, Mr Halfon 
said this process is in reality a ‘sham’ as most of the decisions they 
are consulted on, are made well in advance.

The MP calls for a new system
whereby the public are able to cast a vote online using a unique pin 
number, as a cheap way to ‘democratise’ the BBC for viewers and 
listeners.

He said it would also help to ‘spark a genuine debate - a battle of ideas-about the kind of BBC that we want, and how it should spend our money’.

'The BBC is monopolistic, with about a third of TV viewing and half of radio, it is often branded as anti-competitive because it does not have to make a commercial return on its products, and the licence fee is a mediaeval anachronism’, he told the Mail.

Large staff payouts, such as those revealed by head of HR Lucy Adams, are cause for concern says Halfon

'Some might feel that the licence fee is a regressive tax which penalises those on low incomes.

'Others will be upset by the salaries of senior BBC executives and celebrities.

‘The reality is that licence fee payers want choice. Some might want a beefed-up World Service, paid for by reducing expense elsewhere - perhaps by cutting the £50,000 a day that the BBC spends on taxis.

‘At the moment we are powerless' he said, adding: 'As licence fee payers, we are compelled to pay our dues, and if we do not like that, our only choice is to abandon TV altogether.’

The BBC made £3.6billion from the licence fee in 2012/13.

It emerged this year that 3,700 a week were prosecuted for not having a TV licence - around one in ten of all cases coming before the courts in England and Wales.

They face fines of £1,000, compared with £80 spot fines handed to shoplifters, petty vandals and drunken yobs. It later emerged a private firm employed to catch licence fee evaders has hundreds of officers who can earn four-figure bonuses for them to court.

Yet BBC managers received £25milion in secret severance deals between 2009 and 2012, and nearly £3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012, according to an official report this year.

Mr Halfon will argue the Corporation has lost its viewers' trust in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal

A debate entitled ‘the Future of the BBC’ will be held this afternoon in the House of Commons by the backbench business committee, which represents rank and file MPs.

Mr Halfon said it was no longer acceptable to argue that giving the public a say would result in dumbing down of content.

‘Look at Classic FM and Sky News’, he said. ‘The BBC cannot continue-dare I say it-to be a kleptocracy, indifferent to the public who pay for it.

‘Auntie pays out huge salaries to executives and celebrities alike. Her bureaucracy grows exponentially. Her undemocratic licence fee has become an anachronism in the days of multi-channel satellite television.

‘If the BBC really does depend on the licence fee for its survival, then there must be some genuine checks and balances. What better way than democratising the licence fee?’

‘It would be similar to shareholders having the ability to hire and fire their board, but with one main difference-every licence fee payer would hold just one share and one vote.’
