Trail of blunders: Martynas Kupstys, shown with wife Sandra, tried to tell staff of their mistake but was still escorted from HMP Lincoln

A murder suspect was released from a high-security prison by mistake – as he waited in line to be taken to trial.

Bungling prison officers handed Martynas Kupstys his clothes and belongings and, despite his protests, said he had to leave.

The 25-year-old pleaded with HMP Lincoln that he should be joining inmates who were being escorted towards the prison bus to Lincoln Crown Court. But his pleas were ignored and he was shown the door.

It was only when the van reached court, and officials found Kupstys missing from the defendants that the astonishing error came to light.

A full-scale investigation was launched with police searching frantically for the prisoner.

Meanwhile, confused Kupstys had sat unnoticed at a bus stop outside the prison following his release. He remained there for three hours before being found and returned to custody.

His release led to the collapse of his murder trial, which had been hearing evidence for three weeks, at a cost to the taxpayer of an estimated £3,000 a day.

Last night the Ministry of Justice confirmed an urgent security review was under way at HMP Lincoln, a prison which has been heavily criticised as ‘unsafe’ by Government inspectors who raised concerns about overcrowding and staffing issues.

Last night, Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, told The  Mail on Sunday: ‘It is ridiculous and dangerous that a murder suspect was released during his trial.

‘I’ve never heard of this  happening before and I am deeply concerned. We should be relieved that Kupstys simply sat at a bus stop wondering why he had been pushed out the door. Thankfully nobody was hurt.

‘This error was expensive, because a lot of court time has been wasted.

‘This shocking incident is indicative of the fact that Britain’s prisons are in meltdown.

‘Across the country prison staffing levels have been cut and many of the remaining staff are overstretched and inexperienced.’

Married
 Lithuanian factory worker Kupstys, 25, and his brother-in-law Andrus 
Giedraitis, 29, were charged with murder earlier this year after Latvian
 Ivans Zdanovics, 24, was found dead at his home in Gainsborough, 
Lincolnshire, in January 2014. Police said he died from smoke 
inhalation.

While being held
 on remand at HMP Lincoln, Kupstys and Giedraitis, made a series of 
appearances before local magistrates and pleaded not guilty. Their trial
 began at Lincoln Crown Court on July 21.

The
 precise details of how he came to be released in error remain 
undisclosed but The Mail on Sunday understands that at around 8.30am on 
August 8 he was moved from his cell to a holding area where inmates are 
segregated according to whether they are going to court or being 
released because they have completed their sentences.

The confused prisoner waited at this bus stop opposite the jail for three hours while police officers searched for him

Due
 to an apparent mix-up with another inmate who had served his time, 
Kupstys was handed his possessions and led towards the front door.

At 
the time he tried to explain to prison officers that he should  be 
joining those prisoners, including his co-accused Giedraitis, who  were 
being escorted towards the prison bus.

His
 pleas were ignored and he was shown the door. Meanwhile Giedraitis and 
other remand prisoners boarded the bus at about 9am.

The bus arrived at 
Lincoln Crown Court, without Kupstys, at about 9.30am.  Concerned court 
officials called the prison where officers realised their embarrassing 
error.

The presiding judge,
 His Honour Michael Heath was informed that Kupstys had been released in
 error and the judge passed this information to the jury after they were
 sworn in at around 11am.

The case was then adjourned in Kupstys’s 
absence and Giedraitis was driven back to HMP Lincoln.

Kupstys was found at the bus stop by prison officers at around 12.30pm and was returned to his cell.

The
 jury in the case was discharged by Judge Heath on August 12 for legal 
reasons and the case will now return to court in March next year.

Kupstys’
 release is another blow for HMP Lincoln which was criticised by 
inspectors in 2012. They declared the prison unsafe after finding 
overcrowding at a rate of 50 per cent. A new governor was appointed and 
the prison received a more favourable report last year.

Last
 night, the governor Peter Wright admitted that Kupstys’s release was a 
‘grave error, a fundamental breach of what we’re here to do’.

A
 Ministry of Justice spokesman added: ‘A prisoner from Lincoln was 
released in error on 8 August. The police were notified immediately and 
he was arrested within hours. An investigation by a senior governor has 
been launched.

‘We take public protection extremely seriously and this type of incident is a very rare but regrettable occurrence.’

The Mail on Sunday won a legal victory to report this shocking breach of prison security.

On Friday this newspaper persuaded His Honour Judge Heath, pictured, to lift reporting restrictions which would have meant Kupstys’s release remained a state secret until at least March 2015.

We argued the freeing of a prisoner standing trial for murder was a matter of ‘overwhelming public interest’ which should be exposed now.

Judge Heath agreed, dismissing objections by Kupstys’s legal representatives and the  CPS. Prosecution Service.
