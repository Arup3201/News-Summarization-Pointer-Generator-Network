Passengers on a cross-country Greyhound bus have criticised the firm for allegedly exposing them to a deadly illness by allowing a sick man to travel alongside them.

Customers spent two days travelling from Los Angeles to Dallas with a fellow passenger who was coughing up blood and may have been suffering from tuberculosis.

The driver stopped the bus and called an ambulance - but paramedics said they were unable to test him for the disease and he was allowed to continue.

Passengers were apparently told that it would be pointless to exit the bus at that point as they had already been exposed to the ill man for so long.

Now they have spoken out, claiming that Greyhound should have taken better care of their health and done more to redress the problem.

The incident is reminiscent of a scene 
in the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy in which the health of character Rizzo,
played by Dustin Hoffman, seriously deteriorates over the course of a 
bus ride from New York to Miami. The character eventually passes away yet the bus driver continues the journey to Miami.

The sick man boarded the bus in Los Angeles on Saturday, according to CBS DFW, but his condition deteriorated during the journey to Texas.

'We noticed how sick he was and then he started coughing and hacking up blood,' passenger Erin Dent said.

By the time the bus was nearing its destination in Dallas, passengers demanded that the man should be forced to leave because he could infect them.

The Greyhound vehicle stopped in the 
town of Van Horn and the patient was examined by paramedics, who said it
would take two days to determine if he was suffering from TB.

Many of the passengers wanted to get off the bus because of the risk of infection, but paramedics said there was no need.

'I'd already been with him a day and a half,' Doreen Krueger said. 'The ambulance said it wouldn't make any difference if [I had] already been exposed.'

The ill man was told he could continue to ride the bus as long as he wore a mask, but according to some passengers the man was deaf and would not obey the instruction.

When the bus reached Dallas, customers were offered complaint forms by Greyhound, but they say that the company's response has been inadequate.

'If we've been exposed then everybody we come in contact with from now on can be exposed, so we're real concerned about our families,' Ms Dent told CBS.

Greyhound denied putting passengers in danger, saying that the driver followed correct protocol and the passenger wore a mask when asked to do so.

Local health officials have offered free TB tests to anyone who travelled on the bus.
