Millions of Europe's unemployed youth are moving to more wealthy countries in the European Union as they desperately try to find work. 

New figures have revealed that the number of Europeans who have moved to better off countries in the north to find work has doubled since the economic crises first hit four years ago, with Britain and Germany topping the list of choices.

Almost a quarter of the EU's under 25s  - some 5.6million - are now unemployed.

New figures have revealed that the number of Europeans who have moved to better off countries to find work has doubled to five million since the economic crises first hit four years ago, with Britain and Germany topping the list of choices.

Millions of Europe's unemployed youth are moving to more wealthy countries in the European Union as they desperately try to find work

The figures have been revealed in the latest EU Employment and Social Situation review, published by the European Commission.

Greeks, Bulgarians and Romanians are most likely to say they would like to move, according to the report.

And it showed Britain was the top choice for foreign workers from the EU looking for employment last year, with 37 per cent migrating for these shores as they searched for work. Germany was next with 28 per cent.

The two countries are by far the most popular destinations. Austria came third - but only saw six per cent of the total - and France came fourth with five per cent.

The report said in 2008 the number of people stating they wanted to move for work -  the beginning of the EU wide recession - was two million. This year the figure tops five million.

It said: 'Labour market and social challenges have been growing over recent months, as the EU is still faced with ever higher unemployment and the lowest employment figures since the onset of the crisis, according to the June edition of the EU Employment and Social Situation Quarterly Review.

'The situation of many households, and of young people in particular, remains serious.'

'The situation of young people remains grave, nearly a quarter of economically active young people in the EU being unemployed. Differences among countries are still substantial though.'

Britain has actively tried to play down expectations of people planning a new life here from eastern and southern Europe.

But Germany has actively attempted to lure promising workers from abroad after it decided to welcome well qualified workers from the south of Europe. Since the economic crises began, the country has seen the biggest increase in migration from other EU countries.

In 2007, it saw 575,000 migrants. By 2011, that figure had increased to 842,000.

The Times reports that demand for German language classes in southern Europe can barely be met.

Manfred Ewel, director of the Goethe Institute in Madrid, said attendance at German classes had increased more than 70 per cent in three years.

It comes after Brussels demanded Britain makes it easier for the unemployed from other European Union countries to find jobs here.

The EU Commission said that while some states suffer ‘much higher’ levels of unemployment, the rest of the EU should open their doors and help.

It wants new rules to force the Government to better advise migrants about their rights. They would also make it easier for unions and migrant groups to launch legal action if they think foreign workers are suffering discrimination.

But Prime Minister David Cameron’s aim is to prevent a sudden influx to the UK when EU migration restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians are lifted in January.

In Britain, 4.8 per cent of the labour force – 1.4million people – is already made up of migrants from other EU nations. This compares with 4 per cent in Germany, and just 2.4 per cent in France.

Demanding greater help for migrant workers, the EU employment and social affairs commissioner Laszlo Andor said in May: ‘The free movement of workers is a key principle of the EU’s single market.

‘With much higher levels of unemployment in some member states than others at the moment, it is all the more important to make it easier for those who want to work in another EU country to be able to do so.’
