Rangers have suffered a fresh financial blow after former goalkeeper Neil Alexander won a £80,000 claim against the club for breach of contract.

Lawyers for the cash-strapped Ibrox club will appeal the decision reached by an SPFL independent panel.

Alexander, now at Championship rivals Hearts, argued he was the victim of broken financial promises made during Charles Green’s tenure as chief executive.

Assisted by PFA Scotland and their lawyers, Alexander won his case. But a Rangers decision to appeal the matter via an SFA judicial panel will now see the costs of the action spiral as the club wrestle with a growing cash crisis.

Poised to announce plans to raise £8million for the club’s day-to-day running at what is sure to be a stormy AGM on Monday, Ibrox directors and lawyers will meet manager Ally McCoist today to discuss his departure.

McCoist, whose side are nine points adrift of Hearts in the Championship promotion race, has already tendered his resignation and plans to serve 12-months’ notice.

However, a Rangers statement to the stock market confirmed plans for an ‘amicable settlement’ during talks due to take place today.

The options for Rangers are a pay-off, a period of gardening leave or an improbable scenario where McCoist remains in his position for the next year on a £750,000 salary.

Alex Smith, chairman of the Scottish Managers and Coaches Association, hopes the parties can find a dignified end to an unparalleled stand-off.

‘It’s a very unusual situation and one that I think has to be resolved as soon as possible.

‘Hopefully they can try and get a solution to allow Ally to continue working there.

‘I think he has worked under tremendous pressure. He has been asked to do so many things outwith his remit as manager of Rangers.

‘He has had to take on all the flak that has been flying around since the situation happened three years ago, which was really difficult to do.

‘I would like it to be resolved amicably with everybody sitting round the table and coming away with their dignity intact.’

BLOB Queen of the South defender Andy Dowie has been offered a two-match suspension by the SFA for stamping on Rangers midfielder Ian Black during last Friday’s Championship clash. 

Charged with a breach of rule 200 which covers ‘committing violent conduct at a match by deliberately standing on an opposing player’s leg’ Dowie – who began his career at Ibrox - has until the end of today to respond. If he challenges the ruling he would face an SFA hearing on Thursday.
