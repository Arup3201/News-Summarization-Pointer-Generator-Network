Leader of the pack: Rusty Sherrill, 57, is the alleged orchestrator of the plot

A mother rescued her daughter from a house where three depraved captors had held and tortured her for eight months, it was revealed today.

Three men were arrested this week for holding the woman prisoner and repeatedly assaulting her in Winnie,Texas, last year.

Rusty Sherrill, 57, James Ruff, 23, and Max Ruff, 21, allegedly kidnapped the unnamed woman in September 2011 after her relationship with one of them ended, and held her captive and repeatedly assaulted her until May 2012.

The victim's mother rescued her daughter and took her to a hospital, officials revealed but did not provide further details of the rescue.

The beatings were so bad she remained in a coma for four weeks, a Chambers 
County Sheriff’s Office announcement first reported by the Houston Chronicle said.

‘Initially, it was a relationship between Sherrill and the female that went downhill,’ a sheriff’s office spokesperson told the Chronicle.

Counts against the trio vary, with apparent ringleader Mr Sherrill being charged with aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated kidnapping and impersonating a public servant, records showed.

Both Mssrs Ruff have been charged with aggravated assault, the complaint said.

The woman’s identity has not been released, her condition is unknown.

The case was reopened in August as deputies scoured cold cases and tracked down leads, the spokesperson told the Chronicle.

All three men remain in custody.
