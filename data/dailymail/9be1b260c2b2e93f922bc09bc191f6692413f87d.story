Its deep, inky blackness punctuated by the dazzling sparkles of thousands of distant suns, the night sky over the Brecon Beacons has long mesmerised stargazers.

Now the sky above the Welsh mountain range has won special protection to preserve it for future generations - becoming only the fifth place in the world to be saved from light pollution.

Prince Charles was among the high profile backers of the campaign for the Beacons to be granted the status of an 'international dark sky reserve'.

The park already has some of the Britain's darkest skies ideal for stargazing, but the new status means the night-sky is protected by regulations to prevent light pollution.

The Beacons join Mont Megantic in Quebec, Canada, Exmoor National Park in Devon, Aoraki Mackenzie in New Zealand, and NambiRand Nature Reserve in Namibia as the few regions of nocturnal beauty to be granted the status.

On a clear night above the Beacons stargazers can see the Milky Way, as well as a host of constellations, bright nebulae and even meteor showers.

Campaigners say it is a 'massive boost bringing environmental, wildlife, economic, tourism and wellbeing benefits.'

Astronomers carried out a survey to assess the levels of light pollution and lighting engineers audited the existing external lighting in the national park.

The new rules mean that people in the national park must take darkness measures such as tilting outdoor security lights downwards instead of up.

Martin Morgan-Taylor, of the International Dark-Sky Association, said: 'The best views of the night sky come from places such as the Brecon Beacons, who have dedicated themselves to protecting and restoring the night sky for all to enjoy.

'Whilst no-one wants all the lights to be switched off, we can improve the lighting we use in towns and cities.

'We are gradually losing the night to light pollution, which is eroding the view of the night sky, and fewer and fewer people are able to see the Milky Way from their back gardens.

'This is not just an aesthetic loss; it is a loss of part of our culture, and the children who would have become scientists if the spark of interest had been ignited by a view of the night sky.

'Light at night is also bad for animals and human health.'

Local families supported the bid - including people in Talybont-on-Usk who are holding their own 'Star Party' with a community light switch off.

Bob Mizon, UK Co-ordinator of the British Astronomical Association's Campaign for Dark Skies, said: 'For years most children and adults in this country have been robbed of their star-filled night skies.

'The light from distant stars and galaxies takes hundreds, thousands, even millions of years to reach us. What a pity to lose it in the last millisecond of its journey.

'I hope others will follow suit and help protect our precious dark skies, saving money and energy.'
