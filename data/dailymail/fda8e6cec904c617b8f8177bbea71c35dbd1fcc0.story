Singapore was fifty shades of blush this weekend, when thousands of people gathered for the Pink Dot parade in Hong Lim Park to celebrate being gay.

An unprecedented number of partygoers of all ages came out to support the event; part of global Gay Pride month in June, which celebrates liberation of all sexual orientation.

Around 26,000 revellers filled the park - the only place where public assemblies can take place without a permit.

Despite the mass gathering Singapore still has laws in place concerning homosexuality.

Section 377 of the Penal Code, which essentially criminalises homosexual acts and is still found in many areas of the Far East.

In Singapore, however, the ban on gay sex is not actively enforced – the government say that the law only keeps the law in place to reflect the stance of ‘mainstream society,’ according to the Huffington Post.

Because of the largely conservative views of the country, the Pink Dot parade is often faced with criticism, though this year it was all the more severe as the rally fell on the eve of Ramadan, prompting one Muslim teacher to start a Wear White campaign against homosexuality.

Backed by a Christian group, Wear White issued a statement saying no one should be associated with Pink Dot.

That didn’t deter the huge numbers that came out in force, mostly dressed in pink, brandishing plaques and balloons and supporting the gay rights movement.

June has been a dedicated Pride month since the Stonewall Inn riots in New York 45 years ago, on 28 June 1969. The protests are credited for launching the modern gay rights movement.

Celebrations were held all over the world this weekend, with parades everywhere from New York and San Francisco to Brazil and Tel Aviv.

And tens of thousands of Londoners braved the weekend rain to march, where David Cameron issued a statement of support.

He said: ‘I’m immensely proud to be the Prime Minster of the country which is the best place in Europe to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

‘But that doesn’t mean our job is done – we cannot be complacent.’

Pink Dot Sg is a non-profit movement in Singapore which support the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community.

The annual Pink Dot event is the closest thing the country has to a gay pride parade.
