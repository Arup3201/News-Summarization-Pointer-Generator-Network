A nursery worker had the shock of her life when she gave birth on her lunch break in the toilet.

Hannah Brown, 27, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was just 28 weeks pregnant when she had to deliver her own baby in the loo at work.

At three months premature, newborn April, now two months old, was rushed to Gloucester Royal Hospital to the intensive care unit.

After a nerve-racking two months, four weeks before Hannah's due date, Hannah and husband Kyle, 29, brought their healthy baby girl home.

Hannah, head of the baby unit at Tree Tops Nursery, said: 'I was having my lunch break with my colleagues when I felt really uncomfortable so I went to the toilet.

'I was on the loo when I knew I could feel the baby's head.

'I called for help for someone to get me an ambulance but there wasn't time.

'I could hear the sirens when April just whooshed out onto the floor.

'I was in such disbelief that I had given birth in the toilet at work.'

The premature baby was taken to hospital where her development was monitored, and thankfully, she was discharged from hospital after just eight weeks - four weeks before her due date.

She woke up and didn't feel quite herself but didn't think much of it, so went to work as usual

Hannah Brown had started the day in July just like any other, and went to work at Tree Tops Nursery which was celebrating its 25th anniversary.

She said: 'I woke up and didn't feel quite myself but I didn't think much of it and went to work.

'I'd had a scan the day before and everything was fine with the baby so I wasn't worried.

'But when I was having my lunch break with my colleagues I started to feel really uncomfortable.

'I went to the toilet and knew what was coming. I just thought, right, that's the head.'

Hannah called out for her colleagues who called 999 and her husband Kyle.

With the paramedics on the end of the line, Hannah delivered her baby in the toilet.

Hannah added: 'I could hear the sirens but April just whooshed out with such force her umbilical cord broke.

'I didn't know what to do I was in such shock.

'April was on the floor so my manager told me I better pick her up.

'I scooped her up and we waited for the paramedics.'

Hannah and April were taken by ambulance to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and April went straight into intensive care where eventually Kyle was able to join them.

Kyle said: 'I had a missed call on my mobile whilst Hannah was at work and by the time I had rang back she'd already had the baby.

'I was passed on to paramedics but my phone ran out of battery.

'I frantically packed a bag for Hannah and called Hannah's dad using the house phone and he came and picked me up.

'It was a complete and utter shock as there was no indication she was going to come so early.

'When I got to the hospital April was already in the intensive care unit and Hannah had already been checked over.'

April went straight into intensive care, and two months later the proud parents took her home

As April was three months early, doctors had to battle hard to keep her alive.

She was diagnosed with sleep apnoea and at five weeks old, April gave her parents the fright of their lives.

Kyle said: 'She stopped breathing for over 30 seconds. It was terrifying and we had talks about possible blood transfusions, but thankfully she pulled through. From that day onward, it was full steam ahead and she just got stronger every day.'

And after a rapid recovery, April shocked her parents again when she was allowed to come home one month before her original due date of October 10.

Kyle said: 'We didn't expected her to come home so early but she was doing amazingly well the doctors said they were struggling to find a reason to keep her in any longer.'

Hannah added: 'It was more of a shock that she was well enough to bring her home than her unexpected arrival.

'At hospital you live in a baby bubble so it is so nice to be home to start family life.'

And coming home was an extra special occasion for Hannah and Kyle. 

Last year, they lost their first born Finn who was still born at 32 weeks.

Kyle added: 'It was hard having delivered Finn that we were unable to bring him home and it was tough having to walk past the suite where he was born every time I went to visit April and Hannah in hospital.

'But although there have been difficult times before, we will never forget the little boy we had and the day we brought April home.'

She had started to feel really uncomfortable when on her lunch break, so popped to the loo
