Sitting at the kitchen table, a pensive look on her face, I could tell my 11-year-old granddaughter Delilah had something on her mind.

'Don't you like Grandpa Nev?' she asked of my ex-husband, Neville.

'Yes, I do like him,' I replied.

'Then why are you divorced?'

'We like each other,' I tried to explain, 'but we just don't like living together.'

As Delilah tried to absorb this, with a puzzled look on her face, I felt a great sadness that two of her loving, doting grandparents couldn't be the traditional granny and grandpa she would clearly love to have.

'My ex and I love the grandchildren equally, but being divorced grandparents means everything has to be done separately'

The fact is, I am a prime example of that discomforting modern phenomenon: the divorced grandparent.

Unlike the grandparents of old, my ex-husband Neville and I don't have a cosy, easy family home for our grandchildren.

We can't offer what they would probably like: a safe, shared refuge, with deep old sofas for them to sink into and memories stretching back into our own childhoods.

We cannot give them the experience of two people who have grown old together, who have tolerated each other's funny little ways, and who speak of each other with, mostly, affection.

Now that our five grandchildren are growing up - the eldest is 13 - it seems a tragic loss for them that they have to visit us separately in homes that are far from child-friendly. It also means, sadly, that they are forced to come to terms with divorce at an early age. 

When my husband Neville and I split up in 1988, grandchildren were not even the merest speck on the horizon.

It eventually became apparent that we could not co-exist under the same roof, so the divorce at least brought our bloodcurdling rows to an end. And once divorced, we got on fine.

Our two sons, Tom and Will, teenagers at the time, seem to have lived their lives unaffected by it all. Our grandchildren though - still lovely, fresh-faced, innocent young people - are another matter. 

My ex and I love the grandchildren equally, but being divorced grandparents means everything has to be done separately.

Once, just once since they were born, we managed to take Will's two children to Cotswold Wildlife Park together - after months of planning and co-ordination.

The kids absolutely loved being with both their grandparents, and we had enormous fun, too. Joint grandparenting is so much more enjoyable than when you take them out alone. It's jollier, more varied and less lonely for the adult.

You can relive the event afterwards, together - in fact, my ex and I always talk about that wonderful day out on the occasions that we do speak. But it was never to be repeated.

If I want to have my grandchildren to stay, I do so by myself.

If Neville wants to take them to the seaside while they are with me, I drive them to the station to meet him, drop them off, then pick them up later, which is strange and unsettling for them.

The reasons for this are both historical and logistical.

By the time the grandchildren were born, Neville and I were living in different parts of the country, and could not easily get together anyway. I was also in another relationship and Neville remained resolutely single.

Now that my partner, John, has died, I know my grandchildren would secretly like Neville and me to be a nice elderly couple like their other grandparents.

But even though my ex and I remain good friends, too much time has passed for this.

It all means that we miss out on many milestones.

I don't think we have ever celebrated a grandchild's birthday together - we've been separated for so long that it would feel unnatural to be together at a family gathering.

Our sons have got used to scheduling us in separately.

We're fine when it's just the two of us, but when the family are present, old slights, hurts and arguments come to the surface, reminding us why we separated. Christmases are another difficult time.

My sons always stay with their in-laws rather than descending on me, a lone grandparent living in an upstairs flat.

I feel envious of Tom, who every year goes to a big house, where his mother-in-law organises picture-perfect family get-togethers.  Would I like to join in? Yes - I feel extremely left out.

It would never even occur to either of my sons to come and stay with me or my ex - the atmosphere would never be the same - so I have never witnessed my grandchildren's excited faces as they open their presents. They tell me about the games played, the walks with the cousins and the way they all reconnect.

'We're fine when it's just the two of us, but when the family are present, old slights, hurts and arguments come to the surface, reminding us why we separated'

It would be a deprivation for the families to come to me - even if there was room for them all - so I have to be pleased that at least their other grandparents can give them a fantastic Christmas.  

It is all a stark contrast to the wonderful, simple relationship my sons and I used to have with my own grandparents. I was happy and relaxed in their home and always look back on them with love and gratitude.

I saw my grandparents most days and loved to 'help' my grandfather on his allotment. He would choose the smallest carrots and new potatoes for me and pick the sweetest peas.

I chatted to him about World War I and to my gran about going into service at 12 years old. They never seemed to argue.  

At least, I tell myself, neither of us has remarried, so there is not a step-grandparent for them to get used to - the situation that faces Prince George as he grows up. 

When my own grandchildren were born, I felt an overwhelming and completely unexpected outpouring of love for them.

I am quite indifferent to all non-related babies, however cute they may be - they are not the flesh of my flesh and therefore there is no bond, no attachment.

So I could not expect my partner, John, who was still alive when four of my grandchildren were born, to feel the same emotional tug.

When you have a non-related partner, you can't do that delicious grandparently thing of cooing over the new baby together to see the family resemblances.

Nor will you have the same interest in poring over endless pictures of them, or laughing at their amusing little sayings.

'It's true that I may be a fun, modern, up-to-date granny with the latest computer - but I can never welcome them into the family home where their own parents grew up'

In the Royal Family, there have been rumours that Charles gets impatient with Camilla's existing five grandchildren - no wonder; he's not their real grandfather.

My grandchildren far prefer to stay with their other grandparents than with me or my ex.

They are solid, traditional elderly couples who are still married and who have lived in the same house for decades.

My heart sinks when Will tells me they are going to Cornwall, where his wife's parents live, as he does several times a year - it hurts to know the other grandparents have a much closer relationship with the children than I do.

His mother-in-law is a wonderful old-fashioned granny, who loves to bake special cakes when she knows they are coming.

Tom's in-laws have lived in the same beautiful house for more than 40 years, and the grandchildren love to explore it.

Such grandparents, devoted to each other for life, are an increasingly rare breed, probably soon to be replaced by one biological grandparent and a step.

And instead of remaining in family homes, the grandparents of tomorrow will move into smart new flats where they don't like to cook in case it messes up the designer kitchen.

It's true that I may be a fun, modern, up-to-date granny with the latest computer, 3D TV and surround sound, and I can give them all sorts of treats.

But I can never welcome them into the family home where their own parents grew up. And it saddens me beyond measure that this is the case.
