A burglar who was jailed for 
three-and-a-half years threatened his victims from behind bars - with a 
Facebook warning that 'your time is coming'.

While serving time at HMP Dartmoor, Lee Fitchett wrote, with appalling grammar: 'won't 4get those 3
 f*** heads who put me in prison 4 3y 6m but my day is coming and so is 
theres and they won't see it coming'.

The 29-year-old, was imprisoned in August 2010, after being found guilty of raiding a friend’s house on Christmas Eve.

Ten people clicked 'like' under the comment, and his friend Shaun Hill wrote: 'I don't just like this!, I ****ing love it!'.

In Novemeber 2011 Fitchett was moved 
to an open prison, but he escaped from there to because he felt 
'oppressed by the conversation of paedophiles and the prevalence of 
drugs' and wanted to move to a more secure jail.

During the Christmas Eve burglary 
Fitchett had rifled through possessions in a child’s bedroom before 
stealing jewellery worth £1,000.

The thug also posted a picture of 
himself on Facebook with his arms folded in a tough pose - writing ‘no 
mercy, only God can judge me’.

The message taunting his victims was removed last week after the social networking site was contacted by the Ministry of Justice.

Fitchett served his time at HMP Dartmoor in Devon before he was transferred to Leyhill open prison, Gloucestershire, in November 2011, ahead of his expected release.

His Facebook posts were written before he was transferred from HMP Dartmoor.

Days after his transfer he escaped from jail so that he would get sent to a more secure jail, which he would have preferred.

After dropping in on his girlfriend, he handed himself in to Swindon police station 48 hours later.

He even left his key in the cell door so the authorities wouldn’t have to go to the cost of changing the locks.

He was ordered to serve an extra eight months in jail - but it was cut on appeal to an extra 28 days.Fitchett was released from the open prison last month.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'There was an offensive comment on the page and in this case we passed the matter on to Facebook, who removed the post in line with their policies.'
