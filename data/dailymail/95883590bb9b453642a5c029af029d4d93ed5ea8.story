This is the five-year-old girl who died along with her grandfather when she was swept out to sea by a freak wave.

Lara Lewis, described as a ‘magical’ and ‘charming little lass’, was playing with seashells when she was engulfed by a 10ft wave on a Portuguese beach.

Her grandfather Brian O’Dwyer, 66, and his wife Jill, who live in Portugal, tried to rescue her but Mr O’Dwyer drowned.

Mrs O’Dwyer, pulled from the water by fishermen, was ‘screaming and crying’ as she saw lifeguards trying in vain to revive her granddaughter and husband. She has since been discharged from hospital after being treated for shock.

Lara’s devastated parents, Philip Lewis, 46, a professor at University College London, and his wife Sian, 36, were sunbathing on the beach nearby, but were unable to reach them in time.

The accident happened shortly before 2pm on Tuesday.

Yesterday Lara’s paternal grandmother Sara Lewis, 72, told how her son called her later that day to break the news.

‘He could hardly speak,’ she said. ‘I knew something terrible had happened by the sound of his voice. He almost couldn’t bring himself to tell me and I couldn’t make it all out, but I knew I didn’t want him to repeat it.

‘He was talking about a wave, and how it had overcome Lara. He told me she had drowned along with her grandfather.

‘Brian, who was a wonderful and brave man, tried to rescue her. He swam out so that he could save Lara, but they both couldn’t make it.’ Mrs Lewis recalled how a few weeks earlier Lara had been ‘laughing and playing’ at her fifth birthday party.

She added: ‘Lara herself was a magical little girl. So full of happiness and life. She was always smiling. It’s a terrible tragedy. The family is just devastated.’

Mr Lewis’s two sons from a previous relationship, Harry, 17, and Dylan, 18, were also heartbroken, she said, adding: ‘How does somebody move on from such a tragedy? I just don’t know. It’s terribly, terribly sad.’

Commander Antonio Albuquerque Silva, head of the maritime police in Nazare, said: ‘The little girl was playing with some shells in the sand, near the sea but not in it, when she was surprised by a very big wave which dragged her out to sea.

‘Her grandparents followed her in an attempt to rescue her but tragically they were unable to do so and the grandfather died in the attempt.

‘It is a very dangerous beach outside of the lifeguard zones.’

Lifeguard Nuno Carreira, 19, said: ‘The waves were very, very powerful and up to ten feet high. We put the red flag up to tell people to stay out of the sea because it was too dangerous.

‘We only cover a small area of the beach, and the grandparents took the little girl for a walk further up the shore. They were about 400 yards outside the area we monitor when the tragedy happened. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but it seems the girl was swept away by a big wave, and the grandparents then tried to save her.

‘My colleague and I ran as fast as we could. When we got there I saw a fisherman on the sands with the little girl in his arms, but she wasn’t breathing and was very pale.

‘I started doing first aid, trying to restart her heart. My colleague dived into the sea and pulled the grandad out but he was also not breathing either.’

Mr Carreira said he then saw Mrs O’Dwyer in the sea and he pulled her to shore. ‘She was crying and screaming for her husband and granddaughter,’ he said. ‘It was very, very sad. We did our best to save all three of them but only managed to save one.’

The tragedy happened at Salgado, a spectacular four-mile white beach, near Nazare, a former fishing village 80 miles north of Lisbon.

The second lifeguard, David Branco, 18, said: ‘We spent more than an hour trying to revive the girl because we just didn’t want to give up.’

An investigation is being carried out by the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a matter of routine.

Lara had just started at Rushmore Primary School near the family’s home in Clapton, North London.

Headmaster Ian Mullaney said: ‘She was a delightful young girl from a lovely family and this has come as a huge shock to the whole Rushmore community.

‘Lara was a bright, friendly and positive girl who was well liked by her teachers and classmates.

'It is a tragedy and the news is just sinking in for all of us.'

Mrs Lewis was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, along with two of her brothers, Corin, 34, and Terence, 33.

Her husband is an expert on the study of the Earth’s surface through electromagnetic radiation.

He has a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Queen Mary College, London; an MSc from Imperial College; and he obtained his Doctorate at University College in 1996. He has been based at UCL for 24 years.

Friends and colleagues of Prof Lewis spoke of their sadness yesterday after learning that his daughter and father-in-law had drowned.

One of his colleagues in the Department 
of Geography at University College London, said : 'I had no idea his 
daughter was the little girl involved in this tragedy.

'Everyone here will be totally shocked. My heart goes out to him and his family at this sad time.'

Professor Jon French, head of the department, said in a statement: 'All of us at UCL are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic drowning, in Portugal, of Lara Lewis, daughter of Philip Lewis, professor of remote sensing in the Department of Geography.

'The loss of Lara and of her grandfather, who was also drowned in this same incident, is a truly heartbreaking tragedy and our deepest condolences go to Professor Lewis and his family.'

Neighbour David Mason, a translator, said he had known Lara since she was a baby and described her as 'absolutely charming'.

The 69-year-old said: 'I remember them bringing her home in her dad's arms and they were such a happy family.

'I used to see her come out of the house with her mother and she was always cheerful and would always say to me, "Hello, Dave". She was very friendly.

'This is terribly sad news and for a lot of people it's still sinking in.

'They were well known across the community and a lot of people are very upset by the news.'

Holiday: The children had been holidaying in Portugal with their parents who were sunbathing elsewhere at Salgado beach when the tragedy unfolded

He added: 'You expect young children to be almost invulnerable. She was so full of life.

'People will react in different ways. We just all wish it hadn't happened.

'We will all have to work out how to deal with it but anything they want or need as a family, we will do for them.'

A neighbour who lives opposite the family and gave his name only as Tony, said: 'She was a smashing little girl. She always looked happy walking with her mum.

'It's dreadful what's happened. Everybody on the street is shocked by it.'

He added: 'I haven't spoken to the family yet so don't want to say anything else right now. I want to respect their wishes.'

In pieces: Neighbours described the family as 'lovely' and 'happy'

Another neighbour said: 'They are a lovely family. She was a lovely child and will be sorely missed within the whole community.

'We are a very close-knit community around here and everyone knows everyone else’s children. It’s going to be really hard.'

He paid tribute to Lara’s grandfather as a 'lovely man,' adding: 'Everyone will be very sad.'

Pictures of the scene showed 
firefighters crouching down in the sand in the afternoon sunshine, about
 to move the victims, and the rest of the family collapsing in each other's arms.

Mr O'Dwyer's body was covered in a blue 
sheet.

One report said the 66-year-old drowned trying to save his granddaughter’s life.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office 
said: ‘We are aware of reports of the deaths of two British nationals in
 Portugal and are in touch with the local authorities.’

Salgado
 beach, which stretches over 3.5 miles, is popular with surfers and body
 boarders attracted by the rolling Atlantic breakers, but its tides are 
known locally to be dangerous and swimmers are warned to take great 
care.
