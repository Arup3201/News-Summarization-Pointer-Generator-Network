It would be the ultimate coup for any charity to get Simon Cowell, Gordon Ramsey, Taylor Swift, Gok Wan and Debbie Harry to appear at a fundraising event.

But a closer look reveals that things aren't quite as they seem.

The group of 'stars' are actually professional lookalikes who earn thousands of pounds every week by appearing at events as doppelgangers of real life celebrities.

On this occasion they waived their fees to make an appearance as charity fundraiser in Nottingham to raise money to help fight breast cancer.

Double take: Simon Cowell and Blondie share an intimate moment as the lookalikes are in fact a couple in real life

'Uncanny': From a distance you could almost believe you were looking at a particularly odd mix of celebrities

Who would ever ever believe that that was Taylor Swift... like ever?

The event, held at a Greek restaurant in Nottingham, was organised after Debbie Harry lookalike Rose lost her mother to cancer earlier this year..

Diners were said to be 'stunned' when celebrity 
chef Gordon Ramsay gave Simon Cowell a grilling before chatting up pop princess Taylor Swift.

Cowell lookalike Andy Monk, 54, and 
Gordon Ramsay double Martin Jordan, 42, a factory worker from Kent, fooled onlookers as they rowed in the middle of the restaurant.

Customers were even more stunned when they spotted the X Factor chief with Taylor Swift doppelganger Xenna Kristian, 18.

Other lookalikes who joined in the fun included an Engelbert Humperdinck, a Gok Wan and a 'dead ringer' for pop veteran Sir Cliff Richards.

Stellar: It would certainly be a big coup for any charity if they managed to get such a wide range of stars to turn up to a single event

But the real shock came when Cowell ended 
the evening by smooching Blondie singer Debbie Harry - who is in fact 
his fiancee Rose Cook, 43, from Derby.

One shocked customer said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw Gordon Ramsay effing and blinding at Simon Cowell.

'Simon then walked over to the bar area and was having a cosy chat with Taylor Swift - it was like being in the middle of a top celebrity party.

'It was astonishing and everyone in the restaurant gasped until the 'stars' all fell about laughing and explained they were lookalikes. They were very convincing.

'It still looked weird to see Simon 
Cowell having a snog with Blondie though, some people took pictures on 
their mobile phones even though they knew they were lookalikes.'

lookalike Andy Monk said: 'It was a great evening and it is always fun 
to see people's reactions when they see us all dressed as the 
celebrities we imitate.'

Convinced? Dinners were reportedly shocked when Simon Cowell and Gordon Ramsay started to have an argument at the event
