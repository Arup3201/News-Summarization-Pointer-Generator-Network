For any Italians that harboured ambitions as a child of one day pulling on the famous red strip of Leyton Orient, the dream could be edging closer to reality.

The east London club is the subject of a TV show on the continent in which footballers compete against one another to win a professional contract at Brisbane Road.

The Leyton Orient Show follows the players as they train at the club's training ground and play in trial games at the stadium.

The reality show airs on prime time Italian TV on Thursday nights and was the idea of club owner Francesco Becchetti, who also owns the Agon Channel that the programme appears on.

'It's a great success, especially for the amount of people that are watching Leyton Orient,' Becchetti told BBC News.

'People are talking about Leyton Orient. People are talking about this talent show and the opportunity we are giving young Italians to come to London to live this great experience, with regards to both the city and British football.'

Italian businessman Becchetti acquired Leyton Orient last summer and had grand plans for the League One club with former owner Barry Hearn declaring that Premier League neighbours West Ham 'should be petrified' of the Italian.

Becchetti took ownership of the club after they missed out on promotion to Championship by the narrowest of margins following a penalty shootout defeat by Rotherham in the play-off final.

Fast-forward nine months and Orient are rock bottom of the third tier but Becchetti does not agree that the reality TV has been a distraction to their campaign.

'I think that it is wrong to think that if they (Leyton Orient) are bottom of the league now there is something wrong with it. The reason they are doing not so well is because we are starting a new era and I think that with all the investment, when you start something new, you have to wait a little bit of time.

But with the club fighting relegation supporters are less convinced about the merits of the show.

Tom Davies from the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust said: 'As the results have gotten worse I think it is something that people have latched on to as something that sums up where we're going wrong really. People are using the word circus and saying this is a joke club.'
