Eight police officers were hurt and 18 protesters arrested in Seattle on Wednesday when a May Day rally that began peacefully turned violent after dark, with crowds hurling rocks and bottles at police who responded with pepper spray grenades.

Protesters threw rocks, bottles and chunks of asphalt at officers, officials said, smashing store and car windows, overturning trash cans and lining up newspaper display racks to block streets.

Police in riot gear, some riding in armored SWAT vehicles, responded by repeatedly firing 'blast ball' grenades, which emit smoke tinged with pepper spray.

'We're a bigger, better city than this,' Mayor Mike McGinn said at a news conference. 'I'm disappointed that this is the picture the world sees of us.'

Most of the 150-200 protesters who had
 stayed on the street after darkness fell for a 'non-permitted' protest 
had dispersed by midnight.

'We did not start to take action until
 that group itself started to act violently towards the officers and the
 community at large,' Assistant Police Chief Paul McDonagh said.

Several dozen protesters, many using 
bandanas to cover their faces, began clashing with police in downtown 
Seattle hours after a peaceful immigrant-rights march ended.

Protesters
 threw rocks and bottles at police officers and news crews. As they 
moved through downtown Seattle to another neighborhood, they flung 
construction street barriers, trash cans and newspaper bins on the 
streets in an attempt to stop police officers.

One protester was seen using a skateboard to smash windows at a Walgreens drug store in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and others overturned trash cans and lined up newspaper display racks to block police.

Windows of businesses were broken and vehicles with people in them were banged around.

Police used their bikes to shield businesses and eventually began to use pepper spray and 'flash bang' grenades - releasing a flash of light, smoke and a loud noise - to disperse the crowd. But that pushed the group to another nearby neighborhood, and they left a wake of overturned trash cans and debris on the street.

Officers in riot gear, some riding in armored SWAT vehicles, repeatedly fired the grenades and tried to disperse the crowd.

Seattle police department said that one officer was injured after being hit by an object.

Initially, the protesters concentrated on a business sector of downtown Seattle. 

This is the second year in a row violence has broken out during May Day in Seattle. Last year, anarchists broke windows of store fronts, including Niketown, and vehicles and used smoke bombs. Protesters also targeted a federal building, breaking windows and doors.

The violence broke out as darkness fell in Seattle following a day of May Day rallies in cities across the U.S. West that were planned by a coalition of organized labor activists, students, civil rights advocates and members of the clergy to call for an overhaul of immigration laws.

Olivia One Feather of Covington 
joined the crowd Wednesday night because she wanted to see how police 
handled the protest. She said she wasn't impressed, adding that she was 
pepper sprayed in the face while trying to video record officers.

'They don't have any manners. They don't say please or give you time to get out of the way,' she said.

Of
 the protesters, she added, 'They're doing what we need to do to stand 
up to ourselves. These are our streets and we have the right to take 
them.'

Many of the 
protesters are self-described anarchists. A local anarchist website said
 protesters would attempt to disrupt the day.

The violence marred a May Day that immigrant-rights activists hoped would put a focus back on immigration reform. 

Thousands
 of people marched about 2 1/2 miles from the Central District toward 
Seattle's downtown Jackson Federal Building after a May Day rally 
supporting immigrant rights and labor.

Many
 carried signs, with messages such as 'We are America,' and 'There are 
no illegal humans.' One sign suggested forgetting about marijuana and 
instead asking the United States to 'Legalize my mom,' a reference to 
Washington's recent legalization of marijuana.

Other
 demonstrations and rallies in Olympia, Mount Vernon, Spokane, 
Vancouver, Walla Walla, Wenatchee and Yakima went along peacefully.

In
 Los Angeles, thousands of protesters marched through downtown Los 
Angeles waving American flags and carrying signs with the slogan, 'Stop 
deportations.'

The 
demonstrators chanted in Spanish, 'Obama! Escucha! Estamos en la lucha!'
 ('Obama! Listen! We are in the fight!'), as they marched under sunny 
skies down one of downtown's main thoroughfares.

The march spanned across more than two large city blocks, and one police officer told Reuters that unofficial estimates put the size of the crowd at roughly 3,500 people. No arrests were reported.

In Arizona, where a state crackdown against illegal immigration was signed into law three years ago, several hundred people joined a late-afternoon rally outside the state Capitol in Phoenix, ahead of a march through downtown.

The protests come about two weeks after a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced an 844-page bill, backed by President Barack Obama, that would rewrite many of America's immigration laws.

A centerpiece of the measure would create a path to legal status and ultimately citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

It also aims to secure the U.S. border with Mexico against illegal entry and to make it easier for industry, particularly high-tech businesses and agriculture, to hire workers from abroad when needed.
