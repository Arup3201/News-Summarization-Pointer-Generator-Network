Anthony Mason, who carved out a reputation for rugged defense over 13 seasons in the NBA, including 5 on the Ewing-era New York Knicks, is dead at 48.

The Knicks organization confirmed Mason's death, which the New York Daily News reported happened early Saturday morning after a struggle with heart problems.

'We would like to thank everyone for their heartfelt thoughts and strong prayers. Anthony felt each and every one. He fought like a warrior to the very end,' the Mason family said in a statement.

Warrior: Anthony Mason linked up with Charles Oakley on the New York Knicks, providing a defensive mindedness that help the team be a physical presence in the 90s

Mason won a Sixth Man Award with the Knicks and later made the 2001 All-Star team while playing with the Miami Heat.

It was the toughness he provided alongside Charles Oakley while surrounding franchise center Patrick Ewing that made him beloved in New York.

'MY MAN MY MAN A. MASON R.I.P, WE GONNA MISS U BROTHER,' Oakley wrote on Twitter.

The 6-foot-7 Mason won the NBA's Sixth Man award in 1995 with a Knicks team that was eliminated in the second round of the playoffs in one of its classic clashes with the Indiana Pacers. 

Mason also won all-defensive-team honors two years later with the Charlotte Hornets.

Mason struggled with heart problems in recent years and never fully recovered after a massive heart attack on February 11.

'Overnight New York City and the world lost a legend, a friend, a brother... but more than anything our father, Anthony Mason,' said his son Anthony Jr, according to the New York Daily News.

Knicks President Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls teams against the '90s Knicks, said that 'as a competitor, there was none fiercer than Anthony Mason.'

'Standing on the opposite end of the playing field, coaching in those great Chicago/New York battles, No. 14 in the orange and blue always stood out,' Jackson added.

Mason's career averages - 10.9 points, 8.3 rebounds - don't tell the full story of his game. A solid, muscular presence down low, Mason was there to play defense, and on coach Pat Riley's bruising teams, he could shine.

All Star: While playing with the Heat in 2001, Mason was selected for the All Star Game as a replacement

Mason played for New York from 1991-1996, and then for the Hornets until 2000. He made his only All-Star team in 2001 as a member of the Miami Heat, after reuniting with Riley.

'Anthony Mason exemplified perseverance for all players fighting for their chance in the NBA,' Commissioner Adam Silver said.

'NBA fans and players around the league admired his tenacity on defense and playmaking on offense.'

He wasn't all grit, though. Despite his plodding look, Mason was a nimble athlete and deft ballhandler who often showed up for games with words or designs styled into his hair.

Mason was drafted in the third round out of Tennessee State in 1988 by Portland, but he never played for the Trail Blazers. 

After a brief stint overseas, he played sparingly in 21 games for the New Jersey Nets and Denver Nuggets before he finally caught on with Riley's defense-first Knicks in 1991.

He was a force for them as they made a run to the 1994 NBA Finals, and clashed with other powerful Eastern Conference teams, including Michael Jordan's Bulls.

He was dealt to Charlotte in a July 1996 trade that brought Larry Johnson to New York. W

ith the Hornets, Mason played three strong seasons in four years, missing 1998-99 due to injury, before Riley brought him to Miami, where he was coaching a Heat team that played with the same style as those Knicks teams with which Mason flourished.

At Tennessee State, Mason was dominant, and was the school's first All-Ohio Valley Conference selection. In the 1987-88 season, he took a school-record 247 free throws.

Anthony Mason was born Dec 14, 1966, in Miami. He went to high school in the New York City borough of Queens, where his son Anthony Jr would later play for St John's University before going on to a pro career in the minor leagues and overseas. 

Another son, Antoine, is at Auburn this season after transferring from Niagara, where he graduated after finishing second nationally with 25.6 points per game last season.
