It's one of the world's best-loved stories - how Captain Georg von Trapp, his ex-nun wife Maria and their large brood of children sing their way out of bankruptcy and escaped Nazi-occupied Austria, where the hills are alive with the sound of music, to start a new life in America.

The family's story is basically true and was turned into an Oscar-winning film with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews in the leading roles, although the facts were considerably stretched by Hollywood.

Three generations later, and some 60 years since the original von Trapps last sang together, four of the Captain and Maria's great-grandchildren - Sofi, 25, Melanie, 23, Amanda, 22 and their 19-year-old brother August - have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together.

The von Trapp descendents  Sofi, August, Amanda and Melanie von Trapp, have come together to sing once more

Their grandfather was Werner, born in 1915, and renamed as Kurt in The Sound Of Music movie. Werner's parents were Captain von Trapp and his first wife Agathe, who died of scarlet fever in 1922, leaving her seven children motherless.

I meet the young von Trapps in Portland, Oregon, where they now live after their father had settled in Montana. They've been singing together for 13 years, and I ask if they feel it was destined that this was what they would do?

Amanda says, 'I don't think so. We were just children having fun, with no sense of destiny.' Explains Melanie, 'Grandfather Werner was a very quiet man, and didn't tell many stories. He died in 2007, but long after he retired he'd come to our house to teach us Austrian yodelling songs and that inspired our love of music. But there was no pressure on us to carry on the family tradition.'

'When we told our parents what we wanted to do they were surprised. They said, "Really, you want to start singing?"' says Sofi. 'We all loved it so much and we all loved being together.' August adds, 'We can definitely get tired of each other but because we have the same goal we want to make this work. We decided a long time ago if we just learn to get along we can do fun things.'

August, who seems older than his 19 years, wrote some of the songs on Dream A Little Dream, the album they've just made with the band Pink Martini. 'We don't plan to sing together for the rest of our lives,' says Amanda. 'For us it's just a fun experience,' adds Sofi, 'but for our great-grandparents it was a means of survival.'  

Sofi, August, Amanda and Melanie's direct descendents inspired one of the best loved films of all time

After his wife Agathe's death, Captain von Trapp employed Maria Kutschera, a novice nun, as a tutor for his daughter, also called Maria, because she was ill. In the film version, little Maria's name is changed to Louisa, and the older woman is the family governess.

She and Georg eventually married in 1927 (not 1938 as in the film), and had three more children. When von Trapp lost most of his fortune in a bank crash, Maria turned the family hobby - singing - into a career and they performed to great acclaim all over Europe. 

In March 1938, when the Nazis marched into Salzburg, pressure was put on Georg, a World War I naval hero, to command a ship under Hitler. But he refused, and the von Trapps decided to leave Austria. Maria arranged a concert tour in America, where they planned to start a new life. But unlike the film's version, they did not need to climb any mountains to escape.

Maria von Trapp, daughter of Austrian Baron Georg von Trapp, was the last surviving von Trapp singer. She died earlier this year

According to the movie, the family give their guards the slip after a show. They're discovered hiding by a young Nazi who threatens to shoot the Captain, but he disarms the boy. The von Trapps make their escape in a waiting car. The Nazis try to make chase but their cars have been sabotaged by nuns. The family then hike over the Alps to Switzerland and freedom.

In fact there was no Nazi boy, no chase. The family left by train (the local station was directly behind their house) and made their way to Italy and then to America via London, where they soon emulated their European singing success.

Sofi says, 'They came to America and sang for many years to make a living. Our grandfather Werner was about 40 when he finally stopped in 1955. They had no expectations that any of their descendants would start singing. It was a real surprise to the rest of the family when we did.'

Maria wrote a book about the von Trapp Family which found its way to Broadway, and then she sold the rights for £3,000 to Hollywood to make The Sound Of Music movie. 'I never met my great-grandmother Maria,' says Sofi.

'She died in 1987, a year before I was born. We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group. The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.'

The real Maria could never have foreseen the impact the film would have, and made it clear she did not approve of the exaggerations. Christopher Plummer portrayed the Captain as brusque and harsh with his children.

'Our great-aunt Agathe (renamed Liesl in the film) said he wasn't like that,' says Amanda. 'He really did love his children and was fun to be with. Apparently he packed a really good snowball and played with the kids a lot. But he did blow a whistle to summon them.

'The butler, who was a Nazi although his first loyalty was to the family, warned our great-grandfather that they were planning on taking him off to a camp,' Amanda continues. 'They packed up little bags and pretended they were going on a picnic so neighbours wouldn't be suspicious. The house they lived in was later occupied by the Nazis. Afterwards, they got it back but Maria gave it to a religious order and it became a convent.

'Now it's a hotel. Maria never turned her back on her religion. She did missionary trips and remained devout and never had much money.' After touring America, their great-grandparents bought land in Vermont. 'They built a music camp and a skiing camp, which are run now by our Uncle Johan,' says Sofi.

The Sound Of Music has touched millions of people's hearts. Just say 'Doe, a deer…' and you're flushed with nostalgia and tunes you can sing in your sleep. When they first watched it, were the young von Trapps aware that the little boy playing Kurt was portraying their grandfather?

'Our parents told us, "That's your grandfather,"' says Sofi. 'But the film had been recorded on two tapes and we lost the second one. The first one ended where Maria flees the house (confused about her feelings after dancing with her employer, the Captain). We didn't know what happened next.'

They are proud of their legacy, though. Melanie says, 'Our great-grandfather stood up to the Nazis and said, "No, I won't be part of what you're trying to do." That's what meant so much to us and it did make us feel there was a message we were carrying on.'

The last surviving von Trapp singer Maria (stepdaughter of the Maria played by Julie Andrews) died earlier this year. 'We were close to her,' says Sofi.

'For us it's fun, for them it was a means of survival'

'She would visit us and she was the most cheerful great-aunt. She was always laughing and had this twinkle in her eye. She would carry her accordion and sing beautiful Austrian folk songs, and she taught us Austrian folk dancing. Maria was the last of that generation who remembered all the old stories.

'She told us the Captain was completely heartbroken when his first wife passed away. They all sang. They went on camping trips and would play instruments, but it was their stepmother Maria who taught them how to harmonise.'

Amanda says of their great-aunt Maria, 'She'd always wear a braid of hair over her head, an incredible hairdo. She had a good sense of humour too.' Sofi adds, 'She would come to our shows and when August took a bow at the end she would say, "I am glad that your hair didn't fall off because it looks like a little roof of straw." He was so blond.'

The four siblings met the band leader of Pink Martini at a Christmas tree lighting event and they began working together. He had some original von Trapp Family records in his collection, and suggested they do In Stiller Nacht (In The Quiet Night), a Brahms lullaby that to the surprise of the youngsters had been a hit for their great-grandparents.

'We had no idea,' says Sofi.

The album includes a couple of August's compositions and some Sound Of Music classics - among them Edelweiss, which they sing with Charmian Carr, who played Liesl, their great-aunt Agathe, in the film.

They met her in 2010 when they were invited onto The Oprah Winfrey Show to meet the cast who played the family in the film. Julie Andrews was queen-like, they say.

They all seem to have wisdom and naivety in equal parts. They've travelled the world and seen a lot, but at the same time seen nothing at all. It's as if they're channelling another age. Their songs could easily have been sung in the 1930s and they would still bring the hills alive with the sound of music.

Dream A Little Dream is out on 5 May.
