Manchester City have inquired about signing Anderlecht’s Dennis Praet.

Manuel Pellegrini has said that UEFA Financial Fair Play restrictions will make it difficult for the club to sign players this month, but despite this City are closely monitoring Praet.

The £10million attacking midfielder was excellent in Anderlecht’s Champions League games against Arsenal, and City have been watching him for some time.

Praet could make the move to the Etihad Stadium and then be immediately loaned back to Anderlecht

City not only have a restriction on the amount they can spend but they have also agreed to limit their wage bill and are short of homegrown players for their Champions League squad.

Even if a deal is done this month, there is a possibility that Praet, whose contract runs out in 2017, could stay at Anderlecht for another season.

This which would keep him off the City wage bill and allow him to mature in the process.

But City will have to conclude a deal quickly as Borussia Dortmund are also keen on the midfielder, who once trialled at Arsenal, and could put him straight into their team.
