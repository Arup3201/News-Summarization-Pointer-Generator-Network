Spike Lee has blasted a New York Times film critic who claimed his recent criticism of gentrification in Brooklyn was hypocritical because he lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

The filmmaker delivered an expletive-filled lecture at Pratt Institute for Black History Month in February about white 'hipsters' acting like Christopher Columbus and 'kill(ing) off the Native Americans' in the borough.

Commenting on the 7 minute rant, A.O. Scott wrote in Sunday's Times: 'As is often the case with Mr. Lee's public utterances, this one was a mixture of hyperbole, provocation and plain truth... What's the saying about people who live in glass brownstones?'

But the article incensed Lee so much that he penned an open letter Monday to the critic defending his Brooklyn credentials and his ability to comment on the changing face of the borough despite moving away.

Angry: Spike Lee, pictured, has blasted a New York Times film critic who claimed his recent criticism of gentrification in Brooklyn was hypocritical because he lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side

'Your criticism of me as a hypocrite is lame, weak and not really thought out,' he vented on social media website WhoSay.

'You stated in your Article that because I live in The Upper East Side and I'm talking about Gentrification that makes me Hypocrite. The fact is where I live has nothing to do with it. Your argument is OKEY DOKE.'

He went on: 'The Truth is The Truth. The
 Truth is The Light... The Truth is Gentrification is Great for the New 
Arrivals in Harlem, South Bronx, Bushwick, Red Hook, Bed-Stuy Do or Die 
and Fort Greene, and in many other cities across the U.S.

But not so great for The Brown and Black Residents who have been in these Neighborhoods for decades and are being forced out, to the Suburbs, Down South or back to their Native Islands.'

Outlining his Brooklyn background, he explains that his family moved from his native Atlanta to settle in Crown Heights when he was 3.

He said his parents bought their first home in 1968 in Fort Greene, where his Father still lives.

'Mr. Scott, what you fail to understand is that I can live on The Moon and what I said is still TRUE. No matter where I choose to live that has nothing to do with it. I will always carry Brooklyn in my Blood, Heart and Soul.'

Comparing himself to rapper Jay-Z, who has Brooklyn roots but now resides in Tribeca, Lee wrote: 'Did anyone call Jay-Z a Hypocrite when he helped with bringing The Nets from New Jersey to The Barclays Center in Brooklyn at the Corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenue?

'Hey Buddy, Jay-Z had been long, long gone from The Marcy Projects and Brooklyn a long, long, long time ago and more Power to my BK ALL DAY Brother. Should Jay-Z no longer mention Brooklyn in his Songs because he no longer resides there?'

He then ranted about all the movies he's made and that, by Scott's logic, he shouldn't have written and directed the films because he didn't live in the neighborhoods where they were set.

In a final assault, he concluded the letter by listing many Brooklyn natives who still hold the borough dear despite living elsewhere now.

'It doesn't matter where you choose to live because Brooklyn goes where you go,' he wrote.

'It still lives inside Larry King, Sandy Koufax, Big Daddy Kane, Bernard and Albert King, Barry Manilow, Stephon Marbury, Rhea Perlman, Adam Sandler, Neil Sedaka (and) Jerry Seinfeld,' and the list went on before signing off from 'Da Republic of Brooklyn, New York.'
