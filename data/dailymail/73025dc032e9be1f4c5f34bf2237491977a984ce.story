The reality of jet-powered travel grows ever closer - and now a Colorado-based company has demonstrated its small jet-pack inside a large government building packed with spectators.

The ‘Go Fast Jet Pack’ has a maximum speed of 77mph (124km/h) and can reach heights of 250ft (76 metres).

And unlike other jet-packs, this one is small
 and does not need a large frame, wings or a pressurised jets of water 
to allow pilots to fly.

We have lift off! A pilot wearing a small jet-pack (pictured) has wowed an audience inside a inside a large glass building when he performed a speedy fly-past. The 'Go Fast Jet Pack' has a maximum speed of 77mph (124km/h) and can reach heights of 250ft (76metres)

It is fuelled by a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen.

The nitrogen provides a ‘push’ for the hydrogen peroxide through the motor, which converts it to high temperature and high pressure steam inside rocket nozzles that allows the machine to fly.

The jet-pack provides 300lbs of thrust or 800 horsepower for 33 seconds, but in the future, pilots may be able to embark upon longer trips using the technology.

Currently they can only cover distance of up to 2,500ft (760metres).

The 'Go Fast Jet Pack' may not be a sleek as Iron Man's (pictured) but it allows people to fly after 100 hours of lessons, much like the fictional super hero.

While the fuel is non-explosive and non-flammable, the jet-pack still dangerous compared to other modes of transport and requires at least 100 hours of training to operate it. The vehicle is currently not available commercially.

The demonstration of the jet-pack, which its makers claim is a ‘green eco-friendly machine,’ took place in Washington at Smithsonian Magazine's Future is Here festival which was hosted at the Ronald Reagan Building and International trade Center.

It was driven by performance pilot Nick Macomber, who works for the firm behind the technology.

Jet PI built the machine based upon an old model developed built by Bell Systems in the 1960s, but made it lighter, faster, long-flying and economical.

It claims to be building the ‘world’s most advanced personal flying machines.

Another jet-pack designed and piloted by Swiss inventor Yves Rossy uses jet engines for propulsion.

Free as a bird: Yves Rossy's amazing jet wing, pictured, blurs the line between a plane and a jetpack and while it cannot take off vertically, it uses jet engines its wings offer stability

While it is easily manoeuvrable, the pack features a cumbersome carbon fibre wing, measuring just over 6.6ft (2.2m) across.

Because of its frame, the Swiss jet-pack also has to be deployed from a helicopter and cannot take off from the ground.

The Martin jet-pack, however, can take off vertically and is possibly the most similar in appearance to the ‘Go Fast’ jet-pack, despite being quite a bit larger.

It relies on twin-ducted fans to generate lift. The petrol-powered jet-pack is less environmentally friendly than Jet PI’s but can travel much further – up to 19miles (30km) on a single tank of fuel.

The Martin model has a top speed of 46mph (74km) and can stay airborne for half an hour.
