Already wealthy from the inheritance left by his comedy legend father, sex offender Adam Barker is celebrating a new windfall.

I hear that Ronnie Barker’s 45-year-old son has sold his London home for £550,000 — more than five times what it cost his father in 2001.

The house, where Adam downloaded 1,675 pornographic images, mostly of young boys, on his computer, rocketed in value while Adam was on the run overseas and later in prison.

Following his 2003 arrest at the property in Ealing, he rented the house, which was bought for around £100,000, to tenants during the eight years after he jumped bail.

Adam has gone to ground since he was released last year, a mere 14 weeks after being given a 12-month sentence for child porn offences. He pleaded guilty to 20 charges.

The court heard that the illegal images on his computer included two at level five, the highest possible category.

‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children,’ said Judge Rosa Dean. ‘This wasn’t a one-off offending.’

Adam, who sold the house in February, has never commented on, apologised for, or attempted to explain his crimes.

As a fugitive, he did not attend the funeral of his father, who died in 2005 aged 76, or collect his share of the £275,000 in cash (the maximum tax-free sum) that Barker left his children. Instead, the money was set aside, to be collected on his return.

But Adam’s biggest windfall came after the death of his mother, Joy, in 2011. Her estate, which included the bulk of Ronnie’s former assets, was valued at £6.5 million.

Along with his actress sister Charlotte, 52, and advertising executive brother, Larry, 54, Adam is heir to a share of the earnings from The Two Ronnies star’s back catalogue.

The three are joint shareholders in a company, Handles For Forks Ltd, named after Ronnie’s most famous sketch, set up to administer those earnings.

Because he is on the sex offenders’ register, Adam must notify police of his full-time address. Companies House documents state his correspondence address as the Cotswolds but he is not believed to live there.
