A U.S. government lawyer has reportedly conceded that tens of thousands of long-missing emails belonging to former IRS official Lois Lerner – messages the Obama administration has claimed were lost in a 2011 computer crash – were safely backed up along with the computer records of every other federal employee, claims conservative group Judicial Watch.

The documents are key to a congressional investigation into a political targeting scheme Lerner allegedly masterminded, which involved singling out conservative nonprofits for especially intrusive scrutiny – based on words in their names like 'tea party' or 'patriots' – when they applied for tax-exempt charitable status.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, whose group is suing the IRS over its failure to provide the records to Congress, said Monday that the revelation came on Friday from an attorney who works in Attorney General Eric Holder's Justice Department.

'All the focus on missing hard drives has been a diversion,' he said. 'The Obama administration has known all along where the email records could be – but dishonestly withheld this information. You can bet we are going to ask the court for immediate assistance in cutting through this massive obstruction of justice.'

An irate Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said Monday that after 15 months of wrangling, the federal government has conceded that all of former IRS official Lois Lerner's emails are backed up somewhere

Lerner, the IRS Director of Exempt Organizations when the so-called 'tea party targeting' scandal developed, retired from government service in 2013 and is receiving her full pension

'The Department of Justice attorney told the Judicial Watch attorney on Friday.' Fitton said during a Monday afternoon Fox News broadcast, 'that it turns out the federal government backs up all computer records in case something terrible happens in Washington and there is a catastrophe, so the government can continue operating.'

The catch, he added, is that the DOJ attorney also claimed 'it would be too hard to go and get Lois Lerner's emails from that backup system.'

The Justice Department is representing the federal government in the lawsuit.

'So everything we've been hearing about scratched hard drives, about missing emails of Lois Lerner, [and] other IRS officials, other officials in the Obama administration,' Fitton told Fox, 'it's all been a pack of malarkey.'

'They could get these records, but they don't want to. And they haven't told anyone about it, frankly, until we were able to get it out of them on Friday.'

'And there's no such thing as Lois Lerner's missing e-mails,' he insisted. 'It's all been a big lie. They've been lying to the courts, to the American people and to Congress.'

IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest have been particularly insistent that Lerner's emails were gone forever.

Koskinen told a congressional panel on June 20 that Lerner's hard drive 'was recycled then destroyed' because 'it was determined that it was dysfunctional and that, with experts, no emails could be retrieved.'

Hours later during a White House briefing, Earnest was asked why two years of Lerner's emails were missing. 

'Well, because there was – the computer crashed,' he responded.

'And what we've seen is a demonstrated effort by this administration and by the IRS to try to cooperate with legitimate questions that have been posed by [Congress] on this.'

The FBI is running a parallel investigation into whether Lerner or anyone else in the Treasury Department broke federal laws by targeting conservative groups for political retribution, or by covering it up when Congress began to subpoena records from the administration.

Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, one of the groups the IRS hamstrung for years, said Monday that the latest revelations are 'part of a continuing pattern of dishonesty and thuggery we've seen from this administration.'

'When the government launches intimidation campaigns against private citizens simply because they may not agree with the government – and then lies about evidence being "lost" – it should outrage all Americans.' 

IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has appeared in several Republican-dominated congressional hearings, insisting that Lerner's emails are gone for good and her faulty hard drive was 'recycled'

'Everything we've been hearing about scratched hard drives, about missing emails ... it's all been a pack of malarkey,' Fitton said Monday

Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan demanded two weeks ago that IRS officials sign sworn statements describing efforts that were made to recover the Lerner emails.

None of the affidavits sent to his court so far has mentioned anything about an all-encompassing backup system where the records might still be awaiting discovery.

'We want to know why they hadn't told the court about this backup system,' Fitton said Monday on Fox.

'If this backup system is working, Lois Lerner's emails are there. There are half a dozen other IRS officials whose emails have supposedly disappeared as well. And we've heard from other agencies, like over in the HHS over Obamacare, emails disappearing there.'

'We've been led to believe that once they disappear they can't be found again,' he said, 'when in fact they back up everything, as most people suspected [and] now the government has confirmed.'

Fitton's group plans to ask Judge Sullivan to rule that the Obama administration has gone out of its way to avoid turning over documents that it knew were readily available.

If the IRS has been withholding evidence from the courts, it's also been withholding it from Congress. 

What about the backups? White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on June 20 that Lerner's computer 'crashed' and claimed the Obama administration had tried to 'cooperate with legitimate questions'

'Judicial Watch will press its concerns on Monday, August 25, before U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola,' Fitton said late Monday in a statement.

Sullivan has appointed Facciola, an expert in the courtroom 'discovery' of electronic records, to manage the back-and-forth between the administration and Fitton's attorneys about missing records.

Some of that wrangling concerns exactly what happened after Lerner reported that her hard drive had malfunctioned.

An IRS information technology official wrote Friday in a sworn statement that while tech experts allegedly sent the device for testing and data recovery, no one thought to examine her government-issued Blackberry to see if copies of her emails could be saved.

There is 'no record of any attempt by any IRS IT employee to recover data from any Blackberry device assigned to Lois Lerner in response to the congressional investigations or this litigation,' the IT expert, Stephen Manning, wrote.
