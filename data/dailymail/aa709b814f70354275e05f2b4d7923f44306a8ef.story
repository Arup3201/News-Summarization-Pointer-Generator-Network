Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik is smitten with a neo-Nazi called Beate Zschaepe.

He has sent her a letter praising her role in a terror cell which assassinated nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in a decade-long reign of terror.

Breivik, who slaughtered nearly 80 young people last year, said she should use her upcoming trial on murder and other charges ‘to spread right-wing propaganda!’

Infatuated: Anders Breivik has sent Beate Zschaepe a letter praising her role in a terror cell

He also called her a ‘courageous heroine of national resistance’ and addressed the letter to ‘Dear Sister Beate.’

‘Reveal your political motives to the population,’ said Breivik.

Details of the correspondence are revealed in this week’s edition of Der Spiegel magazine which went on sale on Sunday in Germany.

The three-sided letter is apparently full of admiration for the woman who was one of three main players in the National Socialist Underground; a death squad which idolised Hitler and wanted nothing less than the setting up of a ‘Fourth Reich’ in Germany.

It imploded in November last year when the two male members of the team took their own lives following a botched bank raid. Zschaepe was left with orders to blow up the gang’s HQ and destroy as much evidence of their activities as possible.

Neo-Nazi Beate Zschaepe was part of a terror cell that assassinated nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman

Since the NSU’s disintegration police have gathered evidence which suggests that Zschaepe was present at most murders and probably carried out several of them.

Breivik, who claimed at his murder trial that his killings were carried out as a ‘wake up call’ over multi-culturalism and unchecked immigration in Europe, is clearly spellbound by the woman who has been dubbed ‘The Nazi Mare’ in Germany.

‘You did everything to stop the multiculturalism and the Islamization of Germany,’ he went on.

But he said that the cell, which was based in the eastern German city of Zwickau, was wrong to target immigrant businessmen.

‘You should have gone for political elites instead,’ he advised. ‘But both forms of attack would damage the multicultural experiment.’

Breivik, 32, waxed lyrical about the ‘mission’ he sees himself and Zschaepe, 37, involved in, adding; ‘We are both among the first drops of rain that foretell the huge, cleansing storm about the break across Europe.

‘We are martyrs of the the conservative revolution and should be extremely proud of our sacrifice and our troubles.’ But his words never reached his jailbird sweetheart; the letter was seized by authorities in Germany and confiscated.

Breivik bombed government buildings in Oslo, resulting in eight deaths, then carried out a mass shooting at a camp of the Workers’ Youth League of the Labour Party on the island of Utøya, where he killed 69 people, mostly teenagers.

He was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism in August 2012 after being declared sane at the time of the atrocity. He was sentenced to 21 years in jail, serving a minimum of 10.
