A prisoner has escaped from a minimum-security prison in Victoria and remains to be on the run from police, who suspect he may have left with a woman believed to be his partner.

Stuart Holmes, 35, absconded from Dhurringile Prison, 160 km north of Melbourne, in Northern Victoria at approximately 3.30pm on Monday.

Police now want to speak with a woman named Kelly Doolan or Kelly Macdonald, and believe the pair were riding in a 2003 silver Nissan Pulsar with registration SKO-268.

The incident joins a string of escapes from the prison-farm this year, sparking concerns among the surrounding communities that the facility needs to improve its security.

Victorian police are currently scouring the surrounding areas to find Mr Holmes.

Investigators have released photographs and a description of the prisoner, who they said is ‘of Pacific Islander appearance and around 178cm tall with a solid build, brown eyes and short cropped greying hair.’

Mr Holmes is believed to have last been seen wearing prison greens, and may have escaped the area in a car.

Ms Macdonald is believed to be a 37-year-old from Benalla, and is described as Causcasian, 157cm tall with brown eyes and long blonde hair.

Durringhale Prison, a minimum security prison farm, is currently undergoing a government expansion program, including a growth in the prisoners being housed there, which is believed to be behind the rise in escapes.

Daily Mail Australia has learned the majority of recent escaped prisoners have left during times of romantic or familial complications, and apart from Mr Holmes, all of the escaped prisoners have been apprehended.

There is believed to have been 10 escapees in the past 14 months.

On April 30, the regional Director of the Justice Department addressed Dhurringile residents amidst growing concerns.

He assured the community that the type of prisoners being accepted into the facility, whom are classified as low risk, have not changed in their risk grading.

In August, 20 restricted minimum security inmates were transferred from Dhurringile to Loddon Prison in central Victoria after fears of the rising rates of escapees.

Mr Holmes escape joins a string of similar incidents from the Dhurringal Prison this year, sparking concerns amongst the surrounding communities that the facility needs to improve its security

 Mr Edward O'Donohue, the Victorian Minister of Corrections, said the department will wait for police to apprehend Mr Holmes

Many locals have voiced their concern over the topic. Frank Niglia, a resident of Dhurringile, told Daily Mail Australia: 

‘The community is very concerned. There has been a direct correlation between the increase in prisoners and the increase in escapes. Both have been steadily rising over the past decade,’ he said.

‘We’re meeting with the prison regularly, and submitted a review several months ago to look at the rise in escapes. We are meeting with the Minister for Corrections later this month.’

A spokesperson for Mr Edward O'Donohue, the Victorian Minister of Corrections, said 'Occasionally an offender will abscond. They are always caught and, when they are, they go straight back to medium or maximum security prisons and serve extra time if the courts order it.'

'In this case, residents were informed immediately under the system implemented this year through discussions with the Department of Justice,' Mr O'Donohue said.

'We will now wait for Victoria Police to do the job of finding and apprehending this offender.'

Victorian Police have said there is still no sign or Mr Holmes at the time of publication.
