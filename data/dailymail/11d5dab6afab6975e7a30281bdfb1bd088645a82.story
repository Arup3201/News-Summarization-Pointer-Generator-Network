A special grand jury today issued five indictments against Democrat Joseph Morrissey, from Henrico, Virginia, including allegations of illicit sex

A Democrat politician has been charged afterÂ  allegedly having sex with a minor, it was revealed today.

Joseph Morrissey, who represents Henrico, Virginia, was issued with five indictments by a grand jury on Monday.

These include felony counts of indecent liberties with a minor, 
possession of pornographic images of an underage female and of 
solicitation to obtain the images.

Special prosecutor William Neely told The Times-Dispatch: 'He had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it.'

Last August, Henrico police were asked
 to check on a 17-year-old girl by her father who was worried about her 
relationship with Morrissey.

Officers found the teenager and the 56-year-old at his townhouse.

The teenage girl, Morrissey and his lawyers claimed that the girl was a secretary in his law office who had lied about her age and that the relationship was 'appropriate and professional'.

They allegedly met up because the girl wanted to talk about personal problems.

Morrissey who is currently single and father to three daughters by three different women, was a 'consummate gentleman', according to his lawyer, Anthony Troy, a former state attorney general.

Mr Troy said that the young woman, her mother and her grandmother all denied that sex took place.

The grand jury has spent months deliberating the politician's case.

Morrissey, 56, also was indicted on Monday on a 
felony charge of distribution of child pornography and a misdemeanor 
charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The Democrat is facing up to 40 years in prison if convicted. The Democrat has been a state delegate since 2008.

He is now expected to be taken into custody by Henrico County police pending his arraignment. It is not clear if he will be released on bond.

In the early 1990s when he was a defense lawyer, he got into a punch-up with another attorney.

He had his legal license suspected in 2000 but failed to tell clients resulting in a nine-year revocation, according to the Times-Dispatch.

He was back in the spotlight in January 2013, when during a debate on gun control he pulled out an unloaded AK-47 and waved it around on the floor of the House of Delegates.
