Flanked by his family and a team of security guards, Rolf Harris cut a frail figure yesterday as he appeared in court for the first time to face sex abuse and child porn charges.

He is facing nine charges of indecent assault relating to attacks on two girls aged 14 and 15 in the 1980s and claims that he made four indecent images of children last year.

His counsel, Sonia Woodley QC, indicated that he would fight the charges.

The TV personality, artist and musician, who has been on screens for more than 50 years, was silent as he faced a barrage of cameras outside court.

Harris had to clutch the reinforced glass screen of the dock for support as he made his way into the courtroom.

Wearing a dark suit and 
patterned tie at the brief hearing, he spoke only to confirm his name, 
address and date of birth.

In the dock, he appeared bewildered, sitting motionless and ignoring deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, who twice had to order him to stand.

When asked to confirm his name, address and date of birth, he muttered: ‘Rolf Harris’ before hesitating, asking: ‘What was the next one?’

The Australian is accused of groping a 15-year-old girl between April 5, 1980 and April 4, 1981, and indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1986.

He is also charged with four offences of making indecent images of a child between March and July 2012.

After the law was changed to increased the punishment for offences committed after 1985, he could face up to ten years in jail if convicted.

Prosecutor Christine Athanasius said the sentencing powers of the court were ‘insufficient’.

She was briefly interrupted when the lights were mistakenly switched off, plunging the courtroom into darkness for a split second, before a security guard switched the power back on.

District judge Arbuthnot then referred the case to the crown court for trial, saying: ‘Clearly my powers are insufficient in this case.’

In the meantime, the entertainer and broadcaster has been banned from having unsupervised contact with any children.

Throughout the five-minute hearing, 
Harris stared straight ahead, glancing only once at the packed public 
gallery where his wife, Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, sat 
quietly with her daughter’s arm around her.

As he left court the painter, dressed in a dark suit, remained tight lipped as he fought his way through a media scrum.

He then helped his ailing wife, who was leaning on a walking stick, to a waiting people carrier.

Friends and family followed in another vehicle.

Harris has not spoken publicly since police first quizzed him in November last year.

Harris has been accused of assaulting two alleged victims, who were aged 14 and 15 at the time, between 1980 and 1986.

Rolf Harris has been charged with:

Six counts of 
indecent assault relating to a girl aged between 15 and 16, from 1980 to
1981.

Three offences of indecent assault relating to a girl aged 14,
in 1986.

Four offences of making indecent images of a child between March and July 2012.

He faces up to ten years in prison if convicted.

He was questioned under caution 
in November last year by officers working on Operation Yewtree, the 
national investigation launched after abuse claims were made against 
Jimmy Savile.

He was then arrested in March, and charged in August. The allegations against Harris have no connection to Savile.

Harris was 
released on bail on the conditions that he does not contact prosecution 
witnesses, lives at his home address in Bray, Berkshire and does not 
spend time with anyone under the age of 18 without being accompanied by 
someone over 21.

Harris, who painted a portrait of the 
Queen in 2005 and performed at her Diamond Jubilee concert last year, 
has been in the public eye for decades.

Couple: Rolf and Alwen Harris have been married for 55 years after meeting as students

He had his first musical hit Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport in 1960, and continued to enjoy success in the industry as well as forging a television career.

Harris, who has lived in Bray for more than 50 years, has also received a number of honours including the CBE, and was made Officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours last year.
