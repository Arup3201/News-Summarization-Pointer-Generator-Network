Burnley possessed the most English starting XI of any Premier League team in the last round of games, with seven players in Sean Dyche's team eligible to play for Roy Hodgson's men.

Tom Heaton, Ben Mee, Jason Shackell, Kieran Trippier, Ashley Barnes, David Jones and Danny Ings meet the criteria for selection, with none of the XI who played against Southampton on Saturday, March 21 drawn from outside the United Kingdom. However, none of that English contingent have yet featured in one of Hodgson's senior squads.

The pool of English talent has again been in the spotlight over the last fortnight with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke announcing changes to the work permit system and proposals to increase the number of homegrown players in Premier League squads, all with a view to boosting England's performance at major tournaments.

England and Tottenham striker Harry Kane was one of six Enlgish players to feature against Leicester City

Harry Kane - held up by Dyke as the sort of talent whose development must not be stifled by foreign imports - heads a six-strong group who featured for Tottenham against Leicester, including fellow new call-up Ryan Mason, while five of the Manchester United team which won at Liverpool were England internationals.

At the bottom end of the chart are the leading two teams in the Premier League, Chelsea and Manchester City. Central defensive pair Gary Cahill and John Terry were part of Jose Mourinho's defence as they won 3-2 at Hull - another team with just two England-qualified starters - while Manchester City had only Joe Hart and retired England midfielder Frank Lampard in their XI.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been credited for adding a greater English element to his side in recent years, but the team which won at Newcastle featured only two who would qualify - Calum Chambers and Danny Welbeck.

Overall, only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent.

England face Italy on Tuesday night, and the proportion of players in Serie A starting line-ups who were born in Italy - or have otherwise represented Italy at senior level - over the same weekend was 43.2 per cent. That proportion would increase still further if you included those who may qualify under residency rules or those - typically of South American birth - who hold Italian passports due to their ancestry.

In the English Championship, the most 'English' teams were Blackburn and Huddersfield with nine, with a few caveats.

Huddersfield duo Sean Scannell and Joel Lynch both appear to have nailed their colours to the masts of the Republic of Ireland and Wales respectively, yet neither has made a senior competitive appearance yet so are still technically eligible for England.

Adam Henley is still England-qualified for Blackburn after he was an unused substitute in Wales' Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel. Until Matt Ritchie featured for Scotland against Gibraltar on Sunday, Bournemouth also had nine, with the Cherries' Republic of Ireland call-up Harry Arter still England-qualified as he did not feature for the Irish against Poland.

League Two's AFC Wimbledon fielded eleven English players in their most recent game against Tranmere

Also flying the flag of St George with an all-English XI were Hartlepool United (pictured) and Southend United 

The percentage of England-qualified players starting in the Championship was 57.2 per cent, rising to 76.1 per cent in League One and 86.0 per cent in League Two.

Five teams in League One - Bristol City, Chesterfield, Colchester, Crewe and Rochdale - were just one player shy of an entirely England-qualified XI.

You had to go down to League Two to find a fully England-qualified XI, with AFC Wimbledon, Hartlepool and Southend flying the flag. Southend's Adam Thompson has won two caps for Northern Ireland, but both came in the 2011 Nations Cup which does not classify as an official competition under FIFA regulations, so he technically remains eligible for England.

Survey Criteria 

*Players born in England or with an English parent or grandparent qualified as English for the purposes of this survey, provided they had not played a competitive senior international for another team. Matches for other countries at youth level, or in senior friendlies or games not classed as official competition do not make the player ineligible for England.

*FIFA rules permit a player to gain residency after five years' continuous living in their adopted country, provided they had not played a competitive senior international for another team. However, under a Home Nations agreement, it is understood the residency rules for England eligibility are different. If not born in England, a player must have spent at least five years in education in England prior to his 18th birthday to be eligible.

*For Serie A, only players born in Italy or otherwise having represented Italy at national team level were counted in our survey. Many other players may qualify under residency rules or hold Italian passports owing to their parents or grandparents.
