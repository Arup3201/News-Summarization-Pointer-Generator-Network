Brits are being ripped off by resort shops while on holiday – with prices up to 53 per cent more expensive than out-of-town supermarkets.

New figures show travellers on self-catering trips abroad should head outside their resorts to get the lowest prices, according to Post Office Travel Money and holiday company Cosmos.

The biggest disparity was in Majorca, where basic provisions for a one-week family holiday cost £86 in supermarkets but were as much as £133 - or 53 per cent more - in resort shops.

Price difference: Tourists are being advised to buy basic produce out of town rather than resort shops

While in the Portuguese Algarve, products were found to be 48 per cent more expensive at a resort mini-market than at a supermarket.

Including items such as bread, milk and breakfast cereals, supermarket costs in the Algarve were just £56 for one week, but as much as £83 at an in-resort mini-market.

Those able to get to supermarkets would also get better value in Lanzarote, Crete, Minorca, Majorca and Limassol in Cyprus.

Rip off: Local shops in destinations such as Mallorca are more expensive, according to the survey

The next best-value supermarket prices (£59) were to be found on Spain's Costa Blanca, which was one of the few destinations surveyed where resort prices were better value than supermarket ones.

Of the destinations in the survey, Limassol had the highest supermarket prices, with the provisions costing £94.

Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: ‘Self-catering can be a great way to save money on holiday but the wide price variations between resorts makes it important to do some homework before booking.

‘Our research shows that well over half of families bust their holiday budget by hundreds of pounds and food shopping is one of the main reasons why.’
