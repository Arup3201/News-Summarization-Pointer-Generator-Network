Alan Lewis, a key ally of David Cameron, will not face charges

A senior Tory politician arrested over allegations that he raped a teenage girl will not be charged after the CPS concluded there was insufficient evidence.

Alan Lewis, who owns the Crombie clothing chain, was quizzed at a London police station in September over claims he attacked a teenage student in the 1960s in a hotel.

A CPS spokesman said:'The Crown Prosecution Service has carefully considered the evidence gathered by Greater Manchester Police in relation to their investigations into an allegation of rape in the Manchester area in 1967.

'A 75 year old man was arrested in September in connection with the allegation.  

'The case has been reviewed by two specialist rape prosecutors in CPS North West Area in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the CPS policy for prosecuting cases of rape and CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences.

'We have concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to the allegation and have advised Greater Manchester Police that no further action should be taken.

'The complainant has been informed of the decision and we will be meeting her to provide an explanation of the decision and to answer any questions she may have.'

Mr Lewis, a key ally of David Cameron, is believed to be worth around £220million.

The 75-year-old’s arrest came as the Conservative Party prepared for its annual conference in Manchester.

The allegations were brought by a married woman from Dorset who is now in her 60s.

Mr Lewis, a committed Christian, was asked to attend a station in Belgravia, central London.

He was then arrested on suspicion of raping the student in a Manchester hotel while on a business trip.

She lived in the city at the time of the alleged attack.

Mr
Lewis has been a central Tory figure since the 80s and was chairman of 
the Confederation of British Industry from 1988 to 1990. He was awarded a
CBE in 1990.

In 2010, Mr Cameron made him a vice chairman of the Tory party with responsibility for business matters.

He is one of nine Tory vice chairmen and women who lead party efforts to improve relations with the business community.

The multi-millionaire, who grew up in Manchester and has homes in London and Florida, made his fortune turning around ailing textile firms.

Crombie has three stand-alone stores in London, Manchester and Edinburgh and is also sold through independent retailers such as Harrods.
