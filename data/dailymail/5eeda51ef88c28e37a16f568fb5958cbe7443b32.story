The base jumpers who filmed as they leaped off One World Trade Center in a daredevil stunt have said they didn't mean to be disrespectful.

James Brady and Andrew Rossig, who leaped off the 104th floor of Freedom Tower with their friend, Marko Markovich, in September, said the jump was supposed to be a private moment.

But, after handing themselves into police Monday, the friends uploaded footage of the jump, made at 3am on September 30, last year. The video has quickly gone viral, with more than 200,000 views in just over one day.

Their actions were condemned by the Port Authority and New York Police Department, which said the jump 'violated the spirit of respect and reverence for this sacred site that almost all connected with the WTC project feel'.

In an interview on GMA this morning however, Brady, who worked on a construction team building the tower, and Rossig, said they were just thrill seekers who had meant no harm.

'Everybody has their thing. This is our thing ... we were thinking that very clearly that everything was working out for us to make a clean safe jump,' Brady, 32, said.

Rossig added: 'We had no intention of being disrespectful,' as the friends explained how they had found a blind spot in the site's security camera coverage, and a hole in the fence, that let them slip in unnoticed.  

The 33-year-old added that it was supposed to have been a 'peaceful, quiet moment' and said he was surprised that police came looking for them six months after the jump. 

'We were a little bit shocked that they spent that much time and energy continuing to pursue something that they knew was not a terroristic act,' he said.

'Our intent was never for this to go public. We never posted the video footage. People didn’t know about it. We kept things quiet. As far as we were concerned, no one ever needed to know,' he added.

Police had tracked the group down 
using surveillance footage from the area they landed in. 'Just a little 
snippet of video that we had of someone landing on the West Side Highway
 with a parachute around 4am. That’s all we had to work with initially,'
 Commissioner William Bratton said.

The
 five-minute clip filmed by one of the base jumpers was posted on Monday
 as the three jumpers; Brady, Rossig, and Markovich, 27, and their 
alleged lookout, Kyle Hartwell, 29, 
all from New York, handed themselves in to NYPD.

According
 to Rossig's attorney, the film was seized by police last month after a 
search of the men's homes, but has only now been posted online.

All proceeds made from advertisement revenue will be donated to charity, the group has said.

The four, who pleaded not guilty, face charges of burglary and trespassing as well as misdemeanor 
reckless endangerment and misdemeanor jumping from a structure. They have been released on $3,500 bail.

‘It's a fair 
amount of free-fall time,’ he said. ‘You really get to enjoy the view of
 the city and see it from a different perspective.’

Rossig,
 an avid BASE jumper said the skydivers took care to keep from endangering anyone, 
choosing a time when streets would be largely deserted.

While a majority of YouTube users are 
applauding the group's daring jump, some criticised their choice of 
doing so just weeks after the anniversary of 9/11.

Ted
 Morris wrote 'Does any one see the irony of this guys JUMPING from 1 
world trade? kind of eerie, being that about 13 years ago hundreds were 
doing it... to their deaths. (sic)

Others
 turned on the NYPD for arresting the men. User dt089 commented: 'I love
 how the U.S. government is so quick to punish these men. "Illegally 
base jumping from a landmark".

'Lmao. Then we wonder why we have by far the highest incarceration rate on the planet...and growing.'

Brady had worked on the building site 
and was one of the workers pictured installing a steel beam with 
president Obama’s signature on the One WTC’s 104th floor in January last
 year.

On Monday,
Brady was accused of smuggling in the gear the group used to carry 
out the death-defying stunt in the early hours of September 30 last 
year.

‘This is an inside person who 
apparently went rogue for his own self-glorification,’ a law enforcement
 source told the New York Post.

Rossig said the jumpers got in simply by walking through a gap in a 
fence, however a law enforcement source disputed that account.

He claimed Brady used his work access to secret his parachuting pals into the site, a statement Brady's attorney denied.

The
 NYPD said last fall that investigators were looking for two 
parachutists in dark jumpsuits seen floating near the building around 
3am on September 30, but did not signal that arrests were imminent until
 a New Jersey teenager was arrested for trespassing at the WTC last 
week.

Police Commissioner Bratton said the investigation was a joint endeavor by the NYPD and the Port Authority police.

‘These
 men violated the law and placed themselves, as well as others, in 
danger,’ PC Bratton said.

‘These arrests should send a message to anyone 
thinking about misusing a landmark this way. They will be tracked down 
and they will face serious charges. Being a thrill-seeker does not give 
immunity from the law.’

The
 NYPD devotes more than 200 officers, surveillance cameras and other 
technology to protect the perimeter of the site, while Port Authority 
police and private security agents guard the inside. Ultimately, plans 
call for a $40 million system of barriers and checkpoints around the 
16-acre trade center site.

This is the second criminal case in two weeks arising from surreptitious stunts at the nation's tallest skyscraper.

Casquejo, 16, from New Jersey was arrested on a misdemeanour 
trespassing charge after slipping through a gap in a fence, using a lift
 and sneaking past a sleeping security guard to spend about two hours 
atop the 1,776-foot-tall tower earlier this month.

The
 incidents have raised questions about security at the lower Manhattan 
site, which is supposed to be one of the most tightly protected in the 
country. The site is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey.
