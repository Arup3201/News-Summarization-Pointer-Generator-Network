A Russian female punk bank band jailed for singing protests songs against president Vladimir Putin are to be freed later today after going on hunger strike, their lawyer has claimed.

The three members of Pussy Riot were jailed for hooliganism after bursting into a cathedral in masks and staging a performance criticising the church's support of Putin. They also stood on top of a wall in Red Square in Moscow with speakers blaring out anti-Putin lyrics.

The rock trio - two of whom have young children - were held without bail while their case was prepared. The move sparked protests by their supporters around their world.

Band members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Maria Alekhina went on hunger strike last earlier this month amid concerns that the case was being prepared so that their defence team was at a disadvantage.

But a lawyer for the women said today that the women will be freed at a scheduled hearing.

'I have information from the most reliable source that the girls will be freed,' Pussy Riot lawyer Nikolai Polozov said, according to Interfax.

Earlier he tweeted: 'Tomorrow after the hearing at the court on Pussy Riot something sensational awaits.'

Pussy Riot supporter Alina Oraztsova tweeted: 'Lawyers for Pussy Riot said they received a call from the presidential administration and tomorrow they will free Pussy Riot.'

The developments raised hopes among supporters that the feminist trio's fight for justice could have turned a corner.

The young women are charged with hooliganism by an organised group, an offence with a maximum jail term of seven years. It is an exceptionally harsh charge for holding an unsanctioned protest.

The radical group previously sang raucous anthems against Putin's government in public places. Its members wore brightly coloured balaclavas to conceal their faces and they used nicknames.

In February, they climbed into an area reserved for priests in the central Church of Christ the Saviour and began singing a song criticising the Russian Orthodox Church's close ties to the Kremlin, before being dragged away by guards.

Their rendition of a punk prayer called 'Holy Mother, throw Putin out!' was a protest against the church's support of Putin in the presidential election he won in March.

The offence prompted Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill to hold an open-air prayer service with thousands of worshippers gathering outside the building as he said they had desecrated holy relics kept there.

Rights groups including Amnesty International previously called for the 'immediate release' of the band members.

More than 100 of Russia's best known actors, directors and musicians called for the women's release in an open letter last month, saying they presented no 'real danger' to society and that the criminal case against them compromised the Russian judicial system.

Supporters include Dmitry Bykov and one of Russia's most popular actresses Chulpan Khamatova, who publicly supported Putin in his campaign for reelection to the Kremlin.

'I just want the girls to go home to their children,' she said in televised comments.

It girl television presenter turned activist Ksenia Sobchak, whose apartment was recently raided as part of a probe into an opposition protest, on Twitter called the extended detention 'a terrible injustice'.

'Criminals walk free, no one bothers with them, while they have to take revenge for an anti-Putin song!' wrote opposition lawmaker Gennady Gudkov on Twitter.

Earlier this month a court extended by a month the detention of band - sparking more anger at their treatment.

Police said they detained around 20 people outside Moscow's Tagansky district court after supporters sang couplets of the group's song and a pro-Kremlin youth group held placards saying 'Heretics, know the law!'.

Those detained including several Russian Orthodox activists. Several protesters had smeared cosmetic masks on their faces, in protest at a new law forbidding people at rallies from wearing masks.

The women, initially arrested in early March, had their pre-trial detention extended until July 24, adding a month to a previous extension.

'We are not enemies of the Christian faith... We will never plead guilty of the charges we are charged with,' singer Tolokonnikova, 22, said at an earlier hearing.

Prosecutors have argued the women could commit fresh crimes or attempt to flee justice if they were not held behind bars before their trial, now expected to be held in August.
