It's still rolling. The red paint may have been chipped, the bodywork a bit bashed up and the foot has perhaps eased on the accelerator ever so slightly. But the juggernaut keeps moving along.

The notion that a home draw with Dundee could possibly be construed as a point gained by the Dons would have seemed faintly absurd before kick-off. Eight straight league wins without conceding tends to offer that kind of all-or-nothing perspective.

By the time Ryan Jack bundled home the sixth and final goal of an enthralling match deep into injury time, though, no one was thinking of two points lost - save the sizeable, shell-shocked Dark Blue contingent of course.

Two goals behind with three minutes of regulation time to play, the salvation of the match from the league leaders was every bit as remarkable as the fact they had not bludgeoned Dundee into submission by the time half-an-hour had elapsed.

It was a captivating, bizarre afternoon. The kind of day when neither laughing nor crying seemed appropriate for either manager. Once breath had been drawn, Derek McInnes was closer to the former, with Paul Hartley, his opposite number, solemnly scratching around for positives. There were many of those.

Dundee were magnificent in patches, most notably in the 10 minutes before half-time when Gary Irvine and Greg Stewart finished excellent team moves to cancel out David Goodwillie’s opener.

They were efficient and effective for much of the second period and not ill-deserving of the deflection that took Gary Harkins’ volley beyond Scott Brown to make it 3-1 - only to wilt at the end when their leaden feet became planted in their own box.

You could only admire Aberdeen’s steadfast refusal to bow down to the seemingly inevitable.

Invigorated by the late introductions of Willo Flood, Cammy Smith and, most tellingly, Lawrence Shankland, they strained every sinew to restore parity with two late goals. A crowd of nigh on 17,000 inside Pittodrie bellowed its approval at their favourites’ indefatigability.

If this goes down as a bad day at the office by recent standards, then they will take them now and again.

It almost goes without saying that, if hopes of the title are to remain alive, they won’t want to be emulating Harry Houdini too often but, occasionally, such acts of escapology are necessary.

Shankland, a 19-year-old contemporary of Andrew Robertson from their Queen’s Park days, was the unlikely hero of the hour.

Thrown from the bench to replace Adam Rooney with seven minutes remaining, he repeatedly displayed that most coveted of striking habits - being in the right place at the right time.

Having made sure Kostadin Gadzhalov clipped his ankles to allow Jonny Hayes to score from the spot on 87 minutes, he then teed up Jack with a headed flick in the second of four added-on minutes to win a point that was celebrated as fervently as any last-gasp victory.

The Dons may have had their lead at the top over Celtic cut to two points but, as Dundee found to their cost, their grasp of the meaning of the word defeat is becoming increasingly flimsy.

‘We all believed,’ said Shankland. ‘You never give up in a game and there were still a lot of minutes to go. Ten minutes is enough to score two goals, as we showed. We are delighted to get the draw in the end.’

The expected script was being rigidly adhered to when Goodwillie smashed Rooney’s cross high beyond Scott Bain inside seven minutes, the goal stemming from Niall McGinn picking Irvine’s pocket.

For the next 20 minutes, the only debate seemed the margin of Aberdeen’s victory.

Rooney somehow missed a pinch from three yards after Hayes’ initial shot had been blocked by a defender, Jack’s strike flew a yard wide and Dundee just couldn’t get up for air.

Then, remarkably, having not lost a league goal in 757 minutes, the Dons conceded two in 180 seconds.

Irvine redeemed himself with a lung-bursting run and a splendid finish to a sweeping six-pass move. Then, before calm could be restored, Stewart marched onto Luka Tankulic’s sumptuous flick and artfully found the bottom corner with the outside of his boot.

Had Rooney found the net and not the base of the post two minutes after the restart, the game may have veered in a different direction but, as it was, Harkins’ fearsome volley, which nipped the leg of Ash Taylor, a minute later set the hare racing.

If question marks were raised about whether Aberdeen were about to suffer a serious blow to their aspirations, there seemed no doubt about the validity of Alan Muir’s spot-kick award, which Hayes just about squeezed past the Dundee keeper and, from that moment on, the visitors were on the ropes.

Shay Logan’s speculative cross was helped on by Shankland and Jack’s gamble paid off handsomely as he bundled the ball home from a matter of two yards.

Every title-winning team enjoys such moments of relief.

McInnes stated afterwards that it could be a huge point for his side but was characteristically elusive when pressed on exactly what it could mean in the final reckoning.

Improvement - whether week by week or season on season - remains the mantra of those inside Pittodrie.

Shankland, the scorer of 19 goals for the development team this season, is certainly growing in stature and is the kind of livewire presence that suggests the depth of McInnes’ squad is very much in keeping with that of a genuine title contender.

‘We looked out of it at the end, but I managed to get two assists,’ beamed the 19-year-old Glaswegian. ‘The manager sent me on and told me to do what I could. He said: “You have got your minutes on the pitch, so go and do what you can.”

‘The gaffer wants me to score goals and that is my job as a striker. I have not managed to score, but I got the assists, so I am happy.

‘I am confident. I try to get myself into good positions on the pitch and, hopefully, I can put one in.’

Not quite confident enough yet to spot the ball for the penalty he won, however.

‘No, there are a few experienced boys and I left it to them,’ smiled Shankland. ‘Jonny took it well, to be fair.’

Despite the formidable figures of Goodwillie and Rooney standing ahead of him in the queue for a starting berth, in Jack - again invaluable to the Dons’ cause here - Shankland sees a road map to regular involvement.

‘We have a really strong squad and the strikers have been doing really well and scoring goals,’ he said.

‘They have created a lot for the team and so I had to be patient, work hard in training and, when I get my chance, I know I have to have as much impact on the game as I can.

‘Jacko is a good player and we have a lot of them at the club. They have taken their chance when it has come along and that is what I need to do to get myself into the team.’

And so to McDiarmid Park on Friday. Shorn of Taylor for around a month after the defender hobbled off with a knee complaint around the hour mark, McInnes will have to move his pieces around the board and re-strategise.

But they are still in the game.
