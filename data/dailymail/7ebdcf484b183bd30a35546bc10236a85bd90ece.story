A good arrest can make an officer's career, but one police recruit 
ended up in trouble because of an entirely different kind of bust.

A woman hoping to join the police in Germany was told she couldn't sign up because of her breast implants.

The force argued that the silicone implants could cause 
problems if she was made to wear a flak jack or stab vest.

A German police recruit has been told she can join the force despite having breast implants because they pose no more risk than natural breasts of the same size

Officials said that the implants would put excessive pressure on her chest and would cause fibrosis or another chest condition.

However
the recruit has been told by a Berlin court that she can join, after a 
judge ruled that implants were no more dangerous than women with natural
 breasts of the same size.

The officer was not named due to German privacy laws.

It is not the first time the German police force has got into trouble over fake breasts.

In
 December last year it was revealed that a male doctor with the North 
Rhine-Westphalia force had been asking women to remove their bras during
 a routine medical exam to check for implants.

The force had tried to argue that stab vests and riot gear would put excessive pressure on her chest and cause fibrosis or a similar chest condition (file pic)

The medic was 
supposed to be carrying out a five-yearly exam to check the officers' 
fitness to drive, but argued that it was sensible to check for implants 
as they could become damaged.

Stephen Hegger, a spokesman for the 
police branch, said at the time that breast implants were recorded as 
they could burst 'if someone grabbed them on the street'.

According
 to The Local, the interior ministry said that 'touching a woman's 
breasts for implants was not appropriate' and said officers would no 
longer have to take off their bras during examinations.
