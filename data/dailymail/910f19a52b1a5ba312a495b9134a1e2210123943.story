It seems that Monaco's owners are not the only big spenders at the club - their players are quite willing to splash the cash too.

Well,  Aymen Abdennour is anyway. The Tunisian centre-back celebrated his 25th birthday on Wednesday by buying pizzas for his team-mates and having them delivered to the training ground changing rooms.

Abdennour, who signed permanently for the principality club from Toulouse this summer following a six-month loan, ordered more than 20 pizzas for his team-mates, including forward Radamel Falcao, to enjoy after training.

The club also tweeted a birthday message to Abedennour, saying: 'RT to wish a happy birthday to Aymen Abdennour who turns 25 today!'

Meanwhile, Monaco have unveiled a new all-white Nike third kit which they will wear in European competition this season.
