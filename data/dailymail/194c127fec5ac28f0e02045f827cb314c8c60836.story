While most budgies are known to spread their wings and fly around the living room, this particular bird prefers a different mode of transport. 

This budgie, called Champ, was completely enthralled by his owner's tennis ball - particularly after he was successful in climbing atop it.

Despite losing his footing several times, the bird chirped with delight while performing his trick.

Even when he looses his footing, the bird quickly nudges the ball back into place and hops back on

At one point, the tennis ball escaped the small bird and rolled under a cabinet.

Not one to be discouraged, the resourceful budgie used his beak to nudge the ball out into the sun-drenched living room.

He quickly hopped back on for another go, impressively balancing for several seconds each time.
