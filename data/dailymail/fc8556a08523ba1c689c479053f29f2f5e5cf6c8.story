Nothing sums up the gap between Burnley and their first Premier League opponents Chelsea quite like the sight of manager Sean Dyche conducting his opening press conference in the lounge of an old bungalow overlooking the club’ s picturesque Gawthorpe Hall training ground.

It used to be the home of Burnley’s former groundsman and 1960s striker Arthur Bellamy which might explain the anaglypta wallpaper. 'I grew up with this,’ says Dyche admiringly. 'I remember stripping it off my bedroom wall. No health and safety or nothing.’

The 43-year-old probably wouldn’t think twice about doing the same now. After all, he celebrated Burnley’s promotion from the Championship in April by putting together a bed for his son Max.

On a high: Sean Dyche guided Burnley to the Premier League last season 

Ready for battle: Dyche and Burnley will face Chelsea in their first game back in the Premier League

As this old Lancashire town prepares to welcome Premier League football for the second time when Chelsea visit Turf Moor on Monday, Dyche remains typically unaffected by the hype.

‘I put together a bed for my son and it brings normality to me,’ he said. ‘I cut the lawn for a reason – the kids have to learn that’s what dads do.

‘It keeps me a bloke because I am just a bloke. I don’t get too worried about “oh look at you, Premier League!” It’s not really my bag that.

‘The Premier League manager tag doesn’t make me feel any different. I still go home and take the kids into the garden for a game of football, and I let my daughter do my head in asking for a new dress, every day. She’s nine going on 16. My life is the same outside of this. I’m no different.’

Comparisons: Dyche has the nickname 'The ginger Mourinho' and will face the real deal on Monday

Keeping things largely the same is the key to Dyche keeping Burnley in the top-flight. There have been six new signings so far and changes are inevitable (the home dressing-room has been upgraded, for instance, though not the away one). 

But he has to draw on the togetherness and team sprit that took Burnley up against the odds if they are to defy the bookmakers again by not going straight back down, as happened in 2010.

The fixture list has not been particularly kind. The season starts with Chelsea and a match-up between Mourinho and the man they call the Ginger Mourinho. Burnley’s second game at Turf Moor is against Manchester United, the team they beat in their home opener five years ago.

‘There will be a vast gap in resources available, that’s the reality of it,’ said Dyche. ‘There are probably still eight Championship clubs I could name off the bat who have got a better player wage level than we have now.

‘But look at what you’ve got not what you haven’t. We have to find a way of operating to get where we want. Behind my extremely bouncer-like look, there are a couple of brain cells in there.

‘Never say never. Was it Cardiff who got three points off Man City early last season? I don’t think many would have been expecting that.

‘There are no guarantees in any division in any season, let alone the Premier League, so we have to earn the right and fight hard to get what we can off anyone.’
