A father only found out  that his son was knocked down by a taxi while on holiday in Florida after his family read about the accident online on Christmas Day.

Stuart Robb, 23, from Easter Ross in the Highlands, was celebrating his cousin's graduation in Daytona Beach earlier this month, when he was hit by a car as he crossed the street. 

His father Karl Inness, 48, only learned that his son Stuart Robb was in a coma after his sister read about the accident on her local newspaper's website in Aberdeen.

He said: 'It was a huge shock, especially on Christmas Day. I was very upset. I just feel absolutely helpless because I can't get over there.

'My sister phoned and asked if I'd heard about Stuart, she had heard about it online. He had been hit by a taxi.'

Having heard the news, Karl called round all the hospitals in the region to find out where his son was being treated.

He said that Stuart remains in an induced coma at the Halifax Health-Medical Centre having had surgery for a blood clot in his brain.

His mother Angela has said her son was 'critical but stable' and Stuart's sister has joined him at his bedside in a Florida hospital. 

Stuart, from Balintore in Easter Ross, is understood to have been in Florida to visit his cousin, Ally Macdonald.

Ally had been due to graduate from a university in Daytona Beach and his cousin had been due to attend the ceremony, it is understood.

Graeme Vass, a friend of Stuart's said: 'It sounds like he stepped on to the road but looked the wrong way. He’s looked to the side we would over here and didn’t see the car. I’d heard it was a taxi.'

He added: 'He’s just a nice, steady guy. I’ve known him forever from about the town. I hope he pulls through.'

Days before the accident the pair had visited Walt Disney World resort in Orlando with Stuart posting a picture of them at the theme park online.

His father said: 'I can't do anything to help - he is just so far away.

'I am just hoping he is going to pull through. We won't know until he comes out of the coma what is going to happen.'

Mr Inness had not met his son until he was 18 but they now keep in touch.

He said: 'I spoke to him just before he went on holiday and he was so excited about going.

'I said he would have to come here to pick up his Christmas present when he got back.'
