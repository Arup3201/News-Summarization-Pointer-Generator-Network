Demi Moore made her first public appearance tonight since her recent spell in rehab.

The 49-year-old actress has had a troubling few months, following the breakdown of her marriage to Ashton Kutcher.

But tonight - a day after she made her Twitter comeback - the Ghost star attended soiree in Beverly Hills to support her best friend Amanda de Cadenet.

well: The actress looked healthier and appeared to have put on some

Conversation, which Moore executive produces

Demi made a brief turn in front of the cameras and certainly looked healthier and like she had put on some much needed weight.

Last year the star's drastically 
shrinking frame sparked alarm and she looked a shadow of her former self
as she stepped out to the premiere of her movie Margin Call in New York
back in October.

But tonight was a different story. She looked relaxed and happy, wearing a black ensemble, beige blouse and chic jewellery.

She was flanked by Ariel Foxman, 
Editor of InStyle magazine, and her pal Amanda to celebrate the launch 
of her TV show The Conversation, which Demi executive produces.

Moore also found time to tweet her fans, revealing she is finally ready to change her Twitter name @MrsKutcher.

'Time for a change, twitter name change... any suggestions?' she wrote.

Moore announced her intention to divorce Kutcher last November - although proceedings are yet to be executed by either party.

Tweetheart: Moore returned to Twitter on Monday after a three-month hiatus and posted a picture of herself lying down on her bed

It followed claims he had cheated on her with partygirl Sara Leal during a seedy night in San Diego.

Demi checked out of Utah's Cirque 
Lodge in March, where she was allegedly treated for eating disorder 
issues, exhaustion and substance abuse.

It came after she was hospitalised 
after she suffered a seizure-like episode at her Benedict Canyon home 
after smoking a substance, described on the 911 call as 'like incense'.

On Monday Moore returned to Twitter after a spell away from the social networking site she once so regularly frequented.

Demi is seen lying on her bed with her shoes on and the snap shows her glasses, nose and chin and her legs.

The actress has been keeping a low profile in recent weeks and has not been spotted out and about.

Meanwhile her estranged husband Ashton
has been linked to Rihanna and Lorene Scafaria in recent weeks and has 
also been spotted in the company of a mystery blonde in the past week 
alone.

Kutcher has also been linked to his former That '70s Show co-star Mila Kunis.
