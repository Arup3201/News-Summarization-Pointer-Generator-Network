Charlie Sheen has rushed to ex-wife Brooke Mueller's defence following her arrest this weekend in Aspen for possession of cocaine with intent to supply.

The former Two And A Half Men star says he does not believe Mueller would have been trying to sell the drug - because he gives her all the cash she needs in child support.

Sheen - who pays her $55,000 per month - told TMZ: 'With the child support I give her... she's gonna deal drugs? Never gonna happen.'

The 46-year-old actor also laid into Aspen police who arrested Mueller - saying: 'The cops in Aspen are 
Keystone on their finest day ... these are the clowns that let [Ted] 
Bundy go.'

Mueller has vowed to 'vigorously defend' the cocaine possession allegations.

The 34-year-old was arrested in Aspen on Saturday and booked for a 
felony cocaine possession with the intention to distribute and for a 
third degree misdemeanour assault charge.

But her rep told Us Weekly that she has since been released on an 
$11,000 bond and is back at home - after arriving back to LA on Monday.

She is with her two-year-old twin sons Bob and Max from her marriage to Sheen, ahead of her court date on 
December 19.

'Brooke is back home in Los Angeles spending quiet time with her 
children,' said her spokesman, adding that her lawyer, 'will vigorously 
defend Brooke with the goal of having all charges dropped once the facts
of the case come to light.'

'Contrary to reports in the media, there will be no changes in the 
custody arrangement; the children are remaining with Brooke.

'Both 
Charlie and Brooke's mother have offered to support Brooke in any way 
they can,' added the rep.Â 

Brooke is alleged to have partied the 
night away on Friday night at the Belly Up Club in Aspen, leaving her 
children with a nanny.

She was arrested after a woman 
reported her for assault - but upon searching her cops claim to have 
discovered a large quantity of cocaine on her.

A
spokesman for the City of Aspen and Pitkin County Police said in a statement: 
'Officers with the Aspen Police Department were on a routine walk 
through' of the Belly Up bar 'when a woman reported an assault had 
taken place.

'The woman identified Brooke Mueller as the aggressor.'

A
search was then launched and the reality star was tracked down to another nightclub after midnight, where she was arrested.

The
police spokesman said: 'Mueller was arrested and charged with assault 
in the third degree (class one misdemeanour) and possession of cocaine 
with intent to distribute (class four felony).'

While
the assault charge is a less serious misdemeanour case, the drugs 
charges could see the reality star could face up to six years in jail if
found guilty.

A police 
spokesman added: 'When someone is found to have more than a certain 
amount of the drug, they are charged with intent to distribute.'

Mueller was released after posting bail, but must return for a District Court hearing on December 19.

Meanwhile, Sheen accidentally tweeted his cell phone number on twitter last night.

'Call me bro,' he wrote with the telephone number preceding it.

The post has since been removed.
