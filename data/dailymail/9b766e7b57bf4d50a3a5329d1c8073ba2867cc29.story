Mariah Carey's four-legged friends are gearing up to take the trip of a lifetime.

The singer, 44, is splashing out a massive £15,000 
on sending her elaborately named pets: Jill E Beans, The Good Reverend Pow Jackson, 
Pipitty Jackson, Cha Cha, Jackie Lambchops, JJ, Squeak E Beans and 
Mutley P Gore Jackson The Third to Paw Seasons, a luxury dog hotel in Bristol.

The pooches will be sleeping in their own beds and be groomed and washed and taken on day trips to the surrounding areas, such as the 
Victorian seaside town of Clevedon, following the coastal route around 
the bay, or to see the bluebell woods at Belmont Hill.

The cute canines will be waited on hand-and paw during their stay, with every meal tailor-made by a personal chef, according to a menu plan which Mariah is sending over. 

The hotel, just outside Bristol, in Long Ashton, features a 400-year old Grade II Listed cottage and walled gardens.

Lucky pets are also offered surfing, board games and swimming, along with dog-orientated movies such as 101 Dalmatians and
 Lassie.

Last year, the hotel was the first of its kind in the world to offer a truly luxury dog package: which featured designer Louis Vuitton collars, 
Bottega Veneta leads, a Mulberry mackintosh and animal behavioural specialist Stan Rawlinson to  help the pet open up about its life during one-on-one psychiatry 
sessions.

The package, which set owners back a massive £47,000 also featured limousine transfers, a private chef,  reiki treatments, pedicures, and British Olympic hurdler Dai Greene was on
 hand to take the pampered pet for runs.

Owners left with a custom made pet  mascot, as well as a portrait
 of the dog and a DVD featuring the highlights of the holiday.

Jenny Hytner-Marriott, founder of the hotel, said: ‘Being the leaders in luxury breaks for dogs, we wanted to be the first to offer the most spectacular luxury holiday a dog could wish for.’

The Paw Seasons is also in Alderton, Wiltshire and Hawkesbury Common, near Badminton Wiltshire.
