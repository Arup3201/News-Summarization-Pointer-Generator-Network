Fifteen British nationals are suspected of being part of an Islamic training camp in Syria, it emerged yesterday during a court appearance by an NHS doctor accused of kidnapping a photographer in the war-torn country.

Shajul Islam, 26, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court accused of snatching a British photographer and a Dutch journalist in Syria.

Islam, who completed his medical 
training at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in East London, left the UK for 
Syria earlier this year, it was said.

yesterday accused of holding a British photographer and Dutch journalist
hostage in Syria

He was arrested at Heathrow Airport last week after he arrived on a flight from Egypt with his wife and one-year-old daughter, the court was told.

Islam is accused of false imprisonment under terrorism legislation. It is alleged that he, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans against their will between July 17 and 26.

When Mr Cantlie, who has worked for the Sunday Times, returned to Britain, he told how he and Mr Oerlemans were handcuffed and blindfolded.

Fearing they would be executed, they made a failed bid to escape during which both were shot at.Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were finally freed with the help of the Free Syria Army.

Hunt: British security services are trying to trace men who allegedly flew from the UK to join the terror cell in Bab al-Hawa, an area in the north of Syria the country close to the Turkish border

Rescue: Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were finally freed with the help of the Free Syria Army

Piers Arnold, prosecuting, told the court: ‘They were threatened at gunpoint, blindfolded and restrained.’ It is believed that the 40 people in the camp came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

He said: ‘[There were] Chechens and youngsters engaged in jihad conflict for the first time.‘A significant number of individuals appeared to be British - 15 British nationals were in the camp.’

Mozammel
Hossain, defending Islam, said: ‘This is a bright young man with a very
promising future in this country as an NHS doctor.

‘He has a first-class degree in biochemistry.

‘He has qualified as a doctor and completed his training.’ Islam, who wore a black jacket with a grey shirt and tie, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address and was remanded in custody  to appear at the Old Bailey on November 2.

His wife, also 26, was released without charge on Tuesday.

The would-be jihadists are said to form part of a 40-strong group of fanatics who want to convert Syria to sharia law.

British security services are trying to trace the men who allegedly flew from the UK to join the terror cell in Bab al-Hawa, an area in the north of the country close to the Turkish border.

Officials believe up to 100 British nationals have travelled to Syria to fight against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

But the group of 15, who are armed with machine guns, are understood to particularly concern British authorities because of their alleged links to Islamic fundamentalism.

Others who may have joined the Free Syrian Army, which is fighting against the Syrian government and is backed by Foreign Secretary William Hague, are of less concern to British authorities.

Analysts say the majority fighting Assad’s brutal regime are ordinary Syrians and soldiers who have defected.

But an increasing number of  foreign fighters with militant beliefs from countries including Britain and France are crossing the borders. Last week Mr Hague said the Government is monitoring evidence of Britons who want to join the conflict.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
