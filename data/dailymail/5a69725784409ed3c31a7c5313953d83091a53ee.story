A suspended Connecticut priest charged in a federal firearms and explosives case involving a teenage accomplice has been arrested on allegations he sexually assaulted a child.

The Rev. Paul Gotta was arrested Monday by East Windsor police on seven sexual assault charges stemming from encounters with a minor that took place over the span of a year beginning in January 2012.

Gotta was administrator of St. Philip and St. Catherine churches in East Windsor when the Archdiocese of Hartford suspended him last July when the sexual assault allegations surfaced.

Around the same time, he also was arrested by federal authorities on charges including illegally transferring a gun, ammunition and explosive material to a high school student.

Jury selection in that case is set to begin in May. Meanwhile, Gotta is being held on $100,000 bail. His next court appearance was scheduled for April 15.

Gotta, 55, was taken into custody Monday at his Bridgeport on two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault and five count of fourth-degree sexual assault. 

The clergyman had been on house arrest since last summer. As a condition of his release, Gotta had to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet, the station WFSB reported. 

According to federal officials, Gotta helped 18-year-old Kyle Bass acquire a handgun and thousands of rounds of ammunition. He also allegedly helped the teen manufacture a homemade pipe bomb.

Target: Bass allegedly planned to play a 'prank' at his school, the Metropolitan Learning Center in Bloomfield

Law enforcement officials first came in contact with Gotta last June, when the priest reached out to the feds to report that Bass had weapons and explosives, and that he had made disturbing comments about his school, the Metropolitan Learning Center in Bloomfield, Hartford Courant reported.

According to court documents, Gotta said Bass told him, â€˜You should bring your gun with you when you walk your dog. You never know when someone will jump out of the bushes and shoot you or the dog.â€™

However, in February, Gotta was indicted for allegedly helping Bass get his hands on firearms and bullets.

His indictment states that the 55-year-old cleric assisted Bass in buying a gun in Arizona and bringing it back to Connecticut in 2012, along with thousands of bullets.

Kyle Bass was arrested in June 2013 for allegedly making bombs he had planned to use at his school. When police searched his East Windsor home, they discovered soda bottle silencers, firearms and explosive materials.

In January, Bass pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a silencer. He faces 10 years behind bars, minus three years of suspended sentence, and three years' probation.
