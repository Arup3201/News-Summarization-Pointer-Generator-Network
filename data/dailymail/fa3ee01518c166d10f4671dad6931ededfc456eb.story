A one-year-old has been seriously injured in China after being thrown into the air by his neighbour.

Cheng Wang, 38, threw the child during an argument over a water heater in Xinji township, leaving him with multiple fractures.

The argument started when Wang caught his neighbour's nine-year-old son, Lei, throwing stones at the solar panels attached to his water heater.

A man in China has been arrested after throwing his neighbour's one-year-old into the air during a row

The argument started after Cheng Wang, 38, caught his neighbour's nine-year-old throwing stones at his water heater and went over to complain

He went over to speak with neighbour Meng Tuan, 30, but claims he was slapped, pushed and threatened by a drunk crowd before spotting the toddler

Wang went next door to confront his neighbour, Meng Tuan, 30, but found he was in the middle of a large family celebration for his brother's 40th birthday.

However the partygoers, who witnesses say had been drinking, didn't take kindly to the interruption and began insulting Wang.

They laughed at him and threatened him. He was pushed, shoved and finally slapped. Feeling cornered, Cheng ran and, in a bid to divert attention from himself, grabbed the child and threw him into the air.

As he was leaving the party Wang grabbed the boy in an attempt to divert attention from himself, he says

Meng Tuan, who was in the middle of celebrating his brother's 40th birthday at the time, could only watch in horror as his son was picked up by Wang

'We do not consider it an act of pre-meditated violence, but it was an assault,' said a police spokesman.

'This man was feeling threatened and looking for a way out. Unfortunately, the innocent baby was seriously injured as a result.'

The baby suffered multiple fractures and was taken to hospital. At first doctors feared for his life but later he was declared out of danger.

The police spokesman added that Cheng was under arrest along with the family of the baby, who are facing a probe for assault and criminal damage.

In a violent act, Wang takes hold of the boy, swings his arms backwards, then hurls the child into the air

The boy suffered fractured bones and was taken to hospital in serious condition, but his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening (pictured, the moment Wang releases the boy in midair)
