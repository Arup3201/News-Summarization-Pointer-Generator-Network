Litter, driftwood, the odd message-in-a-bottle, perhaps. But an eight foot yellow man?

A giant Lego figure was found washed up on Yuigahama beach in Kamakura,Japan earlier this week, spotted at dawn by surfer Tatsuya Hirata.

Dressed in blue trousers and red T-shirt emblazoned with the cryptic message 'No real than you are' on the front, and the name 'Ego Leonard' was written on the back.

It's not the first time the Lego figure has washed up on exotic shores. 

The oversized plastic man turned up in Zandvoort, in the Netherlands in 2007, Brighton in 2008 and Sarasota in Florida in 2011.

There is Dutch artist who works under the pseudonym of Ego Leonard, and it is thought that whoever is behind his or her artworks, has also been making the giant figures.

The Lego man has been spotted in areas currently hosting exhibits by the artist, so it's likely his appearance is part of marketing stunt.
