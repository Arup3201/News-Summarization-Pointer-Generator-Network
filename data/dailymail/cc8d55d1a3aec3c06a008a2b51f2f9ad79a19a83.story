A wealthy couple have run up a £2.7million legal bill fighting a divorce battle that a judge compared to a spat in a nursery.

Mark and Jenifer Evans were ‘penniless’ when they married in 1985. After setting up an IT firm, they earned £41million and bought homes in the UK, the US and Turks and Caicos Islands.

But since Mrs Evans, 47, a barrister, began divorce proceedings in 2010, the couple have wasted £2.7million ‘point-scoring’ before the case’s conclusion this week, Mr Justice Moylan said.

Jenifer and Mark Evans ran up legal bills of £2.7million during their three-year legal battle which Mr Justice Moylan described as 'puerile'

He awarded 45 per cent, or £18million, of their fortune to Mrs Evans, with Mr Evans receiving the remainder of £22million.

The ruling, at the Family Division of the High Court, in London, revealed that the American couple met and married when they were only 20 and 21, respectively. They set up Confluence Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,1991.

The judge said that, as the marriage was ‘unravelling,’ Mrs Evans travelled to Arizona, with their two teenage daughters to confront her husband after learning he was at a conference with his mistress. The woman later went on to become his new wife.

The couple owned a property on Montpelier Street in the Borough of Kensington, London

In retaliation, Mr Evans threatened to 
cancel Mrs Evans’ UK visa and stopped her access to some of their joint 
credit cards and bank accounts.

The ruling also revealed that Mrs Evans, 
who lives in a £10.6million apartment near Harrods in Knightsbridge, 
West London, was ‘particularly upset’ after learning her husband planned
to give her replacement engagement ring to his new wife.

In little over 12 months, between July 
2010 and August 2011, Mr Evans, 48, also spent around £130,000 on 
jewellery, handbags and clothing for his lover.

Mr Evans, who still runs Confluence Corporation, sold 65 per cent of his shares
in the firm to a venture capitalist firm for £26million.

At a previous hearing Mrs Evans was awarded £26million - half of the couple’s joint £52million wealth - by a family judge.

However, fearing that after their 
divorce her husband could legally transfer his company shares - thought 
to be worth at least £40million - to another person, thereby denying her
the full pay out, she successfully applied for a second family court 
hearing to agree a settlement.

At a hearing in July last year, Lord Justice Thorpe described their dispute as ‘puerile’, telling them: ‘Somebody has to come into the nursery to make some rules.’

He also expressed amazement at the 
‘completely disproportionate’ legal bills run up in the case, adding: ‘I
simply cannot understand how the parties can litigate with such 
profligate extravagance.’

He described their divorce proceedings as a ‘bitter forensic battle’ over their millions following their ‘traumatic’ separation in July 2010.

The divorce settlement was reached at the Family Division of the High Court where the judge described proceedings as a 'bitter forensic battle'

‘To record that this litigation has cost a total of £2.7million is, to put it mildly, a stark reflection of the extent to which this case has been contested,’ he said.

‘Each side seemed to be focused largely on forensic point scoring.’

Yesterday’s ruling effectively denied Mrs Evans around £8million awarded in the first settlement after Mr Justice Moylan estimated the couple’s total wealth had fallen to £40.7million. He also decided to downgrade her share.

However, he ordered Mr Evans, who re-married last year and lives in San Francisco, California, with his new wife who is expecting their first child, pay his ex £140,000 a year maintenance until the sale of their assets and properties when a clean break could be made.
