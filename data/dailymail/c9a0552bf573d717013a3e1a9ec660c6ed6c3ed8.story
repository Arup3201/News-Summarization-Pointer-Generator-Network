The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire died this week at the age of 94 bringing an end to the fascinating life and times of the Mitford sisters.

Deborah Vivien Cavendish and her siblings moved in the same circles as Winston Churchill, John F Kennedy, Adolf Hitler and Evelyn Waugh and epitomised a privileged and glamorous aristocratic life that no longer exists.

The six daughters - Nancy, Pam, Diana, Unity, Decca and Debo - born between 1905 and 1920 to Lord Redesdale and his wife Sydney, were the Kardashians of their day in terms of the public interest their antics aroused.

They certainly gave people something to talk about with their actions and relationships, creating more scandal than that seen in the fictional Downton Abbey. 

The most controversial of the sisters was Diana, known as Honks, who left her first husband and married the founder of the British Union of Fascists Oswald Mosley. They tied the knot in a civil ceremony in Joseph Goebbels' drawing room in Berlin in 1936. Hitler was the only other guest.

As a result, during World War Two she was locked up as an enemy to the Allies in Holloway Prison. 

Mary S. Lovell, who has written a biography on the Mitford sisters, said Diana 'became arguably the most hated woman in England for a while.'

But Diana wasn't the only Mitford with polarising political views. Decca was once an outspoken supporter of communism while Unity was also a fan of Hitler.

Both she and Diana attended the Nuremberg Nazi rally of 1933 and Unity was said to have become fascinated with the leader.

They became great friends - some even believe lovers. When war broke out, she was in Germany and shot herself in the head with a silver pistol. She survived but was brain damaged and was sent back to England to be nursed by her family. She died in 1948 of meningitis. 

Although many hated the sisters for their political alliances, others admired them for their wit and beauty.

They also had a brother, Tom, who died during World War Two in Burma. 

The girls were raised in stately homes in relative isolation as their father didn't believe they should go to school to be educated. 

Despite this, they became prolific writers, the most successful being Nancy who wrote entertaining stories with outlandish characters based on her own family. 

The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate were her most popular novels and their appeal endures today.

As a writer with an affluent background, Nancy was a natural fit with the 'Bright Young Things' - the name given to the group of young aristocrats and socialites in 1920s, including Evelyn Waugh, who raised eyebrows with their partying.

Another famous associate of the Mitford sisters was Winston Churchill. In 1937 Decca, then 19, met her second cousin Esmond Romilly, Churchill's nephew. They eloped to Spain during the civil war causing the British government to send a war ship to the country to try and bring them home.

Legacy: The Dowager devoted her life to running the Chatsworth estate

They then moved to America where Decca remained until her death in 1996 but she had by then long lost her first husband who was killed in action during World War Two. 

Pamela, the second eldest daughter, led the quietest life and was described as 'the most rural of the Mitfords' as she was more content on a farm than at at cocktail parties and balls.

The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire also led a less scandalous life but still made her mark on history.  

She married Andrew Cavendish, who succeeded his father as 11th Duke of Devonshire in 1950, and devoted her life to running the Chatsworth estate with her husband.

While many other stately homes have fallen into disrepair, the Derbyshire house remains not only a home but a successful business as a popular tourist attraction which is testament to the Dowager's efforts. 

The Dowager was the last of the surviving Mitford sisters but their legacy remains in their works of literature and at Chatsworth.   

In her book, 'The Mitford Girls: The Biography of an Extraordinary Family' Mary S. Lovell sums up why the girls were so intriguing in their day - and remain so after their deaths.

'These six girls, brought up in exactly the same way yet developing in such an individual manner, seem to have taken the twentieth century by the throat,' she writes. 

'It is not so much that they were historically important - but that they were so much larger than life - easily as interesting as the characters's in Nancy's novels.'
