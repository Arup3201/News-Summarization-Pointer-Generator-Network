Dozens of top military generals are living like kings in government-supplied villas - many costing taxpayers more than $100,000 a year - while the rank-and-file in the military struggle through billions spending cuts, a new report reveals.

A secret Pentagon report scrutinized 32 mansions owned or rented by the military for its top brass and found that many are too costly and too lavish - even by the generous standards of the Pentagon. 

It is estimated that the Defense Department owns or rents hundreds more such homes for its top officers. Many of them are in exotic locales like Brussels, Belgium, and Naples, Italy, where its officers are posted.

Many of the mansions are outfitted with professional chefs and gardeners. All of them have costly security measures like armed guards, gates, blast walls and blast-proof windows.

Posh: The home of General John F Kelly in Coral Gables, Florida, costs taxpayers $160,000 a year in rent and another $402,000 this year in renovations

U.S. Marine General John Kelly, 62, will take up residence in October in the posh home - one of hundreds of luxury accommodations owned or leased by the military

The Los Angeles Times reports that Marine General John F. Kelly, the commander of all U.S. forces in Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America, lives in a mansion called Casa Sur in Coral Gables, Florida, that costs $160,000 a year in rent.

Taxpayers have spent an estimated $402,000 in security improvements and renovations that are currently underway.

When work is finished, the upgrades will include a professional kitchen, two new bathrooms, a redone master bedroom, blast-resistant windows and a vehicle barrier.

The Pentagon says the age-old practice of billeting generals and 
admirals in top accommodations is necessary. Generals move frequently 
and it would be inefficient and impractical for them to find new housing
at every new posting.

Additionally, any accommodation for a top general must include secure internet and phone lines, as well as security measures to protect the high-value officers.

Top generals and admirals need professional chefs and gardeners because they must frequently entertain visiting state guests in their official capacity at their homes.

Still the Defense Department is in the grips of a dealing with emergency spending cuts from the multibillion-dollar sequester deal.

Sharing the pain? The pool at the Officers Club at Fort Myer, Virginia, - home to most of the top military brass - is now closed once a week as a result of sequester cuts

The Pentagon has been forced to reduce services, cut training and missions, and furlough 680,000 civilian employees - costing them 20percent of their salaries.

The pain appears to have trickled up to top officers only a little.

A spokeswoman for Fort Myer, the Virginia military base that houses most of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their deputies, told the Los Angeles Times that the pool at the  Ft. Myer Officers Club was forced to cancel swim lessons on Tuesdays because it has to close for one day a week. 

Air Force General Philip M. Breedlove, the commander of NATO, lives in a military-supplied 15,000-square-foot chateau in Belgium that dates to the 1800s.

Admiral Bruce W. Clingan, the commander of U.S. Navy forces in Europe, has an official residence in Naples, Italy, that costs taxpayers $220,000 a year in maintenance

Lieutenant General Steven A. Hummer, the head of Marine Forces Reserve, resides in a 19th century plantation home listed on the National Register of Historic Places in New Orleans. 

Rear Admiral Robert Burke, who commands the submarine group that patrols the Mediterranean Sea, calls home to Villa de Lorio in Naples, Italy - a 6,600-square-foot mansion that costs taxpayers $172,000 a year in rent. 

His boss, Admiral Bruce W. Clingan lives in 12,000-square-feet of luxury in Villa Nike nearby. The mansion - which the Navy owns - has been costing taxpayers $220,000 a year in maintenance costs and needs $3million more in repairs. 

All of the top officers who work at the Pentagon enjoy billeting in historic housing in the Washington D.C. area - with the size and grandeur of the home commensurate to the rank and standing of the office.

The chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert lives in Tingey House, a Georgian-style brick mansion at the Navy Yard.

Marine Corps Commandant's General James F. Amos lives in a 213 home on Capitol Hill.

Top U.S. Army brass and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey reside on 'Generals Row' - nine stately brick mansions at Fort Myer in Washington.
