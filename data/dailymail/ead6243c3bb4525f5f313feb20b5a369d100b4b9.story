Sergiy Stakhovsky has done it again. A year after dumping Roger Federer out of the second round at Wimbledon he sent Ernests Gulbis packing at the same stage.

The world No 86 perhaps thought a posting on court 12 might keep him below the radar. But matches involving Gulbis are rarely quiet. And upsetting the 12th seed ensures he will inflate his reputation so long as he keeps his footing on grass.

This was a performance of domination, a sustained beating that rarely, if ever, looked like letting up. He ultimately saw off the Latvian 6-4, 6-3, 7-6.

Winner: Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine is through to the third round of Wimbledon after beating Ernests Gulbis

Defeated: The Latvian reached the semi-finals of the French Open two weeks ago

It was impressive, but also a combustion of sorts from Gulbis, a man as volatile as he is gifted.

The key moment came in the second set when, having already lost the first, Gulbis staved off a host of break points at 3-3. But he finally cracked, two straight double faults giving Stakhovsky the edge.

‘What is wrong with my serve?’ Gulbis shouted. 

It became a theme, until he later directed his self criticism at his handling of spin.

It
 was that sort of match for the French Open semi-finalist, but 
Stakhovsky did not get distracted by the histrionics and closed out the 
third-set tie break 7-5 for another impressive win.

Throwback: Stakhovsky celebrating his victory over Roger Federer at Wimbledon last year

Shock result: The Swiss legend was the reigning champion at the time
