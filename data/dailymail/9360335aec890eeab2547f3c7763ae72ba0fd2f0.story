A pensioner bled to death over the course of two hours in hospital after his drip became detached from his hand, an inquest heard yesterday.

James Bent, 86, was placed on an antibiotic drip after being admitted to hospital with numerous health complaints including diarrhoea, heart disease, pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.

But two hours later he was found collapsed in bed with a pool of blood on the floor after the drip tube feeding him the antibiotics became detached from the cannula - the plastic piece of apparatus connecting the tube to the vein - causing his blood to flow out of the opening.

Staff at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester immediately stopped the bleeding but Mr Bent went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated.

The inquest in Bolton heard that bachelor Mr Bent, from Leigh, was admitted to the hospital on
January 28 suffering from diarrhoea and was place in a 
single room to prevent any infection from spreading.

Mr Bent also had several pre-existing medical conditions, including heart disease plus 
pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver thought to have been the result 
of the weekly bottle of rum added to his coffee.

On the night before he died, Staff nurse Catherine Maher said Mr Bent was struggling to sleep, pressing his call button every half hour.

She said: 'He was frustrated and irritated. He couldn’t sleep and was angry about being in a side ward.'

She last checked on Mr Bent at 6.35am on February 17 when she set up a new antibiotic drip, handing over to the day shift at 7.30am.

But when Health care assistant Rose Nuttall went to ask Mr Bent what he wanted for breakfast at around 8.35am, she discovered him collapsed in his bed with a pool of blood on the floor.

She called for help and nurses put a stop to the bleeding.

Susan Fearon, acting sister on the ward, was one of the first into Mr Bent’s room after Mrs Nuttall found him.

'It was quite a shock. The fact that was
quite distressing to us was the gentleman was awake and looking at us 
and in reach of his buzzer,' she said.

While Mr Bent was left unsupervised for two hours, the inquest was told that patients with cannulas are usually only observed every four hours.

The court heard how the drip tube was connected to the cannula’s three way tap by a single threaded screw which could easily be undone.

Deputy coroner Alan Walsh ruled that Mr Bent would not have deliberately tried to harm himself but added that he did not believe the drip had been incorrectly set up.

Giving a narrative verdict, Mr Walsh said that Mr Bent 'died as a consequence of the accidental detachment of a giving set (drip tube apparatus) used to administer intravenous antibiotics from a three way tap connected to a cannula inserted into an arm vein against a background of naturally occurring and alcohol related disease.'

Speaking after the hearing Mr Bent’s nephew, Ken Atherton, said he accepted the coroner’s finding but was critical of the way his uncle was treated at the hospital before his death.

He stressed that the pensioner, who had been a vegan since his early 20s and taught himself several languages,  lost a lot of weight as a result of his false teeth being lost just hours after his admission and claimed that requests for his food to be liquidized were ignored.
