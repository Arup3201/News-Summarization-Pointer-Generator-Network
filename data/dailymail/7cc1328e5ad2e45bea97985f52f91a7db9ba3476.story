Britain basked in a swathe of sunshine today as temperatures hit double figures and even dogs donned sunglasses.

As the mercury hit 11C in parts of the north west and mid Wales, Brits were out in force enjoying the warm wintry weather on the south coast.

And, while forecasters said temperatures will dip towards the end of the week, it is set to be a fine and dry half-term for most of the country.

However, from tomorrow, Britain will again be blighted by biting winds and frost, with an increasing chance of snow as icy gusts blow in from Scandinavia.

After the glorious weekend weather continued into yesterday, when much of the country was in sunshine, the mercury will plunge back towards freezing.

By Thursday, temperature highs will fall significantly below average to just 4C, and will stay there throughout the weekend. Night time temperatures will fall as low as -4C.

Forecasters say that parts of the east coast will be hit by snowÂ  flurries that will blow in over the North Sea.

John Lee, of MeteoGroup, said: 'There's only a risk of wintery flurries along the eastern side of England, where it will be windy and the temperature will be low.'

But there is at least one more day of the good weather to enjoy.

Today most of the country had dry and sunny conditions with 9C in the North and 11C in the South.

The
Met Office said today's temperatures reached up to 8C at the tip of 
Cornwall with around 6C in western coastal areas.

Temperatures
will hover around freezing across most of the South tonight. While 
winds are expected to reach speeds of 25mph in South Western areas 
making it feel even colder.
