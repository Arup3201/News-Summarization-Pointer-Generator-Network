A 24-year-old woman can never take a nap on a whim, because a rare disease means falling asleep unexpectedly would kill her.

Emma Chell is the second oldest woman in the UK living with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.

Sufferers of the condition simply forget to breathe whenever they fall asleep due to a fault in the neurological reflex that controls breathing and there is nothing they can do about it.

Sleeping soundly: Emma Chell, pictured with boyfriend Chris, must spend each night on a ventilator

Living with the condition means that Emma has never fallen asleep at her desk, had a childhood sleepover or nodded off on a train.

The only way she can sleep at all is by using a special mask ventilator which breathes for her while she sleeps.

She said: 'It's become a subconscious thing now because I have had the condition my whole life.

'I know I can never just nod off somewhere because I will die. If I get sleepy during the day, I just walk around and try to shake it off.

'Making sure I get a good night's sleep is really important and I don't drink apart from the odd glass as long as my mum and dad are with me because I'm scared of getting drunk and maybe passing out.'

Emma spent the first two years of her life in hospital while doctors attempted to work out why she would suddenly stop breathing.

Only 1 in 200,000 children are born with the condition but only around 200 people in the world currently live with it as the mortality rate is so high. Emma is one of just 30 CCHS sufferers in the UK.

Also known as Ondine's curse, the condition is named after the myth of a water nymph who had an unfaithful mortal lover who swore to her that his 'every waking breath would be a testimony of his love'. Upon witnessing his adultery, she cursed that if he should fall asleep, he would forget to breathe.

Speaking from the family home in Cheadle, Staffordshire, Emma's mother and full-time carer Carole, 51, said: 'My pregnancy with Emma had been completely normal right up until the moment she was born.

'She immediately turned blue and was whisked away to the neo-natal unit. At first, the doctors just wanted to monitor her but they found that every time she went to sleep she would stop breathing, her oxygen levels would drop and they would have to wake her up again.

'But they could only do that for so long as she was getting so tired and eventually they put her on a ventilator.

'None of the doctors or nurses had ever seen anything like it before. The consultant ended up ringing every children's unit in the country in search of answers.'

Determined: Emma says she wants to live as normal a life as possible

Eventually, Prof Peter Fleming, professor of paediatrics at Bristol Children's Hospital diagnosed Emma with one of the UK's first cases of CCHS.

She had a tracheostomy operation to insert a breathing tube into her neck, but doctors were still too afraid to allow her to go home with her parents.

It wasn't until she was two years old that she was allowed home for a few hours a day.

Eventually, Carole and her husband David, 56, a welder, were trained to use the ventilation machine and oxygen monitors which allowed Emma to sleep.

Carole said: 'With the condition being so rare, the doctors didn't know what to expect or what her life expectancy might be. She was being ventilated nearly 24 hours a day so there was no way she could come home.

'The first night she came home was Christmas Eve and we just sat with her all night long. Both of us were too terrified to go to sleep in case something happened.

'After that, I would go to bed for half the night and David would watch her, then I would get up and let him get a few hours sleep.

'We were always tired but we had to do it for our peace of mind. Nowadays, people with CCHS have nurses seven nights a week, but for ten years we were completely on our own.

'There were a lot of scares. One time she caught the measles and clinically died in hospital. Measles is dangerous for anyone but with CCHS children it severely affects their breathing and they had to bring in a crash team to revive her.'

Emma's parents were woken between 50-60 times a night by the various alarms rigged to her bedtime breathing equipment.

And when Emma started school, she had to have an adult accompany her at all times, making it difficult for her to fit in and make friends.

Then, last year, Emma was struck down with Meningitis C which almost proved fatal. She spent ten days in hospital recovering, during four of which she was in a coma.

Once again she had amazed doctors with her incredible survival, even after her heart stopped and they were once again forced to revive her.

Now, after completing a course in computing at her local college, Emma is eager to get on with her life.

She spends most nights with her van-driver boyfriend Chris Mason, 29, who has had to adapt to spending his nights with a masked bedfellow.

Emma said: 'Growing up was very isolating. I'd spent the first two years of my life in hospital and I wasn't able to make any sounds at all until I was 18 months old because of the traceostomy.

'Then, having an adult around all the time at school made it difficult to fit in. They even used to follow me to the toilet because the school insisted I needed supervision "just in case" "It was only when I started college at 18 that things started to improve.

'All my life I had been told I couldn't do things in case something happened, but now I want to get out there and get a job and start living my life like everyone else.

'I do feel a certain duty as one of the oldest sufferers of CCHS to show that it is possible to live a normal life and that they shouldn't be afraid of the future.'
