Ed Miliband this morning flatly rejected David Cameron’s proposal to block Scottish MPs voting on English laws.

The Labour leader said he was open to English-only ‘scrutiny’ of new laws – but insisted he did not want the House of Commons split into different classes of MPs.

His position threatens to torpedo the rapid timetable agreed by David Cameron to transfer sweeping new powers to Scotland following last week’s independence referendum.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said blocking Scottish MPs from voting on English issues would create two classes of MPs

Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of using the Scottish referendum to play politics against the Labour party

Mr Miliband also risks a mutiny among his own MPs, many of whom back ‘English votes for English laws’ over fears the party risks being seen as ‘anti English’.

But the Labour leader accused Mr Cameron of using the constitutional crisis sparked by the Scottish referendum to play politics.

He said he did not support the idea of an ‘English parliament’ because it meant a ‘new tier of politicians’.

He said: ‘I am in favour of one House of Commons with 650 MPs because, goodness, we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our Parliament being split up and our United Kingdom being split up and I want to make sure that doesn’t happen.’

Mr Miliband added: 'I’m not in favour of a House of Commons that becomes divided. So that somehow the House of Commons chamber is no longer 650 MPs – you’ve got to have one Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.'

He insisted he was not against any reform. He said: ‘I’m not against the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation that particularly affects England by English MPs.’

But he said: ‘We can’t do it in a back-of-the-envelope, fag packet way. Let’s have a proper constitutional convention.

‘Let’s not drive our country apart because David Cameron believes it is an opportunity for him to do it. Let’s keep out country together.’

Mr Miliband claimed Mr Cameron was ‘learning the wrong lessons’ from the Scottish referendum.

He said: ‘I think constitutional change is important but I think I think there’s a much bigger lesson – it’s the economy stupid. Forty five per cent of people tried to break up our country by voting ‘Yes’. 

Mr Miliband traveled to the BBC studios at Media City in Salford this morning for the Andrew Marr show

‘They thought they had nothing to lose, many of them, by saying let’s leave the United Kingdom. Does this country work for an elite few or does it work for most working people?’

He said the vote was a ‘wake-up call’ for the political establishment.

The Labour leader said: ‘People right across the United Kingdom will say, David Cameron made a promise – and he’s going to be kept to that. I know David Cameron will want to honour that promise.

‘Trust in politics is sufficiently low that we’ve got to keep our promises.’

He said: ‘We’ve got to look at all the constitutional issues that have been thrown up. There is a big problem, which is power has been devolved in Scotland, power has been devolved in Wales but governments of both parties have failed to devolve power in England.

‘Now the first answer to that question is not to change the nature of the centralised power of Westminster over England, it is to devolve power in England. And that is absolutely crucial.’

He added: ‘There isn’t a simple answer to this question. We’ve been wrestling with this issue for 120 years. Ever since we were talking about Irish Home Rule.’

Mr Cameron has insisted his plan to link further Scottish devolution to the process of making sure only English MPs can vote on English laws is necessary to address a ‘basic unfairness’ in the constitution.

He called on Mr Miliband to either work together with him or explain to the people of the UK why he would not tackle the ‘fundamentally unjust’ situation which means Scottish MPs can vote on laws which do not apply to their constituents.

The move came after former prime minister Gordon Brown insisted he would make sure Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg stick to the proposed timetable for setting out future powers for Scotland. Mr Cameron's insistence that the new settlement for Holyrood should go hand in hand with efforts to answer the so-called West Lothian question about the rights of Scottish and English MPs at Westminster has been met with wariness from Labour, which has most of Scotland's 59 seats, although Mr Miliband has insisted the party will ensure that the timetable for further devolution will not slip.

But Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg warned that Mr Cameron's decision to link the issues could see him forced to renege on his promise to the people of Scotland.

The cross-party consensus forged between the three leaders has shattered following Mr Cameron's announcement, which came shortly after Scottish voters rejected independence by 55 per cent to 45 per cent.

Mr Cameron insisted the timetable setting out the next stages of the devolution process would be met: ‘New powers over tax, spending and welfare are on their way to Scotland.

‘The timetable is brisk, but achievable: a White Paper by November, and draft legislation published by January. It would have to be passed in the next Parliament.’

But writing in the Mail on Sunday he added: ‘This moment must not just be about securing Scotland's future in the UK - and celebrating that fact - but settling other questions whose time has come.

‘The challenge is to make sure our UK works for all nations.

‘Millions of people in the rest of the UK have been listening to these debates, watching this campaign and rightly asking: 'What will change for us? Why can't we have the same powers and the same rights as those in Scotland?'

‘These are questions the Conservative Party itself has been asking for a long time.

‘Why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on what is taught in English schools, to reduce spending on English hospitals, or even vary English or Welsh income taxes, when under the new settlement English or Welsh MPs would have no say in such matters in Scotland?

‘It is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of England and Wales overridden in this way.’

David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg made 'a vow' to the Scottish people to transfer new powers to Edinburgh

He added: ‘If the Scottish Parliament will soon have a range of new powers: powers over income tax rates; to change benefits such as housing benefit; to increase spending, including on the NHS – then there is a crying need to reflect that across the UK.

But Mr Clegg, writing in The Sunday Times, insisted there could be ‘no ifs, no buts’ about delivering the extra powers promised to Scotland, and the package ‘cannot be made contingent on other constitutional reforms’.

He accused the Tories of being more concerned with the threat from Ukip than the vow made to Scotland.

He said: ‘The Conservatives, in their rush to protect themselves from an attack from the right, are only concerned about English votes on English matters.

‘Of course we need a solution to this dilemma but, by appearing to link it to the delivery of further devolution to Scotland, they risk reneging on the commitment made to the Scottish people that, in the event of a No vote, new powers would come what may.

‘Worse still, if the Conservatives enter into a Dutch auction with Ukip over ever more extreme solutions to the issue of English votes they could jeopardise the union they purport to defend.

‘Surely we haven't fought to save our union in a vote north of the border, only to see it balkanised in Westminster?’

The Prime Minister has reportedly invited a group of senior Tories to Chequers tomorrow to discuss his plans.

Former environment secretary Owen Paterson accused Mr Cameron of ‘panicky and ill-considered bargaining’ over the offer of further powers to Holyrood.

He told The Sunday Times it was ‘disgraceful’ that the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland had not been consulted.

Former premier Mr Brown, who has been credited with helping to save the union following his interventions to boost the No campaign, insisted the timetable for setting out the devolution plans would be met.
