Freddie Starr yesterday denied being the ‘third man’ abusing schoolgirls in Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room with Gary Glitter.

His extraordinary statement came 24 hours after a High Court battle in which he lost an injunction granted to prevent publication of a libellous allegation.

No details of the allegation had been revealed but Mr Starr, 69, yesterday chose to make clear that he was falsely being linked to the sex scandal surrounding Savile.

Mr Starr said
he was responding to claims made by Karin Ward, who told an ITV 
documentary she saw Glitter raping a girl of 13 in Savile’s BBC dressing
room in the 1970s.

Miss Ward, who was 14 at the time, 
also claims Savile had his hand up a third girl’s skirt and that, on a 
separate occasion, she was groped by a drunken Starr in Savile’s 
dressing room.

She initially made her claims to 
BBC’s Newsnight last year but the documentary was shelved. In the ITV 
documentary, Miss Ward only mentioned Glitter and Savile.

The comic, who lives in Studley, 
Warwickshire, said he hadn’t even met the girl who accused him of 
drunkenly molesting her at the bash and went on to brand Savile - whom 
he claims to have only met twice - as a ‘phoney’ and a ‘boring, boring 
man’.

Describing the moment he found out 
about the allegations, comedian Starr said: ‘The first we heard of all 
this was when Dean, my lawyer, called us up yesterday after getting an 
email from ITV.

‘He was panicking, because he’s my mate as well as my QC. He said it was alleged I was in a room with Jimmy Savile, and these two alleged 14-year-old girls.

‘I’ve only met Jimmy Savile maybe twice. He came to see me with his mother at one of my shows. I always thought he was a flash b*****d, but I wanted to meet him before I cast aspersions on his character.

‘He said to me: “Now then young man, I’ve brought the duchess to meet you” - that was his mother. They stayed for 15 or 20 minutes before he left me so I had time to plan what I was going to do in the show.

‘The other time was when he came into
mine and my partner’s men’s clothing shop in Leeds. We were sat in the 
shop and he walked past, looked in and came in.

‘In he comes and he starts to show us 
his bus pass. We just sat there taking the p***. We said: "Surely you 
have enough money, you’ve got a roller."

‘He
sat in his normal pose in the chair, taking up all the chair. I asked 
him if he wanted a drink, he said he just wanted a cup of tea, and he 
used all of those sayings he had off TV when he was talking to you.

Claims: Gary Glitter, pictured in 1991, also allegedly had sex with another under-age girl at the party

‘He demeaned you, by talking a bit 
down to you. I couldn’t wait to get him out of the shop. He was a 
boring, boring man. I used to see him on television, and I always 
thought to myself: “You’re phoney - there’s something not right about 
you”.

‘I feel deeply sorry for them (his 
alleged victims) for having to go through what that scumbag put them 
through, I really do care for them.

'Don’t f******g tar me with the same brush as Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter. If there is one thing I’ve always hated it’s paedophiles'

Freddie Starr

‘But don’t f******g tar me with the same
brush as Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter. If there is one thing I’ve 
always hated it’s paedophiles. If I see something on the TV about a kid 
getting hurt, I just have to turn it off.

‘I can’t stand that sort of bloke. I’ve always been against paedophiles and always will be. I’ve never touched any under-aged girl in my life. Paedophiles are a pet hate of mine, so I refute it completely.’

Starr denied he was at any party with Savile.

He added: ‘She’s claiming I made advances to her, it didn’t happen. She says she rebuffed me because my breath smelled of alcohol.

‘Well that can’t have happened 
because I’ve never drunk, I’m teetotal. I have never been in any 
situation with Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter, and I have certainly never
been with this woman.

'When I read that I had made advances towards this woman - that never happened'

Freddie Starr

‘A mate of mine has said it wasn’t only Jimmy Savile who did this, there’s more to come out, but I don’t know more details. But when I read that I had made advances towards this woman - that never happened.

‘It could have been some other poor 
b*****d, it’s horrible to be faced with this. I think there are more to 
come forward - and I think there should be a police investigation into 
it now.’

The 68-year-old - engaged to Sophie 
Lea, 34, who fell pregnant with his fifth child last November - spoke 
out after losing an injunction to prevent the press from printing the 
shocking claims.

His 
comments came as it emerged police child abuse officers have met with 
BBC officials to discuss the allegations made against late television 
presenter Sir Jimmy Savile.

A
Met Police spokesman said tonight that officers were contacting all 
individuals who have made claims about Savile, and hoped to have a 
'clear picture' of how many woman may have suffered abuse by next week.

Speaking from his five-bedroom home, 
Starr went on to say that he had only met Gary Glitter once at an 
England football match - where he contemplated stealing the rock 
singer’s wig.

'It could have been some other poor b*****d, it’s horrible to be faced with this. I think there are more to come forward - and I think there should be a police investigation into it now'

Freddie Starr

He added: ‘I was only in the same room as him at an England game in the Eighties against Greece.

‘I was there with (publicist) Max Clifford and he was sat in front of me. At half time he got up and Max said to me "that’s a wig he’s wearing". He came over and said hello, then went back to his seat, and all I wanted to do was flip off that wig.

‘I had visions of it being thrown around the crowd. I was right on the brink of doing it when Max said "No, don’t do that”.

‘Years later it came out what kind of man he was. But I had no part in the lives of Gary Glitter and Jimmy Savile, none at all.’
