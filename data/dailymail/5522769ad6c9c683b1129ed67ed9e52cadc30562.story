Southampton are ready to firm up their interest in Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster.

Saints manager Ronald Koeman has been in pursuit of Cardiff and Scotland No1 David Marshall but appears to have been scared off by the £8million price tag.

Atletico Madrid and Benfica have also been on the trail of Forster, who travelled with England to the World Cup as third choice keeper behind Joe Hart and Ben Foster.

Statistics based on league appearances

Forster has made himself and firm favourite with Celtic fans since arriving from Newcastle and is seen as one of the biggest assets at Celtic Park.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila meanwhile has warned that his transfer wish list will become irrelevant if his side miss out on the Champions League group stages.

Celtic are in action tonight against Reykjavik at Murrayfield and are already 1-0 up from the first leg.

However, Deila said: ‘Qualifying for the Champions League is very important when it comes to attracting players. that’s a huge thing and a big target for us.’
