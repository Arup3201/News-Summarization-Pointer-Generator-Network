As Chicago thaws out from a long and brutal winter, experts have warned that the warmer weather could bring with it a boom in the rat population.

Drivers could have been forgiven for thinking they would not have to deal with an increasing rodent infestation on the road.

However a video has filmed a rat so big that it stopped traffic as it made a dash across four lanes of busy traffic in Chicago, Illinois.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The video follows the huge rat as it tentatively wanders along the kerb before darting out into the road

On a busy road in Chicago, Illinois, the hilarious clip catches a gigantic rat stopping cars dead in their tracks, even forcing four to swerve out the way, as it ambles across four lanes of traffic, paying no mind to the oncoming vehicles.

The group of girls filming the video can be heard laughing hysterically in the background.

Mimicking a driver of one of the cars forced to take evasive action, one of the girls says: 'He's like someone move this dog'.

Several cars have to take evasive action to avoid the rodent as it blazes its trail across the four lanes

Miraculously, the rat manages to make it safely to the other side without being injured, let alone killed

Commenting on its size, she says: 'Oh my God, it's the biggest rat I've ever seen.'

Chicago is known to have a rat problem and, as ABC reports, this will only worsen as the weather improves.
