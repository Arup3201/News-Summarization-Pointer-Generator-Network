The finances of Labour MP Keith Vaz were investigated in 2000 and 2001

Keith Vaz could face a Commons investigation over the revelation that he held almost £500,000 in mystery bank accounts.

Scotland Yard detectives found the money during a secret investigation and regarded it as being of a ‘suspicious nature’.

Now the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has received a complaint about the former Labour minister, who denies wrongdoing.

He has not faced any criminal charges over the money, which was deposited between 1997 and 2001.

But the claims are a major embarrassment to the Labour MP on the second day of his party’s conference in Manchester.

As chairman of the home affairs select committee, Mr Vaz holds police to account on operational matters and was scathing in his criticism of Scotland Yard over the phone hacking affair.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Vaz had questions to answer.

‘I feel that he cannot continue to hold his role with the home affairs select committee during an investigation and call on him to stand down,’ Mr Bridgen added.

Mr Vaz and his wife Maria Fernandes held seven bank accounts which were probed by Scotland Yard.

There is no suggestion Miss Fernandes did anything wrong.

In 2000, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards launched an inquiry into Mr Vaz over allegations he received money from businessmen in his Leicester constituency.

The following year he was investigated for allegedly helping the billionaire Indian Hinduja brothers to obtain British passports.

During quarter of century in parliament, Keith Vaz has never been far from the headlines.Born in 1956 in Aden Colony, a British colony now part of Yemen, he moved to Britain with his parents in 1965.

He studied law Cambridge University and became a solicitor before becoming the youngest Labour MP in 1987 when he won the Leicester East seat.

In 1999 he became the first Asian minister in the Commons when Tony Blair gave him a job in the  Lord Chancellor’s Department before being promoted to the Foreign Office as Europe Minister.

In January 2001 it emerged he had contacted the Home Office about the progress of the passport applications of business tycoons Gopichand and Srichand Hinduja.

The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, launched an investigation into whether Mr Vaz had received any money from the Hinduja brothers.

The brothers had given £1,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company run by Mr Vaz’s wife, but he insisted he had not benefited personally.

He left the government in June 2001, citing health reasons.

Ms Filkin later cleared Mr Vaz of not registering the money received by his wife’s company but he was accused of failing to comply with the inquiry.

In 2002 he was suspended from the House of Commons after falslely claiming a former policewoman, a friend of Mrs Vaz’s former personal assistant, had made intimidating phonecall to his mother.

In further controversy it emerged he helped Nadhmi Auchi, an Anglo-Iraqi billionaire, in trying to avoid extradition to France.

Despite his reputation having been seemingly tarnished, he bounced back and was appointed chairman of the home affairs select committee in 2007.

When the following year the Labour government wanted to introduce 42-days detention without charge, Mr Vaz was initially against the idea but later supported it.

A leaked letter from chief whip Geoff Hoon thanked him for his support, adding: ‘I trust that it will be appropriately rewarded!’

A formidable networker, he has hosted a string of celebrities at the Houses of Parliament, dancing with Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty and taking evidence from Russell Brand, Mitch Winehouse and Cherie Blair.

Mr Vaz was cleared of receiving 
illicit funds but was forced to resign as a minister for obstructing the
inquiry and failing to provide information relating to his finances.

He was also suspended from 
Parliament. Following the inquiry, a report on Mr Vaz was sent to the 
National Intelligence Criminal Service.

The Daily Telegraph says it has seen a
Scotland Yard document showing that the NICS stated: ‘News reports have
linked Vaz to the Hinduja brothers’ passport application affair and 
imply that he may have received payments.

‘Investigations into credits in 1998 
show in excess of £58k was paid into the savings account and over £24k 
into the current account.

‘These payments contain significant amounts of cash and do not appear to be salary payments.

‘In view of the allegations against 
Vaz and reports that he did not fully comply with the Standards 
Commissioner when questioned during the inquiry, we believe that the 
level of funds received during 1998 are of a suspicious nature.

‘There are numerous unexplained 
payments into the accounts and large transfers between accounts that 
require further investigation.’ 

Scotland Yard said at least one 
payment was made into a personal HSBC account from Mapesbury 
Communications Ltd, a firm run by Mr Vaz’s wife. 

Last night Mr Vaz said: ‘The 
Telegraph contacted me on Sunday about an investigation which may or may
not have occurred ten years ago.

'I asked them to supply me with a copy 
of the report but they did  not have one.

‘These matters relate to two 
parliamentary inquiries which began in 1999 and concluded in 2003.

'My 
finances were discussed by every newspaper in the country for a period 
of three years and were the subject of extensive examination.

'I have had
no outside interests.

‘The Telegraph claim the unnamed police officer states that the payments into my account were suspicious.

'They were not suspicious in any way.
They relate to the sale of a family home in London, the purchase of a 
new family home and a drawdown of equity from my bank.

'When you sell a house and you buy a 
new house it is normal practice for the money to be paid into your 
account and the money then paid out.’

Scotland Yard refused to comment on the leaked documents.

A spokesman for John Lyon, the 
Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, said he is considering a complaint
on the issue and a decision on whether he will launch a probe is 
expected by the end of the week.

Four months ago one of Mr Vaz’s former friends was booted out of the legal profession and ordered to pay £1.4million in costs.

Shahrokh Mireskandari, 51, had faked 
his legal qualifications and hid his criminal convictions while 
representing celebrity clients.

The conman was found guilty of a 104 
breaches of the rules governing solicitors’ conduct by a disciplinary 
tribunal.

The tribunal hearing took place after
a Mail investigation revealed Mireskandari lavished hospitality on Mr 
Vaz, who publicly described him as a ‘very, very dear friend’ and also 
as the ‘best lawyer in Britain’.

As chairman of the home affairs select committee Mr Vaz is one of the most high profile Labour backbenchers. Yesterday Ed Miliband praised him from the conference platform for his 25 years in Parliament
