High-class escort and mother-of-two Samantha X has scored the role as sex editor of Penthouse magazine to make Australian men the best lovers in the world.

The Sydney-based mother, whose real name is Amanda Goff, published a tell-all book last year revealing her double life  as a $5,000 a night sex worker one week, and in her children’s tuck shop the next. 

The 40-year-old is open about her controversial career with her two children - aged six and eight - and now wants to use her years of experience with wealthy clients to offer tips in her column to guys on how to spice up their sex lives.

However, now that her book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, has taken off and a second one is in the pipeline, Ms X plans to stop earning the big bucks as an escort and concentrate on her writing career.

High-class escort and mother-of-two Samantha X has scored the role as sex editor of Penthouse magazine to make Australian men the best lovers in the world

Ms X said Australian men need to sharpen up their act in the bedroom.

'I have heard so many men complain their sex lives are non-existent and blame the wife but the key to good sex is communication,' she told Daily Mail Australa.

'Women love sex just as much as men. You don’t need to be Italian to be romantic, or French to be sexy, but you can take home a few tips from our European counterparts and become the best lovers in the world.'

Last year after the release of her book,  Samantha defended her decision to open up about her job as a high-class escort and said her work is empowering for women.

She said going public about her career and making her children vulnerable to school yard bullying was no different to children of gay parents who faced the same hardships.

'Children are teased mercilessly every day and their mother does not have to be working in the sex industry,' the 40-year-old said.

'I think the world is changing. My kids are in classes with kids that have gay parents, lesbian mothers, they’re not ridiculed.'

Five months on, Ms X insists her children have not been ridiculed once for their mother's salacious career.

'Some teachers call out across the school yard "I read your book and loved it",' she said.

'I'm sure some parents think I'm terrible Muriel but they are smart enough not to say it my face.'

In a deliberate plan to eventually stop working as an escort altogether, Samantha had to think twice about when the she last saw a client - and has even sold her apartment in the city as she now only takes occasional work outside of New South Wales.

'Within a year I won't be working as an escort anymore,' she said. 

'I'm aware the my kids are getting older and while I'm not ashamed - the plan has always been to stop it was just a case of when.'

The high-class escort, who goes by the name of Samantha X, was a former journalist who worked for New Idea and InStyle

She spends one week as a full-time mother and the next at a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD as Samantha X

She talked candidly about her profession as a sex worker to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, on Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

Samantha told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living. 

A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life.

'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules.

'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said.

'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight.

'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.'

Ms X has hit back at criticism of her parenting skills after she publicly announced she works both as an escort and in her children's school canteen

The 40-year-old believes her decision to come out as an escort was not a 'big bloody deal' when it came to affecting her children

The mother-of-two charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her time

She has worked as a journalist at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines, but now she charges $800 an hour for her services or $5,000 for an entire night.

Samantha spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with her former partner - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X.

'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff said.

Samantha said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex.

'I haven’t had sex for ages actually... I’m like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday.

'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I’ve wiped away a lot of tears. They’re paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them.

'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea.

'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we’re not hurting anyone.'

Ms X (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort

The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel

Ms X (left in 2010 and pictured right in the front row, far right in 2009) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive

The escort recalled one incident where she was rushing to pick up her children at school and was sitting outside in her car when a client with a foot fetish messaged her, asking for a picture of her toes.

The 40-year-old said she made a decision to come clean because she wanted to be free, saying she did not think it was 'such a big bloody deal', adding: 'Who am I hurting?'

Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms X said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book. 

'I didn’t wake up one day and say I’m going to write a book about being a hooker. I’ve thought about this very carefully, I’ve been seeing a child psychologist for a year,' she said.

Ms X also claimed that her current job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones

The escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012

'My kids know that mummy is a journalist… they know she makes sad people feel happy and they know she’s creative and wrote a book. That’s all they need to know at the moment.'

Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 after visiting a brothel during her lunch break while she was still a beauty editor for a magazine.

Two days later she was paid to have sex with men at an exclusive brothel in Sydney and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X.

But her parents - who live in a middle-class suburb in England - and her former partner were not as enamored with her new career path.

Ms X's parents told her she was 'disgusting' when they found out the truth and her ex-husband's response was: 'Are you effing serious?'.

After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she says she knows the secret to a happy marriage.

Ms X said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse.

She said she did not think that her clients sleeping with her were committing adultery because she gave her clients an outlet to escape from their normal lives and they could go home as happier husbands.

Ms X said most of her clients did not see it as straying from their wives because there was no emotional commitment.
