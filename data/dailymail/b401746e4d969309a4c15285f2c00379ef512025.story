They share a penchant for tennis, blonde men and thrifty high street buys and now it seems that the Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa have another passion in common - polo.

Just weeks after the Duchess was seen enjoying a match in Gloucestershire with Prince George, her younger sister has been spotted at another match, this time in Gstaad.

Watching from the sidelines with boyfriend Nico Jackson, Pippa, who was pretty in a floral dress and a jacket by French label Sandro, looked happy and relaxed as she joked with her stockbroker beau.

Chatty: Pippa and Nico were absorbed in close conversation for much of the match in the resort of Gstaad

The couple were in Gstaad, a ski resort so luxurious that it boasts permanent branches of Moncler and Louis Vuitton on its high street, to see the teams go head to head in the Hublot Polo Gold Cup.

An annual event, the match brings some of the world's wealthiest people to the resort, among them regular visitors Bernie Ecclestone and yachting tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli.

Such is the prestige and prize money of a win in Gstaad, the tournament regularly attracts top name players such as England captain Luke Tomlinson and top French talent, Thibault Guillemin.

Although Pippa isn't known to play polo, she and Jackson do share a passion for sports and skiing in particular.

Move: Pippa's boyfriend Nico recently moved to Geneva, which is just two hours by train from Gstaad

Indeed, it was during a ski holiday that the couple met and the pair have since returned to resorts in Switzerland and Austria for winter holidays together.

Although the duo have yet to ski in Gstaad, instead choosing the upmarket resorts of Lech in Austria and St Moritz in Switzerland, the Alpine town is less than two hours by train from Nico's new home in Geneva.

The 36-year-old stockbroker recently left his job at Deutsche Bank in London for a lucrative new role at a hedge fund based in the Swiss city.Â
