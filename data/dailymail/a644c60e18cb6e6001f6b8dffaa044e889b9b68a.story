It may sound like something from a sci-fi film but the next generation of Apple phones and tablets could be made from a super-strong substance called liquidmetal.

Liquidmetal is a slow cooling alloy which means it can be moulded more easily than steel or aluminium, for example, and is more hard wearing. 

A series of new patents filed by the California-based firm explain how the company could use this alloy, along with 3D printing, to quickly manufacture the casing for new devices.

A series of new patents filed by Apple detail how the company could use liquidmetal alloy, known as BMG, along with 3D printing, to manufacture the casing for new devices, pictured. Layers of BMG could be printed to also create parts needed for phones, tablets and even TVs

Liquidmetal is a mix of titanium, nickel, 
copper and zirconium among other metals making it tough, light and scratch 
resistant. It also feels as smooth as glass.

The patents detail a process that 
involves injection moulding and 3D printing using bulk metallic glasses 
(BMG) powder - another name for liquidmetal. 

Layers of BMG could be printed using a 3D printer to create the casing for phones, tablets and even TVs.

It could also be used to produce the more complex and smaller parts needed for inside phones, too, as well as make the devices super-slim.

Rumours about Apple using liquidmetal have been around for years after the company signed an exclusive deal with specialists Liquidmetal Technologies in 2010.

The new patents have fuelled these claims further and follow rumours that Apple is also looking into using sapphire crystal in future versions of its displays. 

These rumours were similarly started after Apple signed an exclusive deal, this time with sapphire mineral experts GT Advanced Technologies.

Both technologies produce 
super-strong products and Apple may might be attempting to move away from its 
reputation for making fragile devices.

Rumours about liquidmetal iPhones originated back in 2010. These concept images show what a new super-slim liquidmetal handset might look like. They were designed for Apple fansite MacRumors

Traditional metals have what's called a crystalline structure, pictured left. Liquidmetal, by comparison, has an amorphous structure, pictured right. The white spaces in the crystalline structure are weak spots, whereas amorphous materials form fewer gaps meaning they have fewer weak spots, making them stronger overall

These layers could then be moulded 
into shape using lasers and the process would be similar to how plastic 
is moulded for phone cases among other uses.

Apple
 already uses liquidmetal for its SIM-ejector tool which is used
 like a pin to pop the SIM-card holder out from the side of the latest 
iPhones. 

The patent, originally discovered by Patently Apple, explains the process could be used for: â€˜a telephone, such as a cell 
phone, and a land-line phone, or any communication device, such as a 
smart phone, including, for example an iPhone, and an electronic email 
sending/receiving device. It can be a part of a display, such as a 
digital display, a TV monitor, an electronic-book reader, an iPad, and a
 computer monitor.â€™

Liquidmetal is a slow cooling substance that can be moulded easily

@highlight

It's stronger than current metals used to make phones and other gadgets

@highlight

The technology is used in 3D printers known as a powder called BMG

Apple could use this powder to make printing complex parts faster

This could ultimately lower production costs and lead to cheaper handsets
