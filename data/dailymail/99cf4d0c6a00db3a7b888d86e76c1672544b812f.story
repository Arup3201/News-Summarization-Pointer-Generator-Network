Former Laguna Beach star Lauren Conrad has unveiled her latest collection for Kohl’s, a festive selection of sparkly skirts, chunky sweaters and glamorous party dresses – all of which are modeled by Lauren herself.

The ultra-feminine looks feature a pretty palette of pastel shades that are well-suited to the former reality star’s girly style.

The campaign sees Lauren, who married law student and musician William Tell in September, showcasing some of her favorite looks from the collection, including a fuzzy sweater emblazoned with the word ‘Joy’, a classic black cocktail dress and an ethereal pink party frock.

In another image, the new Mrs Tell can be seen hanging a bunch of mistletoe while wearing a polka-dotted crop top and flirty skirt. 

Despite the collection’s festive theme, there is not a single snowflake in sight in any of the images – which is perfectly suited to Lauren’s California lifestyle. 

The entire clothing collection, which ranges from $36 to $90, will hit stores the first or second week of November. Some items are already available.

The fresh-faced star took another opportunity to show off her designing skills this week when she posted a series of images of her elaborate home-made mermaid costume which she created especially for Halloween.

She even shared step-by-step instructions for the DIY getup, which she made with seashells, shimmery fabric and sequins.

The designer, who got her start as an intern at Teen Vogue, later told the magazine that she always wanted to work in fashion.

'It's what I wanted to do for as long as I can remember,' she said. 'My father was an architect and my neighbor who used to watch me after school was an artist, so I grew up in a very creative environment.'
