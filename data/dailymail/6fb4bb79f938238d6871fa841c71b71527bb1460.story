Ploy: Visa will disable 27 LINK cash machines and replace them with just eight Visa only cashpoints

Olympics sponsor Visa has been accused of exploiting spectators by effectively banning the use of rival cards at Games venues.

It is ordering the closure of all cashpoints which accept Mastercard or American Express.

Non-Visa customers will not even be able to use their cards to pay for goods at checkouts.  

The card giant will disable 27 LINK machines inside venues and replace them with just eight Visa-only cashpoints.

These will be found at the Olympic Park in East London and the Excel centre in nearby Docklands, leaving 34 venues – including Wembley Stadium – with no cashpoints at all.

Critics say this will entice spectators to apply for Visa cards and encourage even existing customers to pay by card for food, drinks and merchandise, boosting the company’s income from transaction fees incurred whenever a purchase is made.

Visa has also been accused of using the ban as a cynical ploy to promote its new ‘contactless’ payment cards, which will be accepted at the venues.

These allow shoppers to make payments of up to £15 by simply swiping the card at a till.

Visa is a top-tier sponsor of London 2012 and has exclusive rights over the Games’ payment system.

Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, predicted long queues at cashpoints outside venues.

He said: ‘This is shocking. It is a privilege to be a sponsor of the Olympics and they are abusing that privilege by exploiting consumers.

‘Non-Visa customers will be angry and concerned by this kind of discrimination. Where are we heading with this? Will we cover up manhole covers with Thames Water on them because it is not a sponsor? This should be a joyous event and instead it is being marshalled in a controlled and rather sinister “1984” manner.’

Critics have said the Visa removing cashpoints around the Olympic park is a cynical scheme to make more from credit card transaction fees

UK Payments Council director Ron Delnevo called Visa ‘power-crazed’.

He said: ‘The Olympics do not belong to any sponsor, however much money they have paid. McDonald’s is a sponsor but it is not forcing everyone to eat only hamburgers.

‘This is plainly unacceptable in a world where 85 per cent plus of all transactions continue to be made using cash.

‘The Games are meant to be a celebration of the sporting prowess of men and women from every corner of our planet.

‘Sadly, it seems that the ideals of the Olympics now take a back seat whenever they get in the way of needs of commercial sponsors.’

He added that he believed the move was a shameless way of Visa promoting its new contactless cards, which he said had proved unpopular in the UK because of security concerns.

‘The vast majority of people attending the Games, from over 200 countries, have no interest in becoming guinea pigs in product launches by sponsors,’ he said.

The disabling of cashpoints by Visa means that some Olympic venues, including Wembley Stadium, will have no cashpoints at all

Visa said: ‘At every Olympic Games, Visa creates and manages the entire payment system infrastructure and network throughout all Olympic Games venues.

‘Eight ATMs will be installed at London 2012 Olympic venues and this year, for the first time at an Olympic and Paralympic Games, contactless payment technology will be implemented across the event venues providing additional ways to pay.

‘Visa debit, credit and prepaid cards and cash will be accepted at all venues.’

A spokesman added that more than 115million Visa cards were in circulation in the UK and the majority of UK banks issue Visa debit cards.
