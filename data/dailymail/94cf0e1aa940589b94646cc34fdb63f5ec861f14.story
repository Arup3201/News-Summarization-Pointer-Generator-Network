For many women the idea of running a 10km race is nothing short of terrifying.

But Nike and Elle magazine are hoping to quash that fear by hosting a fun, fashionable women's-only race in London next month.

The sports giant and fashion magazine are encouraging 7,000 women across London and the UK to participate in ‘We Own The Night’ – an after-hours 10km run on Saturday 18th May.

Get fit: Nike and Elle magazine are hosting a 10k run called 'We Own The Night' around Victoria Park

Taking place in London’s Victoria Park, the six mile route will be filled with strobe lights, photobooths and plenty of high tempo music to motivate women to get fit and have fun.

For novice runners that need a little inspiration there is a six-week personalised training programme online to help get them on track for the run ahead.

And Nike technology means that runners can track their time,
distance, pace and calories burned via a fitness app to see
how they're getting on.

Fun run: The run will feature stroke lights, high tempo music and even photobooths along the way to encourage women to get fit and have fun

Each week ELLEUK.com will feature updates from the ELLE Running Club including video tutorials, guest running blogs, need-to-know expert tips, ELLE’s edit of the most stylish running kit and essential dietary advice so women can really immerse themselves in the challenge.

There will also be physical classes on offer that will include weekly ‘Run with ELLE’ and ‘Train with ELLE’ events across London.
