An obese mother who weighed nearly 21 stone has lost a third of her body weight in two years after she swapped sugary snacks for mushy peas.

Kim Eyre, 34, tipped the scales at 20st 9lbs after years of eating sausage rolls, crisps and chocolate bars.

At her heaviest, Kim had a 46in waist and was so encumbered by her size that it took her several minutes to walk to her front door.

Decision: The school administrator decided to 
lose weight after seeing a picture of herself at an office party where she says she was the 'biggest by far' of all her colleagues

Super slimmer: Kim Eyre shed eight stone in just two years by ditching chocolate bars to snack on mushy peas

But the school administrator decided 
to lose weight after seeing a picture of herself looking larger than she
 liked with her work colleagues.

She joined Slimming World and swapped sugary snacks and fast food for low-calorie mushy peas which she munches on twice a day.

Incredibly, in just two years she lost 8st 6lbs and dropped eight dress sizes.

She now weighs 12st 3lbs and has slimmed from a size 28 to a size 12 and 32in waist.

Single mother of three Kim, from Carlton, Nottingham, said: 'I snack on mushy peas at least twice a day. I love them.

'If I'm hungry when I get home then I'll have some mushy peas before my dinner.

'I loved mushy peas as a kid, my dad 
used to take me to a fish and chip shop every week and I would just have
 these amazing mushy peas.

The old her: She weighed 20st 9lb on a diet of 
Greggs sausage rolls, crisps and chocolate bars but now fills her plates
 with plenty of fresh vegetables

As she was: She shifted the weight by ditching 
sugary treats and now she goes to Zumba classes three times a week and 
goes to the gym at least once a week

'So when I started this diet I found 
some canned mushy peas, just little cans, and they taste just like they 
did when I was a kid.

'So I snack on them when I feel 
hungry at home, say before tea, as vegetables are free it means I am not
 cheating on my diet and they fill me up.

'I decided enough was enough one day in 2011 when I saw a photo of me with some work colleagues.

'I was shocked, I was the biggest in the photo by a long way. I just thought, this can't go on.'

Kim followed the Extra Easy diet 
through Slimming World which encourages people to fill-up on salad, 
vegetables and fruit rather than chocolate and sausage rolls.

She added: 'Extra easy diet is basically where a lot of foods like potatoes and pasta are "free".

'So you could have a jacket potato 
with chicken breast but the golden rule is that a third of your plate is
 filled with "super free" food like salad, vegetables or fruit.

'That really works for me because 
when I started I could have a large portion with a large side salad and 
I've gradually cut my portions down.

'Before I could have three or four packets of crisps in the car on the way home from work.

'It was a case of "no one's seen me eating them so it doesn't count".

'I'd tried to do it before and failed because I wasn't in the right frame of mind.

'I went to the weigh-ins and said I wasn't cheating but I clearly was because I didn't lose the weight.

And Kim says her children are delighted with her achievement.

'They are really proud, even with the older one who doesn't say much, you can tell.

'It nearly choked me up when my daughter gave me a hug and said she could fit her arms around me.'

Lifestyle change: Kim was so shocked when she 
saw a picture of her former 20st 9lb frame that she decided enough was 
enough and she would lose the extra weight

Green diet: She joined Slimming World and 
swapped sugary snacks and fast food for low-calorie mushy peas which she
 munches on twice a day, losing 8st 6lbs and dropping eight dress sizes

'We all want to lose weight but it's having the will power to stick to what you need to do.

'I've always been the biggest person in the photo.

'I got to the point where I just didn't like it anymore. I didn't want my oldest to be embarrassed that I was his mum.

'To be honest I don't know what happened, this time something just clicked. I was focused and determined.

'I now attend Zumba classes three times a week and go to the gym at least once a week.

'I feel so much fitter. My target is 11st 9, then I will have lost nine stone.'

Slimming World leader Debbie Wilson 
has been working in Nottingham for more than 20 years and says Kim is 
the biggest weight loser she's had.

She said: 'When she came before she lost a little bit of weight but it always went back on. This time she's done great.

'She's completely stuck to the diet. She's been really organised and determined and I think that's the key.'
