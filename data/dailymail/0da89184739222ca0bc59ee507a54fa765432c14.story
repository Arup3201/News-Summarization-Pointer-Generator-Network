After spending nearly seven hours explaining 'in great detail' his claims of the harassment he suffered in the Miami Dolphins locker room, 'bullied' offensive tackle Jonathan Martin says he plans to continue his career in the NFL.

Martin met with league officials and NFL investigator Ted Wells on Friday to discuss the alleged bullying he suffered at the hands of teammate Richie Incognito - and others - that ultimately led to his leaving the team last month to seek treatment for depression.

Following the meeting, the 6-foot-5, 312 pound Martin declined comment on the details of the meeting, only saying that he planned to return to professional football.

'Bullied': Jonathan Martin says that he plans to return to football after leaving his team over hazing practices

'Although I went into great detail 
with Mr. Ted Wells and his team, I do not intend to discuss this matter 
publicly at this time," Martin told reporters outside of the NFL's New 
York City headquarters. 'This is the right way to handle the situation.'

Martin went on to say that, 'beyond that, I look forward to working through the process and resuming my career in the National Football League.'

Martin still
 could sue the Dolphins for big money under a variety of workplace laws,
 and could turn to his own legal eagle mother - and attorney specializing in employment law - for advice.

The employment legislation
 makes employers liable for bullying, harassment and discrimination - 
even if the team's hierarchy didn't know about it, according to several 
legal experts.

Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also 
plans to meet with Martin at a later date.

Martin's
 mother, Jane Howard-Martin, spent almost 20 years practicing employment
 law and wrote numerous articles in legal journals on such issues as 
workplace discrimination and harassment. It's not known whether she has 
any role in her son's decisions; Howard-Martin is now assistant general 
counsel for Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. in Los Angeles.

The league currently is trying to gather information about the harassment Martin says he was subjected to by Incognito to determine an appropriate penalty and remedy to what several NFL players have described as a 'culture' of bullying in NFL locker rooms.

Suing the Dolphins could be more 
successful than bringing criminal charges against Incognito, who was suspended by the Dolphins after
 Martin left the team two and a half weeks ago.

Martin's attorney, David Cornwell, says Martin was repeatedly harassed 
by Incognito and others in ways that 'went far beyond the traditional 
locker room hazing'.

The alleged bullying includes racial slurs, harassment and Incognito allegedly forcing Martin to pay $15,000 for Dolphins players to take a trip to Las Vegas. Martin paid the money, but did not go on the trip.

Incognito, who has a history of drunken antics and on-field thuggery, claims he's not a racist and that he and Martin actually are good friends.

For Martin to win a lawsuit against the Dolphins, Nova Southeastern University law professor Bob Jarvis said he'd have to show that the harassment went above and beyond the norm in terms of locker room hazing.

'It
 will be crucial for Martin to convince a jury that even with a rough 
workplace, there is a line that cannot be crossed and it was crossed 
here,' Jarvis said.

One path for Martin to take would be filing a grievance with the NFL players union or a complaint with the NFL itself.

Aside
 from that, legal experts say there are several avenues he could take to
 sue the Dolphins. Cornwell did not respond to an email asking for 
additional comment on any of these options.

Two labor-employment lawyers at Venable 
LLP in New York, Michael Volpe and Nicholas Reiter, said in a written 
analysis of the Martin matter that employers can face lawsuits related 
to bullying if the harassment involved a victim's race, religion, sexual
 orientation or disability.

'Even if the Dolphins were unaware of Incognito's alleged behavior, which may be the case, the organization could still face claims of liability,' they said.

There have also been reports that Incognito was told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin, which could show the team did have knowledge about the harassment, the two lawyers said.

Still, it's no slam dunk for Martin.

For Incognito himself, the main issue would likely be his future NFL playing career. The NFL players' union announced Thursday that Incognito has filed a grievance over his indefinite suspension by the Dolphins. The union statement says that Incognito is requesting an expedited hearing so he can resume playing football immediately.

Tamara Lave, a law professor at the University of Miami, said the current national focus on bullying and hazing in schools and at the workplace would figure in Martin's favor should he take legal action. Especially, she said, because he is a physically imposing NFL player — 6-foot-5, 312 pounds — who is typically perceived as having few weaknesses.

'The fact that you have a 300-pound man who feels so threatened and uncomfortable that he leaves, that's an indication of how serious it was,' Lave said.

From the criminal standpoint, former prosecutor David S. Weinstein said it's possible but not likely that Incognito could be charged with extortion if he made threats to force Martin to pay the $15,000 for the Vegas trip. Another option would be written threats to do bodily harm, based on Incognito's texts to Martin making threats about his mother.

'However, I don't really see the (state prosecutors) going after Incognito, but I could be wrong,' Weinstein said.

Florida does have an anti-hazing law, but Jarvis said it applies only to educational institutions and not adult workplaces.
