Around 40 people are still missing 48 hours after a runaway freight train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in a Quebec town - leading to fears they may have been vaporized in the blast with no remains to be found.

Five people were killed after the train sparked a massive inferno in Lac-Megantic, which is about 250km from Montreal, in the early hours on Saturday morning.

But it is believed the death toll will with experts suggesting that some remains may never be found because of the intensity and duration of the oil fires which locals claim erupted like an 'atom bomb'.

Genevieve Guilbault, a spokesperson for 
the provincial coroner's office, said: 'It is not impossible when we 
look at the intensity of the explosion.

'We can deduce that many of the bodies are severely burned. That complicates identification, but all necessary means at our disposal will be used to identify them.'

Parts
 of the town were evacuated in the early hours as 
fireballs shot several meters in the air, flames spread to nearby homes 
and thick acrid smoke filled the air.

Around 30 buildings were destroyed
 by the massive blaze, including the Musi-Cafe which was packed with revellers when the tankers erupted just ten yards away.

'On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there were a lot of people there,' said Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant near the blast site. 'It was a big explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population.'

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was like an atomic bomb. It was very hot. Everybody was afraid.'

Police said a higher death toll was inevitable, and authorities feared 
the number might soar once they're able to reach the hardest-hit areas. 
Worries remained over the status of two oil-filled train cars.

Pollution: Environmental workers are monitoring the plumes of smoke, as well as contamination of a river

Quebec provincial police Sgt. 
Beno√Æt Richard said only a small part of the devastated area had been 
searched Sunday, more than a day since the accident, because 
firefighters were making sure all fires were out.

The train's 72 
oil-filled tanker cars somehow came loose early Saturday morning, sped 
downhill at nearly seven miles (11 kilometers) into the town, derailed and 
began exploding one by one. At least five exploded.

The eruptions 
sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling through the streets under the 
intense heat of towering fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the 
night sky.

The district is a popular area packed with bars that often 
bustles on summer weekend nights. Police said the first explosion tore 
through the town shortly after 1am local time. Fire then spread to 
several homes.

Waiting: More than 160 people stayed in an emergency shelter that was set up by the Red Cross on Saturday night

Two tanker cars were burning on Sunday morning, and 
authorities were still worried about them Sunday evening. Local Fire 
Chief Denis Lauzon said firefighters were staying 500 feet (150 meters) 
from the tankers, which were being doused with water and foam to keep 
them from overheating.

The growing number of trains carrying crude oil in Canada and the United States had raised concerns of a major derailment.

One death was confirmed Saturday. Police confirmed two people were found dead overnight and confirmed two more deaths Sunday afternoon. The charred remains were sent to Montreal for identification.

Locals were convinced the death toll was far higher than five. Anne-Julie Huot, 27, said at least five friends and about 20 acquaintances remained unaccounted for. She said she was lucky to be working that night, otherwise she likely would have been at a popular bar that was leveled in the blast.

Destruction: About 30 buildings in the center of the town, near the border with Maine, have burnt down

Wiped out: Piles of brick are all that remain of several buildings close to where the rail cars exploded

Rubble: The remains of a building flattened in the blast can be seen through the smoke

'I have a friend who was smoking outside the bar when it happened, and she barely got away, so we can guess what happened to the people inside,' Huot said. 'It's like a nightmare. It's the worst thing I can imagine.'

About a third of the community of 6,000 was forced out of their homes. The town is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) east of Montreal and just west of the Maine border.

Transportation Safety Board investigator Donald Ross said the black box of the locomotive has been recovered, but officials haven't been able to access much of the site.

Edward Burkhardt, the president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic because the engineer had finished his run. The tanker cars somehow came loose.

'We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,' Burkhardt said. 'Well, I think we've blown it here.'

Wiped out: The downtown was flattened by the blast, which occurred at around 1am on Saturday after the runaway train carrying oil tankers crashed

Ruins: More than 30 properties were wiped out by the massive explosion in the town at 1am on Saturday and many people are still unaccounted for

Smouldering: Burnt out oil tank cars can be seen after the flames were finally put out on Sunday. Scores of people are still missing following the explosion

Joe McGonigle, Montreal, Maine & Atlantic's vice president of marketing, said the company believes the brakes were the cause.

'Somehow those brakes were released, and that's what is going to be investigated,' McGonigle said. 'We're pretty comfortable saying it is the brakes. The train was parked, it was tied up. The brakes were secured. Somehow it got loose.'

McGonigle said there was no reason to suspect any criminal or terror-related activity.

The train's oil was being transported from North Dakota's Bakken oil region to a refinery in New Brunswick. Because of limited pipeline capacity in the Bakken region and in Canada, oil producers are increasingly using railroads to transport much of the oil to refineries.

The Canadian Railway Association recently estimated that as many as 140,000 carloads of crude oil will be shipped on Canada's tracks this year - up from just 500 carloads in 2009. The Quebec disaster is the fourth freight train accident in Canada under investigation involving crude oil shipments since the beginning of the year.

Greenpeace Canada said Sunday that federal safety regulations haven't kept up with the enormous growth in the shipment of oil by rail.

'We think it is safe. We think we have a safe operation,' McGonigle said of carrying oil by rail. 'No matter what mode of transportation you are going to have incidents. That's been proven. This is an unfortunate incident.'
