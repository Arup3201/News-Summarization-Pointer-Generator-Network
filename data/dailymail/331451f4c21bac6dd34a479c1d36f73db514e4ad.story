Just a day after Apple's keynote live stream announcement of the iPhone 6, Samsung took to YouTube to poke fun of the new product's shortcomings.

Videos posted on the Samsung YouTube channel on Wednesday night feature two faux Apple Genius workers in a back room of what appears to be an Apple repair room.

The first video parodies Apple's key note live stream which staggers, stalls and was an overall fail for the announcement.

Geek wars: Samsung releases SIX parodies of new Apple products to show the technology in them is already on the market in their products

Five videos poking fun at Apple's iPhone 6 and Apple Watch, both products that Samsung has similar products to

Next the pair banter about Apple's iPhone 6 making fun of the larger screens, lack of multi-windows, touch without a stylus and the notorious battery life all of which Apple has built a reputation for.

The last video criticizes the hype over the Apple Watch bashing the wearable smartwatch which enables users to use the watch as a phone, a map, a heart rate monitor and connect with other Apple Watch wearers.

Strangely knocking a product that they have five similar versions of, makes no sense but all is fair in the smartphone war.

Samsung's It Doesn't Take A Genius parody campaign pokes fun at new Apple products that claim to have new technology

Samsung has a long history of satirical advertising and this new series called 'It doesn't take a genius to realise' campaigns is just a reboot of the 2012 campaign where the Korean company mocked Apple for the iPhone 5.

In August Samsung mocked iPhone users, calling them 'wall huggers' because they constantly need to recharge the handset's battery.

But it's not just Samsung who play dirty, Apple released an advertisement in 2011 starring comedian and actor Justin Long to embody an Apple Mac while a pudgy, suit-wearing man played the role of a boring and outdated PC.

The smartphone war doesn't look like it will end anytime soon as sales for both companies are neck and neck.
