For New Yorkers it is almost as essential to Christmas as Santa and stockings - and this year's Rockefeller Centre tree was yesterday cut down to begin its 155-mile journey to Manhattan.

The lucky tree is an 85ft Norway spruce from Hemlock Township, central Pennsylvania, and workers yesterday cut it down and hoisted it onto a trailer.

The 13-ton tree will be illuminated for the first time on December 3 in a ceremony that's been held since 1933 and attracts tens of thousands of people.

Timber: The 85ft tree was cut down by workers this morning in Hemlock Township, central Pennsylvania

For the chop: The impressive tree had been on the Rockefeller Center's radar for a few years

The tree stood at the home of Dan Sigafoos and Rachel Drosdick-Sigafoos, who bought their home on Frosty Valley Road in Hemlock Township two years ago, fully aware that the tree behind their barn was already coveted by the Rockefeller Center.

Then an official rang earlier this year to give them the news that the tree was destined for great things.

'They said this is going to be the tree,' Mrs Drosdick-Sigafoo told 1010 WINS. 

'I had said to Dan, "If this happens, you do realize that Christmas starts a lot earlier this year".'

Erik Pauze, head gardener for Rockefeller Center, said he found the tree a couple of years ago, but it wasn't quite ready.

'I came by every now and then, checked it out, and when they bought the house and they contacted me again I came by and it was perfect, it was ready to go,' Mr Pauze said.

'This tree is great. Nice and tall, nice and straight and it's going to look great in front of Rockefeller Center.'
