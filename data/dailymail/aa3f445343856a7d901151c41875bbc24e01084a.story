Callum McGregor insists Celtic are ready to win their Europa League group by sinking FC Astra both home and away.

The Romanians visit Parkhead on Thursday after losing their opening games to Red Bull Salzburg and Dinamo Zagreb and winning just one of their last eight.

That led to the sacking last week of under-fire boss Daniel Isiala, with former Steaua Bucharest coach Oleg Protasov taking over after a nine-year absence from Romanian football, and young midfielder McGregor says Ronny Deila’s side will compound their misery with victories in their back-to-back games.

Boosted by Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Ross County, in which he claimed his fifth Celtic goal of the season, the 21-year-old declared: ‘I feel we can win our Europa League section now.

‘We have started well with the draw (with Red Bull Salzburg) and the win (over Dinamo Zagreb) and I definitely feel if we can beat Astra on Thursday night we can go on and top the group. In fact, six points from the two matches would be massive and that’s what we’re looking for.’

Former Soviet Union striker Protasov could do nothing to solve Astra’s current crisis on Sunday and said they require ‘immediate surgery’ after his first game was drawn 1-1 with minnows Gaz Metan Medias.

McGregor has also vowed to fight his way back into the Scotland squad for next month’s double header with Ireland and England.

He earned a shock call-up to Gordon Strachan’s squad for the narrow defeat to world champions Germany in Dortmund.

But the experience proved short lived when Ryan Gauld and Stevie May came in for the games with Georgia and Poland instead.

McGregor says he has no intention of fading into the international shadows.

‘Of course dropping out of the Scotland squad was disappointing. But when I was picked for the Germany game, I said at the time it had come early in my career and it was a bonus.

‘My main focus is to play well and score goals for Celtic, but if I keep playing well and doing that, there is no reason why I can’t get back into the set-up.

‘It’s not a case of waiting to see what happens, I’m trying to get in. I’ve had a taste of it, I really enjoyed it and I want more.’
