Slaven Bilic has warned Arsenal that his Besiktas side will not be starstruck in their Champions League qualifying tie and are fully focused on ruining Arsene Wenger's European dream.

The Gunners are bidding to reach the group stages of the continent's premier club competition for the 17th consecutive year but must get past the Turks over two legs, starting with Tuesday night's first game at the fearsome 76,000-capacity Ataturk Stadium.

Wenger's men kicked off their Premier League season with victory against Crystal Palace and boast some world-famous players in their ranks, but Besiktas boss Bilic said that Alexis Sanchez, Aaron Ramsey and Co hold no fear for his players.

'We are not here to take selfies with Arsenal on the pitch, we are here to battle to the end,' Bilic said at his pre-match press conference.

'Don't expect our players to take selfies with Alexis Sanchez, (Olivier) Giroud and (Mikel) Arteta or be in a hurry to swap shirts at half time, we believe we can qualify and will do everything we can to make it happen.

'We know who we are playing very well, Arsenal may be favourites however, this doesn't mean we are going to lay down and roll over.

'Look at the Champions League logo behind me, they say a picture tells a thousand words, well look at that logo, that is where we want to be, that is our plan, that is our dream and we will do everything we can to get there.'

Bilic may have to beat Arsenal without defender Atiba Hutchinson and attacking midfielder Gokhan Tore, who are both injury doubts for the game.

'Tore may not be ready we will decide tomorrow,' Bilic said. 'Atiba isn't 100 per cent yet either, both players will be a game time decision.'
