Carla Bruni looked every inch the model mother as she enjoyed a visit to the zoological gardens in Paris with daughter Giulia on Sunday.

She might be the current uber glamorous face of jewellery brand Bulgari but Mrs Nicolas Sarkozy cut a relaxed figure as she strolled with her girl wearing simple, flared jeans, a black blazer and a boho fedora.

The musician, 43, favours a 70s style in her down time and seemed laid-back and happy as she strolled through the gardens with her blonde-haired daughter, who is two next month.

Hitching a ride: 43-year-old Carla channelled her favourite boho style in jeans and a felt fedora

Company: The pair were joined on their day out at Paris's zoological gardens by a man who seemed to be a minder

Carla also has an 11-year-old son, Aurelien, from a previous relationship with Raphael Enthoven, a philosopher.

On Monday she was spotted sitting with
 a male friend in the sunshine outside Paris restaurant La Mediteranee, 
chatting animatedly before lighting up a post-prandial cigarette.

Resplendent
 in an on-trend tartan shirt worn over a black vest and skinny jeans, 
the model and her male companion left the cafe together and spoke 
briefly before heading off in separate directions.

The mother-of-two had a busy few weeks the run-up to a holiday at Cap Negre in the south of France at the beginning of August and has worked solidly on promoting the jewellery campaign since.

After performing at the Echo Music Awards in the middle of July, the former first lady jetted off to New York to promote the new Bulgari campaign and take part in an interview for broadcaster CNBC.

In it, she revealed that it was love at first sight with politician husband Nicholas Sarkozy, 58, and said she just knew it was a 'match'.

'It was love at first sight. I must say, we left the dinner party together,' she breathlessly told the broadcaster. 'People were like... (laughs) and we got married three months after.'

Au revoir: After a flurry of Gallic kisses, Carla and her friend headed off in separate cars

Speaking about what attracted her to the 58-year-old, who has three sons from his previous relationships, she said: 'I don't know, his intelligence, his charisma, his kindness, his way of talking.'

But her stay wasn't without controversy, after it was revealed that she accepted a free first class flight with Air France - despite the airline making significant staff cuts at the time.

Since returning to France, Bruni has split her time between relaxing in Cap Negre and working on the new Bulgari campaign.

Photos released last month showed Bruni back to her dazzling best as she posed with some of the Italian jeweller's incredible gems.
