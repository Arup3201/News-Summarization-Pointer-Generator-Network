Across the Arctic region 700 years ago, the last of the Paleo-Eskimos disappeared, ultimately being replaced by ancestors of the modern-day Inuit and Eskimo cultures.

Exactly what happened to this group of people, known as the Dorset culture, has remained a mystery. 

But now extensive research suggests this remaining group may have been wiped out due to a combination of inbreeding and climate change, ultimately perishing in isolation while the other groups lived on.

Research led by the University of Copenhagen provides new theories as to how the first inhabitants of the Arctic disappeared 700 years ago, which coincided with descendants of modern-day Inuits and Eskimos arriving (stock image shown). Their extinction is shrouded in mystery, as they vanished in mere decades

The research, headed by the Centre for Geogenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, was published in the journal Science. 

The North American Arctic was one of the last major regions to be settled by modern humans.

This happened when people crossed the Bering Strait from Siberia and wandered into a new world. 

While the area has long been well researched by archaeologists, little is known of its genetic prehistory. 

In this study, researchers showed that the Paleo-Eskimo, who lived in the Arctic from about 5,000 years ago until about 700 years ago, represented a distinct wave of migration, separate from both Native Americans - who crossed the Bering Strait much earlier - and the Inuit, who came from Siberia to the Arctic several thousand years after the Paleo-Eskimos.

The genetic studies show that the Paleo-Eskimos - representing one single group - were the first people in the Arctic, and they survived without outside contact for over 4,000 years.

But, after surviving in near-isolation in the harsh Arctic environment for more than 4,000 years, they disappeared around 700 years ago - about the same time when the ancestors of modern-day Inuit spread eastward from Alaska.

The genetic study, which involved more than 150 human remains, claims that Paleo-Eskimos were the first people in the Arctic - and they survived without outside contact for more than 4,000 years.

However the arrival of the ancestors of modern-day Inuits, around 1500 AD, is said to have forced the Paleo-Eskimos into a mass-migration that ultimately led to their demise in just a matter of decades

In the research they obtained 26 genome-wide sequences and 169 mitochondrial DNA sequences from ancient human bone, teeth, and hair samples from Arctic Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland.

They also examined genomes of two present-day Greenlandic Inuit, two Siberian Nivkhs, one Aleutian Islander, and two Athabascan Native Americans. 

Twenty-seven ancient samples were then radiocarbon dated for accurate cultural assignment.

The research rejects previous theories that Paleo-Eskimos were descendants of native Americans.

The conclusion is that their disappearance was not due to them being assimilated into other cultures like the Thule people, who arrived at the Arctic later.

But while some conclusions can be ruled out, the exact cause of their extinction remains somewhat shrouded in mystery.

According to Joshua Krisch of the New York Times, one of the reasons for their disappearance could have been inbreeding.

'Certainly they survived for almost 5,000 years, so they weren't completely destroyed by inbreeding,' Dr Eske Willerslev, who led the study, told the New York Times.

'But it causes a number of medical problems, and I wouldn't be surprised if that had an effect on them.'

And Dr Todd Disotell, a professor of anthropology at New York University, added that the harsh tundra life coupled with the effects of climate change, namely dwindling food sources as the temperature shifted, would have contributed to their extinction.

'When you're dealing with sea ice, just a few degrees can be transformative,' Dr. Disotell said. 

'Three bad winters in a row where you can't hunt seals, and you're in trouble.'

The extinction of Paleo-Eskimos in mere decades is a mystery. It's thought they may have been driven out by technologically superior people. Their food sources may also have dwindled as temperatures changed due to climate change. Pictured is a researcher looking for ancient human remains in northern Greenland

However there is still more research to be done into their disappearance.

The study was unable to establish why the extinction of the Paleo-Eskimos coincided with the ancestors of the Inuit beginning to colonise the Arctic.

It’s widely believed that the Inuit ancestors - who crossed the Bering Strait about 1,000 years ago and reached Greenland around 700 years ago - were technologically superior to the Paleo-Eskimos, which may have led to them being driven out.

The Inuit's own myths tell stories of a people before them, which likely refer to the Paleo-Eskimos.

In the myths, they are referred to as the 'Tunit' or 'Sivullirmiut', which means ‘the first inhabitants’.

According to these myths they were giants, who were taller and stronger than the Inuit, but easily frightened from their settlements by the newcomers.

‘Ever since the discovery of a Paleo-Eskimo culture in the North American Arctic in 1925, archaeologists have been mystified by their relationship with the Thule culture ancestors of the modern Inuit,’ said co-author Dr William Fitzhugh from the Arctic Studies Centre at the Smithsonian Institution.

‘Paleo-Eskimo culture was replaced rapidly around 1300 and 1400 AD, their only traces being references to 'Tunit' in Inuit mythology and adoption of some elements of Dorset technology.

‘This new genomic research settles outstanding issues in Arctic archaeology that have been debated for nearly a century, finding that Paleo-Eskimo and Neo-Eskimo people were genetically distinct, with separate origins in Eastern Siberia, and the Paleo-Eskimo remained isolated in the Eastern Arctic for thousands of years with no significant mixing with each other or with American Indians, Norse, or other Europeans,’ continued Dr Fitzhugh. 

The lack of inbreeding with other species is surprising, as many species of human have been known to mingle in this way in the past.

In fact, it is thought that Neanderthals were gradually phased out through breeding with modern humans. 

'Elsewhere, as soon as people meet each other, they have sex,' Willerslev told National Geographic. 

'Even potentially different species like Neanderthals [and modern humans] had sex, so this finding is extremely surprising.'
