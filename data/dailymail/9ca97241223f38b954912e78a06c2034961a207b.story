His staggering bravery during the heat of battle not only won him the ultimate military accolade for valour but also a heartfelt tribute from a young Winston Churchill.

Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Watson was shot in the thigh, arm and his hand while trying to clear a village in British India of murderous warriors.

But despite the appalling injuries - which he would modestly said were no more than 'grazes' - and debilitating blood loss, Lt Col Watson insisted on heading back through the hail of bullets and back into the fray.

He only stopped battling after fainting from blood loss.

Churchill - who was fighting in the North West Frontier region of British India under the command of General Jeffery and was part of the relief force that arrived the following 
day - later wrote of Lt Col 
Watson's heroics: '...the man will go on, unshaken and unflinching after
 he has received a severe and painful wound.'

It was also noted that the officer had
 'in all probability saved the whole force from being wiped out' by the 
Pashtun enemy who had massively outnumbered the British during the Siege
 of Malakan in 1897.

Lt Col Watson was awarded the VC for his bravery. He went on to serve in World War One but died from illness in 1917.

The details of his gallantry have come to light again as his family prepare to auction the Victoria Cross he won during that astonishing display of bravery.

Historic: A 'record of services' belonging to the Watson family is part of a collection of items which are expected to fetch £160,000 when auctioned

The medal, the highest military 
decoration for gallantry, has been passed down 
through the Watson family but is now expected to fetch £160,000 at sale.

David Erskine-Hill, of London 
auctioneers Dix Noonan and Webb, said: 'The North West Frontier was so 
oft the scene of savage fighting and heavy casualties in days of the 
Empire.

'And the story behind Thomas Watson's 
VC epitomises the very nature of that fighting - a small hillside 
village, surrounded by overwhelming numbers of hostile tribesmen, and a 
remarkable band of British and Indian troops who held on against all the
 odds, until relieved.

'Watson led two hair-raising charges at the cost of multiple wounds, including a shattered hand and ruptured artery.

'No wonder Winston Churchill, who 
arrived with the relief force the following morning, was later moved to 
describe Watson's courage as 'sublime'.

'But in common with many fellow VCs, 
Watson remained extremely modest about his accomplishments, his charming
 letter to his wife, written in haste soon after those momentous events,
 merely referring to one or two "grazes".'

Lt Col Watson, from Louth, Lincs, and was commissioned in to the Royal Engineers in 1888.

Tribute: Lt Col Watson's wife Edith, pictured, was also a decorated for nursing British soldiers in India

He married his wife Edith Welchman, 
who herself had previously been awarded the Royal Red Cross for her 
efforts in the nursing of British soldiers in India.

In September 1897 an army of 10,000 Pashtun tribesmen lay siege to the British garrison in Malakand.

On the night of September 16 at the 
village of Bilot that was being held by the enemy, Lt Col Watson rounded
 up 'a few' men of the East Kent Regiment and of the Bengal Sappers.

He led them in a charge of the remove the tribesmen who retaliated with heavy fire.

In his 1898 book, the Story of the 
Malakand Field Force, Churchill wrote of how the burning village was a 
'shambles' when the relief party arrived the next day.

The future Prime Minister wrote: 'All 
round lay corpses of men and mules. The bodies of five or six native 
soliders were being buried in a hurriedly dug grave.

'Eighteen wounded men lay side by side
 in a roofless hut, their faces drawn by pain and anxiety looked ghastly
 in the pale light of the early morning.'

Churchill's account of the action the night before stated: 'The village was too large for so small a party to clear.

'The tribesmen killed and wounded 
several of the soldiers and a bullet smashed Lieutenant Watson's hand. 
He however continued his efforts and did not cease untilo again shot, 
this time so severely as to be unable to stand.

'His men carried him from the village.'

Horours: Among the collection of military awards won by is the extremely rare Royal Red Cross group of three given to Sister E. Welchman, who later married Lt Col Thomas Watson

Four days later, while recovering from his wounds, Lt Col Watson wrote the letter to 'my own darling' wife.

He wrote his getting injured: 'I got 
touched on the right leg, only a graze...I went back to get some 
Sappers...I hurried backand was pointing out where the devils were 
sneaking up when I got a slight flesh wound in the inside of the right 
arm - niothing of consequence but unfortunately almost immediately 
afterwards I got hit badly on the left hand.'

The brave officer went on to fight
 in the First World War and was the commanding engineer of the 12th 
Inidian Division in Mesopotamia (Iraq) against the Ottoman Empire.

He contracted an illness from which he died in London in June 1917 aged 50.

His VC along with other medals and letters home is being sold on June 19.
