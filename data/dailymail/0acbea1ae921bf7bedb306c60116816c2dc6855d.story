British holidaymakers who hit the slopes in North America without proper insurance could break the bank if they suffer a serious injury, a new report says.

The study examined the medical costs associated with winter sport injuries suffered by uninsured travellers abroad and identified the US and Canada the most expensive countries, with sky-high bills for those without travel coverage.

It found that treatment for a broken leg would cost a staggering £26,000 in the US (approximately USD$40,000) and almost £15,000 in Canada (approximately CAD$28,000).

Uninsured Britons who suffer a winter sport injury in the US and Canada face sky-high medical bills 

The average cost per claim for a winter sport injury suffered in the US and Canada is more than £11,000, according to the study commissioned by Allianz Global Assistance UK and the Ski Club of Great Britain.

Of all the claims that were included in the study, the most expensive treatment covered by Allianz Global Assistance was for a head injury suffered in Canada, totalling more than £145,000 (nearly CAD$280,000) in medical and repatriation costs.

Barry Smith, Underwriting Manager for Allianz Global Assistance UK, said: ‘We have analysed data from hundreds of claims from the past few years and the results are enough to give you a chill even when you're not on a ski slope.

‘The remainder of our top five costs were all from the USA, ranging from £33,000 to £81,000 for various bone fractures.’

 Austria and Switzerland were named the third and fourth most expensive countries for medical assistance

He said an arm fracture suffered in the US would translate into a medical bill of nearly £41,000 (approximately USD$60,000).

Austria and Switzerland were named the third and fourth most expensive countries for medical assistance, with average costs of more than £2,000 and £1,200, respectively.

Frank McCusker, Chief Executive of Ski Club of Great Britain, urged people to purchase insurance before they travel abroad.

He said: ‘Whilst most skiers and snowboarders do of course return home in one piece, it doesn't take much to cause a serious, and seriously expensive, injury on the slopes.

‘The high costs we've seen in the past few years could leave an individual in financial difficulty if they did not have travel insurance to cover the bills on their behalf.

‘It could be a real false economy to cut out insurance to save a few pounds, and we urge those booking winter sports holidays this season to make sure they purchase good quality insurance to avoid being landed with any unaffordable medical bills.

'As with any type of insurance policy, individuals should read the details carefully to ensure it provides the cover they require.’
