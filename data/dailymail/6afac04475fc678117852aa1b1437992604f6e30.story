Olivier Giroud's first-half strike gave Arsenal hope of a famous victory before substitute Aaron Ramsey added a second late on but the hosts held on to secure a place in the last eight.

Abdennour said that Monaco more than earned their place in the quarter-finals alongside Real Madrid, Porto, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid.

'With Alexis Sanchez and players like Theo Walcott, they had a lot of pace on the flanks,' said the centre-back.

Aaron Ramsey added a second goal for the Gunners but they could not find a third to send them through

'We conceded two goals because of our lack of concentration but thankfully it didn't rip out our qualification chances.

'For me, Arsenal are one of the best teams in the world so I think our qualification is deserved considering the way we played against such a team.

'Now we must turn the page and focus on the next game in Ligue 1 so that we can try to get a top-three finish to have a chance at Champions League football next season.'
