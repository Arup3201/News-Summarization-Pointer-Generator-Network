A 13-year-old boy from Washington DC was fatally shot by his best friend when a loaded handgun they were playing with went off.

Tyrin Caldwell died Wednesday after a bullet struck him in the chest in his friend’s apartment on Downing Street in Northeast Washington.

His father, 31-year-old Tyrone Celey, said he believes the shooting was an accident and doesn't want any charges to be brought against Tyrin’s friend, a 14-year-old.

Too young: Tyrin Caldwell (pictured left and right), 13, was killed in an accidental shooting after his best friend fired a round from a gun the two boys were playing with

Crime scene: The accident took place on the third floor of the Brooklyn Manor apartment complex in Washington DC where Caldwell's friend lived with his mother 

The unnamed teenage shooter was placed in police custody immediately following the fatal incident.

Police responded to the Brooklyn Manor housing complex in the 1400 block of Downing Street at around 7.20pm Tuesday after getting a call about shots fired.

Officers went up to the third floor and found Tyrin Caldwell with a gunshot wound. The teen was still conscious and breathing.

Tyrin's father, who ran up to the apartment after hearing the gunshot, said his dying son kept repeating, 'Daddy, hurt,' according to NBC Washington. 

The eighth-grader was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he died less than an hour later.

If police learn that the gun used to kill Tyrin belonged to his friend's mother, she could face charges for failing to keep the weapon in a secure location.

Speaking to a Washington Post reporter outside the apartment building, a heartbroken Tyrone Celey said he feels like he failed because he could not keep his son safe.

Last words: Tyrin's father rushed to his side and heard the teen say, 'Daddy, hurt' over and over again 

Forgiveness: The victim's father said he doesn't want any charges to be brought against the 14-year-old, who was inseparable friends with his son (pictured left and right) 

The father won custody of Tyrin only last year after a protracted and bitter custody battle with the boy's mother.

Celey described his son and the 14-year-old boy as inseparable friends who were always seen together.

The boys stayed indoors most of the time playing video games to avoid the drug dealers peddling their product on the street.

Tyrin's father recalled that when he rushed up to the third-floor apartment and found his son lying mortally wounded on the floor, his friend was crying and told him he did not mean to fire the shot.
