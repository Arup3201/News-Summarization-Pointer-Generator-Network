It might still be November but Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is already in the Christmas spirit.

The 29-year-old took to Instagram on Friday to share a picture of himself and son Cristiano Junior posing in front of a Christmas tree, despite the big day being over a month away.

Ronaldo, who will line up for Carlo Ancelotti's side against Eibar on Saturday, is clearly a big fan of the festive period, declaring: 'Christmas time has arrived.'

The Portuguese will be hoping to receive an extra special present in the New Year when he attends the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich on January 12.

And Ronaldo, who is the current holder and favourite for the award, has been backed to retain his crown by his famous namesake.

Former Barcelona and Brazil striker Ronaldo told Sky Sports Italia: 'I think we’ll see a repeat and Ronaldo will win it again this year. He’s scoring lots of goals and is a big part of the way Real Madrid are playing.

'Messi is also in good form but Cristiano’s year has been memorable. Messi’s year hasn't been that memorable for him.'

Other star names bidding to be named the world's best player include Chelsea's Eden Hazard, PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo's Real team-mates Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Sergio Ramos and Karim Benzema.
