The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have given their approval to the first ever royal christening coins created in the UK.

The special coins, which have been produced by the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales, go on sale today to mark the christening of the couple's son, Prince George.

The design features the Lily Font from the Tower of London and two harp-playing cherubs.

The coin worth £50,000, which has been struck to commemorate the christening of Prince George of Cambridge at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales

At the foot of the coin is the royal motto "Dieu et mon droit" - God and my right.

The £5 coin is available in silver - because the crossing of a baby's palm with silver is said to confer good health and prosperity to newborns - and gold - to commemorate the royal celebration.

William and Kate's son will be christened at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace on October 23.

Dr Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said: "I think the designer, John Bergdahl, has done an excellent job of giving us something that is timeless. It's symbolic and it's got dignity about it.

Both sides of the £50,000 coin, which is part of the first ever set of British coins to commemorate a royal christening was revealed today. The new coins, to celebrate the christening of HRH Prince George of Cambridge, have gone into production at The Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales

"Working that out and pitching it at the right level isn't an easy thing to do.

"We've had to bring the royal couple along with us on this. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been involved in the approval of the theme."

Dr Clancy added: "They have considered it to be a good design for the subject. You don't necessarily get a huge amount of detail beyond that. But that they like it is good enough for us."

He said the Queen and Chancellor George Osborne had also given the design their approval.

Approved by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Her Majesty the Queen and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the coins feature the lily font that plays an important role in Royal christenings

Mr Bergdahl said: "The design is baroque, a style that has been reborn many times and often featured in royal artwork and traditions.

"One element that I knew I wanted to incorporate was the Lily Font from the Tower of London, which is a strong tradition in christenings for the Royal Family.

"The motto is traditional and sums up the expectation carried by a young child, born to reign - regardless of gender - for the first time ever."

Mr Bergdahl said it normally takes up to two years to produce a new coin, but the christening edition had to be made in around seven months because of the unknown details about the royal baby, such as its gender or name.

"Hopefully it will be timeless and it will still look as good in 100 years' time as it does now," he added.

The limited edition gold "kilo coin" is being sold for £50,000 but a more affordable "Brilliant Uncirculated" coin costs £13.

The Royal Mint said it has received thousands of pre-orders from within the UK and around the world.
