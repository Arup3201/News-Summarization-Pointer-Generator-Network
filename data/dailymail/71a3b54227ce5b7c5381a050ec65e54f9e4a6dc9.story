A young Celtic fan with Down's syndrome is set to win Scotland Goal of the Month after taking a penalty  for his team last month.

Jay Beatty of Armagh had captured the hearts of football fans everywhere after he was plucked from the crowd by former Hoops striker Georgios Samaras to join in last year's title winning celebrations.

And last month, the fan known as 'Wee Jay' was given a day he will never forget after he was invited to the Celtic's match against Hamilton at New Douglas Park on January 19. 

Jay had given his beloved team a pre-match team talk before scoring a half-time goal on the pitch to rapturous applause.

11-year-old Jay Beatty celebrates after scoring during a half-time penalty shootout challenge between his favourite team Celtics and Hamilton

Thousands have watched the incredible moment when the youngster steps up to take the kick and manages to get it past the keeper and hit the back of the net. The delighted Jay then celebrates with a victory lap as fans from both team went wild.

The 11-year-old and his goal have now been entered into the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) Goal of the Month competition where he faces stiff competition from the likes of Celtic's Mikael Lustig, Aberdeen's David Goodwillie and Partick Thistle's Kris Doolan.

Despite losing 2-0, Hamilton had the good grace to include Beatty's strike in their final score, announcing it as 3-0 to Celtic on Twitter. 

Since Samaras picked him out of the crowd during Celtic's title-winning celebrations, Jay has become a household name among football fans, and was even taken to the World Cup in Brazil last summer by the Greece national team after making friends with   his favourite striker.

Samaras, who has since left the club and currently plays for Saudi side Al Hilal on loan, said: 'This boy gives me so much strength, it's incredible.'

'There are no words. I feel his love so much. This love I feel is also felt by many people in Greece.' 

Last month he was invited to be a VIP guest at the Hamilton Accies v Celtic Premiership match where he scored a goal in front of thousands of fans. 

The Irish Independent reported that Hamilton later told Jay that his goal stood and the final scoreline was 3-0 to Celtic. 

Fans at the game reportedly began chanting 'We love you Jay, we do' and 'There's only one Jay Beatty' after his incredible goal. 

His father told the Scotsma:  'Today was something else and to have a whole stadium including the Hamilton fans chanting your son's name will live with me forever.

'Because of his love of the greatest club in the world, his life has become a dream come true. We thought 2014 was just amazing but today was something else.'

On Facebook his football skills have received high praise with Lauren Burton writing: 'Awww, that's amazing! What a goal! What a bhoy!'

And Joe Harty wrote: 'On you go jay Bhoy.'
