A British tourist has been stranded in a Spanish hospital for 11 days because there were no available NHS beds available in the UK.

Retired Chris Carr, 62, from Melksham, Wiltshire, was visiting Benidorm as part of a four-month caravan trip with his wife Sally, 59, when he was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains.

Spanish doctors found he is suffering from a diaphragmatic hernia which is causing a huge twist in his stomach, and said he needed an operation in the UK where he would get the necessary post-operative care.

But when his medical insurance company rang three hospitals near his home they were told there were no free beds.

The couple's concerned friends rallied round and launched a campaign, putting pressure on the hospitals and getting support from their local MP.

Mr Carr, who is still currently in Spain, has finally been offered a bed at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset, and is due to fly home tomorrow.

But after 11 days of not knowing, Mrs Carr, a retired NHS midwife, said: 'I feel extremely angry - I was furious when we were told about there being no beds.

Mr Carr's insurers phoned three hospitals near his home: Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital (pictured) and Swindon's Great Western Hospital - but all said there were no beds available for him

'We've both worked hard all our lives and paid our taxes.

'Chris worked at the university for 35 years or more and I was a midwife for the NHS for 40 years.

'We've paid our taxes all this time and then for this to happen - I was so frustrated.'

Speaking from Spain, she added: 'We had all the proper insurance - which isn't cheap - so it should have been seamless all the way through.

'But while the care here has been brilliant, it is back in the UK where there has been all the trouble.'

He is suffering from a diaphragmatic hernia which is causing a huge and painful twist in his stomach

Former university IT worker Mr Carr travelled to Spain with his wife as part of a four-month group trip with the Camping and Caravanning Club in January.

He began to feel unwell on February 14 after a meal out and after suffering extreme vomiting went to Hospital Marina Baixa, where he was diagnosed with food poisoning.

He returned to his caravan with tablets but when his stomach swelled to four times its normal size he returned and was instantly seen by worried doctors.

They diagnosed the hernia on his diaphragm which had caused his stomach to swell and twist, leaving him in agony.

Doctors told the Carrs he needed an operation to remove part - if not all - of his stomach and due to potential left-over damage and the need for top-class post-operative care, the operation should happen in the UK.

Mrs Carr said the insurers who work with the Camping and Caravanning Club phoned three hospitals near his home - Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital and Swindon's Great Western Hospital - but all said there were no beds free.

'We couldn't believe it,' said Mrs Carr. 'Bristol said no, Bath said no, Swindon said no.

'They said they had a duty of care to the patients they already had, and there were no beds anyway. We couldn't believe it.

'There was talk of just flying back and dumping ourselves in the nearest A and E, but we would effectively then be health tourists in our own country, and that didn't seem right.'

When Mr Carr's insurance company rang hospitals near his home they were told there were no free beds

Friends and family launched the Get Chris Home campaign on Sunday, urging hospitals to change their mind and recruiting the support of Chippenham MP Duncan Hames.

Yesterday Mrs Carr received a call from insurers to say Bath's RUH had now changed its mind and Mr Carr is due to fly home tomorrow via air ambulance for his operation.

Mrs Carr said: 'It is thanks to the support of our friends and we are so relieved.' 

Speaking from his hospital bed in Benidorm today Mr Carr said he felt abandoned by his own country.

He said: 'It is sad and disappointing that this has happened, the fact that your own country won't help you.

'It is a horrible, horrible situation to be in.' 

'To have to resort to a social media campaign and involve your MP - it's not something we thought we would have to do.

'It's quite upsetting. The nurses here have said to us that they thought our country was rich - they can't believe it.'

Mr Carr's travel insurers Aria Assistance called in medical company Intana to try and help find a hospital bed in England.

An Intana spokeswoman said their assistance team spoke with Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital and Swindon's Great Western Hospital.

She said: 'In arranging Mr Carr's repatriation to the UK we have been in dialogue with a number of treating hospitals within the region to ensure his admission to the appropriate facility for his medical needs.

'As Mr Carr's condition was subject to a degree of change during this time we experienced some difficulty in ascertaining which of these hospitals was able to accept Mr Carr based on the level of specialist care he was likely to require.

'We will never undertake any type of repatriation without having the patient's admission to the correct medical facility arranged and confirmed.

Mr Carr in the Benidorm hospital where he has stayed for the last 11 days - he will return to the UK tomorrow

'As with most medical conditions, Mr Carr's condition has evolved during this time and yesterday we received confirmation from one of these hospitals that, based on his current condition, they would be able to administer his medical treatment.

'During this time we have been in regular contact with the Carr family to keep them abreast of the situation.'

But all three hospitals have today denied speaking to anybody about Mr Carr.

The Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Our records show that we have not been contacted by any hospital in Spain relating to a patient repatriation.'

The University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We will always try to accommodate patients who fall ill abroad as best we can and consider each case on an individual basis.

'We have checked our records, and to the best of our knowledge we have not had any contact from Mr Carr or his insurance company.'

The Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We had no record of being contacted with regard to admitting Mr Christopher Carr for treatment here.

'The Trust regularly receives repatriation requests for which we have clear processes in place; once the details of who, when and where are received, we plan for their arrival in the same way that we would for any other hospital admission.

'We have now received Mr Carr's referral for treatment and we are preparing for his arrival.'
