Radamel Falcao will be at 'one of the best teams in the world' next season if Manchester United do not sign the Colombia striker. 

The 28-year-old has struggled since joining Louis van Gaal's side on loan, starting just eight games and scoring three goals, and there are doubts if United will make his £6million loan move permanent.

But Falcao's agent Jorge Mendes says he will leave Monaco this summer for a top team.

'He is a very good player, the Manchester United fans have a fantastic player,' Mendes told Sky Sports Italia.

'He could play in any team, anything could happen. One hundred per cent, he will be at one of the best teams in the world, if it's United or not. But time is needed, we'll see what happens.'

Falcao was left out of United's squad for the 1-0 defeat by Southampton at Old Trafford on Sunday but is expected to return to the starting line-up this weekend against QPR after Robin van Persie picked up an ankle injury.
