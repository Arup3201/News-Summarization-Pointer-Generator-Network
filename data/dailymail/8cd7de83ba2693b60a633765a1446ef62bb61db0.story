SIr Philip Green could be in line for a £250million windfall by selling a stake in his Topshop and Topman business to Americans.

The retail tycoon is in talks to sell a 25 per cent stake in the fashion chain which is valued by experts at around £1billion.

Sir Philip’s family is already estimated to be worth more than £3billion.

It is thought that Sir Philip wants to raise the money by selling a slice of Topshop to expand the chain into China and the US, where he already has flagship stores in three cities.

Topshop and Topman have become one of the biggest successes on the UK high street, partly as a result of a lucrative collaboration with supermodel Kate Moss who designed her own clothing collection for the store.

The launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading Topshop.com had ever seen.

The chain has also been hailed for  its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to  its shelves.

The business has 615 franchised  outlets operating in 39 countries. If  the new deal is successful it could transform Topshop into a truly  global brand.

A friend of the tycoon said: ‘You would be wrong to suggest Sir Philip is going to use this deal to take cash out of the business. This is about investing in a big push for Topshop and Topman internationally.’

The American buyer is thought  to be Leonard Green & Partners  which, with Texas Pacific Group, is one of the backers of America’s J. Crew retail chain.

Sir Philip is expected to conclude discussions today and make an announcement tomorrow.

The landmark deal – Sir Philip’s biggest since his failed approach to Marks & Spencer in 2004 – would provide him with partners who know the US retail market and could help with any expansion plans. Topshop and Topman are the most profitable parts of Sir Philip’s Arcadia empire, which he bought for £800million in 2002 and which includes BHS, Evans and Burton.

He is now ranked with his family at number 17 on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated fortune of £3.3billion.

Topshop started as Peter Robinson's Topshop in Sheffield in 1964, becoming a stand-alone shop in the 1970s

Investment: The retail tycoon is thought to want to raise the money to expand his fashion chain into China and the U.S.

Last month he signed up American 
reality TV stars the Kardashian sisters in an attempt to boost the 
fortunes of his Dorothy Perkins chain.

The entrepreneur recently criticised 
Britain’s battered retailers for feeling sorry for themselves, saying 
there was ‘no use moping about’ and they should ‘get on with it’.

But he has faced criticism himself over his tax arrangements.

Sir Philip, who employs 45,000 people through Arcadia, says he always pays his tax in full.

Topshop started life in 1964 as Peter Robinson’s Top Shop, a fashion brand within the Sheffield branch of the Peter Robinson chain.

By the 1970s Topshop had become  a stand-alone store, and in 1994 it  settled into its permanent home, 214 Oxford Street.

Sir Philip is already in New York with his Topshop brand, and he opened two more flagship stores, in Chicago and Las Vegas, in September 2011 and March 2012 respectively.

He has a fourth store due to open in Los Angeles next spring.
