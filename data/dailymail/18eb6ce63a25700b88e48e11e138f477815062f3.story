Conservative councils have made seven times as many applications to sell off school playing fields as Labour since the general election, it has emerged.

In the past two years, 30 out of 35 applications to sell playing fields have been made by Tory councils, according to figures unveiled by the Labour Party.

Four applications were made by Labour-run councils and one by a Lib Dem council.

The applications threaten to undermine the central Government’s pledge to give more backing to school sports.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has already come under fire for allowing the sale of school fields on five occasions against the advice of an independent panel in the past 15 months.

And yesterday he faced claims  that he allowed the sale of a playing field in one borough against advice in exchange for its Conservative council funding a free school in the area.

An independent panel last month rejected a call to sell off tennis courts at Elliott School in Putney, in the London borough of Wandsworth, but Mr Gove defied the recommendation.

The school will now be turned into an academy while its operators have received the go-ahead to build a free school in the area.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who is a governor at the school, has also publicly backed the sell-off to ‘provide investment’ in the school.

However, campaigners accused the Government of ‘backroom stitch ups’.

Stephen Twigg, shadow education secretary,  said: ‘There is clearly a very cosy relationship between Michael Gove and Tory Councils. 

‘The Tory Council applies to sell off their school playing fields, and Michael Gove gives it the nod – often flying in the face of real concerns from the independent school playing field panel.

‘These figures show the effect a Tory Council can have. 

‘It flies in the face of the assurances that David Cameron made about our Olympic legacy.’ 

Mr Twigg added that schools resorted to selling their fields because the Government had cut its schools capital budget by two thirds, leaving many desperate for funds for essential repairs.

But a Government source said: ‘This is just the usual hypocrisy from Labour. 

‘Labour sold off over 200 playing fields, including dozens when Stephen Twigg was a Schools minister. 

‘The bottom line is that this Government has only approved sales if the school has closed, has merged, or if equal or better facilities are being put in their place.’ 

Pressure on ministers intensified at the weekend as the outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association said private schools should share playing fields with state schools in exchange for their tax breaks. 

Lord Colin Moynihan suggested that sharing playing fields should be part of the ‘public benefit’ test which they have to meet to get tax breaks worth £100million a year.

The former sports minister and retired silver medallist rower said: ‘State secondary schools with good sports facilities, as well as all independent schools, should be required to share their facilities and co-operate with the primary schools in their catchment areas.’ 

He added: ‘For the independent schools, this could be part of the public benefit requirement under the Charities Act.’

The Government’s commitment to sports has been called into question after ministers revealed that they had approved 31 school playing field sell-offs since the general election – ten more than previously disclosed.

Even playing fields at the former schools of Olympians have been sold off.

Dani King, a gold-medal winning cyclist, has revealed her dismay that her old school, Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, had sold off its football pitch to a housing developer.

The 21-year-old said: ‘When I was at school I used to do lots on the playing fields. We used them for PE and I would do athletics and running at the after-school club. 

‘Playing fields are training venues for future Olympians.’ 

A Department for Education spokesman declined to comment on Lord Moynihan’s suggestions.

Commenting on the case of Elliott school, he said: ‘Elliott wants to enhance its academic and sporting provision. Its sporting facilities are dilapidated and out of date. The Government approved the application.’
