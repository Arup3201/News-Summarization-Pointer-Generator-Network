The long-awaited statue of Joe Frazier is fast approaching completion.

The figure of Smokin’ Joe poised in the split second after landing the booming left with which he floored Muhammad Ali on his way to winning the Fight Of The Century stands nine-feet tall in the studio of sculptor Stephen Layne.

It is now beginning the five-month bronzing procedure prior to an unveiling in Frazier’s home city of Philadelphia next April.

A campaign for the real former world heavyweight champion to be thus immortalised followed the erection in Philadelphia of a statue of celluloid boxer Sylvester Stallone.

Civil Rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson said: ‘Tell them Rocky was fictitious. Joe was reality.’

Several years of fund-raising and political manoeuvring later, that anomaly is about to be corrected.

Project: Sculptor Stephen Layne expects the Frazier statue to be ready in April and it will stand in Philadelphia

The process was tragically interrupted when the original sculptor died suddenly, Layne, the runner-up in that selection process, took over, admitting that he feels ‘the artistic pressure to create the best piece I can put out there.’

So powerful and commanding is the result that one of Frazier’s daughters was moved to weep when invited to see that statue.

No doubt there will be more tears for the late Smokin’ Joe when he takes his eternal place on the site of the old Spectrum arena which he christened with his 1967 victory over Tony Doyle.
