One Korean food market in Glendale, California has enforced a heated new rule--customers may only purchase one bottle of the Sriracha each.

Laist reports that HK Market is limiting Sriracha to one bottle per person because they are afraid they'll run out. Now that the quantity of the sweet and spicy chili sauce is growing less after the factory was partially shut down, demand for Sriracha is on the rise.

Irwindale, California residents complained that the Sriracha Factory in their area created a spicy air that made their eyes burn, gave them coughing fits and headaches. The smell was such a 'nuisance' that Judge Robert O'Brien ordered Huy Fong Foods, Inc. to partially shut down their factory for the time being earlier this month.

Now, customers are ravenous for the popular chili sauce.

'1 each' reads a sign on the Sriracha tubs HK market sells for $3.99 per container. Laist spoke with HK market earlier this morning to ask why they are rationing the Sriracha, and an employee said that they are 'afraid of running out.'

The term, 'Sirachapocalypse' has become a popular term for the growing demand for Sriracha in the wake of the factory shutdown.

On social media sites like twitter and instagram, 'Sirachapocolypse' has been deemed a concern among young 'hipsters' and possesses a kitsch value that's be come increasingly popular over time.

Publications like Quartz have called Sriracha the 'coolest hot-sauce of all time' and pointed out the fact that Sriracha doesn't pay one cent on advertising their brand.

Sriracha is 'too cool' for twitter, facebook page, or google plus--something that people on all of those media sites find alluring.

Laist reports that Huy Fong started in Chinatown in 1980 but that he sold $60 million worth of hot sauce last year alone.

The San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports that Sriracha supporters like restauranteur Eric Greenspan said, 'I don't see Sriracha disappearing.'

Gabriel believes that the disappearance will help to boost the brand. 'I dont think anything's goig to stop their momentum,' he said. 'It's too darn hot.'

Sriracha has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially among the 'hipster' population

The Sriracha company had previously argued that there is no reason to close the plant now because harvest season and subsequent grinding of red-hot Jalapeno peppers, the sauce's key ingredient, has passed.

That suggests that the injunction may not have a major immediate effect on the company's production or the nation's hot sauce supply as Huy Fong keeps up its year-round mixing and bottling.

The judge acknowledged there was a 'lack of credible evidence' linking locals' complaints of breathing trouble and watering eyes to the factory. But he said the odor that could be 'reasonably inferred to be emanating from the facility' is, for residents, 'extremely annoying, irritating and offensive to the senses warranting consideration as a public nuisance.'

Irwindale officials commended the decision.

'We believe it's a strong ruling that acknowledges and is reflective of the concerns that the community has raised about the health impacts of the odor,'City Attorney Fred Galante said.

The case could still go to trial, but Galante said the city would like to see a settlement outside court, and does not want to shut down Sriracha altogether.

'We're going to try to keep having a conversation with Huy Fong,' Galante said, and hopes to find a collaborative way to 'make sure the odor problems are addressed.'
