They are aiming to follow in the footsteps of the Spice
Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix by setting the music charts alight.

But this is a girlband with a difference - for all five
members are schoolgirls who have fathers who have risked their lives in the
Armed Forces.

The group - called the Poppy Girls - was formed after an X
Factor-style talent competition for the children of military families run by
the Royal British Legion.

The singers - Megan Adams, 10, Florence Ransom, 10, Alice
Milburn, 13, Bethany Davey, 15, and Charlotte Mellor, 17 - battled their way
past more than 1,000 other hopefuls to make it into the group.

Poppy Girls: Megan Adams, 10, Charlotte Mellor, 17, Alice Milburn, 13, Florence Ransom, 10, and Bethany Davey, 15, sing a 'hauntingly beautiful' track for this year's remembrance day. The song is by singer Regina Spektor

Now they are hoping to wow an army of fans and crash into
the Top Ten with the official 2013 Poppy Appeal single.

The song, The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye), will help raise
£80million a year to support military personnel and their families.

Written by acclaimed American singer-songwriter Regina
Spektor, the lyrics are a poignant message of hope for those who will
not see their loved ones for weeks or months.

The Poppy Girls will perform the single in front of the
Queen at the Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert
Hall on Saturday, November 9. The song will then be released the following day.

The girls were selected after an exhaustive global search
for talent among Forces families, overseen by executives at Decca Records..

Children who had a parent or sibling serving in the UK or
overseas were allowed to enter the contest.

More than 1,000 children from places as far away as the
Falkland Islands and Kuwait, took part. Some had experienced the heartbreak of
having loved ones killed or injured on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Praise: Dickon Stainer, president of Decca 
Records, praised the
girls' 'hard work, discipline and dedication'. (Clockwise from top left)

The competitors were whittled down to 60 for the 'live'
auditions and reduced again to 11 for the final. They went into the studio for
a gruelling selection process which led to the creation of the Poppy Girls.

Megan, from Stirling, Scotland, began singing lessons just a
year ago. Her father, Lieutenant Commander William Adams, is on a six-month
deployment in the Indian Ocean.

Florence, from Peterfield, Hampshire, whose father
Lieutenant Ben Ransom, serves in the Navy is emulating her mother, who enjoyed
phenomenal success as part of the Military Wives Choir, which reached Number
One with the song Wherever You Are at Christmas 2011.

Alice, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, has a father, Captain
Philip Milburn, in the Navy, while Bethany, from Dartford, Kent, was separated
from her dad Dean while he was deployed in warzones with the 9th/12th Royal
Lancers.

Charlotte, at boarding school in Cambridge, has lived in
eight different places in her short life as her father Wing Commander Paul
Mellor is a padre in the RAF who recently returned from a tour-of-duty in the
Gulf.

Charles Byrne, the Royal British Legion's head of
fundraising, said: 'This is a hauntingly beautiful track sung by a group of
girls who know what it means to have family members constantly placed in harm's
way.

Perform: The girls will perform their single for the Queen on November 9 - the day before it is released in shops

They were formed by an X Factor-style contest for children of military families run by the Royal British Legion

'The major theme of this year's Poppy Appeal is around
families. There is no more powerful way of reflecting that than through the
voices of these exceptionally talented young people.'

Dickon Stainer, president of Decca Records, praised the
girls' 'hard work, discipline and dedication'.

He said: 'When you hear these young kids talk about their
families and the sacrifices they make growing up in a Forces family, you do
wonder how such young shoulders can carry the burden of the constant stress and
anxiety.'
