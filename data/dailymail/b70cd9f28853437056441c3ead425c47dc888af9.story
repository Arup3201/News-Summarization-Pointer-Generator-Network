A house fire which killed a doctor and four of her children may have been started by arsonists targeting a 'gangster-type' tenant who used to live at the property, neighbours believe.

Sabah Usmani, 44, and her children Hira, 12, Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, died on Monday after fire ripped through their home in Harlow, Essex.

Detectives are investigating the possibility that they were the victims of mistaken identity, and today nearby residents claimed that the culprits had probably targeted someone else.

Blaze: Sabah Usmani, her sons Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, and her 12-year-old daughter Hira, died when fire ripped through their Essex home. Neighbours believe they were the victims of mistaken identity

Tragic: Essex Police initially suspected an arson attack but it is now thought that the fire was a tragic accident

Chris Day, 48, who lives in a flat 
next door, described a former tenant whom he and other neighbours 
believe may have been the intended victim.

He said: 'This guy looked like a proper dodgy bloke and he had a bull mastiff that he used to walk around the neighbourhood.

'He looked like a gangster type - the
 kind of person you wouldn’t want to cross. I think he was a cage 
fighter - he certainly was that build.

'He used to argue with his partner all the time and I could hear them from across the street.

'I’ve been told he dealt drugs which 
would make sense as I used to see dodgy people go in and out of the 
house all the time when this guy lived there about a year or two ago.

'When I saw the fire I thought this must have been a revenge attack that went wrong.

'Maybe this guy owed someone money and they came to the house not knowing he’d moved.'

Miss Usmani, who was a qualified 
doctor, her husband Abdul Shakoor and their five children moved to the 
rented house a year ago from Winchester, Hampshire.

The family were originally from Pakistan but moved to the UK in 2009.

Dr Shakoor, 45, an endocrinologist and hospital registrar, suffered severe smoke inhalation as he fought to save his family.

He was transferred from the Princess 
Alexandra Hospital in Harlow to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford to be 
close to his only surviving daughter, Maheen, three, who is in a 
critical condition at a specialist burns unit.

Mr Day said: 'I’m sure whoever did this did not know that family lived there.

'It seems like a case of mistaken identity - it’s innocent people being killed because of drugs yet again.'

Mr Day described the former tenant, 
who is believed to have rented the property shortly before the Shakoor 
family moved in, as a large bald-headed white man.

He claimed that the man lived at the home for around 10 months before moving out.

Mr Day's comments came after inquests into the deaths were opened and adjourned at Chelmsford Coroner's Court.

The short hearing was told that the 
bodies of all five members of the family had been released and a funeral
 could be held in days.

Coroner’s officer Laura Howarde 
confirmed that Dr Shakoor had been through the heartbreaking task of 
confirming the identity of the five dead members of his beloved family.

Deputy coroner’s officer, Eleanor 
McGann, said it had been a 'terrible fire' and asked for her sympathy to
 be passed on to Dr Shakoor.

A hospital spokesman said there had been 'no real change in the condition' of either Dr Shakoor or his daughter Maheen.

Dr Shakoor's friend Abdul Khaliq, a 
taxi driver, said the father had spoken of moving the family out of 
their rented house to a permanent address elsewhere in Harlow.

Mr Khaliq said: 'He had spoken at the mosque about how he would like to buy a house in the area.

'He planned to settle down in Harlow.'

Mr Khaliq said that he saw Dr Shakoor only hours before the blaze as they prayed at the Harlow Islamic Centre on Sunday evening.

He added: “That evening I was sitting and praying with him and his children.

'He was a regular at the mosque with his family who were always very well behaved.

'He shook my hand before he left. It is a complete mystery why this has happened.

'We pray five times a day and every time we are praying for him and his family.'

Harlow Council is to open a book of condolence at its civic centre on Thursday for residents to pay their respects.

Speaking at the scene of the fire on 
Tuesday, Chief Superintendent Luke Collison, of Essex Police, said: ‘I’m
 convinced the answer to this serious crime lies in the community.

'If anyone has noticed anything suspicious we would ask them to come forward.

'There is nothing to suggest we are dealing with a serial arsonist.'

Asked about other incidents of arson 
in the area, such as two abandoned cars set alight in a nearby street, 
he said: 'This house fire has a different MO [modus operandi].

'The other fires are not untypical for such a town and we would class them as minor.'

Although a racial motivation for the 
attack has not been ruled out, Chief Supt Collison said there was no 
evidence to support it.
