It's only two weeks since Roberto Di Matteo was appointed as Schalke manager, but he looks to already have instilled some of the team spirit that brought him the Champions League trophy on his last appearance on this stage.

While Didier Drogba was reliving 2012's Champions League final with a penalty to mark his first goal back at Chelsea, his former manager was guiding Group G rivals Schalke to a vital 4-3 win over Sporting Lisbon.

Di Matteo was embraced by Chinedu Obasi after the Nigerian scored the German club's first and the boss celebrated on the touchline while Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Benedikt Hoewedes and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting scored to give Schalke their first win in this year's competition.

Manchester United loanee Nani scored Sporting's first before Adrien Silva scored twice but Schalke ran out winners with Choupo-Moting's 90th minute penalty.

Shakhtar Donetsk put their domestic problems behind them with a brilliant 7-0 win away at BATE Borisov in Group H, with striker Luiz Adriano scoring a record five goals in Belarus.

Also in that group, Porto saw off Athletic Bilbao courtesy of Ricardo Quaresma's winner 15 minutes from time.
