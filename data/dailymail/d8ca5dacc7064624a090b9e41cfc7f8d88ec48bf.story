Tempers flared and tears were shed as several people collapsed in an overcrowded New Jersey train station while waiting in long lines to get to the Super Bowl.

Emergency medical workers pushed their way through the overheated, angry crowd to treat collapsed would-be Super Bowl revelers at Secaucus Junction on Sunday afternoon only hours before the big game.

Long lines were brought to a standstill by temporarily installed airport-style security machines that failed to keep up with the volume of passengers taking transit to the Super Bowl as authorities had instructed.

Jame packed: Football fans make their way to trains at Secaucus station in New Jersey where several people collapsed

Long lines have come to a standstill in front of airport-style security machines that apparently cannot handle the crowd volume. People were squeezed together in an enclosed stairwell.

Brrr: The temperature for tonight's game is expected to be about 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit

'Absolutely pathetic, the NFL had 40,000 people coming on buses, they knew there was going to be 45,000 people coming out,' Tammy Ritchie, from Vancouver, Canada, told the Star-Ledger. 'We stood in line sweating, it’s absolute horse crap.

As more trains arrived, police tried to thin the sweating, jostling crowd by spreading people across the platform.

Initial fan calls of "Seahawks" and "Broncos" gave way to angry shouts of 'New Jersey, your Super Bowl sucks!'

Law
 enforcement officials in New York and New Jersey have ramped up 
security in anticipation of Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford on 
Sunday, utilizing just about everything in their arsenals - including 
sharp-shooting snipers - to protect those in attendance from any 
possible terrorist attack.

'We were stuck in the tunnel for 30 minutes, it was probably 120 degrees,' said Jeff Dunbar, from Seattle. ‘People had to take their shirts off, it was not good... people were chanting ‘Jersey sucks’ and blaming Christie.'

Adding to the confusion was the lack of communication between authorities and passengers.

'Nobody is telling anybody what’s going on...people are getting sick, they’re feeling claustrophobic, there’s no air in there, there’s no water,' said Bob Dowling, of New Providence, New Jersey. 'the wait is incredible, we were back there a good one hour and fifteen minutes.'

The
 Super Bowl is what national security officials consider a 'level one 
national security event' and may be a target for terrorists because of 
the level of attention paid to the game. The added security proved to be too much for many in the crowd to handle.

'It was 120 degrees in there with no air conditioning, everybody is drenched,' said Dave Mannon, of Dallas, Texas. 'They even had to send in medics because a few people passed out... I don’t think it’s working, I think Governor Christie’s at it again.'

The added security measures also include high-altitude snipers working with security agents on the ground to make sure everyone is safe.

If you have an active shooter or you have anyone who may have a bomb. 
Snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually
 hit that target. It’s an entire team that communicates. You have 
individuals who are at high altitudes inside the arena and then you have
 individuals that are on the ground moving in and around the crowd,' former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam tells Fox News.

Additionally, security officials are reviewing recent terrorist attacks in other countries to determine how to prevent them from happening in the U.S.

'Certainly, we're keeping an eye on activities around the world, but as of this time, there are no threats directed against this event that we're aware of,' New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said a security briefing in Manhattan.

Because this year's Super Bowl has the distinction of relying on mass transit to take up to 30,000 fans to the game, the deadly bombings in the southern Russian city of Volograd have raised worries here, said Col. Rick Fuentes, head of the New Jersey State Police. The suicide attacks on a trolleybus and a train station that killed more than 30 people within weeks of the Winter Olympics also prompted a series of meetings among the planners for Super Bowl security, he said.

Capacity: People already are filing into MetLife Stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey

Target: The Super Bowl is considered by security officials to be a 'level one national security event'

Local officials are counting on the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security 'to keep an eye on and brief us on those events,' Fuentes said. 'There is a concern with mass transit and we've prepared ourselves for it.'

Trains, buses and cars taking fans from New York and parts of New Jersey to the stadium and back again 'are going to be scanned, they're going to be checked, they're going to be swept,' he said.

In Manhattan, the NYPD is drawing on its experience securing the annual New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, the New York City Marathon, the U.N. General Assembly and other high-profile events to secure 'Super Bowl Boulevard,' a 13-block street fair on Broadway.

The department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes police officers to the area. It's also relying on bomb-sniffing dogs, portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras to detect trouble.

In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the NYPD rehearsed its response to a variety of potential threats, including 'the backpack left unsecured scenario,' Bratton said. 'We are very, very well-prepared.'

The state police plan to assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on Sunday, Fuentes said. A security center has been set up in a hollowed-out building across a highway from the stadium that's slated to become a mammoth retail and entertainment complex.

A 24-hour FBI command center will monitor the latest counterterrorism intelligence, said Aaron Ford, head of the FBI's Newark office. Measures have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there's plenty of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at the game in New Orleans, said Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's head of security.

'This year we're going to try to go blackout free,' Miller said. 'One thing that I've learned is that you don't want to be overconfident. You want to prepare and be ready. You just don't know what you might face on game day.'

Randy Killikevc, a tourist from Tennessee who attended a Super Bowl party in Byrant Park on Wednesday, said possible threats against the Super Bowl weren't on his mind.

'If terrorists were going to strike New York why not do it on New Year's Eve? There's lots more people here (then),' he said.

Security officials consider the Super Bowl a 'level one' security event that could be a potential target for terrorists

The heightened security is not a response to any known threat, it is a precautionary measure to guarantee the public's safety

Security officials have been analyzing terrorist attacks in other countries so they know how to prevent similar attacks in the U.S.
