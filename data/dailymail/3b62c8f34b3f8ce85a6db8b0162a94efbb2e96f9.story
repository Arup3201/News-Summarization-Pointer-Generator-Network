A television news anchor who ended up swearing on a live broadcast has apologized for his ill-timed rant and said his editor was to blame. 

Matt Pieper, who has since been fired from News 12 The Bronx in New York, was caught telling parents to 'do their f***ing jobs' live on air.

He then continued to joke about it for several minutes while insulting anyone who relied on government assistance 'for their entire lives', without realizing his insensitive thoughts were being broadcast for everyone to see and hear.

Incredibly, Mr Pieper then decided to shun responsibility for speaking out loud by blaming the workings of a busy TV newsroom and someone 'speaking in his ear' for his lack of judgement.

Fired: Matt Pieper had a promising and successful career before his self-destruction in front of the cameras. He had been nominatied for an Emmy Award in the past

'Someone in the control room spoke into my earpiece and asked me to relay a message to our reporter out in the field,' Mr Pieper explained on Twitter.

'These were not my own thoughts or profanities,' the news anchor insisted. 'In relaying that information, I made a poor decision in my choice of words and for that I apologize.' 

Mr Pieper went further still writing a grovelling apology on his Facebook profile.

As a professional who has spent his entire career delivering the news, I understand the importance of sharing the facts.The incident was broadcast accidentally when we were supposed to be in a commercial break, not on the air. Someone in the control room spoke into my earpiece and asked me to relay a message to our reporter out in the field.'

'I could have communicated what I was asked to get across in a different manner and under the pressure of doing my job in real time I made a mistake.'

Outspoken: Friends of the former News 12 anchor have told how the journalist would often speak his mind in a blunt manner. He will now have time to do this, face-to-face, rather than over the airwaves

In a Facebook apology, the station blamed a 'technical error' on the airing of the 'personal conversation' 

A story to tell: Matt Pieper has pleaded with friends on his Facebook profile for them to contact him if they want to know the 'full story' as to what happend

I have been a stalwart advocate for equality and diversity in the workplace, within my own family and in my community. I apologize to anyone I offended and assure you that this situation—which has cost me my job—was truly just a mistake in relaying a message, and not a representation of my views or character.' 

Pieper made the inflammatory comments last Wednesday morning during an embarrassing exchange with reporter Amy Yensi. 

Thinking it was a commercial break, Pieper was talking to  reporter Amy Yensi about an up-coming report on school crossing guards when he said: 'Two minutes and Dave [a colleague] wants you to talk about how parents should do their f***ing jobs and take their kids to school and not rely on everyone else, kind of like people who rely on government assistance for their entire lives.'

The other reporter laughs at the joke before Pieper adds: 'It's true, I mean, how old are these kids?'  

The camera kept on recording while the anchor neatened up his tie, completely unaware that his insensitive commetns had been broadcast on air.

The station was later forced to issue an apology on its Facebook page. 

It read: 'As a result of a technical error during a program break this morning, a personal conversation between an anchor and a reporter was unintentionally placed on the air. 

'The conversation included offensive language and inappropriate commentary. News 12 the Bronx deeply regrets that this incident took place.'   

'The remarks of these individuals in no way reflect the views of News 12 management or other News 12 personnel. Steps have been taken to deal with the employees involved and resolve the technical issues. 

'We take this incident extremely seriously and we sincerely apologize to all who may have been offended.'

The Emmy-nominated Pieper, who joined News 12 in 2008, was axed from the company after the remarks, he confirmed in his Twitter post.
