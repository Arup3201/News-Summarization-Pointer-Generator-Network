Sir David Nicholson: He has refused to step down and said the appalling standards of care were due to a 'system failure'

The most powerful man in the NHS refused to quit last night despite presiding over one of Britain’s most appalling hospital scandals.

While relatives of some of the hundreds of patients who died needlessly at Stafford Hospital called for his head, Sir David Nicholson said he was ‘not ashamed’ of his tenure in office.

Sir David, who helped appoint the hospital’s chief executive, revealed he did consider resigning – but decided against it, concluding that the scandal had been caused by a ‘system failure’.

‘When I saw the patients’ stories…there was a moment when I did think about that [resigning], but I was pretty sure that I knew broadly what we had to do,’ he said.

Relatives of victims and MPs lined up to castigate the conclusions by Robert  Francis QC that no one should be scapegoated over the disgrace.

They said Sir David and former Stafford managers should ‘carry the can’ for the Health Service’s abject failure to ensure a proper standard of care at the hospital.

As many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust between 2005 and 2008 with thousands of others subject to ‘inhumane’ and ‘degrading’ treatment.

Sir David has been chief executive of the NHS since 2007, a job which comes with a £270,000 salary. Before that he was chief executive of the West Midlands strategic health authority which had overall responsibility for Mid Staffordshire Trust at the time of the scandal.

The report did criticise the leadership of this authority, which Mr Nicholson headed from 2005 to 2007 – saying it ‘failed to be sufficiently sensitive to signs that patients might be at risk’.

Yesterday, the NHS chief executive conducted a round of interviews. And he told ITV News: ‘I am not ashamed of being in my job today. Clearly I regret incredibly what happened to those patients.

David Cameron said he shared concerns that not one doctor or nurse has been struck off for poor care, or that failing managers are often ‘recycled’ to different parts of the NHS.

But both the Prime Minister and Health 
Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said they had confidence in Sir David’s 
ability to stay in charge. Mr Cameron told the Commons it would be wrong
to ‘scapegoat’ him and said that he had ‘learned the lessons’.

But campaigner Julie Bailey, who lost her mother due to failings at the trust, said: ‘We are asking for the resignation of David Nicholson, because he has presided over this disaster. Somebody must be held to account for these failings.’

The 1,780-page report revealed that doctors at the Mid Staffordshire trust admitted they became ‘immune to the sound of pain’ and patients were routinely abandoned on trolleys on without food or drink. Wards and departments were ‘ruled by fear’.

Yesterday, as Mr Francis delivered his findings, he called for sweeping reforms to the NHS to ensure the mistakes could not be made again, including: 

However, Mr Francis concluded no individual was to blame for the failings. ‘This is not a case where it was ever going to be possible or permissible to find an individual or a group of individuals was to blame for this,’ his report said.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the health select committee, demanded an investigation into claims in the report that Sir David dismissed the complaints of relatives of dead patients as ‘simply lobbying’. Sir David said he has ‘no recollection’ of making the comments.
