Ask Ronald de Boer for his most vivid memories of Louis van Gaal and he is whisked back to De Meer, Ajax’s fabled old training base.

This was Van Gaal’s domain, the setting where Manchester United’s new manager worked his magic; filling his players with confidence, plotting their path to glory and drilling passages of play that would become second nature on match days.

It was also the place where Van Gaal would be fearsome and intimidating. The Dutch coach takes defeat as a personal affront and De Boer witnessed — as well as received — some of his most ferocious criticisms.

Few coaches in football have the ability to be as pugnacious as Van Gaal but De Boer, who played for him at Ajax and Barcelona, says he can make his players run through walls for him. In short, United have a man primed to deliver success.

‘Yes, he can be scary,’ said De Boer. ‘But that is because he is so passionate. He is 100 per cent all the time and he wants the same in return. You could see it on the sidelines but he could be even more intense on a Monday morning, especially if we’d lost.

‘If he knew that you hadn’t played well, he would be straight on top of you. He is a big guy, he wants to win and that is where he can be intimidating and intense. But even if he shouts at you, he will listen to what you have to say.

‘He gives players chances to prove themselves. If you play badly in one game he won’t drop you straight away. He will give you the trust to repay him with a better performance next time. He puts trust in players but he expects it back from them. He doesn’t want to be let down.’

Clearly, you do not win titles in Holland, Spain and Germany if your only attribute is being able to shout and De Boer — key to the Ajax side which Van Gaal steered to Champions League success in 1995 — has given an insight into his old manager’s forensic attention to detail.

‘He would say sometimes to Marc Overmars, “The guy you are playing against drifts across to be close to the central defender. Stay where you are and you will get in behind him,” — and he’d be right,’ said De Boer.

‘It was the same with Jari Litmanen. “Jari, the defender who is marking you sometimes thinks he is a holding midfielder also. Don’t move when he does. Let him go five yards.” Jari would do that, the chance would come and he’d score. It was like he was seeing things before anyone else.

‘He is so well prepared that you would be doing drills in training and you would know what the opposition were going to do before they did. You knew exactly what you were up against.’

So how will he inspire, for example, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney after last season when they so often misfired alongside each other?

‘He has got some great players there,’ observed De Boer, who was capped 67 times by Holland. ‘He wants them to be excellent in everything they do. If you do it the way he wants he will be your best mate.’
