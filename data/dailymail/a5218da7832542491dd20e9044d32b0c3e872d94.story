Murder victim: Leroy James, pictured aged nine, bled to death from a single stab wound after a playground fight

A boy of 14 was stabbed to death only 500 yards from a police station which was busy preparing for closure.

Leroy James died in front of friends on a sunny afternoon following a playground argument.

But as the teenager lay slumped against a wall in a pool of blood, officers were packing up their belongings at the station, which is being shut as part of cutbacks.

If the officers had not been preparing to leave, at least some of them are likely to have been on patrol in Enfield, North London.

Last night a local officer admitted that the station's closure meant officers had been 'distracted'.

He said: 'It is a tragedy, but it is even more tragic that he was killed so close to a police station.

'That station was already in its transition phase for closure.

'It was working at half mast and the offices had been stripped bare.

'It is inevitable that the cuts will have an impact on our ability to police these communities. This is an example.

'Some of the police officers might have been out on the streets policing rather than busy packing if it was not being closed.'

Leroy was killed on a basketball court at Ponders End Recreation Ground, in Enfield, North London, on Wednesday afternoon as children as young as nine played close by.

A post-mortem found the schoolboy died from a single stab wound. Last night two boys, aged 14 and 15, were last night arrested on suspicion of his murder.

Leroy was the youngest of ten teenagers killed in the capital this year.

The nearby A10 retail park, 
including a branch of Tesco, suffered extensive looting during the 
rioting last week.

Five
officers are still based at the police station, located opposite the 
recreation ground, which serves as a main meeting point for teenagers in
the neighbourhood.

By 
tomorrow, the station will have closed altogether.

It has not been open 
to the public for some time but is a base for neighbourhood patrols. 
Instead, officers will occupy desks in council buildings or shops.

Yesterday, residents said the neighbourhood was rife with gangs who 'have got no fear any more'.

10. August 17: Leroy James, 14, knifed to death in Enfield

One
theory is Leroy was killed thanks to a 'territorial gang' dispute, 
which meant a boy from Edmonton, with an N9 postcode, should not have 
been 'hanging in EN3'.

Roxy Bagun, 19, who lives next to the park, said: 'They had the guts to do it right in front of a police station.'

Last night Leroy's heartbroken father, also called Leroy James, suggested that his son my have been lured to his death.

He
said his son's friends had used the BlackBerry Messenger instant 
messenging service to invite him to the park on Wednesday afternoon.

Mr James, 41, said: 'I know they were sending BlackBerry messages yesterday telling him to come to the park.'

The
scrap metal worker choked back tears as he said: 'He was my only son. I
am just trying to keep the faith at the moment. He was funny, always 
playing jokes.'

Mr James insisted Leroy, a keen footballer, had always steered clear of gangs and never carried a knife.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode said officers had 'no intelligence' that the killing was gang-related.

She
said he was in the park with half a dozen friends when he got into 'an 
altercation' with at least one other boy and was stabbed to death.
