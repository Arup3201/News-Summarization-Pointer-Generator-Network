Arrrgh! Last time I looked there were plenty of shopping days till Christmas… Now there are just three days to go and I still have friends and family to buy for!

Rather than slogging around the shops, desperately grabbing whatever’s left on the shelves, I’m going to sit at home with a cuppa and finish off my present-buying online. 

Luckily, Escentual.com offer Christmas shipping right up until 1pm on December 23rd - so let’s go shopping…

For Marvellous Mums

For mums who like the finer things in life (that’s you, Mummy F), Givenchy Prisme Libre Enhanced Radiance Loose Powder is a true make-up treat. 

The ultra-luxurious loose powder is a mix of four complementary, complexion-enhancing shades that blend together to create a beautiful finish. Super-sheer and lightweight, it banishes shine, colour-corrects, conceals flaws and sets make-up to ensure a longer-lasting, flawless look.

Alternatively, the Lancome La Vie Est Belle Eau de Toilette Spray would make the perfect present for mummies who like their fragrances elegant and floral.

From grannies to girlfriends Binky has left nobody off your Christmas gift list 

For Darling Dads

Aramis Adventurer Eau de Toilette is a crisp scent that's smells deliciously bold and masculine. Mixing zesty top notes of lemon and bergamot with the warmth of black pepper and smoky base notes of patchouli and cedar – it's strong, attractive and distinctive: just like all the best dads.

For Gorgeous Girlfriends

Make-up fans are always thrilled to receive quality beauty kit, so the Real Techniques Nic’s Picks Brush Set is a winner. 

This limited-edition brush set is designed by beauty gurus Sam and Nic Chapman, and features five professional-quality brushes designed to create a flawless base and glamorously enhanced eyes.

For Sweet Sisters

The Thierry Mugler Angel Luxury Gift Set is a truly gorgeous girly treat. Presented in a fabulous gift box in the classic powder-blue shade, the set contains an eau de parfum, a body lotion, a body cream and a shower gel, all scented with the iconic Angel fragrance. Irresistible!

Being a beauty junkie Binky thinks that you can't go wrong with cosmetics under the tree 

For Fabulous Fashionistas

The fashion-follower in your life will adore Michael Kors White eau de parfum. This fragrance was created by the celebrated catwalk designer as a tribute to one of fashion’s most revered colours: pure white. 

Housed in a chic brushed-glass bottle, the scent is delicious floral mix of violet, freesia, gardenia, tuberose and peony, with alluring base notes of musk, amber and vanilla. Elegant, sophisticated and sensual – I’m tempted to keep this one for myself!

For Glamorous Grannies

It doesn’t matter how old a woman is, we all love to spoil ourselves, and L’Occitane Cherry Blossom Shimmering Body Lotion is a deliciously pampering treat for the skin. 

The lightweight formulation is enriched with nourishing shea butter to soften and smooth the skin, while a hint of subtle shimmer leaves a flattering iridescent veil on the skin. Scented with a delicate floral fragrance, this is a delicious indulgence for winter skin.

Last-Minute Stocking Fillers

Nuxe Reve de Miel Lip Balm – my all-time favourite lip balm, this leaves lips feeling wonderfully soft and smooth. Always a treat to use and receive!

Roger & Gallet Ginger Soap in Travel Box – beautifully scented and packaged, this soap leaves skin feeling super clean and smelling fresh.

Anna Sui Eye Color Palette – with 10 highly pigmented, buttery soft shadows encased in gorgeous baroque-print packaging, the lucky recipient of this palette will be able to create a plethora of gorgeous eye looks for any occasion.

That’s my Christmas shopping done. I hope I’ve given you a few ideas!

Here’s wishing you all a very Merry Christmas.
