Jenson Button's old tour bus is being offered to hire as an £8,000-a-night 'seven star' hotel.

Holidaymakers who like the idea of exploring the great outdoors but shudder at the thought of a freezing, insect-infested tent may be interested in hiring the palatial motorhome, which was used by the F1 star from 2003 to 2011, taking in his world championship-winning year of 2009.

The glittering tour bus, which was used before Button by another world champion, Jacques Villeneuve, was hand-built by U.S. company Newell and probably boasts similar fuel efficiency to an F1 car thanks to a 500bhp 12 litre engine that allows it to hit 100mph.

Seven star: The motorhome comes with a team of staff, including a gourmet chef and waiters, who cater to guests' whims around the clock

British racing champion Button owned the bus for eight years from 2003 until 2011 - and toured in it around the world during his title-winning season in 2009

Guests who splash the cash will be 
greeted with champagne and a complementary hamper on arrival, while a 
personal team of waiters will be on hand for 24 hours a day.

The epitome of the trend for 'glamping' 
(glam camping) the first million-dollar motorhome also boasts its very own limousine, helicopter and 
Michelin star chef to enjoy in the extravagant bus - which boasts a 42' 
plasma TV, fully fitted American-style kitchen, a walk-in wardrobe and a
 gold ensuite bathroom.

The 500 sq ft palace - dubbed the 'Icon' - sleeps up to four people and is believed to be the largest motorhome in the UK.

Icon Experiences owner Andrew Morris said: 'The Icon is a living piece of history. A unique motorhome, which was the first million dollar motorhome to be created.

'We do have preferential privileged locations both in the UK and throughout Europe but we're more than happy to drive the Icon to the location of your choice.

'With our 24-hour support team always discreetly on hand, we will ensure that all the normal rigmarole of hiring a motorhome is taken care of.'

The bus was built with no expense spared and is coated from floor to ceiling in leather.

Mr Morris added: 'It was made 
especially for life on the race circuits of Europe and has been home to 
Formula One drivers including world champions Jacques Villeneuve and 
Jenson Button.

'With that in mind, guests can expect a top-of-the-range experience and be treated like a world champion.'

Daytona 500-winning Nascar driver Matt Kenseth is a proud owner of a similar vehicle.
