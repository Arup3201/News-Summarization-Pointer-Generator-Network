Lerner offered a defensive opening statement during a May 22 House Oversight Committee hearing, and then refused to answer questions. Republcians argued that she waived her Fifth Amendment rights

Lois Lerner, the IRS official who presided over a partisan program that targeted conservative organizations because of their political beliefs, will retire on Monday with a full pension package, a source at the Department of Treasury told MailOnline.

Lerner, 62, has been a federal government employee since at least 1981, making her eligible for the most robust retirement package the federal government offers career employees.

In May Lerner herself launched the scandal that would eventually claim her job, by answering a planted question about how the IRS handled politically oriented groups that applied for tax-exempt status.

In less than a day, tea party groups were complaining loudly that their applications had been stalled, in some cases for more than three years.

Less than two weeks later, Lerner refused to testify in a congressional hearing about the IRS's conduct, invoking her Fifth Amendment right  against self-incrimination. 

But by making an opening statement defending herself, House Republicans said, she waived that right.

Congressional staff told reporters 
that an internal IRS review board had concluded Lerner was guilty of 
neglecting her duties, and was about to propose that she should be 
fired.

The IRS scandal has had the opposite effect on tea party groups from what Lerner may have intended, galvanizing them against what they see as an intrusive government. Tea Party Patriots held an 'Audit the IRS' rally on June 19 in Washington

Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, told The Washington Times that while an Accountability Review Board was set to recommend Lerner's ouster, it found no evidence of political bias.

Lerner
 is still subject to subpoena and may return to testify in either the 
House Ways and Means or Oversight committee. That investigation could 
have resulted in her termination.

Initially,
 she claimed that the IRS's politically skewed targeting of conservative
 groups was driven by a handful of rogue employees in the Cincinnati, 
Ohio office where she worked.

But documents later surfaced, including some of her own emails, which contradicted that claim and appeared to point to senior managers in Washington, D.C. along with Lerner herself.

The House Ways and Means Committee released some of those emails last week, including one that showed Lerner singled out tax-exempt applications from organizations that described themselves as 'tea party' groups, and ordered that the requests should be held in limbo.

Until Monday, Lerner was on administrative leave, collecting her full salary.

'Just because Lois Lerner is retiring from the IRS does not mean the investigation is over. Far from it,” Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a statement. 

'In fact, there are many serious, unanswered questions that must be addressed so we can get to the truth.'

Hatch is the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the IRS.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reminded reporters in May that President Obama had sought the resignation of the acting IRS commissioner, just days after the tea party scandal erupted. But the West Wing has been silent on Lerner's departure

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman David Camp, a Michigan Republican, released previously secret emails last week showing the Lerner knew early on what the IRS was up to

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican whose House committee has been a consistent thorn in IRS's side since the scandal broke, said Monday that Lerner's departure 'does not alter the Oversight Committee’s interest in understanding why applicants for tax exempt status were targeted and inappropriately treated because of their political beliefs.'

'We still don’t know why Lois Lerner, as a senior IRS official, had such a personal interest in directing scrutiny and why she denied improper conduct to Congress. Her departure does not answer these questions or diminish the Committee’s interest in hearing her testimony.'

The IRS said Monday that it 'has taken decisive actions to correct failures in exempt organizations management, replacing top leadership throughout the chain of command.'

'Our goal is to restore the public's faith and trust in the tax system,' the statement added. 'We have sent nearly 400,000 pages of documents to Congress and facilitated dozens of employee interviews. We look forward to continuing to cooperate with Congress and other investigations.'

The White House, which trumpeted its May
 demand for the resignation of former Acting IRS Commissioner Steven 
Miller, has not commented on Lerner's departure.

House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R) and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (L) have crossed swords over claims that the IRS systematically delayed and unfairly scrutinized tax-exempt status applications from right-wing groups

The Office of Personnel Management provides 1.1 per cent of a retiree's salary for every year worked, provided he or she is a 20-year veteran who is at least 62.

Lerner's base pension would be be calculated based on what she earned, on average, during the past 36 months.

According to the Federal Election Commission, Lerner joined its General Counsel’s Office in 1981, and was appointed in 1986 to head the agency's Enforcement Division. 

'Prior to joining the FEC, she was a staff attorney in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice,' the FEC said in a 2000 news release.

It's not clear when she first came to work at the DOJ, or what her annual salary was.

But if she were in the middle of the senioer-level 'GS-15' earning scale and worked just one year in the DOJ as a staff attorney before joining the FEC, she would collect 1.1 per cent of $140,259 for each of 33 years -- for a total of more than $50,900 per year in taxpayer dollars.

If Lerner's position as a top IRS enforcer were to place her in a special 'law enforcement officer' retirement category, that amount would jump to over $61,700.

In 2010 the U.S. median personal income was just over $29,000.

Lerner will receive 50 percent credit for any unused sick leave she has accrued, according to an attorney at the Office of Personnel Management. 

She could also seek other full-time employment in a law firm or an advocacy group, and still keep her government pension as a secondary source of income.
