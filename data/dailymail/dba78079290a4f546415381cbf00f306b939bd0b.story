A prosecutor who shot himself on camera in his office has said his life was being threatened because he was investigating a plane crash that killed Poland's president in 2010.

Colonel Mikolaj Przybyl had been defending a military investigation into leaks related to the crash that killed then-president Lech Kaczynski and 95 others.

But he asked reporters to leave his office in Poznan, Poland, while he took a five-minute break, and after they left the still-rolling cameras captured the sound of him loading a pistol and a single gunshot.

He defended a military investigation into leaks related to a plane crash that killed Poland's president two years ago

Speaking from hospital, where he is being treated for facial injuries, he told PAP news agency: 'I could accept the fact that my car had been demolished, that my tyre had been loosened in an attempt to kill me, that my dog had been killed.

'I also knew a bounty of (zlotys)1million had been put on my head but I couldn't accept the fact that I had been accused of an illegal action.

'I wanted to commit suicide. I put the pistol barrel in my mouth but my hand shook because I saw the door handle move.

'A man who wanted to shift the cables saved me... the bullet hit my cheek and didn't go through my head.'

Col Przybyl was referring to to reports that the prosecutor's office for which he worked had illegally attempted to obtain the telephone records of journalists suspected of being given leaked information on the Smolensk air disaster investigation.

He then asked the reporters to leave as he 'needs a rest'

It comes after new footage shows the moment panicked journalists realised what Col Przybyl had done after hearing a loud bang from his office.

The recording shows one reporter reentering the room and trying to lift up a stricken Col Przybyl, before seeing the injury caused by the gunshot.

He then signals to other journalists to get help and minutes later the prosecutor is carried to an ambulance and rushed to hospital.

One reporter told Polish TV: 'We heard a loud thud and we went back into the room thinking one of the cameras had fallen over.

'Then we saw the prosecutor lying motionless on the ground in a pool of blood, his military gun beside him.'

Concern: After hearing a loud thud, one of the reporters reenters the room and finds Col Przybyl slumped on the ground

Injuries: The reporter tries to turn the man over, but quickly realised he had shot himself

Panic: He then gestures for other journalists in the room to get help as the man lies bleeding on the floor

Przybyl was taken to hospital, where he is in a stable condition with injuries to his face

The death toll from the plane crash included the country's president and wife, its central bank head and the country's military chief along with other senior government and military figures

Dead: Polish President Lech Kaczynski and wife Maria were among those who perished in the crash

Moments before the shooting, the prosecutor said: 'During my entire service as a civilian and later military prosecutor, I have never brought shame to the Republic of Poland and I will protect the honour of an officer of the Polish armed forces and prosecution.

'Thank you, please give me a five-minute break, I need to rest.'

Col Przybyl is a deputy head of the prosecutor's office and the head of a local department investigating organised crime in the army.

During his brief news conference, he said the military prosecutor's office had the right to seek phone records of journalists covering the investigation of the crash.

He read a statement to reporters in which he objected to plans by Prosecutor General Andrzej Seremet to put military prosecutors under civilian authority.

Mr Seremet said that such a decision has not been made yet.

Col Przybyl also said that military prosecutors were proving themselves competent in the many probes that they have opened into organised crime cases inside the army.

The probes primarily concern suspicions of corruption in buying equipment for Poland's troops on missions in Afghanistan and, earlier, in Iraq.

The media has alleged that the prosecutors had sought billing lists and text message content of mobile phones of some reporters to determine the source of leaks to the media.

Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski said in a statement he was 'concerned' about the suicide attempt and asked the head of the national security bureau to monitor the situation.

Some lawmakers are calling for a special parliamentary probe into the case.

Col Przybyl has a damaged skull and his being treated at Poznan's HCP hospital.

The plane taking then president Lech Kaczynski's delegation to a memorial service for the 1940 Katyn massacre of Polish officers by Soviet secret police crashed in thick fog in Smolensk, western Russia on April 10, 2010.

Russia fully blamed Poland for the deadly plane crash which killed the Polish president.

Russian
 officials investigating the plane crash that killed Lech Kaczynski said the crew was pressured to land in bad weather by an 
air force commander who had been drinking.

Kaczynski and 95 
others, including his wife, died in April 2010 when their plane crashed 
while trying to land in Smolensk, Russia. There were no survivors.

Officials of the Interstate Aviation 
Committee, which investigates crashes in much of the former Soviet 
Union, said that the pilots were pressured to land by Poland's
 air force commander, General Andrzej Blasik, who was in the cockpit.

They said he had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.06 percent, enough to impair reasoning.

Blasik's
 presence in the cockpit 'had a psychological influence on the 
commander's decision to take an unjustified risk by continuing the 
descent with the predominant goal of landing against the odds,' the 
committee chairwoman Tatiana Anodina told a news conference last January.Â 

The report found no fault with Russian air traffic controllers.

Polish officials have already complained that previous 
drafts of Russia's report should have questioned whether controllers 
should have allowed the plane to land in poor visibility.

In December 2010, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused the Russian investigators of negligence and mistakes.

Kaczynski
 and his delegation were on their way to attend a ceremony commemorating
 the victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre, in which 20,000 Polish officers
 and other prisoners of war were killed by the Soviet secret police.

The symbolic importance of Kaczynski's planned visit apparently 
increased the pressure to land the aircraft despite the poor conditions.

But the head of the committee's technical commission, Alexei
 Morozov, said there was no 'concrete command' from Kaczynski to land.

The blood-alcohol content found in Blasik was lower than what is generally considered outright intoxication.

But
 the professional pilots and physicians group says 'the number of 
serious errors committed by pilots dramatically increases at or above 
concentrations of 0.04 percent,' lower than Blasik's level.
