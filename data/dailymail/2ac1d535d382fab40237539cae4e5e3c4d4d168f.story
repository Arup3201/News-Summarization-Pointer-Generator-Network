Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp enjoys the club's full backing, despite his team being in 17th place in the Bundesliga

The German club's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke reiterated on Wednesday they would never sack the 47-year-old.

Dortmund, champions in 2011 and 2012, have been languishing in the bottom spots of the Bundesliga table after having lost 10 of their 17 matches in the first half of the season.

'We will never sack Jurgen Klopp,' Watzke told SportBild magazine. 'He has a lot of merits at the club. It will never come to a confrontational situation with him.'

Watzke's comments echo those made following a crisis meeting with Klopp and sporting director Michael Zorc in December when he said: 'There are zero doubts. We are totally convinced of him. A few weeks ago he was praised into the skies, and the very same people now say that his time is over. I think that's just embarrassing.'

Klopp, who took over in 2008 and also led them to the 2013 Champions League final, has suffered his worst first half to a season at Dortmund, Bundesliga runners-up in 2014.

The coach has already reacted, signing Kevin Kampl from Red Bull Salzburg to boost his midfield in a reported 12-million euro deal. The league resumes on Jan. 30.

'It's great that it worked out,' the Slovenian said on Sky.

'I am delighted. I have been a BVB fanatic as a kid, and it's a dream fulfilled to be able to play for such an outstanding club.'

Despite their bad domestic run Dortmund are still in the running for the Champions League title, taking on Juventus in the round of 16 next month.
