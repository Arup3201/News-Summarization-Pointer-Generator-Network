The typical British tourist runs out of spending money and goes into debt half way through their holiday, new research has revealed.

Five days into a two-week break, some three in ten Brits will have already blown their budget - despite taking on average £600 with them.

And one in ten are forced to withdraw extra money abroad within two days of touching down after using up their spending money.

Blowing budgets: One in ten Brits will be forced to draw out extra money while on holiday after overspending

Brits typically blow their holiday budget by £148 - and one in ten go way over our intended amount by £500 or more, the research by prepaid travel money card Kalixa Pay found.

However, many fail to consider the consequences when we return home as 24 per cent of us take at least three months to pay off holiday debts.

A further one in 14 (seven per cent) will take up to six months and longer to account for holiday overspending.

The reasons why Brits go so over budget include underestimating the cost of food and drink, day trips and buying mementos, a poll of 2,000 adults found.

Yet 43 per cent of holidaymakers admit 'common sense goes out the window' as soon as they set foot abroad.

Four in ten (41 per cent) simply opt to forget about budgeting while on holiday, instead choosing to worry about it when they're home.

With one in four not even bothering to save before going on holiday, it's no surprise half (47 per cent) are horrified by their bank statement on their return.

A spokesman for Kalixa Pay, said: ‘Brits embrace the holiday spirit while away, which is great, so long as splashing the cash doesn't come at a cost to your personal finances when you return home.

‘Sticking to a budget while away can be hard, and the results show how even the best plans fail to come into fruition.

‘Exchange rates can be confusing, and underestimating costs or hidden charges from your bank can easily lead you astray.

‘Proper planning, budgeting and knowing your finances are secure can help to ensure a well-deserved break is enjoyed with that all-important peace of mind.’
