WWII hero Leslie Claydon, 95, proudly wears his Arctic Star medal which he had been denied because the MoD thought he was dead

An Arctic convoy hero has finally got his medal - after bungling Ministry of Defence staff declared he was dead.

Leslie Claydon, 95, has just been presented with the Arctic Star almost a year after many other Second World War veterans.

The ex-Royal Navy serviceman was only eventually awarded the honour because his angry daughter fought to win him it tooth and nail as she told hapless civil servants that he was alive.

Dr Gillian Harris, of Hockley, Essex,
 stepped in to battle for her dad, who now lives in a nursing home, 
after her brother, Ian Claydon, suddenly died.

Dr
 Harris said she filled in the Arctic Star application form for her 
elderly father 'clearly leaving the date of death area blank'.

She furiously fired off a blizzard of emails to MoD staff when she heard nothing back - but still got no response.

Dr Harris said: 'I emailed them time and again. Finally I wrote to them as well.

'Eventually
 they told me they’d dealt with all the people who were due a medal who 
were alive and were now looking at the relatives of dead service personnel.'

She
 redoubled her efforts - insisting that her father was alive and that 
time was of the essence because he was now well turned 90.

'They
 all thought he was dead but he obviously wasn’t - so I told them that 
they needed to prioritise him first,' added Dr Harris.

'I
 used my contact details because my father is partially-sighted so I can
 only think they wrongly presumed that I was applying for my late 
father.'

Mr Claydon proudly showed mayor of Havering Cllr Eric Munday wartime pictures of his warship, which survived the conflict

She said she was mightily relieved that they had got there in the end and her father had finally been awarded the medal he so richly 'deserved'.

Mr Claydon was presented with the Arctic Star by Havering mayor, Cllr Eric Munday, in a moving ceremony at Abbcross Nursing Home in Romford on Tuesday.

The poignant presentation was attended by members of the local Royal British Legion.

Leslie, who served on the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Speedwell, told the mayor: 'Thank you very much, I’m very proud.'

He proudly showed Cllr Munday and Legion officials wartime pictures of his warship, which survived the conflict.

Mr Claydon played a vital role, helping to escort merchant ships loaded with tanks, warplanes, guns, Jeeps and other crucial supplies to Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union after the giant communist state was attacked by Hitler’s Nazi Germany.

The heroic sailor would have faced repeated attacks by German U-boats, surface warships and long-range Luftwaffe bombers in mountainous seas and gale-force winds.

And Leslie and his comrades would have battled bone-chilling temperatures plunging to a deadly -50C as thick ice coated British and Allied ships heading north to the Soviet ports of Murmansk and Archangel deep inside the Arctic Circle.
