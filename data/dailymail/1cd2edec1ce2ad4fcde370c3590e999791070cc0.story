FIFA have warned that the World Cup finals are under threat from match fixers.

Their security experts say they have identified teams and World Cup groups which are vulnerable.

Ralf Mutschke, Fifa’s head of security who is ready to take on the fixers, said: ‘Everyone has a history. Teams have history, players have history, refs have history.

Nothing to play for: Mutschke says matches with teams already out of the tournament are most at risk

‘We know 
warm-up matches were thrown in the last World Cup so that is also useful
 information to help us counter things. We are not expecting fixers to 
be travelling to Brazil and knocking on the hotel door of players or 
referees but I know there will have been approaches to players and 
referees.

‘I
 cannot tell you the teams we are watching most closely. I can’t tell 
you the groups which we are watching most closely. But I will say that 
England’s group is not the highest risk.’

Mutschke,
 a former Interpol executive and police officer, has warned that warm-up
 games and the last round of group matches are the most vulnerable, as 
some of those will involve teams with nothing to play for.

Fixers
 will focus on the number of goals in a match and are most likely to 
entice players or referees to influence two betting markets: the Asian 
handicap and the over-under goals market, where more than 99 per cent of
 bets in Asia are placed.

In
 the first, teams are handicapped according to their form so a stronger 
team must win by more goals for a bet to be successful.

‘I would say I am most worried about these two markets,’ Mutschke told the BBC.

‘We
 had training sessions with referees in Zurich. We are also going to 
meet them prior to kick-off and we also will visit the team and players 
for security sessions. We will give them a reminder to report an 
approach from fixers.

‘We have an officer in the stadium and he will
 act on my decision if necessary. It will depend on the information and 
the response required.

‘He can just monitor the situation regarding 
players, referees, others. He could approach people during half-time or 
directly after the game.

‘He also can use technical equipment to identify possible fixers in the stadium.’
