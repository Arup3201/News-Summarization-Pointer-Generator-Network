Passengers were forced to put on gas masks on the Eurotunnel following a lorry fire in the Channel Tunnel.

Eurostar, which operates train services through the tunnel between Paris, London and Brussels, cancelled all services yesterday because of the blaze.

And the company is now facing a multi-million pound compensation bill as thousands of holidaymakers were left stranded in London and Paris.

Hundreds of Eurostar passengers filled St Pancras station after all trains were cancelled following a lorry fire

All Eurostar trains were cancelled for rest of Saturday following the blaze at the French end of the tunnel

Eurostar services are yet to resume as attempts to clear smoke from the tunnel continue.

All passenger services and the Eurotunnel Le Shuttle car service were halted after the vehicle caught fire at the French end of the underground railway's south tunnel yesterday. 

A Eurotunnel spokesman said on Twitter: 'Taking slightly longer than anticipated to recommence services, we need to be sure any residue smoke cleared completely before we do so.

'They aren't running yet, but should be within the next couple of hours. I appreciate it's frustrating, sorry.'

Earlier, the company said it will run a full service tomorrow 'for passengers who have an existing reservation for this date'.  

It said trains would be delayed by between 30 and 60 minutes because of only one tunnel being open.

But it strongly advised people whose trains were cancelled today - and who faced three hours queues to get a refund - not to arrive at stations unless they had already been re-booked. 

Frustrated passengers reported three-hour queues to refund their tickets at St Pancras station

A spokesman said: 'All passengers who are booked to travel tomorrow, Sunday January 18, should check in as normal half an hour before departure.

'Eurostar services tomorrow are already very busy and availability is limited.

'If you were on a cancelled train today and need to travel urgently tomorrow, please call our contact centre after 8am tomorrow and we will try to re-book you on a service departing after 12pm.

'We would strongly advise passengers whose journeys were impacted today by the problems in Eurotunnel not to come to our stations unless they have re-booked through our contact centre.' 

Services on the Le Shuttle car and freight service, operated by Eurotunnel between Folkstone and Calais, were also cancelled but 'anticipated' to resume later.  

Huge queues built up at St Pancras station in London yesterday as hundreds waited up to three hours for ticket refunds. 

Customers were being offered £50 compensation for meals for every 24 hours they were delayed and £150 per night for a hotel in London by Eurostar. 

Two carbon dioxide alarms are said to have gone off inside the tunnel with Eurotunnel investigating the cause

Cancelled: All trains were returned to their original stations as Eurostar services came to a halt

Two carbon dioxide alarms are also said to have gone off just before midday, with Eurotunnel investigating the cause.

All trains were returning to their original stations with the tunnel closed until further notice, with 26 trains cancelled during the disruption.

British passengers complained about the delays as they had to turn back because of the disruption.

David and Christine Hocking from Bridport in Dorset boarded the 10.58am train from St Pancras to Paris.

Three hours later they were once again waiting at St Pancras after being diverted back to London.

Mrs Hocking said: 'We got to the tunnel and then said said we will be delayed. Then they said the tunnel was closed.'

'Everyone was just annoyed, there was no threat,' she added.

The couple had a two-week boat trip planned around Scandinavia and have already made all of their travel bookings.

Mrs Hocking said: 'We have got to get to Copenhagen for tomorrow.

'We are going on a boat for two weeks and this is now going to have a domino effect.'

She added: 'There are not enough people helping. Nobody is saying anything and they aren't telling people their rights. They are supposed to give us information.

'It is out of their hands but they don't seem to know what's going on.'

Eurostar urged passengers to leave the station but many remained in hope of a refund or a later train

Ben Lawton was taken to a 'make shift medical centre' amid fears they could inhale the fumes. 

He told the Sun on Sunday: 'We were evacuated and given gas masks. Then we were taken to an airtight concrete room within the tunnel and had to wait for two hours.

'Then we were taken by coach to Calais.'  

Artur Ogonowski, a council worker from Preston had planning to travel to Paris to take his four-year-old son Alex to Disneyland.

After standing in the queue for more than an hour, the family were still only a third of the way to the front.

Mr Ogonowski, 35, said: 'We checked in at 12.50pm and we have Disneyland booked for tonight. We left home in Preston at 8am.'

He added: 'They don't seem to know what is going on - they just asked us to queue.

'We don't want refunds we just want to get there.'

Matthew Harvey from Sydney was travelling with his wife and three children to Paris. It would have been the first time his children had visited the city.

Mr Harvey, 44, said: 'We got on the train and it kept stopping and we didn't know why.'

Passengers were then told they would be returning to London.

Mr Harvey said: 'We thought that it might be a bit of an overreaction because of everything that has been happening.'

He added: 'We were due to be staying in Paris for a week. We are hoping to get there tomorrow. We need to get to Paris because our flight back to Australia is from there.'

'Eurostar have given us £150 per room for tonight which isn't easy in London,' he said.

Josiane Marcel, a 35-year-old banker from Paris arrived at the station at 4pm to return home after a weekend in London.

She said: 'I didn't get anything from Eurostar - not a text or an email.

'We didn't know anything about the disruption before we got here.

'When I arrived the man said the tunnel was closed and gave me a leaflet.'

Impasse: No Eurostar passengers will be heading to France for the rest of the day following the closure

Elsewhere, on Twitter, Labour peer Stewart Wood wrote: 'Enjoyed my Eurostar trip from Paris to Calais, 3 hours without moving & then back to Paris. Gare du Nord unchanged since I left 6 hours ago.'

Graduate Margaret Murphy tweeted: 'The wait to exchange/refund #Eurostar tickets. Just told it could be over 3 hour wait here at St Pancras.'

Kristen Davis, who works in Paris, tweeted: 'Once again I'm stuck in a @Eurostar in Northern #France! instead of heading to #London we're going to Lille.'

Ben Pedroche tweeted: 'Meltdown at St Pancras due to all Eurostars cancelled. Lots of pissed-off French people.'

A carbon dioxide alarm is also said to have gone off just before midday, with Eurotunnel investigating the cause

A spokesman for Eurotunnel insisted that there was no fire in the tunnel, but there was smoke coming from a lorry.

Cargo on the lorry was said to be smoldering but it is not clear what the goods on board were. The fire has now been doused.

He said: 'Technicians have gone in and have seen smoke and not flames.

'Two CO2 detectors went off in the north tunnel. As is procedure, the trains came to a controlled stop. All traffic was slowed down and was reversed back to stations.'

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A lorry fire has led to the closure of both bores of the Channel Tunnel.

'The fire was at the French end of the tunnel and is being dealt with by the French authorities. There are no reported injuries.

'However, rail passengers are advised to expect significant delays whilst the vehicle is being recovered and fumes are cleared from the tunnels.'

The closure comes amid heightened security following the terror attacks in France last week.

In March, hundreds of Eurostar passengers were delayed after a lightning strike triggered a fire in a building close to the entrance to the tunnel in Kent.
