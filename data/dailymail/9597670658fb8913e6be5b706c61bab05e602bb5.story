A 16-year-old girl killed a 12-year-old boy after reversing into him while taking her first driving lesson with her father.

Police said the unlicensed girl had been learning basic driving skills  in the driveway of their home in Lewisville, Texas. 

Her father had reportedly given her permission to start the engine before she lost control of the vehicle.

Tragedy: Eric Lozano, 12, was killed when he was hit by a car being driven by a 16-year-old girl who was having her first driving lesson

The car accelerated  out of the driveway and careered across the road before hitting Eric Lozano and crushing him against a house.

A number of other children are understood to have witnessed the incident which happened on Friday evening last week. A 10-year-old who was also hit by the car escaped with only minor injuries.

One of the victim's friends Luis Alvarez told CBS DFW: 'I didn’t believe it would end like this.

'It’s hard for us, his friends, especially the ones who saw everything.'

Teddy bears, candles and letters have been left at a memorial at the spot where Eric was killed.

His uncle Brandon Brown described him as a happy child who loved to play with his friends.

Mr Brown said Eric 'Loved to play sports, ride skateboard, go fishing, loved his mom, his brother. You know, just a normal 12-year-old boy.'

Yesterday police said they were still gathering evidence and were not yet prepared to comment on the incident.

The boy's mother is currently in hospital suffering from exhaustion and fatigue.

His aunt Erica Mendez believes legal action should be taken against the 16-year-old driver.

She said: 'There’s been nothing, and something has to be done, legally.

'The child should have not been behind the wheel getting taught how to drive in a neighborhood where there’s kids everywhere running around and playing'.

A Go Fund Me page set up by the family to help with funeral costs has so far raised over $12,000.
