Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) has announced another purge on so called 'death taxes'

Widows will be able to inherit their partner’s Isa without paying a penny in income tax, the Chancellor has announced.

In a further purge on so-called ‘death taxes’, widows or widowers will be able to save nearly £500 a year on a £60,000 nest-egg that has been inherited.

George Osborne also confirmed that spouses of deceased partners who receive payments from an inherited annuity won’t have to pay any tax from next April.

Every year, anyone aged over 16 can save tax-free in a cash Independent Savings Account. The annual allowance is currently £15,000, and set to rise to £15,240 next April.

But some 150,000 married savers die each year with an Isa which is passed to a spouse or civil partner, government figures show. When this happens they stop being an Isa – so interest earned on them is taxed.

Someone who has built up more than £60,000 in a cash Isa earning 2 per cent would normally earn £1,200 interest tax-free. But outside an Isa, a basic-rate taxpayer would have to pay £240 tax a year on this interest; and a higher-rate taxpayer £480.

‘This restriction was a source of deep frustration and extra cost for grieving spouses,’ said Danny Cox, chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown wealth manager.

‘It’s good news for couples as most manage their money jointly, and the loss of the tax-free status on the cash has often come as a shock to the surviving spouse.’

The Chancellor said this brought Isa savings in line with reforms on pensions. Changes to the rules on Isas will give another boost to their surging popularity.

In July, in a bid to boost savings in a climate of low-interest rates, the limit for tax-free savings was ‘supercharged’ by the Chancellor – and lifted from £11,880 to £15,000. However, the amount allowed to be saved in cash had previously been limited to £5,940. The new flexibility introduced from July 1 allowed savers to put the whole £15,000 allowance in cash.

Savers can now also switch money between cash and shares; before the summer, you could only switch from cash into shares.

Since being launched in 1999, Isas have helped encourage millions to put money aside for emergency savings – as well as boost their income in retirement.

Roy Hamilton will be able to pass on the full worth of his pension to his wife if he dies before the age of 75.

The 65-year-old former council worker, from Bristol, has taken out a joint life annuity on his £75,000 pension pot with the help of advisers Hargreaves Lansdown.

His 59-year-old wife Julie, a seamstress, is still in work but will be able to take 100 per cent of his pension without it being taxed after his death.

The latest changes level out the playing field after the Budget in March allowed pensioners to take lump sums from their pension pots tax-free, but left those with an annuity worse off.

Mr Hamilton, a grandfather of two, said: ‘The reason I took out an annuity is I like the idea of a regular payment. I took out a joint annuity to look after my wife, and she’ll get 100 per cent of that after I’m gone.’

Some 23 million investors and savers have £443billion in Isas. This is roughly equally split between cash and shares. The retirement shakeup means if a loved one dies before the age of 75, the surviving spouse won’t pay any tax on an inherited joint annuity. The Treasury is also to change tax rules to allow a joint annuity to be passed on to any beneficiary.

The Chancellor’s announcement on joint annuities marks the latest in a long line of radical pension reforms started in his March Budget.

From next April, there will be no need to buy an annuity. Those aged 55 or over will be able to dip into their pension whenever they want.

Each time they withdraw cash, 25 per cent will be tax-free. However, they will have to pay income tax at their usual rate on the rest. The reforms also mean they will be able to leave pension cash in their will without the 55 per cent death tax, by paying into a so-called drawdown scheme.

The Chancellor embarked on the reforms to stop savers being locked in to annuities that can be poor value or unsuitable for their lifestyle.

An extra £2billion will be poured into the health service every year to relieve the pressure on hospitals.

Mr Osborne said he had found the money from budget surpluses in other departments.

Health chiefs had warned ministers that they faced an immediate funding gap due an ageing population, expensive new drugs and a rising bill for staff pensions.

In addition to the £2billion for frontline services, Mr Osborne announced another £1.1billion for struggling GP practices over the next five years

It will be to funded by bank fines.

Simon Stevens, the new head of the NHS in England, welcomed the cash injection.

He has warned that the NHS faces a funding black hole of at least £8billion by the year 2020.

The future of the NHS is expected to be a key battleground for May’s general election.

David Cameron has already promised to protect its budget from cuts if he wins.

Decaying churches could be restored to their former glory with the help of a new £15million fund for repairs.

George Osborne announced that the Cathedral Renovation Fund will now be extended to cover repairs to all of Britain’s churches.

It is hoped that the new money will help rescue the hundreds of church buildings which have fallen prey to thieves – who have been targeting the valuable lead in their roofs.

Church leaders of all denominations will be able to apply for grants of between £10,000 and £100,000 in order to fund any repairs which are deemed to be urgent.

Last month more than 800 churches were listed on English Heritage’s ‘at risk’ list because they had fallen into severe disrepair.

The Bishop of Worcester, the Rt Revd Dr John Inge, said that the grant would make a ‘real and lasting difference’ to parishes. He added: ‘A secure roof can last 100 years and will prevent gradual, and ultimately costly, decay of fabric.’

Exposing the hidden mortgage fees

The Government is to probe baffling mortgage fees which make it hard for homebuyers to get the cheapest deal.

Trade body the Council of Mortgage Lenders has been asked to work with consumer campaign group Which? to put an end to hidden house buying fees, it was revealed in yesterday’s Autumn Statement.

Research by Which? has found that buyers can face more than 40 different layers of hidden fees when they buy a home. These include added extras such as fees for bank transfers, references and insurance. Charges run on through the life of a mortgage and can even be added at the end of a loan term.

Because of fee confusion, just 3 per cent of buyers tested by Which? were able to correctly rank five deals in order of best value.

The CML has now been told to make charges more transparent so that consumers can compare the total cost of mortgage deals. Paul Smee, director general at the CML, said: ‘Consumers need to be able to understand and compare products confidently. We welcome the opportunity to work with Which? towards measures that can make this easier for them.’

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘With so many people on tight budgets trying to get a foot on the housing ladder or looking to remortgage as rates rise, it’s essential that they can more easily find the best deal.’

Any measures will be introduced in time for April’s Budget.

From April, households paying a care worker up to £22,500 a year will not have to pay NI contributions. Stock picture used

Families who employ a carer will benefit from a National Insurance cut worth up to £2,000 a year.

From April, households paying a care worker up to £22,500 a year will not have to pay NI contributions. The Chancellor has extended the Employment Allowance – a perk already available to charities and some small businesses – to ‘help with the employment of carers who do so much’.

Emily Holzhausen, director of policy at the charity Carers UK, welcomed the move, saying it would help those relying on carers to buy more help or cope with pressure on their finances. She said: ‘This measure goes some way to reducing the cost of paying for care for families but more needs to be done to bring down the overall costs of care. There are 1.4million people providing more than 50 hours’ unpaid care for loved ones every week.

‘For those who do not qualify for social care services, the costs of care are high… many continue without much-needed care services until they reach breaking point.’
