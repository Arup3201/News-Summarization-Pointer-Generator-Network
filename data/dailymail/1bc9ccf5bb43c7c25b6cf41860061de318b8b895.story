Country rock star Billy Ray Cyrus has been duped into retweeting a picture of paedophile Jimmy Savile by a prankster who claimed it was his grandad.

Twitter user 'Jake imo' sent the singer, best known for his number one single 'Achy Breaky Heart', a picture of Savile and wrote: 'Hi pal, it's my Grandad's birthday today and he's a huge fan. He'd love a RT!' 

The American singer, 53, who is father to global pop sensation and wild child, Miley Cyrus, sent the message on to his 1.75million followers.

Billy Ray Cyrus was tricked in to retweeting a picture of paedophile Jimmy Savile to his millions of followers

But fans were quick to alert him of the mistake to tell him the image was one of Britain's most predatory sex offenders.

Savile abused at least 500 victims, with the youngest allegedly just two years old, the NSPCC has reported. The most common age group for his victims was 13 to 15.

He also targeted hospital patients, ranging from five-year-old children to 75-year-old pensioners, including men, women, boys and girls. He may have even committed sex acts on dead bodies in the mortuary at Leeds General Infirmary.  

Donald Trump, 68, was tricked into sharing this photo of serial killers Fred and Rose West after he was sent a message by a follower saying the tycoon had been a 'big inspiration' to his parents 

The team who run the Apprentice US star's Twitter feed shared the message, but quickly removed it after realising the mistake. The serial killers (right) murdered young women and girls between the 1960s and 1980s

Five hours after he shared the post, the tycoon said it was evidence you should not be 'nice and trusting'

The concept of 'Rickrolling' is basically sending a person a link to something that appears interesting or relevant. 

But it is actually just a disguise - when the person clicks on the link, it takes them to Rick Astley's uber-cheesey music video for his 1987 song 'Never Gonna Give You Up.'

The clip managed to find its way into pop culture, with celebrities and even politicians 'Rickrolling' people. 

Donald Trump was on the receiving end of a similar joke earlier this week, when he retweeted a picture of infamous serial murderers Fred and Rose West. 

The US business magnate was contacted on social media by Philip Bradbury, who sent him a message saying his late parents had always considered him a 'big inspiration'- but included an image of the convicted rapists and murderers instead.

The message was quickly shared on the multi-millionaire's feed by his media team to his 2.7m followers but was taken down 40 minutes later after they realised their embarrassing mistake.

But hours later the tycoon responded, saying he may sue the culprit.
