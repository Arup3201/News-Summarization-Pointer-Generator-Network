The mayor of Washington D.C. is demanding that the city’s major football team, the Washington Redskins, change its name as it is offensive to Native Americans.

Mayor Vincent Gray said if the team wants to move from its current playing field outside the capital inside the borders of the District of Columbia they need to consider a new moniker.

The word ‘redskin’ is considered a racial slur against Native Americans and the name has seen the football team face decades of legal battles.

Calling for change: Mayor Vincent Gray said if the team wishes to move within the borders of Washington DC they need to 'do the right thing' and remove Redskins from their name

‘I think that if they get serious with 
the team coming back to Washington, there's no doubt there's going to 
have to be a discussion about that,'' he told a news conference on Wednesday.

‘I think it has become a lightning rod, and I would love to be able to sit down with the team and see if a change should be made.'

Mr Gray added: There's a precedent for this, and I think there needs to be a dispassionate discussion about this, and do the right thing.’

Mr Gray referred to the case of the city’s Washington Bullets basketball team which changed it's name to Washington Wizards in 1995 due to the high homicide and crime rate in the city at the time.

This is not the first time the Redskins have faced a battle over its name.

A legal case against the club’s name was filed in 1992 by a group of Native Americans headed by Dr Susan Shown Harjo, founder of the National Museum of the American Indian.

Although lower courts held up that the word ‘redskin’ was an offensive term towards Native Americans the case was thrown out by the Supreme court in 2009.

‘The term ‘redskins’ is the most vile and offensive term used to describe Native Americans,’ Dr Harjo told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011.

‘It is most disturbing to the overwhelming majority of Native Americans throughout the country that the professional football team in the nation’s capital uses a team name that demeans us.’

The Washington Redskins currently play at the FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, a contract which runs out in 2026.

The Washington Redskins is an National Football League team based in Washington D.C.

The Redskins have won five NFL Championships, three Super Bowls and two pre-merger.

Washington Redskins was founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves in Boston, Massachusetts. The team’s name changed the following year when it moved to share the home field with the Boston Red Sox and became Boston Redskins, and has been the Washington Redskins since its move to D.C. in 1937.

The team played at the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in DC until 1997 when the move to the current FedEx Fields in Landover, Maryland.

The team is ranked as the second most valuable in the NFL by Forbes Magazine, and was the highest grossing team during the 2009 season with $345 million in revenue.
