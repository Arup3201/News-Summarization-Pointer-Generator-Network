Acclaimed Irish author Colum McCann was badly injured after being attacked while trying to break up a domestic dispute just outside the gates of a famed Ivy league school

McCann was reportedly trying to break up a fight early Saturday evening between the woman and her boyfriend at a New Haven, Connecticut hotel. Yale University calls the city home.

He instead ended up with a concussion, broken cheekbone and some broken teeth from the 'shocking, cowardly attack in broad daylight on a busy street,' he told the Irish Times in a statement.

The assault reportedly happened when the novelist stepped in while a man and woman were fighting outside The Study at the Yale Hotel around 10.00 p.m., according to the New Haven Independent.

First responders arrived to find him on the sidewalk bleeding from the head, police told the paper.

He was taken to the hospital, released later that night and returned home to New York City.

‘I was trying to help someone out,’ his statement said. ‘I was cold-clocked without warning. I had a severe concussion, a broken cheekbone, some broken teeth and a spirit that has been temporarily bruised.

‘But I am recovering quickly and I’ve been overwhelmed by the generous response from friends and strangers alike.’

He credited an nearby off-duty paramedic with rushing to his aid as the attacker fled the scene.

McCann told the Times he was in New Haven to attend a conference on empathy at Yale University for Narrative 4, a non-profit organization he is involved in. He was forced to pull out of a Sunday event because of the attack.

‘I suffered a few injuries but nothing that can’t be quickly healed,’ he continued.

‘If anything, I was shaken out of the ruts of my ordinary perception, and I have been struck the genuine caring nature of people asking about how they can help out.’

The award-winning author then used the opportunity to call attention to ‘others who suffer far worse violence.

‘We need to speak out against this sort of thing. The police have not yet arrested the attacker but I believe they are very close to pressing charges, using video and witness evidence,’ he added.

‘It could have happened anywhere in the world. The fact that it happened on the edge of one of the world’s foremost colleges campuses simply highlights how prevalent this sort of situation is,’ said McCann.

New Haven, where Yale University is located, does have an above-average crime rate, but it is not as common for attacks like this to occur on or near the campus.

Police told the Independent that an investigation remains ongoing, and that they are working under the assumption this was not a random attack.

‘What we believe happened is that the victim tried to intercede in what appeared to be a domestic dispute between a man and a woman,’  said Assistant Police Chief Archie Generoso. ‘He saw a woman pushed to the ground. He tried to assist the woman.

‘He asked the woman if she wanted him to call the police. He urged her to do so. She said she didn’t want to call the police. The guy said, ‘It’s your decision.’ He turned around, began to walk away, and he was assaulted,’ Generoso continued.

McCann is home recovering and should be back to normal within a few weeks.

He has written six novels, including 2011’s Let the Great World Spin – which earned him international acclaim and several awards including the International Impact Award and many other honors.
