A lamp bought for just 50p at a church fete turned out to be an ingenious device that helped the Allies bring about the downfall of the Nazi regime in the Second World War.

The beacon lamp was used to flash Morse code signals from the beaches of Normandy during the D-Day landings in 1944, directing troops to landing points on the five designated beaches as they raced over the sea in landing craft.

Martin Billenness, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, had no idea of the lamp’s history when he was given it as a present from his mother, who had bought it for next to nothing in the 1990s.

To his amazement, specialists at London’s Science Museum and Imperial War Museum identified it as a beacon lamp specially commissioned by the War Office.

The 11in lamp displays the Morse signal for any chosen letter of the alphabet, helping to direct soldiers to their correct landing zones.

To understand the inner workings of the lamp better without damaging it, two x-rays were taken.

They revealed a small 2.5v electric motor driven by a 2.4v battery.

A dial on the top of the lamp allows it to be set to the desired Morse code letter, and when switched on it flashes its signal every seven seconds.

The lamp would have been taken onto the beach by an advance party and turned on, identifying the correct beach and correct landing point for the landing craft.

The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies’ assault on German-occupied western Europe.

The mission, which took place on June 6, 1944, was the largest amphibious invasion in history and mainly involved British, American and Canadian soldiers.

The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah.

The savage and bloody landings turned the tide against the enemy forces, opening up a second front (the Russians were advancing on Germany from the east) and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe.

Mr Billenness, 52, took the beacon lamp along to the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow in his hometown of Eastbourne to show experts and reveal the remarkable story.

The lamp is now on display to the public at the Redoubt Fortress and Military Museum in Eastbourne.

Mr Billenness, a self employed glazier, said: 'I was given this lamp as a present from my mother who had picked it up at a church fete.

'At the time I was into beach fishing so she had bought me a Tilley lamp but at the same time spotted this lamp and thought it looked interesting.

'I had no idea what it was or where it had come from.

'The only giveaway was the Ministry of Defence stamp on the top of it so I knew it had something to do with the military.

'It also had a very strange dial on the top with each letter of the alphabet on it.

'I was really intrigued so I took the lamp to the Redoubt Fortress and Military Museum in Eastbourne and asked them.

'They were equally bewildered and said they had never seen anything like it before.

'They then sent it to the Science Museum and the Imperial War Museum to study.

'The experts there told me it was a beacon lamp that would have been used for beach landings such as the D-Day raids.

'It is incredible to think this lamp could have been used in the D-Day landings.

'As I understand it, very few of these exist now, probably because they would have been left behind or thrown away once the job had been done.

'It’s a very special and unusual item.'
