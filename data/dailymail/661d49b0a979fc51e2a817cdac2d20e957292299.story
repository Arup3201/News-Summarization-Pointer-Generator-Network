Victim: LeRyan Nicholson, pictured, was once a promising student and athlete but in his late teens his behavior drastically changed

A Nashville mother has traced her teenage son who disappeared in 1998 to an unmarked pauper's grave and learned he was brutally murdered the day after she reported him missing but police didn't connect the two cases.

Sylvia Nolan's heartbreaking search for 18-year-old LeRyan Nicholson ended in March when DNA tests linked the teen to remains buried in a plot in a public Nashville cemetery just three miles from her home.

'They told me they already buried my baby, my son, without me,' said Nolan, who previously had no idea her son had even been killed.

The plot's gravestone read simply 'John (19) Doe,' signifying that he was the 19th unidentified man buried in the Bordeaux cemetery. Around him lie 1,001 others who died penniless and often unmourned.

Nicholson was once a promising student and athlete but in his late teens his behavior drastically changed.

He quit school, began to show signs of having a mental illness and later moved out of his mother’s house, Nolan told The Tennessean.

His step-sister, Candace Williams, added: 'It was like he was confused as he was talking. It didn't make a lot of sense. Jumping from one thing to another, not completing a thought.'

At the age of 18, he began smoking and his hair started to turn gray.

'That's when the nightmare started,' Nolan told the paper. 'He was just not the same anymore.'

On
April 12, 1998, Nicholson just left. His mother filed a missing 
person's report, but she was told he probably left of his own accord.

The following day, April 13, an unidentified man was discovered rolled up in a carpet, dumped against a fence and set on fire.

He was burned beyond recognition and it never occurred to police that it could be the missing Nicholson, despite the body turning up just one day after Nicholson vanished.

He was unceremoniously buried in a paupers' grave.

Sgt. Gary Kemper, who now heads Metro's Cold Case Unit, told The Tennessean detectives worked feverishly on the case and located persons of interest but the lead dried up in 2001.

'They just didn't follow up correctly. A mistake was made,' Kemper said. 'When you look at it now, it's hard to understand why.'

Nicholson's family on the other hand never gave up searching for their loved one. They checked hospitals and homeless shelters but found no trace.

Nearly 15 years later, in 2012, Williams found a government website called NAMUS, which was a nationwide database for missing persons, unidentified remains and unclaimed bodies.

She searched for her brother and the John Doe that had been rolled up in a carpet appeared.

The family called the police straight away and they obtained a DNA sample of Nicholson and matched it to one that was taken from John Doe in 1998.

In May this year, Nolan said the unnamed headstone that marked her son's grave was removed and a new one was put in its place. 

After it had been replaced, Nolan told the newspaper she patted the new headstone and whispered 'Momma's here.'
