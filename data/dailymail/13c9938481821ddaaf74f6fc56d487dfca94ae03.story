An Oregon woman leading police on a high speed chase ended it by jumping off a bridge.

Rebecca Humphries, 26, of Troutdale, ran numerous red lights and stop signs and drove erratically Wednesday while leading police on a frenetic chase in a stolen car before she jumped off a bridge – she sustained serious injuries but will survive the plunge.

A MailOnline review of court records showed she had reason to run, her criminal record contains dozens of counts including drug possession and theft charges.

Dashcam video released by the Troutdale Police Department shows Ms Humphries taking multiple squad cars on a joyride through the suburban Portland town.

The career criminal even crashes into some bushes before slamming on the gas and high-tailing it away before police can catch her.

The ensuing chase reached speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, police said.

‘I was trying to return the car to the guy that was in retaliation for me ditching it,’ Ms Humphries told KATU from her hospital bed. ‘I started to get pulled over and got scared and 'fight or flight' kicked in and I jumped.’

The chase: The bridge can be seen just ahead, police had no idea what was about to happen

The approach: Ms Humphries jumped out of the moving car and ran to the bridge's railing

The climb: She didn't even look back towards the cop car before scaling the guard rail

The chase then takes an unexpected turn when she comes to a bridge and slows down enough to jump out of the vehicle while it is still moving.

Ms Humphries climbs over the bridge’s railing and jumps into the ice cold Sandy River more than 30 feet below, according to the Oregon Herald, without even the slightest hesitation.

‘I looked down, but I didn't hesitate,’ Ms Humphries recalled. ‘I just jumped… It didn't look as far when I looked down, as it did when I looked up.’

Rescue workers eventually pulled her from the water and took her to a local hospital where she is receiving treatment for broken vertebrae, KATU reported. She is expected to make a full recovery.

Just before the dismount: She was on the railing for only a split second before disappearing over the side and into the water below

On a better day: The Stark Street Bridge is only 35 feet above the water

‘Really, jumping from that bridge, in itself the distance to the water is dangerous - for somebody to jump that distance,’ a police spokesperson told KATU. ‘And into freezing water also, I have no idea what was going through her head.’

Ms Humphries was cited for numerous traffic violations, police said. No further information was provided, and MailOnline was unable to reach a police spokesperson.

She may have ran because she has a lengthy criminal record spanning at least 26 charges including multiple theft and criminal trespass convictions, as well as four felony heroin possession convictions – two filed only four days apart in 2012.

The troubled woman also has also been convicted of a litany of traffic offenses.
