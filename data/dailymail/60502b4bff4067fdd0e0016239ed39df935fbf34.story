History man Steven Fletcher has spoken of his pride as he ended a six-year international scoring drought to become the first Scotland player to net a hat-trick since 1969.

The Sunderland striker hit his treble in the 6-1 triumph over Gibraltar, with two Shaun Maloney penalties and a Steven Naismith strike also helping Hampden recover from the shock of Lee Casciaro’s first-half equaliser for the Group D minnows.

Not since Colin Stein bagged four against Cyprus in 1969 had someone scored more than two for the national side.

Regardless of the weak opposition in the Euro 2016 qualifier - albeit the Scots fell victim to the visitors’ first-ever competitive goal to make it 1-1 - Fletcher admitted he was thrilled to have achieved a feat that eluded even the great Kenny Dalglish.

‘I got asked after the Northern Ireland game if I could get a hat-trick and I laughed it off,’ said Fletcher.

‘I said I would be happy with one goal as I haven’t scored for a while. So to get the hat-trick was really pleasing. I was delighted.

‘I’ve been told that it was 46 years since the last Scotland hat-trick and I was shocked.

‘I thought Kenny would have managed it so I am very happy and proud to be part of history.

‘It means a lot. It’s really good and it will be one of the best achievements of my career.

‘I’ve got the match ball and I’ll probably put it in a little glass cabinet. I have another one from my Hibs days when I scored a hat-trick against Gretna, so I will put it next to that. That was my last hat-trick so it will go beside that one.’

Fletcher had last scored for Scotland against Iceland in 2009, and had drawn a blank since his return from a 19-month international exile in 2011.

The 28-year-old gave thanks to Gordon Strachan for sticking by him and hopes this boost will help him over the remainder of the Euro 2016 campaign, which continues with a crunch trip to Dublin in June.

‘It’s been a while since I scored for Scotland and I was aware of that. I get told every day,’ he said.

‘It’s good to get off the mark again, especially after being out for a long time. Was it getting to me? Not really. I was still confident going in to games.

‘To be honest I haven’t had many chances in games but I had a lot against Gibraltar. I could have scored more than three but I was just happy to get the goals.

‘Getting the hat-trick will definitely help my confidence going into the summer. Hopefully I have done enough to stay in the gaffer’s plans and I’m looking forward to it.

‘The manager likes my link-up play. I know people have been saying I haven’t scored but I’ve been doing other parts.

‘He’s praised me for that and if I can keep doing that, and add goals, then I’ll be happy.

‘He’s been a massive support to me. He’s been great with me since I came back into the Scotland squad and I owe a lot to him.’
