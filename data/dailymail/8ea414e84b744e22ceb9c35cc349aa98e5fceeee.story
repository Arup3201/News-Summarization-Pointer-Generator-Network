A tax raising the price of sugar sweetened drinks could help tackle the obesity epidemic, scientists have claimed.

Scientists at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, measured the effect of a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks, on the prevalence of obesity in adults in the country.

The team found the effective price rise could act as one initiative, in a multi-faceted approach to preventing obesity, Medical Daily reported.

Researchers found that implementing the tax resulted in a 3.8 per cent reduction in obesity in men and a 2.4 per cent fall in women, equating to a fall of 220,000 obese adults in South Africa.

Author Mercy Manyema, said the onus is on governments to help improve the health of the population.

'It is the responsibility of the 
government to protect the health of its population,' she said.

'One way of doing so 
is through "nudging" people to make healthier and more sustainable 
choices.

'An SSB (sugar sweetened beverage) tax has the potential to do this in addressing 
obesity-related diseases.'

Senior researcher, Professor Karen Hofman, added: 'While SSBs alone may not be the 
only reason for an increase in body fat, these fizzy drinks do not 
contain any essential nutrients, have a high sugar content and a strong 
link to weight gain.

'Drinking just one SSB a day increases the 
likelihood of being overweight by 27 per cent for adults and 55 per cent for children.'

The report follows a recommendation by the South African Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, on the need to regulate foods high in sugar, in order to tackle the overweight population, and the diseases related to obesity.

Author Aviva Tugendhaft, added: 'This is not surprising considering that one 330ml serving of a 
fizzy sweetened drink contains an average of eight teaspoons of sugar 
and the same size fruit juice contains an average of nine teaspoons of 
sugar.'

In the last 30 years, the number of obese adults in South Africa has soared, making the nation the fattest in sub-Saharan Africa.

More than half of adults are now considered to be overweight or obese - 42 per cent of women and 13 per cent of men.

The paper was published in the PLOS ONE journal.
