As the celebration of all things beer continues in Munich for Oktoberfest, millions of people attending make the extra effort to fit in with the history of the event.

Thought to have began in 1810 the annual festival brings hundreds of millions to the local economy, with an estimated £252m flowing at the venues themselves, while hotels and hostels get a boost of more than £230m for their hugely inflated room rates. 

And the jovial nature of the festival is often reflected in the attire of revellers. 

Prost! Participants dressing up in historical German dress adds authenticity to the event

History: The digitally enhanced photos take us back to a world of yesteryear

Standing out: Some festival-goers leave no stone unturned in their bid to look the part

Sellers of traditional lederhosen and dirndls did a roaring trade in the lead-up with a majority of festival goers looking the part.

And these digitally enhanced photographs reflect the mood perfectly, as well as bringing a real authentic feel to the scenes.

Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter opened the 181st Oktoberfest last weekend by tapping the first keg of beer.

A million people attended the legendary festival over the first two days, consuming a million one-litre beers and tens of thousands of bratwurst and roast chickens, according to organisers.

Last year, the event attracted 6.4 million visitors who downed 6.7 million litres of beer.

Oktoberfest was first celebrated in 1810 when Crown Prince Ludwig married Princess Therese and invited Munich's citizens to join the party on the Theresienwiesen ('Therese's meadow'), the fields in front of the then city gates. 

Oktoberfest runs until October 5.
