Robert Curtis, 47, threw himself in front of a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in north west London after taking cocaine and painkillers

A property tycoon jumped to his death in front of a tube train after losing his fortune, an inquest heard today.

Robert Curtis, 47, threw himself in front of a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in north west London after taking cocaine and painkillers, the hearing was told.

Father-of-one Mr Curtis - who it is said once dated supermodel Caprice - made millions of pounds in the early 2000s after launching a luxury property lettings business.

At its peak Mr Curtis ran the firm from his office in upmarket St John's Wood, near Lord's cricket ground in north west London, and owned a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate.

He was once registered as a director of 15 firms and jetted around the world to do business, and was even said by one friend to have dated model Caprice Bourret.

However, by the time of his death last November his business empire had crumbled and he was reduced to living in a Travelodge motel, the hearing was told.

The tycoon fell on hard times as the recession saw all but one of his companies fold, with friends claiming he was suffering from depression at the time of his death.

He was also reported to have been devastated by the suicide of his friend Paul Castle, a polo-playing pal of Prince Charles who threw himself under a tube train at Bond Street station in central London two years earlier.

Mr Curtis had been reduced to living in a budget Travelodge hotel in Whetstone, north west London, at the time of his death, today's hearing was told.

A jury at North London Coroner's Court heard the former millionaire was carrying just over £25 cash when he killed himself and that traces of cocaine were found in his urine.

Tube train driver Adam Giles told the inquest of the moment Mr Curtis stepped in front of his train.

He said: 'I remember pulling into the southbound platform, seeing a gentleman walking down the platform.

He was said to be devastated at the loss of his wealth and of the death of his friend Paul Castle, a polo-playing pal of Prince Charles

'He stopped, looked into the cab of the train and stepped off the edge of the platform.

'There
was no-one around. I pulled the emergency brake on the train which 
stopped about two-and-a-half carriages into the platform. I opened my 
cabin door - I was really shocked.

'I
was approached by a passenger on the platform who said 'I think someone
has just gone under your train - that confirmed what I had seen.'

He was once registered as a director of 15 firms and jetted around the world to do business, and was even said by one friend to have dated model Caprice Bourret

A post mortem carried out by Dr Simon Poole after Mr Curtis' death revealed he had died of multiple injuries.

Summarising the findings of Dr Poole's report, Coroner Andrew Walker said: 'It gives a cause of death as multiple injuries consistent with a high energy collision with a moving train.'

And toxicology report revealed Mr Curtis had taken painkiller codeine prior to his death, although his alcohol levels were normal.

Traces of cocaine were also found in his urine, but not bloodstream, meaning that he would not have been experiencing its stimulant effects when he died, the court heard.

Summarising toxicologist Rebecca Andrew's findings to jurors, Mr Walker said: 'In effect it was negative, there was nothing in there that played a part in Mr Curtis' death.

'The report showed cocaine had been taken more than two to three hours before death, but no cocaine was present in the blood. The deceased would not have been experiencing the stimulant effects of the drug.'

However, Mr Walker said Mr Curtis may potentially have been feeling depressive after-effects associated with cocaine use, including drowsiness.

Jurors at the inquest heard how a suicide note was discovered on Mr Curtis' body, saying simply 'I love you mum and dad'  with his father's phone number written on the back.

A colour photograph of Mr Curtis and his young daughter was also discovered by police, bearing the words 'I love you baby xxx' on the back.

Asked about the note, Mr Curtis' father, Monty, told jurors: 'It was something he had torn off another piece of paper. 'It was maybe three inches long by one inch wide and he had just written on it "Love you mum and dad."'And when quizzed about the photograph by a juror, Mr Curtis answered: 'It was him and his daughter.'

Returning a verdict, the jury foreman told the court: 'The conclusion as to the cause of the death of Mr Curtis was that he killed himself.'
