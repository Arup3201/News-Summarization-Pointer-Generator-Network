People with noble-sounding surnames such as King and Prince are more likely than the average person to work as managers, a new study suggests.

However, those with names of everyday occupations like Cook and Farmer have a lower than average chance and are more likely to remain lower down the career ladder.

Individuals with prestigious names who have achieved high-ranking jobs include Lord King, former governor of the Bank of England and Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice.

A survey of 223,000 German workers by Cambridge Business School has found that people with 'royal sounding' names were more likely to hold managerial positions

The findings come from a study by the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School, which looked at nearly 223,000 German workers.

People with surnames such as Kaiser (emperor), Kvnig (king) and F|rst (prince) were more likely to hold managerial positions than those called Koch (cook), Bauer (farmer), and Becker/Bdcker (baker).

'This phenomenon occurs despite the fact that noble-sounding surnames never indicated that the person actually held a noble title,' the authors wrote.

It appears that the status associated with a name can 'spill over to its bearer, influencing the status accorded to that person and consequential life outcomes, such as his or her career advancement.'

The status linked to surnames could shape interpretations of workplace performance or drive people with noble names to 'actively pursue high-status jobs', the authors said.

Conversely those with more 'working class' names such as baker and cook were less likely to be in charge

Reporting their findings in the journal Psychological Science, the authors said that in terms of career outcomes 'characteristics about a person that logic dictates should not make a difference often do.'

They compared their research to past studies, which have found taller people tend to get higher-status and better paid jobs.

A 'metaphorical association between height and high social status leads us to believe someone taller would make a better CEO and in a similar way someone with a noble name 'may be seen as more worthy of occupying a managerial position'.

The study involved using the website Xing, the German equivalent of LinkedIn, to collect information on people with the 100 most common German surnames, plus all people with 'noble sounding' last names.

This led to analysis of 222,924 employees and managers with 84 different last names, showing that noble names really do appear to have career benefits.
