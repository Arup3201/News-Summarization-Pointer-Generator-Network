At least 41 members of Boko Haram  have been killed in clashes with the army in Cameroon this weekend, the government said today. 

The Cameroonian army launched a series of air strikes and on-the-ground attacks on the  militant Islamist group after it crossed the border and seized a military base. 

President Paul Biya personally ordered the retaliation attack which forced Boko Haram  to flee the military base at Assighasia, a government representative said in a statement late Sunday.

'Fighter planes went into action for the first time since the start of the conflict on the Cameroonian side of the frontier, after several months of deadly cross-border Boko Haram raids', Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. 

'After two strikes and heavy fire... the assailants fled the Assighasia camp... losing several fighters,' he said. 

Military operations were still under way, he added, saying that 'the toll from combat will be released once the operational evaluation is complete'. 

The extremists of Boko Haram, have made frequent raids into neighbouring Cameroon since they began their insurgency in northern Nigeria in 2009.

Boko Haram tactics include massacres of civilians on both sides of the frontier, bomb attacks on state institutions and schools, and the razing of villages and mass kidnappings.

Since early in 2014, the movement has sent growing numbers of fighters into Cameroon, prepared to battle the army head-on as well as attacking and intimidating villagers.

On October 15, Boko Haram forces equipped with a captured tank and an armoured vehicle attacked a military base at Amchide, near the border, in a raid that killed several dozen civilians and eight soldiers, according to officials. 

The air strikes marked 'a new escalation in the Cameroonian response... to multiple enemy attacks by the Boko Haram terrorist group,' the statement said, but it also sent a signal to other countries.

Cameroon's neighbours, together with former colonial power France, have long criticised the authorities for what they considered a passive response to the actions of the jihadist movement even as its members used Cameroonian territory to rest and buy food and weapons.

When a French family was kidnapped in 2013, along with two Italian priests and a Canadian nun, President Biya sent major army reinforcements to confront the Islamists in 'Operation Alpha'. The hostages were freed this year in Nigeria.

Some 2,000 Cameroonian troops patrol the far-north region, but security sources say that many more are needed because the area is so remote with a very porous border.

Military sources accuse Nigeria's army of failing to do enough against jihadist forces who have taken control of large swathes of the northeast of the country.
