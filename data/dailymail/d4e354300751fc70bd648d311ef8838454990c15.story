Coldplay have replaced the rock tradition of illuminating the stadium with lighters and mobile phones during big anthems by handing out radio-controlled glow bands.

The band gave out 10,000 of the multi-coloured wrist bands to the audience when they played in the final X Factor show at Wembley last night.

They performed two songs from their new Mylo Xyloto album, while the innovative new bands lit up and flashed in time to the music.

‘It’s like asking everyone to hold their mobile phones up without having to ask,’ said lead singer Chris Martin.

They also handed out 20,000 wristbands, called Xylobands, to everyone at the O2 arena at the weekend, where they played as part of their December tour.

The LED light bands worked during four songs at the O2 gig when people would normally have waved lighters.

‘It looked absolutely amazing to see everyone wearing them and the whole stadium lit up,’ said Claire Adams, 36, from London.

‘I was given the wristband when I entered the arena and I had no idea what it was until it started flashing during the first song, it’s a fantastic idea.

‘Until now people have always waved their mobiles, but this is so much better.’ They have been developed by RB Concepts, based in Honiton, Devon, and Coldplay has now bought part of the company.

Entrepreneur Clive Banks and Jason Regler approached the band to see if they would be interested in using the wristbands and were stunned when they agreed.

According to Chris Martin, Mr Regler used to manufacture sex toys.

He told Xfm: 'There's a guy called Jason who likes Coldplay. He used to make mobile phone vibrating sex toys. I think he came to Glastonbury this summer and he had an idea while we were playing to make these glowband things.

'He contacted us and said... "what do you think?".. and we said "it sounds like the best idea ever"... and now we have them for every person who has a ticket.'

Mr Banks said: ‘It was a huge challenge to design, manufacture and deliver the wristbands at very short notice, but we are now working with the hottest act on the planet.

‘The big thing is audience participation and this means bands can relate more to the audience.  

‘It means there is a lot more audience participation, as opposed to it being static.’ He said the wristbands could even be used at the Olympics.

‘The next move would be to have the wristbands at sporting events and night time events,’ added Mr Banks. ‘We are also looking towards using them at the Olympics.’
