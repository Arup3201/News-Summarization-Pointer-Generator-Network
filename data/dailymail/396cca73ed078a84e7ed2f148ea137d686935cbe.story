Searching for the word ‘drunk’ on YouTube produces more than 10.7 million results.

To study how these videos portray drinking and the dangers surrounding it, researchers analysed 70 of the most relevant and popular alcohol-related videos on the site.

They discovered that in the world of YouTube, alcohol is funny, drinkers are attractive males and there are few consequences to getting drunk.

Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh studied the 70 most popular alcohol-related videos on YouTube. Search terms included ‘drunk’, ‘buzzed,’ ‘hammered,’ ‘tipsy,’ and ‘trashed.’ The study found that videos tended to involve males more than females and almost half referred to a specific brand

‘Several studies have linked watching movies containing alcohol abuse in them with actual alcohol-related behaviors,’ explained Dr Brian Primack, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh.

‘These initial studies were cross-sectional, so it was hard to determine if exposures influenced the behaviours or if people who drank alcohol were drawn to alcohol-related media exposures.

Researchers studied the 70 most relevant and popular videos on YouTube related to alcohol intoxication.

Search terms included ‘drunk’, ‘buzzed,’ ‘hammered,’ ‘tipsy,’ and ‘trashed.’

They subsequently created 42 codes in six categories.

These were video characteristics, character socio-demographics, alcohol depiction, degree of alcohol use, characteristics associated with alcohol, and consequences of alcohol.

The 70 videos were each around four-minutes long and combined views exceeded a third of a billion.

The videos tended to involve males more than females, and almost half (44 per cent) referred to a specific brand name of alcohol. In fact, 55 different brands featured across the 70 videos.

While active intoxication was frequently shown (86 per cent), only 7 per cent of the clips referred to alcohol dependence or withdrawal.

'However, more recent longitudinal studies have suggested that media exposures can be influential.’

Yet YouTube hasn't been studied in this context and with a high degree of rigour, continued Dr Primack. 

‘YouTube is an important medium to study for a couple of reasons,’ he continued. ‘If you want to learn about something in general, you will often 'Google' it.

‘However, more individuals are now going straight to YouTube for their searches, because it provides written information, visual information, and group discussion, all together.’

Active intoxication was frequently shown (86 per cent), only 7 per cent referred to alcohol dependence or withdrawal. There were more 'likes' when humour was present (example pictured) and more 'positive sentiment' when a brand name was mentioned and when the people in the video were attractive

While active intoxication was frequently shown (86 per cent), only 7 per cent of clips referred to alcohol dependence or withdrawal.

There were more 'likes' when humour was present versus when it was not, and more 'positive sentiment' when a brand name was mentioned, when liquor was mentioned, and when there was 'attractiveness' present.

This was based on ratings of how attractive the people in each video were.  

And, there was less positive sentiment when negative emotional or physical consequences from alcohol use were shown. For example, videos featuring people injuring themselves received fewer likes.

Elsewhere, hard liquor such as spirits and wine were more common than beer.

‘We are not sure why hard liquor was commonly represented, especially because beer is more frequently consumed in the US, and the vast majority of videos came from the US,’ said Dr Primack.

‘It may be because liquor has a high alcohol content, and so users may find it more edgy and interesting to post and/or view material related to this.’

Results are published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research.
