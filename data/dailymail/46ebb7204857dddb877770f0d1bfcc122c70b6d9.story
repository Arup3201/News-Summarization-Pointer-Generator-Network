A three-year-old boy fell into his grandparents' swimming pool and drowned after he was left unsupervised for 10 minutes, an inquest has heard.

When Alfie Hayward disappeared while playing outside, his mother Lauren Pither thought he was just hiding in order to jump out and surprise her.

But she found him face down in the 6ft-deep pool, and although he was rushed to hospital doctors were unable to save his life.

After a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, police had to separate Alfie's father Kenny Hayward from Ms Pither's relatives as the bereaved family's emotions boiled over.

The inquest in Chelmsford, Essex heard that the boy lived with his mother in Colchester.

Ms Pither said that on August 18, 2012 she went with Alfie to her parents' house in Ardleigh on the way to Great Yarmouth for a camping holiday.

She went into the house with her sister, while her parents left to pick up a camper van and Alfie played in the front yard.

'I told him to stay in the front, I did not want him going around the back,' she told the inquest.

However, when she came back out the boy had disappeared. 'We started looking for Alfie, he was missing 10 minutes at most,' Ms Pither said. 'He had gone around the back.'

She thought he might be hiding behind a bush in order to jump out at her, which he had done previously, but then found him face down in the swimming pool.

There was also a chair, a rock and a rubber ring in the pool, leading Ms Pither to believe that her son had climbed on the chair to throw the rock in before falling into the water.

'It is what I know my son would do,' she told the hearing, adding that she could not have seen the pool from her parents' house.

Alfie was taken to Colchester General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, and a post-mortem examination found that he had died from immersion.

Insp Lynne Corder, from Essex Police, told the inquest there were no suspicious circumstances.

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: 'It was a tragic accident - I am sure you are all going over and over it in your minds and saying "What if?"

'He was probably a lovely little boy with a bright future ahead of him, and I would like to express the court's condolences to all of you.'
