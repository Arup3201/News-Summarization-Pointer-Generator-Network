Mario Bassi knew the old Methodist chapel near Cinderford in Gloucestershire was the home for him as soon as he walked through the door: he is 6ft 6in tall and it was a huge relief to have room above his head for once.

The spacious interior, large windows bringing in masses of light  and the potential to create a unique home big enough for a family sold the Victorian chapel to both Mario and his wife Caroline when they first saw it in 2004.

It had already been converted into a house, but the Bassis had their own ideas.

Seeing the light: Caroline and baby Mariella sit in the suspended bubble chair above the glass floor - beneath them are Mario, Angelina and Valentino in the hallway

While it remains virtually the same from the outside as when it was built in 1869, Mario, 45, and Caroline, 38, have transformed the chapel’s interior into a fantastic contemporary family home, with shiny red kitchen, glass floor and brightly coloured windows.

It’s an upside-down house, with the bedrooms – seven of them – on the ground and lower-ground floors, while the first floor, once a smaller mezzanine, is now a stunning open-plan living space with high ceilings, original timber floors and windows on all four sides flooding the area with light all day.

As you come through the wide glass and wood front door into the hall, a strikingly impressive staircase leads you up to the first floor. The staircase was made locally, to Mario’s own design, from oak and steel with clear glass balustrades.

Although he has no training as a designer, Mario, who used to be a management consultant and now runs a group of Subway sandwich shop franchises, is fascinated by design and is not short on ideas.

He did the drawings using PowerPoint, adjusting the dimensions so that even the oak handrail was the right fit for his larger-than-normal grip.

Half-a-million home: The old Methodist chapel near Cinderford in Gloucestershire, built in 1869, boasts seven bedrooms and is on the market for £495,000

Open plan: The stairs, designed by Mario, which leads up to the lounge and kitchen

At the top of the stairs, the 38ft by 28ft living space certainly has the wow factor. There are more than  ten windows, including a deep porthole in the kitchen area and three dramatic arched windows at the staircase end.

Two of these have been covered with different, brightly coloured film, creating rainbow patterns when the sun is at a certain angle. It was Mario who painstakingly applied the coloured film.

In front of the coloured windows, the old mezzanine floor was extended to fill the space above the hall with thick glass – a clever way of maximising the floor space upstairs without having to lose the sense of height and space as you come into the chapel.

Above the glass floor is a bubble swing chair suspended from the ceiling – the perfect place to curl up and read a book, says Caroline.

‘We didn’t know what to do with that space at first,’ she says. ‘Then I thought of the bubble chair. Now it’s my favourite spot in the house.’

What helps give the chapel interior its contemporary edge is the stylish and original lighting. Above the stairwell hangs a spectacular bespoke light fitting made up of a series of different sized spheres in vibrant colours, reflecting the colours in the arched windows.

‘It looks great at night,’ says Mario. ‘People stop us in the street and say how much they love looking up at our balloon lights.’

Modern eating: The kitchen in the seven-bedroom home, transformed from late 19th century chapel to family residence

Comfortable leather sofas, bright rugs and a contemporary log burner set into the wall create a stylish sitting area, while bronze-coloured glass blocks separate the kitchen without dividing up the room.

The hob is inset into the large granite island so that the cook can socialise with whoever else is in the room, with the bright red bar stools a magnet for guests, says Mario.

Where the altar used to be on the ground floor is now the couple’s bedroom. There are four more  bedrooms on this floor, two of which are used by children Angelina, six, and Valentino, five – with a third ready for baby Mariella who’s just  a few months old. The fourth is used as a playroom.

Mario and Caroline have an  en suite and there’s also a luxurious marble family bathroom with walk-in power shower, a super-sized bath and a sink set in granite.

The lower ground floor is where Mario has his office. Caroline, an ex-teacher, helps him run the business. There are two more bedrooms for guests, another bathroom, Mario’s gym and a garage.

While there is no shortage of bedrooms, some of them are quite small and the Bassis are now thinking forward to when their children are older, and have put the chapel on the market at £495,000.

‘Their bedrooms are fine for them now but they’ll need bigger ones when they’re teenagers,’ says Mario. ‘We will miss the chapel terribly, though – we’ve put so much of ourselves into it.’
