Shamed council officials have been forced to drop a £50,000 benefit fraud case against a disabled woman - because evidence against her was made up.

Mandy Barratt, 47, said she lived in 'constant dread and fear' during a five-year inquiry into allegations that she was claiming benefits illegally.

But her battle with Basildon Borough Council, in Essex, is almost over after the authority halted the prosecution.

Council officers admitted a key whistleblower in the case had been invented by staff.

Now Mrs Barratt is considering legal action against the council, which carried out the investigation together with the Department for Work and Pensions.

Mrs Barratt said: 'These were the worst years of my life - living with constant dread and fear.

'I felt vulnerable, scared and bullied.

'I have never done anything dishonest and the humiliation and embarrassment were hard to live with.'

Mrs Barratt, who suffers from spinal cord damage, had been accused of wrongly claiming £54,807 of income support plus housing and council tax benefits as a single mother between July 2001 and January 2007.

She split from her husband Steve Barratt, 51, back in 2000 but continued to live in a mobile home on his land in Wickford, Essex.

Although the pair never divorced, they insisted that Mrs Barratt was entitled to benefits as a single parent because they were separated, even if their living arrangements were unconventional.

Council officials thought otherwise and referred the case to the Department for Work and Pensions, saying they were relying on details from an anonymous phone call in April 2007.

But a report by the Information Commissioner has now revealed the council were forced to change their records to show the call was never received.

An investigation began after planning officials read a local newspaper article on the pair.

Mr Barratt criticised council officials over their handling of the case.

He said: 'They used fictitious evidence which has now been proven.

'Mandy has been through a nightmare and suffered so many stress-related illnesses.'

Mrs Barratt is seeking legal advice about claiming compensation after investigators froze Mrs Barratt’s benefits between June 2008 and September 2010 leaving her with drastically reduced funds.

Her benefits were later re-instated and a refund was given at a social security tribunal in September 2010.

Nigel Smith, leader of the council's Labour group, raised 'serious concerns' about the investigation in February 2010.

He said: 'The investigation into this matter and the papers brought before the tribunal are full of minor errors and omissions.

'There was never an anonymous referral and this needs to be made absolutely clear with an unqualified statement.

'It is important the council observes proper process in dealing with these matters so everyone - including the courts - can have confidence in the integrity of the council.'

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman confirmed the case was withdrawn, but refused to comment further.

Lorraine Browne, solicitor for the council, said: 'This is a complex and detailed case and the council intends to respond in full to both the Information Commissioner and the complainant as soon as possible.

'It would be inappropriate to make any further comment.'
