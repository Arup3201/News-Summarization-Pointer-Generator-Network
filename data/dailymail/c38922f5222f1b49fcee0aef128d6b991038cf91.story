Former Northern Ireland international and Real Mallorca striker Gerry Armstrong is an expert analyst and commentator for Sky Sports’ coverage of Spanish football. Here, he shares his thoughts with Sportsmail's Craig Hope on the Gareth Bale saga at Real Madrid…

Gareth is under a lot of pressure and sometimes that can get to you. But the recent criticism aimed at him is completely unfounded and unnecessary.

I have seen him play really well this season and I have seen him play some indifferent games.

He is probably having a decent season, but it could still be brilliant. Real are only four points behind Barcelona in the league and you would fancy them to get past Atletico and into the last four of the Champions League.

Gareth Bale was heavily criticised after Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Liga rivals Barcelona 

An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca

Bale has been criticised by Real  supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013

And don’t forget what an impact he had last year. He scored in the final of the Champions League and Copa del Rey and finished with 22 goals. He's on 16 now and will better that total this year, what more can you ask? All this talk of dropping him is rubbish – you can’t drop Gareth Bale, he scores and creates too many goals.

Real have been going through a slump in the past five weeks or so. They have been missing key players.

But it seems Gareth has been taking a lot of the stick from fans, and I don’t agree with that, although he has probably been trying too hard at times.

Now that Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are back I think you’ll see Gareth really re-emerge and rediscover his best form, because I admit he wasn’t great against Barcelona on Sunday.

He wasn’t the only top player to disappoint, but he disappeared from the game for long periods and sometimes he needs to be more forceful.

Cracks seem to be appearing in Bale's relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo

On the issue of him being unhappy, only he knows how happy he really is at Madrid.

Part of the problem is the language and being comfortable with your team-mates.

Then there is the situation with Cristiano Ronaldo. I wouldn’t say the relationship between himself and Ronaldo is bad, but Cristiano was so petulant when Gareth scored his goals against Levante last week - he could not hide the disappointment from his face. He’s like a spoilt brat at times.

But the fans are so forgiving with Ronaldo because of the goals he scores, it’s very unfair.

They say Gareth should pass more to Ronaldo - that’s nonsense. It was the same with Cesc Fabregas and the pressure on him to pass to Lionel Messi at Barcelona. It’s not helpful.

AS say Real 'missed and they paid for it' while Marca highlight Madrid's misses during the La Liga match

I would like to see Gareth say, “I’m better than all of this” and prove how good he is on the pitch - and I think he will because he has got great ability. He’s got everything - he scores goals and creates them, he’s brilliant in the air, he strong, he’s fast, he’s aggressive. For me, he’s very close to being right up there with Messi and Ronaldo.

There is talk of him going to Manchester United, but it would be a huge mistake on Real’s part if they agreed to sell him.

If I was him though I’d keep my options open and see how I feel at the end of the season.

But I think he will still be at Madrid next season. This will blow over given a few goals and the team clicking again.

In a few weeks’ time I’d bet we’ll be having completely different discussions about Gareth and all of this will be forgotten.
