Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who left her Glasgow home for Syria after becoming radicalised, has written a guide on how to be a war widow, sparking rumours her Islamic State fighter husband has been killed

A British jihadi bride who fled to Syria to marry an Islamic State fighter has written a guide on how to be a war widow, sparking rumours her extremist husband has been killed.

Privately-educated Aqsa Mahmood, who left her privileged life in Glasgow to join ISIS militants in Syria, has taken to social media to hit out at jihadists for 'failing to tell their wives what will happen to them after they die'.

The 20-year-old, who was taught at Glasgow's £3,500-a-term Craigholme girls' school, has also demanded fighter wives to read-up on how long they need to wait before remarrying under strict religious laws.

In one recent post, she said: 'You already knew you wanted to marry a Mujahid [a person who is engaged in jihad] so why did you not read up on what will be the rulings for you after his departure?

'Sisters, it is very important you read up on all the information you can find on your Iddah [period of waiting], it's rules and regulations.'

It is not clear from her online posts whether the militant husband she flew to the war-torn country to marry has been killed.

The former medical student, who now calls herself Umm Layth, also warned women that they need to learn the proper dress etiquette for widows.

She added: 'Be prepared for what you can and cannot wear.

'Most importantly know your rights as a Muslimah [single muslim woman].'

'Don't let anyone tell you you can't do such and such when you are allowed. Don't live in ignorance, ukhti [my sister].'

It is not the first time the former Scottish schoolgirl has taken to social media.

Last year, she wrote on Twitter how would-be jihadis could follow in her footsteps.

In another outburst, she urged extremists to carry out 'another Woolwich', referring to the barbaric murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

She has also previously advised wannabe Islamic State wives to bring clothes, books and cosmetics to Syria.

Mahmood (pictured) travelled to Syria to join ISIS extremists and marry a fighter after dropping out of a diagnostic radiotherapy degree course in Glasgow. She reportedly became radicalised by 'online material'

In 2013, she travelled to Aleppo after dropping out of a diagnostic radiotherapy degree course. It is believed she went on to marry an Islamic State fighter.

Her parents Muzaffar, 51, and wife Khalida, 44, have previously begged their daughter to come home and said she had 'betrayed' her family.

In a statement released after their daughter fled, they said: 'We still love you but we now have to put your family, your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step.

'All parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we feel nothing but sorrow and shame. You have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever, please come home.'

Abu Muthanna al-Yemeni, believed to be Nasser Muthana, who fled to Syria from Cardiff, Wales

Jihadists from Cardiff who fled to Syria were 'talent spotted' by a secret Islamic State agent in Wales, a leading security expert has claimed.

Professor Anthony Glees, a former Home Office adviser who has published six books on national security, said 'recruiting sergeants' for the terrorist group were roaming Welsh cities in search of new recruits.

He said Cardiff brothers Nasser and Aseel Muthana, as well as their friend Reyaad Khan, were all likely to have been groomed by Islamic State after meeting undercover agents in Wales. 

The trio all travelled to Syria last year to join extremist fighters.

Sleeper agents for the group would 'talent spot' intelligent or charismatic young people who expressed a 'resentment' towards British foreign policy, the Buckingham University professor warned. 

He said: 'I would be very sure that this was the case [with the Muthana brothers and Khan] and I think many Muslim community leaders would say the same thing.

'I believe Islamic State has people on the ground who are acting as recruiting sergeants who look out for people like this and then approach them to begin the radicalisation process.

'People are not just radicalised online. They are approached by what we might call Islamic State's recruiting sergeants - people who deliberately go around schools, campuses and Islamic community centres looking for people like this.

'Their friends may see them as idealistic and interested in politics and that's the kind of person Islamic State is looking to recruit. It has been like that for a very long time.

'They will play on the resentments they may have about Palestine, or about the Iraq war, and they will look out for people who are up for it because they are disillusioned.

'They know that if you get them while they are young then you have them for ever.'

Professor Glees said the Muthana brothers and Khan could have been groomed by a secret Islamic State agent who passed them instructions on how to join jihadists in Syria.

'You cannot just get on a plane and walk to the Islamic State. You have got to find a way to cross the border from Turkey and you need to have made personal contact with people who will know how to do that,' he said.

He called for teachers to be vigilant about 'disillusioned' pupils who could be seduced by Islamic State's 'sophisticated' propaganda machine.

'We must make sure these people don't sit and brood. That's what teachers are there for, to discuss these issues in a democratic fashion,' he said. 

Professor Glees also warned that once young Britons joined the terror group they were on a 'path of no return' and could never rejoin British society because they were so severely brainwashed.

'When they join the Islamic State they are lost for ever. Once they become extremists they are always extremists.

'I don't believe there are significant number of people going out to fight with the Islamic State who get there and say, 'Oh, this is terrible, and we were so wrong about believing in this.'

Former medical student and Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State with friend Khan - also from the Welsh capital - sat alongside him (together above) in June last year

'There is nothing we can do about them once they have gone out there. They can certainly never be allowed to come back because once they are radicalised there is no way of bringing them back to British democratic values.

'It is also undeniably the case that these people coming back from the Islamic State represent a real and present national security threat to the United Kingdom.

'There are some who say that on the one hand it is extremely wrong to go and fight for Islamic State but on the other almost 100 years ago people went to fight the Spanish Civil War and that was seen as a noble thing.

'But my view would be that they fought for democratic values against totalitarianism.

'With Islamic State it is the other way round - they are fighting for totalitarianism against democratic values.'

Last June, former medical student Nasser Muthana, from Cardiff, appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State with friend Khan - also from the Welsh capital - sat alongside him.

The pair, both 20 when they fled for Syria, were later joined by Nasser's teenage brother, Aseel.

The brothers - who both attended a Cardiff primary school - left behind their stunned family in the city.

Their father, 57-year-old Ahmed, said: 'I feel very sad. It's devastating. Not only shocking - devastating.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We are working in communities across the country to challenge terrorist ideology, including disrupting extremist speakers and removing material online, and intervene when people are at risk of being radicalised and exploited.

'But we are clear that we will take the strongest possible action against those who have travelled to Syria or Iraq and return with the intention of doing harm - both through our existing powers and by introducing new ones through the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill - to make sure we can defend ourselves against the serious and rapidly changing threats emerging from the region.'
