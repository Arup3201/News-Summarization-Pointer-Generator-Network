The father of girl who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew has apologised after claiming she met the Queen while on a trip to London with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Virginia Roberts' father Sky, 58, had boasted this weekend that his daughter, who said she had sex with the royal while under-age, was introduced to Her Majesty on a trip organised by Epstein.

Buckingham Palace emphatically denied that any such meeting took place. 

But today Mr Roberts retracted his claim. In a statement sent to MailOnline, he said: 'I want to clear up that many years ago Virginia stated to me she was to meet the Queen's son Prince Andrew and not the Queen herself. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding.'

He added that he had not demanded that Prince Andrew be prosecuted, but said that 'any person whether it is a Prince or a pauper, if anybody has sex with a minor, they should be prosecuted.'

Mr Roberts said this weekend that his daughter told him 'a few years back' that she had met Prince Andrew and the Queen after she had been flown to London by Epstein.

The claim of a meeting with the Queen was not made by Miss Roberts herself. 

Responding to Mr Roberts' claim, a Palace spokesman said: ‘There is nothing to suggest that this claim is true. We have no record of such a meeting.’

Prince Andrew vehemently denies the claims made in a new legal action by Miss Roberts that he abused her as an under-age girl at an orgy where she was being used as a ‘sex slave’. 

The legal allegation states that Miss Roberts was ‘forced’ to have sex with the royal at parties in London, New York and the Caribbean. 

She claims she was told to ‘give the prince whatever he demanded’ by his friend Epstein – the US paedophile who hosted the parties – and that she was converted ‘into what is commonly referred to as a sex slave’. 

Sky Roberts spoke out this weekend to support his daughter, who is now 30, and said her claims should be tested in court.

Her father said: ‘I brought up my children and that includes Virginia to always tell the truth … Why would she lie?’

Mr Roberts, who lives on a five-acre ranch in Summerfield, near Ocala, Florida, said he had never talked to his daughter about her allegedly being kept as a sex slave by Epstein and loaned out to other rich men.

But he insisted that if Prince Andrew did have sex with his daughter when she was 17 and under the legal age limit, he should be prosecuted.

‘I don’t care if he is a prince or the guy who lives down the road … it should not have happened and they must face the consequences,’ he said. ‘Having under-age sex is against the law and he should be prosecuted.’

Mr Roberts, who divorced from Virginia’s mother Lynn eight years ago, said he has not spoken to his daughter in three months. Miss Roberts and husband Robert left their home in Titusville, Florida, and are now in Colorado. 

Her father said he never suspected she was being abused by Epstein and his friends; adding: ‘At the time we thought it was all OK. Virginia never once said anything about any sexual activity. I never asked her because I did not think that was going on.

‘Mr Epstein seemed an upstanding kind of guy. She would go to his house in Palm Beach but always come home. When he started flying her all over the world we just thought what a life she was having … All Virginia ever said was that she was hired to give massages.’

He said his daughter was never in trouble with police and avoided any involvement in drugs while growing up in California and Loxahatchee, Florida.

‘There was one occasion when she was taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning … She was about 15 years old. That was the only time she had been in trouble. Growing up she had everything she wanted. It was a good family life with her brothers Sky [now 25] and Daniel [now 35].’

Mr Roberts, who is retired, admitted he has not read any of the allegations made by his daughter and avoided reading her account in 2011, when she waived her right to anonymity and talked about her time with Epstein.

FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’

SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’

SATURDAY EVENING, in response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’

 He said: ‘I still don’t want to know. Virginia has never talked about it with me, as it’s not the sort of thing a father wants to hear from his daughter. I might be putting my head in the sand, but that is the way I want it … What Virginia did back then is in the past.’

Mr Roberts said he visited her several times when she lived in Australia. She moved back to the US 18 months ago to be closer to her family.

In court documents, Miss Roberts – who is not named – says she was ‘procured for sexual activities’ for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell.

Miss Maxwell is alleged to have facilitated the prince’s ‘abuse’ of the girl. The legal documents, lodged with a Florida court, name Miss Maxwell as a ‘madame’ and a ‘primary co-conspirator in [Epstein’s] sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. She has previously branded all claims against her as ‘untrue’ and ‘obvious lies’. The court papers name Andrew, 54, as one of three men allegedly involved in abusing ‘Jane Doe #3’ when she was 17 – under-age according to Florida state law.

Epstein, a long-term friend of Andrew, was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for under-age prostitution. The pair remained friends and were seen together in 2011 after Epstein’s release.

On Friday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’.

Andrew’s accuser countered the statement, saying via her lawyers that she is an ‘innocent victim’ and: ‘I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.’
