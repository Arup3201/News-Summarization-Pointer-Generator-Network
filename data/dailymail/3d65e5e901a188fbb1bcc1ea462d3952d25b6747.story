A former school worker arrested yesterday in Michigan for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student has appeared in court.

Abigail Marie Simon, 33, entered a not-guilty plea today to charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.

Simon was fired from her position as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic high schools in April after the boy's mother found pictures of Simon in a garter belt on her son's phone.

Police also found text messages of a sexual nature between Simon and the boy and an arrest warrant was obtained this week.

Simon allegedly had a sexual relationship with the student between February 1 and April 26 of this year at her former apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West, in Grand Rapids.

According the MLive.com, Grand Rapids Police Detective Amy Lowrie said that the alleged victim initially told police that he and Simon had sexual contact but then recanted his testimony.

'Recently [he] has admitted that there was sexual contact again. And the text messages that were found in both of their phones support there was a sexual relationship.'

Simon was held at the Kent County Correctional Facility before the hearing today.

Her attorney Michael Distel asked that she be released on a personal recognizance bond.

Distel cited Simon's clean record and supportive family and told the judge that she does not pose flight risk.

The judge Patricia Schaefer noted that Simon has contacted the boy after being warned to stay away from him by police, and set her bail at $25,000.

Simon posted bail this afternoon and is staying with her parents in Grand Blanc.

Schaefer told Simon that she cannot contact the alleged victim or be within four blocks of him in any direction.

A probable-cause hearing is August 23.
