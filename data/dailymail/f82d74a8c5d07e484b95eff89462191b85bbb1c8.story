TV presenter Laura Csortan has been ridiculed for her alleged penchant for photoshopping Instagram snaps.

Despite her denials, at least the former Great Outdoors presenter can know she is in good company.

Her fellow accused include the likes of Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and home grown supermodel Miranda Kerr, all of whom have come under fire for appearing to tweak their pictures.

Hashtag no filter? Miranda Kerr is among a host of stars accused of using photo editing tools to appear slimmer in her Instagram pictures

While many Instagram users are guilty of adding a flattering filter to their selfies, it seems the stars are taking it a step further, and using photo editing tools to appear thinner.

Miranda Kerr has twice been accused of needlessly slimming down her waist in pictures posted to her Instagram account.

In 2013 the supermodel attended a Michael Kors event in Japan wearing a cut-out gown, but raised eyebrows when she uploaded a picture in which her already slender waist appeared noticeably smaller.

In another incident, the 31-year-old issued an apology for posting a picture which she claims she did not realise had been photoshopped. 

Miranda shared a picture of herself with her then fellow Victoria's Secret Angels Doutzen Kroes and 

Alessandra Ambrosio backstage at the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

But some of her 5.5million followers were quick to point out that her waist appeared significantly thinner than in the original photograph.

When Kim Kardashian took a trip to the Versace house in March 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right, in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips

British reality star Lauren Goodger has been accused of smoothing her waist to appear thinner, as shown in this picture posted when she attended the Clothes Show last year 

After making headlines around the world and a facing an army of fans questioning why the incredibly slim and fit star would need to photoshop her body, Miranda said in a statement: 'When I re-posted the photo this week to support the girls I screen grabbed it off the internet when I was working in Japan. I had no idea it was Photoshopped.'

For her part, Laura Csortan has flat-out denied slimming down her body in her Instagram pictures, despite obvious signs of tweaking such as blurring and skewed lines appearing in the snaps.

She has previously told Daily Mail Australia she uses filters, Instagram settings and occasionally a blemish remover app.

Beyonce is no stranger to  controversy, she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap, taken whilst she was holidaying in the South of France, it looked like her waist was slimmer

These two photos were taken just two days apart whilst Geordie Shore personality Charlotte Crosby holidayed in Perth in February, in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her Instagram snap

'Apart from using the filters on Instagram, I have never altered any of my pictures,' she has said. 

British reality stars such as Charlotte Crosby and Lauren Goodger have previously posted pictures to the social networking site where they look considerably smaller than in paparazzi pictures of them taken on the same day.  

Of course, stars like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs.

When singer Beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to Instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs. 

And when Kim took a trip to the Versace house last year the picture she posted to the social networking site made her look thinner than those taken of her by the photographers waiting outside. 

They say the camera never lies, but some seem to be telling a few fibs. Here are some more stars that might have been given a helping hand...  

In these pictures of Britney Spears, which were taken on the same day in November, she looks considerably slimmed down in the picture on the right which was posted to her Instagram

Holly Hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year, however, she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to Instagram (right) around the same time that she attended the NTAs (left)

Jennifer Lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filer to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted The Box Next Door in January
