Tierney Hinde, pictured with son Presley, suffered a nightmare Pontins holiday

A young mother has told how her first holiday away with her son was ruined after she discovered blood splattered on her chalet windows and mould throughout.  

Tierney Hinde, 28, from Dartford, Kent, was disgusted with the state of her Pontins apartment, with the nightmare starting when she discovered the dirty bed linen.

Things got worse when she was offered a different room on a higher floor with blood-spattered windows at the resort in Camber, East Sussex.

'It was supposed to be the first trip with my son but it was a farce that's all I can say,' said Ms Hinde.

'I nearly cried. I don't really get like that but it was just a complete waste of time.'

She chose Pontins over other resorts because the locks on the doors would provide security for autistic son Presley, four, who has a tendency to wander off.

The windows were cleaned off but Tierney was still unhappy because being higher up meant more danger for Presley.

As she predicted the youngster, who has poor co-ordination, fell down the landing steps, although no fault has been attributed to Pontins for this.

Tierney was also disappointed by the lack of activities available for Presley.

She said: 'Pontins should be getting involved with all of the kids and it wasn't like that at all.

'All he wanted to do was go towards the arcades because there was nothing else for him.

'I went there when I was 15 and nothing had changed since then and they were supposed to have had a rebirth in 2011.'

The mould in the bathroom added to the young mum's worry, and she requested to move rooms

Tierney was so upset that she gave up on her week-long trip, which cost £500, after three days.

She has since been offered 50 per cent off vouchers and VIP treatment on her next stay, but refuses to step foot in the resort again.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Pontins, and is awaiting comment.
