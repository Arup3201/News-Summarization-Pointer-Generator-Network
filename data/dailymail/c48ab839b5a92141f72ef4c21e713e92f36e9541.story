A teenager has told how her mother must feed her through her heart every night just to keep her alive.

Jodie Vasquez, 18, has a connective tissue disorder that means she faces constant pain and needs a wheelchair as her joints dislocate easily.

Her mother, Maxine Farish, has the daunting task of drip feeding vital nutrients through a tube going directly to her daughter's heart.

She knows that every time she administers the nutrients, one mistake could be fatal.

Inspirational: Teenager Jodie Vasquez, 18, from Carlisle, is fighting the rare condition Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and can only be fed through a tube into her heart

Jodie, of Carlisle, Cumbria, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type III (EDS), a disorder that affects the collagen in the body and can also interfere with the way internal organs, nerves and muscles work.

Since her diagnosis three years ago, the teenager's life has been turned upside down and, as she watches her twin sister, Emma, live life to the full, Jodie knows her time may sadly be limited.

Jodie has been in and out of hospital and has had to undergo more than a dozen operations and has not eaten since 2009, instead taking nutrients via an intravenous drip.

Every day she deals with intense pain and needs a wheelchair to get about as her joints dislocate easily and she suffers from chronic fatigue.

But the inspirational teenager today said she refuses to let the illness take over her life and revealed she is determined to remain positive and raise awareness.

'I don't know how long life will be, but I have got the condition for a reason and I just have to fight it and keep happy,' she explained.

'My family have been amazingly supportive and they have really helped me all the way.

'It can be difficult to watch my sister do things I should also be doing as an 18-year-old, but I'm glad it's me that has EDS so Emma doesn't have to go through what I do.'

From the age of 14 it started to become clear that something was seriously wrong with Jodie's health.

She began to suffer severe cramping pains, sickness and a loss of appetite.

However, it took a year before a definitive diagnosis was made.

The youngster was seen by medics at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary and, following a series of tests and examinations, Jodie was transferred to experts at the Royal London Hospital where she was told she had EDS.

It is estimated the illness affects one in every 5,000 people in the UK. No two cases of EDS are the same and the type Jodie has is unusual and serious as it damages internal organs.

EDS is often an inherited disease and research shows that around three quarters of sufferers have a family history of the illness.

Jodie said: 'When I was diagnosed with the condition it was such a relief to finally know what was wrong with me and have some answers.

'It was upsetting when I was told the condition couldn't be fixed, but I feel it's important to look forward and remain positive.'

Jodie has severe complex intestinal failure, has had her large bowel removed and a permanent stoma bag fitted, her small intestine has stopped working, her stomach doesn't function and her bladder has failed.

It was hoped she would be able to get a five-organ transplant but doctors have said she would not survive the surgery.

As the teenager cannot tolerate food she has not eaten since 2009 and is fed intravenously into the heart by a Total Parental Nutrition tube (TPN), however, this comes with serious risks including septicaemia and liver disease.

'It is really scary to get the TPN and each time it's terrifying to think what could happen,' explained Jodie.

'It is hard not to eat - I do miss chocolate and pasta and I get weird cravings. But the pain I get with the illness is worse than the not eating.'

Her mum Maxine, 47, who is married to Stephen, 44, an HGV driver, said: 'Jodie's diagnosis was life-changing and our whole world revolves around her illness and the care she needs.

'She is the epitome of courage in the face of adversity. Jodie is a true inspiration and I am so proud of her and how well she copes with everything.

'Every day it's heartbreaking as I'm always checking on Jodie, just as you would a baby. But you have to live life and make the most of it.'
