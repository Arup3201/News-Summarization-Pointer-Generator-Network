The man at the centre of a network that influenced the ISIS executioner identified as 'Jihadi John' was allowed to fly in and out of London to terrorism hot spots unchecked for almost three years.

Bilal al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells.

Over that period he was rising to prominence as a senior member of al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda linked group in Somalia - returning to the UK only to raise funds and to marry.

It is believed that it was during these return visits to London that al-Berjawi became the driving force behind the radicalisation of 27-year-old Mohammed Emwazi, using his growing stature within the terror group to radicalise homegrown extremists.

Emwazi was today named as terror suspect 'Jihadi John', the black cloaked executioner who featured in the beheading videos of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. 

According to people who have moved in jihadi circles in west London, Emwazi began to be noticed 'five or six years ago', when al-Berjawi was still flying between the UK and Africa.

'That's when he emerged, so to speak,' said one. 

Bilal al-Berjawi  was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago.

By that point he was a key figure in al-Qaeda's East African operations.

Originally from Lebanon, Berjawi first joined militants in Somalia in 2006 and then returned to Britain in 2007 on a fundraising venture.

He left again in February 2009 with his friend Mohammed Sakr, who is of Egyptian origin, to travel to Kenya, telling their families they were going on a safari - the same front used by Mohammed Emwazi when he flew to Tanzania in 2009.

They aroused the suspicions of the manager of the hotel at which they were staying in Mombasa and when they moved to Nairobi, police raided the premises and they were deported.

A laptop found at the premises contained extremist material including encouragement of jihad and instructions on making car bombs.

Berjawi married a Somali woman in London, and in October 2009, they decided to slip out of the country again, without telling their families that they were leaving.

All three were the subject of a manhunt, accused of crossing into Uganda to plot terrorist attacks that culminated in bomb attacks in Kampala in July 2011 that killed 74 people.

Berjawi was said to be a senior figure with al-Qaeda in East Africa, a radical part of the al-Shabaab movement, and was known as one of its most active fighters.

He was also responsible for securing weapons and for overseeing the contingent of foreign fighters.

In an online obituary published in 2013, al-Shabaab said 'Abu Hafs' had been trained by two top military commanders of al-Qaeda in East Africa, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.

The government stripped both men of their British passports and they were killed in separate drone attacks in 2012.

Court documents relating to Mohammed Emwazi today showed that Emwazi was part of an extremist network linked to al-Shabaab, the BBC reported.

MI5 files stated that his name was one of several terror suspects believed to be aiding the Somali terror cell in their provision of funds and equipment.
