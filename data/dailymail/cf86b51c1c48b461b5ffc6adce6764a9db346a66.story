Pilot Georgina Sutton has flown through the glass ceiling to be appointed as Australia's first female chief pilot.

Jetstar appointed Ms Sutton to the role, saying she's just one of a few woman chief pilots working for a major airline anywhere in the world.

Ms Sutton is currently the Qantas Boeing 767 fleet captain for domestic and international operations and will replace current chief pilot Captain Mark Rindfleish in February.

Jetstar Australia and New Zealand chief executive David Hall said Ms Sutton was chosen from a field of high calibre candidates.

'We are delighted that Captain Georgina Sutton will join us early next year as chief pilot after being successful against a number of high calibre internal and external candidates,' he said.

The former police officer worked as a gliding instructor before becoming a commercial pilot, working in South Australia and the Northern Territory.

Ms Sutton is also a qualified air safety investigator.
