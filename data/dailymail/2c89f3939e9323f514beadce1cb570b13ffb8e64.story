As she prepares to take on the role of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, actress Rachel Griffiths has revealed her own opinions about the struggles Australian women have to face both in government and in society.

'We need more women on top and our girls do need more strong role models,' she told Sunday Style.

'(My daughter) Adelaide said to me the other day, 'Why do they only show boys' sports on television? It's so annoying!' And that's out of the mouth of an eight-year-old!'

The upcoming telemovie, Stalking Julia is in pre-production and is based on Kerry-Anne Walsh’s book The Stalking of Julia Gillard: How the Media and Team Rudd Brought Down the Prime Minister.

Ms Griffiths will play our first female Prime Minister during her controversial three years in office.

Rachel Griffiths says she was shocked to see a recent survey reveal Australia 'well down' on the list of countries for working women

Two years ago Griffiths, her husband and their three young children returned to live in Melbourne after around a decade in the US.

Griffiths says that the statistics actually prove that Australia's treatment of women is worse than in many other countries.

‘I read an extraordinary survey that showed Australia was well down the list of best places to be a working woman. It was all empirical – it’s not my opinion,' she told Sunday Style. 'It’s based on pay, on promotion, on family-friendly policies, on some areas still being culturally anti-female.

She says that the conditions are made too difficult for most women to enter into Australia politics. 

‘I get cross that some very talented women I know who would have been brilliant in office have been approached and are consciously saying no.'

Griffiths, who will play former Prime Minister Julia GIllard in Stalking Julia, says parliament is not where 'any smart, successful woman I know really chooses to go and make a difference'

Griffiths has never been afraid to make her political beliefs known.

In March this year, she appeared on ABC’s Q and A and said that parliament is ‘not where any smart, successful woman I know really chooses to go and make a difference’.

Griffiths was arrested in 1997, when she went topless to protest the opening of the Crown Casino in Melbourne whilst she was attending the casino’s opening party. 

At the time, Rachel Griffiths said that the Victorian government, which was being led by Premier Jeff Kennett, had ‘succeeded in raping our state of its dignity, compassion and sense of community.’ 

When asked why she had chosen to protest in this manner, she told a journalist ‘if I didn’t flash my tits, you wouldn’t have put me in the papers'.

The 44-year-old Aussie actress is currently starring in Channel Nine's House Husbands and is in a campaign for Sportscraft.

She and her family, including her two daughters, Adelaide and Clementine and her son, Banjo, are here to stay.
