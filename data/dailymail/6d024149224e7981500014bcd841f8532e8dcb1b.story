This year's super-smart Spelling Bee contestants have told how the event - which kicked off today - enables them to bond with other like-minded children.

'Other
 people will think we're nerdy and weird,' 14-year-old Kate Miller from 
Abilene, Texas, told the Associated Press. She is at the nationals in Washington, D.C., for 
the third time and has a tight circle of friends from previous years.

She continued: 'The smart kids, when we go home, we don't always have a place where we're with our own kind and so this is a place where we can really connect and stay in touch, and rejoice through happy times and help each other in the hard times.'

Just like universities have social clubs, the Spelling Bee has its own collection of groups suited to different personalities.

For instance, Kate is a member of The
 Order of the Squushy Carrots. That's where she met her good friend, 
12-year-old Katharine Wang who lives in Morristown, New Jersey.

The
 Order came into being several years ago - it even has its own logo and theme song - 
and has become one of the more popular social media groups that helps 
spellers stay in touch during the 51 weeks of the year when they aren't 
at the Bee.

'It's just really fun meeting all the people who are there and just having fun with your friends'

Another
 group is the Ghetto-pens - whose name is 'something only spelling geeks
 would get,' according to member Jae Canetti of Reston, Virginia.

It's actually a play on 'guetapens' (pronounced GEHT'-uh-pahns), the winning word from the 2012 Bee.

There are only about seven in the group, and they keep in touch about school, friends, family.

Jae, 12, who is also making his third Bee appearance, revealed that the main topic that spellers try to avoid when they're just 
casually talking to each other is spelling.

'Just like professional athletes - they
 don't wear their team jersey around,' he said.

In
 the spirit of inclusiveness, the groups include spellers who are 
serious contenders along with those who would be happy to make it out of
 the preliminaries.

Twelve-year-old Vanya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, tied for fifth 
last year and is vying to become the second half of the first sibling 
tandem of champions. (Her sister Kavya won in 2009.)

Vanya, a spelling 
social butterfly, is both a Ghetto-pen and a Squushy Carrot.

'I mean, we're in the Spelling Bee. We ARE nerdy and weird'

'It's just really fun meeting all the people who are there,' Vanya said, 'and just having fun with your friends.'

Kate and Katharine wondered aloud what the public would think of the Squushy Carrots or Google Group - another circle they belong too.

'Other people will think we're nerdy and weird,' Kate said.

While Katharine replied laughing: 'I mean, we're in the Spelling Bee. We ARE nerdy and weird.'

The Bee began Tuesday morning with a computerized spelling and 
vocabulary test, with onstage rounds starting Wednesday on the way to 
Thursday's prime-time finals.

They are among 281 competitors ages eight to 15 vying this week for the title of top speller in the English language.
