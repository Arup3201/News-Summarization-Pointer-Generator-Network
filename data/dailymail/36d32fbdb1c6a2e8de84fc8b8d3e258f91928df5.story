A business professor is on leave from his faculty position after news broke that he’s under investigation for child molestation charges.

Shocked: Prof. Kenneth Charles Robinson is charged with molesting a 14-year-old girl and turned himself in for the Thanksgiving incident but denies he touched the girl

Though he denies the charges, Dr. Kenneth Charles Robinson turned himself in to police March 1.

The professor was released the next day on a $100,000 bond, but his university somehow did not learn of the charges until this week.

In a statement Wednesday, Kennesaw State University officials maintained they’d only recently learned of the charges against the associate professor.

The statement also acknowledged the Georgia school learned of the charges through media coverage rather than through, presumably, Robinson himself.

‘An inquiry by an Atlanta media outlet has brought to light criminal charges filed,’ begins the statement on the university’s website. ‘Robinson has been placed on administrative leave from his faculty position, pending further review.’

The allegations stem from a November 23 incident when police were called to the home where Robinson was staying with an unidentified woman and her 14-year-old daughter.

According to the police report, an argument earlier that evening ensued between the woman and her daughter, who was upset with her mother for drinking too much that night and not spending time with her.

After the fight, the girl told police, Robinson entered her room and tried to talk to her about the argument.

She said that’s when Robinson began to scratch her back under her shirt and eventually placed his hand under her pants and touched her buttocks.

The girl later woke her mother and told her of the incident.

Another fight ensued, this time between the woman and Robinson, and police were called.

No arrest happened that night and it remains unclear why charges have only this month been made against Robinson.

What is clear, however, is that Robinson is maintaining his innocence in the matter.

In his version of events, Robinson told police it was the girl who entered his room to talk about her problems with her mother and that he even asked her to leave.

Robinson’s attorney, George M. Weaver, maintained his client’s innocence in a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

‘Dr. Robinson strongly denies the charges,’ Weaver said. ‘We expect that he will be fully exonerated.’

Robinson received his Ph.D. from the University of Georgia and teaches in the Kennesaw State University’s management and entrepreneurship program.

He stands charged with child molestation and sexual battery of a minor.
