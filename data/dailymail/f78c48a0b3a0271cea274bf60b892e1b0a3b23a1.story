The Royal and Ancient  has voted to allow women members for the first time in its 260-year history.

The club in St Andrews, Fife, known as the 'home of golf', voted by a simple majority in favour of allowing women members.

Around 85 per cent of the club's 2,500 global members said they thought women should be able to join.

The Royal & Ancient  has voted in favour of allowing women to become members, after 260 years of only men

Peter Dawson, secretary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A), said: 'I am very pleased indeed to announce that the membership of the R&A of St Andrews has voted overwhelmingly in favour of welcoming women members.

'More than three quarters of the club's global membership took part in the ballot, with a decisive 85 per cent voting for women to become members.

'This vote has immediate effect and I can confirm that the R&A of St Andrews is now a mixed membership club.'

It had been widely expected that members would back their committees'  call to move with the times, but it was by no means a foregone conclusion.

Last year, members of Royal Burgess golf club in Edinburgh were presented with a similar opportunity, but voted 69-64 against admitting women.

The R&A had resisted moves to admit women to its membership, but matters escalated when major Open Championship sponsor HSBC said it was uncomfortable with the major being held at an exclusively male club.

While the R&A's members have access to the clubhouse behind the first tee at the Old Course, they belong to a club, not a golf course. The seven golf courses at St Andrews are open to the public. 

Around 85 per cent of the club's 2,500 global membership voted in favour of the change 

Earlier this year, Professor Louise Richardson, the first woman principal of St Andrews University, spoke out against the ban on women.

She has until now been denied honorary membership of the club, an honour given to her predecessors in the post.

Professor Richardson claimed the snub meant she was unable to entertain university donors at the clubhouse, traditionally an important part of the principal's role.

1734: The organisation is founded as The Society of St Andrews Golfers, a local golf club.

1834: King William IV becomes patron of the club, now known as the Royal and Ancient.

1893: Overcrowding leads to the club buying land off the town council for £5,000 to make another course. It is aptly named the New Course.

1897: The Jubilee Course, which has 12 holes, is built. Six holes are added in 1906.

1913: An Act of Parliament allows the club to charge green fees to people using the Old Course, allowing it to raise enough money to open a fourth course - the Eden.

2004: The club hands over its role as one of the governing authorities of the game to The R&A - a namesake group of companies.

2012: Gordon Brown calls on the club to abandon its policy on all-male membership.

2014: The club votes to allow female members, with 85 per cent of its 2,500-strong membership voting in favour of the change. 

Annika Sorenstam, the winner of 10 majors, is also expected to be among the first women to join the club. 

Mr Dawson added that there could now be certain women 'fast-tracked' into membership.

He said: 'The membership has also acted to fast-track a significant initial number of women to become members in the coming months.

'This is a very important and positive day in the history of the R&A.

'The R&A has served the sport of golf well for 260 years and I am confident that the club will continue to do so in future with the support of all its members, both women and men.'

Cabinet Secretary for Sport and Equalities Shona Robison said the decision was a 'step on the road' to full equality for women

Cabinet Secretary for Sport and Equalities Shona Robison has heralded the club's decision.

Miss Robison said: 'In the week before Scotland welcomes golf fans from across the world for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, this decision by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews to admit women members is another step on the road to full equality in sport and society.

'This decision by the world's most exclusive and prestigious golf club sees real progress towards making golf a more equal sport which is very important.

'We firmly believe that there should be no barriers at all to being involved in sport with everyone able to participate in and enjoy sport - whoever they are and whatever their background.

'I hope this welcome development leads to the few remaining single-gender golf clubs to take a similar path.' 

Three all-male clubs are on the British Open rotation - Royal St George's, Royal Troon and Muirfield - but they may soon also change their membership policies.

The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers is set to begin its review process on the issue of men-only membership at Muirfield, East Lothian, in late September.

There are also increasing signs of movement on the matter at Royal St George's in Sandwich, Kent, which hosted the 2011 Open.

South Ayrshire's Royal Troon - which is scheduled to stage the 2016 Open - appears to have no plans to move from single-sex membership.

However, it points out that the town's ladies club use the course - despite having their own clubhouse, captain and committee.
