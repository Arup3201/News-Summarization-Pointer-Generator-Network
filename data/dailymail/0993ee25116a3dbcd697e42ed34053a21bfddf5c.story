Nigella Lawson is believed to have had her U.S. travel ban overturned and is looking forward to filming the next series of The Taste

Nigella Lawson is believed to have had her U.S. travel ban overturned after it was imposed following her courtroom drug confession. 

It means the TV star will be allowed to fly to America this year to film the next series of The Taste. 

The 54-year-old has already put a call out on Twitter for aspiring chefs to apply for the show.

It is understood work on the third series will start in the autumn. 

Lawson was forced to abandon a trip to America in April after she was stopped from boarding a British Airways flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles. 

It came after the Domestic Goddess admitted during a fraud trial that she had taken cocaine on two occasions.

U.S. officials can stop foreigners who have committed drugs offences entering the country even if they have never been arrested and charged by police. 

Channel 4 has still not confirmed whether the UK's version of The Taste will be recommissioned due to poor ratings. 

A source told The People: 'It has been a torrid year for Nigella but now things are starting to come together. 

'She is happy about this. She can now continue her role on The Taste, something she enjoys immensely.'

Last July, Lawson divorced art collector Charles Saatchi after he was photographed grabbing her throat outside Scott's Restaurant, in Mayfair, central London.  

In December she testified at the fraud trial of two former aides Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo.

During the trial she said: 'I've never been a drug addict, I've never been a habitual user. There are two occasions in my life when I used cocaine.' 

According to Lawson, she took the drug with her late husband John Diamond who was terminally ill with cancer and who died in 2001. 

Police later said they would not investigate the matter any further.

At the time Lawson's co-host on The Taste, chef Anthony Bourdain, tweeted that he was 'absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of U.S. actions' over Lawson's travel.

Bourdain said in an email that Lawson was 'the most focused, non-party, sober person I know. How this could happen — to her, of all people — is beyond me.'

She is not the first British celebrity to fall afoul of U.S. immigration officials.

In 2008 the late singer Any Winehouse, who had a marijuana arrest and well-publicised problems with alcohol and drugs, was refused a visa to perform at the Grammy Awards.

Singer Lily Allen was denied a visa the same year, shortly after she was arrested over an altercation with photographers.

The MailOnline has contacted Nigella Lawson's agent and is awaiting a comment.
