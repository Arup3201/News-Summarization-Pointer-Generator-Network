Last season, Arsenal were top of the Premier League on Boxing Day. This season, they are 6th. Click here to read the five things the Gunners need to do to reach the top four 

Liverpool were runners-up in the Premier League last season, but this year they're struggling to break into the top half.

The sale of Luis Suarez and injury to Daniel Sturridge have seen them struggle to score goals, and defensive troubles have left them leaking goals.

After 17 games last season, Liverpool were top of the Premier League with 36 points. Now, they are 10th with 22.

Here, Sportsmail look at the five things they need to do to right their wrongs, and climb into the top four of the Premier League.

SEND FOR STURRIDGE 

Liverpool have a nine-point gap to make up if they want to gatecrash the Champions League placings and for that they need goals and more goals.

It is hardly rocket science to suggest a return to fitness for striker Sturridge would make a huge difference to a squad desperately short of forwards. He scored 24 times for Liverpool last season, remember.

Sturridge’s arrival would provide a psychological boost and surely Raheem Sterling will be especially delighted to have someone to provide the finishing touches to his runs and crosses.

MAKE HISTORY 

Liverpool have 22 points from 17 games this season. No side with that total has finished higher than sixth in Premier League history.

Boss Brendan Rodgers said after the draw against Arsenal on Sunday that a similar run to last year’s 11 wins on the spin could do it. Liverpool are tenth, seven points above the relegation zone.

They may be going in the right direction but that is a lot of catching up to do.

SIGN A CECH 

Simon Mignolet has been taken out of the firing line after his error-strewn season but Brad Jones is only ever going to be an interim measure.

Brendan Rodgers needs an experienced, reliable stopper between the posts and if Mignolet does not get his confidence back, then it might be worth a punt for someone in January, even on loan.

So how about Petr Cech, currently No 2 to Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea? Rodgers and Jose Mourinho are mates, after all.

FIND A WINNING FORMATION 

Rodgers has tweaked and fiddled this season, partly out of necessity and partly because most of his summer signings have struggled one way or the other. Has he accidentally stumbled on a winning formula with 3-4-3?

Stacking midfield seems to suit Lazar Markovic and it also gives Steven Gerrard a bit more room for manoeuvre, although it does put the defence under pressure.

Mamadou Sakho was hardly Mr Stability against Arsenal while Kolo Toure is off to the Africa Cup of Nations, which suggests Rodgers may have to get that chalkboard out again.

DISCOVER THE REAL DEJAN 

Anyone who saw Dejan Lovren play for Southampton and then for Liverpool would struggle to believe it was the same player.

The central defender has been a mistake waiting to happen since his summer move but this is someone who is usually comfortable on the ball and, in theory, perfectly qualified to slot into a 3-4-3.

The groin injury he picked up on Capital One Cup duty could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. It gives him a chance to re-group, which should be to Liverpool’s gain because he is a class act.
