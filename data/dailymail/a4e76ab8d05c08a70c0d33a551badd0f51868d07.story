Mario Balotelli has been made Liverpool's featured player for January in their official 2015 calendar – saving them any embarrassment if he doesn't stay at Anfield for the rest of the year.

The release of the club's official calendar could provide important clues into how Liverpool see the squad developing in the next 12 months. Each month is accompanied by a large picture of a particular player and nobody wants Liverpool fans to turn over to a new month later in the year to see a player no longer with them.

Steven Gerrard, who is out of contract at the end of the season and hasn't decided whether he wants to stay, is featured as the main picture for March when he certainly will still be with his hometown club.

UNCERTAIN FUTURE

January - Mario Balotelli

Februrary – Simon Mignolet

March – Steven Gerrard

April – Mamadou Sakho

May – Martin Skrtel

June – Philippe Coutinho

July – Jordan Henderson

HERE TO STAY 

August – Dejan Lovren

September – Daniel Sturridge

October – Raheem Sterling

November – Alberto Moreno

December – Rickie Lambert

But, significantly, Raheem Sterling is held back until October. The 20-year-old has been linked to other clubs including Real Madrid following a blistering start to the season but he is tied down to a long-term contract at Anfield and his position in the calendar suggests the club will play hardball over his future in the summer and keep him, as they did when Arsenal bid for Luis Suarez in 2013.

Balotelli, 24, has endured a torrid time on Merseyside since a much-hyped £16million move from AC Milan in August. He has yet to score a Premier League goal for his new club and is currently facing FA charges in connection with a social media post that allegedly contained racist and anti-semitic content, something the player strongly denies.

Given the paucity of striking resources at Liverpool, manager Brendan Rodgers is prepared to give the Italian another chance when he returns from a groin injury and re-evaluate his future in the summer. But the reality is if Liverpool unexpectedly receive an offer in January that allows them to recoup their outlay, they would listen carefully.

With Luis Suarez gone, Rodgers has only had Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini available up front because of injuries to Daniel Sturridge and Borini. Belgian ace Divock Origi is on loan to Lille and due to return for next season.

Liverpool, Premier League runners-up last season, are currently in ninth position and need to beat Basle on Tuesday night to stay in the Champions League.

The recent malaise at Anfield is underlined by the fact that three of the six players on the cover of the calendar – Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Sterling – are in contract talks, Balotelli's woes are well-documented and Daniel Sturridge has hardly played this season because of injury. The sixth player featured is Philippe Coutinho.
