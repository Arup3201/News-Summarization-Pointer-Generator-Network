Angela Merkel has urged Germans not to attend protest by the newly established campaign group PEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, saying they have 'hatred in their hearts'

Anglea Merkel has today urged Germans to shun protests calling for an end to the 'Islamisation of Europe' saying  that religious intolerance has no place in modern Germany.

Speaking after last night's march in Dresden drew 18,000 people on to the streets, the German Chancellor accused activists of having hatred in their hearts, while a campaign by daily newspaper Bild called for an end to 'xenophobia' in society.

The front page of today's Bild newspaper was covered in statements from 50 prominent Germans, including Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, rockstar Udo Lindenberg, and former German soccer captain Oliver Bierhoff, denouncing the political movement. 

As demonstrators from grassroots movement PEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, waved German flags and shouted slogans yesterday the lights around Cologne Cathedral and the Brandenberg Gate in Berlin were extinguished in a symbolic gesture of opposition.   

PEGIDA marches have become a weekly event in the eastern city of Dresden, but have recently spread to Cologne and Berlin, though yesterday the number of protesters were vastly outnumbered by pro-immigration activists.

Last night in Cologne the square around Cologne Cathedral - one of Germany's most famous landmarks - was plunged into darkness as part of a symbolic gesture against the demonstrations.

In Berlin, the floodlights at the Brandenburg Gate were switched off, while the lights were also extinguished at the city's iconic TV Tower. Lights on the bridges which cross the Rhine were also switched off.

Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, said that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the demonstrators think twice about their protest.

'You're taking part in an action that, from its roots and also from speeches, one can see is Nazi-ist, racist and extremist,' he told n-tv. 'And you're supporting people you really don't want to support.'

Other buildings, including several other churches and a museum, joined the Cologne Cathedral in shutting off their lights. 

In the eastern city Dresden - which has been at the centre of the weekly rallies since they began in October -  Volkswagen decided to keep its glass-walled manufacturing plant dark, to demonstrate that the company 'stands for an open, free and democratic society.' 

The latest wave of protests came just days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel used her New Year's Day message to spurn the rallies which she views as racist. 

In defiance of her words, some 18,000 people turned out in Dresden, carrying signs with slogans such as 'wake up'.

The crowd also chanted 'we are the people' and 'lying press' as they passed television cameras and waved Germany's black, red and gold flag. They also brandished posters bearing slogans such as 'Against religious fanaticism and every kind of radicalism'.

Around 18,000 people gathered in Dresden last night for one of the group's weekly marches as protests also spread to Berlin and Cologne (pictured) where the lights were turned out on the city's cathedral as a symbolic gesture of opposition 

The blanket of darkness which descended across Germany was designed to be a sign of solidarity against protests by the group Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West

Despite the Dresden march drawing a record crowd of 18,000, in Cologne there were only a few hundred marchers who were easily outnumbered by pro-immigration campaigners 

One poster  called for 'potatoes rather than doner kebabs', a swipe at ethnic Turks who at around three million represent Germany's largest immigrant community.

But similar rallies in Berlin and the western city of Cologne were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance. 

Only about 250 PEGIDA supporters showed up in Cologne - home to a large Muslim population - compared to about ten times that number of counter-demonstrators.

PEGIDA was even forced to call off its demonstration early, after organisers reported being blocked from marching along their planned route, police said.

Similarly in Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 PEGIDA supporters from marching along their planned route from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate. 

Some 18,000 anti-immigrant protesters marched through the streets of Dresden in the lastest round of demonstrations about what they say is the growing influence of Islam

The rallies, attended by opponents of Germany's immigration and asylum policies, have become an almost weekly event in the east German city of Dresden in recent months 

Justice Minister Heiko Maas said at the Berlin counter-demonstration: ''Germany is a country where refugees are welcome and the silent majority must not remain silent but rather go out onto the streets and show itself,.' 

In Stuttgart, where there were not even a planned protest, there were reports of 8,000 people demonstrating against the movement.

The increase in counter-protests came following Mrs Merkel's New Year's address, in which she urged Germans to stay away from the Dresden rallies.

'We need to ... say that right-wing extremism, hostility towards foreigners and anti-Semitism should not be allowed any place in our society,' Merkel said on Monday in the eastern town of Neustrelitz. 

But some of the protestors, including in Berlin (pictured), were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters, including these from the Alliance against Racism, who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance 

Members of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) also joined the counter protest in Berlin, where police said just 300 anti-immigration protesters turned up 

One person in Cologne - where just 250 anti-immigrant demonstrators turned up - waved a flag saying 'I love immigration'  

German Justice Minister Heiko Maas (centre) and Berlin's Integration Senator Dilek Kolat (right) also joined the demonstration in Berlin to protest against a rally by the mounting right-wing populist movement

But, at Monday's rally, PEGIDA organizer Kathrin Oertel slammed the speech, telling the crowd 'in Germany we have political repression again.'

'Or how would you see it when we are insulted or called racists or Nazis openly by all the political mainstream parties and media for our justified criticism of Germany's asylum seeker policies and the non-existent immigration policy,' she asked the cheering crowd. 

Germany has some of the world's most liberal asylum rules, partly due to its Nazi past. The number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany, many from the Middle East, jumped to around 200,000 last year -- four times as many as in 2012. 

But PEGIDA has unsettled Germany's political establishment. The first protest in October was attended by just a few hundred people, but the movement quickly snowballed. 

Since then, PEGIDA has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated.' 

Supports of the left-wing group 'Die Linke' held up a poster reading 'Refugees welcome! Against racism and right-wing violence' in Berlin

In Rostock, north east Germany, hundreds turned out in a show of solidarity against the anti-immigrant campaigns 

In Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 PEGIDA supporters from marching along their planned route

The protestors were planning on marching from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate but were blocked by those campaigning against the protest

'PEGIDA is for resistance against an anti-woman political ideology that emphasizes violence, but not against integrated Muslims living here,' the group said.

It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, though critics have noted the praise and support it has received from known neo-Nazi groups.

Their leaders have singled out Muslim immigrants in their speeches, but the movement has broadened into one against immigrants from all backgrounds. 

A particular target has been 'economic refugees', or asylum seekers who they say are seeking a better standard of living in Germany.

The highest number yet of participants took part in a demonstration called by anti-immigration group PEGIDA in Dresden, seen as the birthplace of the movement
