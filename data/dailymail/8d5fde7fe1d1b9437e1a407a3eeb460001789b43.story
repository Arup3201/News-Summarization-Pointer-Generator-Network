The instant messaging war is well and truly upon us.

Following major announcements from Facebook, Vine, Bebo and others, Snapchat has revealed its own ‘chat’ feature.

Users within the popular image-sharing app can now message friends and make live video calls.

Snapchat has unveiled its new messaging service that allows you to talk to other users. You can also now share live video with them (pictured) to make quick and instant calls

The update for the app is being released today on iOS and Android.

The new feature, dubbed Chat, continues Snapchat’s theme of being quick, easy and simple.

With just a swipe you’ll be able to privately message your friends.

To use Chat, you simply load up the app as usual.

When in your Snapchat inbox, you then swipe right on a friend’s name to send then a written message.

The messages work like a regular Snap, and will be deleted after both of you have seen it and quit your respective chat screens.

There is a button that lets you save important information, though, or of course you can always take a screenshot.

If you and your friend happen to be chatting at the same time the app will alert you by saying they are ‘Here’ on the screen.

Then, pressing and holding the screen will let you chat face to face instantly.

Holding the top of the screen will show your friend the view out of the camera on the back of your phone.

Touching the bottom of the screen will switch to the front camera, so you can show them a quick video selfie if you want.

The latest update follows the previous change, which added Stories to Snapchat.

This enabled users to have an image on their profile available for viewing for 24 hours.

The chat feature, though, seems to be a clear rebuttal to moves from Snapchat’s rivals.

Facebook, Vine, Bebo and possible even Twitter have all made moves in the instant messaging field in the past few months.

Snapchat's move seems to be an attempt to ensure they hang onto their chunk of the lucrative photo and text communication market.

At the end of 2013 it was estimated that Snapchat had over 26 million users in the US alone, with many others around the world.

And in a survey of American college students in February, 77% said they used Snapchat on a daily basis.

But the company still apparently holds only 5% of the 'selfie' market, with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game.

To use Snapchat's new Chat feature (pictured) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend's names in the app's inbox. Messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window

You can activate the front (left) and rear (right) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively

Back
 in February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for 
$19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to 
buy Snapchat.

At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other.

This
 directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get 
back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service.

Facebook,
 meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app,
 with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native 
messaging client.

They recently announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself.

And
 even Twitter is getting in on the game – it’s rumoured they are 
considering letting users have secret conversations on the site.
