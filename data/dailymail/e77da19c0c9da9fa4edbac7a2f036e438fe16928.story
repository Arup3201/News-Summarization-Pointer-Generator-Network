It weighs as much as a bowling ball and you would have to run three marathons to burn off its 7,000 calories.

So perhaps it is no surprise that the Ogre Burger - described as Britain's largest - has yet to be eaten in one sitting.

Visitors to The Edge Bar in Basildon, Essex, are challenged to tackle the monstrous tower, receiving their meal for free if they consume it within thirty minutes.

Beast: Two challengers pictured with the Ogre Burger, which contains 7,000 calories and is equivalent to eight normal quarter pounders

The huge meal contains one kilogram of beef, an 800g bun, 500g of salad, 200g of cheese, onion rings and a plate of chips on the side.

Taking over two hours to create, the meal is equivalent to eight average quarter pounder burgers.

Those who attempt to finish the burger but fail have their picture displayed on a 'Wall of Shame' behind the bar.

Chef Adam Wood said that some of the UK's 'best eaters' have already tackled his creation but have come up short every time.

The 28-year-old said that the best 
challenger still walked away with a quarter of the burger uneaten, 
claiming it is the biggest in the UK.

He said: 'No one will ever eat it. I've seen some of Britain's best eaters already fail.

'I will eat my hat if someone does finish the dish. In fact, I'll pay for the burger myself.

'Here at Edge Bar we do not promote overeating but we encourage competition.'

Nine challengers took on the meal, costing Â£10, on Tuesday evening.

But needless to say, they all went home with their wallets slightly lighter.
