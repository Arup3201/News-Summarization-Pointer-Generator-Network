A mechanic appears to have predicted the circumstances surrounding his own death when he died from a heart attack after completing work on converting a VW campervan into a hearse.

Mick McDonald, 50, had joked that the job would 'be the death of him' but then he became the first person to use it.

Mr McDonald had carried out the work for his friend Carl Bell's business, Retro Farewell.

After the fatal cardiac arrest he was driven for his own funeral from Crake and Mallon Funeral Services in Stockton-on-Tees to Acklam crematorium in Middlesbrough.

Mr Bell said: 'That was always his line, he would 
always joke that I worked him too hard and the campervan would be the 
end of him.

'That's what's so ironic about him dying and now he is the first person to use the hearse on his final day.'

Mr
Bell has been hiring out another VW campervan for weddings for some 
time. After seeing how happy the quirky vehicle made people, he decided 
to create a hearse version, and asked McDonald to help him tart up a 
rusty old turquoise combie van.

'I get a great reaction from people 
when I use it, I get smiles and waves from the public, it just makes 
people happy,' the 42-year-old Middlesborough man said.

'I thought I could use it on someone's final day, the hearse isn't black, it's white, and makes funerals a bit less sad.'

Mr McDonald,
a mechanic who restored cars for a living, was happy to help but after 
completing the project suffered a fatal heart attack, which devastated 
his family and friends.

'What
you saw was what you got with Mick, he was a funny guy, he wouldn't 
harm anyone and it's just a shame that he's gone,' Mr Bell said.

'It just not something you would expect, he didn't smoke or drink and he was a fit guy, he worked constantly,'

Mr
Bell thought using the campervan hearse at Mr McDonald's funeral would be a
fitting tribute, and he reckons his best mate would have loved the 
attention.

'I
thought to myself, is it insensitive to mention the campervan to his 
family? But his partner Lynn was over the moon with the idea - she 
actually thanked me in her speech at the crematorium, so I think it was
a very good celebration of his life.'
