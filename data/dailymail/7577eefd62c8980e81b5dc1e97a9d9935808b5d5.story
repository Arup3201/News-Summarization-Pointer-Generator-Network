A young mother who tricked a Royal Marine into believing that he was the father of her baby and paying out thousands of pounds in child maintenance has failed to get her prison sentence overturned.

The conned Marine treated the baby girl as his own daughter for five years before the mother's web of lies unraveled.

The mother even lied about the results of a paternity test when he sought reassurance that the baby was his.

She was jailed for six months at Newport Crown Court after admitting two counts of fraud last month.

But yesterday she failed in a bid to be freed from jail early and allowed to return to her daughter at the Court of Appeal.

Appeal: The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, failed in her bid to get her six month jail term for fraud overturned at the Court of Appeal, pictured, yesterday

The court heard that the couple, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, had a 'brief relationship in 2006 but separated shortly before he was deployed to Afghanistan.

While he was serving on the frontline, his ex-girlfriend emailed him that she was pregnant with his child.

Despite his suspicions, the Marine 'accepted the child as his own' and began paying towards child support.

But he asked for proof that the child was his and demanded a paternity test in 2009.

The negative results were posted to the mother in Gwent, South Wales, and she lied by telling the father that the test proved the child was his.

But the truth finally came to light in 2011 when the Marine ordered the results of a second paternity test to be delivered direct to him.

In a victim impact statement he said that it was not the lost money which hurt him the most, but finding out that the child was not his.

He described it as like a 'bereavement' and had decided not to stay in touch with the little girl because he thought it would cause her difficulties in later life.

The mother said the fraud was not motivated by financial gain, but by wanting her daughter to have consistency in her life.

'We have no doubt that these offences justified the judge's conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate.'

Mr Justice Eder

She told judges that she initially believed the Marine was the father.

Justin Evans, defending, told Mr Justice Eder, Lord Justice Laws and Judge Michael Stokes at yesterday's appeal that prison had come as 'a crushing blow' to her.

He said her daughter had lost not only the person she thought was her dad - but also her mother for the six months prison sentence.

But Mr Justice Eder said the offences were too serious to justify cutting the sentence to release her.

He said: 'What is absolutely clear is that, at the very latest, the mother was well aware he wasn't the father from August 2009 when she received the results of the DNA test.

'There can be little doubt about the devastating effect the mother's actions have had on him and, in our view, these are important aggravating factors.

'We have no doubt that these offences justified the judge's conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate.

'We don't consider that the sentence imposed by the judge was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.'
