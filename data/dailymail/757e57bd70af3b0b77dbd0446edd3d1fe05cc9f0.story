A mother and daughter offered former News of the World investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood children as young as 13 for sex in return for £18,000, a court heard today.

Angela Martin, 46, told the undercover journalist she could provide 'anything you want' for cash during a series of secretly taped meetings.

During a series of meetings girls as young as 13 were paraded in front of Mahmood - famously dubbed the 'Fake Sheikh' - and made to hand over their discount travel cards as proof of their age.

He struck a deal with Martin and her 
daughter Natasha Martin, 24, to provide four teenagers for sex at a 
party at the luxury Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane, central London.

The women demanded he pay £6,000 for a 13-year-old Polish girl and £4,000 each for three other girls aged 14 and 15-years-old, a court was told.

At one point Angela was heard to say: 'I can get you anything you want, black, white, Indian, anything.'

But the women claim they lied about being able to provide the girls and said it was a ruse to get their hands on the reporter's money.

Both women are to be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to steal.

Prosecutor Emma Deacon told the court: 'In summary, it is a conspiracy to steal where the defendants intended to steal money from a man who they believed at the time to be a fixer for what were described as "wealthy Arab men".

'The defendants were going to pretend in return for substantial payment they had available, and would supply, underage girls prepared to engage in sexual activities with the men at the Dorchester Hotel.'

The court heard the two women met with Mahmood three times at the Premier Inn, in Barking, Essex.

Ms Deacon said Angela 'took the lead' in financial negotiations while Natasha Martin presented herself as 'being in charge of the girls' and had 'provided details of the sexual activities she could get the girls to engage in'.

The prosecutor said: 'At two of the meetings the defendants actually took girls along with them.

'At the final meeting the defendants turned up with four underage girls with a view to them being taken to the Dorchester with the idea being that they were to provide sexual services.

'The defendants intended to secure for these four girls £18,000 as that was what they had agreed with Mahmood.

'It's clear from the recordings that the defendants' motivation was their own dishonesty and greed.

'It is an aggravating feature that the defendants were prepared to use underage girls in this way for their own means.'

Ms Deacon said the first meeting took place on March 17, 2011, after Mahmood contacted the women in connection with a separate matter.

He had been told by a fellow reporter that Angela Martin could provide drugs couriers and women for arranged marriages, she said.

After that meeting he asked the other reporter to approach Angela Martin about underage prostitution and a second meeting was arranged for the following night.

Ms Deacon said: 'On March 18, they took with them two girls, a 15-year-old and a 14-year-old.

'They took them along to show to Mahmood on the basis that these were two of the girls willing to have sexual intercourse with men at the party.'

The court was shown video footage of the meeting taken by Mahmood in which Angela Martin is seen alone with the reporter discussing the girls.

She said: 'I can get you anything you want, black, white, Indian, anything.'Slim, chubby, pretty, ugly, whatever they want. [My daughter] is in control of all the girls.'

Natasha Martin is then brought into the room and Mahmood asks 'Will they s**g?', to which Angela replies: 'Yes they do.'

Ms Deacon said: 'Natasha Martin then goes on to give detail of what services the girls could provide, saying that they're "nasty little girls" and she has got girls who can do "dirty stuff".

'She says she can get a girl who is 13-years-old, a Polish girl.'

At another meeting six days later four girls are brought into the room and Angela Martin is heard talking to them about what they are going to do.

She says: 'We're going to the Dorchester and we're going to have fun. Does that sound good?'

When Mahmood asks them what fun means one of the girls replies 'sex'.

The pair admitted conspiracy to steal on the grounds they intended to take the reporter's money and run and did not intend for the young girls to engage in sexual activities with customers in September.

A charge of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the prostitution of children was ordered to lie on file after the prosecution accepted their guilty plea.

Angela Martin, of, Leytonstone, and Natasha Martin, Walthamstow, both east London, have both admitted to one charge of conspiracy to steal between March 16 and March 26, 2011.

The hearing continues.
