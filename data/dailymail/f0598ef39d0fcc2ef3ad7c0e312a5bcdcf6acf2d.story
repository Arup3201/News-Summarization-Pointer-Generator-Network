A new 30,000-seat football stadium will be named after America’s second largest private prison operator as part of a $6million (£3.92million) sponsorship deal.

Florida Atlantic University announced the partnership with GEO Group Inc, which runs 101 prison facilities with about 
73,000 beds, on Tuesday raising questions about the suitability of the 
match.

The university in Florida had been looking for a stadium sponsor for more than two years after spending $70million (£45.7million) building the major stadium, home of the Owls football team.

The donation from the prison company’s charitable foundation is the ‘largest one-time gift in the history of FAU athletics,’ the university said, and will be paid out to the university over 12 years.

Critics have been quick to comment on the partnership.

Paul Swangard, managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon's business school, was quoted by The Huffington Post saying: ‘It appears to be a charitable gift that is trying to be a marketing vehicle, and it just doesn't make a lot of sense.

‘To link themselves with an athletic department when their business is locking people up, it just doesn't connect to me really well.’

Critics of the private prison industry argue that the company is trying to win favour with public officials who hand out contracts.

Bob Libal, from Grassroots Leadership, a
criminal justice advocacy group, said GEO Group relied on public 
dollars for all its profits.

He said: ‘When you look at other things that GEO gives to, it's generally in communities where they either have contracts or are seeking contracts, and certainly Florida is a state where GEO has tremendous interest.’

GEO Group manages correctional, detention and community re-entry facilities on behalf of federal, state and local government agencies and employs more than 18,000 staff.

The Boca Raton, Florida-based company’s revenue has almost tripled in the last ten years as their share of inmate populations increased. They also have contracts to detain hundreds of thousands of immigrants caught by the federal government.

GEO Group’s chief executive, George Zoley, attended Florida Atlantic University, completing bachelors and masters degrees and had also been on the board of trustees.

Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the company said the donation was ‘consistent with the GEO Group Foundation's commitment to fund educational causes and scholarships’.
