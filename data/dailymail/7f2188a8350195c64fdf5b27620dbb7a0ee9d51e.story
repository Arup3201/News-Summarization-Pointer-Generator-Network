Today Mars is a cold and barren desert world, with no apparent sign of life.

But four billion years ago, scientists believe the red planet was a very different place - one that the believe looked a lot like Earth.

A stunning video by Nasa’s Goddard Conceptual Image Lab reveals what Mars may have looked like if its atmosphere allowed for water.

This is an artist's concept of an ancient, habitable Mars capable of supporting liquid water on its surface

The animation is based on existing data collected by Nasa which suggests Mars was once full of huge lakes and waterways.

‘There are characteristic dendritic structured channels that, like on Earth, are consistent with surface erosion by water flows,’ said Dr Joseph Grebowsky of the Goddard Space Flight Center.

The interiors of some impact craters, for instance, have patterns that suggest crater lakes, with many showing connecting channels consistent with water flows into the crater.

‘Small impact craters have been removed with time and larger craters show signs of erosion by water before 3.7 billion years ago,’ added Dr Grebowsky.

The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like

The video was created ahead of Nasa's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission which will investigate dramatic climate change on Mars.

The MAVEN mission is due to launch on Monday November 18 and will arrive at Mars in September 2014.

It will take critical measurements of the Martian upper atmosphere to help scientists understand climate change over the red planet's history.

Specifically, it will investigate how the loss of Mars' atmosphere to space determined the history of water on the surface.

‘Minerals are present on the surface that can only be produced in the presence of liquid water, for example, in hematite and clays.’

Estimates of the amount of water needed to explain these features suggest as much as a planet-wide layer one-half a kilometre (1,640 feet) deep of liquid.

If liquid surface water existed in the past, then Mars' atmosphere had to have a different climate that was warmer.

In the video, rapidly moving clouds are used to suggest the passage of time, and the shift from a warm and wet to a cold and dry climate is shown as the video progresses.

The lakes dry up and freeze over, while the atmosphere changes from Earth-like blue skies to the pink and tan colours seen on Mars today.

It's unknown if the habitable climate lasted long enough for life to emerge on Mars.

‘The only direct evidence for life early in the history of a planet's evolution is that on Earth,’ said Dr Grebowsky.

Nasa said the video is one of the most complex animations ever produced by its Conceptual Image Lab, located at Goddard.

Liquid water cannot exist pervasively on the Martian surface today due to the low atmospheric pressure and surface temperature

‘We used a wide Cinemascope aspect ratio to better showcase the landscape. All this stuff wreaks havoc on the computer system in terms of trying to figure out how to render it,’ said Michael Lentz of Universities Space Research Association, lead animator on the project.

The video ends with an illustration of the MAVEN mission in orbit around present-day Mars.

MAVEN, scheduled to launch on Monday, will investigate how Mars lost its atmosphere and will arrive at Mars in September 2014.
