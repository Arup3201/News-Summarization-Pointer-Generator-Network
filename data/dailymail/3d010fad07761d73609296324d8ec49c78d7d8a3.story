From raunchy pop videos to violent film trailers, there are plenty of reasons why parents may not want to let their children browse YouTube alone.

But a new child-friendly version of the video site is set to launch, which would mean safer browsing.

The app is expected to collate a host of age-appropriate videos from the likes of DreamWorks, National Geographic and YouTubers as well as offering parental controls.

It will become available in the US from the Google Play store  on February 23 - for Android devices only - but a UK launch date has yet to be confirmed.

Shimrit Ben-Yair, the project's group product manager, told USA Today that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year-on-year, but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels. 

‘Parents were constantly asking us, can you make YouTube a better place for our kids,’ she said.

In answer, the company has come up with an app that is simple to use and eliminates features such as viewer comments from the design. 

The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons (pictured): a TV set for popular TV shows such as Yo Gabba Gabba, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos

The categories are called: Shows, Music, Learning and Explore.

‘The images are big as are the tap targets for small fingers, and since most younger children can't type they can search with voice,’ Ms Ben-Yair said. 

MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. A stock image of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street is shown

If children try and search for a raunchy video, for example, the app simply blocks the request and a box that reads ‘Try something else’ pops up.

They will be able to search for topics they are curious about though, such as spaceships and find how-to-make a volcano and maths tutorials, for example. 

Research show that children are just three clicks away from adult content on YouTube

The app will also give parents more power over their children’s viewing habits.

It will give them features to control the time children spend on the app so that it shuts down after a number of minutes or hours. It can be re-started again once a password is entered.

There will also be an option to mute videos - a feature tested by families and NGOs.

'The news that YouTube plans to launch a kid-friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents,' said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab.

'Our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform. 

'Examining YouTube’s "suggested" videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children’s television programmes such as Peppa Pig, Rastamouse and Dora the Explorer, our researchers have found that, on average, users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience.' 

The child-focused app will in part compete with Netflix’s Kids service and Vine’s child-friendly app showing age-appropriate video clips.

The move would appear to be part of Google's strategy to appeal to younger users. YouTube is owned by the search giant.

Google recently acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic, and has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome and Search, as well as YouTube. 

Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to develop a new version of the View-Master, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery.

The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’.

To release the phone’s virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel’s app is needed.

The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play.

The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive.

Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’.

By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,' the company says.

The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10).

Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year.
