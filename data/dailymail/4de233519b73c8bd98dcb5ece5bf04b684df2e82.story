Actor Harrison Ford is said to be 'doing well' after his publicist 
confirmed he broke his left leg while filming the latest Star Wars movie

The injury sustained by actor Harrison Ford on set of the latest Star Wars movie was a broken left leg, it emerged today.

The 71-year-old is said to be 'doing well' after undergoing surgery for the injury, which took place after he was crushed by the Star Wars spacecraft Millennium Falcon.

The actor, who was filming Star Wars: Episode VII at the time, was originally thought to have damaged his ankle during the mishap at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire earlier this month.

But a spokesman for the star has now confirmed the injury was a broken leg.

Although she did not give any further details of the accident, she said the actor was due to start rehabilitation soon and was looking forward to returning to work.

Ford, who is returning to his role as Han Solo in the latest film, was working in the UK on the series when the accident unfolded.

The actor, also known for his appearances in Indiana Jones, had to be airlifted to the trauma unit at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after a hydraulic door fell on him.

His publicist said today: 'Harrison 
Ford's left leg was broken in an accident.

'His surgery was successful 
and he will begin rehab shortly. He's doing well and looks forward to 
returning to work.'

Police said the crush involved a garage door, but it is believed the accident involved the door
 of the Millennium Falcon.

Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident occurred.

There were also fears the actor may 
also have suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis but this has not been confirmed. 

After the incident, his son Ben said that film crews might need to rearrange scenes to only show the actor from the waist up, due to the injury.

His wife Calista Flockhart, best known 
for her starring role in sitcom Ally McBeal, flew
from the US to be at her husband’s bedside.

Disney, which owns Lucasfilm the company behind Star Wars, said after the incident that shooting would continue as planned while the star recovered.

After the incident, a source told The Mirror: 'The initial 
day or two after the accident it was hard to move things around but now 
we have had more time we can juggle things, bring some scenes forward 
and push others back.

'There are lots of other actors in the movie so it is not a disaster. We are confident the film can stay on schedule.'

The actor, who also played Indiana Jones, was crushed on the set when a hydraulic door - believed to be from the spacecraft the Millennium Falcon - fell down and hit him

The £200million movie, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, has been earmarked for release in December next year, after filming began in Abu Dhabi in mid-May.

Carrie
 Fisher, who played Princess Leia Organa, and Mark Hamill - Luke 
Skywalker - are also reviving their characters after more than 30 years.

The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi.
