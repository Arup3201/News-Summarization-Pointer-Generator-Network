A California man was arrested for allegedly murdering his estranged wife and 5-year-old daughter over the weekend after stabbing his girlfriend. 

Joanna Barrientos, 36, and her stepdaughter Mia Lopez, 5, were discovered shot to death Saturday night in the town of Hemet.

Johnny Lopez, 36, Joanna's estranged husband, was arrested Saturday in connection to the double homicide and attempted murder of another woman.

Crime scene: The bodies of the woman and child were discovered in their Hemet home

According to a relative, the slain victims were not blood relatives, but Miss Barrientos cared for Mia and treated her as her own daughter, KTLA reported.

Sheriff's deputies got a call at around 9.13pm Saturday from Barrientos' mother, Annie Copado, who said that two dead bodies were inside a home in the 26000 block of Girard Street in Hemet.

An hour earlier, deputies responded to a home in the 40000 block of Sunset Lane, about a mile away from the second crime scene, where they discovered a woman suffering from stab wounds and lacerations to her neck. She was taken to a hospital in critical condition. 

Johnny Lopez was arrested a short time later on Sunset Lane after being spotted standing on the street covered in blood.

The 36-year-old allegedly put up a fight but was taken into custody after a brief struggle.

At around 9.16pm, deputies got the call about shots fired inside a home on Girard Street and discovered the bodies of Barrientos and little Mia.

The girl's granduncle said that he was told by deputies that the woman and little girl were likely asleep when they were shot dead.

John Bustos told the station that the deadly incident may be related to drugs. The man added that Mia's death may have been prevented if only child services acted on his earlier report asking the agency to remove the girl from her parents' home.

Johnny Lopez has been charged with murder with malice, multiple homicides and attempted murder. He is being held without bail pending his arrangement, which is scheduled for Thursday, MyFox LA reported.

Deputies said both incidents appear to be related. The surviving victim has not been named, but detectives believe that she and Lopez may have been romantically involved.
