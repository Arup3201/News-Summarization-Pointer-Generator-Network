NFL legend Dan Bailey of the Dallas Cowboys was thrilled to watch players of his boyhood team Aston Villa during a pre-season training camp in the summer.

Bailey is renowned as the most accurate kicker in NFL history, having converted 91.07 per cent of his kicks - or an incredible 102 of 112. The 24-year-old is also a passionate Villa fan who could not wait to meet his heroes when they visited Texas for pre-season.

After seeing Paul Lambert's side being put through their paces, he told the Aston Villa website: 'I grew up following soccer and following specific players. A lot of those players played for Aston Villa so I just grew fond of the team and it all took hold from there.

'I have continued supporting them ever since.

'I was a big Gareth Barry fan. He was a lot of fun to watch. I loved the way he played and his style on the pitch.

'I like Gabby Agbonlahor now. He's great to watch.

'Soccer was my sport growing up. I was a defender - I wasn't skilled enough to play any higher.

'I love the sport - everything about it. It's just a great game. When I was a bit older, I made the transition to American Football. But I still love watching soccer.

Bailey has revealed that his first Aston Villa hero was Gareth Barry (R)

'I like watching Brad Guzan. You can see his passion, drive and industry on the pitch. I am delighted he's our keeper. He's brilliant.

'I watched Ron Vlaar in the World Cup. He's been a big strong defender - he's a strong leader on the pitch. He's an outstanding player for us.

'And it's great to have Roy Keane on board too. He's an established name in the sport. That veteran leadership will be huge. I am sure the young guys will buy into his mentality and be a sponge to what he - and the manager - says.'
