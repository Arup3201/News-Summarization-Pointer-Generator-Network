Determined: Jack Lawrence, 10, who suffers from cerebral palsy only learned to walk two years ago

A ten-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who learned to walk just two years ago took part in a triathlon to raise hundreds of pounds for a girl with the same condition.

Aspiring paralympian Jack Lawrence is so delighted with his progress since undergoing a groundbreaking operation in 2009 that he wants to spread the word and help others walk like he does.

The selfless schoolboy ran half-a-mile, cycled half-a-mile and did 25 lengths in his local swimming pool in Filey, North Yorks., to raise 832 pounds to help India Robertson, 11, reach her fundraising goal for the procedure in America.

His delighted mother, Debbie, 48, said: 'It was so wonderful to see Jack do all these events, he looked marvellous running down the street, it is nothing short of a miracle.

'He loved doing the event, he felt like an Olympic athlete. He now wants to compete in the Olympics when he’s older.

'He is so pleased with his progress that when he sees anybody else with the condition he tells them about what has happened to him so they will be able to walk too.

'He was determined to help someone else and he’s really happy he’s helped India so she can hopefully walk like him too.'

Proud father Chris, 38, said: 'There was no struggling at all throughout the triathlon. He took a short break during the swim but he took it all in his stride.

'On his jog, which he finished as the first stage, he said he wished he could have gone further.

'The cycling part he thought because it was downhill it was too easy and he wanted a bit more of a challenge.

'He is full of energy. Apart from a slightly quirky walk he is just the same as anybody else.'

It’s
astounding to think that just two years ago Jack couldn’t walk without 
the aid of his walker or his wheelchair, and he would get around his 
home on his hands and knees.

Spirited: The brave ten-year-old completes a triathlon, next to his father Chris, to raise money for India Robertson, 11, who also suffers from the same condition and hopes to have the same procedure as Jack

Jack was born with cerebral palsy.

Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a number neurological conditions that affect a child's movement and coordination.

Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to 
the brain, which normally occurs before, during or soon after birth.

It is estimated that 1 in every 400 children in the UK is affected by cerebral palsy.

Approximately 1,800 babies are diagnosed with the condition each year.

It does not develop as the sufferer gets older - but it can put a great deal of strain on the body, which can cause problems in later life.

Altohugh Jack underwent a groundbreaking operation which means he can now walk, there there is no cure for cerebral palsy.

A range of treatments can help relieve symptoms and increase a child's sense of independence and self-esteem.

These include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and medication to relieve muscle stiffness and spasms.

Jack was born with cerebral palsy - 
an umbrella term used to describe damage to the brain that occurs around
birth and affects the ability to move.

Around 1,800 children are 
diagnosed in the UK each year.

Jack’s
life took an amazing turn when he underwent a selective dorsal 
rhizotomy (SDR) at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri, America.

The
procedure involves severing the nerves in the spine that send messages 
to paralyse the leg muscles.

With the tensed muscles free to resume 
normal movement, the patient is then able to walk.

Sports-mad
Jack has now even had a go at water skiing and has recently started 
playing table tennis - and is hoping to be selected to play for 
Yorkshire and possibly get to the next Paralympics.

Debbie,
who was able to realise her own dream and open a B&B with husband 
Chris and brother Casey, 11, when Jack could walk, said: 'It was 
heartbreaking when Jack could not get out there and do the things he 
wanted because he is sports-mad.

Fundraising drive: The selfless schoolboy ran half-a-mile, cycled half-a-mile and did 25 lengths in his local swimming pool in Filey, North Yorkshire to raise £832

'He would get so frustrated when he 
couldn’t play with the other kids, he would have to play football on his
knees in the goals but now he’s out there in the field.

'He
has just learnt how to ride his bike without the harness on so he can 
get on and off it when he chooses, it is just fantastic.'

Jack said: 'I feel just like everybody else does now.'

Now he has raised money for India he now has his sights set on another little boy, a three-year-old who visits his granmother nearby.

Happy top help: Jack raised £832 for a fund to allow India, right, to have the same groundbreaking operation as he did

India’s mum, Jenny, added: 'It’s just absolutely fantastic, really touching that Jack was thinking of someone else and he is hopeful that it will raise awareness as well.'

Enough money has now been raised to send India to America and she is due to leave soon for her operation.

Debbie said: 'Now the world is Jack’s oyster and he’s loving every minute of it, he can now be who he wants to be. Aside from sport he would love to be a chef, or a spy.

'I do believe Jack will do it because it’s his determination that has seen him come this far and he just wants to keep on going.'
