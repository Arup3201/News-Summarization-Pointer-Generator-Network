An acid attack victim who suffered 95 per cent burns to her face has paid for her 27th round of reconstructive surgery after winning the jackpot on India's biggest quiz show.

Sonali Mukherjee, 28, appeared on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in December last year to raise money for her ongoing treatment and to highlight the plight of acid attack victims in her country.

She received no state funding after being severely disfigured when a spurned suitor and his friends broke into her room when she was just 17 and doused her body with chemicals.

Sonali and her father Chandi Das Mukherjee have tried to stay strong since the attack 11 years ago

Before her win, Sonali's family had run out of money to pay for further treatment after selling their ancestral land and her mother's jewellery.

Sonali told CNN: 'My father spent every single penny. He sold our land, gold, everything to pay for treatment, hoping for justice.

'In the end we lost everything while the criminals are out there.'

She has used jackpot money of Rs 25 lakhs - equivalent to almost £30,000 - to continue her recovery.

As well as paying for much needed treatment, Sonali said she hoped her appearance on the show, called Kaun Banega Crorepati, will raise awareness of the suffering of acid attack victims.

She told CNN: 'I participated for two reasons. I needed
 the money but I wanted the world to know what an acid attack victim 
goes through in this country.'

Since the attack she has received no money from the state for her treatment and earlier this year she wrote to the Indian 
Government threatening to kill herself if she did not receive state aid.

Sonali won Rs 25 lakhs when she played Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in December last year 

She took part in a one off show called Second Chance, which featured contestants who have shown courage

Sonali said the acid, normally used to 
clean rusty tools, felt as if she had been 'thrown into a fire' and said
 she was in unbearable pain for the first four months.

She was a promising student in her hometown of Dhanbad, in the eastern Indian Jharkhand region, at the time of the attack, which saw her doused in a chemical called Tezaab.

Her attackers are currently out on bail.

Sonali, who now lives in New Delhi, was left partially blind and deaf as a result of her injuries. 

Doctors treating Sonali said the burns were so bad that she had no ears, no eyelids and no scalp.

Sanjeev Bagai, doctor at CEO BLK Hospital, said: 'The challenge was to give her something like a normal face - somewhere close to what a normal human being will look like.'

Sonali received no state funding for her ongoing care and threatened to kill herself last year

As well as the harrowing physical scars, the acid attack has left deep emotional scars on her family as well.

Sonali's mother struggled to cope with the incident and her grandfather had a heart attack.

Her father Chandi Das Mukherjee told CNN: 'Being the head of the family, I couldn't afford to break down. My father died of shock and my wife broke down into depression.'

Despite her horrific injuries, Sonali has continually campaigned for tougher laws for acid attackers.

This year, the Indian government signed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, which brings in tougher punishment for those who commit violence against women.

Acid attack is now defined as a separate penal code offence and perpetrators are recommended to receive a sentence of between ten years and life imprisonment.

However, the stronger laws are unlikely to benefit Sonali in her legal case.
