The parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones  said today they were happy the 'house from hell' where she was killed is being demolished because it means  her 'spirit can be free'.

Heartbroken Coral and Paul Jones spoke out as work started to tear down the rural home of her paedophile killer Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales.

The Welsh Government bought the white-washed cottage after Bridger was convicted of her murder and ordered it to be torn down.

Today it is covered in scaffolding as experts remove the asbestos roof, before it is demolished in the coming weeks. 

Coral and Paul Jones have previously said they wanted the building replaced with blossom trees and a memorial bench.

House from hell: The cottage rented by Mark Bridger, where he murdered April Jones, is covered in scaffolding as builders remove asbestos in the roof before knocking it down

Grim job: Builders will take the roof off piece by piece before demolishing the main building

At peace: April's parents Coral and Paul, right, say that their daughter's spirit can be free now Bridger's home is being pulled down

Bridger, who was jailed for life but has refused to admit to the crime, snatched April as she played in the  street near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales.

Remorseless: Bridger has never admitted murder and will remain behind bars for the rest of his life

Large pools of April's blood were found under the carpet in front of the living room fire where small fragments of her bones were recovered by police.

April's blood was also found in the bathroom and hallway of the cottage despite a desperate bid by Bridger to clean up his rented home using detergents and bleach.

It is believed that he dumped most of her remains in a fast flowing river, and her body was never found. 

In a short statement released by her parents Coral and Paul today they said: 'The house from hell will no longer stand. April's spirit can be free.'

April's disappearance sparked the largest police search in British history, and her killer Mark Bridger tried to cover his tracks by helping with the search before his arrest.

Police raided his home and found evidence linked to the murder and a cache of child porn on his computer, including Facebook pictures of April and other local girls.

Family friend Michael Williams, said the demolition of the house would help 'heal a huge wound' felt by the whole town.

Scaffolding went up around the property on Saturday and workmen are removing asbestos found in the roof prior to the building being demolished - a process likely to take about two weeks.

Mr Williams said: 'It's a huge relief for Coral, Paul and the rest of April Jones' family, and also for the people of Ceinws who have to walk past that house - perhaps every day of the week - and do nothing but remember the horrible memories.

'It's a dark cloud that will be lifted from the minds of all the people of Machynlleth.'

The Welsh Government paid the owner of the cottage £149,000 for the property, the same sum he had paid for it in 2008, after pleas from April's family for it to be demolished.

Bridger was given a whole life sentence last year. He was convicted of abducting April, murdering her and perverting the course of justice by disposing of her body.

Mark Bridger snatched April Jones and took her to his home where he murdered her - but when police found out he then came up with a series of bizarre and far-fetched excuses. 

April Jones's murderer was a serial offender with convictions relating to guns, thefts and road rage attacks, but bizarrely he tried to claim his violent past, dating back 28 years. 

Bridger wanted his criminal record laid bare during his murder trial so the jury would get to know that he had never been in the dock for sexual offences or for having indecent images of children.

Taken in: Bridger minutes after his arrest as he was taken in for questioning - the murder then began to spout a series of bizarre lies about what had happened to April

This was despite the father of six having an obsession with child pornography, uncovered after police raided his home following April Jones’s disappearance in October 2012.

Having first tried to hide his guilt by helping search for April, police pieced together that he was the prime suspect after his car Land Rover was seen near where she was taken.

He then told police that he accidentally ran her over and meant to take her to hospital before ‘blacking out’ because of a combination of drink and panic. A forensic inspection of his car quickly proved this was a pack of lies.

The police raided Bridger's home and found he had tried to cover his tracks by trying to clean his house from top to bottom.

He had washed his clothes, carpets and upholstery while local people were out searching for April, before placing air fresheners in the rooms and cranking up the heating to dry the rooms quicker. 

Officers who searched the property said they were overwhelmed by the strong stench of bleach. 

Shocking: April's blood and bone fragments were found in the lounge of the house but her killer falsely claimed she had been hit by a car

April's blood had also been found in the bathroom - despite Bridger's attempts to clean his house from top to bottom

Cold blooded: Bridger made a number of attempts to hide the murder, but a full forensic examination of his cottage revealed what he had done

But despite this police found blood stains and fragments of April's bones - although her remains were believed to have been thrown in the nearby river.

The blood stains had a 'one in a billion' match to April's DNA profile were found near the wood burning stove, on the carpet and on the sofa.

April’s blood was found in his living room, hallway, the bathroom door, washing machine door and the shower curtain, the court heard.

Once police confronted Bridger about the child skull bones in his fireplace he said that  they were from a chicken supper he cooked for his children.

Blood under the carpet at his home was because he placed April in front of  the fire to keep her warm, he said, as part of his lies about hitting her with a car.

His then told detectives the child pornography on his computer was because he wanted to track the physical development of his own children.
