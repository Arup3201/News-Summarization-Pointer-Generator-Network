Glenn Hoddle has turned down an approach from managerless Crystal Palace to hold talks about replacing Tony Pulis.

Hoddle, now coach at QPR, was sounded out on Wednesday about taking over at Selhurst Park.

But the former England manager, offered a route back into the game by Redknapp, does not want to walk out on QPR so soon after starting the role.

No go: QPR coach Glenn Hoddle has turned down an approach from Crystal Palace to replace Tony Pulis

Palace hoped to speak with Hoddle this week, but he has decided not to discuss terms with the south London club.

Palace have turned their back on former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay and will take their search for a new manager elsewhere.
