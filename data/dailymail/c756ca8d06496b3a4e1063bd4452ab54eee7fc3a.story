A flight attendant has landed in the Guinness Book of Records book after spending an incredible 63 years in the sky.

Ron Akana, 83, the longest-serving air steward in aviation history, worked his final flight from Denver to Kauai, last weekend ending his amazing career in the state where it began.

Hawaii, however, wasn't his final stop. His destination now is retirement in Boulder, Colo., where he has been living since 2002 to be closer to his grandchildren.

Mr Akana has spent his first few days of retirement writing thank-you notes to well-wishers.

'I wasn't expecting this much attention,' he said.

He joined the airline while a student at the University of Hawaii in 1949, when friends spotted a newspaper ad - one of 400 applying for only eight spots.

'We didn't even know what a flight steward was,' he recalled. 'But it meant getting to the mainland, which was a huge deal in those days.

'It seemed pretty exciting and it proved to be more than that.'

Jovial Ron became one of United's first male flight attendants. "

'We just liked working with girls,' he said.

When Mr Akana started, all of the seats 
were similar to those of today's first class cabin. Many of the planes 
had bars, smoke filled the cabin air, and passengers moved about freely,
often using a circular staircase to go between floors.

He had to put his career on hold for two years when he was drafted in 1951 during the Korean War.

Akana said his most memorable moments included meeting the cast of the 1953 movie 'From Here to Eternity,'

The 1953 Oscar-winning film, which 
starred Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, was set in 
Hawaii so he rubbed elbows with the stars on one of their flights.

'I made her bed in the stateroom. That was exciting,' he told The New York Times about the trip.

'Burt Lancaster had 12 or 13 martinis, then came and bartended with me as if he hadn’t had one,' he recalls.

Over the years, he's seen it all. Passengers would dress up, not down. Think suits, not flip-flops. Smoking was no big deal, not a federal offense.

Over time, though, things changed. The meal service became better. No more smoke. In-flight movies, which he said started to be shown seven or eight years after he began his career. And, of course, tight security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Home away from home: Mr Akana met his wife when she worked as a flight attendant, and his daughter has now been working as a flight attendant for 22 years

Guinness World Records came calling a few months ago and later sent him a plaque recognizing him as the longest-serving flight attendant. He's been told he'll appear in the record book in October.

To get a sense of how long he's been in the air, consider that if his 200 million miles counted toward United's frequent flyer program, he could treat the entire town of Big Rock, Ill., population 1,138, to a first class trip from Chicago to Honolulu and back - then once a month for the next 12 years, he'd still have enough miles to travel with his wife, Elizabeth, anywhere they want in the continental U.S.

Their daughter Jean followed in her 
parents footsteps as well, and has now worked 22-years as a flight 
attendant for United, which recently merged and is now known as 
United-Continental.

Akana decided to retire after he was offered a buyout. But he admits being tempted to hang on for the arrival of the next super jet, the Boeing 787. 'I shall have to watch from the sidelines,' he said.

While he's now retired, Akana is not done flying. From now on, his wife will be joining him.

'I got terrific travel privileges,' he said, adding: 'There's a lot to be seen.'
