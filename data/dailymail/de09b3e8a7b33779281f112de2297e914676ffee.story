Ben O'Neill, 14, had a pioneering and live-saving heart operation last month after a major vessel collapsed

A teenage boy with a rare condition which caused his heart to be twice the normal size has undergone a pioneering world first operation to save his life.

Ben O'Neill, 14, went under the knife for ground-breaking keyhole surgery to insert a stent into his heart at the Glenfield Hospital in Glenfield, Leicestershire.

Doctors decided to perform the procedure on the youngster after a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs completely collapsed. 

A team of 20 experts faced a race against time as they battled to save Ben during the five-hour procedure which had never been tried before.

Medics inserted a stent into his heart and then used a new valve - taken from the jugular of a Australian cow - to repair his pulmonary artery.

Ben has suffered from the rare genetic condition Tetralogy of Fallot for his entire life.

The condition resulted in the teen suffering four different heart defects at the same time. 

But thanks to the pioneering operation, the cricket-mad teenager is now back at the crease and enjoying his new lease of life.

He said: ‘I felt that even if it wasn't successful then at least it would benefit other people and I'm glad they can now receive the same treatment.

‘It's great to be back on the cricket pitch again.

‘Before the operation I had to take regular breaks before stopping playing altogether.’

His father, Sean, 48, a small business owner, added: ‘The operation was a world's first, it was amazing what they could do.

‘He was under the knife for five hours, during which they put in a stent and a new valve.

‘The stent
 went into his pulmonary artery. Normally if this kind of treatment is 
required it is because the artery is blocked due to lack of exercise or 
bad diet.

‘They
 would then just be opening the artery, but the reason that Ben's was 
blocked was that his coronary artery was pushing against it and forcing 
it into his breast plate.

Ben (pictured after surgery in 2005) was born with a complex heart defect and has had a series of open heart operations. The most recent one was required because a major vessel between his heart and lungs collapsed

Ben needed surgery because a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs completely collapsed.

This was causing him to become very breathless and was putting his life at risk.

During the keyhole operation, surgeons inserted a stent into his pulmonary artery to keep it open.

They then inserted a new valve which came from an Australian cow.

They did not want to carry out another open heart operation for fear of the damage it would cause the muscle, so they had no choices but to perform keyhole surgery.

They were so worried that he would suffer a heart attack on the operating table that they had a life support machine ready for him if he needed it.

‘So it is not just a blockage inside the artery, it is something forcing it closed from the outside.

‘His heart was having to work harder to pump the blood and so was growing much bigger than it should have done.

‘The doctors went in via a keyhole and inserted the stent into his pulmonary artery.

‘They then put a new valve inside the stent, which had created a fully open artery.

‘That valve came from the jugular of an Australian cow. They modified it to make it work with humans and then they inserted it into Ben.

‘Turns out you cannot use a British or European cow because of BSE so they are flown from Japan or Australia.

‘It has completely transformed Ben's life, in fact it has saved his life.

‘It's so great now, he was told to stop exercising in winter and now just a few weeks after the op he is playing cricket, back at archery practice and today is playing tennis at school.

Since the operation, Ben (pictured in hospital in 2005) says he is able to play sport again without becoming breathless and having to stop

Ben had his first operation at just 10 months old and then had further surgery at six and 11 (pictured)

‘Now he should be able to live a full and normal life, although it's all new ground now.’

Tetralogy of fallot affects just five in 10,000 people and the abnormalities it brings can be fatal.

Ben first underwent surgery for the condition when he was just 10 months old, before further surgeries at six and 11.

Each of those surgeries was only partly successful, leaving Ben facing another gruelling spell under the knife.

He began to complain of breathlessness last autumn while exercising at school near his home in East Leake, Nottinghamshire.

After a series of MRI scans medics concluded they had no choice but to operate and Ben went back under the knife on March 11.

His mother, Rebecca, 47, a teacher, added: ‘We have had a lot of anxiety about it.

‘You lie awake at night thinking “he has already had three operations, can he really have another?”

‘But we are so happy and grateful for the work the doctors at Glenfield have done.

Ben's most recent operation was the first of its kind to be carried out. He is pictured in hospital in 2005

‘When they said he was completely better we almost didn't believe them - I don't think it has sunk in yet.’

Cardiologist
 Dr Frances Bu'Lock said the keyhole procedure had enabled her team to 
treat Ben's problem without damaging the heart muscle.

It was the first time the procedure had been attempted without opening up the chest.

Dr Bu'Lock said: ‘Ben is the first person in the world to have this type of procedure performed this way.

‘It was a team effort and we're very pleased to hear how much of an improvement Ben has noticed since.

‘It became clear the blockage was due to muscle thickening which hadn't been cut away as it contained one of the arteries supplying the heart muscle with oxygen.

‘Doing a fourth open heart operation to deliberately cut away the muscle containing the blood vessel had a very high risk of death or heart muscle damage.’

Tetralogy of Fallot is a group of four structural abnormalities within the heart that occur together.

These are:

Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease.

Babies with the condition will need surgery to correct their heart abnormalities.

Before surgery, they often appear blue and are prone to fainting.

About 98 per cent of children with the condition survive and go on to have a good quality of life.
