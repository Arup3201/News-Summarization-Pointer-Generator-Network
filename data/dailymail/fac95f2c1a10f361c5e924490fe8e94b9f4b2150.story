Ford has unveiled a new hybrid car with a roof covered in solar panels.

The C-Max Solar Energi claims to be the first sun-powered hybrid vehicle that does not depend on electricity for fuel.

The vehicle, which has one-and-a-half square metres of photovoltaic cells on its roof, will go on show at the Consumer Electronics Show 2014 (CES) held in Las Vegas this week.

The C-Max Solar Energi, concept image pictured, is set to be the first sun-powered hybrid vehicle that does not depend on the electric grid for fuel. Ford claims the car can cut greenhouse gas emissions per car by four tonnes a year

The panels, built by SunPower in California, have a single metal layer on the back of the photovoltaic cells.

This layer is fitted inside curved glass on the top of the car, which the company claims enables them to use 50 per cent more energy over the same surface area than standard solar panels.

However, these panels alone do not generate enough energy to power a car for a day.

Instead, Ford plans on amplifying the amount of solar energy harvested using a solar concentrator lens called a Fresnel lens, similar to that of a magnifying glass.

Fresnel lenses were originally made of glass and were used in lighthouses to extend the reach of light over the water. They are now made from lightweight acrylic.

The car is designed to be parked under a canopy equipped with a Fresnel lens to boost the impact of the sunlight by a factor of eight. Ford said the car could move back and forward independently when 'parked' to track the sun and keep the maximum amount of solar energy concentrated on its panels

Scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology came up with the idea that the car could be parked under a canopy fitted with Fresnel lens, in an open-ended garage for example.

Ford added the car could then move independently back and forward underneath this canopy to track the sun and keep the maximum amount of solar energy concentrated on its panels.

This would then  boost the impact of the sunlight 'by a factor of eight' to charge the vehicle more effectively.

By using a combination of the efficient solar panels and the lens canopy, the company believes the car can gain the equivalent of a four-hour plug-in charge (about 8 kilowatts) in one day.

The panels on the car's roof, pictured, are housed in curved glass on the top of the car. The manufacturer of the cells, SunPower, claims this shape enables the panels to collect 50 per cent more energy over the same surface area than standard solar panels

This translates as enough energy for most people to make local journeys without using the car’s gas system or plugging the car into an electricity grid.

The car additionally comes with a conventional hybrid system for when the sun isn’t shining.

Using a combination of its hybrid systems and solar panels, the C-Max Solar Energi has a range of 621 miles, including 21 miles of driving using electricity only.

The company claims the C-MAX Solar Energi
 Concept could reduce the annual greenhouse gas emissions a typical 
owner would produce by four tonnes.

Ford data suggests the sun could power up to 75 per cent of all trips made by an average driver in a solar hybrid vehicle, which could be especially important in places where the electric grid is 'underdeveloped, unreliable or expensive to use.'

Ford plans on testing out its new concept car after CES is over to see if it is feasible to put it into production.
