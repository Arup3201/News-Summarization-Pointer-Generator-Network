Ian Wright may have scored 113 Premier League goals in a glittering playing career, but the force was not with him when he decided to turn up for Star Wars auditions.

The former Arsenal striker revealed on his 5 live radio show that he was rejected from being a stormtrooper in the new Star Wars film because he was too short.

Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is highly anticipated by fans, and Wright wanted to get involved in the action himself when open auditions were held.

'I wanted to be a stormtrooper in Star Wars but you have to be 5ft 11in & I was too short,' said Wright, who is 5ft 9.

'Two of my friends got to do it.'

Wright will be hoping his former club Arsenal will have better luck than he did when they take on Southampton at The Emirates stadium on Wednesday in the Premier League.
