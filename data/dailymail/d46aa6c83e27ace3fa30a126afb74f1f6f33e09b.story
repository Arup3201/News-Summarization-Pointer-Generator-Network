Liverpool were dealt a blow after new signing Emre Can limped off after just 20 minutes during a pre-season friendly against Preston.

The Germany Under 21 international, who joined for £9.8million earlier this month, had been struggling with a minor ankle problem prior to the game, and it is believed he has aggravated this against the League One side.

The former Bayer Leverkusen midfielder had earlier missed the Reds' midweek trip to Brondby, but was passed fit to face Simon Grayson's side.

But after getting a knock early on he was replaced by highly-rated youngster Jordan Ibe.

Elsewhere, boyhood Reds fan Rickie Lambert made his first start for the club since his £4m move from Southampton.

Long-term absentee Jose Enrique was also among the substitutes at Deepdale, as the Reds looked to bounce back from their midweek defeat in Denmark.
