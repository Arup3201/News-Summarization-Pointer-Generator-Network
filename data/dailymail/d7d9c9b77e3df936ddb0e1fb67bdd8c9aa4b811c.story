A Geelong housing commission tenant is under investigation from the department of housing after she was found to be sub-letting her public housing property and pocketing the cash.

The Salvation Army granted Tammy Kenyon and her partner Jamie Hutchinson a commission home in the southern suburb of Belmont last year.

But Ms Kenyon has been caught after advertising the property online and keeping the money in a rental scam, reports A Current Affair.

The mother-of-three was exposed after advertising the property and rental prices on her Facebook page.

"Three bedrooms, large yard, carpet all the way through, kitchen, bathroom and laundry have lino, $280 a week, $600 bond," one of the posts reads.

In another, she claimed to sympathise with the would-be tenant about knowing what it’s like to be without a home.

Ms Kenyon requested the money to be transferred into her account, then pocketed the cash without ever planning to move out of the property.

But she was caught out after advertising the property for varying prices on Facebook 

Single mother Leonie O'Connor fell victim to the scam after getting repeated burglaries at their family home.

She paid a $400 bond, but became suspicious when she noticed the home was still being promoted on Facebook.

"She spent my bond money and I don't think I am ever going to get it back," Ms O'Connor said.

When confronted, Ms Kenyon has admitted she knew what she was doing was illegal, and that she used the money to pay her own bills

Another victim, pregnant mother-of-four Lorna, lost $850 in bond money from the scam.

When confronted, Ms Kenyon has admitted she knew what she was doing was illegal, and that she used the money to pay her own bills.

She claims to be in the process of paying back the people she's scammed, but the department of housing claim none of her victims have yet to have been paid back.
