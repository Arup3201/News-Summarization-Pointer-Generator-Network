Six out of ten people are worried about spiralling energy bills, far eclipsing the number concerned about climate change.

Despite ministers’ efforts to convince the public of the need for costly ‘green’ energy projects, just one person in 20 said climate change was Britain’s biggest challenge.

When asked to rate the relative importance of ten issues, climate change was picked by just 5 per cent of those asked in the Government survey.

The quarterly survey by the Department for Energy and Climate reveals growing anxiety about energy bills in the last year

Gas and electricity bills are more than 7 per cent higher than a year ago, but the government claimed that the public was most concerned about climate change

Unemployment was top of the list, at 
37 per cent, followed by the NHS, inflation and rising prices, law and 
order, education, tax, energy supply, climate change and national 
security. Only 17 per cent put climate change in their top three 
challenges, according to interviews with 2,500 people by the Department 
for Energy and Climate Change.

Rising energy bills, however, were 
very much on people’s minds, with 23 per cent saying they were ‘very 
concerned’ and another 37 per cent ‘fairly concerned’, higher than in 
the previous four surveys.

Some 43 per cent believed energy 
prices had risen more than shopping or transport costs, despite a rise 
in numbers of those who had switched suppliers to get a better deal.

The survey revealed only five per cent of people thought climate change was the top challenge facing the UK

More people were aware of ‘collective
switching’ – in which people club together to obtain a better deal – 
but two-thirds were ‘not interested’ in it.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it 'comes as no surprise' that people are worried about bills

Despite the figures, Energy Secretary
Ed Davey said: ‘The findings show energy and  climate change issues are
at the forefront of people’s minds.

‘It comes as no surprise that energy 
bills are a concern, but the increase in collective switching awareness,
as more and more people club together to increase their energy buying 
power, is encouraging.’

He said it also showed ‘clear public 
support for the Government to continue in its efforts of developing for 
low-carbon, home-grown forms of energy’.

The number of people who said they supported renewable energy rose to 82 per cent, 3 per cent up on a year ago.

Solar panels were one of the most popular and onshore wind power one of the least.

Last year, all of the Big Six energy 
firms introduced inflation-busting rises of up to 11 per cent, raising 
the average dual fuel bill to over £1,300.

The independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicts they will rise by another 7 per cent this year – another £100.

Climate change policies currently 
make up £112, or nine per cent, of the average household energy bill, 
and this will rise to £286 by 2020 according to the Government’s 
figures.

That will mean that 25p in every £1 spent on electricity will go on wind, solar, nuclear or home insulation schemes.
