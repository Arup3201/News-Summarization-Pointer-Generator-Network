A 13-year-old schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his short back and sides haircut grows out, which could take months.

Kyle Gibbs was separated from his classmates and told he would not be allowed to socialise with his friends after teachers ruled that his traditional style flouted the school's strict hair length rules.

The Year 9 pupil at Churchdown Academy, Gloucestershire, must now work on his own in a classroom from 8am until 5pm until his hair grows to an 'acceptable length'.

His father Colin, from lmbridge, Gloucester, said the school's decision was 'madness' and insisted the young footballer's haircut is 'neat and tidy and totally unremarkable'.

'The school called and I asked what he had done wrong and when they said it was his haircut I thought they were joking,' he said.

'I was shocked. I cut his hair and he has a neat short back and sides. It is grade 0.5 at the back and longer on top, in an old fashioned style like every boy used to get at the barbers. I couldn't believe it.

'The school said he would have to stay in isolation, on his own in a classroom from 8am until 5pm until his hair grows back. It is not his hair that is doing his reading and writing for him. This is madness.

'It is not like he has a Mohican or strips shaved into the sides. I could understand that might be a distraction to other pupils in class, but his haircut is neat and tidy and totally unremarkable.'

Kyle has been told school policy states his hair can't be any shorter than a grade two.

This is not the first time the 13-year-old has landed himself in trouble for dodging school uniform regulations.

He had been taking part in trials with Birmingham City FC and wore black trainers to school as he had a heel injury.

Despite the fact that he told teachers wearing smart shoes was painful, he was told that trainers were not appropriate for school.

There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide.

But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy.

The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy.

A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion.

'I have been into the school to speak with the head teacher,' said Mr Gibbs.

'He said it was school policy and he was backed by the governors. Kyle doesn't feel comfortable in school and I'm not going to let the teachers dictate my son's hairstyle.'

Head teacher Christopher Belli took over at the school in September and said in a welcome address that there would be a 'relentless focus on high standards'. 

The uniform policy states hair should be: 'Natural colour and words or emblems should not be shaved in hair'. 

Churchdown School Academy has declined to comment. 

Schools across the country have been enforcing strict uniform policies in the past few years in an attempt to raise standards. 

Last week it emerged that Liam Pegg, 12, was also separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies  - despite having the cut for a year.

He will be forced to study on his own at Nailsea School, North Somerset, until his 'extreme' haircut grows out. 

And Anthony Mousiou, 12, is also being taught in isolation at Samuel Ryder Academy, Hertfordshire, because his hair cut was too short - by just 4.5 millimetres.
