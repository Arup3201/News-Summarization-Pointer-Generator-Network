Tax row: The French government is demanding £160million from internet retailer Amazon in unpaid tax

The internet giant Amazon has received a £159million demand from France for unpaid taxes.

The figure includes fines and interest in relation to 'the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'.

European nations including Britain are clamping down on US firms that channel their vast profits through low-tax countries.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Amazon, Starbucks and Google should all be punished for not paying their 'fair share' of tax.

She has called for consumers to boycott the firms in protest against what she describes as 'immoral' tax avoidance here.

But Amazon said it might go to court to fight the French tax claim, which relates to four years from 2006.

A report by the company says: 'We disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it.'

Amazon's public policy chief for Europe, Andrew Cecil, appeared before the public accounts committee on Monday, and the French demand was referred to during the hearing.

The company keeps its tax bill down in European countries by channelling money through Luxembourg, which offers generous concessions to businesses.

Google, which channels its profits through Ireland, is also being audited by the French tax authorities.

Amazon has also run into problems with the tax authorities in other countries, with American and Japanese officials both forcing the company to ‘reach an agreement’ on the allocation of the company’s earnings between 2006 and 2012.

The company has also revealed that it is under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for the two years from 2005.

The company is also facing demands for taxes dating back to 2003 from countries including China, Germany, and Luxembourg, as well as Britain.

Google is currently being audited by the French, although the company has denied a report that it the Paris tax authorities want 1 billion in back taxes.

Yesterday, Andrew Cecil the online retailer's 
public policy director, told the commons committee that the business's 
turnover in 2011 was £7.3billion yet it paid 
taxes of just £6.4million.

Amazon employs nearly 70,000 people world-wide.

Last year, it turned over more than $48bn revenue.

The company was founded in 1994. But since then has grown into the biggest online retailed in the world.

It is estimated to be worth $102.51bn

Some 65million customers log on to its U.S. website each month.

It paid no UK tax in 2010 on revenues of 
£3.3billion.

MPs were furious that he refused to reveal how much the company made from its British arm.

'It's quite insulting to our 
intelligence that you claim you don't know what sales you make in the 
UK,' said Liberal Democrat MP Ian Swales, a member of the influential 
Commons committee.

Mr Cecil claimed that Luxembourg, 
which employs around 500 people, was the real 'engine' of the business, 
rather than the UK, where it employs 15,000.

Its profits are booked in Luxembourg,
 with the UK figuring only as a 'service arm'.

MPs said his answers were
 'evasive' and 'annoying' and Margaret Hodge said the committee would 
call 'a serious person' for further questioning.

She said Mr Cecil's ignorance was 'outrageous' and that he had 'been put up' to it by the company.

The parliamentary committee, which is
 also examining the tax affairs of Google and Starbucks,  said it would 
be summoning a more senior Amazon executive to answer their questions.

It is not just in Europe that Amazon has run into problems with the tax authorities.

In its statement to the SEC, it revealed that US and Japanese tax authorities had reached an agreement on the allocation of the company's earnings between those two countries for 2006-12.

The cost to Amazon of this settlement was 'not significant', it said.

The company however also revealed that it remains under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for 2005 and 2006.

It also admitted that there was a chance of the company being hit by demands for taxes dating back to 2003 in 'various states and other foreign jurisdictions' including China, Germany, Luxembourg, and Britain.
