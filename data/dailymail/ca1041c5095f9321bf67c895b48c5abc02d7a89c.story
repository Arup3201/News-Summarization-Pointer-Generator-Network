When a stray named Sam turned up at the council pound, many would have had him down as a lost cause.

The German Shepherd's limbs had been ravaged by arthritis and he looked certain to be put down - until a kindhearted charity worker insisted vets could rebuild him.

They had the technology and, thanks to the charity's generosity, they had the £12,000 funds. Now, his joints painstakingly reconstructed, all Sam needs is a home.

Nicknamed the 'Robo Hobo', Sam was last year diagnosed with multiple orthopaedic problems, including arthritis in both elbow joints.

Alison Mills, who runs the Southern Counties German Shepherd Rescue, in Linwood, Hampshire, decided to step in and pay for his operations - shelling out £5,500 for each elbow to be replaced.

Now the re-built pooch is looking for a new family after recovering from the surgery.

Mrs Mills said: 'A big thank you to everyone who has raised funds for us to make this possible - we really hope that Sam can now go on to live a long and pain-free life.

'Everyone who meets Sam comments on what
a beautiful dog he is, with a calm, tolerant nature, always happy to 
see you and play ball.

'Sam is amazing - despite all the pain he must have been in when he first came to the rescue, he still wanted to play ball.

'He did it by throwing the ball to you, so you could throw it back for him.'

Sam was found as a stray and came to the charity from the council pound having served his statutory seven days.

If the charity had not taken him in he could have been put to sleep.

He underwent two operations to replace his elbows, one in October last year, and another just under four weeks ago in April.

The process has been so costly Mrs Mills claims it is like the 1970s TV series Six Million Dollar Man, starring Lee Majors as the astronaut whose body is rebuilt with state-of-the-art bionic implants after he barely survives a plane crash.

Mrs Mills added: 'We are a relatively new rescue run solely by volunteers, who raise funds and give their valuable time.

'Our belief is that once we have taken a dog in, we are committed to providing all the necessary care and treatment a dog needs, only considering euthanasia on medical grounds once every other opportunity has been exhausted.'
