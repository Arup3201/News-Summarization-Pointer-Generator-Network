Tomorrow night’s House of Versace TV movie, starring Gina Gershon, has been famously met by contention from the Versace brand itself.

Now, the film’s costume designer, Claire Nadon, has described the challenges she faced while outfitting Gershon as Donatella and staging four Versace fashion shows without use of the Versace archives.

According to Nadon, ‘It was quite an adventure because the company didn’t help us at all in any way, even with archives or anything,’ she told MailOnline.

Frank imitation: Actress Gina Gershon plays a remarkably convincing Donatella Versace in the new film

Nadon was responsible for bringing Donatella Versace’s signature platinum hair, tightly-fitted clothes, and heavily glossed pout to the small screen.

The film, airing on the Lifetime network, stars Gershon as a rather convincing looking Donatella battling grief and a well-documented drug addiction in the wake of her brother Gianni’s tragic 1997 murder.

Nadon was required to create an array of accurately Versace-inspired costumes to provide viewers with a proper look at the brand’s evolution. She had to devise an expansive wardrobe for Gershon’s character as well.

From Donatella’s beloved stilettos, tight tops, and second-skin flared trousers, to the label’s many runway missteps and triumphs, Nadon essentially recreated the Versace story from thin air, only using eBay finds and reference photos as help along the way, she says.

‘We had to buy books and look on the Internet and try to find enough documents to base ourselves upon,’ Nadon said of House of Versace's costuming process. ‘I wanted to be as correct and close to the original as possible.’

But while Nadon’s efforts are 
admirable, the film’s wardrobe shows how there is no true replacement 
for atelier seamstresses and creative genius. With the exception of 
Gershon’s wardrobe, House of Versace’s costuming offers a cheaper, 
watered down version of Versace’s glamorous luster--the brand’s true 
defining factor.

A recreation of the colorful vinyl dresses worn by Christy Turlington, Stephanie Seymour, Nadja Auermann, Claudia Schiffer, and Cindy Crawford in Versace's famous 1994 ad campaign fall flat in a scene recounting the shoot's party atmosphere. Its costumes in no way embody the same sexed-up space age brilliance as those created under Gianni’s inimitable watch.

'Gina is thin, but not as thin as Donatella. We had four different corsets for her depending on the clothes she was wearing'

There are also, unfortunately, many 
failed attempts at recreating Versace’s signature gold damask print, as 
Nadon was forced to find a copy due to the brand’s uninvolvement in the
film. (Nadon says ‘they were expecting a bigger budget and a bigger 
star’)

Nadon says that she worked on the film’s costumes for ‘twenty hours a day, seven days a week, for two months.’ She cut most of the costumes’ patterns and fabric herself (‘Of course we didn’t have the staff of the Versace house’, she said), and enlisted the help of four seamstresses to execute the wardrobe’s remaining technical labor.

Gershon underwent 43 costume changes in the film, most of which required her to wear a corset in the vein of Donatella herself.

‘As [Donatella] got older she was even wearing corsets under pants and tops,’ Nadon said. ‘Gina is thin, but not as thin as Donatella. We had four different corsets for her depending on the clothes she was wearing.’

Gershon’s performance, laden with a soft
interpretation of Donatella’s heavy Italian accent, shows the iconic 
designer in the irate throws of cocaine addition, taking 
stealth helpings of the substance from a gilded keychain. Her drug-induced 
angst, a byproduct of her brother Gianni’s murder, tarnishes her 
business and personal relationships, which only recover after a stint in
rehab.

It’s Gershon’s physical appearance that makes her on-screen role so convincing. Donatella’s signature glossy look is well articulated through expert hair, makeup, and styling. Recreating Donatella’s protruding pout was accomplished with a tiny cotton ball placed under Gershon’s lip.

'We didn’t want to show how much Donatella has worked on her face and how distorted she is now'

‘I’m pretty sure that Gina looks a lot better than the actual Donatella,’ Nadon told us. ‘We didn’t want to show how much Donatella has worked on her face and how distorted she is now.  We still wanted to appeal to the crowd, and didn’t want to make her look disgusting or disfigure her.’

On Thursday, the Versace brand issued a statement in anticipation of the film’s release. ‘Versace has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV movie about Mrs Versace,’ reads a statement issued to MailOnline.

The House of Versace film (which begins in 1996 and culminates around 2005) is based on the 2010 book ‘House of Versace: The Untold Story of Genius, Murder, and Survival’ by Deborah Ball. The Versace brand says that ‘since Versace did not authorize the book on which [the film] is based, the movie should only be seen as a work of fiction."

Representatives for the Lifetime network refrained from offering a counter statement when reached by phone on Thursday evening.

House of Versace’s backstory is very much rooted in facts. Versace has even confirmed her cocaine addiction and stint in rehab in a 2005 interview with Vogue magazine.

In that vein, Gershon does portray the public’s well-engrained perception of Versace’s platinum personality. It’s a singular stereotype that was first widely broadcast in the early aughts with Maya Ruldolph’s well-loved Donatella impersonation on Saturday Night Live.

Donatella herself has called Rudolph’s impersonations ‘hilarious’, an interesting counterpoint to her brand’s opinion of House of Versace. But the two portrayals are not so different in their levels of contentious content.

A 2003 SNL skit titled ‘Versace Halloween’ shows Rudolph’s Donatella handing out Ambien and cigarettes to trick-or-treaters. Her performance is weighted with the same cocaine, alcohol, and rage also found in Gershon’s more serious imitation.

But the film falters at the hand of some historical inaccuracies. Most are courtesy of the script’s story-telling omissions.

The film painstakingly details the Versace brand's many financial woes that erupted after Gianni Versace’s death, pointing to Donatella’s continuous strain of unrealized designs and excessive spending habits as the culprits.

In doing so, the film makes it seem like Versace was a completely undesirable commercial entity for nearly a decade’s time.

Donatella is shown presenting her first collection after Gianni’s death, one which received grave reviews. What follows is a mélange of Donatella’s drunken, cocaine-fueled rants and missteps. The audience only sees the negative falls of Donatella’s post-Gianni life, until she returns from rehab and presents the label’s fall 2005 collection, which drew positive criticism.

'Donatella’s many cartoonish media portrayals have not hindered her, or the Versace brand, in their present state'

While the Versace brand did take a design nosedive following Gianni’s death, it was by no means the drawn-out atrocity that the film describes.

A Style.com review written in 2000 calls Donatella’s Versace shows ‘the social event of the season in Milan.’ Her designs, while no longer the catnip of style savants and supermodels, still made noise on the red carpet (J.Lo’s plunging Tropicana moment comes to mind). The brand was not a critical success, but was still very desirable in the public mind.

It's worth noting that Donatella’s many cartoonish media portrayals have not hindered her, or the Versace brand, in their present state. House of Versace ends around 2005, a time at which Versace found a reinvigorated foothold in the fashion industry. The brand has since continued to suffer from financial difficulties, and was even rumored for partial buy-out in 2012, but has flourished in the critical and cachet arenas.

In 2009, Donatella hired then-emerging British visionary Christopher Kane to restart the house’s Versus diffusion line, as well as consult on the main Versace brand (Kane departed last year in order to focus on his own label when it received a major investment from Kering).

Kane, as expected, brought some much-needed added edge to Versace’s sexy, often too-sleek signatures. Following his departure, fellow British upstart J.W. Anderson took on the temporary reigns at Versus, the responsibilities of which will now be handed to a new designer each season (Anthony Vaccarello and singer M.I.A. are rumored for the house’s next choices).

The house’s most recent accolade is a feature in Migos and Drake’s song titled ‘Versace’, which bluntly mention’s the brand’s name approximately 150 times in its lyrics. The track has become a meme amongst millennials, effectively skyrocketing the label’s profile into a new, highly-desirable genre. MailOnline even recently spotted ‘Versace’ repeatedly graffitied onto construction walls in New York’s typically more Ralph Lauren-inclined Upper West Side neighborhood.

As House of Versace points out, it may have taken Donatella a bumpy ride to restore Versace to the glory days of Gianni’s influence. But it seems that now, more than ever, she is certainly on her way.
