A World War Two veteran who faced celebrating his 88th birthday alone was overwhelmed when he received dozens of cards from strangers all over the world.

Gene Moore, 88, had recently moved to a retirement home and was facing the prospect of a sad birthday with very few friends to celebrate with.

His grandson, Jon Moore, 24, appealed to Reddit users to help him make his grandfather's birthday special after his grandmother Nola Moore, 85, said she was concerned that her husband would have a lonely day.

The family were overwhelmed when nearly 40 cards and more than 300 emails from all over the world turned up in time for the octogenarian's birthday last week.

Mr Moore, of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, said: 'Last Christmas we had to move my grandfather into a nursing home because he needs daily medical attention.

'Even though he was just down the street it was hard for us to see him go, but even harder for my grandmother because he was all she had.

'They have been married for 66 years, so you can imagine how close they are. It's been hard for her.'

A couple of weeks before his grandfather's birthday Mr Moore, a software designer, saw a post on his Facebook page from his grandmother.

He said: 'She asked if I would spread the word to see if we could get more friends and family to send him cards to make his birthday extra special.'

Mr Moore posted on the popular link aggregation site Reddit urging people to send birthday cards to his grandfather for his birthday.

Mr Moore said: 'No one in my family knew I was going to post it to Reddit, and no one anticipated the amazing response we got.

'I figured that if even two people sent cards, then my grandparents would be overjoyed.

'I compiled together some photos of my grandparents for the Reddit post, including one from his days in the Navy during World War Two.

'He was a Navy Postman on the USS John A. Bole, so it was almost ironic that the man who carried letters of love for so many people during the war was finally getting letters himself.'

On July 22nd the family were overwhelmed when they found their letterbox stuffed with cards from Canada, Australia, Holland, China, California, Texas, and the UK wishing Gene Moore a happy 88th birthday.

Mr Moore said: 'The cards all contained birthday wishes, local greetings from whatever exotic location they came from and photos and messages from people saying that my grandfather was lucky to have a loving family who cares about him.

'I was shocked - I have seen what strangers on the Internet can do when they rally behind something, but I never expected it to affect me directly.

'It has been so amazing to see such genuine kindness from everyone - we were all surprised and absolutely thrilled.'

Mr Moore said the unexpected well-wishing from around the world meant his grandfather had a very special birthday.

Mr Moore said: 'My grampy was so happy. He is generally not the most emotive person in the world, but he loved seeing the letters.

'His strongest memories to date are those from when he travelled and served with the Navy, and being stationed in Shanghai.

'One of the letters we received was from someone in Shanghai who went to the old postal station building where he was stationed on land, took photos, had them printed, and sent them over with a very sweet letter.'

Mr Moore barely had enough space in his nursing home room to display his impressive hoard of cards

Mr Moore added that his grandmother was thrilled to give her husband a memorable surprise.

He said: 'She loves him dearly and it pains her to see him so lonely. She wants to give the world to him - I was trying to help her do just that.

'I told them the story of how I went about posting the photos online, showed them the comments, and read them the messages.

'She was teary-eyed and speechless that complete strangers would send cards for no reason other than to make an old man's birthday a little more special.'
