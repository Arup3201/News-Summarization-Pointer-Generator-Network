A self-styled lord who led the life of an international playboy while masterminding a huge fraud must repay nearly £14million or face another decade behind bars

Edward - ‘Fast Eddie’ - Davenport, 48, hosted lavish parties at his £10million mansion and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry.

But the socialite was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes.

Edward Davenport, shown left in a police photo and right at his £10million central London mansion, enjoyed a champagne lifestyle, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous

The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments.

Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport.

The fraudster, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years behind bars in 2011, was not at Southwark Crown Court today to hear the Judge Peter Testar’s ruling.

Davenport, who was released from prison on licence in May due to acute kidney problems will also have to find £1,943,620 in compensation in addition to the £12million.

Judge Testar said today: ‘Through his dishonesty Edward Davenport has caused harm to many people and it would be an insensitive judge who was not conscious of those whom he had defrauded.’

The judge lamented the fact Davenport’s victims may never see their cash returned, because of his ‘attrition’ tactics.

‘It
 is a very great pity that the legislation does not permit civil 
claimants to gain access to funds that have been confiscated.

‘In
 the end, and although it might seem harsh to the losers from Edward 
Davenport’s crime, I have come to the conclusion to exercise my 
discretion so as to make a confiscation order in the full amount of 
£12,000,000.

‘There is a risk that civil claims will not come to fruition, or that true to his normal way of conducting matters Edward Davenport will wage a campaign of attrition and wear the claimants down so that they give up or somehow or another he is allowed to hang on to money that he has obtained by fraud.

‘In the end, I have decided that the risk of Edward Davenport retaining some of the fruits of his crime is one that my public duty dictates I should not take.’

Davenport will now have to sell his central London mansion, at Portland Place, which he bought for a pittance from the Sierra Leone government.

The five-storey, 110-room house was also used for film shoots, a fashion show and a masquerade ball, while his swimming pool was reportedly filled with Cognac so revellers could row through it.

Scenes from the Oscar winning film The King's Speech were also filmed there, and Kate Moss was filmed walking down its staircase wearing nothing but stiletto heels and underwear for an Agent Provocateur advert.

He enticed his victims with a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco.

Davenport claimed to be a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’

His web page boasts: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’

Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan and music mogul Simon Cowell.

Davenport, of Portland Place, central London, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud.

His bill could rise to £15,855,273, if he is ordered to meet both prosecution and defence costs.
