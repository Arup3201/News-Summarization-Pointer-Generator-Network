Victims of Cyril Smith are threatening to sue the Liberal Democrats for covering up his decades of sickening sexual abuse.

As MPs and child abuse charities call for a full inquiry into Smith’s paedophile activities over more than 40 years, six victims said that they would issue writs for damages if it could be shown the LibDems had known about Smith’s abuse but failed to try to stop him.

Former Children’s Minister Tim Loughton called for Smith to be posthumously stripped of his knighthood following devastating revelations about his depravity in a book by Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, being serialised by the Daily Mail.

And Greater Manchester Police announced they are carrying out a new investigation into abuse at a residential school in Rochdale where Smith carried out regular attacks on boys.

Further explosive revelations from the book in today’s Mail include:

Lawyers for Smith’s victims are looking to pursue Rochdale Council as well as the Liberal Democrats.

Fiend: Cyril Smith's crimes were covered up by his high-ranking friends

Portrait of a child abuser: Like his friend Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith used his charitable works as a cover for his fiendish activities. Biographer Simon Danczuk believes that the Liberal Party is still in denial about the monster who was in their midst

Richard Scorer, a solicitor at Slater and Gordon representing six men who claim they were molested by the MP as boys, is investigating how much senior Liberals knew.

He said: ‘We are examining who knew what about the MP, and that includes the Liberal Democrat Party and Rochdale Council, and we are actively considering all possibilities in relation to those potential defendants.’

Mr Danczuk, who interviewed many of Smith’s victims for his book, said it was ‘only right and proper’ that they should seek compensation from ‘those who neglected to listen to them’.

The Labour MP added: ‘I think consideration should be given to some sort of inquiry in terms of what Smith was up to. There is still a lot of denial around – not least in the Liberal Party.

‘Witnesses could be called to bring evidence, while others could face questions in terms of what they knew and what action they did – or did not – take about this prolific abuser.’

Tim Loughton, a Conservative former children’s minister, called for a wide-ranging inquiry into historic child abuse, looking at Smith’s activities alongside those of Jimmy Savile and paedophiles in the NHS, children’s homes, churches and schools.

He said the Lib Dems seemed to have ‘turned a blind eye’ to the allegations, and called for Smith to be stripped of his knighthood.

‘Very clearly this chap did some nasty things and we need to get to the bottom of how exactly this went on and how it was that the Liberals made him a knight.

At present it is not possible to strip
 public figures of an honour after death because they cease to hold the 
gong when they die.

The Liberal Democrats need to put their hand up and say what happened then,’ he said.

Smith was knighted on the recommendation of former Liberal leader David Steel in 1998, when rumours about the Rochdale politician's sexual activities were already rife in Westminster.

Party allies: Cyril Smith was recommended for a knighthood by David Steel, former Liberal Party leader

David Steel became Liberal leader in 1976 after Jeremy Thorpe was forced to resign after he was accused of conspiracy to murder his former gay lover.

Lord Steel, at 38, was one of the youngest party leaders in British political history and in March 1977 he formed the LibLab pact to keep James Callaghan's minority Labour administration in power.

Andrew Bridgen, the Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, added: ‘A public inquiry would get to the truth. It’s transparency and the truth which conquers all.

‘I’m not convinced that organisations that have allowed this to happen on their watch have changed.’

Man of the people... if only the people knew: Sir Cyril Smith was a popular figure nationally, one of the most recognisable political figures in Britain in the 1970s, often appearing on light entertainment shows like Blankety Blank and Heroes of Comedy discussing his friend Bernard Manning

Martin Digan, a whistleblower who exposed abuse by Smith and others at Knowl View residential school in Rochdale, said the local council had also carried out a massive cover-up.

‘They were culpable. They failed to take action and instead hid the evidence in a safe at the council,’ he said.

Peter Saunders, the chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said there needed to be a wide-ranging Royal Commission looking into cover-ups of historic child abuse.

He said: ‘There absolutely should be an inquiry [into Smith’s abuse]. The reason I don’t think there will be one is because there are too many others who have been involved with the outrages and are still alive and kicking, and would not want to be associated.’

Peter Watt, the NSPCC’s director of national services, added: ‘No matter what the situation, any complaints about child abuse should be investigated and people in positions of  power should not be immune from this.’

One of Smith’s victims called for the Liberal Democrats to carry out a full inquiry.

Kevin Griffiths, 65, said: ‘Nick Clegg needs to tackle this because a failure to act 40 years ago led to the abuse of dozens and dozens of boys by one of their leading MPs.’

A Lib-Dem spokesman said yesterday: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined.

‘His actions were not known to or condoned by anyone in the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats. It would be inappropriate to comment further on any potential legal action.’

And John Pugh, the Lib Dem MP for Southport, told the Observer: ‘I am as shocked as the next person by these revelations. I can confirm that they were not widely known until recently.’

But there is growing evidence that senior figures in the  party did hear rumours about the crimes.

As far back as April 1979, a press officer working for then Liberal leader David Steel, now Lord Steel of Aikwood, gave a statement about Smith’s alleged abuse to a local newspaper, the Rochdale Alternative Press.

After learning that the title intended to print details of a police investigation into complaints against Smith, Lord Steel’s spokesman said at the time: ‘It’s not a very friendly gesture, publishing that. All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms.’

One former Liberal MP, Michael Meadowcroft, who was in Parliament from 1983 to 1987, has said that ‘whispers’ that Smith ‘liked boys’ did the rounds of Westminster over the ensuing years.

Lord Steel, who put Smith forward for his knighthood, has yet to comment on the Daily Mail’s recent revelations and it remains unclear what steps he took to confirm that the obese politician was telling the truth.

Special Branch officers would watch as Smith cruised known pick-up spots looking for young rent boys during Liberal Party conferences in Blackpool, it was claimed yesterday.

Police were also allegedly aware that he secretly took vulnerable schoolboys on holiday with him and his mother to Lytham St Annes in Lancashire so he could abuse them.

Sir Cyril Smith’s family said yesterday that they were ‘saddened and concerned’ by the claims about him.

In a statement to the BBC, Smith’s 82-year-old brother Norman and other relatives said they were upset that the allegations were being made when he is no longer alive to defend himself.
