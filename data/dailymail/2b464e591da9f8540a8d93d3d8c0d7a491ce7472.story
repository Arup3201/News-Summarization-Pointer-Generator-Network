Louis van Gaal has blamed Manchester United's long tour of the USA as partly to blame for the hamstring injury that is expected to keep Luke Shaw out of action for a month.

The 19-year-old is not available for United's opening Premier League game against Swansea and Van Gaal gave six reasons he felt the injury happened.

The Dutchman said: 'We've analysed the injury. It is difficult to lay a finger on it but of course there are a lot of reasons.

'The first was the World Cup. The second is jet-lag from the USA. The third is that he has not trained enough physically to play matches.

'The fourth reason is that he didn't come fit. The fifth reason is that after travelling back we had a match on Tuesday.

'The sixth reason is the training - the amount of sessions. I've only done half of what I would have done with other clubs.

However, according to former Wales coach Raymond Verheijen Van Gaal is to blame for Shaw's hamstring injury, suggesting the former Southampton left-back had participated in too many training sessions ahead of the new season.

Van Gaal however remains relaxed before the big kick-off: 'There are nine players injured but I am not nervous. We have beaten everyone so far but tomorrow is the one that counts.'

The United boss also confirmed Robin van Persie won't be considered as he arrived at pre-season late after an extended break following the World Cup.
