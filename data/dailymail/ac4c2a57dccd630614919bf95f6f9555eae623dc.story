Finnish mentalist Jose Ahonen is back playing tricks on dogs in a hilarious new video that presents the hungry hounds with a magical hot dog.

'Today we are going to find out how dogs react to levitating wiener,' he introduces the video before materializing the hovering sausage.

Some are immediately disturbed and back away, others bark uncomprehendingly, and a few don't care whether Ahonen is defying the laws of gravity as long as they can get a bite of the salty treat.

Poor Noah is spooked when presented with the hovering wiener

His first canine volunteer, Noah, gets up and scurries away as soon as he's confronted with the magic trick.

Meanwhile the small, black Ilona gets on her hind legs and follows the wiener as if hypnotized by the delicious meat.

Luka's only fear of the magical treat is that she won't get a bite

Perhaps the most practical is Tico, who simply barks loudly then bites the wiener out of the air and runs off with it.

No matter what the dogs reaction, Ahonen made sure every one got to eat a wiener once the shoot was complete.

Ahonen seems to have struck on a winning viral video formula combining his magical feats with cute dogs.
