With the richest fight in the history of boxing being confirmed, the world of sport has reacted to the eagerly anticipated clash between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao with obvious excitement.

Mayweather set the countdown to the £160m ($250m) mega bout in motion after announcing on Friday that the pair would finally meet at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas on May 2.

The fight between the unbeaten American and the highly rated Filipino has been five years in the making with feuds, ranging from shares of the purse to arguments over drug testing, dominating every stage of the stuttering discussions.

But, with both of them now ready to rumble, sports personalities across the world ranging from Amir Khan to Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher have taken to social media to vent their enthusiastic views.

Mayweather is understood to have commanded a 60-40 split of the purse to guarantee him £96m of the £160m total - as well as an autumn rematch clause.

The 37-year-old is understood to have been the dominant figure throughout negotiations – right up to getting his wish to announce the fight, which he did via Shots.com - a social media site in which he has a stake in.

Mayweather's name will be first for the billing of the fight ('Mayweather-Pacquiao'), according to SI, while he will be introduced and walk to the ring second.
