A Good Samaritan who shoveled his neighborhood's sidewalks was left stunned after an irate neighbor dumped the snow back on the walkway before grabbing him and telling him to keep away.

Will Immke, 23, had cleared the snow from a disabled neighbor's driveway and sidewalk in Eastlake, Ohio on Sunday so that she could move around safely.

But the good deed didn't impress 69-year-old Larry Myers, who lives next door to the woman. He grabbed his snowblower and started blowing snow back towards Immke as he cleared it up.

When Immke told the man he was clearing the sidewalk for the neighbor and so that children could reach their school buses, Myers told him the kids could walk in the street, WKYC reported.

Spat: Larry Myers, left, can be seen blowing snow onto a sidewalk as Will Immke, right, clears it for a disabled neighbor in Eastlake, Ohio on Sunday. Myers later grabbed Immke and now faces an assault charge

'And I said "Are you stupid?"' Immke told the channel. 'And that's when he grabbed me by my throat and my face and shoved me back.'

Myers didn't deny grabbing the man but said he only held on to the front of his shirt.

'I grabbed him... and I said "Leave my sidewalk alone",' he said. 'I specifically told him I don't need you to shovel my section of the sidewalk,' he added to WOIO.

After Immke went back into his home across the street, Myers covered the sidewalk with the snow that had just been removed. It means that Myers has been left with a massive frozen wall of snow on his section of the sidewalk.

'When everybody else around here cleans their sidewalks, I will clean mine,' he said defiantly.

Myers complained to Eastlake Police, but they say they are now investigating him for a misdemeanor charge of assault.

No denial: Myers, pictured, admitted that he had grabbed Immke and told him to stay away from his sidewalk

'Not very neighborly,' they wrote on their Facebook page as they announced the pending charge.

They also shared a photograph taken by a neighbor across the street showing Immke clearing the snow while Myers' snowblower forced snow back on to the path.

'As the complainant continued the snow removal, the suspect returned with a snow blower intentionally blowing snow on the victim shouting for him to leave the area,' the police wrote. 

The neighbors told WOIO that it's not their first run in.

'This was over snow,' Immke said. 'In the fall it's over the leaves. It's just constant.'
