When you're releasing the follow-up to a game that's been downloaded a BILLION times, you have to hope it doesn't flop.

Angry Birds maker Rovio has revealed the followup to the
hugely successful game - a new puzzle title about a 'curious boy' who loves to build things.

Company CEO Mikael Hed told a Finnish TV show the new
game will be called Amazing Alex and will be released in two months’ time.

Angry Birds has spawned everything from toys to a TV
show, and has even been used onboard the International Space Station by NASA to
demonstrate the effects of gravity.

The game is based on intellectual property Rovio
purchased from the Casey's Contraptions game.

A video of Casey's Contraptions on YouTube shows a game
where players drive small cars and move pigs and balls through a series of
puzzles.

Hed says Rovio’s latest game has an educational element
and centres on main character Alex, a curious young boy who loves to build
things.

'The quality pressure is high. We want to maintain
the high standard Angry Birds fans have come to enjoy,' Hed said.

Angry Birds: This company is preparing itself and getting ready,¿ said Anders Lindeberg, Rovio's head of investor relations

‘This company is preparing itself and getting ready,’ said Anders Lindeberg, Rovio's head of investor relations.   

Rovio reported 2011 sales of $99 million (£61.2 million).

It also reported a 64% profit margin for the year.  

Rovio,
originally founded in 2003, has been valued at up to £5.5 billion just 
over two years since it launched its first hit, Angry Birds for Apple's 
iPhone.

Rovio is also expanding its brand to toys and playgrounds, and is taking the birds to the big screen.

The first full-motion animated movie featuring the characters is in works and the short animations are a YouTube hit.    

Consumer
products, which includes merchandising and licensing, generated around 
30% of revenues last year, with the share higher in the fourth quarter, 
Hed said.    

Rovio
animation head Nick Dorra said: 'Angry Birds 
will, in the future, be less and less about the slingshot.'

He
promised that the series will explore, 'Deeper thoughts, deeper 
feelings of the characters, such as why are they always angry?'

Angry Birds has been downloaded 700 million times - and now the game will become a weekly TV series

Peter Vesterbacka, marketing chief of 
the Finnish start-up behind the world's most downloaded game said that 
Rovio, the makers of Angry Birds, sees itself as an entertainment brand,
not just a games company.

'We
want to make Angry Birds a permanent part of pop culture,' he said, 
comparing the brand to Nintendo's Mario and Sanrio's Hello Kitty. 'We're
just getting started.'

Angry
Birds, in which the player uses a slingshot to catapult birds to 
destroy green pigs hidden in fortresses, has been downloaded more than 
700million times, and is the fastest-growing game on Facebook.

Rovio
raised its profile hugely last year by hitching a game to the hit 
animated movie Rio, made by News Corp's 20th Century Fox, even burying a
clue to the game in the movie studio's Super Bowl ad.

The
valuation of £5.5 billion might seem high for a company that 
essentially only has one product, but company insiders are confident.

'It's
as good a guess as any,' said Vesterbacka, comparing Rovio to Facebook 
games maker Zynga, which went public in December and has a market value 
of £6billion.

Rovio has 
also signed up a top U.S. retailer to put its branded toys, books and 
T-shirts in dedicated areas of thousands of stores nationwide, timed to 
coincide with the launch of its new Angry Birds Space game this week.

The company also plans to open branded retail stores in China soon.

In the game, players have to launch birds with varying powers at green pigs, smashing through wood, glass or stone blocks to gain points

Rovio
has about 300 staff, up from 50 a year ago, and has had to move 
out of central Helsinki to new, bigger headquarters next to mobile phone
maker Nokia.
