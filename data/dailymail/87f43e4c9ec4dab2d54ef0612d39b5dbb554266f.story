War hero Corporal Johnson Beharry, who saved the lives of 30 soldiers in Iraq, has married his girlfriend in a ceremony at a London registry office today.

The decorated soldier and his glamorous bride Mallissa Venice Noel were photographed leaving Old Marylebone Town Hall after today's service, which took place under a veil of military-style secrecy.

Guests at the wedding were ordered to hand over their phones before the ceremony after Cpl Beharry and his fiancee signed a magazine deal.

Friends and family who attended the wedding had to give in their phones to make sure photographs of the happy couple weren't leaked. The couple have signed a photo deal with Hello! magazine for an undisclosed sum.

Dressed in full military uniform, the 33-year-old soldier arrived for the ceremony just before 11am via a back entrance.

The waiting media didn't catch a glimpse of 27-year-old bride-to-be Mallissa's arrival as she was also ushered into the venue through a side entrance.

Further efforts were made to keep Mallissa's dress under wraps when she left after the hour-long service.

But she was glimpsed wearing a long, 
black velvet cape to cover her flowing lace wedding dress as she got 
into a white Rolls Royce at the back of the building.

Cpl Beharry left in a separate car minutes later as the wedding party made their way to a further ceremony at the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy, also in London, by coach.

The bridesmaids were dressed in long, red strapless gowns and the flower girls wore powder pink dresses with white fur shrugs.

Johnson Beharry was born one of eight children on the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1979.

He moved to Britain in 1999, joining the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2001, serving first in Kosovo then Northern Ireland.

On 1 May 2004, Beharry was driving an Armoured Vehicle in Iraq when it came under fire from rocket propelled grenades. Beharry was forced to open his hatch to steer his vehicle, exposing his face and head to attack.

He gallantly steered the crippled Warrior through the ambush, leading five other Warriors to safety.

He then rescued wounded comrades from the vehicle, all the time exposed to enemy fire.

He received the Victoria Cross, the highest honour in the British and Commonwealth armed forces, for twice saving members of his unit from ambushes on 1 May and again on 11 June 2004 at Al-Amarah, Iraq.

It was in his second rescue that he sustained serious head injuries.

Beharry became the first recipient in 2005 of the Victoria Cross since the Falklands War of 1982.

He is one of only six living recipients of the VC.

Wedding guests were seen arriving 
from 10.30am, including Cpl Beharry's brother Jade, who was dressed in a
 black suit, red tie and grey waistcoat.

Ben Duncan, a former Celebrity Big Brother contestant and close friend of Beharry's, also attended.

The couple got married in the Blue Room at the registry office which holds up to 30 guests.

It is believed the newlyweds were due to be serenaded later by the Army Wives Choir during a bash in the Senate House at University College London.

Mallissa, who is from Cpl Beharry's native Grenada, first appeared by his side at a charity bash in London last November.

It is thought the pair have been dating for two years.

Speaking after the wedding, Michael Noel, Mallissa's brother, said: 'It's a happy day.

'They have been together for two years and I wish them a long and happy life together,' said Mr Noel.

The bride's brother said guests had travelled from Grenada and Miami to be with the couple on their big day.

'We're just relieved it isn't snowing or raining,' he said.

'It's a lovely day for a wedding.'

The union is Cpl Beharry's second marriage.

He split from first wife Lynthia in 2005, blaming the trauma of his war experiences.

Westminster Register Office, also 
known as Old Marylebone Town Hall, has hosted an array of high-profile 
weddings over the years, from Paul and Linda McCartney in the 1960s, to 
Paul's fellow Beatle Ringo Starr's wedding in the 1980s.

Oasis
 star Liam Gallagher wed Patsy Kensit at the venue before exchanging 
vows with Nicole Appleton 11 years later at the same venue.

Cpl Beharry was the first VC winner in over 30 years, and the first living one since 1969.

Hero: Cpl Beharry was presented with the Victoria Cross in March 2005

The medal was awarded for two acts of bravery when he was a private with 1st Battalion, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2004.

The first came in May when he led an ambushed patrol to safety, despite coming under heavy fire in a Warrior armoured vehicle.

One month later, Cpl Beharry saved eight more soldiers despite suffering serious face and brain injuries when a grenade exploded inches from his head.
