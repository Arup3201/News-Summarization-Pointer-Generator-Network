relationship between the teacher and student occurred on school 
property. Authorities would not say how long Jacques taught at the 
school.

religious education, cooperated in the investigation into their former 
employee.

Prosecutor for the case, County Assistant District Attorney Matthew Quigg said: 'I wanted to see her punished appropriately for what she did, as well as send a message to the community in general that you can't engage in sexual relationships with minors.

'Specifically, she engaged in sexual relations with someone who was a former student of hers.'

Randy
Thaxton, chief administrator, told philly.com that he was 'deeply 
saddened' by the arrest but the school had no further comment.Â
