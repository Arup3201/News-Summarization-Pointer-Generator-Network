As a guitarist and singer for folk band Canach, Caitlin McNeill has long dreamed of achieving worldwide fame.

But it was a picture of a dress rather than her musical talent has made her a global star - and all because no one could agree on its real colour.

Commented on by everyone from celebrities to politician, the unexpected popularity of the photo has left Caitlin reeling.

Caitlin, a guitarist and singer for folk band Canach, started the worldwide debate over the colour of a dress

The 21-year-old, from the island of Colonsay in the Hebrides, has spoken of her shock over the worldwide furore her post caused.

'I thought my followers on Tumblr would maybe have a good reaction, but I never would have considered that Taylor Swift and Mindy Kaling would be tweeting about it,' she told Business Insider.

She added in a comment on her band's Facebook page which read: 'It seems like we've caused quite the stir online! This is madness!' 

Thanks to the intense media interest in the two-tone dress, Caitlin has found herself inundated with requests to share her story and has appeared on radio shows in Canada and the U.S. as well as in her native UK.

She said of the response to her post: 'It was insane, I still feel like I'm in dream, it's crazy seeing all the Tweets. I kept tabs on it for a couple of hours but then I completely lost track.'

She added in the interview for Canadian radio station KISS 92.5: 'I think I'd like to say I'm sorry to half the world, and I'd like to say I'm glad you have had a good time arguing with your families to the rest of the world!'

Caitlin - who hails from the remote island of Colonsay in the Hebrides - said she can't believe how much of a reaction her Tumblr post has caused around the globe

Caitlin first posted the image of the £50 figure-hugging frock by Roman Originals on her Tumblr account after her friend's mother wore the dress to a wedding.

She wrote the caption: 'Guys please help me - is this dress white and gold, or blue and black? Me and my friends can't agree and we are freaking the f*** out.' 

The dress was worn by Cecelia Bleasdale when her daughter Grace Johnston tied the knot.

Prior to the big day, Ceceila sent a picture of the frock to her daughter and she and her fiance, Keir Johnston, disagreed over the colour. They shared it with their friends of Facebook to see what they thought. 

But it was when Caitlin, who agreed to play at the wedding with her bandmates, posted the picture on Tumblr that the issue went global and started trending on Twitter.

The aspiring musician told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat how the events unfolded: 'Two of my very good friends were getting married and they asked me to put together a band to come and play at the wedding. 

'This was a wedding on the tiny island that we come from on the west coast of Scotland called Colonsay and about 100 people were there.

'A week beforehand the bride had been sent by her mother a picture of the dress she was going to wear and when the bride showed her fiance, they disagreed about what colour it was.

'She was like, "It's white and gold" and he said, "It's blue and black".'

While thousands of people have declared online what colour they think it is, it has since been confirmed that the dress was indeed black and blue - and the gold and white shades seen by some are an optical illusion.

Caitlin said she's yet to hear an explanation of why the dress is viewed in different shades and she's bemused that so many of the world's experts have puzzled over the image.

Kim Kardashian West joined the debate saying she thought it was white and gold on Twitter

Ellen DeGeneres also commented on the debate causing Caitlin to say the reaction was 'madness'

Achieving worldwide fame is something Caitlin hoped she would always do for her music after she taught herself the guitar and attended the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music at Plockton High School, in Ross-Shire, Scotland.

She's already well-known on the island Colonsay, although that is because it has just 125 inhabitants and as a result, everyone knows everyone else.

It is the most remote fully-fledged community in Great Britain and has two churches, two doctors, two restaurants, one shop, one hotel, a village hall and one school.

The island is 10 miles long and two miles wide and is accessed by ferry from Oban, Argyll.

She joined forces with Alana MacInnes and Robbie Greig to form the band Canach, who play traditional Scottish folk music, and had been asked to perform at the now infamous wedding.

On the band's Facebook page, their biography states that 'a stream of local concerts and gigs is steadily building the reputation and fan base of this dynamic trio'. 

But they would never had thought it would have been a dress rather than one of their songs that truly put them on the map.
