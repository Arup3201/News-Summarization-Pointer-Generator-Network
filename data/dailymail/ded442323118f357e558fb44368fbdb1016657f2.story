Does your spoilt furry friend turn their nose at the ordinary dog food, refuse to chow down on the 'not so fancy' stuff or just picks at their food and gives you THAT look when you dish it up?

Well now there's a solution, or at least for a couple nights of the week, Delivery Hero 'Doggy Bags'.

There's no doubt that many Aussie pets are getting the royal treatment these days with a lot of us seeing our furry friends like they're our very own children.

Now we can spoilt them even more.... with the online company stepping out of the box and appealing to the pet lovers of the nation and this month it has launched a food home delivery service for pets, literally the 'Doggy Bag'.

That's for a Dog? The Doggy Bag meals are just like 'people food' and your pet can indulge in takeaway with you

Delicious.... no doubt pets are loving the Delivery Hero 'Doggy Bags'. 8 Sydney restaurants have jumped on board offer pet owners the choice of getting their furry friend takeaway too

That's for me? This dog can't believe his luck..... he probably had the penne

And we're not talking about 'so chumpy you can carve it' from a can type meals or the fishy tastes of 'Whiskas' but actual gourmet 'people food' so that when we order in the takeaway dishes we love, we can also grab something tasty for our pets too. 

Delivery Hero say they wanted to include the WHOLE family so that means 'Buster' the dog and 'Fluffy' the cat can indulge in Saturday night take out, cooked by local restaurants, which can easily be added to any takeaway order.

They guarantee the Doggy Bags will arrive piping hot at the door with the rest of the family dinner. Just another reason for Rover to chase the delivery driver! 

At the moment only eight restaurants within Sydney are taking part in the unique concept and it's pretty easy to do.

All you need to do is go to the Delivery Hero website, pick a Doggy Bag restaurant, order your own meals online, then follow up with something for your best mate too. Simple! 

Online company, Delivery Hero is appealing to the pet lovers of the nation and have launched a food home delivery service for pets, literally the 'doggy bag'

Not just for dogs, Delivery Hero CATer for everyone

All the Doggy Bag meals are prepared specially for pets and are low in seasoning

'The idea came about after an April Fool's joke I suggested to do takeaway food for pets' Delivery Hero marketing executive Guillaume Papillion told Good Food.

'Then we realised it wasn't a joke and it could actually work.' 

And looking through the different assortment of meals for your pets there's no doubt they will get a pleasant surprise when their Doggy Bag meal arrives.

Just like they're from the human main menu, Doggy Bag meals include dishes such as, penne in a meat sauce with chicken, zucchini, carrots and pumpkin for a bargain price of $6 or $8 from Micky's cafe in Paddington.

Maybe your pets like to go super gourmet with a goat marsala with rice and vegetables from Maya Da Dhaba, Surry Hills or how about sharing a late night snack after a few drinks (of water) with a grilled chicken kebab with rice and tomatoes from Turkish Pide and Kebabs, Erskineville.

And it's not just for dogs, they CATer for everyone, with all dishes cooked to Purrfection.

Some of the areas where 'Doggy Bags' are available. 8 Sydney restaurants are currently participating with plans to expand across Sydney and eventually nationally

mmmmmhhh dinner! Restaurants have a range of menu items including penne with chicken, goat marsala, chicken kebab and chicken with tumeric

Fido do you feel like Thai tonight? Why not get a 'Mah Yim' for your pooch with your pad thai

Should be go carbs tonight? Pets can have a grilled chicken breast with mushrooms and pasta at Millennium Pizzeria

At La Illtimo pets can get a large or a small meal, I bet most would go for the large right!!

At anywhere form $5 to $10 bucks a pop, it's just like an extra side to your meal and hey if you're extra hungry, you could probably even pinch some of 'Fidos', that's if he let's you.

But probably what most caring pet owners are thinking is, will this be safe for our beloved 'max' or 'kitty' to chow down on?

Delivery Hero says all the Doggy Bag meals are prepared specially for our furry friends and participating restaurants have been briefed on what they can and can't use.

'They're very simple dishes,' Mr Papillion told Good Food,' Onions for instance, are toxic to dogs. And everything is very low in seasoning.'

'The owner of Taste of India in Double Bay was like 'I really want to do chicken with turmeric but I don't know if turmeric's OK for dogs'. So he went across the road and talked with a vet who said it was fine.'

But while there's only eight eateries that are catering for our pets, we can expect to see more, Delivery Hero has plans to expand across Sydney and eventually nationally.

So pet lovers, who like their pal to eat as good as they do, watch this space, you could soon be dining together with your furry friend from a restaurant near you.
