A former Massachusetts drug lab chemist at the center of a scandal that threatens to unravel thousands of criminal cases pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges including perjury and evidence tampering.

Annie Dookhan, 35, also convinced a judge at her arraignment on Thursday to push her 6 p.m. curfew back to 10 p.m. because it was crimping on her social life.

Dookhan's arraignment on 15 charges in Suffolk Superior Court could be the first in a series of arraignments in other counties following a 27-count grand jury indictment Monday.

Busted: Annie Dookhan was indicted Monday, December 17, 2012 on 27 charges, including obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, perjury and pretending to hold a college degree

Doesn't stop here: Many more cases could be affected because authorities have said Dookhan tested more than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab

State prosecutors allege Dookhan 
fabricated test results and tampered with drug evidence while testing 
substances for criminal cases. Judges have released about 200 defendants
from custody in the last few months and put those cases on hold. Many 
more cases could be affected.

Authorities say Dookhan tested more 
than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at
the lab. State police shut down the lab in August.

Dookhan made no comment to the media outside the Boston courtroom 
after she pleaded not guilty to eight counts of evidence tampering, five
counts of witness intimidation, one count of perjury and one count of 
making a false claim of holding a master's degree.

In court, the Franklin woman stood behind her lawyer and blinked 
repeatedly while looking toward the magistrate's bench. 'Not guilty,' 
she replied to his questions about the 15 counts.

Magistrate Judge Gary Wilson agreed to change Dookhan's nightly curfew 
hour from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. after her lawyer said the earlier hour was 
hampering the social life of a defendant who already was on GPS 
monitoring and had no criminal record.

'She's not a flight risk. It's certainly putting a damper on her ability
to have any kind of a social life, interact with the neighbors and 
family and friends,' defense lawyer Nicolas Gordon said.

Dookhan also remained free on $10,000 bail.

'Ripple effects': Dookhan's 'alleged actions have sent ripple effects throughout the criminal justice system' state Attorney General Martha Coakley said

Afterward, Gordon said he hasn't seen all of the government's evidence 'so it's too soon to comment' on aspects of the case.

'I'm told there's thousands of emails out there and I haven't seen them yet,' he said.

Authorities alleged in court records Thursday that Dookhan once emailed a
fake test result to a prosecutor for use in a criminal case, relying on
a sample that had been gone from the lab for about six months.

Authorities have said Dookhan admitted to investigators she sometimes 
would 'dry lab' samples, meaning she would test some samples for drugs 
and assume the others were positive. She also allegedly admitted she 
sometimes added a known narcotic to a sample to turn it positive if it 
tested negative.

In addition, authorities claimed Thursday that Dookhan testified 14 
times that she had a master's degree in chemistry from the University of
Massachusetts-Boston although investigators found she was never 
enrolled in classes at that level.

The only potential motive authorities say they can offer in the case is Dookhan's desire to be seen as a good worker.

'Messed up bad': 'I screwed up big-time,' Dookhan is quoted as saying. 'I messed up bad; it's my fault. I don't want the lab to get in trouble'

Dookhan faced suspension from her lab duties in June 2011. Authorities 
alleged that dozens of drug samples weren't properly checked out of a 
safe and that Dookhan forged a colleague's initials to try to cover her 
misconduct.

She resigned in March during a Department of Public Health internal 
investigation. Amid that probe, state police took over the lab in July 
as part of a state budget directive.

nnie Dookhan, 35, of Franklin, was 
indicted by a grand jury on 17 counts of obstruction of justice, eight 
counts of tampering with evidence, perjury and pretending to hold a 
college degree.

‘We
allege that Annie Dookhan tampered with drug evidence and fabricated 
test results on multiple occasions,’ state Attorney General Martha 
Coakley said. ‘Her alleged actions have sent ripple effects throughout 
the criminal justice system.’
