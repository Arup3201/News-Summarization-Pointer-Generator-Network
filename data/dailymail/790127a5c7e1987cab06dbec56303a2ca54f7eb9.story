A police chief in suburban Atlanta resigned Wednesday before a grand jury decides whether to charge him with a misdemeanor crime for accidentally shooting his sleeping wife after drinking alcohol and taking sleep medication, officials said.

Police Chief William McCollom called 911 early New Year's Day to report accidentally shooting his ex-wife, Margaret, as the couple slept in their bed. 

A prosecutor plans to seek a misdemeanor charge — but not a felony — against McCollom. 

Resignation: Police Chief William McCollom resigned from his position in the Peachtree City Police Wednesday 

The couple divorced in 1999 and later reunited.

'I have had had two families in Peachtree City - my police family and my personal family,' McCollom said in a statement published on the city's website.

'In light of the recent tragedy in my personal family, I need to continue to focus my time and efforts there.' 

Griffin Judicial Circuit District Attorney Scott Ballard has said the shooting left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist.

He said last week that Margaret is being treated for the paralysis at a spinal cord rehabilitation center. 

The chief told investigators he drank alcohol and took medication to help him sleep. McCollom had a loaded handgun under the sheets.

'The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to a side and it went off,' McCollom told a dispatcher, according to a recording of the call.

Search: The city will begin searching for a new Chief of Police immediately and Captain Stan Pye will fill the position in the interim, as he has been serving as Acting Chief of Police since January 1

An investigation into the incident found that barking dogs woke McCollom from his sleep in the middle of the night, CNN reports. McCollom got up, grabbed his Glock 9mm gun -- his service gun -- and checked the house.

When McCollom returned to bed he placed the gun under the sheets. 

A forensic analysis confirmed that the gun had been fired from under the sheets and a wound on MCollom's right hand confirmed that his palm blocked a spent shell from leaving the gun, according to CNN. 

Ballard said investigators found no evidence that McCollom intended to harm Margaret. However, the prosecutor said the shooting could have been avoided.

He plans to ask a grand jury to charge McCollom with reckless conduct 'since the chief took a loaded gun to bed with him after ingesting alcohol and sleep medication.'

McCollom and his attorney did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

The city will begin searching for a new Chief of Police immediately, FOX reports. 

Captain Stan Pye will fill the position in the interim, as he has been serving as Acting Chief of Police since January 1. 

Prior to moving to Peachtree City, McCollom served as police chief in Tequesta, Florida, and as assistant chief in Delray Beach, Florida. He started his law enforcement career in Wyoming.

Court records show McCollom has divorced four times, including once from Margaret McCollom.

None of his divorce filings or police personnel files describe any instances of violence or recklessness.
