Colchester have promoted academy chief Tony Humes to the role of first-team manager following the departure of Joe Dunne.

The 48-year-old was a centre-half with Ipswich and Wrexham in his playing days and worked with the youth teams at both of those clubs before joining the U's in a similar capacity.

Dunne parted company with the club following a run of four straight League One defeats which left Colchester second bottom in the table.

Humes will be assisted by Richard Hall, who was working with the club's under-21s.
