Little Jaxon Brown is just two years old - but his talent would put Taylor Hawkins to shame.

In a video shot by his father, Justin, the toddler, from Canton, Ohio, rocks out on an electric drum kit, and shows a genuine talent, surprising in one so young. 

The youngster starts by lightly tapping the drums. But as soon as the song - Foo Fighters' hit The Pretender - reaches full pelt, he lets rip, bashing the drum kit with all his mite.

'Jaxon has been playing drums since he was 18 months old,' says his proud father.

'We have a nabi that the kids play games and watch youtube videos on, and he started watching videos I posted of drummers like Luke Holland, Cobus, and Chris Adler.

'Now, anything that looks like a drum stick IS a drum stick.'

Jaxon, two, and his father, Justin, share a love of rock music, which led to the toddler's love for drumming 

In action: The toddler has even perfected the head-nodding action of a rock drummer

During the video, the younger can be seen enthusiastically nodding his head to the beat and even yells along to the lyrics of the well-known rock anthem.

'I see him playing drums everyday so its nothing special to me, but I took a video just too show everyone how he could keep a beat,' said Mr Brown.
