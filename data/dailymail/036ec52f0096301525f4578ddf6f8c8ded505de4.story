An Australian photographer has won a prestigious international award in recognition of his beautiful and haunting photographs of the Australian landscape.

Christian Fletcher has been marked as an incredible talent worldwide, in the first inaugural International Landscape Photographer of the Year competition.

The images that won him the award feature the stunning landscape of Western Australia, a subject which Fletcher is extremely passionate about.

'The images are all about looking at what we do as a race to the country, that's the crux of the images' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We are mining a pristine, unique wilderness which has spawned amazing ecosystems and animals.' 

'There is so much apathy in the world, causing problems. I wanted these images to be a call to arms for people to question what's going on get back to looking hard at the world.' 

'Getting technically creative in order to tell a story, that's one of my favourite parts.' 

Despite being so passionate about his work now, Fletcher began his career as a photographer almost by mistake.

'I was really into surfing in my teens,' he said, 'and had an accident.'

'I picked up a camera when I couldn't get back into the water and just started taking photographs of the ocean.'

'I started to enjoy the process as much as surfing.'

Milford Sound, New Zealand: 'The images are all about looking at what we do as a race to the country, that's the crux of the images,' said Christian.

Bauxite Mine, Collie, Western Australia: This image was shot on the Phase One IQ180 camera. Christian wanted to create images that "reflected more than what the eye can see". He "wanted to show the detail that is there but often muffled and confused by lesser cameras".

Geographe Bay, Dunsborough, Western Australia: Christian said, 'We are mining a pristine, unique wilderness which has spawned amazing ecosystems and animals.'

After working various jobs until he was 25, Christian moved to the country to set up a dark room, and focused on perfecting the art of landscape photography.

'I was working all these jobs to support myself. One of them was in a picture framing store, and there was a gallery at the front that I rented to hang my pictures.'

'They started selling, and eventually someone said that I should photograph his sister's wedding.' 

'For years I did commercial and wedding photography, because there was just no money in landscape, although that's where my heart was.'

This hasn't changed in the intervening years. Christian, who has been a professional photographer for 26 years now, says that he is still in love with taking photos of what he calls 'altered landscapes.'

'Urban landscapes, industrial landscapes, things that have been affected from mining and the building of dams.'

'I would say I'm environmentally conscious. I am drawn to anything affected by humanity, which is just about everything these days,' he said.

'I think anyone who is a landscape photographer should care about the environment, almost more than anyone else.'

'I've created a group called Photographers for the Environment, which focuses on areas under threat.'

Queenstown, New Zealand: 'I would say I'm environmentally conscious. I am drawn to anything affected by humanity, which is just about everything these days,' Christian said.

Wanaka, New Zealand: 'I think anyone who is a landscape photographer should care about the environment, almost more than anyone else.'

Wanaka, New Zealand: Fletcher, who has been a professional photographer for 26 years now, says that he is still in love with taking photos of what he calls 'altered landscapes.'

Fletcher said he was surprised when his photographs made it into the final rounds of the international award. 

 'There were over 2000 photographs, and looking through them, they were amazing,' said Fletcher.

'I thought they were so much better than mine.'

'I had a couple of images in the top 101, but didn't think I had a chance at winning,' 

'I was shocked, to be honest. It's quite an honour to win.'

Fletcher said that the craft of photography has changed significantly since the advent of digital cameras and equipment.

'When I started out, it was like getting a present every time I got a roll of film developed. You could learn all the techniques but there was always an element of the unknown.'

'It used to take a lot longer to become a good photographer, and to really learn the craft of it. While it's still hard to master, photography is so different because of the digital equipment,' he said.

'There are a lot of photography enthusiasts, which is great, but they're working on the side of their actual jobs, just selling enough to pay for their equipment. This is destroying the professional industry because there is less work, and so many pictures out there.' 

But, Fletcher adds, the increased quality of images is astounding. 

'What people can do now is amazing,' he said.

'Film is great but it's nothing like the images we have now. Some images are almost perfect.' 

'It will eventually get to the stage where a camera is developed which will be able to see as well as an eye.'

Wanaka, New Zealand: 'It used to take a lot longer to become a good photographer, and to really learn the craft of it. While it's still hard to master, photography is so different because of the digital equipment,' Christian said.

Stirling Ranges, Western Australia: 'Film is great but it's nothing like the images we have now. Some images are almost perfect.'

Stirling Ranges, Western Australia: 'It will eventually get to the stage where a camera is developed which will be able to see as well as an eye.'

'A camera is just a dumb instrument,' said Fletcher.

'It doesn't adjust like an eye can. But one day it may be able to recreate exactly what we're seeing. Technology is constantly changing, and means we have to adapt.'

'It's not always easy to do, but it certainly keeps me on my toes.'

Fletcher explained that while he will always have a passion for affected landscapes, a lot of the images he takes are to capture beauty.

'It's what you would call décor photography. The photographs I took in New Zealand are all about showing how grand it is,' he said.

'I love finding the best light, capturing trees and fogs and epic locations. My whole business is about getting people to buy photos, and most people want to feel good bout the world.'

'There are so many terrible things going on, often people want to see something nice and have something beautiful to hang in their houses.' 

The landscape photographer said that it's this which keeps him passionate and interested in his work, which impacts on every part of his day. 

'No matter how many times you've been somewhere, there will always be an angle or image that is new. Being outdoors and on my own in a beautiful place, that's what I love. I'm a people person but it's just brilliant,' Fletcher said.

'I cant quite explain it. I have had a lot of passions in my life but this has always stayed. I'll never stop doing it, everything in my day revolves around it.'

Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia: 'A camera is just a dumb instrument,' said Fletcher.'It doesn't adjust like an eye can. But one day it may be able to recreate exactly what we're seeing. Technology is constantly changing, and means we have to adapt.'

 

Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia: Fletcher said, 'Sugarloaf Rock never fails to impress and is like a magent drawing me in when I should be shooting other places.'

Tailings Dam, Kwinana, Perth, Western Australia: 'I cant quite explain it. I have had a lot of passions in my life but this has always stayed. I'll never stop doing it, everything in my day revolves around it.'
