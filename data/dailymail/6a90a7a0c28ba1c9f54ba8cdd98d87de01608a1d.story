'But the meaning behind the photo isn't about me breastfeeding, it's about supporting mums,' said Ms Sharkey with her older son Ari

'From her recent graduation, this amazing photo and message was sent to us by inspiring mum Jacci Sharkey,' the a spokesperson for the university wrote before posting the message from Ms Sharkey.

'Just wanted to share a photo from the most recent graduation that I am proud of. I'm extremely proud that with the support of the uni, during my degree I was able to have 2 babies and still finish my degree. Thanks USC!'

The mum-of-two graduated with a Bachelor of Business, Human Resources Management and Marketing.

Ms Sharkey told Daily Mail Australia she shared the photo to encourage other mums to pursue their studies.

'It's a great message and I wanted to get it out there,' she said.

'I want mums to know that they can study and also be a mum. They don't have to give up either of them.'

Ms Sharkey says 'it was a a nice moment' when she breastfed her child just before heading into the graduation ceremony on October 2.

'I'm not going to hide something that's been done for centuries,' she said.

'But the meaning behind the photo isn't about me breastfeeding, it's about supporting mums.'

The photo also generated comments of support such as: 'What a beautiful photo such admiration for the mums who tackled parenthood and their degree.' 

One mother wrote: 'That's awesome, I have 4 children I had last one whilst studying at USC and was supported and able to continue studying whilst breastfeeding and bringing my son to some classes. Best uni! Studying and having a family is possible!'

A spokesman for the university told Daily Mail Australia the photo was reflective of their supportive academic staff.

However the photo was also met with backlash, some saying that breastfeeding is 'a beautiful private thing that does not need to be shared with the public'.

The criticism continued: 'This is deep connection that you can still have if you cover yourself, what is the big deal putting a blanket so you keep the moment to yourself.'

Another wrote: 'Urinating is natural, should we start doing it in public? Or defecating? Literally everyone does these things. If we put toilets in the street with no walls will people accept it as "beautiful" and "natural"? A breast out in public is still a breast out in public whether it's sexualized or for feeding a child. Just think about it.'

The photo also caused outrage for one particular mother who wrote: 'Have some respect for not only yourself but your child. I raised 5 and NEVER put my boob out there!! Why? I value my self respect.'

This comes after a British mother's photo, which captured the first moment she breastfed her premature baby daughter, was removed from Facebook as it 'breached nudity rules'.

The Daily Mail told how Emma Bond posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, nearly two week ago. The image was only viewable to those she had approved as online friends.

The 24-year-old was shocked when the site deleted it the same day after an unidentified person - believed to be one of her friends - reported it as offensive.

After hundreds of complaints, Facebook restored the photo and said it was 'removed in error'.
