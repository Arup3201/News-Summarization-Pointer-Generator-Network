Kolo Toure insists he has never felt better after beating malaria to prove his fitness in time for the World Cup.

The Liverpool centre-back was diagnosed with the illness at the end of last month after a trip back the Ivory Coast.

And having previously suffered from the disease back in 2008 while at Arsenal there were fears whether the 33-year-old would be fit for his country’s World Cup opener against Japan on Saturday.

But Toure says he is in the shape of his life – despite admitting he had to calm Liverpool doctors who were so concerned about his condition they were calling him trying to discover the severity of the illness.

‘I feel great,’ said Toure at Ivory Coast’s training camp outside Sao Paulo – flexing his muscles to prove his point.

‘The malaria was just for two days. Obviously we have the medical department that knows malaria very well and they gave me tablets. I was in bed for two days.

‘When they heard the news everyone was talking.

'I had a phone call from my club, from people around the world.

‘I’m absolutely fine because my body is used to that kind of sickness, it’s not the first time and it won’t be the last time.

Feeling great: Toure has shrugged off concerns about his well being

‘I feel great now, I’m training with the team. The manager makes me work harder which is very good for me. I feel great.’

And Toure believes this could finally be the time Ivory Coast’s golden generation shines on the big stage.

Brother 
Yaya is winning his battle to recover from a thigh injury suffered at 
Manchester City – ‘we will do everything to ensure he can play,’ said 
coach Sabri Lamouchi – so the Ivorians should have all their big guns 
ready for the kick-off.

And after 
two disappointing tournaments in difficult groups, Toure believes they 
can progress from a pool with Japan, Colombia and Greece to take the 
tournament by storm.

Scare: Toure missed the end of the Premier League season with the illness

‘There are plenty of good players for us to use,’ said Toure. ‘We will focus on us.

‘We know our quality, the players we have, and we have been working really really hard for two weeks.

‘We have been getting ready. We don’t think about any players from any other teams, we think about ourselves.

‘If we do what we can well I don’t think there are many teams that can stop us.’
