A mother who tried to sell her eight-month-old son for $7,000 has been jailed again.

Kenia Quiala Bosque, 30, was arrested for prowling last Thursday after police spotted her and another suspect acting suspiciously near an auto shop in the early hours.

She was taken to Monroe County Detention Center. Bosque, of Hialeah, Florida was also booked for violating her probation.

According to the Miami Herald, Sgt David Carey spotted a truck with its lights turned off by the auto shop around 1am on Thursday and two people moving around behind a fence.

Police approached Bosque and Julian Soca, 21, who could not explain their reasons for being at the closed business in Key Largo. Officers then discovered bolt cutters and gloves in the vehicle before one recognized Bosque.

In December, Bosque had arranged to meet a prospective buyer in Miami to hand over her newborn son for $7,000.

Police were tipped off about the sale and an undercover officer went to the meeting posing as the buyer leading to her arrest.

Bosque failed to show up for the transaction but police said they had enough evidence to arrest her on baby-selling charges.

The mother of-three was arrested at 
her home in Florida. Her two other children, a six and eight-year-old, 
were placed in the care of their biological father and he became acting 
parent for the baby boy. She is currently allowed supervised visits.

Bosque accepted a plea deal that spared her prison but required extensive counseling.

She was previously arrested for armed 
burglary and theft in November 2010 when she was accused of stealing 
copper wire from a shrimp farm in the Florida Keys.
