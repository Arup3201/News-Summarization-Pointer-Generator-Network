More than £600million of property inside London’s iconic Battersea Power Station has been sold in what has been described as a four-day stampede.

Buyers paid between £343,000 for a studio flat to £6million for a 
penthouse as 600 properties were snapped up between Thursday and Saturday, it has today been revealed.

It is believed to the 
fastest selling property development on record.

More than £600m of property inside London's redeveloped Battersea Power Station has been snapped up within four days

The rush for property at the iconic building is believed tobe the fastest selling property development on record

Investors paid reservation fees of around £2,500 for each of the 
properties, and will be expected to pay ten per cent of the overall asking price on exchange, which has to be within four weeks.

Sales opened on Thursday and by the time the sales centre at the riverside site closed on 
Saturday afternoon it is believed that 600 buyers, which included a former power 
station worker, had snapped up the properties.

Battersea Power Station Development Company chief executive Rob 
Tincknell likened the stampede to the start of a Harrods sale.

He said: 'It really has been phenomenal. We had people queuing from 6.30am on Thursday and the London allocation sold out in days.'

The most popular properties were those overlooking the Thames - which come with a multi-million tag.

The properties will now be touted to overseas buyers within the coming weeks over the course of various international sales exhibitions.

The wave of enthusiasm for the Battersea properties follows a recent surge in house prices, but drop in availability, in areas such as Kensington and Chelsea. 

The Battersea Power Station development will create 16.8 acres of public open space with over 400m of river frontage, of which nearly 6 acres will be a new riverside park alongside a proposed river-bus facility.The location of a new public park between the Power Station and the river will be a curated space with an extensive calendar of public events.The extensive open space around the Power Station will be known as ‘The Circus’ and is only marginally smaller than the Inner Circle of Regent’s Park.Upon completion in excess of 15,000 people will work at Battersea Power Station across retail, hospitality, commercial, service, community and creative sectors.

The first flats and houses are expected to be ready for occupation by 2016 and 2017 and Mr Tincknell is now comfortable all will be sold before building starts.

The redevelopment comes after nearly three decades of dereliction for Battersea Power Station. 

The power station was decommissioned in 1983 and has stood empty while a series of plans to redevelop it failed.

It is considered a prime example of 1930s Art Deco architecture and was made famous on the cover of Pink Floyd’s Animals album. 

Construction work on the site will begin in the summer and will see the removal and individual rebuilding of the four iconic white chimneys of the Grade-II building, to avoid their possible collapse.

Preparatory work on the site began in 2012, and the first properties are expected to be completed by 2016.

Since Battersea Power Station ceased generating electricity in the 1980s, development proposals for what is Europe's largest brick building have included a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about about everything in between.

Designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael
Vinoly, the complex known as Circus West comprises 1, 2 and 3 bedroom 
apartments, townhouses and penthouses.

It
will also be home to a business facility with offices, art galleries, a
Power Station Design shop, independent coffee shops, a boutique 
theatre, a 15,000sq ft. gym, an indoor swimming pool and a health spa.

Prices start from £343,000 for a studio, from £423,000 for a one-bedroom, from £613,000 for a two-bedroom and £894,000 for a three-bedroom apartment.

The UK sales programme will be followed by sales exhibitions around the world in the coming weeks.

The 39-acre site overlooks over 400 metres of London's River Thames, less than a mile and a half from the House of Parliament. It is directly opposite Chelsea and forms the cornerstone of London's last significant regeneration area, Nine Elms.

All residents will have access to an elevated residents garden, with apartments having an enclosed ‘Winter Garden’ that will provide useable outside space all year around, whilst the penthouses will have private rooftop terraces.
