A British photographer was smuggled out of the besieged Syrian city of Homs on a stretcher in a 26-hour operation that is reported to have seen a dozen volunteers killed.

The extraordinary escape of wounded Sunday Times cameraman and film-maker Paul Conroy into Lebanon along a 20-mile smuggling route came despite the continued withering bombardment of Homs.

But it emerged that three other journalists, including the badly injured French correspondent Edith Bouvier, had been separated from the 47-year-old Briton by the intensity of Syrian Army fire and forced to turn back.

This evening French President Nicolas 
Sarkozy said 31-year-old Bouvier, who works for Le Figaro, had been 
officially evacuated after 'tough negotiations.' He gave no details but 
said she was suffering from 'multiple fractures.'

News of the dramatic 
escape came as the total death toll in Syria climbed past 7,500, according to U.N. 
estimates.

The United Nations has reports that 'the death toll now often 
exceeds 100 civilians a day, including women and children.'

Mr Conroy, a former soldier and 
father-of-three, was said to be in 'good shape and good spirits' as he 
received treatment in Beirut for three leg wounds sustained last week 
during the shelling of a makeshift press centre in Homs that killed 
veteran correspondent Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik.

Speaking at the family home in Totnes,
Devon, Mr Conroy's wife, Kate, confirmed the release, adding : 'All I 
can say is that we are delighted and overjoyed at the news.'

Appeal: Rosemarie Colvin, the mother of journalist Marie Colvin, who was killed in Syria last week, today made an emotional appeal 'begging' for help as she told how she could not rest 'with my daughter's remains in that country'

His father 
Les described his son as being in 'very good spirits,' adding : 'We're 
all very relieved and happy that Paul's out.' After several frustrated 
attempts to rescue the injured and recover the two bodies, Mr Conroy and
his colleagues had taken the decision to try and escape with the help 
of Syrian volunteers during a respite in the shelling of Homs on Sunday 
night.

They chose instead to take their 
chances along the precarious smuggling route which had successfully 
taken 40 wounded Syrians out of the country to neighbouring Lebanon in 
the previous six days.

The route, which is in nightly use to 
ferry in medical supplies and food and to extract the wounded from Homs,
was established 10 months ago by Syrian activists with the help of 
Avaaz, the human rights campaign group.

'That night all four decided to go for
it,' the Avaaz spokesman in Beirut said, 'They wanted to go together. 
So the activists that we co-ordinate got them all to the exit place from
the actual neighbourhood where they had been waiting.

'From that point the operation went 
wrong. They were shelled. Three activists were killed, and Paul Conroy 
was the only one to get out. The others got split up, and we believe 
that they turned back to Homs.'

David Cameron chaired a meeting of the
Government’s National Security Council (NSC) today which focused on how
to increase the political and economic pressure on the Bashar Assad 
regime.

Although Syria has been discussed at 
previously meetings of the NSC, it was the first to be devoted 
exclusively to the escalating crisis in the Middle Eastern country.

It was attended by senior ministers as
well as the Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards, said the
Prime Minister’s spokesman. Further NSC meetings are expected in the 
coming weeks.

Asked if military options, such as the
supply of weapons to rebels, were also discussed, the spokesman said: 
‘The focus of our efforts is on how we can bring further political and 
economic pressure to bear.’

He added: ‘The purpose of the meeting 
was to take stock of the situation. Clearly there is a very challenging 
situation in Syria.

‘The Prime Minister believes that 
there is a moral imperative for the international community to do more 
to stop the violence and support a political solution in Syria.

‘They were discussing different economic and political options to bring pressure on the regime.’

The possibility of seeking a UN 
Security Council resolution narrowly focused on humanitarian issues in 
the hope of gaining the support of Russia and China, who refused to back
a resolution condemning the violence, was ‘one option we would be 
considering’, said the spokesman.

However he stressed that there was as yet no international consensus on any of the issues surrounding Syria.

Amid great secrecy, Mr Conroy continued 
with his helpers towards the border. 'The route is very complex because 
they are dodging the Syrian army, minefields and a huge military base,' 
the spokesman explained.

'They get to one position, they talk 
to each other very quickly by satellite phone, decide whether it's safe,
then move again. Sometimes motorbikes are used.

'They were shelled again and more of 
our activists were killed. We don't know exactly how many but we think 
about 10. Paul went into hiding again and we finally got him out after 
26 hours from start to finish.'

There is no news on whether the bodies 
of Ms Colvin or Ochlik had been moved from Homs but her mother, 
Rosemarie Colvin made an emotional appeal today 'begging' for help 
as she told how she could not rest 'with my daughter's remains in that 
country'.

Speaking on the BBC, she said she 
would not accept the award winning correspondent being buried in Syria, 
insisting : 'No, I can't accept that...I want my daughter back.

'Sometime, somehow we will bring her 
home. I can't rest myself, I can't have peace in my life with my 
daughter's remains in that country. I think that mothers listening to me
would feel the same way and understand how a mother feels.

'Anyone who can help in any way, I 
would just beg them to do it.'

She added: 'I'm going to miss her. I 
didn't want her to be the cause or the reason but I do wish that her 
death does mean something and that perhaps it would help to end some of 
these terrible, terrible things that are happening.'

Meanwhile today U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad could be tried for war crimes, but has admitted 
pursuing charges against him could make it more difficult to persuade 
him to give up power.

Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki said he is ready to 
offer asylum to Syria's leader Bashar Assad and senior figures in his 
regime as part of a negotiated solution to end the Syrian conflict.

Tunisia would be a surprising choice 
for Assad's retirement as it was the first Arab nation to topple a 
longtime autocrat when its former president fled the country a year ago 
in the face of protests.

During a
stormy meeting today, the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva
called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said
she had received reports that 'massive campaigns of arrests' by Syrian 
troops against rebels had deprived many civilians of food, water and 
medical supplies.

Syria's representative to the UN, 
Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, stormed out of the session, accusing countries of
"inciting sectarianism and providing arms".

Homs was said to have come 
under some of its heaviest bombardment yet, with the government sending 
in units of an elite armoured division into rebel-held districts.

The Syrian government appears to have 
stepped up its offensive against rebels across the country this week - 
sending forces into several towns in northern Syria for the first time. 
Up to 144 people died in Syria on Monday, many of them in a single 
incident at a checkpoint in Homs, the opposition said.
