George Zimmerman, pictured in a mug shot taken on Saturday, allegedly threw a bottle at his girlfriend

George Zimmerman became so enraged when his girlfriend tried to break up with him that he threw a wine bottle at her head, according to a police report about his latest arrest.

The wine bottle did not hit the woman, who fled the house in her car and was later pulled over by officers who had seen her leaving the home.

Zimmerman has denied throwing the bottle and disputed another claim that he had destroyed her cell phone, according to the report, which chronicles his latest run-in with police since he was acquitted of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2013.

The former neighborhood watch volunteer was arrested Friday in Lake Mary, Florida and charged with aggravated assault in the January 5 incident. He was released Saturday on $5,000 bond.  

In the report, officers said they had been patrolling the neighborhood where Zimmerman lives when they heard the sound of glass shattering, and saw the former girlfriend drive out of the driveway. 

They pulled her over for a traffic stop a few streets over because she didn't have her lights on.

She explained that Zimmerman became angry after she told him she didn't want to take the relationship further. She added that they argued over a painting she had that he wanted returned. 

Zimmerman made threats and threw the wine bottle, which didn't hit her, she said.

Denial: Zimmerman denied throwing the bottle at the unidentified woman's head. She told police they had fought after she broke up with him and he demanded she give back a painting that he owned 

When detectives found her inside the car, she was 'extremely emotional, crying, mad and upset' and called her former boyfriend 'that psycho, George Zimmerman'.

She said she should have known better than to get involved with him. 

The ex-girlfriend, whose name is redacted, told investigators that she had had an 'intimate relationship' with Zimmerman since the end of last year.

'She indicated that this began at a time when she was emotionally vulnerable,' the report said. 

But the officers added that she became reluctant to cooperate when she realized that officers might be conducting an investigation. 

Zimmerman was arrested at his house on Friday, four days after the confrontation.

Detectives said in the police report that he refused to come to the door for more than two hours despite their repeated knocking. They said they could hear the television on and a dog barking.

Zimmerman eventually came outside after police officers agreed to allow him to keep his attorney on his cell phone with him while he was interviewed, the report said.

Speaking to officers, he insisted he was only trying to prevent her from entering his home.

Before he was released, he was also told by the judge to stay out of Volusia County, where the woman lives.

The judge ordered Zimmerman to pack up any personal belongings his girlfriend may have left at Zimmerman's home and give them to his lawyer.

He is scheduled to appear back in court on February 17.

After the arrest, his attorney Don West admitted his client 'has not been lucky with the ladies.' Both his ex-wife, Shellie Zimmerman, and his ex-girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, called 911 to accuse him of domestic violence. 

Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013 of a second-degree murder charge for shooting Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

The Justice Department has yet to say whether it will file federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who said he shot Martin in self-defense during a confrontation in February 2012. Relatives of Martin accused Zimmerman of racially profiling the teen. 

November 2013: He was arrested on charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief after his then-girlfriend said he pointed a gun at her face during an argument, smashed her coffee table and pushed her out of the house they shared. Samantha Scheibe decided not to cooperate with detectives and prosecutors didn't pursue the case.

September 2012: He then was accused by his estranged wife of smashing an iPad during an argument at the home they had shared. Shellie Zimmerman initially told a dispatcher her husband had a gun, though she later said he was unarmed. No charges were ever filed because of a lack of evidence. The dispute occurred days after Shellie Zimmerman filed divorce papers.

 Zimmerman has also been pulled over three times for traffic violations since his acquittal
