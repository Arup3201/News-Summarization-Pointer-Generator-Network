A grandfather who was given just two years to live after being diagnosed with leukaemia is in remission - just weeks after taking a new 'miracle' drug that could give new hope to millions of cancer sufferers.

Douglas Clarke was one of just 100 patients across the world chosen to try the new anti-cancer treatment.

Doctors put the 59-year-old forward for the drug trial while he was waiting for a life-saving bone marrow transplant from his brother.

Just three weeks into the trial the dad-of-three was told he was in remission and could live for another 30 years.

New lease of life: Douglas Clarke with his wife Kerry Clarke and his son Bradley. Mr Clarke is in remission from cancer after trying an experimental drug

Today, Mr Clarke, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with his wife Kerry, 42, and their son Bradley, nine, said he felt like he had 'won the lottery'.

He said: 'Thanks to this miracle drug I feel brilliant. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

'I was the guinea pig - but I couldn't have asked for a better treatment.

'This treatment could be used for everyone who has leukaemia as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant.

'I now have to take these tablets for the rest of my life. It has given me another 30 years of my life instead of the two-and-a-half the doctor said before I took the drug.

ABT-199 is currently in the second phase of development but medics hope it will go on the market.

'My family has kept me going throughout. This whole thing has made me look at life differently.

'When they told me I was in remission it was like winning the lottery. I've had a lot of support and I just can't believe the results.'

Douglas, who works as a caretaker at a golf club, was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphonic Leukaemia (CLL) in 2011 and was preparing for a bone marrow transplant this year.

But he was offered a life-changing chance to take part in a trial of the new ABT-199 anti-cancer drug at The Christie Hospital in Manchester which started last month.

The trial saw grandad-of-four Douglas take four tablets a day every day until he reached the maximum dosage.

And remarkably, after just three weeks his swollen lymph nodes had reduced and his bone marrow had returned to normal - killing off the leukaemia.

Douglas, who has two sons Shane, 40, and Adam, 32, from a previous marriage, added: 'I was working at the golf club in 2011 when I had a twinge in my back.

'So I went to the doctors and when I was there I asked them to take a look at some lumps on my neck.

'I had a blood test and was referred to hospital and they did tests and scans and told me I had CLL.

'I had chemotherapy which put it in remission for 18 months but then I noticed the lumps were back at the end of 2012.They referred me to a consultant in Birmingham to talk about a bone marrow transplant and we found my brother Keith was a perfect match.

'The consultant said if you don't have the bone marrow then I can give you just two years to live.

'I could've had the bone marrow but because of the tests on my brother it was going on and on and then they offered me the trial in Manchester.

'After just three weeks the consultant said he couldn't even feel the lymph nodes and said he can guarantee I am in remission.

'It felt like a great big lump of concrete has been lifted off my shoulders.. I don't think we've come down yet.

'It (the trial drug) gives hope to people that it can eradicate the process of going through a bone marrow transplant.'

Douglas' wife, Kerry, said she feels 'very lucky' her husband took part in the trial.

The catering supervisor, who has two daughters Katie, 21, and Tanisha, 18, also from a previous relationship, said: 'I was a bit sceptical about the drug at first but after the first week I could see it was working so I tried to support him.'

She added: 'When we were told he was in remission I just burst into tears. I was so happy. Now we are trying to get back to normality. We haven't been able to go on holiday for the past three years so we are looking forward to that.'

The drug has been manufactured in Australia to treat CCL sufferers.

It is currently in the second phase of development but medics hope it will go on the market.

Consultant haematologist Doctor Adrian Bloor, who has been overseeing the trial at The Christie, said the drug was so successful that he had cured patients in just an hour.

ABT-199 switches off the Bcl-2 protein, allowing the CLL cells to die naturally and making them susceptible to chemotherapy, so it is more effective in killing cancer cells.

It is currently in the second phase of development but medics hope it will go on the market.

In a clinical trial in Melbourne last year, people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who had an extremely poor prognosis achieved an 84 per cent response rate and the bone marrow cancer was cleared in 23 per cent of people.

Anthony Steele, the Leukaemia Foundation of Australiaâ€™s Head of Support Services, said: 'This drug means people with an incurable cancer, who undergo many periods of intensive treatment, periods of remission and with an expectation that the disease will relapse, now have hope that a treatment will be made available to end this life-long cycle.'

He said: 'We are one of a few centres in the world trialling it and it has been spectacularly successful, so much so that it caused quite a few problems at first.

'We even had a couple of patients die from taking it because their bodies could not cope with it. So we did have to go back to the drawing board.

'It came as a big surprise in terms of how spectacularly effective it was. It was outstanding and is a miracle drug.

'We have seen patients who have taken the drug and in just one hour they were clear of the disease. It is overwhelmingly effective.

'This drug has really transformed what we believed we could do.

'It would be very difficult for us to achieve what we have with other readily-available treatments, so there will be a lot of enthusiasm to try to get this on the market.'
