President Barack Obama has now attended at least 400 fundraisers since taking office.

CBS Radio journalist Mark Knoller, the network’s White House
correspondent, made the revelation Monday on Twitter.

'By my count,' he tweeted, 'Obama [is] attending his 400th
political fundraiser this evening on Martha's Vineyard.'

President George W. Bush 'had done 224 fundraisers' at the
same point in his presidency, he added.

Bush ended his two White House terms having conducted 318
fundraisers, a total Obama reached more than a year ago.

Knoller is known in the White House press room as an amiable cataloger of presidential miscellany, sometimes with better records than the
White House itself is willing to share.

The Republican National Committee said in a fundraising email Monday
morning that by its count, Obama had already
conducted 400 fundraisers.

That would make Monday night’s dinner, where
Democratic voters paid between ranged $15,000 and $32,400 to see the president
speak for 12 minutes, his 401st money-raising event.

Several news outlets took that line, declaring that on
Monday Obama 'surpassed' 400 fundraisers while living at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue.

Whichever total is correct, the president has been picking
up the pace of his hat-passing as November's elections draw near: The fundraiser-in-chief has attended seven such
events since mid-July.

Despite Obama's association with high-dollar donor events, it's Bill Clinton who holds the fundraising record, appearing at 638 events throughout his two terms in office.

President Obama would have to hold nearly six times as many fundraisers as he's headlined this year - so far - during his final two and a half years in office in order to catch up with Clinton.

For now, Obama is switching out his fundraising hat for his golfing cap while on vacation at Martha's Vineyard, though.

The president played his 187th round of golf today, and it was his third time on the green since he arrived on the Massachusetts island last Saturday afternoon.
