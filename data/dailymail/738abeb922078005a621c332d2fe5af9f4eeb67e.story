Stoke striker Peter Crouch is perhaps most famous for his robot dance in 2006, but Monday night saw him coin a new trademark celebration - the birdie.

Eight years on from his memorable dance after scoring for England against Jamaica, Crouch beat Newcastle's Fabricio Coloccini in the air to head home for Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, and what followed next certainly caught the eye of many.

The 33-year-old striker, who is married to Abbey Clancy, wheeled away from goal after putting the home side 1-0 up, and pulled out a new celebration to rival the robot.

Lifting both arms in the air, Crouch mimicked a bird, much to the delight of his team-mates, and a large television and Twitter audience.

When questioned after the match about the celebration, Crouch responded: 'My mate is a Geordie and that's one of his moves. He said I was allowed to do it if I scored, so that one was for him.'

Crouch has made 459 professional appearances in a career spanning 14 years, but it is fair to say that he may be remembered more fondly for his celebrations than his goals.

He joined Stoke in 2011 for £10 million, and his opener on Monday night was his third goal of the 14/15 season.
