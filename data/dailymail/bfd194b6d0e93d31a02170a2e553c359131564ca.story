In the awkward encounter, the First Lady of China happily waved at the crowd, beaming in her detailed purple dress.

However, her smile slightly dropped when she noticed her famous husband had his hand down by his side, refusing to wave to the audience.

With one harsh side glance from Lady Liyuan, Mr Xi inping's hand shot into the air, fearing the wrath of his lady love.

Following his confident wife's lead, Mr Xi plastered a smile on his face and proceeded to wave intently at the delighted audience.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian leader Tony Abbott also blanked the audience, preferring to keep their hands by their side instead of partaking in the welcoming wave. 

Xi’s wife, Peng Liyuan, who was once a popular folk singer, is famous in her own right in China and has taken on a very public role as the First Lady.

Officials in China have worked hard to build up the image of Mr Xi and Lady Peng as a wholesome, loving couple.

Photos have been distributed of Mr Xi picking flowers for his beloved wife, holding an umbrella over her head in the rain and lovingly holding her hand on official assignments. 

These photos have been circulated on Chinese social media and have prompted a lot of adoration from the Chinese public.  

President Putin caused controversy on Tuesday when he draped his coat across Ms Peng's shoulders during a chilly night in Beijing

Xi was previously married to Ke Lingling, in early 1980s, however the couple divorced within a few years of marrying.

The 61-year-old married  Peng Liyuan in 1987 and the couple have one daughter together, Xi Mingze, who attended Harvard University.

President Putin caused controversy on  Tuesday when he draped his coat across Ms Peng's shoulders during a chilly night in Beijing. 

Mr Putin is seen as a heartthrob among most Chinese woman because of his macho image.  

Mr Xi came across as inattentive to his  wife's needs at the event. 

Chinese authorities, who were broadcasting the performance as part of a special TV segment dedicated to the summit, quickly moved to remove the video of Putin's act of chivalry from all social media and online forums, fearing Mr Xi's image would be tarnished.
