With his hands proudly on his hips, and a satisfied smile betraying his excitement, Horatio Chapple stands at the edge of a glacier on Svalbard, Norway, posing for a photo with his friends.

Two days later the 17-year-old would be mauled to death by a 39-stone polar bear.

The last photo of the Eton College pupil shows him as 'strong, fearless and kind', and 'on the cusp of adulthood' - how he was described by his devastated parents David and Olivia.   

Meanwhile, the father of a teenager who survived last week's attack has described his son's heroics which left him with the creature's teeth embedded in his skull.

Patrick Flinders suffered a fractured skull after punching the 14ft polar bear in the face during the attack which saw his friend Horatio 'ripped to pieces'.

The 16-year-old has been hailed a 'hero' by his father after 'fighting for his life' during the horrific episode on Friday.

Terry Flinders said his son was bitten on the arm and swiped in the face by the 250kg animal before Patrick tried to defend the group by jumping on the bear and 'smashing its nose' as it attacked their tent.

Horatio Chapple died following the attack on Spitsbergen island, Norway, while Patrick, from Jersey, along with friend Scott Bennell-Smith, 16, survived and were flown to the UK on Sunday.

Patrick underwent surgery to remove the bear's teeth from his skull and is now said to be 'conscious and lucid' at Southampton General Hospital.

Trip leaders Michael 'Spike' Reid, 29, from Plymouth and Andrew Ruck, 27, who is from Brighton but lives in Edinburgh, were severely injured in the bear attack, but are now stable.

Mr Reid shot the bear dead, but was also mauled himself.

Terry Flinders said the ordeal his son went through would have affected 'even hardened SAS men', as his son and Mr Bennell-Smith saw Hortatio attacked in the same tent.

Mr Flinders told the BBC Today 
programme: 'Scott shot but did not kill the bear, which then went for 
Patrick, he bit his arm and then just swiped his face and top of his 
head. And then the same with Scottie.

'Patrick said he can't remember doing it, but I suppose it might come back to him later.'

'We are a small community here and he has become a hero.

'I've told him the girls will love 
him for his bravery, and he will be able to walk through town on a 
Friday night without any trouble because people will know him as the guy
who punched a 14ft polar bear.

'If three SAS men, who are hardened 
people, had been in those tents and saw what Patrick and Scott saw - 
their friend being ripped to pieces - they must be affected by that, let
alone a 16-year-old who fought for his life.

'His injuries are not my biggest worry because in six months time they will all be gone.

'But it must stay in his head and I don't see how anyone could put up with that.'

Patrick's parents had previously thought he had only been bitten on the arm and swiped in the face by the bear.

Mr Flinders added: 'I was told he had a broken skull, and said I didn't know about that.

'He had an operation to remove parts of the bear's teeth from his skull, and the surgeons did a fantastic job on him.'

Scott's father, Peter, said in a statement that Friday was the worst day of his life.

'It will never leave me to think how close Scott came to being killed that day,' he said.

'I am so sorry for the loss of his new friend and fellow adventurer, Horatio. It is every parent's worst nightmare.'

The family of Horatio paid tribute to him in a statement, describing him as 'strong, fearless and kind'.

They said Mr Chapple had been 'so excited about his plans to be a doctor' and praised his 'amazing sense of humour and ability to laugh at himself'.

Eton College, where Mr Chapple was a pupil, expressed its deep sadness at the schoolboy's death and offered its condolences to his family and friends.

The attack on the campsite near the Von Post glacier about 25 miles (40km) from Longyearbyen, took place early on Friday.
