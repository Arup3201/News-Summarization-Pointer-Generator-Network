A woman recovered the diamond from her £18,000 engagement ring two days after her German Shepherd swallowed it.

Jack, a trainee police dog, chewed up the family heirloom on December 23 after Angie Collins put it on a side table while she manicured her nails.

Before she knew what had happened, Jack spat out the mangled gold band and swallowed the jewel.

Found: Angie Collins waited with German Shepherd Jack for two days until her diamond emerged

Mrs Collins, 51, from Exmouth in Devon, said: 'It must have winked at him. I went to the kitchen, came back and it was gone.'

The civil servant, who looks after police puppies while they are being trained, scrambled around the floor with husband Graham but the other half was nowhere to be found.

'My husband and I emptied the entire room bit by bit which took hours,' she said.

'I could only conclude that Jack had eaten it.

'The vet said because a dog’s stomach is so intricate it was unlikely I would get it back.'

But she was not prepared to give up.

'As a dog walker you always keep your pet’s poop in a bag so I took it home and sprayed it with the hose pipe and sieved it every single day - four times a day at least,' she said.

She spent Christmas Day waiting and finally, in the third lot of mess, it emerged.

'I had almost given up, so it was the last shot.

Disaster: The band was found mangled on the floor and the jewel nowhere to be seen on December 23

'I thought it was futile.

'But the sun was shining, and there it was.'

Jack was unharmed by his ordeal and is now just four weeks from being assigned a police handler.

The ring was one of five Angie left out, including her gold wedding band, but none are worth anywhere near as much.

The grandmother-of-one, who has been looking after police dogs for the past 18 years, said: 'It's got tremendous sentimental value so I'm delighted to have it back.

'It's absolutely mangled at the moment but I'm going to get it reset and insured as soon as possible.

'I've had dozens of police dogs but I've never had one who likes to snack on jewellery.'
