Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity.

In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room.

Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes.

They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's room  on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints

The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday.  Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. 

Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime.

Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles.

While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer.

Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien.

Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007

Rumors that a new player might be added 
to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions 
were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black 
female comediennes in LA.

The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times
 that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the 
first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season.

'All told we've seen about 25 people,'
 Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. 
Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.'

Michaels
 also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was 
initially hiring for the current season this past fall.

He
 saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their 
performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for 
the final auditions.

'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said.

That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season.

Michaels
 says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of 
the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them 
into the last episodes of the season.

While many have criticized the show 
for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady 
Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do 
with his hiring decision.

'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.'

This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show.

Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live
 has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the 
1985-86 season on the show

No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since

The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag.

As a result, there have been no 
sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington.

'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial.

Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past

'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.'

News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet.

Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance.

'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com.

'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said.

It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured)

Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel.

'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said.

'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.'

The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.
