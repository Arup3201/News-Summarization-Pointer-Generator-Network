The Royal Mail is refusing to deliver post to a house after a postman claims he was bitten by one of the Queen's favourite dogs.

The postman says he was attacked by a corgi belonging to homeowner Jean Parker, 75, who will now be forced to get a taxi to pick up her mail. But Mrs Parker is adamant her beloved pet would do no such thing.

She is furious at the Royal Mail for witholding her post and wrongly accusing her corgi, Leo, who is a 'little gem'.

Mrs Parker said: said: 'Everybody loves him. The vet says he's a little gem. He's got a good reputation'

Royal Mail said its postman required hospital treatment after being bitten but Mrs Parker, from Gosport, Hampshire, claims there wasn't a mark on him.

She said: 'My dog was outside saying goodbye to my sister's carers, they love him.

'It was raining so I threw a towel over him to dry him off. I didn't hear the postman come in through the gate.

'Leo ran out and he didn't get near enough before I called him back. The postman then started to look at his leg saying the dog had bitten him.

Upset: Mrs Parker said the Royal Mail decision is leaving her without important mail

'He had shorts on and I looked and there was nothing there - no marks, scrapes or blood.

'Leo is ten years old and doesn't even have that many teeth any more.

'He is so friendly and doesn't bite. But even if he did he would only be able to gum you.'

Mrs Parker said the Royal Mail decision is leaving her without important mail such as notice of hospital appointments.

She saw the postman a few days later and approached him - only to be told she would not be getting any post.

She said: 'It is very worrying that I am not getting post.

'I'm waiting for appointments from the hospital, for news of my sister who is unwell and for bills. I'm expecting mail from abroad with bad news in.

'No-one will talk to me or tell me happening.

'No-one can tell me anything and the depot won't even tell me the manager's name.

'They said they are investigating but I have not heard anything.

'They should not be holding on to it. People have paid for stamps in the belief it will be delivered.'

She said that Leo, a rescue dog she got three years ago, would never harm the postman.

She said: 'Everybody loves him. The vet says he's a little gem. He's got a good reputation.

'Why this maniac has decided to say this is beyond me. I am not going to say my dog has bitten him, when he did not.'

Royal Mail confirmed Mrs Parker's post was being withheld while it is conducting an investigation into the matter. 

Corgis are an active and sociable breed. They love being where the action is and will play rough and tumble games with children. They make good companions for elderly people.

The corgi learns quickly and as long as he knows what is expected of him he will oblige. However if left to his own devices he will get up to mischief - mainly chewing something.

The corgi is a good house dog and will bark furiously at the door bell. Excessive barking should not be encouraged.

The corgi is a 'big dog in a small body' and can become 'bossy' if not trained with a firm but gentle hand. A lot of new owners make the mistake of treating the Corgi as a toy breed.

The Corgi has an IQ equivalent to a five-year-old and will test authority.

The Queen has been fond of corgis since she was a small child and has owned more than 30 corgis she ascended to the throne.
