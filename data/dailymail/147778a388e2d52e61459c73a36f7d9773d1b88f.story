Damaging: Apple has been portrayed as a corporate bully that allegedly lead an illegal scheme to raise the prices of e-books

Apple has been portrayed as a corporate bully that allegedly lead an illegal scheme to raise the prices of e-books, in a civic trial today.

The Justice Departmentâ€™s suit claims that the Silicon Valley giant forced an end to price 
competition and costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.

Justice Department attorney, Lawrence Buterman, said a dramatic price increase in e-books was 'no accident or unforeseen outcome' but the result of a deliberate plan by Apple and five book publishers to eliminate Amazon's $9.99 bargain price for popular e-books.

He asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is overseeing a trial expected to last several weeks, to find that the computer company had violated anti-trust laws.

Apple lawyer Orin Snyder sharply 
disputed the government's claims, saying the company had been waiting 
eagerly for its chance to show it had enhanced competition and improved 
the e-book industry.

'Apple
is going to trial because it did nothing wrong,' he said. 'Apple did 
not conspire with any publisher individually, collectively or otherwise 
to raise industry prices.'

He
called the government's case bizarre, saying: 'Even our government is 
fallible, and sometimes the government just gets it wrong.'

Buterman
said the scheme to boost prices to $12.99 and $14.99 was encouraged by 
Steve Jobs, the late founder of the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer 
giant.

The lawyer said he would display 
emails and other correspondence that showed Jobs was active in the 
company's efforts to control e-book prices as Apple was preparing to 
launch the iPad.

Bullies? Federal prosecutors say Apple colluded with publishers to push Amazon.com out of the e-book market

The nonjury trial results from a lawsuit last year that accused the company of seeking to enter the market for e-books in 2010 in a way that would guarantee it 30 percent profits. A separate court proceeding could be conducted to quantify harm to consumers.

'Apple's conduct cannot be excused,' Buterman said. 'Consumers in this country paid hundreds of millions of dollars more for e-books than they would have.'

But Snyder said a ruling against Apple would mark the first time in anti-trust law history in which a new entrant in a market was condemned when its presence benefited consumers.

He said Apple entered an 'e-book market that was broken, lacked innovation, lacked competition and was heading nowhere good.'

He said publishers fought a pricing arrangement that the government said would guarantee Apple 30 percent profits, so it defies logic to insist there was collusion.

'The government is asking your honor to proceed on a perilous path,' Snyder said.

The
trial's first witness, Kevin Saul, testified that Apple knew publishers
were interested in charging higher prices for e-books when it entered 
the market. He said Apple arranged a different pricing model with 
publishers than Amazon.com had because Apple realized it would lose 
money otherwise.

He said Apple was indifferent to how its competitors dealt with publishers.

'We were focused solely on opening an e-books store for Apple,' Saul said.

Five
publishers named in the lawsuit have settled. The judge had urged Apple
to do the same, though she assured Apple a fair trial Monday, saying: 
'The deck is not stacked against Apple unless the evidence stacks the 
deck against Apple.'
