Russia may have access to American top secret intelligence and battle plans, the Head of the Defense Intelligence Agency announced on NPR on Friday.

Lt.Gen Micheal Flynn warned U.S. officials that they should prepare for the worst case scenario following the Edward Snowden leak detailing the ins and outs of the U.S. surveillance network.

Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden is seeking asylum in Moscow after following his information leak to The Guardian last year and the United States Intelligence committee can only assume that Russia already has some information from Snowden or that they are trying to obtain it.

'If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries â€” in this case, of course, Russia,' Flynn said.

Flynn is worried about what else Snowden may know because he may have information about technology and weapons systems, operational capabilities, and intelligence capabilities, reports CNN.

Re-vamping the U.S. surveillance network and changing military tactics is essential to national security but will be an arduous process.

'We really don't know' what Snowden's got, Flynn said.

'we have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised,' he warned.

He said that if Russia had U.S. intelligence, which they very well may, that it's very 'serious.'

According to Flynn and and the Director of U.S. intelligence James Clapper, Snowden's leaks have already posed a threat to U.S. National Security.

The leak has caused the U.S. to lose critical information sources.

'What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs,' Clapper said back in January.

'As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners.'

Terrorists who make it a priority to familiarize themselves with American intelligence agencies will be more prepared than ever to go under the radar.

'Snowden claims that he's won and that his mission is accomplished,' Clapper added.

'If that is so, I call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to U.S. security.'

Flynn chimed in and said, 'the greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm's way.'

Russia has stirred up the battlefield recently and has stationed troop is in the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine.
