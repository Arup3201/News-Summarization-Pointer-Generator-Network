For five elite golfers, this year looks particularly laden with significance. All five have reached a crossroads in their glorious careers.  What lies ahead is a season where dreams will be realised or doubts will really start to surface as to whether they will reach the summit of their ambition. Five reasons, then, why this will be another compelling year for intrigue.

Straight and narrow: Tiger Woods hits a ball across the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey

Tiger Woods

Being generous, you could give him a free pass over the fact that he was never a contender at last year's majors. They didn't set up well for him - and he did win five other tournaments to reclaim his position as the best player in the world. This year, three of the majors are at courses where he has won in the past and the US Open takes place at Pinehurst, where he finished second in 2005. If he doesn't win this year, he will fall off the pace regarding Jack Nicklaus's all-time record haul of 18 majors for the first time. In other words, no majors this year and catching Nicklaus will recede into the realms of the outlandish.

Lee Westwood

Never mind winning that elusive first major. Right now he faces a heck of a fight simply to make Europe's Ryder Cup team. The clear back-marker among the serious contenders for Gleneagles in September, the 40-year-old has slipped to 25th in the world and hasn't won a tournament for 18 months. Another season like last year and the Englishman will be struggling to stay in the top 50. A year like no other coming up, then. Let's hope it brings the best out of him.

Right time: Phil Mickelson has chance to complete the career Grand Slam

Slippery slope: Lee Westwood must rediscover his form and fast

Phil Mickelson

IN 1999, the US Open was at Pinehurst and Mickelson finished second - then became a father for the first time the following day. This time, he will celebrate his 44th birthday on the day following the event in mid-June. The storied North Carolina venue could have been built with Mickelson's game in mind. And so, if he is ever to complete the career Grand Slam and win his first national title after no fewer than six runner-up finishes, it has to be this year.

Sergio Garcia

The previous year ended not only in a victory in Thailand for the Spaniard but also saw him the most content he has been in ages in the arms of his new love. A big ask, we know, but can the sweet senorita who carried his clubs that week also carry off the part of psychologist and keep the moody, mercurial one in a happy place during the four majors? Born in the same year as Adam Scott and Justin Rose, this has the feel of a now-or-never year if he is to follow their recent examples.

Focused: Ian Poulter believes he can win his first major this year

Happy days: It could be now or never for Sergio Garcia

Ian Poulter

The popular Englishman will celebrate his 38th birthday later this week and do so at the top of the Ryder Cup qualifying charts after his marvellous finish to last year, but he's still smarting over his failure to muster a victory in 2013. Poulter truly believes he can put that right and then some this year and win his first major - and you can see where he is coming from. The stars may never be more  perfectly aligned for him than they are in 2014.

'The world's most interesting golfer' is the accolade that a leading American website paid last week to the colourful Spaniard, Miguel Angel Jimenez. He's certainly among the most remarkable. Who gave him a prayer at his time of life of recovering fully from a serious skiing accident this time last year? Yet here he is, celebrating his 50th birthday at the European Tour's calendar year opener in South Africa this week by targeting a Ryder Cup place - and why not, having won as recently as last month in Hong Kong? He's living proof that a man who can putt will give any golfing gym rat a run for his money.

Rory silences sirens in his head

Three months ago, we talked about the siren voices in Rory McIlroy's head that were preventing him from playing properly. Since then, he's set about quietening them one by one. Resolving a court case with Oakley? Check. Sorting out some swing issues and restoring confidence? Check. Feeling content away from the course and shutting up those malicious Irish newspaper gossip  columnists once and for all? Check. I've written before about my belief that this will be the year of the comeback for the newly engaged McIlroy. It is one that we should all eagerly anticipate.

Quote of the week

'I mean, it's just like anyone else's grandad. Just he played golf for a living.'  Nick O'Leary, one of the stars of the Florida State Seminoles college football team, gets asked about his relative. And the grandad in question, who just played golf for a living? Jack Nicklaus.
