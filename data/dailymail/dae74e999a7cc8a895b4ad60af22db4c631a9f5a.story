Accomplished designer, respected film director and all round king of cool, Tom Ford has long been the fashion man who can do no wrong.

But earlier this year the catwalk designer felt the sharp edge of the critics' tongues after unveiling a Rihanna-inspired collection for autumn/winter 2013.

Many argued that Ford's elite customer would not want to dress like the provocative singer.

Candid: Usually one to shy away from interviews, Tom Ford has divulged his true feelings about the fashion world in a candid new interview

Talking to WWD about the reaction to his collection, he said: 'Whenever I’m working on a collection, everything does have to be real, and those outfits are real to me.

'And I think, OK, that’s Rihanna, and she’s going to her lawyer’s office in that all-black outfit and she’s hungover and that’s why she’s wearing those glasses. Yet she’s still a rock star.'

51-year-old Ford, who gained international fame for his turnaround of the Gucci fashion house and the creation of his eponymous label, also hit out at high-street giant Zara.

With a little help from the Duchess of Cambridge, Zara have gained plaudits for their on-trend collections, which have led to profits of £1.6bn this year alone.

But Ford revealed that many designers deplore Zara for taking runway looks and selling them instore months before they hit designer rails.

Famous fan: The Duchess of Cambridge has long championed Zara, which helped boost their reputation and sales

'A lot of the things I did - it's not going
to sound anything but egotistical - if I’m lucky and I did the right 
thing, they will be at Zara way before I can get them in the store, and I
don’t like that,' he said.

Ford, who has previously opened up about his internal battle between the inherently materialistic nature of his job and seeking a more simple life, added: 'I’m in a totally different place. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke.

'I’m not the guy who’s designing clothes for someone who is doing lines of coke off the table, like I was when I was at Gucci and Saint Laurent.'

Fathers: Tom Ford, far right, has been in a relationship with Richard Buckley, for 25 years. The two had son Alexander John Buckley Ford in September 2012
