A woman has lost eight stone after photographs of herself at her son's graduation left her mortified.

As a nurse, changing shift patterns, late nights and then a fight against cancer meant Julie Oliver, 48, had let her weight creep up to 18st and was wearing a size 22/24 dress at her largest.

But, after seeing a photo of herself during her son Liam’s graduation and then another snap of herself on holiday in the Canary Islands just a few months later, Julie was shamed into losing the weight for good.

Julie Oliver, 48, was shamed into losing 8 stone after seeing photos of herself at son's graduation - now she is a trim size 8 and weighs 10st

Now Julie, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, is the slimmest she has been since she was 12 years old and, after recently celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary, is the slimmest her husband Pat, 54, has ever known her.

The mother-of-three began putting on weight after her sons Ryan, 27, Liam, 24, and Blaine, 21, were born.

Speaking about her weight gain, Julie said: 'Having three young boys to look after meant I grabbed food whenever I had a free hand. It would either be a block of cheese, half a pack of biscuits, or crisps.'

When Julie started working shifts as a nurse from the age of 28, it was detrimental to her health.

'The night shifts were the worst,' said Julie.

Shamed: Julie was also mortified when she saw photos of herself on holiday and decided it was time to join a slimming club

'All the nurses would bring in biscuits and ready meals and I’d snack constantly through the night. I’d then have breakfast before going home, nibbling on cheese and biscuits. I was eating 24 hours a day.'

By her early forties, Julie’s weight had shot up to 16st 5lb. She had high blood pressure and in 2000 was put on beta blockers. In 2008 Julie’s world fell apart when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Following surgery for a partial mastectomy and to have all of her lymph nodes removed, Julie underwent chemotherapy and was also put on steroids. 

'I ate a lot of comfort food during this time. Because of the side effects of the chemotherapy I suffered a sore painful mouth, so I’d eat soft food such as mashed potato covered in butter and cheese.

'Friends were also keen to take me 
out for lunch two or three times a week. We’d have a cup of tea and a 
slice of cake or calorific cream tea. My weight was soon pushing 17st.'

After
chemotherapy, Julie embarked on a course of radiotherapy and a course 
of Tamoxifen, and was told that one of the side effects was weight gain.
All the medication she was taking caused a lot of joint pain. 

'Suddenly
basic activities like getting out of the chair and climbing the stairs 
were very painful and added to my weight problems; I was so depressed,' 
added Julie.

New lease: 'Since losing the weight I feel like I've now got my whole life ahead of me,' she said

Her biggest fan: She reached her goal weight in June 2012 and her husband loves her new look

So, when she found out that the cancer hadn’t spread and the gruelling treatment was over, whilst she was elated at the news, she no longer recognised herself in the mirror.

At her son Liam’s graduation in October 2010, she felt horrendous. None of her clothes fitted and she opted for a black and yellow dress in a size 24 and a black cardigan to cover herself.

But it was on holiday in Tenerife in March 2011 where Julie reached her lowest point. 

'I had to buy a pair of size 24 shorts, which were the biggest pair I could find, and I felt miserable all holiday,' she said. 'The weather was rubbish, I was 18st and no longer felt like me.

'I was depressed and had a negative 
view of my body. I couldn’t bear to look at myself in the mirror but I 
vowed that having survived breast cancer, and having been through three 
major operations in my quest to overcome it, I wasn’t going to let the 
side effects of all the medication, surgery and treatment rob me of my 
life.'

Instead, on her 
return from her holiday, Julie went along to the joined the Rosemary 
Conley Diet & Fitness Clubs in Welwyn and St Albans, where she lost 
just under a stone in the first month.

Julie
started exercising and soon started attending five classes a week. By 
January 2012, her blood pressure tablets were halved and by May 2012, 
they were stopped altogether.

Indulging: When she met with friends, they would have a cup of tea and a slice of cake or calorific cream tea. Her weight was soon pushing 17st

Who am I ? When she found out that the cancer hadn't spread and the gruelling treatment was over, whilst she was elated at the news, she no longer recognised herself in the mirror

She reached her goal weight in June 2012 and has since lost another half stone – taking her to 10st.

'It’s reassuring to know that I’m a much healthier person. I was at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which runs in my family, but I’ve dramatically reduced my risk, I’ve reduced the risk of cancer returning and now feel more like a 32 year old than someone soon to turn 50. 

'The best compliment so far though has to be when I was out celebrating my anniversary with my husband. I went to the bar to buy some drinks and a man came up to me and said: "Wow, you have the most amazing legs." To which I replied: "That’s what my husband says." His face was a picture.

'Since losing the weight I feel like I’ve now got my whole life ahead of me.

'When I was overweight and diagnosed with cancer, I never thought I’d live to see any of this but now I’m so excited about what lies ahead of me and best of all, I have a new size 8 wardrobe to go with my new lifestyle.'
