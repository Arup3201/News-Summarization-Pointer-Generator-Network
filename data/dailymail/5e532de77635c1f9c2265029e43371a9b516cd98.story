On the run: Snowden has been on the run from U.S. authorities since he laid bare the extent of the NSA's spying programme, particularly on internet communication, such as emails, and social media

Islamic State extremists have studied and exploited the leaks made by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to operate under the radar of U.S. intelligence, a former agency chief has claimed.

Chris Inglis said militants in Iraq and Syria are 'clearly' harder to track down since the rogue agent made freely available a wealth of top-secret information  about how the U.S. government hunts its enemies online.

The terror group, Inglis said, has drastically altered its evasive tradecraft as a result of the data spill, and now operates only in the darkest corners of the internet, where they  remain one step ahead of the intelligence community.

Inglis, who was the National Security Agency's deputy director when Snowden exposed how the NSA eavesdrops, said the leak 'went way beyond disclosing things that bore on privacy concerns', and delved deep into the agency's 'means and methods' used to stay on terrorists' tails.

He told the Washington Times: 'Having disclosed all of those methods, or at least some degree of those methods, it would be impossible to imagine that - as intelligent as they are in the use of technology, in the employment of communications for their own purposes - they wouldn't understand how they might be at risk to intelligence services around the world, not the least of which is the U.S. And they necessarily do what they think is in their best interest to defend themselves.'

Snowden has been on the run from U.S. authorities since he laid bare the extent of the NSA's spying programme, with particular regard to internet communication, such as emails, and social media.

Thanks to the Snowden spill, terror groups have become far more internet savvy, expertly employing the web to disseminate propaganda and communicating only through the most clandestine of channels.

Evil: Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a bin Laden devotee from Iraq, is known to have a sophisticated understanding of online evasive tactics, doubtless improved by Snowden's disclosures

Matthew G. Olsen, who directs the National Counterterrorism Center, agreed, adding: 'Following the disclosure of the stolen NSA documents, terrorists are changing how they communicate to avoid surveillance.

'They are moving to more secure communications platforms, using encryption and avoiding electronic communications altogether

'This is a problem for us in many areas where we have limited human collection and depend on intercepted communications to identify and disrupt plots.'

The Washington Post highlighted one example of how the leaks exposed the types of communications that should be avoided to evade capture.

One of Snowden's disclosures revealed how America caught and killed Osama bin Laden confidant Hassan Ghul in October 2012 after spies intercepted an email from his wife describing his whereabouts.

'In Ghul's case, the agency deployed an arsenal of cyberespionage tools, secretly seizing control of laptops, siphoning audio files and other messages and tracking radio transmissions to determine where Ghul might 'bed down,' The Post wrote.

A Senate defense committee staffer said Thursday: “Our lax security has provided our adversaries with a gold mine of information about our tactics and procedures.”
