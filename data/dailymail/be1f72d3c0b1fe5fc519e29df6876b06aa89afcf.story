A North Dakota news station is facing overwhelming backlash from viewers upset with the firing of a new weekend news anchor who spent his first moments with the station cursing on live TV

A.J. Clemente, formerly of KFYR-TV in Bismarck announced his termination on Monday after he opened Sunday evening's newscast saying 'F****** S***,' making for a shocking and humiliating entrance.

'Rookie mistake. I’m a free agent. Can’t help but laugh at myself and stay positive,' Clemente later wrote on Twitter after being suspended and getting through what he described as a 'tough day.'

Fired: A.J. Clemente, a former weekend news anchor of WFYR-TV in North Dakota, has now been fired after he spent his first moments on the air with the station cursing

Gaffe: KFYR co-anchor A.J. Clemente started his first day on the job by swearing into his microphone, perhaps unaware that it was live

By Tuesday morning more than 1,500 comments for the majority calling the station's reaction overboard responded to an apology posted to the station's Facebook page by its news director, Monica Hannan, on Sunday.

There she offered her 'personal assurance that I will do my best to ensure that nothing like this ever 
happens again under my watch.'

'I think we're all adults and are quite capable of getting over it. It's a non-issue. You don't incorporate profanity in your newscasts, and everyone makes a mistake now and again, so let them off the hook and proceed as normal,' one woman responded to the apology on the Facebook page.

'AJ Clemente made an honest mistake and 
you should give him another chance. Have him give an on-the-air apology 
and move forward. This world has bigger issues than someone accidentally
 cussing on live TV,' another man who identified himself as a managing 
editor for a business journal wrote.

Smile through the pain: His co-anchor, Van Tieu, stumbled through her introduction of her co-worker following his string of profanities

News: Clemente Tweeted the station's decision to let him go while thanking everyone for their support

Others saw opportunity to laugh at 
the situation, including one Facebook user who said 'A.J. Clemente spoke
 from the heart on today's Bismarck newscast.'

10. You’re wearing two neckties

9. Kept mispronouncing your own name

8. Weatherman tells you to expect an 80% chance of unemployment

7. Your tearful, on-air admission of falsifying your resume

6. Referring to Kim Jong Un as Our great and powerful leader

5. No one appreciated your Walter Cronkite impression

4. Last story of the broadcast announced a job opening for a news anchor

3. Received congratulatory phone call from Sue Simmons (Video of former WNBC-TV anchor Sue Simmons: 'What the f*** are you doing!?')

2. Kept dropping your pants and yelling 'This just in!'

1. Aspired to be the next Ernie Anastos (Video of Ernie Anastos: 'Keep f****** that chicken')

Sharing the punch, on Monday night talk-show host David Letterman
 dedicated his Top 10 list to Clemente titled, Top Ten Signs Your First 
Day as a News Anchor Didn't Go Well.

Two included nods to previous profane mistakes made by news anchors on air.

The station has yet to make a public 
statement over his termination while Clemente's former co-anchor Vann 
Tieu Tweeted to his announced firing with her own words of 
encouragement.

'Can't say anything about the decision, but best of luck as you bounce back from this! You will recover buddy!' she wrote.

Tieu appeared momentarily tongue-tied beside Clement at the anchor desk immediately after his audio was picked up.

Clemente also appeared visibly rattled from his gaffe, thanked 
Tieu for the introduction and began talking about his history, saying he
 is a graduate of West Virginia University.

‘I’m used to, you know, from being from the East Coast,’ he stumbled.

The new co-anchor then went into reading about a fatal crash that happened earlier that day.

Clemente later Tweeted that he was trying to 'pronounce the London Marathon winner's name Tsegaye Kebede' of Ethiopia when he slipped up, and contrary to what some accused, 'did not say the word gay.'

Nerves: Clemente expressed some nervousness to his Twitter followers before going on the air on Sunday

Crash and burn: Clemente later gave his followers a less-than cheerful update on how it went, if they missed it on live TV

Tieu later returned on air to issue a public apology for his language by the station.

Following the broadcast, Clemente tweeted: ‘That couldn’t have gone any worse!’

‘I want to apologize for an incident that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening, when one of our employees used profanity on the air,’ Hannan, KFYR-TV wrote in her Facebook apology on Sunday.

‘He did not realize his microphone was on, but still, that's no excuse. We train our reporters to always assume that any microphone is live at any time. Unfortunately, that was not enough in this case. WE can't take back what was said.

Clemente gained national notoriety for his debut from hell on Sunday and KFYRTV fired him less than 24-hours into the job

‘The person involved has been suspended until we resolve the situation. All we can do at this point is ask for your forgiveness, and I can offer my personal assurance that I will do my best to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again under my watch.’

Perhaps the most famous slip-up, however, was from Fox 5 News’ Ernie Anastos, an Emmy-award winning writer. The New York City nightly news anchor playfully told his co-anchor to ‘keep on f****** that chicken.’

The newcast clip became a viral hit, in no small part because of the grimace on his co-anchor Dari Alexander’s face.
