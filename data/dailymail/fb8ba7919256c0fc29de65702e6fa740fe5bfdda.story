Last Picture: Stephen Rakes looks over his shoulder as he leaves the courthouse after attending the trial

The Boston liquor store owner mysteriously found dead days after he was relieved from testifying against alleged mob boss, Whitey Bulger, WAS murdered, MailOnine can reveal.

Toxicology results show that Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes was poisoned with potassium cynanide . The substance was delivered to the unfortunate Mr Rakes in an iced coffee.

But in a bizarre twist his death was unrelated to the high profile trial currently gripping Boston and beyond.

William Camuti, 69, from Sudbury, MA has been charged with attempted murder, misleading police and unlawful disposition of human remains and was arraigned in court this afternoon.

MailOnline first reported that Mr Rakes's death was murder as his long term friend Mr Davis revealed: 'He was poisoned with cyanide.'

Today District Attorney Marian T Ryan confirmed Camuti's arrest. She said: 'We allege this defendant intentionally put poison in the victim's iced coffee and then disposed of his body.'

Camuti and Mr Rakes had known each other for several years and Mr Rakes is understood to have owed Camuti a considerable sum of money.

Boston authorities believe that Camuti acted alone and lured Mr Rakes into a meeting at McDonald's in Waltham, MA on the day of his death to discuss a potential investment property. According to investigators no such property existed.

Once there, Camuti allegedly bought both men iced coffees and laced Mr Rakes's beverage with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide. They believe he then drove the dying man around for a couple of hours to ensure the poison took full effect before abandoning the body in woods in Lincoln, MA.

According to Mr Davis the Bulger trial offered  'the perfect opportunity' to commit the crime and 'have a cover story...already in place.'

Mr Rakes's death was originally ruled as a suicide. But long term friend Steve Davis, whose sister was allegedly murdered by Bulger and his right-hand man, Stephen 'the Rifleman' Flemmi, maintained from the start that his friend was a victim of foul play.

The revelations come the day Bulger said he would not give testimony in his trial. In an angry tirade in which the alleged gangster told the court 'do what you want with me' and branded the proceedings a 'sham.'

Rakes openly despised Bulger, the former 
crime boss who headed Boston's notorious Winter Hill Gang, and was ready
to testify that he threatened his daughter at gunpoint to force him
to turn over his liquor store for $100,000 so that he 
could make it his mob's new headquarters.

Mr
Rakes was laid to rest at a small funeral last week. Around 100 
mourners attended the brief ceremony at the Gate of Heaven Church in 
south Boston.

Speaking at the time, Raymond Muise of Dorchester told the Boston Herald: 'He was one of the best. There’s something wrong. It’s strange what happened to him.

'He lived for his family. He was very good to myself and the rest of the people around him, and 
he worked hard all his life.'

After his suspicious death, friend Steven Davis made no secret of his view that his friend had been murdered: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket.

'Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now.'

Davis said the first indication of anything amiss with Rakes was on Wednesday 17 July, the afternoon he was removed from the witness list of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz at the U.S. District Court in South Boston.

The 59-year-old's death came just weeks after Rake revealed he was no longer scared of the gangster and that he was grateful to be alive to testify.

'They took everything from me,' he said of the mob. 'They don't care about nothing. They don't care about what they take from you... At least I’m still alive. I’m alive and I’m grateful for that.'

Rakes, who had previously refused to testify against Bulger, had told Davis that he was 'nervous' about the 'bombshell' he thought he was going to drop on the stand at the feared mobster's trial.

'He was looking forward to taking the stand. He told me over and over he had a big bombshell to drop,' said Davis.

However,
he was robbed of this chance when U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz
informed Rakes that he was no longer needed as a witness - a decision 
that reportedly 'devastated' him.

Rakes
had harbored decades of anger at Bulger and his accomplices, Stephen 
'The Rifleman' Flemmi and Kevin Weeks, after they allegedly forced him 
to hand over his South Boston liquor store in 1984 by holding a gun to 
his daughter's head.

'The day I see him in a box, not breathing, will be better,' Rakes said in April.

Steven Davis told NBC: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket. Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now'

Indeed, Rakes had been a constant presence at Bulger's trial at the US District Court in South Boston.

Attending
every day for the past six weeks, the trial began after the notorious 
gangster was captured in California two years ago after 16 years on the 
run from authorities.

Davis 
told ABC News that the last time he saw Rakes was in court the day before his death
but he failed to reach him during the night and alarms bells started 
ringing when he didn't meet him for breakfast on Wednesday as usual.

'Stippo would not kill himself. Absolutely not,' said Davis.

Davis said that his friend was 'in good shape' and the two of them would frequently cycle across Boston.

'He had everything to live for and was looking forward to his day in court. It doesn't make sense.'
