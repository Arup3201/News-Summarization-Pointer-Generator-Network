Eifion Howatson, 41, had pleaded guilty to demanding £5,000 with menaces from the unnamed men. One is a well-known sportsman

A paramedic commended on four occasions was last night starting a ten-month jail term for blackmailing two married men when he discovered their sexual relationships with his partner.

Eifion Howatson, 41, of Ruthin, North Wales, had pleaded guilty to demanding £5,000 with menaces from the unnamed men, known by their initials when the two charges were outlined. One is a well-known sportsman.

Judge David Hale told him: 'No-one must think they can make threats of this nature to anybody because it does cause such enormous upset to those affected.'

Caernarfon Crown Court heard that Howatson, who had ended his own marriage, had later become involved with another woman.

The judge told him: 'It's apparent you invested more in that relationship than she did.

'When you discovered in June from her mobile phone that she was having affairs you decided to take a remarkable course of action in that you blackmailed these two lovers, seeking £5,000 from each of them.

'They were married family men who probably therefore shouldn't have been involved with your partner when they had been.'

One of the victims went to the police. Judge Hale added: 'They spent 40 hours in emotional turmoil.'

Prosecuting counsel Wyn Lloyd Jones said Howatson had sent texts and threatened to expose the relationships but no money was handed over.

Defence barrister Simon Killeen said Howatson qualified as a paramedic in 1999 but his professional body had indicated they would have to consider his registration.

Mr Killeen said the father-of-two had felt the guilt of the impact of ending his marriage 'extremely keenly' and became depressed. In February he was on light duties but it was 'devastating' to him when he discovered his partner's relationships.

'It wasn't simply the fact he discovered she had been having a relationship behind his back but a second relationship, and then the material he found on her phone is relevant to his state of mind,' counsel said.

'We are talking about very serious conduct on his part over 40 hours following the reading of that material and realising everything he thought was in place for him to move forward was all suddenly gone.' He wasn't in his right mind.'

The barrister remarked: 'The consequences are he's lost his good character and his employment.'

Howatson had been commended four times for his 'outstanding' work and was an 'exemplary' member of the community. He had been a referee and did voluntary and charity work, his defence counsel added.

The blackmail victims cannot be identified because of a court order.
