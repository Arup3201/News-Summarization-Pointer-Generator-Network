A young boy has narrowly missed being hit by two cars after he dashed out onto a busy Singapore street.

The toddler was captured on a dashboard camera running straight into oncoming traffic on Bedok North Road at 8.50pm last Friday.

The driver who recorded the ordeal can be heard shouting when the small boy suddenly appears in front of his car.

Mad dash: A toddler was nearly hit by two vehicles when he ran out onto a busy road in Singapore on Friday

He braked just in time before honking his horn several times.

The driver shouted when the little boy failed to stop and almost got collected by a taxi in the next lane.

The toddler seemed unfazed by his near miss. 

He turned around momentarily in front of the taxi as a woman dashed into the camera frame with her handbag under her arm.

But he raced off again and only stopped when the woman caught up with him on the other side of the road.

The one-minute video was uploaded to streetdirectory.com's Facebook page on Tuesday.

Many who watched the video praised the driver for his quick reflexes but also condemned the woman for not keeping the toddler close as they crossed the road.

'The driver was very quick to see this child in a split second. Able to avoid the child and at the same the car behind him. The praise should be given to the driver who was alert and vigilant. It could happen to any body and not to specific people. Life is precious,' Margisvaran Chris posted.

Wendy Cheng said: 'Parents must always hold their hands. Even till now, my boy is 11, as a mother, I will never let go this hand when crossing the road'.

61 children aged under 12 have been casualties in road accidents this year in Singapore – a 15 percent increase from last year, according to Yahoo! Singapore.
