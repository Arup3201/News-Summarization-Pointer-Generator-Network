Money doesn't just fall out of the sky - except for residents of Lewes, Delaware, who had $10,000 showered over them from above on Saturday afternoon.

A helicopter appeared in the sky over the Lewes Harbor, according to the Cape Gazette, and hovered there for five minutes divesting itself of the cash, then flew off.

The windfall came courtesy of Leonard Maull, who owned a bait and tackle shop in the town before his death last year.

Make it rain: Leonard Maull stipulated that $10,000 be showered over the town of Lewes where he lived and worked on the first anniversary of his death

Maull left specific instructions in his 
will for $10,000 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 notes to be dropped from an 
aircraft over the Lewes Marina on the first anniversary of his death.

Staff at the Irish Eyes pub were working their Saturday afternoon shift when they noticed the helicopter approaching.

Server Tina Chaippini told the Cape Gazette that people were running towards the helicopter and returning with fistfuls of money.

Another stafff member, Billy Anderson, said he suddenly noticed customers pointing at the sky. 

'I’m hearing, "Crash, crash."  What they’re saying is, "Cash, cash,"' he said.

According to the Cape Gazette, local police were aware of the plan and sent an officer to the marina to ensure nothing got out of hand - but there was no need.

'Nobody was, like, fighting with each other for it, but everyone was just scrambling trying to grab everything they could,' said Irish Eyes manager Kara Miele, who scooped up $170.

'This is probably one of the most exciting things that ever happened here, I would assume,' she said.

The man behind the money, Leonard Maull, owned Henlopen Bait and Tackle in the town and visited the marina at least once a day .

Maull's trustee, certified public accountant Bill Berry, told the Cape Gazette that Maull left the request in his trust.

'It was his money, and I figured he could do what he wanted to do with it,' Berry said.

A friend of Maull, James Walsh, told the Gazette that he doesn't know why Maull chose to have his money dropped over the town.

'I would’ve never thought Leonard would do anything like this,' he said.

But do something like that he did, as the people of Lewes can testify.

Mark Tappan, a runner at Irish Eyes, said: 'I was eating chicken wings and watching money fall from the clouds.'
