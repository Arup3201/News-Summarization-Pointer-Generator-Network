This is the moment a holidaymaker risks his life by bear hugging a shark in what has been branded an idiotic stunt.

The snorkeller is filmed wrapping his arms around the lemon shark so his face is just inches away from its jaws.

Lemon sharks, named after their yellow colour, are not normally aggressive to humans but they have been known to attack if they feel threatened and one seriously injured a scuba diver earlier this year.

Luckily, this shark remain remarkably docile as the swimmer approaches the 8ft animal from behind, swings himself underneath and rides along for several metres.

The man who posted the video on YouTube, Grant Murdok, said the lemon shark swam peacefully among a group of snorkellers in the waters off the Pacific island of Bora Bora.

Mr Murdoch, who said he also embraced one of the sharks, said: 'They didn't seem to mind at all that we were riding for free. It was as close to an out of body experience that I have ever felt.'

But the close encounters have been labelled dumb, idiotic and crazy on social media, it was reported by ninemsn.

Sandra O'Donovan posted on Facebook: 'It'll be all fun and games until one of the sharks... bites someone and gets killed for its trouble.'

Another, Will Bateman, said: 'Good way to lose your face'.

In February this year, a Canadian tourist was seriously injured when a lemon shark bit him on the forearm while he was scuba diving off Bora Bora.
