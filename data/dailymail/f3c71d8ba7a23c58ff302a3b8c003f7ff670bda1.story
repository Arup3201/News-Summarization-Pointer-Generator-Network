Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is confident significant funds will be available to strengthen his squad.

Pardew left Newcastle to take over at Selhurst Park last week and is now tasked with securing safety for the Eagles, who are currently 18th in the Barclays Premier League.

Palace are eager to boost their attacking options before the transfer window closes on February 2, and chairman Steve Parish is reportedly ready to sanction a club-record offer for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis.

'Is that the kind of backing I'd hope for? Of course,' Pardew said.

'I can't say anything about the financial side - I think that's unfair on any club we're talking to.

'But the chairman and the board are keen to try to bring a player or two and I know they're working hard towards that.

'We have to wait and see, it's complicated securing any player and particularly a striker.'

Pardew added: 'I spoke to Steve on my arrival here, after the club initiated the transfer.

'I told him we're going to need some funding because we need to get new players and he gave me the assurances that he would do his very, very best to do that.'

Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has impressed during the first half of the season but Pardew insists it would take an 'extraordinary' offer for the 25-year-old to be sold.

'Like with any player you can never say never, and I learned that at Newcastle, losing Andy Carroll on the last day of the window,' Pardew said.

'So never say never but I think it would take an extraordinary bid to take him away from this football club in the situation we are in.

'I would be very surprised if any club wanted to make that phone call.'

Pardew's first league game in charge on Saturday sees the Eagles host Tottenham, who will be in confident mood after a superb 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year's Day.

'It's important when you're fighting relegation you don't hit teams in red hot form and Tottenham are, so it's not the greatest of starts,' Pardew said.

'They were terrific against Chelsea. The fact the Europa League campaign has closed down has helped them because that's a huge factor, which we suffered with at Newcastle.

'This is a great period for them and we're going to have to try to knock them out of their stride.'

Pardew added: 'What I do know is from the welcome I've had, the place will be jumping for us and we need to exploit that.'
