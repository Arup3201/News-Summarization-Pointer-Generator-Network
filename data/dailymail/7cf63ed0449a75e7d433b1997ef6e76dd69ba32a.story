Just as it looked like Alvaro Negredo's luck was turning, disaster struck. 'The Beast' brilliantly created Scott Sinclair's opener against Hearts but minutes later he was leaving the field with a limp.

And it looked as if things were to get worse for City when Osman Sow equalised in the second half for the recently relegated Edinburgh side - before Aleksandar Kolarov's penalty 10 minutes from time gave the Blues their first win of their Scottish pre season tour.

Negredo made a blistering start to his City career last season before fading away at the end of the campaign - and while fans will have been delighted to see him play a brilliant eye-of-the-needle assist for Sinclair to score, his early exit could be a worry with less than a month until the start of the season.

Manuel Pellegrini played different teams
 in each half as the Premier League champions looked to build up their 
fitness ahead of a tough defence of their title.

Summer signings Fernando and Willy Caballero both made their second appearances of the summer as half time substitutes on a night when City's stars who did not travel to the World Cup enjoyed a run out.

Hearts engineered the first real opening after 19 minutes when Jamie Walker threaded a pass through to Dale Carrick in the box but the striker's left-footed strike from a tight angle was repelled by goalkeeper Richard Wright.

City were not so forgiving in the final third and Pellegrini's side went ahead after 25 minutes.

Negredo
 found Sinclair in the box and the midfielder kept his calm amid shouts 
for offside to cooly roll the ball pass Alexander from close range.

Power: Alex Kolarov converts the penalty with 10 minutes left to give Manchester City the win at Hearts

Captain Kolarov: The Serbian left back converted from the spot to give City their first pre season win

Touch of class: Negredo watches on as his through ball is converted by Scott Sinclair

Back on form: Scott Sinclair had earlier given City the lead after a brilliant through ball from Negredo

With the exception of the goal scorer, City named a completely different line-up after the break.

And Hearts levelled after 56 minutes when Sow raced on to Carrick's pass before calmly lifting the ball past Willy Caballero.

City were awarded a penalty with ten minutes left when Callum Paterson brought down Emyr Huws after taking a bad first touch.

Kolarov - roundly booed after criticising Paterson for a challenge on keeper Caballero - silenced the home crowd with a clinical low finish.

Worry: Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping that Negredo's injury is not serious ahead of the new season
