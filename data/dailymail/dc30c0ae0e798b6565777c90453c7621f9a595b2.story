Cristiano Ronaldo has declared himself fit for Portugal’s Group G opener against Germany – and told sceptics who believe he needs a good World Cup to look at his CV.

The Real Madrid forward has been struggling with a knee problem in the build up to Monday night's heavyweight clash in Salvador, but said on Sunday: ‘Obviously I would like to be at 110 per cent - I am 100 per cent and that is enough to help the national team.

‘I have been practising for many days and I am feeling well. There has not been a single moment when I have not played without pain in my career, that’s the burden.’

The issue of Ronaldo’s fitness has come to the forefront with the forward photographed with an ice pack on his knee this week, raising fears that he might again fail to produce his best form on the game’s biggest stage.

The subject of his legacy was again raised on Sunday, with Ronaldo adamant that he has nothing to prove.

He said: ‘I don’t think I have to show anyone anything. Look at my statistics and CV – I have no words for that question. I have nothing to prove. My career has been great so far and I just want to continue.’

Ronaldo added: ‘I believe one player is not a team. I am here to help the team. I am an additional player and I can make a difference, but I can’t carry the team on my back.

‘I want to be champion, but let’s take it a step at a time. We played a great team tomorrow, but we have our weapons. We are not in the group of favourites, but we are one of the best.

‘For me it pushes me forward to succeed at a tournament. I like challenges, I want to do my best in whatever competition I am in.

‘It is a new challenge which I will face up to. I want to show my football, it is my life and something want to do most.

‘We start the competition waiting to do our best. Germany is a very strong team, but we don’t have to respect or fear that.

‘We have many good players and I believe we will have a good World Cup.’

Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer believes the fixture is ‘almost like a final’.

The Germans have been handed a tricky start in a group which also includes Ghana and the USA and Neuer said: ‘After that match, we will really know where we stand. In a way, it’s almost like a final.’
