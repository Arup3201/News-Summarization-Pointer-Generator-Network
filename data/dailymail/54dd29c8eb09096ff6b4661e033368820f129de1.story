If you've ever wondered what's going on inside your child's mind when they're scribbling a story - and if they're writing the same sort of creative tales as their peers - you might be about to find out.

A children's writing competition run by BBC Radio 2 for youngsters up to the age of 13 has revealed some of the literary habits of British children - and they include lots of heroes called Jack and Lucy, a penchant for writing more about mothers than fathers, a fondness for the London Olympic Games, girls using more similes than boys and an overall leaning towards dogs rather than cats.

The young winners of the 500 Words competition, launched by Chris Evans on his breakfast show in 2011, were announced at today's Hay Festival. Meanwhile he Oxford University Press has been running all 90,000 entries (that's 40 million words) through a database to pull out interesting trends.

The most popular names for characters were Jack and Lucy, and the most frequently used two-word nouns were time machine, space ship and tree house

The most common word written was 'mum' and its variations, with a total of 115,627 mentions, according to the BBC. 'Dad', meanwhile, just made the top 15 most common words, boasting only half the mentions of 'mum'.

Dogs were more popular additions to stories than monsters, vampires or dragons, with the word 'dog' cropping up 25,000 times in the tales.

Jamaica's Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt and England footballer Wayne Rooney, meanwhile, were the athletes with the most mentions. Other Olympians who performed in London in 2012 - such as Tom Daley and Jessica Ennis - also featured prominently in many of the short stories.

Girls used more similes than boys, while boys described cars in much more vivid detail. And popular new 'slang' words included 'totes', 'yolo' (you only live once), 'amazeballs' and 'rofl' (rolling on the floor laughing).

Fantastical, made-up words proved popular, with children inventing words such as fabdabidabulous and creatures such as the lumbagain (a ghost who makes people
dull and boring, obviously) and the dulbodogfragonaffe (a very big animal with the 
head of a duck and the mane of a lion, plus the neck of a giraffe and 
the body of a horse).

There were also gadgets such as the shrinkinganator and places 
like Mirangodangowangolopitis.

The longest word - 36 
letters - was hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. A genuinely real word that means fear of long words.

CBBC and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond, award-winning novelist and screen writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce, along with leading authors Dame Jaqueline Wilson, Charlie Higson and Malorie Blackman judged the competition.

They picked their favourite six stories, drawn from two age groups: children aged 9 and under, and those aged between 10 and 13.

Chris Evans said: 'Best 500 Words so far. Absolutely stellar. The stories always really come alive on the day of the final and this year was off the charts.

'I was staggered to find out we'd 
received over 90,000 entries for this year's competition.

The 
creativity of these awesome authors knows no bounds - we have dragons, 
monsters, wizards, space-ships - and some of these super story-tellers 
are even inventing new words. Inspirational or what?

'The reaction from listeners following the broadcast this morning at Hay has been unprecedented. Can't wait for next year. Year four, bring it on.'

Vineeta Gupta, Head of Children's Dictionaries at Oxford University Press said: '500 Words has given children across the UK a wonderful opportunity to use their language skills to create fabulous and evocative stories.

'The Oxford University Press use powerful technology and, together with teams of language experts, track and analyse children's language, and the message we are getting from the BBC's 500 WORDS is very clear - language is evolving, and children are real language innovators.

'This research will help us shine a light on our children's language research in the future.'
