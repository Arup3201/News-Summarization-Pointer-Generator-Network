Labour leader Ed Miliband was coached by Bourne Supremacy film director Paul Greengrass to improve his performance in front of the camera, it has emerged.

The 43-year-old politician, who is known for his nasal voice and somewhat uncharismatic delivery, reportedly had lessons in how to act in front of an audience for 'months' before he delivered his speech at the Labour party conference in Brighton on Tuesday.

Greengrass, 58, directed Matt Damon who played a spy struggling to discover who he was in the Bourne Identity sequels The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum.

He was reportedly drafted in to help the leader of the opposition practise speaking in front of an audience before his big appearance at Brighton.

Greengrass has known Miliband since the 1990s when they both worked in television together and has coached him before - in 2011 the pair had meetings to discuss tactics on how Miliband might achieve political supremacy.

Those who listened to Miliband's speech earlier this week noticed a change in manner for the usually nerdish politician.  He seemed more confident, articulate, and happy to gesticulate as he spoke of his vision for the future.

The Labour Party press office did not return MailOnline's request for a comment today.

Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a CIA agent suffering from extreme memory loss who is struggling to find out who he is in the Bourne films.

The first film in the series, The Bourne Identity, came out in 2002, followed by The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), both of which were directed by British director Greengrass.

The fourth and most recent film in the series, The Bourne Legacy, co-written and directed by Tony Gilroy, came out last year but Matt Damon chose not to act in the film.

Damon, who like Miliband was told how to act in front of a camera, plays Jason Bourne, a man who is not sure of his own identity, in the Bourne films
