Arsene Wenger has hit back at Paul Scholes following the former England midfielder’s criticism of Mesut Ozil.

Manchester United legend Scholes has accused the £42.5million man of ‘going through the motions’ during his time with the Gunners in comments made to a national newspaper.

But the Arsenal manager has defended his record signing, saying: ‘It’s a wrong statement. He works very hard and he’s a great player. A player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Ozil. Mesut has a point to prove and he knows that.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has leaped to Ozil's defence by hitting back at former United ace Scholes 

‘I believe he has the quality, he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows.

‘You can be cheated a little bit by his style of play, because he is fluid, easy, subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in, but he does.’

Meanwhile, Wenger has launched a staunch defence of summer signing Danny Welbeck as the forward prepares for his Manchester United return. After arriving at the Emirates Stadium intent on playing as a central striker, the England international has found himself playing out wide again, a position he found frustrating during his time at Old Trafford.

He has scored seven goals since arriving from United in August — three of those coming in a Champions League win over Galatasaray.

But ahead of Monday’s FA Cup quarter-final, Wenger insists Welbeck has not been a £16million flop.

‘He’s very important and has played many games since the start of the season,’ said Wenger — who confirmed central defender Gabriel will miss up to three weeks with a hamstring injury.

‘If you check the statistics you will see (the suggestion Welbeck doesn’t play often) is wrong. He’s one of the players who has played the most games for us, but not in the last couple of games.

Wenger also spoke to Sportsmail’s Martin Keown in an interview for the BBC’s Football Focus, to be broadcast on Saturday. In it, the Arsenal manager, who has won the FA Cup five times, discussed his favourite memories of the competition and which of the wins meant most to him.

Wenger said: ‘Maybe the first one against Newcastle was the best because it was when we won the double in 1998. I remember absolutely everything about that day because it was at Wembley. When I was a kid in France I saw the cup finals. For me to come from a little village and go for the first time to Wembley was something special. It was a great old stadium, the soul was there, the grass was special.’ 

Scholes believes the likes of Manchester United's Robin van Persie left Arsenal because they were ambitious 

The likes of Cesc Fabregas and Thierry Henry also left Arsenal to add to their personal trophy collection 

But when asked about his collection of medals, Wenger admitted he cared little for them. He said: ‘I don’t even know where they are. Maybe I will regret it. I would like to think I get more out of the human side of my career.

‘I prefer to have a box of memories than a box of medals. What is interesting is that you can have an influence on people’s lives. They can have a big influence on you as well.’

Arsenal face United on Monday and Wenger enjoyed many classic cup ties against Sir Alex Ferguson’s side, but he said the pair’s frosty relationship had thawed in recent years.

‘I am happy to see him now,’ said Wenger, ‘more than before because we have gone through some different periods. In the end it became more respectful and of course he was not always objective in defending his team. Nor was I! That created disagreements.

‘Now we are happy to have dinner together and a good glass of wine and rise above the differences.’

But Monday’s tie doesn’t please him. ‘I wanted to play at home. But fantastic game or not, what is important is that you go through. It would have been better at home. Now it is what it is, you want to qualify for the semi-final.’
