She's famous for her down-to-earth approach and as these pictures reveal, that even extends to getting her caffeine fix.

As the Gatcombe Horse Trials got underway, the Princess Royal was spotted mingling with the crowds before stopping to pick up a coffee - and a side-order of friendly chat.

Dressed in one of her trademark hats, the 64-year-old royal looked on cheerful form as she chatted away to stall holders.

Later, she was seen clutching a pretty bunch of pink roses given to her by a well-wisher as she toured the equestrian event, which are being held on her Gatcombe Park Estate, and watched the action unfold.

Although no longer riding competitively herself, the Princess Royal is famous for her love of all things equestrian - a trait passed down to her Olympic silver medal winning daughter Zara.

She has also spoken out about the ill-treatment of horses in the UK, even, at one point, controversially calling for people to eat horse meat in a bid to ensure that the animals always have a value and are never abandoned by their owners.

The princess, of whom the Duke of Edinburgh once famously said 'If it doesn’t fart or eat hay, she isn’t interested', also owns several horses of her own, including a rescue pony.

Annie the Welsh Cob had been badly neglected before being taken in by World Horse Welfare four years ago and was later given a fairytale ending when she was adopted by the royal.

Now living on the Gatcombe Park Estate, the 15-year-old mare spends her days roaming the property with Princess Anne on board.

Speaking after the adoption last year, the Princess Royal explained: 'She's perfect for me. She's not wanting to be too ambitious and I don't want to be very ambitious either.

Anne, who is the patron of World Horse Welfare which currently has 7,000 horses looking for homes, added: 'She fits in really well and as far as I'm concerned I was really glad they didn't find someone else for her. She is just the size of horse that I could do with now.

'Living here and going across the farm I like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was reasonably reliable when it come to rural activities.

'I hope Annie enjoys it here with me. We will be doing some hacking and she will be helping me herd the sheep and cattle.

'Rehoming from a charity may be the best way of finding a horse because you know so much more about the animal you are getting.'

Anne, who shares the Gatcombe Park Estate with Zara and son Peter Phillips, has also been an enthusiastic supporter of her daughter's eventing career.

Zara, who also put in an appearance during Prince Harry's Invictus Games during a wheelchair rugby match, is one of the UK's most successful eventing stars and is likely to feature in the Olympic team at Rio 2016.
