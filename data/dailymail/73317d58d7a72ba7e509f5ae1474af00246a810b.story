Newcastle United are watching Malaga's highly-rated forward Juanmi.

The 21 year-old earned a first call-up to the Spain squad last week as a replacement for injured Chelsea striker Diego Costa and is due to play against Holland on Tuesday.

Juanmi came through Malaga's youth ranks and is the club's youngest goalscorer after scoring on his debut against Getafe in a Copa del Rey match at just 16 in 2010.

Juanmi (11) is being watched by Newcastle and could be set for a move to England in the summer window

Newcastle have had success with former Tenerife striker Ayoze Perez who is attracting interest from other Premier League sides already and are exploring the Spanish market again to see if they can pick a bargain.

Juanmi can play on either wing or as a second striker and is contracted to Malaga until 2018.
