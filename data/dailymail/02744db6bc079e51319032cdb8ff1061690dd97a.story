Dan Harris: The cyclist was described as having a 'warmth and passion for life'

A cyclist killed by an Olympic bus took to the roads only because he feared the Games would cause public transport chaos.

Dan Harris, 28, was dragged under the wheels of a double-decker at a notorious junction in the shadow of the velodrome at the Olympic Park.

The internet consultant began commuting on his racing bike a week earlier after telling friends he was fed up with delayed trains.

He was the tenth cyclist to die in the capital this year despite millions of pounds being ploughed into making the roads safer.

The tragedy came just hours after Bradley Wiggins raced to victory and said he hoped his achievement would encourage more to take up the sport.

But after learning of the death, the gold medallist reignited the debate over the safety of cycling in cities. He said the Government should make helmets compulsory and road users should ‘give and take’.

He added: ‘London is a busy city and there’s a lot of traffic. It’s got a lot busier since I was riding a bike as a kid round here, and I got knocked off several times.’

Yesterday an emotional account emerged from a fellow cyclist who was riding alongside Mr Harris, seconds before he was dragged under the bus in Hackney, close to the Olympic Park Velodrome.

The eyewitness, who has not revealed their name, posted a message on the Reddit community blog detailing the tragic moment they saw the accident.

The post read: 'The lights changed as he was in the buses blind spot and as he was attempting to go straight the bus turned left. He didn't really have anywhere to go and no time to do anything anyway.'

'Make helmets compulsory': Bradley Wiggins calls for an overhaul of road safety laws after a cyclist was killed by an Olympics coach close to the Velodrome just hours after he won gold in the time trials yesterday

Shocking: The accident occurred outside the Olympic Park, in Hackney, close to the Games' Velodrome, hockey pitch and Paralympics' tennis arena, as foreign journalists were being transported to another venue

The death toll for cyclists killed in the UK is at least 60 after the death of the 28-year-old man last night.

11 of these occured last month. Among them was Kyle Coen, 14, who was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Kent on Monday when he was cycling to meet his girlfriend.

Another teenager was killed last week. Kadian Harding, 14, was hit by a Mercedes Sprinter van when on a family bike ride in Marlborough.

Kadian was pronounced dead at the scene after failed attempts from paramedics and his family to rescue him.

An inquest was opened on Friday into the teenager's death. No arrest was made of the 32-year-old driver, who suffered from severe shock.

Last year 16 cyclists lost their lives in London, and - including the man who was killed yesterday - ten have died on the capital's roads this year.

Daniel Cox was hit by a lorry in Dalston, and died at the Royal London Hospital.

The message continues: 'As soon as the
 bus was definitely stopped i crawled under to him from the other side 
and i was immediately aware that i didn't think he'd make it.'

The
 poster then describes how they crawled up to the collision victim and 
comforted him, adding: 'I asked him his name and told him he was going 
to be alright. He didn't say anything because i don't think he could, 
but he looked straight at me.

'I
 did my best to look him straight in the eyes and tell him he was going 
to be ok. He was so afraid. Maybe half a minute later i could tell he'd 
passed.'

Mr Harris was on 
his way home to Wanstead, East London, when he was crushed by an 
official bus ferrying media around the outskirts of the Olympic Park on 
Wednesday evening.

Another 
cyclist rushed to his aid, but the IT worker, who had recently moved in 
with his long-term girlfriend, died at the scene.

Campaigners
 said the junction on the A12, in Stratford, was ‘badly designed’ and 
criticised the closure of a safer canal towpath during the Games for 
‘security reasons’. The bus driver, a 65-year-old man, was arrested and 
questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving before 
being released on bail.

Mr 
Harris’s Italian girlfriend, advertising worker Cecilia Dominici, was 
too upset to speak as she was comforted by friends yesterday.

She posted a picture of herself with her boyfriend online with the words: ‘More than anything in this world.’

Damaged: The man's bike lies mangled next to the Olympic bus which hi collided with

Tragedy: An officer stands watch near the scene of the crash, which happened as Wiggins was preparing to speak at a press conference at the Olympic Park

Safety call: Wiggins said the Government should be 'legalising helmets to make them the law to wear' as he he admitted he had been knocked off his bike on London¿s 'dangerous' streets

Mr
 Harris’s employer, Moo.com, said: ‘There are no words to express how 
much we’ll all miss him, and his infectious enthusiasm, warmth and 
passion for life.’

It is 
not known if Mr Harris was wearing a helmet, but last night David 
Cameron said making them compulsory was under review. He said: ‘It’s a 
difficult issue.

'There is a strong case for making them compulsory but 
when this was last looked at the decision was made not to do that 
because there are some who take a different view, that it would 
discourage cycling and it wouldn’t reduce the level of accidents.’
