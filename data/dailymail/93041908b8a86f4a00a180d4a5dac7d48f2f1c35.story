The step-mother of Simon Cowell's pregnant, married lover has called the news of her shock pregnancy 'beautiful' and a 'blessing'.

While the X Factor guru's representatives refused to confirm the pregnancy, Rosy Davis,  who is married to Lauren Silverman's father Steven, said: 'We are all excited for the baby.'

Speaking from her Florida home, Mrs Davis added: 'Any kid is a blessing.'

Mrs Davis spoke out as MailOnline confirmed on Thursday that Lauren's husband Andrew Silverman - a close friend of Cowell's - has filed for divorce from his estranged wife, who has fled their multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment.

Papers were filed on July 15 - and according to US Weekly magazine, Lauren is 10 weeks pregnant - making it clear she was expecting before he made a bid to end their marriage.

Good spirits: The property magnate was smiling as he left his New York apartment on Wednesday evening, in spite of hitting headlines the world over after it was revealed his wife was having Simon Cowell's baby

Rushing out of his Park Avenue office in
 Manhattan tonight at 6.10pm, Mr Silverman shielded his face before 
jumping into a waiting car - without making any comment.

He is being represented by Manhattan family lawyers Cohen Goldstein, while Lauren’s attorney is marked as unknown.

The couple have been married for 10 years and have a seven-year-old son called Adam.

Cowell, 53, and Lauren, 36, are believed to have met while on vacation in Barbados some years ago through Mr Silverman.

A friend of Lauren's told of 
MailOnline: 'Lauren loves Simon, she says that she wants to marry him. 
And with the baby, she's going the right way about it! But I think this 
could be really good for Simon.'

Today, a source claimed there had 
been issues in the Silvermans' marriage right from the start – claiming 
that Mr Silverman’s parents Eleonora and Allen never attended their 
wedding.

A source said: 
‘Andrew’s parents boycotted their wedding because they had their doubts 
about Lauren, she thought she was suspect.’

Andrew now believes Lauren started cheating on him with Simon during one of the many vacations they all shared together.

The
 pal added:‘They would organise these month-long trips and Andrew would 
go for two weeks and then leave for business and Lauren would stay 
behind.

‘And people talked when she left their little boy at home and stayed away for a month.’

The couple and their son have been living in a stunning apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a ‘white glove condominium’ aptly named The Savoy since 2000.

The condo was actually bought by Andrew’s father, Allen, for $1,213,500 (£800k) in 1999 and remains in his name. The property, will, of course, now be worth considerably more.

The building boasts a doorman, concierge, valet service, health club and a sundeck overlooking Manhattan – with superstore Bloomingdales just a block away.

Andrew works alongside his father Allen, who founded property company The Andalex Group by combining his sons names, Andrew and Alexander, in the 1980s.

The family own a string of Manhattan apartments as well as a $4.5million (£3m) country home in Stamford, Connecticut.

The Silvermans have been firm fixtures on the New York social scene for many years and as they became firmly ensconced in Simon Cowell’s camp of close friends, Lauren became especially friendly with New York designer Rachel Roy.

Friends before lovers: X Factor Svengali Cowell and Lauren Silverman met through her husband Andrew, a good friend of the star

The irony is such that stunning Rachel, 39,  was forced to deny that she was dating Cowell after posting pictures from aboard his yacht during a New Year jaunt around the Caribbean in January, with her spokeswoman telling Page Six at the time: ‘She is on vacation with Simon. They are just friends.’

The high-profile couple never made a secret of their friendship with Cowell and indeed when questions were constantly asked about the exact nature of Lauren’s friendship with the X Factor svengali, the reply would always be the same – an insistence that they were just close friends, and that Lauren was merely the wife of one of Cowell’s best friends.

The couple were even mentioned in Tom Bower’s 2012 tell-all book on Cowell, Sweet Life:The Intimate Life Of Simon Cowell.

Interestingly, Lauren handed over a picture to be published in the tome, taken on a New Year 2012 vacation on board the Slipstream yacht in St Barts.

She hovers in a hot pink sundress above Cowell, while he sits next to his ex-fiancee Mezhgan Husseiny, whose enticing curves are on show in a bikini.

Her husband Andrew beams up at the camera, sitting at the end of the group, which features Cowell’s best friend Sinitta.

Fast forward a few months and Lauren turned up to the book launch at London’s Serpentine Gallery in April, smiling sweetly for the cameras – joining Cowell as he took Bower and friends to the trendy Arts Club for dinner and drinks after the bash, where he joked: ‘“Being invited here was rather like a cat inviting a mouse to a dinner party.’

The book ends as Cowell flirts with a ‘feisty’ Brazilian beauty called Ana Paula Junqueira – and invites her back to his yacht in Barbados.

Luxury: Simon Cowell and his friends Lauren and Andrew Silverman enjoyed many vacations on board the Slipstream yacht

Writer Bower reported: ‘At the end of one high-spirited night at the island’s yacht club, fuelled by champagne and vodka, he had invited a group of Brazilian girls onto Slipstream.

‘By 5am, he was intimately embraced with Anna (sic) Paula, a well-known international socialite.

‘At teatime later that day, she had flown back to São Paulo on a private jet and had texted her intentions

‘She’s coming to London soon,’ he announced at dinner. ‘That should be fun.’

And as we know now, that romance was to be extremely short lived …
