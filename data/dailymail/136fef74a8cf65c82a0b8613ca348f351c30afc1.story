A power failure may have been responsible for the State Island ferry crashing into a dock in Manhattan Thursday afternoon.

The Department of Transportation said the 'hard landing' didn't cause any injuries or damage to the boat.

The boat had left the Whitehall terminal at 2pm bound for Staten Island, but then turned back after an unspecified mechanical problem.

According to SI Live, the ferry had neared the Statue of Liberty before it began to slow down.

Passengers tweeted from the ferry after the crash.

'We were almost halfway to SI and the ferry headed back to Manhattan. Had to lay on the ground as we docked because of the impact,' wrote one passenger.

Ed V told SI Live that ferry workers told passengers to brace for impact.

'We hit really, really hard,' he said.

A Department of Transportation spokesperson told CBS that the vessel ran into the pilings and the lower level of a bridge at a low speed.

The evening rush hour ferry service was running on a modified schedule due to the incident, causing delays for commuters.
