NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens  will warn today that Britain needs to 'get back in shape' if a public health catastrophe is to be avoided

Britain needs to ‘get back in shape’ if a public health catastrophe is to be avoided, the head of the NHS warns today.

Simon Stevens is to launch a national anti-obesity drive in the new year – as a report finds Britain is now the second fattest country in Europe.

In a clarion call to those recovering from the excesses of Christmas Day, Mr Stevens will ask GPs to identify tens of thousands of fat patients to be put on anti-diabetes programmes and offered lifestyle advice.

The NHS England chief executive will say that losing just 5 to 7 per cent of weight can cut the chance of developing diabetes by almost 60 per cent, according to research.

The warning comes as a study of 30 European nations found that only Hungary has fatter adults than Britain.

Campaigners said Britain needs to make a collective New Year’s resolution to reverse current trends, which suggest two thirds of middle-aged men will be obese in two decades, official data shows.

Mr Stevens also attacked a ‘daft’ European Court of Justice ruling last week which said obesity should be counted as a disability. He said such fatalistic talk should be abandoned in favour of a realisation that it was up to all of us to take responsibility for our health and get in shape.

‘The ghost of Christmases past reminds us that 20 years ago we didn’t have these problems as a nation,’ Mr Stevens said. ‘The ghost of Christmases future tells us that if we get our act together – as the NHS, as parents, as schools, the food industry – we can get back in shape.

‘Rather than recent daft judgments by the European Court practically pretending that obesity is inevitable, in England in 2015 we’re going to start proving that it isn’t.

‘That’s why the NHS is going to be funding a new national programme, proven to work, that will offer tens of thousands of people at risk of diabetes proper support to get healthier, eat better and exercise more.’

Under the new scheme, GPs will be asked to identify patients at risk of diabetes – especially those under 40 who are overweight. After tests for pre-diabetes, they will be advised on fitness and diet

The extent of Britain’s obesity epidemic was exposed in the latest study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its Health At A Glance Europe 2014 report shows 24.7 per cent of British adults are obese, compared with a European average of 16.7 per cent. Norway, Switzerland, Italy, Bulgaria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria and Romania all have obesity levels of less than 13 per cent. Only Hungary has higher rates of adult obesity than the UK, at 28.5 per cent.

The OECD report, based on data collected in 2012, shows Britain’s rate rose from 23 per cent in 2002. Rankings cannot be compared, as some countries in the 2014 report did not feature in 2002. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index of 30 or more, meaning the person’s weight is a danger to their health. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres. A measure of between 18.5 and 25 is healthy.

Independent research earlier this year found that obesity costs British taxpayers more than the police, prisons and fire service combined.

Mr Stevens believes anti-obesity schemes will begin saving the NHS money within three years. Under the scheme, GPs will be asked to identify patients at risk of diabetes – especially those under 40 who are overweight. After tests for pre-diabetes, they will be advised on fitness and diet, followed by regular monitoring.

Earlier this year, a major study suggested a third of Britons have borderline diabetes. The NHS spends £10billion a year treating the three million sufferers of the condition – the majority of whom have type two, linked to obesity.

Local NHS organisations that have run successful diabetes prevention schemes will be asked to help design the national programme.

Official data suggests that if obesity was reduced from the current rate of almost 25 per cent to the 1993 level of 15 per cent, about five million cases of disease could be prevented in two decades.

The National Obesity Forum’s Tam Fry said: ‘After all the food and drink consumed yesterday and today, I wouldn’t be surprised if the UK had caught up with Hungary … The National Obesity Forum is calling for a national New Year’s resolution … to tackle the aftermath of turkey, pud and cake.’

Obesity has caused 88,000 avoidable cancer cases, according to Cancer Research UK

Four in ten cancers could have been prevented over the past five years if Britons had adopted healthier lifestyles, research shows.

A toll of 600,000 avoidable cases includes 314,000 caused by smoking, 145,000 by poor diet – including eating too much red meat – and 88,000 from obesity, says Cancer Research UK.

Figures from the charity show that around 40 per cent of the 331,500 new cases diagnosed each year are directly caused by a poor lifestyle.

According to the statistics, half of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime. Scientists are urging the public to make simple lifestyle changes to slash the odds.

Researchers from Queen Mary, University of London – funded by Cancer Research UK – looked at more than 100 existing studies to calculate how many cancers diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were caused by poor lifestyle.

In addition to smoking, a poor diet and obesity, they found that a further 62,200 cases were down to excess alcohol and 55,900 from spending too much time in the sun.

Professor Max Parkin, a Cancer Research UK statistician, said: ‘There’s now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big impact on cancer risk, with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors.’

But he added that ‘we can stack the odds in our favour by taking positive steps now that will help decrease our cancer risk in future’.
