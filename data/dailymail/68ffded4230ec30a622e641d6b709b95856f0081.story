Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has refused to rule out a Spain exit despite their disastrous World Cup exit on Wednesday.

Their opening 5-1 humiliation at the hands of Holland was followed up by a lacklustre showing in their 2-0 defeat against Chile, meaning they became the first reigning champions in the history of the tournament to be knocked out after just two matches.

As well as Del Bosque, the future of senior stars such as Iker Casillas, Xavi and Xabi Alonso have also been called into question following their crushing defeats. VIDEO Scroll down to see Santiago erupt as Chile knock out reigning champions Spain

The 63-year-old took up the post in July 2008 - just after their Euro 2008 triumph - and previously overseen nothing but success during his six-year stint at the helm.

'I’d like to think about what happened and have some time to think things over,' he said. 'The truth is we’ve been together for 24 or 25 days and we were training quite well.

'We had difficulties choosing the starting team because everyone was fit. But the second half against Netherlands and the first half against Chile were a problem.

'We started with a sluggish rhythm, we were too shy, not brave enough maybe and that’s a pity because I didn’t expect that.

'Chile played as expected. They stuck to their style, their physical style and they are very, very courageous.

'I think this team is good and fit but we’ll have to take the best decision for Spanish football, and that applies to my position as well.'

'I think we have shown character despite our fairly straightforward elimination. We have gone forward, but have been unsuccessful in front of goal.

'For that we have no apology. We have all made a big effort. We had good intentions but we lacked something. We lacked a spark in the game. For the first time we have been very meek.'
