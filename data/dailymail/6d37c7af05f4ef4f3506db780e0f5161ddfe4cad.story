The BBC was forced to defend its 'ludicrous' staffing levels at Dale Farm after it was accused of outnumbering travellers and activists on the site towards the end of the protest.

As the resistance at the travellers site, near Basildon in Essex, ended with a mass exodus yesterday, the Corporation was criticised for having more journalists and technical crews on site than there were remaining protesters.

Travellers escorted their extremist 
supporters to the exit gates before themselves leaving the illegal site 
in a convoy of vans and caravans.

The BBC was accused of having about 
30 staff on site - including television crews, local correspondents and 
documentary makers - despite the numbers of travellers and demonstrators 
dwindling, it was reported.

There
were also comments from the BBC's rivals on Twitter, with ITV News 
reporter Damon Green tweeting: 'We have a tent, the BBC has a caravan at
Dale Farm. Delivering quality first.'

Earlier today a spokesman for the BBC denied the Corporation rented a caravan for the eviction coverage, 
stating the only vehicles used were two satellite trucks and two radio trucks for broadcasts and a power supply.

However, photographs have since 
emerged of a caravan with a sign in the window reading: 'This was rented
by BBC News for coverage of the Dale Farm eviction. It should not be 
removed from the site.' It was signed by the news producer.

When
told about the picture, the BBC spokesman then said there had been a 
'misunderstanding' and admitted the caravan had been rented for toilet 
facilities because 'there weren't any on site'.

He added: 'Or it could have been there for power supply.'

The Corporation said the actual number of staff on site - 24
- had been justified and added its news 
gathering team included technical 
crews and security.

Broadcast: BBC's Radio 5 Live's Aasmah Mir also reported from the scene

A spokesman also said another three BBC employees were part of 
non-news documentary team which had been on site for weeks making a 
programme about the Dale Farm eviction.

The BBC has refused to specify exactly which of their news gathering teams were reporting from the scene. However, broadcasts of the eviction have appeared on regional bulletin Look East, 
current affairs programme Newsnight and Radio 5 Live, as well as other reports on localised bulletins.

Liberal Democrat spokesman Don Foster said the staffing
levels were 'ludicrous'Â  and could affect public sympathy for the BBC's
proposed 20 per cent budget cuts, the Telegraph reported.

A spokesman said: 'The eviction at Dale Farm has been a
major rolling news story and we had 21 people there including 
reporters, producers, technical staff and security, covering the story 
locally and nationally for numerous outlets for TV, radio and online.

'A small non-news documentary team has separately been on-site for some weeks.'

Today,
Basildon Council officers - escorted by police and bailiffs - toured 
the site serving 48-hour eviction notices to those travellers who stayed
at the camp overnight and pinning them to plots.

The
notices inform residents what will be removed and includes 
demolishing fences and walls to allow access, although these will be 
reinstated.

The BBC said the staff included television and radio news gathering teams along with their technical crews and security.

It also said two satellite trucks and two radio cars were on site were for
the power supply and to enable reports to be broadcast.

On the scene: Newsnight's Tim Whewell had also reported from the site of the Dale Farm eviction

The spokesman added: 'There were 21 
people there as part of the news gathering team. This included 
television camera and radio crews and all their technical staff, sound 
engineers and security.

'(Local correspondents) would have been part of the overall news gathering team.

'There were also people from a documentary team
there, but this would have been no more than three members of staff, 
bringing the total number of BBC staff up to 24.

'We also had two trucks on site which 
wasn't for accommodation but for the power supply to put the TV reports 
out. We did not have any accommodation on site.'

And so it begins: A council official staples a notice to a fence on a plot. The notices inform residents what will be removed

The last remaining few: A little girl peers out of a window which now has an eviction notice stuck to it. Between 20 and 30 residents remained inside the site overnight - despite a mass walk-out

Dismantle: Bailiffs and council officials enter the Dale Farm travellers' site to serve 48-hour eviction notices on plots and to a few families that have remained

Eviction completed: Travellers and their supporters walk out of Dale Farm near Basildon after being driven off the land by police and bailiffs at the end of a two-day stand off
