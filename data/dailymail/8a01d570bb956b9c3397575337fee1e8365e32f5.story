A frequent flier had a bottle of Jimmy Choo perfume confiscated by airport authorities because it’s shaped like a grenade.

Lois
Lewis was stopped going through security at Phoenix Sky Harbor 
International Airport, Arizona, and a bomb expert was called in to 
access whether the bottle was authentic.

The airport closed down Lewis’s security queue at the Southwest Terminal for an hour as they investigated the 60ml bottle.

Offending bottle: Airport security staff thought a bottle of Jimmy Choo perfume was a bomb

Lewis,
a promoter for country bands, said she travels all the time and has 
taken a bottle of Jimmy Choo perfume on about 300 flights and never 
encountered a problem.

She puts the £60 bottle in a plastic bag in her hand luggage and has been questioned about it three times in the past.

Lewis,
who was flying to Denver, said: ‘They said if as a passenger you were 
to get on an airplane and you were to wave this around that people could
maybe construe that as you making some sort of a threat.’

The bomb expert took Lewis’s details, a copy of her identification and the bottle.

‘I went from humorous to alright let's be real. It's perfume,’ she said. ‘Everyone was staring.’

On
arrival to Denver, Lewis bought a new bottle of Jimmy Choo, which she 
packed into her check-in luggage, however, when she got home to Tempe 
she realised the bag had been searched and the perfume was out of its 
plastic bag.

Lewis said: ‘I 
know the Transportation Security Administration is there to protect us. I
know that. I am a traveller. I travel a lot, many, many flights a year.
I have a husband. I want to come home. I want to be safe. But I want to
be logical.’

A spokesman for 
TSA said it stands by its decision saying it has a policy that no toy 
weapons or items that replicate weapons will not be allowed through 
security because they can be perceived as a threat.

They suggest the Jimmy Choo perfume be placed in check luggage so there are no problems.
