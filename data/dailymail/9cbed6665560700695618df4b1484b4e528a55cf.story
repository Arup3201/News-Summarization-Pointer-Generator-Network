Model Kate Upton managed to grab a souvenir at a baseball match in New York.

This wasn’t any old souvenir as her boyfriend, Detroit pitcher Justin Verlander, tossed her a baseball.

Upton, 22, was sat behind the dugout in prime position to receive the baseball from her boyfriend.

Big fan: Upton clearly enjoyed the game with one of the best seats in the house behind the dugout

The model stayed for the duration of the match and clutched her momento as she left the stadium but couldn’t inspire the Detroit Tigers to victory as the Yankees ran out 2-1 winners.

Upton is one of the most desirable women in the world having appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue two years in a row.
