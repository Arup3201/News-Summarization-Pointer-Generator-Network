Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai called for NATO troops to leave Afghan villages and confine themselves to major bases after the slaughter of 16 civilians by a U.S. soldier, underscoring fury over the massacre and clouding U.S. exit plans.

In a near-simultaneous announcement, the Afghan Taliban said it was suspending nascent peace talks with the United States seen as a strong chance to end the country's decade-long conflict, blaming 'shaky, erratic and vague' U.S. statements.

Karzai, in a statement after meeting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in Kabul, said as a consequence of the weekend massacre, 'international security forces have to be taken out of Afghan village outposts and return to (larger) bases'.

In advance of his visit an Afghan man who apparently targeted U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in a suicide attack at Britain's main base in Afghanistan died of his injuries.

The civilian had sustained severe burns 
after driving on to a runway at Camp Bastion at the same time as Mr 
Panetta was landing for a visit to U.S. troops and local political 
leaders.

The White House says its approach toward the Taliban has not changed, rejecting the militant group's statements that it broke off talks because the Americans had failed to follow through on promises and had made new demands.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that the U.S. continues to support an Afghan-led process toward reconciliation. He says U.S. terms have not changed for participation in that process by the Taliban.

Carney would not discuss details of recent talks with the Taliban.

The American soldier accused of carrying out the massacre was attached to a small special forces compound similar to others around the country which underpin NATO's anti-insurgent strategy ahead of a 2014 deadline for Western combat forces to pull out.

The incident has harmed relations between Afghanistan and the United States and 'all efforts have to be done to avoid such incident in the future', Karzai said on Thursday, warning it also had hurt the trust Afghans had in foreign forces.

The night-time killings in Kandahar province on Sunday have raised questions about Western strategy in Afghanistan and intensified calls for the withdrawal of foreign combat troops.

The Taliban decision to suspend the talks was a blow to NATO hopes of a negotiated settlement to the war, which has cost the United States $510 billion and the lives of over 1,900 soldiers.

Panetta left Afghanistan shortly after his meeting with Karzai following his two day visit

The attempted suicide bomber apparently stole a truck from a British soldier after injuring the soldier in a struggle, then drove onto the runway.

He crashed into a ditch, then seems to have set himself on fire and fought with NATO troops, who managed to tackle him and put out the fire.

The incident has raised disturbing questions over security at the base.

The driver, a local male civilian 
employed at the base, died of his injuries the morning after the 
incident despite attempts to save his life in hospital.

He
 started his apparent attack by taking a truck from a British soldier, 
who suffered a broken pelvis when he was run over while trying to stop 
the hijacker.

What's the big deal? Secretary Panetta wore a big smile as he set foot at Camp Bastion

The man then drove to the runway at around the same time as Mr Panetta was landing in an Air Force aeroplane.

After his truck crashed, he jumped out of the vehicle and appeared to be on fire - although, contrary to earlier reports, the car did not blow up, nor was there any sign of explosives on board.

'For reasons that are totally unknown to us at this time, our personnel discovered that he was ablaze,' Pentagon spokesman George Little said.

The man was carrying lighter fluid and matches inside the vehicle, according to Fox News, suggesting that he may have deliberately set himself alight.

Despite being on fire, the man fought with U.S. soldiers and even jumped on to the side of their vehicle.

Target? The blast came as U.S. Mr Panetta (second right) was arriving at Camp Bastion

Mr Little added: 'Base personnel put the fire out and he was 
immediately treated for burn injuries and is still being treated. He 
sustained considerable burn wounds.'

Mr Panetta and
 his entourage were unharmed, although their plane was diverted to 
another runway to unload - and Pentagon officials said they had no 
evidence that the timing of the apparent attack was linked to the 
Defense Secretary's visit.

'We don't have any indication right 
now that this was meant as a threat to the secretary', said a spokesman.
 'As a fact we don't have any indication that the driver knew who was 
coming in on that aircraft.'

A Camp Bastion spokesman added: 
'Procedures were put in place to account for the whereabouts of all 
military and civilian personnel and, to achieve this, movement within 
Camp Bastion was restricted.'

Ministry of Defence police patrolled roads inside the base today in the wake of the incident.

Flights and movements in and out were restricted throughout the afternoon while it was investigated and were lifted later on.

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney cancelled a Canadian speaking appearance because of security concerns sparked by demonstrations during a visit he made to Vancouver last year.

Mr Cheney was scheduled to talk about his experiences in office and the current American political situation at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on April 24.

But Ryan Ruppert of Spectre Live Corp. said on Monday that Mr Cheney and his daughter Elizabeth had cancelled through their agent.

'After speaking with their security advisers, they changed their mind on coming to the event,' Mr Ruppert said. He added they had 'decided it was better for their personal safety they stay out of Canada.'

Last September 26, Mr Cheney was forced to stay holed up in the Vancouver Club for seven hours before it was deemed safe for him to leave. Demonstrators blocked the entrances and at one point scuffled with police.

Critics of Mr Cheney take issue with his endorsement of water boarding and sleep deprivation against detainees while serving in former President George W. Bush's administration.

Bastion is home to a large contingent of U.S. troops as well as UK forces.

The blast came as Mr Panetta meet with troops, commanders and Afghan government officials.

In a highly unusual move, earlier today around 200 U.S. Marines were told to leave their weapons outside a tent where U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta was set to give a talk.

Officials said the order was because 
there were two dozen unarmed Afghan soldiers in attendance and everyone 
should be treated the same.

They also denied it was related to Sunday's shooting.

'You've got one of the most important people in the world in the room,' Maj. Gen. Mark Gurganus told reporters at Camp Leatherneck. 'This is not a big deal.'

The move was unusual as in combat zones marines are usually instructed to have their weapons within close range.

One military official in Washington told NBC 'it sends the wrong message' that marines can't be trusted in the presence of the Secretary of Defense.

Mr Panetta's visit was planned months ago, 
long before the weekend slaughter by a rogue U.S. soldier that claimed 
the lives of 16 villagers, including women and children.

It also comes on the same day it emerged the U.S. soldier who massacred 16 
Afghan civilians was caught on surveillance video â€“ showing him walking 
up to his base, laying down his weapon and raising his arms in 
surrender.

An Afghan official said that the U.S. showed Afghan authorities the surveillance 
video to prove that only one perpetrator was involved in the Sunday 
shootings, an account which has been disputed.

The trip propels Mr Panetta into the centre of escalating anti-American 
anger and sets the stage for some difficult discussions with Afghan 
leaders.

Mr Panetta, who has 
said the rogue soldier could face the death penalty, told Afghan 
officials that recent violence will not deter the United States from 
carrying out its mission in Afghanistan.

The trip is the first significant visit from a U.S. dignitary since the killings, which many had worried would spark another 
wave of deadly riots like those that followed the burning of Korans at a
 U.S. base last month.

Nearly a week of violent demonstrations and 
attacks left more than 30 dead, including six U.S. soldiers killed 
apparent reprisal attacks. Six British soldiers also died last week when their armoured vehicle was blown up

Military
 commanders have yet to release their final investigation on the Koran 
burnings, which U.S. officials say was a mistake.

Five U.S. service 
members could face disciplinary action in connection with the incident.

UN
 Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today expressed deep sadness at 
the 'shocking incident' and said the UN expects that an investigation 
will rapidly establish the facts, that those responsible will be held 
accountable, and that the public will be kept informed.

'When
 it comes to the protection of civilian populations, I have been very 
vocal here and all around the world, not only in Afghanistan,' Ban told a
 group of reporters.

'We will continue to urge all authorities and 
military personnel who are engaging in these operations to pay extreme 
and utmost care to protect the civilian population.'
