As the country plunges into the depths of a record youth unemployment crisis - with one in four youngsters now out of work - you might expect any jobs would be snapped up within hours.

But a landlady has condemned Britain’s ‘stay-in-bed’ generation of youngsters after spending six months fruitlessly searching for trainee chef.

Despite one in six 16 to 24-year-olds currently being part of the unenviable NEET tribe - short for not in education, employment or training - Janette Harrop, 53, has been unable to fill the pub's vacancies.

Worth ethic: Publicans Janette and Tom Harrop are struggling to get many people even to turn up for an interview for a job in their kitchen

She has set up five interviews every week on average, but said only half of applicants have turned up.

And those offered a job, which pays the minimum wage, have failed to show up for work.

Now Janette and husband Tom, 55, who 
run the Old Original pub in Scouthead, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, 
have criticised the culture of ‘spoiling’ youngsters with pocket money 
instead of instilling a basic work ethic in them.

It comes 24 hours after deputy Prime 
Minister Nick Clegg launched the £1billion ‘youth contract’ scheme in a bid to
create jobs for youngsters after figures revealed more than a million 
16 to 24-year-olds are without a job, more than at any time since 
records began in 1992.

Mrs Harrop said: ‘Our pub is a 
fantastic place to work - it’s a young hard working team and another 
youngster would fit in and enjoy working here.

‘But we are struggling to find that 
person to become an apprentice because of lack of reliability. I have to
say it’s not an easy job and it’s not a doddle but it’s one you can get
a lot out of and hopefully have a whole career in.

‘We’ve had about 30 people apply but 
barely half of those turn up for interviews. It just wastes my time as 
well waiting for them.

Help needed: Tom Harrop says when the job in the pub's kitchen was offered to an applicant, they turned up late or not at all

‘After a bit you’re a bit cynical and 
just think they won’t turn up, so I wait 20 minutes and then I won’t 
wait any longer because I’m too busy.

‘Most of them just don’t turn up, 
they’re full of enthusiasm over the phone and then they don’t bother. 
Some of them you ask for a trial and they might start off okay but then 
they just let you down.

‘People come to work here then realise
the shifts are unsociable hours. That’s when they realise their friends
are out doing other things whilst they are working. It doesn’t help and
they let us down.

‘All we want to do is give someone a chance but it’s just finding that person.’

The post as a trainee chef would involve the chance to train on a 
local college course so the person would be a fully qualified chef at 
the end.

The position includes food 
preparation, cooking, cleaning, learning to keep the books and at the 
beginning is a 30 hour week, with most mornings starting at rather leisurely 10am.

Mr and Mrs Harrop expected hoards of 
eager youngsters wanting to snap up the trainee chef job and advertised 
in local shops, the job centre, the pub itself and local colleges, last 
October.

But despite youth unemployment being 
at an all-time high the couple had just 30 people apply for the position
- with only half bothering to turn up for the interview.

No takers: Despite lots of advertising, pub landlords Tom and Janette Harrop have been unable to recruit any pot washers, bar staff or a kitchen apprentice

One hopeful blamed his lack of bus 
fare for not being able to come while others just never even called. 
When the applicants were invited for trial weeks they would often just 
stop coming without warning.

Janette thinks a lack of commitment to
hard work and more of a focus on their social life has led to the 
record numbers of young people who are out of work across the country.

Mrs Harrop added: ‘Since we first 
advertised the job in schools, colleges and the job centre, we’ve had an
average of about five interviews set up every week. I’m lucky if two of
the applicants turn up.

‘The people who have taken the job have been unreliable, claiming they’ve got no bus fare and making excuses week after week.

‘Some youngsters are only too keen to 
stay in bed on a work day because they have been enjoying themselves the
night before and we’ve allowed them to get away with it.

‘I think we spoil our children now. In our day we had to do paper rounds or milk rounds, you got yourself prepared for work.

Condemnation: Publicans Janette and Tom Harrop who run The Old Original pub in Scouthead, Oldham, blame a something for nothing culture for their difficulties recruiting kitchen staff

‘But whilst the world’s changed due to safety worries, it does make work suddenly come as a bit of a shock.

‘I think a lot of youngsters go out at
night and can’t be bothered in the morning. But it’s not that early, 
it’s a 10am start for us - a lot of jobs are a 7am or 8 am start.

‘It is unsociable hours and we are out of the way and it is a big commitment but it’s a job.

‘I know they want to do both, going 
out and working, but they just can’t when it comes to the next day and 
getting up, they’re not fit for work.

‘We want them by the end to be a fully
qualified chef. It’s like any job the money isn’t fantastic at the 
start but you work your way up, it’s a career.

‘We’re looking to employ someone who 
we can send to college. They’d be doing NVQ certificates to do the job 
professionally and long term. We’re offering someone the chance of 
further education.’

Minimum wages for apprentices start at
£2.60 an hour between the aged of 16 and 19 or £3.68 hourly pay for 
employees aged between 16 and 17 and £4.98 for 18 to 20 year olds. Over 
21s can get a minimum of £6.08.

On Tuesday Mr Clegg said youth 
unemployment was akin to a ‘ticking time bomb.’ His youth contract is 
designed to get young people ‘earning or learning.’
