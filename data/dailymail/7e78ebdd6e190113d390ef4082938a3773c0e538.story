Security-conscious: George Harrison's widow Olivia had applied to install razor wire fencing outside her Oxfordshire mansion

George Harrison's wife has been forced to abandon attempts to erect more razor wire around her mansion amid anger from neighbours who claim it makes the exclusive area resemble a 'war zone'.

The late Beatle's widow Olivia Harrison had applied to the council for permission to install galvanised razor wire on a section of the fence surrounding her palatial Oxfordshire home, but was told the unsightly security measure had 'no place' in Henley-on-Thames.

It is the second time Mrs Harrison has clashed with neighbours on the issue; three years ago actor Rodney Bewes objected to the 64-year-old's plan to renew an existing 1,000 yard section of razor wire on top of a tall fence, claiming it had 'nearly killed' his cat, Maurice.

Mr Bewes, who played Bob Ferris in the comedy series The Likely Lads, said at the time that injuries to his pet had cost him thousands in vet bills, and added that he knew of several other neighbourhood cats that had been 'practically gored' on the wire fence at Â£20million Friar Park.

'It makes me sad when I come home to this beautiful place and see this thing that makes it look like a war-zone, the actor said in 2009.

Security-conscious Mrs Harrison is
said to remain haunted by a terrifying break-in at Friar Park in 1999, 
when she fought off a schizophrenic who stabbed her husband 
in the chest.

Mr Harrison was stabbed seven times in the chest in a frenzied attack that ended only when his wife knocked the intruder, Michael Abram, unconscious with an oil lamp.

Abram was later found not guilty of attempted murder by reason of insanity, and was sent to a secure psychiatric hospital. He was released in 2002.

Razor wire fencing was erected around the sprawling mansion following the attack as a means of deterring any further trespassers.

George Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

'War-zone': Razor wire on top of the fence surrounding Olivia Harrison's home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire

Mrs Harrison had wooden fencing built instead of renewing the section of wire following the complaints from Mr Bewes three years ago.

Now her latest application has been refused by planning officials, after neighbours branded the metal fencing an eyesore.

Marin Akehurst, vice-chairman of Henley town council's planning committee, said: 'Razor wire has no place in Henley,' according to a report in The Telegraph.

The council has approved an amended application for wooden fences.
