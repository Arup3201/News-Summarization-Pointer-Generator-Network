With jutting stone pillars reaching towards a beacon of celestial light high in the roof, the majestic 'cathedral' chamber certainly lives up to its name.

This amazing 125-foot tall chasm is actually just one of a number of stunning rooms and passages in an abandoned mine in Wiltshire.

The shots were taken during a caving-camping trip by photographer Robbie Khan - and capture the stark beauty of this ancient free-stone quarry, located in the tiny town of Box.

He descended into the dark depths with a fire-juggling friends Oliver Nelson and Myk YP to cast a unique light around the interior of the mine, which is said to date back to Roman times.

The 'cathedral' chamber is an impressive 125-feet tall, 120-feet wide and 120-feet long.

In the early morning, when the photo was taken, the condensation from the stone creates an eerie mist.

The Box Freestone Mine was worked since the Roman era, reaching it peak stone production in the 19th century, until it was abandoned in 1968.

It was progressively enlarged over the years and now has more than 90km of passages divided into three sections - northern, central and southern.

According to The Mine Explorer Society, it retains many impressive features such as tools, work benches, cranes and wells.

It is a mecca for brave explorers and professional cavers, but
only five to 10 secret entrances are used by them.

It is also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the number of bat species which reside in the mine.

Caving
in such an environment can be incredibly dangerous unless you are very 
experienced, according to Mr Khan, as there are scores of open 
wells littered about and if you don't have adequate lighting - they 
could be fatal.

He said: 'As long as you have all the right gear and lighting - lighting is vital - you're fine. But you have to be experienced too and always wear a hard hat.

'There are open wells scattered about and I'm not sure how deep they are but you can't see the bottom.

'My explorer friends and I went to the Box quarry last month and some even camped down there with tents and had barbecues. Crazy.

'One of my friends is a juggler so he juggled fire down there.'

According to Robbie, the quarry is slowly collapsing so explorers have to be aware of that too.

He said: 'It's caving in over time so you have to check the state of the rock and make decisions about which routes are unwise to take.

Robbie added: 'But I love the excitement and the sheer size of places like this.

'Abandoned places like this really inspire me to take photos of places that most people will never see.'
