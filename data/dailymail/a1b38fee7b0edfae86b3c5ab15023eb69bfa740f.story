Sir Alex Ferguson told a room full of reporters that a woman colleague had 'been dragged out of the kitchen' to speak to them.

The Manchester United manager made the joke about senior press officer Karen Shotbolt at a press conference on Friday.

The experienced media manager, who has been at Old Trafford since 2004, told journalists to have a 'Happy International Women's Day', according to The Sun.

Karen Shotbolt, right, denied she was offended by Sir Alex Ferguson's comments on International Women's Day that she had been 'dragged out of the kitchen'

Ferguson then responded: 'She has dragged herself out of the kitchen. You asked for that,' before laughing.

A day later Ms Shotbolt, 43, said she took the comment as a joke and denied the United manager makes similar inappropriate comments.

She told The Sun: 'I was joking with the journalists and most of them laughed.'

In 2011, it emerged that Ferguson had told a female physiotherapist who applied for a job that it was a 'male sport' and footballers did not like to be treated by women.

The rejection letter from 1994 was leaked to The Mail on Sunday.

It read: 'Most of the players felt 
that football was very much a male sport and did not really like the 
thought of females being involved with the treatment of sports injuries 
within the training complex.'

The letter, signed by the 71-year-old, was written in response to a 20-year-old physio’s request for a work placement and left her ‘hurt and insulted’.

She did not want to be named but said she was 'shocked' by the language in the letter.

The physio said: ‘I really can’t see why the players would object – there are loads of female physios in rugby.’

Elsewhere
in the letter, Sir Alex says: ‘The general thoughts of the players 
regarding a female physiotherapist was that they would prefer to be 
treated by a male physiotherapist, they would feel more comfortable and 
they felt it would be much easier to discuss their problems with another
male.’

At the time, the club denied the comments were sexist and a club spokeswoman said 'the football environment' has changed.
