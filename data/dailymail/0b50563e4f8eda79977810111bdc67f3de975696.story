And the winner is... well, nobody. 

That seemed to be the only result after two Indian beauty queens aiming to impress visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both ended up looking like losers.

One because she hosted the gathering after claiming to be Miss India Australia 2014 when she wasn't, and the other because, although she was Miss India Australia 2014, the confusion meant she missed out on the opportunity to host the lavish event herself in Sydney for India's leader. Mr Modi is the first Indian leader to visit Australia in 28 years.

The Herald Sun reported that the claws were out between the two battling beauties, Rashi Kapoor and Phalguni Kataria, after Australian Football League multicultural ambassador Ms Kapoor hosted a get-together for the Indian Primer Minister as Miss India Australia 2014 when the title actually belonged to Ms Kataria.

Miss India Australia 2014, Phalguni Kataria, felt hard done by at not being asked to host a special event in Sydney for visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Ms Kataria said she was devastated at missing out on the opportunity to host the event and 'utterly shocked someone else is claiming to be Miss India Australia'. While Ms Kapoor said it was all just a simple misunderstanding. Ms Kapoor said she usually went by her title, Miss India Global, and it was the Indian media that was at fault for the mix up.

Miss India Australia 2013, Rashi Kapoor, blamed the Indian media for the misunderstanding  

'I would never portray myself as something I am not. They got confused and I didn’t want to correct them. It was an event for the Prime Minister, not me,' she told the Herald Sun.

'I actually won Miss India Global in 2013. That’s what my trophy says.'

But Ms Kataria said: 'That (Miss India Australia) is my title. I worked hard for it.'

Ms Kataria was 'utterly shocked someone else is claiming to be Miss India Australia'

'I had thought that it would be me who would be asked to host the Prime Minister, like Miss India USA had done in America.

'I cannot believe that someone else can just step in and do it and take this honour from me.'

Miss India Australia organiser Reena Koak believed it was unfair Ms Kapoor was portrayed as the 2014 titleholder as Ms Kataria now held the crown.

Ms Kapoor said she usually went by the title of Miss India Global, although this was disputed  

Ms Kapoor was crowned Miss India Australia in 2013, but it was claimed she currently held the title of Miss India Melbourne, not Miss India Global.

Organiser Anamika Srivastava admits that a printing error may have resulted in the wrong titles appearing on Ms Kapoor’s sash and trophy. Despite the fact she had been already told by organisers that she could no longer use the title.

Ms Kataria believed there should be no confusion over who is Miss India Australia 2014
