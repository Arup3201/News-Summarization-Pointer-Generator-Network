She recently ended her two-year relationship with TOWIE co-star Ricky Rayment - but it seems that the single life suits Jessica Wright.

Some people sit around and mope following a break-up but not Jess. The 29-year-old hit the gym, shook up her style and curated a chic new collection. 

The Essex-born reality TV star and fashion designer looks better than ever as she showcases her spring/summer 15 designs for Lipstick Boutique.

Jessica Wright of TOWIE fame has unveiled her spring/summer 15 fashion range for Lipstick Boutique

Speaking about her new drop, which ranges in price between £35-£80, Jessica told FEMAIL: 'This is all really exciting and I have been much braver with the prints this season by incorporating lots of floral and colour block.'

Moving the brand forward for spring/summer, Jessica has taken on board customer feedback and enhanced the range by adding more shapes, such as long, midi and skater. 'Tight and short skirts can often look tacky so I have taken real care when designing the cuts of the clothes,' said Jess.

Citing her muse as 'amazing' Blake Lively, Jess says she's taken a 'tiny' bit of inspiration from Victoria Beckham, whose shift dresses she loves, and it would be a 'dream come true' to see Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wearing her designs. 

As well as watching her collection evolve, Jess has also seen her own style change over the years.

'We all had the typical bodycon dresses when we started out on TOWIE,' said Jess of herself and her co-stars' dress sense. 

'But now I have a much more mature outlook on fashion, it has become a real passion of mine. I don't have a stylist, I just totally dress myself.'

So enamored is Jess with all things style that she's planning on launching a shoe collection.

'I am a total shoe addict, footwear is my thing,' she said of her upcoming range of 'beautiful brogues, heels and ankle boots'.

Business is booming for Jess, who says it's all 'go, go, go' with filming, various projects and socialising.

She added: 'I want to continue doing what I love, especially fashion, and now I'm single I want to travel the world.'

As well as watching her collection evolve, Jess has also seen her own style change over the years and she's adopted a much more streamlined approach to styling herself
