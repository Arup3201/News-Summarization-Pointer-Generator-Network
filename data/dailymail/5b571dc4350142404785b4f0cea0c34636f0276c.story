From deepest, darkest Somerset, Alice Temperley is plotting to take over the fashion world. And if she's not, she should be after unveiling a collection that put London's wackier elements firmly in their place.

Temperley made her name with bohemian flowing dresses and while the odd blast of boho still crops up, by and large, this was a romantically grown-up vision that will please urban girls and country ladies alike.

Shimmering silk-organza gowns in cream and blush pink gave way to darkly dramatic dresses dressed up with fringed capes and festooned with neatly embroidered flowers.

Taking over the world: This season, Alice Temperley offered up a seriously pretty collection of grown-up gowns

The flowers, a favoured motif of Temperley's, returned again and again, most successfully on a stunning hot pink gown, loose-fitting and crafted from a blend of delicate organza and silk.

There was a dash of purple print too, on frocks that had more than a hint of Nicholas Ghesqui√®re era Balenciaga about them, and a surprisingly successful attempt to combine loud leopard print with feminine florals.

Florals reappeared again, this time as a delicate pale pink print blooming across a neat oat-coloured tea dress and once more on a show-stopping bias cut gown of the sort Alice Temperley does so well.

Most of all though, the overwhelming impression was of pink, pink and more pink. Temperley had clearly taken inspiration from legendary Harpers Bazaar editor Diana Vreeland, who famously exhorted readers to 'think pink'.

It certainly worked at Temperley.

Temperley's offering was unabashedly pretty - and should make some of next summer's brides happy

Show-stoppers: Temperley's trademark flowing gowns appeared embroidered with flowers in silk and organza

Despite the success of her trailing show
stoppers, Temperley hared off in a new direction with her shorter 
offerings, which came with structured A-line skirts and nipped in 
waists.

Better still were her beautifully cut column gowns, a world away from the folksy efforts of earlier collections, which added a shot of 30s elegance to the collection.

One narrow-skirted effort in a winning combination of rose, pale pink and black silk looked more Chanel than Temperley - and it was all to the credit of the designer.

Best of all though, were the skirts. Temperley doesn't really do trousers but she does maxis like she means them and that was certainly the case here.

Whether gently puffed animal print or inky ruched tulle, Temperley's were a tour de force.
