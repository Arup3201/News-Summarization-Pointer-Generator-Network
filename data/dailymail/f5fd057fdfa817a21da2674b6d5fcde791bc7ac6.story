These are the images you have to look twice at to realise exactly what they are.

But that is photographer Thorsten Scheuermann's aim. The globetrotter has travelled the world to snap a series of photos that take a left-field view at nature's beauty, concentrating on one sole object.

Thorsten captures the luminous, boiling lava of Kilauea Volcano, blue cracked mud in Oregon's Alvord Desert, and a humble row of trees in Leavenworth, Washington.

'These are sights that can gain greater significance and have their beauty exposed when excluding everything else around them,' he explains.

'I learned to enjoy little moments of beauty around me in everyday life - things like evening light filtering through leaves or an interesting cloud formation spotted during my commute.

'I would be delighted if my images encouraged people to pay more attention to their environment.'

In most cases, such as the National Monument's Painted Hills, also in Oregon, nature does the hard work for Thorsten which is just the way he likes it.

'I absolutely love being outdoors with my camera,' he says. 'Even when the weather conditions aren't what I was hoping for or if I leave without any photos that are worthwhile, I always have a good time just getting out there and enjoy the process of looking for photo opportunities.

'Typically, people like the colours and patterns in these photos. I'm satisfied when I notice viewers having to look twice, as they try to make sense of what they're looking at.

'I'm always critical of my own work and see lots of opportunity for improvement. But since that means spending more time outside photographing, it's motivating rather than discouraging.'

Almost an optical illusion, this images shows the beautiful colours of the swirling rivers near Santa Cruz, California

Such a complex creature, this is a close-up view of the bottom of an octopus with its elaborate patterns of suckers at the Seattle Aquarium 

Simply and pure beauty is what Thorsten strives to captures, such as with this shot of a tree in Sequoia National Park, California

These bizarre patterns are formed by ice bubbles in the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon

Palo Alto is probably better known for being the home of companies such as Google and Facebook, but this swirling river pattern outside the city deserves its own fame

Cracked mud captured in the Alvord Desert, Oregon, has a unique blue hue

The Painted Hills in National Monument, Oregon, have remarkable patterns that look as though there must have been intervention from man to create them

 The colours are formed by different kinds and ages of rock that have been shaped over time into these amazing formations
