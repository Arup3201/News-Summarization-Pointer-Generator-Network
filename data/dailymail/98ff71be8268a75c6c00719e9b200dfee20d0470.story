Verdict: Michelle George, a mother-of-two was given a suspended 18-week sentence

A mother-of two who was left feeling 'disfigured' after breast cancer, sent obscene notes to two teenage couples on her street because she was ‘jealous’ of them.

Michelle George, who is in her late forties, also bombarded the youngsters with constant phone-calls.

Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard that George had suffered a breakdown and was also coming to terms with her husband and mother being diagnosed with cancer.

Alongside this she was still struggling with her own illness and her father dying from leukaemia.

George, from Guisborough, Cleveland, was spared jail on Monday after magistrates gave her a suspended 18-week sentence.

Lyn Roberts, prosecuting, said George had started harassing her neighbour, 18-year-old James Morgan, and his younger girlfriend.

She had sent notes purporting to be from a girl called ‘Chloe’, accusing the victim of cheating on his partner.

Then, in September last year, she started making phonecalls and sending letters to 19-year-old Hannah Draboczy, who lived nearby, and her boyfriend Benjamin Linsley, also 19.

When Miss Draboczy asked who was calling, she replied: 'Chloe'.

George also sent explicit letters to Miss Draboczy’s mother and her partner.

In a victim statement to the court, both Miss Draboczy and Mr Linsley said they felt as though they were being watched constantly because the letters described what they were wearing on certain days and even what gifts they received at Christmas.

All the victims felt suspicious of everyone around them and one was receiving medical treatment for panic attacks and stress.

Ms Roberts said: 'When Mrs George was questioned by police, she said she had been through a rough time and saw Hannah and Ben one day and the fact they seemed so happy made her jealous.'

Rachel Mason, mitigating, said: 'She is recovering from breast cancer and considered herself disfigured and it had a massive effect on her emotional wellbeing.'

Miss Mason denied George had been stalking her victims, saying she got her information from social networking sites.

'Speaking to Mrs George’s doctor, he says she has had an emotional breakdown.'

George had previously admitted four counts of harassment.

She was ordered to pay £400 compensation to her victims and £85 towards court costs.

She is also under a supervision order.

After the case, Miss Draboczy said: 'Michelle George put Ben and I and our families through hell for seven months and even now we can’t fully understand why she targeted us in this way.

'Not knowing who was behind this campaign was very difficult and we found ourselves suspecting everyone, even those close to us.'
