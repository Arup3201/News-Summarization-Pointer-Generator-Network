House prices rose by a 'surprising' 1.3 per cent - the biggest monthly increase in more than two-and-a-half years.

Figures released by Nationwide revealed that the average house price is now £164,729,  reversing declines recorded over the previous two months.

It is the biggest monthly increase since January 2010, the building society said.

However, prices are still 0.7 per cent lower than they were a year ago and the market remains volatile against the tough economic backdrop.

Britain's biggest building 
society also highlighted how many first-time buyers continue to be 
prevented from getting onto the property ladder by big deposit demands.

The
average new homeowner currently has to put down a 20 per cent deposit -
double the level seen before the financial crisis hit.

Recent house price studies have highlighted the difficult and unpredictable nature of the market, often with strong regional variations.

Property analyst Hometrack predicted earlier this week that prices will come under downward pressure for the rest of the year due to relatively weak buyer demand compared with the number of homes on the market.

Analysts have said they have seen little evidence so far that a recently-launched funding for lending scheme by the Bank of England and the Treasury has done much to increase the availability of mortgages for people with lower deposits and first-time buyers, with the choice available shrinking back over the last six months.

The scheme has not stopped Nationwide and Santander announcing some increases to their mortgage rates.

In an indication of what is to come, Bank of England figures published yesterday showed that mortgage approvals increased slightly in July compared with an 18-month low recorded in June.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: 'Given the difficult economic backdrop, the extent of the rebound in August is a little surprising.

'However, we should never read too much into one month's data, especially since monthly price changes have been impacted by a number of one-off factors this year, such as the ending of the stamp duty holiday for first time buyers.'

He said the fact that the annual 
decline has slowed down from a 2.6 per cent drop recorded in July 
provides some evidence that the market is 'fairly stable'.

Mr
Gardner said: 'This may be explained by the surprising resilience 
evident in the UK labour market, with further increases in employment in
recent months, even though the UK economy has remained in recession.'

Flatlining: House prices have remained relatively stable after the bounce back from the 2008 to 2009 lows ended.

Mr Gardner said that the future of the housing market will be strongly affected by what happens in the labour market.

He said: 'House prices are expected to
remain fairly stable over the next two years, while incomes are likely 
to continue to rise gradually, which will also help to support 
affordability.'

Nationwide 
highlighted the 'marked differences' between today's market, where the 
average first-time buyer needs to raise a 20 per cent deposit, compared 
with conditions between 2005 and 2007, when a 10 per cent deposit was 
typically put down.

Then and now: How the market compares for first-time buyers

The number of mortgage approvals is running at around 50,000 a month, roughly half the level between 2005 and 2007.

For those who manage to get on the property ladder, low interest rates and house price falls mean that monthly repayments for a first-time buyer with a 20 per cent deposit have declined to around 29 per cent of take home pay typically, down from 40 per cent before the financial crisis struck, Nationwide said.

More affordable: Property is slightly cheaper than the 2005 to 2007 average and mortgage rates are lower.
