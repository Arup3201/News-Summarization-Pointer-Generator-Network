Scientists have discovered the gene that protects young and middle-aged adults from strokes.

People with a specific variant of a gene, known as PHACTR1, have a lower risk of suffering a cervical artery dissection - one of the most common causes of strokes in those under the age of 50.  

A cervical artery dissection is a tear in the artery in the nec, that leads to the brain.

The tear can lead to blood clots developing, which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.

The same gene variant has also been identified as a protector against migraines and affects the risk of heart attack.

Scientists hope the breakthrough will herald new treatments and strategies to stop strokes in young people.

Approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke each year.

In the UK 152,000 people a year suffer a stroke. It is the third largest cause of death after heart disease and cancer.

Brain injuries caused by strokes are a major cause of adult disability in the UK, with a quarter of these people aged under 65.

Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the lining in one of the arteries in the neck. 

This can make a person more likely to develop blood clots, which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and lead to a stroke.  

Blood clots can then become stuck in the tear in the artery wall, or they can break off and travel to the brain.

When the blood flow to the brain is disrupted, it can become starved of oxygen and nutrients. 

This damages brain cells and they begin to die. The brain controls everything the body does, including  movement, speech, vision and emotions.

Professor of Clinical Neurology Pankaj Sharma, of Royal Holloway, University of London, said: 'This is an important breakthrough.'

The findings provide scientists with a greater understanding of how this gene appears to influence key functions, he added.

He continued: 'This could have major implications for the treatment of these severe and disabling conditions.'

The study was the largest of its kind and involved researchers from around the world screening the entire genome of 1,400 patients with cervical artery dissection.

Another  14,400 people without the disease were also studied.

Cervical artery dissection can lead to the adjacent nerves in the neck being compressed.

This can  lead to blood clotting, which potentially causes blockages, which lead to strokes or even brain damage if the clots travel to the brain.

Professor Sharma added: 'Further genetic analyses and worldwide collaborations of this kind provide hope of pinpointing the underlying mechanisms that cause stroke.

'The Bio-Repository of DNA in Stroke (BRAINS) study I am leading is creating a large stroke DNA biobank which will give an exciting opportunity to identify the genes directly linked to the condition.'

The study published in the journal Nature Genetics.
