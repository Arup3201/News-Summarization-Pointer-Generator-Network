A married couple has been awarded over $1 million in compensation after successfully bringing a harassment complaint against Bank of America for being subjected to hundreds of loan collection calls over a four year period.

Nelson and Joyce Coniglio, of Tampa, Florida, received more than 700 automated calls after they fell behind on mortgage loan payments in 2009.

In a complaint filed in federal court in July, attorneys for the couple said they had been on the receiving end of 'patterns of outrageous, abusive and harassing conduct' by a subsidiary of Bank of America.

The Coniglios, who are both 69 and have been married for 45 years, also received 'threatening collection letters asserting false and misleading information,' the complaint said.

Over the years, the couple had sent multiple cease-and-desist letters from lawyers asking the bank to stop, but the robocalls - sometimes up to five a day - continued.

'They treated us very badly,' Nelson told WTSP. 'No two ways about it.'

'We would be out at dinner and they would ring my mother's cellphone,' son Jason Coniglio told the Tampa Bay Times, 'then they would call my dad's cellphone and then when we got back to the house, there would be another message on the answering machine.'

At their wits ends, the couple sued under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act.

'Once a debt collector is told to stop calling, whether it be in writing or verbally, it doesn't make a difference,' said David Mitchell, one of the family's attorneys.

Bank of America, which lost the case because it missed the deadline to oppose the lawsuit, maintains that the calls were to help the Coniglios avoid foreclosure

'Every call after that is considered a willful violation of the (law.)'

The Coniglios won by default in October after the bank missed the deadline to oppose the lawsuit.

Last week the judge dismissed the bank's attempt to set aside the default judgment and awarded the couple $1,051,000 - approximately $1,500 for every call - in addition to court costs and attorney fees.

'This judgment against Bank of America is an epic win for consumers across the country,' Billy Howard, an attorney for the Coniglios told ABC News. 'It's time to fight back against these 'robo-bullies'.'

'Because our calls were not answered and our efforts to help the Coniglios avoid foreclosure were urgent, these calls continued. We are committed to help homeowners in need of assistance avoid foreclosure,' said Bank of America Senior Vice President Dan Frahm.

The Coniglios' case isn't the first time Bank of America has faced accusations of intense harassment by phone.

In September 2013, the bank paid a record $32 million to settle a class action lawsuit with a reported 7.7 million customers who claimed they were harassed by such 'robocalls.' In that case, Bank of America said it denied the allegations but settled to avoid further legal costs.
