He may have narrowly missed out on guiding Liverpool to their first league title in 24 years, but Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is all smiles as he enjoys an outing with Charlotte Hind and her daughter at a small village in Spain.

Rodgers clearly gets along well with the little girl as he was seen sharing a tender moment, giving her a hug as her mother, 31, the former travel coordinator of the club,  looked on smiling.

The trio looked relaxed and happy as they went shopping and for a stroll in the sun-kissed locale.

The Reds manager, 41, was also pictured lifting the little girl out of the child seat of a shopping trolley.

Ms Hind is divorcing her husband of five years Steven but Rodgers has denied having a relationship with Ms Hind.

Last month Rodgers was at Ms Hind's home when a man battered the front door with a cricket bat.

Rodgers was at the Birkdale, Southport, home of Ms Hind when the man pulled up in his car and began honking his horn and hurling abuse.

Change: Rodgers has moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb of Liverpool for £1.2million

Rodgers told the man, believed to be in his early 20s, to leave, but he instead started swearing and shouting for Rodgers to come into the street, before grabbing the bat from his car and attacking the front door.

He then jumped back in his car and left. Neighbours called the police and three squad cars arrived, but the man was gone.

A neighbour told the Mirror: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn.

'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.'

Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football.

Rodgers has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat.

The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training ground.

Mr Rodgers has also moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan, according to The Sun's Guy Patrick, and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb of the city for £1.2million.
