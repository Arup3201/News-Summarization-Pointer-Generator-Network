Hartlepool defender Scott Harrison wasted no time in taking advantage of a stricken referee as he used the official’s vanishing spray during the clash with Oxford United.

Referee Patrick Miller tumbled to the deck during the game at the Kassam Stadium before players from both sides surrounded him to check he was alright.

However, 21-year-old Harrison saw the incident as his chance to have a go with the spray himself.

Team-mate Neil Austin picked up the canister after it had fallen out of the pocket of the official as he fell to the floor.

But it was Harrison who took advantage, drawing an outline around the referee as if to show where the foul was committed.

Hartlepool are rooted to the bottom of League Two, but team spirit is certainly not an issue as he amused his fellow team-mates.

A 2-0 victory was enough to earn the away side all three points on the night as well as give them a slight glimmer of hope of staying in the division.

However, it was not such a happy ending for the poor official who left the pitch on a stretcher.
