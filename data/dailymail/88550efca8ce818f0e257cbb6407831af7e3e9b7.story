Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital as the two European heavyweights go head to head in the last 16 of the Champions League.

It could see Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas and more take to the pitch at the Parc des Princes among a star-studded line up.

Yet they say behind every great man is a great woman. Here, Sportsmail look at a selection of the WAGs from Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea and Ligue 1 giants PSG.

THE 'BUSINESSWOMEN'

Helena Seger (Zlatan Ibrahimovic)

Ibrahimovic's long-time partner is known as a multimillionaire businesswoman who doesn't take any prisoners. They have two sons, Maximilian and Vincent. Helena was marketing director of Swatch and FlyMe, and local tabloids previously dubbed her the 'Queen Bee of French WAGs'.

Natasha Hazard (Eden Hazard)

Hazard married in 2012 and has two boys, Yannis and Leo, with Natasha. The Chelsea man previously told Canal+ that he could be swayed to move to Paris if his wife told him she wanted their family to live in France. Unlike other WAGs, Natasha largely stays away from the media if she can.
