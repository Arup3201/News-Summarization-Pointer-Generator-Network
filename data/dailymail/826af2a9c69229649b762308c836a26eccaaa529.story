A thief who tried to steal a service dog from a woman with cerebral palsy was sentenced to 2 years behind bars on Friday.

Quincy T. Mathews, 20, pled guilty to robbery on  in an Ohio court, The Toledo Blade reports.

Surveillance footage caught Mathews in July trying to steal a service dog from Arrica Okenka, 30, on a Toledo bus. Police posted the video to Facebook and asked to public to help identify the would-be thief, Northwest Ohio reports.

Mathews said in court that he had talked with Okenka on the bus that afternoon

'Prior to me exiting the bus, I reached for what I thought was her purse, but it was the leash for her dog,' Mathews said. He added that he let go when he realized he had grabbed the leash.

Okenka was angered by Mathews' comments in court.

She told Judge Gene Zmuda 'If he wanted my purse, I keep it on the back of my [wheel]chair.'

Okenka also said that Mathews 
watched as she dropped a card and the dog picked it up for her — a 
command she demonstrated for the court, the Blade reports.

Mathews, she said, asked to
use her cell phone and she let him. He also allegedly questioned Okenka about her dog and whether it would bite someone who harmed her, the Blade reports.

'I didn’t realize he was going to take the dog,' she said. 'I thought he asked that because he was going to take off with my 
phone.'

Okenka has had the dog named Ingrid for four years, and usually does not hold its leash. She held tight as Mathews yanked in vain and then ran off the bus after a few unsuccessful pulls.

She told WTVG in July that she held on so tightly the leash cut her hand when Mathews tried to steal Ingrid.

‘A lot of times, I don't have a hold of her leash, because she's so trained, I just let her lay down,’ Okenka told the Toledo Blade in July.

Ingrid helps Okenka with almost everything, from dressing and undressing to opening and closing doors, picking up things she drops and other routine tasks, she told the Blade.

Okenka was confused as to why the man would want Ingrid, telling WTVG that maybe he wanted to use her for fighting and wondering to the Blade if he thought he could sell the dog because of her training.

The dog would not be of much use to anyone else, Okenka explained to the paper in July.

‘She's trained to do them for me, you can drop things all day long and she's just going to look at you,’ Okenka said.

Matthews told the court 'What I did was senseless and dumb, and it should have never happened.'

Judge Zmuda described Matthews as predatory, told him 'You saw how scared she still is [...]You caused that, and as you stand before me, I don’t think you care at all. You have a lot of growing up to do,' the Blade reports.
