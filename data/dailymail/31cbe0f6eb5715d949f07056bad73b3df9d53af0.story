At 42 years and 110 days old, Mark Schwarzer is hardly a fresh-faced debutant.

But the Australian goalkeeper insists he feels ‘fitter, stronger, better’ than ever as he fights to make his first appearance for Leicester City on Saturday at White Hart Lane.

Nigel Pearson never gives much away about team selection, but an FA Cup tie against Tottenham may provide his new signing with some action.

Ben Hamer has done an excellent job deputising for the injured Kasper Schmeichel, who is still a few weeks away from fitness after breaking a metatarsal, but Schwarzer is eager to play his part, following a spell at Chelsea behind two of the world’s best in Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech.

‘I want to be judged each week, to have that pressure again,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘It’s something the last six months has lacked. I feel very fit and ready to go.’ The man with 109 Australia caps has signed an 18-month contract at Leicester and should Pearson hand him a start today, he aims to grasp it with both hands.

Were Schwarzer then able to help his club stay in the top flight, he stands every chance of breaking John Burridge’s long-held record for oldest player to appear in the Premier League.

Schwarzer attributes the freshness he feels in his forties to a switch in gym workouts five years ago, rather than any drive to play past Burridge’s mark of 43 years and 162 days, set when keeping goal for Manchester City in 1995.

‘It has been mentioned that if I play for a certain time I will break records but it’s not something that inspires me,’ he says. ‘I continue because I enjoy playing and training so much, and hopefully I’m good enough.

‘That’s why Leicester have signed me, because they believe I’m still good enough to perform at the highest level and contribute to the team.’

Keep in mind March 16, 2016. Any Premier League appearance beyond that for Schwarzer will see Burridge’s record surpassed. A sign of Schwarzer’s longevity can be gauged by the fact he played behind Pearson in the Middlesbrough team that won promotion to the Premier League in 1997-98.

‘He was one of the best centre halves I’ve played with,’ says Schwarzer. ‘He is as a person and manager like he was as a player: very straight, very calm, very assuring and confident in his own ability.’

Tom Lawrence, who started Leicester’s FA Cup win over Newcastle, was aged one when Schwarzer made his debut on these shores for Bradford City. The likes of Liam Moore, Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez were not born as he began his career at Marconi Stallions in Sydney 25 years ago.

But Schwarzer has plenty left in the tank, and experience to lend the Leicester dressing room. ‘In the gym and in diet it’s all changed significantly in the last five or so years,’ he says. ‘That’s why I’m still playing, because of those changes.

‘I have done goalkeeping-related weights that still allow you to maintain your flexibility but also build strength and help prevent injuries. It’s stuff that previously I haven’t enjoyed but I’ve turned the corner.

‘I don’t wake up with aches, I don’t get out of bed thinking, “Gosh, I feel 42”. That’s just a number. It’s all about what you can physically do and how you play and perform. That’s all I want to be judged on.’

Schwarzer, with 508 top-flight appearances in English football, will be a vocal presence. ‘To be honest I talk just for the sake of talking,’ he says, laughing.

‘I want to help people. It’s about self-belief. There are going to be times when people make mistakes and it’s not about berating them; it’s about trying to pick them up. We’re going to have to fight as a team.’
