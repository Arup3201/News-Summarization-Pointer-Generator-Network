A German family of evangelical Christians who came to the U.S. in order to legally homeschool their children has appealed a ruling to deport them.

Uwe and Hannelore Romeike are the parents of six children who they wish to home school according their religious beliefs.

Home schooling is against the law in Germany, where all children must attend school.

Denied: The Romeike family, pictured here in front of Cincinnati courthouse, fled Germany in order to continue homeschooling their children and were denied asylum in the U.S. today

The Romeikes fled Germany in 1998 after a German judge threatened legal action if they didn't send their children to school.

They arrived in Tennessee and were initially granted asylum but the government sought to deport the family and an appeals court agreed that the freedom to determine the education of one's children is not a fundamental human right.

The administration also agreed with the German court's finding that banning homeschooling teaches tolerance of diverse views.

Now the family has appealed that decision and is being represented by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in the Supreme Court.

'We are pleased by the Court's interest in the issues we have presented in our petition,' HSLDA Chairman Michael Farris wrote in an email to HSLDA supporters, according to The Christian Post.

'Romeike v. Holder gives the Court an opportunity to address important religious freedom and human rights issues. We hope that after due consideration of the government's brief they will agree to hear our case.'

The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Obama administration to respond to the petition from the HSLDA but there is no guarantee the court will hear the case.The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier ruled that U.S. immigration laws do not grant a safe haven to people 
everywhere who face restrictions that would be prohibited under the 
Constitution and said said Uwe and Hannelore Romeike and family do not 
qualify as 'persecuted,' a prerequisite for asylum.

Many American home-school families and evangelical Christians have taken up the family's cause. A group called the Home School Legal Defense 
Association helped the family's petition to the Obama Administration gain over 100,000 signatures in under 30 days.

In 2008, the Romeikes moved from 
Bissingen an der Teck in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to Morristown 
in eastern Tennessee and applied for asylum.

They faced fines and the threat of losing
custody of their children because they refused to comply with Germany's
compulsory school attendance law.

That request was initially granted by
an immigration judge in 2010. But the Board of Immigration Appeals 
overturned that ruling and the Romeikes appealed to the 6th Circuit.

'The question is not whether Germany's
policy violates the American Constitution, whether it violates the 
parameters of an international treaty or whether Germany's law is a good
idea. It is whether the Romeikes have established the prerequisites of 
an asylum claim - a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a 
protected ground,' the court wrote. 'In this case, that protected ground 
is religious freedom.'

But the court found that the German 
government treats all truants the same, regardless of their reasons for 
not attending school.

Prior to fleeing the country for America, the Romeikes had accrued $9,000 in fines for not having their children in a required school. Criminal charges also await them if and when they are deported to Germany.

The HSLDA, which represented the Romeikes in court, has made a short 
video posted to its website that shows the Romeikes' six children 
studying together at a big table and chasing chickens in the yard.

Danger: Their native Germany does not allow children to be home-schooled and allows the revocation of custody in some cases

Focus on the Romeikes: The family appeared on Mike Huckabee's Fox News program. They became a favorite cause of may conservatives in recent weeks

Mike Donnelly, director of international relations for the association, said the Romeikes planned to appeal.

'The court ignored the evidence that 
Germany targets people for religious or philosophical reasons,' Donnelly
said, referring to a 2003 German Supreme Court decision that found the 
compulsory attendance law served a legitimate government interest of 
counteracting the development of parallel societies.

The 6th Circuit considered this 
argument but dismissed it, stating, 'Any compulsory-attendance law could
be said to have this effect.'

In an April statement, HSLDA called the Obama administration hypocritical for its denial of asylum for the Romeikes.

'The public expects the White House to 
explain the inexplicable,' said the HSLDA's Michael Farris. 'In a season
where the Administration has expressed leniency for millions of 
undocumented immigrants, we are baffled by the extreme attitudes toward 
this one German family.'

Witchcraft: Josua Romeike, 9, left. and Lydia Romeike, 10, right, are taught by father Uwe. Part of why Uwe wants his children out of school is that he believes they teach children witchcraft

Spooky: Hannelore Romeike, described an incident in her seventh grade class where the school taught witchcraft in 'an excercise that involved pushing chairs and glasses around, and dangling a pendulum'

In the petition filed by HSLDA, the organization argued 'every state in the United States of America recognizes the right to homeschool and the U.S. has the worldâ€™s largest and most vibrant homeschool community. Regrettably, this family faces deportation in spite of the persecution they will suffer in Germany.'

Professor David Abraham of the 
University of Miami Law School played the devil's advocate last month on Fox when he argued that homeschooling 
isn't a basic human right, and that the Romeike family isn't entitled to
stay in the United States.

'Homeschooling may be a good idea. It may be a bad idea. It's a public policy question,' Abraham said.

'Not having homeschooling is not being persecuted. Asylum is about persecution.'

'They are not getting something they 
would like,' he insisted. 'that's true for people everywhere, and that's
why we have legislatures.'

Popular: Claiming persecution in Germany, the Romeikes petitioned the White House and received over 100,000 online signatures, but that didn't sway the circuit court's interpretation of asylum law

Not persecuted: Professor David Abraham from the University of Miami Law School (L)agreed that family isn't entitled to political asylum just because the German government has criminalized homeschooling

The U.S. government said in court 
documents the Romeikes did not belong to any particular Christian 
denomination and described the parents' objections to the 
government-approved schools as vague.

For instance, Uwe Romeike claimed a 
textbook 'featured a story suggesting that "the devil can help you if 
you ask the devil, but God would not help you,"' the government said. 
But he could not recall the title of the story or its author.

Romeike also claimed the schools 
taught witchcraft based on a game played by classmates of his wife when 
she was in the seventh grade 'that involved pushing chairs and glasses 
around, and dangling a pendulum.'
