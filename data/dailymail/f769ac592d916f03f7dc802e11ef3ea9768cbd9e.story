Leading doctors warn today of the impact that nearly 13 years in Guantanamo Bay has had on Shaker Aamer’s physical and mental health – and they have demanded his immediate release.

Eminent physicians have signed a letter to the Daily Mail warning of the British resident’s ‘fragile medical condition’. They say there are ‘pressing medical concerns’ about Mr Aamer, who has been held without charge since February 2002.

As the Mail reveals today, in that time he has been beaten at least 315 times.

The doctors point to the conclusions of a medical assessment last year which found Mr Aamer was suffering from serious psychiatric problems and a string of physical ailments.

It concluded he needs urgent psychiatric treatment and ‘reintegration into his family’.

In their letter, the doctors warn that Mr Aamer’s detention is having an ‘appalling effect’ on the health of his British family – especially his wife Zin and their four children.

Crucially, among the signatories are three members of a Foreign Office medical panel which assists British nationals detained overseas, but which has been prevented from discussing Mr Aamer’s case. The letter says Mr Aamer ‘would warrant the assistance of this committee’.

The letter was organised by Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist, human rights activist and member of the Council of the Royal College of Physicians, and is signed by 33 physicians, including professors of neurology and public health, consultants and GPs. All sign in a personal capacity.

The signatories question why there was no mention of Mr Aamer in the explosive US Senate torture report which detailed the horrendous treatment meted out on detainees by the CIA during the ‘War on Terror’.

They write: ‘We would add our names to those who in this newspaper have called for his return to the UK given his fragile medical condition. Further we would be happy to assist in his medical management should this be required.

‘In 2006, we tried to raise this issue with the Foreign Office Pro Bono medical panel – which can assist with medical advice in Britons held overseas. This request, to date, has been rejected, as the Foreign Office does not want to set a precedent for someone who is a British resident, not citizen.’

In April last year, after lengthy legal efforts by Mr Aamer’s lawyers, a doctor conducted the first independent evaluation of his physical and mental state. Dr Emily Keram diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and reported ‘additional psychiatric symptoms related to his current confinement . . . which also gravely diminish his mental health’.

She also noted that ‘the length, uncertainty, and stress of Mr Aamer’s confinement has caused significant disruptions in his . . . ability to function. He is profoundly aware of what he has lost.’ She listed details of a string of physical ailments, including debilitating headaches, asthma, and chronic urinary retention, and called for urgent psychiatric treatment and ‘reintegration into his family’.

The US authorities say Mr Aamer is treated by doctors in Guantanamo. but detainees claim medical care is used by the Guantanamo authorities as an incentive or punishment for behaviour rather than according to medical need.

In correspondence, Mr Aamer has said: ‘Medical care is almost annihilated. They just talk and talk. There is no treatment, just painkillers or sedatives. All medical matters are in the control of the prison administration.’

The Foreign Office has said the Pro Bono panel cannot consider Mr Aamer’s case because although he is a legal resident of this country, he does not have full British citizenship.
