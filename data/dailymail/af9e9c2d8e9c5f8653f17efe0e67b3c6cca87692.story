Authorities are using sonar equipment to search a creek for a pregnant mother-of-four who vanished after going to meet her ex-husband and their daughter.

Melissa Sowders, 26, has not been seen since she dropped off her boyfriend at work last Thursday in Harris County, Texas. The following day, authorities found her truck abandoned on an interstate near Cypress Creek.

Deputies, who said they suspect foul play, will continue their search on Tuesday but her family said they do not expect to find her alive.

Fears: Melissa Sowders, 26, has been missing since last Thursday. The pregnant mother-of-four was going to meet her estranged husband when she vanished and her abandoned car was found the next day

Sowders' boyfriend, Jason Sanford, told police he last saw her when she took him to work at 6.15am on Thursday in their white Honda Accord.

He told deputies that she was supposed to meet her ex-husband and their youngest daughter at a McDonald's - and her family said they fear he could be involved in her disappearance.

'She was terrified of him. Terrified,' Michelle Bierman, Sowders' cousin, told KHOU11 on Monday.

Relatives told the news channel that her estranged husband was abusive towards her and did not like her having a new boyfriend or having a child by him.

Search: Deputies with the Harris County Sheriff Department search wooded area along Cypress Creek on Saturday. They are now also searching the water for any signs of the woman's body

Hunt: Volunteers use sonar equipment to search for the missing mother in the creek

Where's Melissa? They show the reading that has sparked their interest - but will need further investigations

'Pretty much from the first day that we knew she was missing, and the circumstances of how she went missing. We knew. We knew,' Bierman added.

Concerns: Her family says she was terrified of her ex - but police have not named him a suspect

Court records show that the ex-husband, who has custody of their children, actually filed for divorce in October.

Authorities have interviewed the man but have not named him as a suspect.

Volunteers from Texas Equusearch are using boats with sonar equipment at Cypress Creek and said they have already found readings of interest in 12 feet of water.

'We don’t want to leave this water until we know that we’ve absolutely cleared everything,' Tom Miller from Texas Equusearch said.

'I mean, there’s a lot of debris in there. There’s a lot of loose rocks in there. There's a lot of stuff and there's times we get false images but I really want to take a lot closer look at it.'

But he said he was hopeful that Sowders was going to be found.

'I’m very optimistic she’s going to be found,' he said. 'I would hope it's gonna be today. If it’s not…I’m optimistic she’s gonna be found.'

Hopeful: Volunteers with Texas Equusearch, seen Saturday, said they are hopeful she will be found alive

Where is she? They are carrying out searches at Cypress Creek, near to where her car was found

But her family is less positive about her returning to them alive.

'At this point, it’s been too long,' Bierman said. 'It's been too long. The reality is she's not gonna come back alive.'
