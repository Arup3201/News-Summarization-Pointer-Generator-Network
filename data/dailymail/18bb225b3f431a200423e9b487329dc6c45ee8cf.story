An arson douses a cafe with an accelerant before setting it alight in an attack that completely destroyed the shop

The CCTV footage has been released by police in a bid to track down the culprit

'What we want is for the public to study the offender closely, check the time and date of the incident, and attempt to recall any suspicious activity, people or vehicles seen around the Cooleman Court shops around midnight on that date in March,' Mr Hughes said.

'That little bit of important information to Crime Stoppers could help us jump-start this case and identify this arsonist.'

Mark and Melissa Dunphy, who own the Weston based café, told Canberra Times they had only bought the shop seven hours before the attack.

'It's been an absolute disaster,' Mr Dunphy said.

'There have been quite a lot of times where we've laid awake at night and thought, should we just forget about it and just give it up, because it's been too hard.'

'I don't want the arsonist to succeed,' he said.

'I think it's determination to not let them win.'
