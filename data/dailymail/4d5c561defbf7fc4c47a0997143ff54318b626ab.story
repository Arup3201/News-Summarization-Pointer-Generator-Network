A mother whose son and his partner were killed in the Luxor balloon disaster has described the couple as ‘wonderfully creative and sensitive individuals.’

Joe Bampton, 40 and his girlfriend Suzanna Gyetvai, 34, died after the balloon in which they were passengers exploded in flames over Luxor on Tuesday.

Today Maureen Bampton spoke out about the couple who died alongside fellow Brit Yvonne Rennie, 48.

'My son and Zsi were wonderfully 
creative and sensitive individuals who lived life to the full and 
enjoyed being in Clapham Common with their dog Ollie,' she said.

'Joe had worked at Lots Road 
Auctions, Chelsea, as valuer and cataloguer for rugs and carpets since 
leaving the Slade School of Art in the mid-nineties, when he graduated. 

'Zsi  met Joe at  Lots Road Auctions, 
after graduating from Kingston College of Art. She exhibited her silk 
screen prints and etchings under the name of Zsi Chimera. Her most 
recent exhibition in Britain was at the Smokehouse Gallery, Hackney.

She said that would be 'sadly missed by their families, and work colleagues and their many, many good friends.'

Yvonne Rennie's husband Michael, 49,  escaped the burning basket by jumping 10ft to the ground but then was forced to watch as his wife plunged to her death.

Today he issued a statement saying 'Yvonne was my rock, my friend, my 
shoulder to cry on. She was my world. My heartfelt condolences go out to
the other families that have lost relatives around the world in this 
terrible disaster.'

The construction worker is being 
treated in Cairo for burns on his body and was found sobbing in hospital
as the realisation set in that he had lost his wife.

Desperate: With severe burns on his body, he then helplessly ran along a 200 metre dirt track, pictured, to a group of houses to raise the alarm

Survivor: Michael Rennie was airlifted to hospital after he survived the blaze which killed his wife Yvonne

The Egyptian pilot, whose clothes were on fire, leapt out just before Mr Rennie and was the only other survivor.

Mr Rennie ran 250 yards along a track chasing the balloon screaming ‘My wife. My wife’.

But
he could only watch in horror as the doomed craft rose rapidly into the
skies and exploded at 1,000ft above Luxor, then plummeted to the ground
along with its passengers.

Mr Rennie called her Yvonne's father Michael Harris as well as his own father John, 80.

Mr Harris told The Sun: 'He’s a broken man. He broke down when he spoke to me and apologised.

'Nightmare doesn’t describe it.'

Mr Harris told how he believed it was his daughter that had dragged Mr Rennie on to the hot air balloon - he said she was a daredevil who enjoyed an adventure.

Leapt out: The Egyptian pilot, Momen Morad whose clothes were on fire, leapt out just before Mr Rennie and was the only other survivor

Speaking in Britain he said he was 
desperate to know about the last moments of his daughter's life and said
it was possible the couple who married in 2007 had been put in different parts of 
the basket to distribute weight evenly.

Mr Harris added: 'I took her to the airport — I just wish I had brought her home.'

The newspaper also revealed that yesterday the balloon's pilot asked his mother about the death toll as he lay in his hospital bed.

Moaman Abdo, 27, who was left with 70 per cent burns told his mother: 'I can’t believe it, I saw people dying, please tell me no one died.'

Egypt’s Civil Aviation Minister Wael El-Maadawi revealed last night that Mr Adbo leapt from the balloon without shutting off the gas valve to the burner.

Today Tour operator Thomas Cook defended its Egypt balloon trip arrangements amid safety concerns.

Tuesday's flight, was booked with Sky Cruises by a ground agent, Bright Sky Travel, which Thomas Cook contracts to provide various excursions in Egypt.

This morning it was revealed that other 
balloon owners operating in the area were claiming that Bright Sky 
Travel had a reputation for maximising its margins and starving them of 
cash.

Ala Mahmoud, head of Egyptian balloon
company Magic Horizon, accused Thomas Cook of 'not being professional' 
in its dealings with Bright Sky.

He told the Independent newspaper 
that when Thomas Cook hired Bright Sky as its agent three years ago, his
company had been invited to bid for a contract to provide balloon 
flights over Luxor.

He refused after being offered the equivalent of £35 for every £70 ticket.

Mr Mahmoud said: 'The problem is they
are taking so much money. It means the balloon company may not be 
looking for safety or quality, they are just looking for quantity.'

Today Thomas Cook said it insisted 
that local companies offering balloon trips were fully licensed by 
Egypt's aviation authority.

The company added that Sky Cruises had been 'verified and approved by the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority'.

The same balloon, operated by Sky Cruise, had been involved in another crash less than 18 months ago, it was revealed yesterday.

Video footage shot in October 2011 
showed the balloon narrowly missing a hotel roof in Luxor before 
plunging into the Nile. Luckily, all the passengers on board that flight
escaped with nothing worse than bruising.

Yesterday Sky Cruise produced paperwork showing the balloon was checked and certified airworthy in October 2012.

Tuesday’s tragedy is believed to have 
happened near the end of the dawn flight, after a landing rope became 
entangled with a helium gas tube, severing it and sparking a fire.

Mohamed Youssef Mohamed, 27, a pilot for Magic Horizon balloons, was on his own balloon at the time.

‘One of my tourists on board pointed 
out that the balloon appeared to have caught fire on the right-hand 
side,’ he said. ‘It was just two or three metres from the ground and was
about to land but the pilot was quickly engulfed in flames and flung 
himself out of the basket.

‘Seconds later, on the other edge of 
the basket, the British survivor jumped out. By the time it reached 70 
metres I saw four people fall – I’m not sure if they jumped or if the 
basket opened due to the fire. This was all before the sound of the gas 
explosion.’

The whole incident took a little over 
two minutes. Another witness, a holiday worker called Mohamed, said: ‘It
was a horrific sight. The scene was pure hysteria. The pilot Momen 
Murad was a professional with around 10 years of experience flying hot 
air balloons and was well known in Luxor as a skilled flier.’

An investigation is underway by Egyptian authorities and all balloon flights have been grounded.

Ahmed Mohamed Al Yemeni, Luxor’s 
deputy public prosecutor  who is in charge of investigating the 
incident, said: ‘Investigators are searching for evidence of a technical
malfunction of a gas canister used. It appears likely the gas was 
largely responsible for the accident.’

Yesterday Mr Rennie’s brother David 
complained that he had ‘not been told anything’ by Thomas Cook, the tour
operator used by the four Britons. He said he could not speak about the
disaster until he had seen his brother, who works for a construction 
company, but the family ‘were grieving for our loss of Yvonne’.

Mrs Rennie joined the radiology department of Perth Royal Infirmary as an appointments officer in June 2006.

Radiology manager Douglas Mitchell said: ‘We are in shock at the sudden and tragic loss of Yvonne.

‘She was a much-loved colleague who 
enjoyed her job and her tragic passing has had a huge impact on all of 
us who knew and worked with her. She will be sadly missed.’ Mr Bampton 
and Miss Gyetvai both worked for Lots Road Auctions in Chelsea.

They were described by their neighbours as ‘a quiet, lovely couple’.

Investigation: An Egyptian inspector of the Civil Aviation Authority walks among the wreckage. Shocked eye-witnesses told yesterday how the pilot and a number of passengers jumped from balloon at around 300ft as it was being towed into land and hit a power line
