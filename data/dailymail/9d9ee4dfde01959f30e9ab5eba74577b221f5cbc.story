Murderous prison gangs in an overcrowded jail in the state of Maranhão, north eastern Brazil, left 10 dead and 30 injured in a violent uprising on Thursday.

Rioting broke out in the Pedrinhas Penitentiary Complex in the city of São Luis between rival factions  and spilled out into the city centre, where marauding supporters torched seven buses and besieged the local hospital.

The mutiny started after several prisoners refused to allow wardens to carry out an inspection of their cells. The situation rapidly escalated into a confrontation between the officers and the detainees.

'The uprising began after wardens discovered that 60 prisoners were digging a tunnel through which they intended to escape,' said Aluísio Mendes, secretary of public security in Maranhão.

'When prison officials tried to access the block, the prisoners rebelled.'

The standoff sparked fierce clashes between opposing prison mobsters and spiralled out of control as inmates went on a killing spree.

Rioters set fire to the prison blocks as special elite shock troops were sent in to contain the situation. Guns, homemade bombs and other lethal weapons were found inside the jail which was built to hold 400 but currently detains over 600 inmates.

A representative from the Commission on Human Rights for Brazil’s legal profession, Diogo Cabral, who was present as an observer at the scene said:  'I am very shocked at what happened.  If the shock troops had been dispatched earlier maybe the barbarism and the death toll could have been avoided.'

Anger: A relative hurls stones at the prison in frustration amid chaotic scenes outside

Relatives and onlookers outside the prison, waiting developments, reacted angrily by throwing stones in an attempt to break into the jail. In the city centre, gangs linked to the prisoners set fire to seven buses after ordering passengers off.

The local hospital where the injured were transferred to had to be manned with extra police as mobs threatened to invade the complex.

In a statement, a state government spokesperson linked the rebellion to the apprehension a few days before of  39 people during a party at a beach house in Araçagi to celebrate the birthday of a drug dealer known as ‘Babs’.

Rival gang members were accused of using the mayhem to carry out revenge attacks and killings.

Police officers have been involved in an ongoing campaign to break up gangs in the area, which is riven with regular turf wars and violent clashes between the largest gang known as Tram 40, and its opposition the PCM.

Brazil is due to host next year's World Cup. Maranhao is nearly 1,000km away from Fortaleza, one of the closest host cities,  which is on Brazil's north east coastline.

An earlier outbreak of violence on Tuesday this week left three prisoners dead during a transfer of 18 detainees at the same penitentiary. One was decapitated.

Two other inmates and one prison guard were wounded. The mutiny ended the same day with the arrival of the elite troops.

In April 2011, inmates were involved in one of the largest and bloodiest rebellions that lasted about 30 hours in the São Luis penal complex.

The revolt left 18 dead, three of them by beheading. Five prison guards were held hostage.

At one point police attempting to break into the site were held back by the convicts who threw two severed heads over the wall.

The criminals had gone on the rampage demanding better treatment saying the food wasn’t fit for human consumption and the water was polluted and rank.
