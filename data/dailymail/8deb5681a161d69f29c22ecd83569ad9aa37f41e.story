The FBI ran a child pornography service for two weeks last year, distributing images of children being raped and abused online to around 5,000 customers.

A Seattle FBI agent has admitted the controversial technique in statements to court, and claimed it was used in an effort to catch out pedophiles signed up to the service.

It is understood to be the first time the Bureau has actually dealt child porn as part of a sting, though agents have posed as child porn dealers in the past.

Child protection advocates are likely to be outraged by the revelation, as federal prosecutors often claim that each time an image of rape or molestation is shared, the child is abused again.

Controversial: The FBI ran a child pornography service for two weeks last year, distributing images of children being raped and abused online to around 5,000 customers

Known only as 'Website A,' the Nebraska-based child pornography service was described in an April 10 search warrant affidavit as an online bulletin board with the primary business of advertising and sharing child pornography.

The affidavit was obtained by Seattlepi.com earlier this month but has since been sealed, the news website reported.

The document described how agents in the Omaha area seized the site on November 16, 2012 and continued to operate it, while also monitoring graphic and disturbing messages among users, until December 2, 2012.

At least 10,000 photos of children being raped, abused or forced to pose naked were broadcast through 'Website A,' according to Seattlepi.com. It had more than 5,600 registered users and 24,000 posts when it was finally shut down on December 2.

The FBI told MailOnline it couldn't discuss the case or its decision to continue operating the website because the investigation was ongoing.

'This remains an ongoing investigation, and local court rules and Department of Justice policy prohibit me from providing more information at this time,' said FBI Omaha Division spokeman Sandy Breault. 'As in any given matter, if charges are filed, they will eventually become a matter of public record.'

However, according to Seattlepi.com, court records suggest investigators resorted to running the ring after they were unable to trace customers through the service's records.

While no charged have been laid in the case, information garnered from the investigation has reportedly led agents to one Western Washington home, which was searched on April 10.

The study found access to porn can lead to young people engaging in ¿risky behaviours¿ such as unprotected anal sex and the use of drugs and alcohol during sex

The suspect is alleged to have accessed a 'jailbait' girls section of the website, specifically two men raping a pre-teen girl. He hasn't yet been charged and it's unclear what data was uncovered on computers seized from the property.

The Seattle agent's statement reveals users often bragged about images of children being sexually assaulted by multiple men.

'There have been over 7,850 views of this thread in less than a week, which is a great compliment to the girls!' one user wrote, according to Seattlepi.com, which viewed the search warrant.

'However, I find it hard to believe than(sic) in the last century and a half since photography was invented, it hasn't occurred to more people that to photograph a cute little girl being hard (expletive) by two men is a fine and arousing thing to do.'

In another thread, users chatted casually about their desire to rape children sown in a series of pornographic images. 'Jesus I would enjoy hurting that child,' a user said in the chat thread, the search warrant affidavit revealed.

According to Seattlepi.com, court records fail to show how many images of raped and abused children were shared or accessed on the website while it was under FBI control.

Investigators also do not state whether abused children whose pictures were accessed and swapped by pedophiles during the investigation were notified by the FBI.
