Police have cordoned off a church graveyard after a severed human ear was found on the floor by a man who had taken his dog for an evening stroll.

The local walker dialled 999 last night after making the grim discovery in the grounds of St Mary's Church in Aylesbury,Â  Buckinghamshire

Thames Valley police say investigations are continuing and experts are analysing the body part.

Grim: A local man was walking his dog when he found the body part, which is now being analysed

The ear was found by Ben Jackson-Smith who was walking his pet Staffordshire Bull Terrier Kas.

Mr Jackson Smith said he noticed Kas
was sniffing at something during their usual walk around the graveyard 
amongst the older headstones.

'I didn't think much of it and kicked
it into the bushes but then saw she had gone back for it and it was in 
her mouth,' the 21-year-old said.

'It just didn't look right. It was 
that colour of pigs trotters in a butcher's, so I picked it up in a dog 
bag and took it back to the flat.'

He said after examining it and he thought the police had better become involved.

'However, I said to them it might not be an ear and just to come when they could.'

St Mary's Church is a modern Catholic Church and described on its website as 'the heart of the community.'

St Mary's Rector Shane Wood said: 'I walked into the churchyard this morning with police carrying out a full investigation.

'They were searching the church grounds and have now brought in sniffer dogs to make sure they haven't missed anything.

'I've been told it was a human ear. It must be or the police wouldn't be going to all this trouble,' he said.

'We
are all shocked by this discovery. There are 150 residents in the 
vicinity of the church and it's a complete mystery as to what has 
happened.

'You don't expect this sort of thing. It's like something out of Midsomer Murders,' he said.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed the ear was found in the undergrowth and had now been sent away for analysis.

'Police were called at 6.37pm (on Wednesday) by a man who was walking his dog and discovered what he believed was a human ear.

'Investigations are currently ongoing and a scene watch is in place at this time.'
