Each night, when the floodlights are switched on at the Hale End academy in Walthamstow, the next generation of Arsenal hopefuls rush out of various meeting rooms and head for the playing surfaces.

Sometimes David Beckham is there, or his mum Sandra, smiling at Brooklyn, Romeo or Cruz as they rush past to join in with the various age groups.

Frank Lampard Snr’s grandson, a nifty little midfielder, is also making his way through the academy in Arsenal’s colours. But this is not about celebrity and no-one is at Hale End to make up the numbers.

Under the club’s new academy manager Andries Jonker, who was recruited last season to replace Liam Brady after his retirement, Arsenal believe they can shape the future of English football.

Standards are high and the target is to develop players who will one day take the place of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez or Danny Welbeck.

If they do, it will be done at a fraction of the cost.

Suddenly there is a determination about the place to produce some special players, technically and physically proficient enough to bring them through the system with some modern coaching methods.

Jonker was introduced to Arsenal supporters last night, interviewed in the matchday programme after settling in to his new role.

‘I have come into another culture, another society in England and another football society, which is typical here and different to other countries,’ was one of his first observations.

It is Jonker’s job to realign Arsenal’s youth teams with the best teams on the continent.

When Brady left at the end of last season, Jonker was invited to the former academy director’s farewell BBQ with staff from the club. He said just two words: ‘Improve it.’

That is the ambition around the place, with a new voice dedicating to bringing through the next generation of players who can fit in to the Arsenal way.

When the young players arrive for the start of their three-hour long training session, they are taken aside and told what will be expected of them that evening. Game intelligence is key.

Jonker, a Dutch coach with experience of working alongside Louis van Gaal at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, is driving this project home.

There was a time when the academy system in English football was ruled by the biggest boys. Arsenal want their players to have the biggest brains, cultivating them with first class coaching and encouraging to pick up the habits that can lead to a career in the game.

On the continent, as Jonker conceded in his interview, they are streets ahead in terms of developing players at youth level.

Arsenal are doing their bit to change it, taking the responsibility of bringing English players through. Good on them for that.

Arsenal have brought through some greats, such as Tony Adams, Brady, Ashley Cole and Paul Merson as well as Jack Wilshere in the current side, but the sport has changed, with tactics, systems and emotional intelligence playing an increasing part in the modern game.

Arsenal, under the guidance of Jonker and his Dutch assistants Frans de Kat and Jan van Loon, are adapting to the demands.

They know the kids watch YouTube or play FIFA on their PlayStations, picking up the skills refined by Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, or even Thierry Henry during his time as an Arsenal player.

The biggest problem is converting the ability, teaching players when to lay off the ball and when to pull out Zidane’s La Roulette trick, Cruyff’s legendary turn or Maradona’s twisting runs.

Most players can learn these skills over time, but working out when to use them, at the very highest levels in youth football, is a lot tougher. At Arsenal, they want it ingrained.

This is a new philosophy, a new approach. The squads are streamlined and some of the groups have as few as 10 kids.

The young players, those who have yet to hit their teens, spend more time practising one-on-one drills, two-on-one or three-on-two to give them more time working with the ball and learning how to win it back.

They are too young to absorb too much information about game intelligence, particularly after a long day at school.

The older kids can soak up a bit more, listening intently and learning how to play the game. Every position on the field has minimum expectations and Arsenal’s young players must adapt to these principles.

Most of the kids have come straight from school, sometimes an hour long journey away and ferried to east London by their parents.

On the sidelines, they have to keep the peace. Shouting is not tolerated at Hale End.

The guidance and instruction is for the coaches, explaining each session to the kids before it is delivered in a series of pre-planned exercises.

The FA, who are watching closely, hope Arsenal can crack it.
