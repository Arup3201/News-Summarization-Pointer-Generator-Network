This is the £900,000 mansion which will become home to a newly-appointed bishop in a controversial move away from his traditional historic palace.

The Right Reverend Peter Hancock, 58, will be one of the first Bishop of Bath and Wells in recent years to live outside the Bishop’s Palace in Wells, Somerset, which was built in 1210.

Parts of the stunning moated property - which sits in 14 acres in the shadow of Wells Cathedral - are open to the public and church chiefs wanted somewhere with “more privacy”.

So they are buying an impressive Grade II-listed Georgian former rectory - set within its own walled grounds - to be his new residence.

The sale of the imposing Old Rectory in Croscombe is yet to be completed, but church commissioners have confirmed the four-bed home has been chosen for the bishop and his wife Jane.

However, some local residents believe the palace “comes with the job” and the Bishop’s move will diminish the significance of the building.

Nick Wride said: “Having a resident bishop gives a prestige to the palace and encourages more visitors as well as providing a better spiritual connection for those attending the religious services.“As it is no longer to be the Bishop’s Palace what are we going to call it - The ex-bishop’s Palace?

“As usual the Church is out of touch with the people it is there to support and tends to forget that without us there would be no Church nor commissioners, just more faceless people sitting in ivory towers with spread sheets for another soulless and empty historic tourist attraction.”

Palace volunteer steward Rosie Inge said: “I’m angry that no one seems to have been consulted about this.

“I think living in the palace goes with the job. If you take the bishop out of the palace then the life will be removed and it will be just another historic building.”

The Old Rectory in Croscombe boasts a host of period details including huge shuttered sash windows, picture rails and pretty ceiling roses, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms upstairs.

Dual-aspect dining and drawing rooms make the most of the surrounding countryside and the property boasts two halls and underground cellars.

The Bishop’s Palace has been a regular home to the Bishops of Bath and Wells since the mid 1850s.

Andrew Brown, secretary to the Church Commissioners, said: “The decision to move the bishop’s home will mean he can live in more privacy as the palace and gardens will remain open to the public.“The Bishop will continue to work and worship at the Palace and share the office with the Bishop of Taunton.”

Sarah Moore, visitor services manager at the Palace, said the Bishop did not make the decision to move.

She added: “The rich story of The Bishop’s Palace is ever evolving and it is an opportunity for us in 2014 to look at new ways of sharing surprising and fascinating details about the relationship that bishops past and present have had with the City of Wells and the Palace.

“We are eagerly anticipating the arrival of Bishop Peter and his wife, Jane to the Diocese. We know that it was not his decision to live elsewhere and we look forward to warmly welcoming him in 2014.

“We are confident that The Bishop’s Palace will never be ‘just another historic building’ - the strength of its unique past, present and future will not allow for that to happen.”
