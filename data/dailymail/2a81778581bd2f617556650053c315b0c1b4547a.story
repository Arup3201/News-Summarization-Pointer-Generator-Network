A married middle school teacher was given a long seven-year prison sentence on Monday, after admitting to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students. 

Sarah Raymo, 32, was arrested last January after rumors started swirling around Bay City, Michigan's T.L. Handy Middle School that she was sleeping with one of her eighth-grade students. 

The unidentified victim testified eight months ago that he had sex with Raymo six to eight times, both in school and at her home. 

The teacher, who appears to have been married at the time of her arrest early this year, was set to go to trial in late September, but instead took a plea deal and admitted guilt to two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct to have four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct dropped.

On Monday, a circuit court judge sentenced Raymo to 7.5 to 15 years in prison  calling her inappropriate relationship with a minor student 'horrendous'. The maximum prison term for the charges is 15 years in prison. 

As she received her sentence, Raymo  started shaking and breathing heavily, while wiping away tears, MLive.com reported. She declined to make a statement.

'As a teacher, you're placed in a position of trust over your students,' Circuit Court Judge Kenneth W Schmidt said. 'That trust was violated when you elected to freely and willingly have sex with one of your students, no matter what the circumstances were surrounding your acceptance of the fact that you were going to have sex with this young man. The victim has been greatly impacted by this. He switched schools and is seeking therapy.

'Taking everything into consideration and including the fact that you violated the trust placed in you as a teacher of students, particularly the age of these students — we're talking about eighth grade — the higher end of the guidelines is appropriate,' judge Schmidt added. 

However, Raymo's defense attorney  Matthew Reyes believes the judge made a mistake in the sentencing. 

'It's just wrong. I don't feel the judge knows the file like I do,' Reyes said. 'She's probably not ready for what's ahead.' 

Reyes agrees that  what his client did is wrong, but he doesn't see her actions as predatory behavior. 

In a statement,  Reyes explained that while the victim could not consent to sex with Raymo because of his age, he did initiate the relationship with letters of a sexual nature.

The victim allegedly started speaking to his teacher through classroom journals, which then transitioned to a text message conversation. 

After that, Raymo asked the student to stay after school one day and then the two had sex in her classroom.  The relationship was exposed when the student started telling fiends about the affair and it spread around school.

'I acknowledge that the victim is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, but the victim is not incapable of initiating sexual conversations,' Reyes said. 

The parents of the victim did not attend the sentencing hearing, but Chief Assistant Prosecutor Nancy E Borushki read a prepared statement on their behalf. 

'What is very clear to the parents of the victim and to myself is that this is somebody who took advantage of their child. There has been much said out there about how lucky the victim is, and that this is not a big deal, but this is a big deal to not only the victim, but also his parents,' the statement read.

'This crime is a crime of selfishness and a betrayal of trust... she used a student and she used a child to satisfy whatever selfish needs or issues that she was trying to address. I think it's important not only to the parents, but to the victim in this case, and the community at large that when you betray trust in this fashion that there should be a severe penalty.' 

According to an online wedding registry on the site TheKnot, Dominowski married Christopher Raymo in September 2012 in Essexville. 

The woman's husband and mother appeared at her arraignment in January, but it's unclear if she is still married to her husband.
