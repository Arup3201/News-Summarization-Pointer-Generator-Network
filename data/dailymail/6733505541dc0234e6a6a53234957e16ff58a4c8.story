Ray Rice wasted no time celebrating his NFL reinstatement and headed to Manhattan nightclubs just hours after winning his appeal, photographs have revealed.

The former Ravens running back was spotted at Bounce Sporting Club on Saturday evening, where he was happy to chat with people and give out autographs, according to TMZ.

Sources told the website that he was also joined by his wife Janay, whom he knocked out in an Atlantic City casino in February, but she did not appear in any of the images.

TMZ added that people at the club noted that Rice was not drinking. He swore off hard liquor after revealing that the vicious attack unfolded on an alcohol-fueled night.

Rice's one-punch knockout of his then fiancée put his NFL career in jeopardy and thrust the issue of domestic abuse into the national spotlight.

The first video of the fight that went viral in February showed Rice calmly pulling an unconscious Palmer from the elevator and he was suspended for two games.

But after TMZ obtained a second video taken inside the elevator - which showed Rice knocking her out  - he was released by the Ravens and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him indefinitely from the league.

However, an independent arbitrator on Friday said that Rice, in essence, was sanctioned twice for the same crime and ruled he was free to sign with any National Football League team.

The NFL said it accepted the decision, spokesman Greg Aiello said.

'Ray Rice is a free agent and has been eligible to be signed by an NFL team since he was released by the Ravens,' he said. 'Based on Judge Jones' decision, he will be eligible to play upon signing a new contract.' 

In a statement, Rice said:  'I would like to thank Judge Barbara Jones, the NFL Players Association, my attorneys, agents, advisers, family, friends and fans - but most importantly, my wife Janay.

'I made an inexcusable mistake and accept full responsibility for my actions. I am thankful that there was a proper appeals process in place to address this issue. I will continue working hard to improve myself and be the best husband, father and friend, while giving back to my community and helping others to learn from my mistakes.' 

In an interview with the Today show, Janay Rice stood up for her husband and insisted that he had never hit her prior to their fight in the New Jersey casino elevator.

'There's no way,' she said in the interview that aired on Monday. 'He knows what he would have to deal with. I'm not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me and, God forbid, in front of my child.'

After the incident, she said that she initially thought she was 'done' with Rice - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him because it was not like him. 

'Everybody makes mistakes,' she said. 'You would think that we lived in a country of people who have never made a mistake, who've never sinned ever in their life.' 

While Rice is now free to join any club, it remains unclear if any team will sign the 27-year-old, three-time Pro Bowl running back.
