There can't be many levels of excitement that can be greater than three-year-old James Blakeman's when he hears the opening strains of John Williams' famous Star Wars theme.

Purist fans of George Lucas's films will be delighted little James' dad Sam Blakeman, 33, is introducing his son to the legendary science-fiction franchise starting with A New Hope, the original 1977 release.  'Was there any other option?' he says. 

But not as pleased as Wigan-based Sam is that his young man has such fine taste. 

'What's this dad?' asks James as the movie begins. Asked what he thinks it is, James thinks for a moment before saying enthusiastically, 'Storm Woopers, and the people!'

He's so close to Storm Troopers we all know what he means, and Sam says the only reason he gets it wrong is 'I haven't corrected him on that one yet'. It's so cute, who can blame him?

As the famous tune kicks into gear, James' reaction escalates apace with arm waving and jumping, no doubt influenced by his dad's mutual appreciation of what's to come. James most certainly approves. 

'I like it!' he says. 

The look on the face of James Blakeman when he sees the start of Star Wars: A New Hope is priceless

'StormWoopers,' James proclaims - he only doesn't say Stormtroopers because dad Sam hasn't told him to

'Is it exciting?' Sam asks, and gets a repeated response in the affirmative. 

'There's a space ship!' James says, becoming increasingly excited. 

Incredibly, James hasn't even seen the whole film yet.

'This was the first time,' Sam says. 'He has seen clips and trailers on YouTube and his sister Phoebe has seen A New Hope, so he has seen bits of it whilst she was watching. He hasn't made it through the whole film yet as his attention span can't last that long.'

James jumps around and laughs with great enthusiasm as John Williams' famous score plays

James is also a massive fan of the Disney Pixar films Monsters Inc and Monsters University but Sam says 'nothing else gets such a reaction' as A New Hope, the first of six Stars Wars films by Lucas featuring the Princess Leia-led Rebel Alliance in their attempt to destroy the Death Star. 

But while James enjoys the Stormtroopers - sorry, StormWoopers - he's yet to be fully introduced to their evil leader Darth Vader. 

'He doesn't seem that fazed by Darth Vader but again he hasn't seen much of Darth's antics yet and I'm conscious of his age not to spook him too soon,' Sam says.
