 Afraid of ghosts? Afraid of being naked? Now you can combine both these fears into one giant scream fest.

Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania is opening its first 'haunted scream park that is meant to expose participants to 'a new kind of fear.'In an event called Shoctoberfest adventurous crowds are invited to take the 'naked and scared' challenge based on a hit show on the Discovery Channel called, 'naked and afraid.'

Pennsylvania's "premier haunted scream park" will open this week with a naked haunted house

The naked haunted house in Pennsylvania will test people's fear of more than ghosts

A group of brave participants will be able to explore a haunted house--entirely naked. Participants are invited to take their clothes off (only if they feel comfortable doing so) in a 'semi private' space and will be lead naked with a bunch of strangers into a haunted house.

Once participants have been scared out of their skin, they are then led out into a courtyard to put their clothes back on--if they make it that far.

Minors are not allowed to participate and haunted house tours are not held on Sundays.

Oh, and there is a disclaimer:

'Shocktoberfest has created this experience so their customers can explore a new level of fear. This is about fear and pushing oneself out of their comfort zone. This is not about sex. No sexual misconduct, inappropriate or disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.Please note there is an additional cleaning charge if we scare the p*ss out of you!'

Tickets can be bought online for $20. Attire for the festivity is 'nude or prude.'
