Labour MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland Ian Lavery, who claims Ed Miliband's inner circle think people with northern accents are stupid 

Ed Miliband’s inner circle think people with Northern accents are stupid, a Labour MP has claimed.

Prominent Left-winger Ian Lavery said the party’s elite looked down on working-class supporters in the North.

The Wansbeck MP, a former miner, said: ‘We’ve got an elite in Westminster which quite frankly frightens me.

‘They haven’t been anywhere or done anything, and when you’ve got an accent like mine they think, “well that man doesn’t really know too much”.’

His broadside follows claims by Tony Blair that Mr Miliband is leading the party to defeat.

Mr Lavery, a former president of the National Union of Mineworkers who took part in the 1984-85 strike, spoke out at a conference organised by left-wing think-tank CLASS.

He said too few of the Labour hierarchy in Westminster have done manual jobs, adding: ‘Sadly there’s not enough MPs who’ve actually worked on the coalface, on the factory floor.’

Last night Mr Lavery insisted his comments were about the need for more working-class MPs and ‘in no way a criticism’ of Mr Miliband or his office.

He added in a statement: ‘For the record, I believe Ed Miliband is absolutely the right man to bring in policies that will be of great benefit to people in the North and across the country.’

However, his comments come as Labour MPs fight over the direction of the party following the critique by Mr Blair – who last night quickly backtracked over his remarks.

In a swift U-turn, the former Labour PM gave Mr Miliband his full support – just hours after saying he expects the Labour leader to lose the election. 

Mr Blair sparked a backlash after warning that the party had been dragged to the Left and is on course for disaster at the polls. 

But he was forced to issue a denial within hours, saying his comments had been ‘misinterpreted’. 

He added on Twitter: ‘I fully support Ed and my party and expect a Labour victory in the election.’ Charlie Whelan, a former spin doctor for Gordon Brown, responded: ‘Don’t be surprised if no one believes you.’

Mr Blair had angered Labour high command after telling The Economist that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’.

Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’ But his intervention was a blow to the Labour leader, who is struggling to convince his own party that he can win the election.

Blairite MP David Lammy yesterday said it was right to raise concerns about Labour’s direction and insisted Mr Blair’s comments should be taken ‘very seriously indeed’.

But Lucy Powell, Mr Miliband’s election chief, yesterday dismissed the warning. Referring to Mr Blair, she said: ‘He has his experience from his era. That is not the era we now live in.’

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, described Mr Blair’s views as ‘sad and disappointing’. Veteran Labour MP David Winnick said Mr Blair should remember the Clement Attlee quip ‘a period of silence on your part would be welcome’.

A Labour victory in this year’s general election would spark economic ‘chaos’, David Cameron warns today.

The Prime Minister will use his New Year message to say Labour’s addiction to borrowing poses ‘huge risks’ to an economy that is now on the mend – as experts predict wages are finally set to outstrip inflation this year.

The Institute of Directors expects pay to rise by an average of 2 to 3 per cent in the next 12 months as company balance sheets improve. Meanwhile, the Centre for Economics and Business Research will today forecast that average prices could start to fall for the first time since 1960 because of the impact of cheaper oil.

In his message, Mr Cameron will say Britain’s progress is at grave risk if Ed Miliband seizes power in May – either outright or as part of a coalition government.

In a plea for a second term, he will claim the UK is being ‘turned around’ by the Tories, adding: ‘Britain has a choice between the competence that has got us this far or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.’
