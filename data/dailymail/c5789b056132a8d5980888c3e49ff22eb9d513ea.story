Emre Can was spotted leaving Liverpool's Melwood training ground on crutches as he continues his recovery from injury.

The 20-year-old midfielder, who signed from Bayer Leverkusen this summer, rolled his ankle while on international duty with the German Under 21s.

Horst Hrubesch's side routed Romania 8-0 in the UEFA Under 21 Championship, but by the time Can picked up the injury the Germans had already used all of their substitutes and so he was forced to play on and could now be out for five-six weeks.

Brendan Rodgers found his side further depleted after the international break when Joe Allen and Daniel Sturridge also picked up injuries.

Allen fell victim to Andorra's poorly maintained 3G pitch when playing for Wales and missed Liverpool's defeat by Aston Villa at the weekend.

Sturridge was also absent for that loss after picking up an injury in England's friendly against Norway.

Rodgers confirmed the 25-year-old could be out for up to three weeks and is likely to miss the Merseyside derby at the end of the month.

Next up for Liverpool is their first Champions League game since 2009. They take on Bulgarian side Ludogrets on Tuesday at Anfield in a group that also includes European champions Real Madrid and Swiss title holders Basle.
