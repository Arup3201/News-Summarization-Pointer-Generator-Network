Opponents may say some of his policy ideas are on the thin side, but George Osborne is doing his utmost to make sure his hair is not.

The Chancellor was yesterday seen sporting a new style, with his hair brushed forward to cover up signs of a receding hairline.

The choppy, layered cut is used by hairdressers to make it seem as though their clients’ hair is thicker than it really is, in turn helping them look younger.

It seems to have worked for Mr Osborne. The new style appeared to have taken a few years off the 42-year-old, who was seen in June with thin and greying hair.

Mr Osborne was speaking to Lloyds Banking staff in Birmingham after the sale of taxpayer-owned shares.

The Chancellor has hailed the £61million profit on the sale of the shares as more evidence the economy was 'turning a corner'.

Mr Osborne claimed the £3.2 billion sale of a 6 per cent slice of the bank to institutional investors represented a half-billion pound boost to the public accounts - because of the way it is valued on the Government's books.

He indicated that the disposal of the rest of the Treasury's holding, now standing at 32.7 per cent, may be opened up to the public in a stock market float likely to revive memories of the major privatisations of the 1980s.

It comes five years to the day after then-Lloyds TSB stepped in to swallow up troubled Halifax Bank of Scotland during the financial crisis in a disastrous move that saw it needing to be rescued itself in a £20 billion Government bail-out.

The first tranche of the re-privatisation saw financial institutions mainly from the UK and United States snap up stock at a price of 75p per share, above the 73.6p average price that had been paid for it by the Treasury.

Talk: The new style appeared to have taken a few years off Mr Osborne, 42, who was seen in June with thin and greying hair

In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Osborne said: 'This is a good outcome for the taxpayer.

'It represents a major milestone on the road from rescue to recovery for the British economy, and in further normalising the banking sector.

'This is the first in a multi-staged sale programme. I will consider all options for later sales of our shareholding in Lloyds, including a retail offering to the general public.'
