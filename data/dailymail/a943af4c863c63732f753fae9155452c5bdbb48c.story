David Cameron's former spin doctor Andy Coulson and ex-News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks appeared in court today to face charges linked to alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

Brooks, 44, appeared first, along with former Sun chief reporter John Kay, 69, and Ministry of Defence employee Bettina Jordan-Barber, 39.

Brooks, from Churchill, Oxfordshire, and Kay, from north west London, are accused of conspiring to pay Jordan-Barber around £100,000 for information.

Prosecutors allege Brooks and Kay plotted to pay Jordan-Barber in bribes to hand over sensitive Ministry of Defence information which fuelled a series of exclusives in The Sun between January 2004 and January this year.

'All three defendants are jointly charged on one allegation of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office', said prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron.

'On the back of confidential information, Mr Kay wrote more than 60 articles published in The Sun.

'In exchange for information, it is alleged Ms Jordan-Barber was paid £100,000 in cash over the course of more than 30 separate transactions between 2004 and 2011.'

They spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and addresses during the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

Wearing a black jacket and tan trousers, Brooks sat next to Kay, who was in a grey suit with a white shirt and blue tie.

Both were charged with one count of conspiracy.

Jordan-Barber, who is from Shrivenham near Swindon, sat apart from the pair in the dock wearing a black dress and pink shirt.

She was charged with a wilful misconduct in judicial/public office.

Jordan-Barber made a bid for her home address to be kept private on the grounds she would suffer media intrusion, but the application was dismissed.

The three were accused of plotting together between January 1 2004 and January 31 this year.

They were all released on unconditional bail until they next appear at Southwark Crown Court on December 6.

Coulson and ex-News of the World (NOTW) royal correspondent Clive Goodman appeared afterwards.

They are charged with conspiracy to pay for information including a royal phone directory known as the 'Green Book'.

It contained contact details for the Royal Family and members of their households.

Coulson, 44, from Kent, and Goodman, 55, from Surrey, face two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office - one between August 31 2002 and January 31 2003, and the other between January 31 and June 3 2005.

They relate to the alleged request and authorisation of payments to public officials in exchange for information, including the royal contacts book.

'The allegation is that Mr Coulson and Mr Goodman conspired with persons unknown to acquire the Royal telephone directory', said Mr Bryant-Heron.

Coulson, who wore a grey suit, white shirt and blue tie, and Goodman, who was in a dark suit with a blue shirt and purple tie, were both released on unconditional bail until the same date as the other three defendants.

The charges are the first brought by the Met Police since they launched Operation Elveden, investigating alleged corruption of public officials by journalists.

Brooks resigned from her post as chief executive in July 2011 in the wake of the phone hacking scandal which forced the closure of the News of the World.

Coulson quit as editor of the paper in 2007, and was forced to resign as Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications guru in 2010 after allegations of phone hacking under his watch were made.

Kay joined in The Sun in 1974 and went on to serve as chief reporter for 21 years until 2011.

He was named Reporter of the Year twice by the British Press Association.

Jordan-Barber was a strategy officer at the Ministry of Defence at the time of her arrest, having worked on the Iraq desk and briefed the Secretary of State.

The sprawling inquiry into claims 
officials were bribed for information emerged in the aftermath of the 
phone-hacking scandal, which has its own inquiry, Operation Weeting.
