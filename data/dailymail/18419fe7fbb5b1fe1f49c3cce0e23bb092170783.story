Dog owners could be arrested and subjected to 74 lashes if they are caught taking their pet for a walk or keeping one in their home under a proposed Iranian law.

A bill presented by 32 members of the Iranian Parliament  claimed that owning a dog as a pet harms the country's Islamic culture because of their 'uncleanliness'.

Violators could be arrested if they are caught accompanying their pet in public and forced to pay a fine of up to 100 million rials, around £2,243, or receive 74 lashes.

Unwelcome pets could also be confiscated and transferred to a zoo or desert, according to the bill. 

An excerpt of the bill released by France-based opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran, said: 'Anyone who takes a pet like a monkey or a dog in public and damages the Islamic culture or the health and tranquility of the people - particularly children and women, or attempts to buy or sell them, or keep them at their house, and not to act on the warnings issued by State Security Forces (police), would be fined between 10 to 100 million rials or would receive 74 lashes, plus the pet would be confiscated.'

The law will  exempt police officers, farm owners, sheep herders and fishermen.

Dog ownership has been frowned upon over the past years from authorities who criminalise its owners and deem it as an imitation of Western culture.

Animal supporters regard the rule as a crackdown on youth and an attempt to suppress freedoms in the conservative country.

The Iranian regime has already banned drivers travelling with pets in their cars.

In 2011, authorities threatened to criminalise dog ownership and said the growing popularity of keeping the pets 'poses a cultural problem, blind imitation of the vulgar Western culture'.

In June 2010 Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirzi warned that dog ownership would lead to family corruption and damage societal values.

'Many people in the West love their dogs more than their wives and children,' he said.

The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance then banned all media from publishing adverts about pets, according to AFP.
