A council worker who was found with 352 computer discs containing terrorist material, including footage of executions and the 9/11 attacks, was today jailed for two years.

London Borough of Hackney revenue officer Khalid Baqa, 48, also used his work computer to watch the footage and trawl Islamic websites.

He stashed the discs - which contained 26 hours of speeches by the hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki - in his car and his children’s bedroom.

The disks contained documents written by hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured) who was killed in 2011

One
disk was found inside a laptop provided for him by the council, where 
he worked for 22 years before being sacked after his 
arrest..

Baqa, who work
colleagues said underwent a transformation in 1996 by growing a long 
beard, wearing traditional Muslim dress and shunning everyone, said he 
was storing the discs for someone else.

London’s
Old Bailey today heard the material contained footage of beheadings and
executions, the explosions of improvised explosive devices, the last 
will and testament of one of the London bombers, footage of the 9/11 
attacks and jihadi fighters in combat.

Sentencing
Baqa, from Barking, east London, Judge Christopher Moss QC said: ‘It is
quite clear to me - and you accept - that you well knew the generality 
of what these discs contained, namely encouragement of, and indeed 
instruction in, violent acts of terrorism.

‘It is from such material that those 
who are already radicalised or about to become so derive their 
knowledge, instruction and involvement in the ways of violent terrorism.

‘That is why it is so dangerous and that is why the courts must deal with it so severely.’

The father-of-six had pleaded guilty to two offences of disseminating terrorist publications earlier this month.

A further seven offences of having material likely to be useful in terrorism were ordered to lie on file.

His activities will be monitored for ten years and his stash is to be destroyed.

The
discs also included five issues of al Qaida’s Inspire magazine, 39 Ways
to Support and Participate in Jihad and 44 Ways to Support Jihad, by 
al-Awlaki, the leader of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and who was 
killed by an American drone in September 2011.

Baqa’s home was raided by police in the early hours of July 5 last year.

Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the recovered discs were entitled Awakening and Pure Intentions.

Baqa’s basis of plea was that he did not intend to distribute the discs but acknowledged that by giving them back to their owner, the messages of hate would be passed on and potentially radicalise Muslims.

The contents also showed how to plan and implement attacks.

It is not known who made and copied the discs, which were also found at Baqa’s work.

Investigations showed that Baqa, who was born in Lahore, Pakistan, had viewed them on a work laptop and used an office computer to make 'frequent' visits to extremist websites.

Police searching his house also discovered a number of extremist books such as Virtues of Jihad, and a sweep of his car located bandanas, flags and material bearing the message: 'There is only one God, Muhammad.'

Mr Dennis said all the materials 'It was in effect a library of material relating to the promotion of extremist Islamic beliefs and violent jihad. It demonstrated a complete intolerance of other religious views.'

Baqa, the son of an English professor, came to the UK when he was two-years-old and holds both British and Pakistani passports.

The al Qaeda magazine Inspire (above) was included in the disks

He has four children with his first wife who died in a car crash in 2007, and two more children with his second wife.

The prosecutor said Baqa’s work colleagues noticed a big change in him around 1996.

'In work appraisals he was noted as somebody who kept himself to himself at all times and who didn’t engage others unless absolutely necessary,' said Mr Dennis.

'His manager said he would sit in a corner creating a physical barrier between him and everyone else.

'His work performance was assessed as average.

'In 1996/7 he grew a beard and started wearing traditional Muslim dress, became reclusive and wouldn’t speak to anybody in the office.

'He developed a deep faith in Islamic religion and promotion of it.'

Andrew Hall QC, defending, said much of the material was available freely on the internet.

He said Baqa, who remarried after his first wife was killed in a car crash in 2007, gave much of his earnings to charity before he lost his job.

‘But for his involvement in religious matters and then being drawn into politics in the way we’ve heard described his life would be praiseworthy indeed.’

His previous convictions date back to the 1980s and include theft, fraud and handling stolen goods.

He also received a short jail term in 1986 for unlawful assembly.
