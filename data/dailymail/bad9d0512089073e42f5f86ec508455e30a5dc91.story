A bus driver's quick reflexes saved the lives of his passengers - and his own - when a lamppost came crashing through his windscreen.

Mao Zhihao, 44, was driving along a busy dual carriageway in eastern China's Zheijang province when a crash on the opposite lane sent the post tumbling into his path.

He narrowly escaped being killed by leaping to one side as the metal pole pierced the windscreen at high speed, but not before bravely taking evasive action to avoid the full force of the impact.

Courage: CCTV footage from aboard the bus shows 
driver Mao Zhihao appearing to let out a shriek as he spots the toppling
lamppost up ahead. He swerves his vehicle to the right to avoid the 
full force of the impact

Crash: Right at the moment the pole comes shattering through the windscreen the driver lunges to the side

Cheating death: The post comes right past where Mr Mao's head would have been had he not reacted so fast

Pinned: Despite bearing the weight of the 
lamppost, Mr Mao puts the bus back in gear and removes his seatbelt to 
start helping his passengers escape from the wrecked vehicle

Battling the pain of a ruptured spleen, the courageous driver then slid from beneath the lamppost which had pinned him to his seat to open the doors so passengers could escape.

The bus's conductor Yu Jingya told China Daily: 'I asked Mao if he was hurt when I got off. He pointed to his stomach. And I saw [there] was blood on his hands.'

CCTV surveillance cameras aboard the number 602 bus from Jiangshan to Quzhou show Mr Mao chatting to someone before apparently letting out a shriek as he spots the danger ahead.

With little time to react, he manages nonetheless to swerve the vehicle to the right before lunging out of the path of the lamppost to escape certain death.

Horror: A second CCTV camera captures passengers' reactions as the pole comes smashing into the bus

Selfless: Despite having just freed himself from the pole, Mr Mao clambers back beneath it to pull the lever opening the doors to allow the shell-shocked passengers to escape

Priorities: After opening the doors he appears 
to check that his phone is still working before leaving the bus himself.
He reported the accident before being taken to hospital, where 
he was treated for a ruptured spleen

The pole slams through the windscreen just in from of Mr Mao, sending shards of glass flying into the bus, and would have surely decapitated him if it wasn't for his quick reaction.

Although the steel column lands heavily on his left, the driver manages to put the bus into gear and bring it to a halt by driving it up against the barriers at the side of the road.

He then frees himself from his seatbelt and clambers back beneath the lamppost to pull a lever opening the doors.

All 26 passengers escape unharmed as Mr Mao reaches for his phone and satchel before getting off the bus himself.

He reported the accident to police before being taken to a Jiangshan hospital for treatment, where doctors found he was suffering from a ruptured spleen.

Lucky escape: The pole went straight through the windscreen on the driver's side of the bus

Heartstopping: The lamp post was reportedly toppled after a separate two-car crash on the opposite lane at around 5pm on Monday afternoon. Mr Mao has been hailed a hero for his actions

'I was pinned down by the lamppost and put the bus into gear instinctively,' said Mr Mao, who has been hailed a hero for his exploits.

'I just wanted to slow the bus down.

'I couldn't see the road, and tried to drive it to one side of the road. The bus hit the guardrails and finally stopped.'

The lamp post was reportedly toppled after a separate two-car crash on the opposite lane at around 5pm on Monday afternoon.
