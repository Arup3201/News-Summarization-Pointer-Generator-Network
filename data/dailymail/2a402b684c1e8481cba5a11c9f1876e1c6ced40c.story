A former security contractor, fired from his role as a medic in Afghanistan after being filmed so stoned he couldn't speak, has spoken out about the shocking culture of alcohol and drug abuse he claims was rife in his military camp.

41-year-old Kevin Carlson was exposed by a pair of whistle-blowing former colleagues who felt so outraged by what they saw taking place they secretly recorded it and passed it on to news outlets.

Employed by Jorge Scientific, a major U.S. defense contractor, Carlson was working as a team medic in Kabul, a role that gave him free range and access to prescription drugs.

He was stationed at the contractor's base of operations, which he described as a 'frat house', turning into a 'nightmare' environment where he felt so trapped he turned to drugs.

Admission: Medical officer Kevin Carlson admitted that he frequently injected himself with narcotics just to 'get away' because the place was such a 'nightmare'

'I don't like airing my own dirty laundry, don't like showing my own faults,' Carlson told Abc News. 'But the story needs to be told… It was getting to be such a nightmare, just living in that place.

Carlson's intoxicated state was among the disturbing scenes captured by whilstleblowers John Melson 
and Kenny Smith, but he insisted that the drugs and alcohol were rife among other employees, including soldiers who would join them for 'dinner and parties'.

'They consumed some of the alcohol,' he said. 'It's not like they didn't have an idea of what we were doing.'

In the interview Carlson told how he used Percocet and Diazepam tablets, at times injecting himself with Ketamine to give his mind 'a mental break'.

'I didn't want to use alcohol because that impaired you for so long and you have the effects the next day,' he said, 'so I chose Ketamine.

'I would take the Ketamine every once in a while just to give my mind a break and escape from the reality that was actually going on.'

Other contractors and staffers would help themselves to Carlson's medical stores, he said, putting the safety of the camp at serious risk.

'There's no way if we ever came under attack that they'd be able to do anything to protect or repel an invasion or an attack.'

Shocking video: The security manager for the company can be seen half-naked and chugging a glass of vodka at the covert location in Afghanistan

Drunk: Melson said there is no way any of the employees involved would have been able to respond to any terror attack because they were so 'out of it'

It was a bitter cycle that Carlson said he felt trapped by, until he was eventually found out and fired.

'The longer I stayed there they kept drinking more. Doing more things that were not normal. Some just childish, dangerous things.'

He added that he hopes he might be able to rekindle his once-promising career.

The shocking video allegedly showing U.S. Security contractors drunk, stoned and engaging in outlandish behavior while they were in Afghanistan protecting American lives was leaked last week.

The footage is believed to have been recorded earlier this year at a Jorge Scientific operations center in Kabul. It appears to show key personnel drunk or high on drugs, chugging drinks, semi-naked wrestling and injecting drugs.

The alleged behavior went undetected by U.S. military officials and put American lives at risk. The whistle blowers revealed that if a terrorist attack had been made at this time, then employees would have been too 'out of it' to respond.

Melson Smith, gave the video to ABC and say it documents a number of allegations they have made in a
lawsuit against Jorge Scientific.

The U.S. Army has now launched a criminal investigation into the Virginia-based company, who has won almost $1 billion in U.S. government contracts.

They said they were unaware of both the video and the allegations until last month.

Whistle blowers Melson and Smith worked as armed 
security officers for three and five months respectively, in Kabul as 
part of a $47 million contract Jorge Scientific had under the U.S. 
Legacy Program to train the Afghan National Police in counter-insurgency
efforts.

They said they quit out of sheer disgust for the behavior, because of the way they were treated by their colleagues, who would bully them for not joining in the party, and out of concern their own safety was being compromised by the behavior.

Melson, a National Guard sergeant who served in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan before working for Jorge Scientific, told ABC: 'It was going against everything that we were trying to do over there. It was like a frat house for adults. 

'Some of them to the point where they were passing out, 
there's firearms laying around, some of them still carrying the firearms
on them.'

High: The medical officer appeared totally out of it after injecting himself with Ketamine, the used syringe is shown lying on the floor beside him

The company says it has taken 
'decisive action to correct the unacceptable behavior of a limited 
number of employees' and that several of them seen on the video are no 
longer employed by Jorge Scientific.

In
a short clip of the video provided to ABC, the security manager for the
company can be seen chugging a glass of vodka and staggering around 
before starting a wrestling match with another employee.

Several bottles of alcohol can be seen sitting on a table in the background.

The
use of alcohol or illegal drugs by U.S. contractors in Afghanistan is 
prohibited by the military, with the manual describing a 
'zero-tolerance' as personnel must be on alert 24/7 for possible 
terrorist attacks.

The 
video then switches to the company's medical officer after he allegedly 
injected himself with Ketamine. The man stares at the camera wide and 
glassy eyed, not being able to respond when asked a question.

When
asked about the video, medical officer Kevin Carlson admitted to ABC 
that he frequently injected himself with narcotics just to 'get away' 
because the place was such a 'nightmare'.

Though
he is no longer employed with them, he revealed there was 'massive drug
and alcohol abuse' at that Jorge Scientific facility, involving 
executives, armed security personnel and himself. 

Whistle blower: John Melson, a National Guard sergeant who served in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan before working for Jorge Scientific, quit after only three months

Accuser: Melson said he quit because of the way he was treated by their colleagues, who would bully them for not joining in the party, out of sheer disgust, and out of concern that their own safety was being compromised by the behavior

The company's senior on-site executive Chris Sullivan was often the ringleader behind the parties and would try to pressure others into taking part, the suit alleges.

He would also allegedly hold blazing bonfires in the outdoor patio despite the fact the location was supposed to be covert.

Employees would often throw live ammunition rounds 
and fire extinguishers into the flames and watch as they exploded, often
sounding like a real bomb explosion, the whistle blowers claim.

Melson said: 'There was nothing covert with bringing all that added attention. Afghanistan is not the time or the place 
to be carrying on like that.'

Sullivan does not work with Jorge Scientific any more and refused to comment on the allegations.

In a statement to ABC News, Colonel Tom Collins, a U.S. Army spokesperson for the International Security Assistance Force, said: 'Clearly, behavior such as that described by ABC News is not indicative of the outstanding work that thousands of contractors and service members perform every day in Afghanistan.

'We are confident that our personnel conduct themselves in ways that makes our nation proud and we should not allow the actions of a few, if determined to be true, to detract from that fact.'

Jorge is now conducting their own investigation but said they made management changes to the operation in Afghanistan before the lawsuit was filed.

Their statement said: 'These individuals are seeking monetary damages by mis-characterizing 
these actions as "fraud".

'The company remains confident that the personal misconduct did not 
impact the company's contract performance.'

If the allegations turn out to be true, it may stoke U.S.-Afghan relations even further and could add to rage over perceived U.S. disrespect for local values.

'This arrogant image that Americans have worldwide, this was feeding right into it,' said Melson.

The full video will be broadcast in a report this evening on ABC World News with Diane Sawyer and Nightline.
