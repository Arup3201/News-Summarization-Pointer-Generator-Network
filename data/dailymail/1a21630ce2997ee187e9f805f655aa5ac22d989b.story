Shaun the Sheep is the biggest star on children’s television – baa none. And now he and his friends are heading for Hollywood.

Our exclusive photograph from Shaun’s first feature film shows him and pals in a pose instantly familiar from the days of Beatlemania.

In the film, out next year, Shaun and his flock grow bored with life on Mossy Bottom Farm and head for the bright lights of the city.

Shaun and his Mossy Bottom crew in their 'disguises', hope to go unnoticed as they recreate The Beatles' famous zebra crossing scene 

The real Fab Four on the zebra crossing outside Abbey Road studios. The image became the cover for their Abbey Road album 

But they soon find being a sheep around town isn’t all it’s cracked up to be and long for the safety of home.

They try to disguise the fact they are sheep but find it difficult to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes. And they find danger round every corner, including a cat with more than a resemblance to Hannibal Lecter from The Silence Of The Lambs.

Shaun debuted in the Wallace & Gromit adventure A Close Shave, in 1995, but could now eclipse his former co-stars in the fame stakes.

The farmyard friends also discover that city life has big risks, in the form of fast-food shops 

He is the star of his own television show, which has been shown in 180 countries, and was recently voted the best children’s character in the history of BBC Television, ahead of both Postman Pat and Bob The Builder.

Shaun The Sheep is released in UK cinemas on February 6, 2015.
