Progress: The research marks a step towards producing more effective treatment for migraine sufferers. Around 40 per cent of patients do not respond to available medication

Hopes of a migraine cure have been boosted by the discovery of genes linked to the crippling headaches.

In the largest study ever to look at 
migraines, researchers have identified five more sections of our DNA 
associated with their onset.

They have also confirmed the importance of seven more of these ‘genetic regions’ which have previously been linked to migraines.

Most of them contain genes responsible
for controlling brain circuitry or maintaining healthy brain tissue, 
while some are also linked to healthy circulation and cardiovascular 
disease.

Scientists say the research, which 
looked at more than 100,000 genetic samples, offers a fresh 
understanding of what triggers migraines.

The team uncovered the genetic regions
linked to the illness by comparing the results from 29 health studies, 
which involved DNA samples from both migraine patients and healthy 
individuals.

Some of the regions identified were found to be close to a 
network of genes that are sensitive to an imbalance of oxygen.

The researchers suggest these 
susceptible genetic regions are interconnected and could be disrupting 
the internal regulation of the brain, resulting in migraine symptoms. By
the end of next year, the team hopes to map more than half of the genes
linked to the condition.

Medication is available to alleviate 
the intense headaches, which can be accompanied by nausea and an acute 
sensitivity to light.

But around 40 per cent of patients do not respond, while 15 per cent develop chronic migraines.

It is hoped the research could lead to
new treatments becoming available in the next few years. Lead author Dr
Aarno Palotie, whose study is published in the journal Nature Genetics,
said: ‘This study has greatly advanced our biological insight about the
cause of migraine.

‘Migraine and epilepsy are 
particularly difficult neural conditions to study; between episodes the 
patient is basically healthy so it’s extremely difficult to uncover 
biochemical clues.’

Dr Palotie, from the Wellcome Trust 
Sanger Institute, which is based in Cambridge, said: ‘We are narrowing 
down the areas that cause migraines.

‘In the future, we will be able to 
look at an individual’s DNA profile and target them with a more 
personalised, tailored treatment, rather than a fix all.’

Thought to affect one in every seven 
adults, migraines have been recognised by the World Health Organisation 
as one of the top 20 most disabling lifetime conditions and cost the 
British economy an estimated £2billion a year.
