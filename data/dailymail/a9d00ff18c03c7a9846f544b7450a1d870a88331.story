The newlywed husband who secretly stole £18,000 from his bride's family remarried while on bail for his crimes.

Yesterday the Daily Mail told how Charlie Astrand, 25, found out her new husband Huw Jones, 31, had been stealing from the family business when her father told her at the airport as the pair arrived back from their honeymoon.

And today it has been revealed that two weeks ago Jones remarried, just days before he appeared in Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court where he admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft.

Second time lucky:  Huw Jones, 31, left, with his first wife Charlie Astrand, 25, whose family business he stole from.  And right with his new wife Neely Jones who he wed just days before he appeared in court

Nuptials: Jones's second bride was also married in white and with a tiara when she walked down the aisle at Easter

Miss Astrand has told how she was left 'in pieces' at her new husband's betrayal - but Jones moved on in his life 'without a care'.

Jones was still married to Miss Astrand when he met mother-of-two Neely Davies, 27, and got her pregnant months later.

Jones's second bride was also married in white and with a tiara when she walked down the aisle at Easter.

Embarrassed Jones yesterday refused to talk about how he stole from Miss Astrand's father's car dealership in Aberdare, South Wales.

His policeman father Carl, 50, said he did not wish to talk about his new life without Miss Astrand  - and with his second wife.

Moved on: Jones was still married to Miss Astrand when he met mother-of-two Neely Davies, 27 left, and got her pregnant months later

Perfect wedding: Charlie Astrand, 25, with her new husband Huw Jones, 
31, on their wedding day. Charlie's father Graham is pictured left, and 
her mother Alison is right. But when she returned from honeymoon, the primary school teacher's dream turned into a nightmare

But a family friend said: 'Huw has moved on in his life - he regrets what happened but he's not one to wallow in it.

'He feels it was all a big mistake and that he was under a lot of pressure. He needed a fresh start.

'He met Neely after everything went wrong with him and Charlie - he felt it was right to move on.

'I'm not sure if the baby was planned but he's enjoying becoming a dad and Neely's two kids think the world of him.'

Yesterday Miss Astrand, said her 'world came crashing in' when she learned that the man she had married was a fraud.

Anguish: Charlie, 25, with her father Graham who broke the news to her that her new husband had been stealing from the family home as he drove her back from the airport

She and Jones had been away for only two days when Mr Astrand discovered his new son-in-law had fiddled the books.

He went to the police but was advised to let the couple finish their honeymoon before confronting his employee.

After paying for the white wedding and
contributing towards the two-week honeymoon on the island of Aruba, Mr 
Astrand waited at the airport arrivals lounge armed with proof of 
Jones's crimes. Miss Astrand, whose marriage collapsed at that point, 
said: 'It was the worst moment of my life – I had just had the most 
blissful honeymoon with the man I loved.

Miss Astrand was shown the paperwork 
which proved her new husband had helped himself to the cash from the 
family firm in Aberdare, South Wales.

The post-honeymoon drama was revealed 
at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court when Jones, the son of a policeman, 
admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft but was spared jail.

Mr Astrand and his wife Alison were in court to hear how £18,478 'fell through the gaps' of the company accounting system.

Picture perfect: Charlie's parents paid £20,000 for her wedding and contributed towards their two-week luxury honeymoon on the Caribbean island of Aruba

Wedding joy: Charlie, right, had no idea that Huw Jones was defrauding her father's company during her four-year relationship - until the news was broken to her after her honeymoon

Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Jones 
had forged signatures, manipulated the accounts and sweetened deals. He 
forged documents and upped the amount of money in loan applications, 
unbeknown to customers.

'He did it to impress his fiancée and her family – and to up his sales figures for commission.'

The court heard Jones cunningly hid 
his dodgy dealings during his two-year engagement to his boss's 
daughter, leading up to their marriage in July 2010.

Mr Edwards said: 'Mr Astrand was waiting at the airport to confront his new son-in-law when he stepped off the plane.'

Laurence Jones, defending, said: 
'Jones had taken on responsibilities he could not cope with in an 
overwhelming desire to impress his future father-in-law.'

Happy couple: Charlie with her new boyfriend Chris Heneman who is an accountant

He added that Jones had 'learned a 
very long, hard salutary lesson and is remorseful for his actions'. 
Judge Dan Williams gave Jones a nine-month suspended jail sentence, 
telling him: 'I have given you a chance even though I am not convinced 
you deserve it. Please don't blow it.'

Jones was also ordered to carry out 250 hours unpaid work and complete a 'thinking skills programme'.

His ex-wife, who has started a new 
relationship with accountant Chris Henneman, said of her former husband:
'He has lived a happy life for the past two-and-a-half years – he's met
someone new, got married and even has a child. He still hasn't paid a 
price for everything he did. Every day we have to deal with it.

'We really thought he would go to 
prison and that would be the end of it. But I feel like he's had no 
punishment for the pain and hurt he's caused me and my family.'

She added: 'I have a very happy life with Chris, and it's because of him I am where I am today – he's been my rock.'

Mr Astrand said of the sentence: 'I 
wanted justice for Charlie and for our customers but he was let off with
a suspended sentence. That is a disgrace. He deserved to spend time 
behind bars for what he had done.'
