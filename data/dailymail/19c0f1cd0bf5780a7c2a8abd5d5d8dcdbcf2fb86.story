Barcelona are expected to announce that club legend Xavi Hernandez will finally be leaving them after 23 years service.

The club captain has negotiated a settlement on the two years left on his contract leaving the way clear for him to join Manchester City’s MLS franchise New York City.

The club captain who turned up at the Camp Nou as a hopeful 11-year-old and went on to play a record 723 matches for them, winning 22 trophies leaves the club after 16 seasons with the first team.

Heading to America: Barcelona midfielder Xavi could join Frank Lampard at New York City FC

Barca fans have feared the confirmation of Xavi’s departure for weeks and with this Thursday set as the date for his return to training finally confirmation is imminent.

Although Manchester City’s new MLS side New York City looks like being his new destination that will still give him a year to fill ahead of their big kick-off in 2015.

The confirmation of his departure, expected from the club on Tuesday, means that when Barcelona jet into England on Monday to spend a week at the FA’s St. George’s Park they will do so without one of the most important players in their history – the player who led them to three of their four European Cup triumphs.

Xavi is expected to take part in a benefit game for Deco who retired last year on Friday. He will line up along side Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Leo Messi in a match between the Porto side that won the Champions Leage under Jose Mourinho in 2004 and the Barcelona side that won it in 2006 in Portugal on Friday.
