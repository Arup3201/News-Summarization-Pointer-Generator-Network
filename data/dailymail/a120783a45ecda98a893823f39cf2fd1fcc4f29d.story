Louis van Gaal shouldn't have to defend his Manchester United side's perceived lack of entertainment value, says club legend Peter Schmeichel, as long as the boss gets results.

United's style under the Dutch manager has been described as 'long-ball', especially after their 1-1 draw with Sam Allardyce's West Ham. Paul Scholes called it 'miserable' while former boss Tommy Docherty feared Van Gaal was alienating fans.

But Schmeichel believes the criticism is unfair even if the style is at odds with what would have been expected given Van Gaal's reputation from his time at the likes of Ajax and Bayern Munich.  

Manchester United has been labelled boring under Louis van Gaal, which is fine by Peter Schmeichel

'I don't mind a different style of play, or a boring style, for a limited period, because what I want most of all is the club back to winning ways and believing they can win,' Schmeichel told The Sun.

'It's important for the players to start understanding how much better it is to feel like you can win.'

Schmeichel, who won the Champions League, five Premier Leagues and three FA Cups in goal for the Red Devils, says the side has 'progressed' from where they were last year and despite a loss last time out against Swansea they are now genuine contenders for the top four.

After finishing seventh last campaign under David Moyes, Van Gaal's United are fourth in the Premier League with Arsenal a point ahead in third and Southampton one point behind.

And while catching Chelsea (13 points ahead) and Manchester City (eight points) is probably too much to ask, a return to Europe's top club competition next season as part of the Premier League's top four is realistic.

United host Sunderland on Saturday on the back of a disappointing loss to Swansea. They face a Black Cats side struggling after draws with Swansea and West Brom either side of losses to QPR in the league and League One Bradford in the FA Cup.
