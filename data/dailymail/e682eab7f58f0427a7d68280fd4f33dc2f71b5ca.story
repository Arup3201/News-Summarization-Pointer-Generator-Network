The Pulaski School District bus had 26 people aboard, including the 74-year-old driver, 22 students and three coaches

Pastor Vorpagel said the couple had told each other why they loved each other just hours before the accident, reports Green Bay Press Gazette.

'It's a blessing last night for them to be able to tell each other why they loved each other,' Vorpagel said.

Before her death Hall had been planned to run the Udder Mudder race in Marshfield. So in tribute to her, her bridesmaids completed the course this weekend, wearing the purple gowns

Her sister Angie Guralsk said: 'She was such an amazing, amazing girl and a lot of fun'

The group took part in every aspect of the course to remember the 24-year-old

'I asked them why they love each other, and it was kind of both humorous and beautiful. 

'He said, 'you keep me grounded, make me feel special, I can trust you.''

'He listed things like that. When she listed her things, she said, "I know you come from a good family, you love your family; that's a big thing for me ..." Those kinds of things.'

'Since we won't be wearing them on the fourth we thought this would be the perfect way to honor her.' 

Dozens of family members and friends joined them and cheered them on.

The Pulaski School District bus had 26 people aboard, including the 74-year-old driver, 22 students and three coaches. 

Thirteen students were injured and six were taken to the hospital. 

All were released after treatment, school superintendent Milt Thompson.

Brown County Sheriff's Capt. Randy Schultz said his staff was investigating the September 2 crash but only to help Shawano County, which will release the findings. 

By all appearances, the bus driver failed to yield to the westbound car, Schultz said.
