Theo Walcott was seemingly involved in an altercation with Arsenal supporters following his side's humiliating Champions League defeat by  Monaco at the Emirates on Wednesday night.

After the final whistle the England international shared a tight embrace with Monaco defender Aymen Abdennour before swapping shirts with the Tunisia international.

It was a move that irked the supporters that had bothered to stay until the end of the match, who appeared to vent their frustrations in the direction of Walcott.

The forward apparently responded by gesturing towards the Arsenal fans motioning with his hand to suggest the criticism did not affect him.

After such a shambolic display Walcott's reaction is likely to be received with further anger from the home faithful who booed their team off the pitch.

The Gunners were beaten 3-1 by the Ligue 1 side and now face a mammoth task to reach the last eight of the competition when they play the second leg in three weeks' time.
