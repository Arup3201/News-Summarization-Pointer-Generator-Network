From sweltering in the summer to being crushed into a sweaty man’s armpit at rush hour, many of the world’s antiquated underground rail networks are in need of an overhaul.

Now futuristic images of what London’s tube trains might look like have been revealed – and they include features that are set to make journeys more comfortable and reliable for passengers.

The 250 sleek new trains will be driverless - similar to the current Docklands Light Railway trains - and will grace the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo and City lines as soon as 2025.

Futuristic images of what London’s tube trains might look like have been revealed – and they include features that are set to make journeys more comfortable and reliable for passengers

They will be high capacity, cooler – thanks to air conditioning – and have walk-through carriages.

This will make them similar to the new batch of carriages recently introduced on the Circle, District and Hammersmith and City lines.  

But most importantly, they will be driverless and run with new signalling systems to cut delays.

The trains will be driverless and run with new signalling systems to cut delays. At first, drivers will take control of the new trains but the plan is to make them fully autonomous

Carriages will feature air-cooling for the first time on deep sections of the Tube.

They will be more accessible - with step-free access from the platform, walk-through carriages and wider doors.

The trains are designed to be driverless, but when they first enter service they will have an operator on board.

Along with modernised signal systems, they will enable faster, more frequent and reliable services with fewer delays.

Their design is futuristic with echoes of the Underground's heritage.

The next generation Underground trains will come in to service from the mid-2020s.

They will run on the Piccadilly line, followed by the Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo & City lines.

The trains are designed to last for at least 40 years.

They will boost capacity by 25% on the Central and Bakerloo lines, 50% on the Waterloo & City line and 60% on the Piccadilly line.

At first, drivers will take control of the new trains, which have been designed by London's Priestman Goode, but the plan is to make them fully autonomous.

Transport for London (TFL) said: ‘We would only consider implementing full automation following extensive engagement with our customers, stakeholders, staff and trade unions.’

Capacity will grow by 25 per cent on the Central and Bakerloo lines, 50 per cent on the Waterloo Line and up to 60 per cent on the Piccadilly line.

This is to cope with London’s growing population, which is expected to increase to 10 million in 2030

`These innovative, eye-catching and sleek new trains will be vital for the continued modernisation of London Underground,’ said the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

‘They will ferry millions of people across our city, more comfortably, reliably and stylishly than ever before. 

'The New Tube marks a significant step forward in giving Londoners and visitors the accessible and modern transport service that they expect and deserve.

‘These beautiful, air-cooled machines represent the best of British design and innovation. 

'They will help to keep London and its economy moving in the right direction.'
