The Republican Presidential contenders are tonight nervously awaiting the results of the Iowa caucus - as early entrance polls predict Ron Paul will win closely followed by Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in third.

Many likely caucus-goers are still undecided ahead of Tuesday night’s voting but poll leader Mr Romney declared he wants ‘the kind of send-off we need for a pretty long campaign season’.

Only 25 delegates are at stake in Iowa out of 1,144 needed to win the Republican nomination, but the Iowa voting is seen as a key indication as to how the rest of the race will pan out this year.

‘This has been a failed presidency,’ former Massachusetts governor Mr Romney said in Des Moines, Iowa, in a blistering attack on Barack Obama. ‘I will go to work to get Americans back to work.’

The volatile race has elevated and discarded a wide assortment of front-runners, with some falling out of the race or not even deciding to run - such as businessmen Herman Cain and Donald Trump.

The two who seem most likely to challenge Mr Romney for victory in Iowa were former Pennsylvania senator Mr Santorum and libertarian Texas Representative Ron Paul.

Texas Governor Rick Perry and Mr Gingrich seem likelier to give Mr Romney a long-haul challenge, but Mr Santorum insisted his rise is because Iowans are ‘looking for the candidate they can trust’.

Republicans will gather in living rooms, high school gymnasiums and local libraries for caucuses that start the process of picking the GOP nominee on Tuesday night.

Voters will urge friends and neighbours to support a preferred candidate. But for all of the attention paid to the caucuses, they are essentially a nonbinding straw poll that awards no delegates.

Mitt Romney

Republicans do that at county and district conventions later in the year. President Obama isn't ceding the stage to the Republicans while they kick off sorting out the 1,144 delegates.

The President, fresh off a 10-day Hawaiian vacation with his family rumoured to have cost $4million, made plans to host an evening web chat with supporters in Iowa as the caucuses were under way.

Most polls in recent days have put Mr Romney and Mr Paul atop the GOP field in Iowa, with Mr Santorum in third and gaining ground. More than a third of voters could yet change their minds.

But Mr Perry, Mr Gingrich and Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann are trailing and not looking likely to do well in Iowa. Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman is all but out of the state race.

Mr Romney - whose rivals are trying to exploit questions about his moderate past - faces the same challenge he did in 2008 of winning over a conservative base uncomfortable with much of this.

'I want to make sure I vote for and caucus for someone who is a winner. We cannot have another four years of Obama'

Paul Massey

Four years ago socially conservative voters united behind former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, denying Mr Romney a first-place finish and contributing to his eventual defeat.

Mr Perry told Fox News that Mr Romney is simply a ‘conservative of convenience.’ Mrs Bachmann, another of the onetime front-runners who has fallen, said she is the ‘one true conservative’.

Mr Gingrich, who still insists anyone could win, said Mr Romney should ‘level with the American people’ about his moderate political views and admitted on CBS that he is calling his rival a ‘liar’.

Early on, Mr Gingrich had insisted he would run a positive campaign, but that strategy disappeared after he sank in the polls under the weight of negative ads paid for by his opponents.

Mr Santorum, blaming the Paul campaign for recorded phone calls questioning his policies on guns and abortion, told Fox News that his rival is ‘disgusting’.

'It might come down to the speeches at the caucuses. I want to support someone who can go all the way and defeat the Democrats in November'

Phil Ubben

The former senator’s conservative views on issue like gay marriage and abortion make him popular with evangelical Christian voters - a strong force in Iowa Republican politics.

Mr Romney said he can handle any criticism his Republican rivals heap on him, calling it only a warm-up to whatever will come from Obama's camp. ‘My shoulders are wide,’ he told Fox News.

He is trying to win Iowa by arguing he is the most electable candidate against President Obama - a pitch that is winning over conservatives who desperately want to beat the Democrat.

‘I want to make sure I vote for and caucus for someone who is a winner. We cannot have another four years of Obama,’ said eyeglass salesman Paul Massey, 65.

The voter turnout will help drive results. In 2008, a record of more than 120,000 Republicans showed up. Weather could be a factor in this year's attendance, with clear conditions forecast.

GOP voters in Iowa gather for the caucuses at more than 800 sites across the state beginning at 7pm local time (8pm ET). Results should begin to come in within a few hours after then.

After Tuesday's vote, Mr Romney, Mr Gingrich and Mr Santorum planned to depart immediately for New Hampshire, where the primary is on January 10. Mr Paul will join them there later this week.

Mr Romney holds a commanding lead in polls there, and will be in a strong position to win even if he doesn't win in Iowa. Mr Perry and Mrs Bachmann don't plan to compete in New Hampshire.

They are instead heading straight from Iowa to the first South primary, set for January 21 in South Carolina. Mr Romney also plans to visit that state this week. Florida is on January 31.

‘It might come down to the speeches at the caucuses,’ said voter Phil Ubben, of Sioux City, Iowa. ‘I want to support someone who can go all the way and defeat the Democrats in November.’
