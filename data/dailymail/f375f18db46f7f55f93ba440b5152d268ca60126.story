Downpours are expected to drench parts of Britain again today as autumn appears to have arrived early bringing gale force winds and temperatures as low as 2C.

Summer is almost certainly over as chilly winds blowing in from Scandinavia could send the mercury to as low as 2C in parts of Scotland while the Lake District and Cumbria could experience lows of 8C.

Coasts in the north of England could also be battered by 50mph gale force winds while the rest of the country faces increasingly blustery conditions.

Heavy rain 
and thunderstorms, particularly over London, caused damage and 
disruption last night as up to a third of a month’s rain fell inside a 
few hours.

But
 the weather front had shifted towards the continent early this morning 
and two flood warnings and nine flood alerts, mainly in the North East, 
remained of the 34 issued yesterday morning.

Paul
 Knightley, a spokesman for forecaster MeteoGroup, said: 'The front that
 brought those heavy downpours is moving to the continent and for today 
there will be some thundery showers, mainly from the Yorkshire area to 
East Anglia but not as heavy as yesterday.'

The
 Environment Agency warned immediate action be taken in Sunderland and 
Whitley Bay, as high North Sea spring tides meant high water levels and 
flooding was expected this morning.

And
 while the rain may have eased off, warmer weather is still some way 
from making a return, as Mr Knightley warned: 'Saturday looks like a 
fine day but Sunday will be windy, with gusts of up to 50mph in some 
places.'

As
 a result of yesterday’s rainfall, which London Fire Brigade (LFB) 
called 'biblical' on Twitter, the service said it had been called out to
 around 20 separate flooding-related incidents in a little over an hour.

Most of the incidents were understood to have involved water getting into the basements of properties.

LFB
 said one person was rescued from a flooded basement flat in Forest 
Hill, south London, after water 'entered via street drains due to heavy 
rain'.

It comes after the tail-end of Hurricane Bertha caused the wettest 24-hour period of the year last weekend.

Environment
 minister George Eustice said: 'Heavy rain can often bring a risk of 
localised flooding. Information is available from the Environment Agency
 and emergency services and I urge people to listen to the advice and 
warnings issued.'

Music
 fans at V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex, would be wise not to forget 
their waterproofs and wellington boots, as scattered showers are 
expected to hit the site over the weekend. 

Around
 35,000 cars will be travelling to the site for the start of the event 
today, with chaos predicted on the surrounding roads.

Attire: Three revellers arrive at the festival wearing shorts, but have their wellington boots on ready for the showers that are expected throughout the weekend

Warning: The Met Office has said the festival, which is being held at the site in Essex as well as Weston Park in Staffordshire, will be hit by rain and points over the next three days

Home for the weekend: Two festival-goers carry bedding and a folding chair as they find a spot to set up camp for the event

Outlook: The forecast shows that showers are expected to continue, with rain covering most of the country on Sunday 

Alert: A yellow weather warning has been issued for a large part of central and eastern England with heavy rain forecast in the next 24 hours 

The UK has already seen nearly its entire rainfall for August in the first half of the month.

Figures released by the Met Office show that up to the 13th of August, there has been 86.1mm of rain, just short of the 89.5mm long-term (1981-2010) average.

Looking at individual countries, Scotland has already seen more than its full-month average with 121.4mm of rain so far compared to the average of 116.7mm. The Inverness and Moray areas have been particularly wet, with significant flooding from ex-hurricane Bertha on 10 to 11 August.

Rainfall for England and Northern Ireland so far is just under the full-month average, while Wales has been the driest relatively speaking – with 83.2mm of rain making up 77 per cent of its full-month average. Normally at this stage you would expect about 42 per cent of the average to have fallen.

With regards to temperatures and sunshine, the month has been much closer to average so far.

The UK mean temperature is currently 15.2C, which is 0.3C above the full-month average.

UK sunshine hours are at 77.8 hours, which is 48 per cent of the full-month average – so just ahead of where we’d expect after 13 days of the month.

While these figures are interesting, they don’t tell us where the month will end up overall – we’ll have to wait until the full-month figures are in before deciding where this August fits in to the records.

As we head in to next week there should be a good deal of drier weather but with northerly winds bringing in cooler air it will feel colder than of late, especially at night.

This will feel noticeably cool in the wind, so people heading out in the evening may want to take a few extra layers.
