The BBC has defended the latest episode of Doctor Who after viewers complained it was too disturbing.

Saturday night’s edition of the show - the first of a two-part climax to the series - saw the Doctor and sidekick Clara Oswald caught up a plot dealing with the afterlife, which then led into an invasion of Earth by the Cybermen.

It said the storyline, which saw Clara’s boyfriend Danny apparently killed in a car crash, was ‘appropriate’.

Too scary? Some say the adventures of the Doctor and sidekick Clara (right) aren't appropriate for children  

The children’s drama, which was watched by 5.3 million viewers, saw dead bodies transformed into an army of Cybermen.

At one point it is suggested the bodies of the dead could feel the pain of being cremated, and the Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi, is told: ‘All the graves on Earth are about to give birth.’

The BBC received 118 complaints about the fact the children’s drama dealt with the afterlife.

Another nine complained to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, which said it is assessing whether to launch an investigation.

Some people expressed disappointment on Twitter that the BBC did not warn viewers of the program's morbid content.

'Sad. Doctor Who should have had a warning, recently bereaved - terminally ill,' said @joh2710.

They continued: 'The idea that dead people feel cremation is appalling especially for terminally ill people.'  

The episode goes to air at 8:00pm - an hour before the 9:00pm watershed after which adult content is allowed to be broadcast. 

'Scary': Some on social media said dealing with cremation and the afterlife was too much

However, the BBC defended the episode’s dark themes and actor Peter Capaldi has stated previously that he wanted Doctor Who to take on a darker edge.

'I was keen he be a little darker,' the actor told the BBC in August.

'He's struggling with himself and who he is.' 

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Doctor Who is a family drama with a long tradition of tackling some of the more fundamental questions about life and death.

‘We were mindful of the themes explored in Dark Water and are confident that they are appropriate in the context of the heightened sci-fi world of the show.

‘The scene in which a character reveals [an] unconventional theory about the afterlife was preceded by the same character warning the Doctor and Clara several times that what they were about to hear could be distressing.

‘When the Doctor does hear these claims, he immediately pours scorn on them, dismissing them out of hand as a “con” and a “racket”. It transpires that he is correct, and the entire concept is revealed to be a scam perpetrated by Missy.’

The current series reaches its conclusion on Saturday.
