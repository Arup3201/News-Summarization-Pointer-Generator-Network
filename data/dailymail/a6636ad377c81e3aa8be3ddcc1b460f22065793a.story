San Francisco 49ers cornerback Tarell Brown has lost out on $2million

It was perhaps the most costliest skipping of the gym in history.

NFL cornerback Tarell Brown has forfeited $2million of his base salary after he failed to attend his team's voluntary off-season workouts.

By not reading the small print, the San Fransisco 49ers player lost the cash because he did not turn up to exercise with the rest of the team - and he has now fired his agent over the costly blunder.

Brown, 28, said he normally trains alone in his home state of Texas; but did not realize that by working out there instead of in California, his salary would plunge to $925,000.

The detail in the contract stated that the off-season workouts would have triggered an escalator in his deal, Larry Brown Sports reported.

But the athlete said he was unaware of the clause, and only discovered his error when he read a Yahoo article about it on Twitter yesterday.

The cornerback, who played college football for the University of Texas, immediately fired his agent, Brian Overstreet, ESPN reported.

Brown explained his decision to fire his agent, saying that it was Overstreet's responsibility to inform the player about details in his contract, the San Fransisco Gate reported.

'That's what agents get paid to do – to orchestrate the contract and let you know what you can and can’t do as far as workouts, OTAs, things of that sort,' Brown said.

'That’s what he got paid to do. He didn’t do that. So, in my opinion, you have to be let go.

'We all are held accountable for our actions and it’s just part of the business.'

Should have come to California: Because the athlete was working out in Texas, he missed out on a clause which would have triggered a pay increase

Brown (right) said he didn't know about that clause in the deal and only learned of it via Twitter

Overstreet was unavailable to comment when the Mail Online tried to contact him.

Brown said he had no problem with working out, but had routinely returned home to prepare himself for the next season, ESPN reported.

'It's something I've always done as far as off-season at home and training and getting myself in shape.

'It had nothing to do with not being in shape, not wanting to work out, no contract problems, it just had to do with me wanting to go back home and train.

'It's something I've been doing for the past few years.'

He had been set to earn $2.925 million this season in base salary after signing a three-year, $7.125 million extension in 2009.

The 49ers selected Brown in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft.

He is involved in two foundations to help others.

One is the 'Brown's Kids Foundation', which aims to improve the quality of life for disadvantaged youth while creating an environment of care and support in areas of education, reduction of poverty and disparity.

The other the 'Born Again Foundation', which strives the to restore the lives of ex-offenders returning to society, and provide preventative methods to reduce recidivism of ex-offenders, by offering them alternative solutions and a chance at independence and self-sufficiency by 'making a positive transition to a new life.'
