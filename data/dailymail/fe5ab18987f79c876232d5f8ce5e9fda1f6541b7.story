in his company to prepare for a divorce that could cost him up to $1.5billion,
the second most expensive in history.

is that kind of relationship. In our case, we are both busy.

think it’s nonsense and, between us, if we know what is going on in our lives
and we are happy, that kind of stuff is part of his being in the public eye’.

of their marriage

that way.’
