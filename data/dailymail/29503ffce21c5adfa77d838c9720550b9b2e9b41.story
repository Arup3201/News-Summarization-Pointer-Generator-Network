An earthquake hit Loughborough in Leicestershire giving residents an early morning shock.

The tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and was recorded by the Edinburgh-based British Geological Society at 5.20am.

The quake occurred yesterday at a depth of 13km and was said to have been felt by residents over a wide area including Nottingham, Leicester, Derby and Matlock.

Where the earthquake struck: Residents in Loughborough in Leicestershire got a shock

Movement: The tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and was recorded by the Edinburgh-based British Geological Society at 5.20am yesterday

One resident in Groby, Leicestershire, told BBC Radio Leicester: ‘It lasted at least 20 seconds and some DVDs fell off a shelf in my room.’

Another caller, from Leicester, said: ‘It sounded like an underground train coming and everything wobbled, but nothing fell off shelves.’

It was a million times weaker than the 8.9 earthquake which struck off the Japanese coast, causing a devastating tsunami in March 2011.

On Monday the old mining area of New Ollerton in Nottinghamshire was also hit by a smaller quake - its second in as many days.

The quake measured 1.8 magnitude and struck at 10.09 am at a depth of 2km.

Britain is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes every year, but most are too small to detect.

Once a century there is a quake with a magnitude of 5.5 which is capable of badly damaging buildings.

Britain’s largest quake was in 1931 in Hull -  it had a ­magnitude 6.1 and killed one person.

Another damaging UK earthquake was in the Colchester area in 1884.

Some 1200 buildings needed repairs, chimneys collapsed and walls were cracked.

The tremor was said to have been felt by several residents in New Ollerton.

Another earthquake hit the area at 3.59am on Saturday - also at a depth of 2 km.

Despite its early morning timing, residents also felt that one too.

They are the latest of a recent series of tremors to be measured by the British Geological Survey in the UK.

There are roughly 200-300 quakes in Britain every year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them.

However between 20-30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area.

UK earthquakes, particularly in Scotland, are most often attributed to glacial rebound. Until about 10, 500 years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle.

These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process.

The UK is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, which is slowly pushing the entire of Eurasia to the east, and from the northward motion of Africa, which is pushing into Europe from the south.

In addition there are smaller spreading centres beneath the North Sea, the Rhine Valley and the Bay of Biscay, all of which exert tectonic stresses upon Britain.
