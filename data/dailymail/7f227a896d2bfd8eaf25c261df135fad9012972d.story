Patient groups have criticised the decision to place the first privately run hospital into special measures – saying it was clear care was improving.

Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS trust, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was last week rated ‘inadequate’ by the Care Quality Commission, which gave it the lowest-ever score for care.

Hours before the report was published, Circle, the private firm which has run the hospital since February 2012, announced it was pulling out.

Special measures: The privately run Hitchingbrooke hospital, Huntingdon, which has been placed into special measures after the Care Quality Commission found serious failings in A&E, among other problems

But local patients said they had seen no problems with care at the organisation.

The trust had been hailed as a ‘miracle cure’ for the NHS and received glowing patient surveys and a recent award for ‘best NHS trust for patient care’, from data monitors CHKS.

The CQC found serious failings in A&E and warned that food, drink and call bells were left out of patients’ reach, and some were denied pain relief.

Circle’s decision and the report are major blows to the Government which is aiming to increase private sector involvement in the NHS to improve services.

Some fear there has been a stitch-up by opponents of private enterprise in the NHS.

Last night Diane Edwards, of Friends of Hinchingbrooke Hospital, said: ‘It came as a complete surprise because we have seen a lot of improvements at the hospital.’

Alison Watson, of Small Steps which supports children with Down’s Syndrome, said: ‘I’d have liked them to continue … everything was going swimmingly. It just seemed like they were thinking more about us as people rather than numbers going through a system.’

Gordon Dyer, of local charity Acorn Cancer Support Group, said: ‘I don’t know where the issue of standards of care falling has come from because I haven’t noticed it.’ 

He added: ‘The deal was controversial … [but] as far as I could tell it was being managed well.’

Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘The NHS needs every possible way the service can function to be thoroughly explored because at the moment it is a bottomless pit for taxpayers’ money.’

Patients also expressed concern. Mother-of-three Elli Slyfield, 28, from March, said: ‘I would be gutted if it closes.

‘The communication with the staff was really good, the equipment was brilliant and the facilities were great too.’

Failing: The CQC gave Hitchingbrooke the lowest-ever score for care in a report last week. Circle, the private firm which has run the hospital since February 2012, pulled out hours before the report was published

But Brian Sandover, 80, whose wife died of renal failure in the hospital three days after being admitted last February, criticised the management. 

An inquest found nurses had left Ann Sandover, 77, without fluids for up to eight hours.

Circle is challenging the CQC’s findings and believes it has been judged unfairly. 

The Mail understands at least one of the 35 inspectors is a member of campaign group Keep Our NHS Public.
