A young mother who spent up to £450 a month eating in McDonald's has lost more than five stone after kicking her junk food habit.

Bakery worker Lauren Wallis, who lives in Lowestoft, Suffolk, had tipped the scales at 14 stone 4lb after going to the burger chain up to three times a day.

The 25-year-old would gorge on seven hot dogs in one sitting and would eat giant portions of Coco Pops out of a mixing bowl.

Lauren Wallis enjoyed eating hot dogs and fatty foods but after cutting out the junk, she slimmed down from more than 14 stone (left) to a trim nine stone (right)

But when Lauren reached a size 18, she was horrified after she saw a photograph of herself looking bloated on a night out.

After the birth of her daughter Mia, now two, Lauren decided to join a slimming club and lost more than five stone in four months, slimming down to a trim size 8. 

She swapped junk food for healthy home cooked meals then decided to use Instagram to inspire others.

Now Lauren is posting healthy recipes, diet tips and 'before and after' photos in a bid to help her 19,000 followers shed the pounds.

Lauren, who posts up to six photos a day on the social networking site, said: 'When I was at my biggest I had no confidence. I had always been chunky, but when I left school I worked as a supervisor in a call centre and my weight ballooned.

'In the morning I used to fill a mixing bowl up with Coco Pops. Then at about 11am I would go to McDonald's and have pancakes with a burger and a chocolate milkshake.

'At lunchtime I would go to Subway and get a foot-long sandwich with pepperoni and salami as well as a fizzy drink and cookies.

'We also had a vending machine in the office so I would snack on chocolate bars, then for dinner I would eat an Indian takeaway in the office or I would cook Fray Bentos pies and go to the chippy for chips to put on the side.

Lauren said she would gorge on fast food every day - and tipped the scales at 14 stone before losing weight

'My eating was out of control. I could eat seven hotdogs in one sitting and sometimes I would go to McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was terrible. I wasn't educated in healthy eating. I would drink a lot of fizzy drinks like Coca Cola and Dr Pepper.

'I did notice my weight going up but nobody ever mentioned it to me. Whenever I went on a night out I wore dark, baggy clothes and if I wore high heeled shoes my feet would bleed and blister because of my weight.

'In May 2011 I was on a night out and the next day my friend tagged me in a photo on Facebook. I was horrified. I was massive, my arms were massive. My hair was sweaty and I had really bad skin.

'I was so unfit that I couldn't even walk to the shop without sweating.

'I decided something had to be done, so I swapped takeaways and sweet food for healthy home-cooked meals.'

Lauren said she piled on the pounds when she was pregnant with Mia

Within a matter of months Lauren was able to flaunt her new size 12 figure in fitted clothes, and met her partner Richard Williams, 32.

But when Lauren fell pregnant months later, she found herself going back to her old ways and began eating takeaways and convenience foods.

Lauren said: 'During my pregnancy I started putting on weight again but I didn't really care because I was pregnant. I had gone back to the convenience foods and takeaways.

'At Mia's first birthday party I saw photographs of myself and I decided to join Slimming World.

'At my first class I weighed 14stone 4lb but within four months I had lost over five stone and I felt amazing. I now weigh 9 stone and I'm a size 8.

'Thanks to adopting a healthy lifestyle I have learned how to cook fresh food from scratch, so I thought I would use Instagram to share recipes and diet tips for other people who want to lose weight.

Lauren said she vowed to lose weight after seeing herself in a picture on a night out looking 'bloated'

'I started off by posting family photos and a few recipes, but more and more people started following me and I now have 19,000 followers.

'I share 'before and after' photos of myself to help inspire others and people write lovely comments complimenting me on my achievement. I really believe that if I can lose weight anybody can, and I want to show other people that it is do-able if you put your mind to it.

'I'm a working mum and I understand how hard it can be to stay on track.'

Lauren, whose posts on the social media site get up to 1,300 comments and 'likes', enjoys cooking paella, spaghetti, meatballs and healthy low-fat curries for herself and her family.

'I have completely changed my lifestyle,' she said.

'I love cooking and we never eat frozen food.

'A typical food diary now is a bowl of porridge for breakfast, salad for lunch and a pasta dish or curry for dinner.

'I'm a firm believer in a treat once a week, and I still enjoy meals out with my friends or the odd bit of chocolate every now and then.

'When I go out I wear high heels and my feet don't bleed anymore and my wardrobe is an array of colour.

'I'm a much happier and more confident person now that I have lost weight and I want to inspire other people to feel the same way.'
