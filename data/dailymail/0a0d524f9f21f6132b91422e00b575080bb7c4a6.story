The female orgasm is a sensation that 
many people find complex and perplexing, but one woman claims to have had 11 orgasms in one day using the orgasmic meditation or 'om' method.

Actress Karen Lorre claims orgasmic meditation, or 'OMing' enables her to be more sensitive  - both physically and emotionally - appreciate men and experience multiple orgasms in a day.

OMing is taught in 'orgasmic meditation centres' called OneTaste by long-time practitioner and founder Nicole Daedone.

Actress Karen Lorre (pictured) claims orgasmic meditation, or 'Oming' enables her to be more sensitive and appreciate men as well as to experience up to 11 orgasms in one day

She believes that the orgasm fundamentally 
roots the capacity for connection between people, 'hormonally, 
emotionally and spiritually' and insists that her classes focus on this 
rather than the goal of achieving orgasm.

It is thought that one in 10 women never reach orgasm but Ms Lore is not one of them.

Ms Lorre, 51, from Long Beach California, is a former Playmate and describes herself as a model, 'fun coach and love goddess,' as well as an actress, who has appeared in numerous TV programmes including Cheers and the X-Files.

She told Medical Daily: 'I was already in a place of bliss - I had 
been doing sit down meditation for 20 years but [OMing] opened up my ability 
to sense more and more subtle things and my appreciation for men.'

OMing is a 15-minute practice between two people where both people focus all their attention on the  techniques used and sensations created when bringing a female to orgasm.

In a video of a class, one 'student' called Rachel said she was told at the age of 25 that she could not orgasm but disproved the diagnosis having attended orgasmic meditation classes.

She said: 'I felt a moment of electricity and thought that's what it feels like to be a woman - to be that safe and comfortable with another human being.'

Ms Daedone said the idea of the practice is similar to Buddhist
Tantric sex, which aims is to extend the peak and like conventional 
meditation, oming affects the same parts of the human brain.

While it is possible to 'OM' individually or in private, OneTaste controversially organises 'OM circles', which is the group practice of orgasmic meditation.

The website says partners can set up a 'nest' and have a 15 minute oming session before sharing their experiences.

Dr Pooja Lakshmin, an associate researcher at a Rutgers University who studies orgasms, said: 'The same parts of the brain that are activated during deep meditative states get activated during orgasm.'

She believes the way in which people think about the female orgasm is limited and the mechanics of what happen when a female reaches climax is not fully understood.

Ms Daedone founded the OneTaste centres having had a tantric experience at a friend's party.

Rachel is pictured who said she was told at the age of 25 that she could not orgasm but has since mastered 'Oming'. Nicole Daedone, founding or orgasmic meditation centres, believes orgasm fundamentally roots the capacity for connection between people

She said: 'The experience that I had was everything 
that I had in sitting medication; cosmic connection, bliss, all of those
things.'

She claimed that it was the most profound human connection she had ever experienced.

While Ms Daedone accepts that the idea of Oming and Oming classes might seem strange to many people, she said that while Yoga was unusual in the West 30 years ago, it is now common and orgasmic meditation could become usual activities too.

She established the first centre in San Francisco and now has 10 centres across the world, including a group in London.
