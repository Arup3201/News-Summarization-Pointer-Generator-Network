He's a convicted peeping tom, caught secretly filming young women in the shower with a tiny camera installed in the bathroom ceiling fan, but now will not serve a single day in jail.

Electrician Tristan Wootten was found guilty after he was busted with an elaborate camera set up at a home on the New South Wales Central Coast, north of Sydney, spying on his female tenants.

Wootten was originally sentenced to two years jail after being found guilty of five counts of filming a person in a private act without consent, reported Nine's A Current Affair.

On appeal, that sentence was reduced to 17 months before a district court judge ruled that could be served as an intensive correction order, which means home detention.

One of his victims, Amy Peterson (pictured) says she can't believe he didn't go to jail, with just a 'slap on the wrist' being sent to home detention

His conditions include 32 hours of community service, a program to prevent him from re-offending and he will be subject to random home visits.

Wootten was also found guilty of possessing child pornography, found by police when they discovered his camera set up.

Amy Petersen, 21, was the one who discovered he had been spying on her when she was 18 and another young woman in their home, and can't believe he won't serve time.

'I thought justice would be served but obviously the court system is in favour of the criminals and not the victims,' she told ACA.

It was also discovered Wootten was first deemed unsuitable for an ICO (intensive corrections order) because he had broken up with his girlfriend and had no job or fixed address, according to ACA.

But his lawyer was able to negotiate with the judge for him to be given a second chance, and he was.   

Despite being caught red handed and being found guilty, Wootten has walked free and will now live with his girlfriend.

Ms Petersen wants justice to be served and has started a petition with change.org, calling for the attorney general to step in. 

'Hearing his name still makes me physically sick,' she said in the petition.

'I always thought I would be safe in my own home. He took that away from me, made me terrified and so powerless.'

'A few weeks after my fiance and I moved in we felt like something was wrong, then we found he'd hidden tiny cameras and was watching us shower and undress without our knowledge.'

'It's left me an emotional wreck that I'm not sure I'll ever fully recover from,' she said.

She said a 'slap on the wrist' was 'humiliating and degrading' and is hoping other people will sign her petition, to put a force behind appealing for him to go to jail. 

Over 7,000 people have already put their name to the petition.
