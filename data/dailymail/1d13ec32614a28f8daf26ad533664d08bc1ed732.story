Until their identities were finally uncovered, Harry and Edna were just a long-dead mystery couple, who had left their colorful legacy behind in a vat of abandoned 60-year old photos.

When Chicago-based photographer Jeff Phillips, perusing a thrift store in St. Louis, Missouri, came across 30 boxes, filled with over 1,000 of their photos; he bought them, examined them, and was determined to trace their identities.

He posted the captivating photos to Facebook, and an army of social media detectives cracked it: Harry August Grossmann and Edna Annette Lehr were a Missouri couple who married in 1923 and stayed together until their deaths; Harry in 1986 aged 87, and Edna in 1983 aged 82.

Mystery: Photographer Jeff Phillips found over 1,000 photo slides of a mystery couple in a thrift store, labeled only 'Harry' (right) and 'Edna' (left) - which documented their lives through the 1950s

Social media shout out:  Mr Phillips posted the images to this Facebook page (pictured) in the hopes that perhaps their children would recognize it. In the end,  an unconnected woman  traced them using various clues

It is unclear why no-one claimed Harry and Edna's extensive collection of photos after they died, or how they ended up in a thrift store.

But the images tell the story of an adventurous couple very much in love, who traveled the world, attended fine parties and had many friends. It later transpired that they bore no children and stayed together for the rest of their lives.

When Mr Phillips first stumbled across the photos, he was transfixed. They were in Kodachrome slide format - a process which was phased out in the 1970s - with scribbled clues accompanying them. Some dated back to the 1940s, but most of them to the 1950s.

Solved: Globetrotters Harry August Grossmann and Edna Annette Lehr (pictured in Alaska in 1958) were a Missouri couple who married in 1923 and were together until their deaths

Whatever the weather: The couple's identity was traced by Jennifer Edinger from Seattle, Washington, who studied the locations that featured, among other clues. Pictured, Edna in a snap  simply labeled 'boat'

Touching: Harry (left) and Edna (right) appear to have enjoyed a long and happy marriage, Harry dying in 1986 aged 87 and Edna in 1983 aged 82. Pictured, an unlabeled snap of their 35th wedding anniversary 

Mr Phillips posted the images to a Facebook page he created called Is This Your Mother? - assuming that perhaps the couple had children and grandchildren who might recognize their faces.

After scouring clues - everything from the couple's clothing and car license plates to road signs and landmarks in the background of their photos - the mystery was solved.

A swift three weeks after Mr Phillips had first enlisted social media to help with his search, a woman named Jennifer Edinger from Seattle, Washington sent him the following email:

'Harry August Grossmann and Edna Annette Lehr. Edna died in 1983. Harry passed away three years later.'

Pigeon party: It later transpired that the couple never had children, but do have living great nieces and nephews. Pictured, Harry larking around on one of their many adventures 

Fun: The heartwarming photos Harry and Edna left behind were in Kodachrome slide format, a photography process which was phased out in the 1970s. Pictured, Edna in St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy

Very matching: Harry took a number of pictures at the couple's home in the affluent village of Frontenac, St Louis, including this one of Edna, dated October 1952

Ms Edinger, a stranger to Mr Phillips with a hobby for tracing lineage, had pulled the conclusion together from a frenzied bout of detective work, based on various clues from the photos.

Following this, Mr Phillips tracked down several of Harry and Edna's extended family members; all of whom were very intrigued and supportive of his project, including a great niece called Maria.

Maria sent an email to Mr Phillips, which reads: 'You have gone to great lengths to find our family and it is heartwarming and a little creepy (in a fun way) to see how interested others are in my Great Aunt and Uncle.'

A peek into the past: Harry reclines on the deck of a cruise ship, looking very cheerful indeed

Nautical nonsense: Edna (left) sporting a very jolly hat as she grins for a photo, while an extremely relaxed fellow sunbather (right) soaks up the rays close-by 

So many vacations: Edna (pictured on a mystery boat) worked as a bookkeeper for a sheet metal company and both she and Harry, who worked in the same industry, reportedly did well for themselves

Nice gear: From what we can tell, it appears that Harry (pictured) had a willing nature and a good sense of humor 

It has since been discovered that Harry was in the sheet metal business. He listed himself as an 'employer' on his 1940 census. Edna was a bookkeeper, also in the sheet metal industry.

They were both successful in their careers according to Mr Phillips, and for many years lived in the affluent village of Frontenac, St Louis, in Missouri, where a lot of the photos were taken.

Three years after he first found the photos, Mr Phillips curated a photography show made up from Harry and Edna's photos entitled Lost and Found, which just ended at the Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, in Chicago.

Snow dome: Mr Phillips found this unmarked photo of the couple (pictured) in a box titled 'Alaska' 

Why not a reindeer? Edna visits Santa's grotto during one of the couple's numerous trips to Alaska, upstaged in this case by a rogue goat

Changing landscapes: Edna commemorates a trip to Cyprus Gardens, a botanical garden and theme park near Winter Haven, Florida, which closed down in 2009 and has now been incorporated into Legoland Florida

Buddies: This snap of some fellow-vacationers at the El Rancho Hotel in Haiti (top) was dated 1961, making it one of the most recent images discovered. Mr Phillips has zoomed in on some of the faces (bottom)

Harry and Edna may be long gone, but Mr Phillips' project triggered some interesting observations about the nature of our world here and now.

'Harry's slides from the 1950s were nearly lost forever,' he tells MailOnline. 'When slide film as a format became obsolete, the slides were discarded because no one had a projector to view them with.'

He adds: 'I'm asking viewers to consider whether our digital preservation habits will prevent history from repeating itself.'

Indeed, now that our own photo histories are largely captured, shared, and stored not in print, or even on discs, but on gigantic social media servers, could they ever really be 'lost?'

A feast for the eyes: This floral-themed image of Edna (left) and Harry (right) was labeled '25th Anniversary,' and was dated 1948

Candid moment: Edna, looking older than in many of the other photos, puts her feet up in the cabin of an unidentified vessel

Close: 'Harry's slides were nearly lost forever,' Mr Philiips says. 'When slide film became obsolete, the slides were discarded because no one had a projector to view them with.' Pictured, Painted Desert, Arizona 1955

Mr Phillips' project also prompted him to question why so many strangers flocked to the Facebook page, and put so much genuine effort into uncloaking Harry and Edna's identities.

'It seemed as though they wanted to ensure that the couple's memories were preserved,' he remarks. 

'I suspect that the interest in this story reflects on worries about our own mortality: when the last photograph of us is discarded, is that when we're truly forgotten?'

One Facebook user commented on a photo of Edna: 'I have no children, and I have often wondered if anyone will ever care that I was on planet earth. I can relate to Edna.' 

Crossroads: Mr Phillips asks viewers to consider whether or not our digital preservation habits will prevent our own photos getting lost forever, as Harry and Edna's almost were. Pictured, Edna, undated

Where is he off to? According to Mr Phillips, there are 'hundreds' of mystery portraits of Harry (pictured) posing next to structures similar to this 

Partners for life: After this shot was taken, in Maui, Hawaii, it is likely that Harry sat down next to his wife in their matching wicker seats and simply watched the world go by

One heck of a party: Nothing is known about this undated photo, but it does imply that Harry and Edna (not pictured) had a healthy social life

Life's a beach: This is one of the few shots that could almost be mistaken for a modern day Instagram snap

Strangers: This photo of an unknown couple was found in a box labeled 'miscellaneous,' the slide damaged by liquid and mold

Ladies man: Harry (center) poses with four cheery looking ladies as they all clutch ice cream cones 

A clue! Edna and the couple's rental car at the El Tovar Hotel near the Grand Canyon, Arizona in 1957, which still stands remarkably unchanged to this day. Details like this were useful for social media detectives

Farewell: Mr Phillips suspects that the reason so many people were desperate to identify Harry and Edna, was a fear of their own mortality, and of one day being lost from history themselves
