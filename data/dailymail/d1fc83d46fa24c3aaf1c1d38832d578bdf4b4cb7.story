Bungling police mistakenly handed lethal firearms back to a man they had charged with illegally possessing them.

Officers had stormed John Charlton’s home and seized three deadly weapons and some drugs.

Charlton, known as Chuck, was charged with three counts of possessing firearms without a certificate and bailed.

Officers stormed John Charlton's home and seized three illegal firearms - but then handed them back to him

But when he went to Wallsend police station to pick up his belongings, he was handed back the cache of weapons which had been seized from him.

Today police admitted they made an error, while Charlton said they were lucky he wasn't a danger to society.

Charlton pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court to possessing three firearms without a certificate and possessing amphetamine

The 33-year-old, who collects military memorabilia, said: 'I think this is disgraceful by the police and there needs to be answers and sackings, this is misconduct by the police.

'What happens if they made that mistake and gave it to someone like that daft Raoul Moat? I’m no angel but it could have been a lot worse if someone else had got them.

'Those weapons are deadly, they could kill someone from a long distance.'

Charlton said he had only gone back to the police station to pick up his phone and other personal belongings.

But he said the official he spoke offered him the guns as well.

He said: 'He said there was a bag full of property, my phone, the guns, everything. I said "My guns are here?" and he said "Yeah, do you want them?" I said "Yes".

'I didn’t ask for them. But if the police offer you them back you think it must be alright.'

Charlton said he took the weapons but disposed of them, fearing more charges.

He said: 'They made me commit another offence by giving me the guns back.

'When I turned up at court it was said the guns were in the stores but the police said they are not there and there has been a massive mistake.'

Married Charlton, a father-of-seven, said he bought the air weapons believing they were legal.

However the previous owner had ramped up the power to three times the legal limit, meaning they are classed as illegal firearms.

He said: 'I would not have bought them if I knew they were illegal. I pleaded guilty straight away on that basis.'

Charlton said he is a military historian with a collection of medals.

He said: 'I’m a war historian but I’ll stick to my medals from now on.'

Charlton, of Amble, Northumberland, originally from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court to possessing three firearms without a certificate and possessing amphetamine.

He was given a 12-month suspended prison sentence.

Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Steve Neill acknowledged that the firearms seized were returned in error.

He said: 'We are currently investigating how this occurred and what lessons we can learn from this incident.'
