Thai authorities have banned
beach parties on some holiday islands to stop gatherings that
can get out of control and lead to violence after the murder of
two British backpackers last month, an official said on Monday.

The bodies of Britons Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David
Miller, 24, were discovered a beach on the tourist island of Koh
Tao, or Turtle Island, on Sept. 15. Two Myanmar men have been
arrested and charged with the murders.

Chatpong Chatputhi, governor of Surat Thani province which
includes Koh Tao, said all beach parties would be banned with
the exception of a Full Moon Party on Phangan island, following negative publicity after the murders.

'We've reached a point where we need to clean up the image
of tourism in the province including beach parties that can get
out of control and lead to violence,' Chatpong told Reuters.

'This is aimed at tourists' safety. Sometimes these parties
are held at secluded locations that are difficult to reach and
where we cannot offer adequate protection.'

The ban on parties covers all islands in the province which,
as well as Koh Tao and Koh Phangan, includes Koh Samui. Chatpong
said authorities on the islands were taking down posters
advertising parties.

'Some people who come to the islands want peace and quiet
but there are all sorts of parties,' he said.

Police said the arrested men (pictured) had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves

Scotland Yard murder detectives have travelled in secret to a Thai island where two British backpackers were brutally murdered amid concerns two Burmese bar workers may have been wrongly arrested in connection with their deaths

'This is also because of the killings on Koh Tao ... It's
time to put things in order.'

Police say Witheridge and Miller had been out drinking and
went to a secluded stretch of beach where they were killed.

Their murders have dented Thailand's tourism industry, which
accounts for nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product, at a
time when the sector is struggling to recover from months of
political unrest and a May 22 coup.

The police investigation has been tainted by suspicion the
two Myanmar suspects may have been tortured during
interrogation. Thailand's human rights commission has opened an
inquiry into allegations of police torture.

But the Full Moon Party that attracts thousands of young
foreigners every month, as well as its share of bad publicity,
had dodged the ban as it was well organised, Chatpong said.
