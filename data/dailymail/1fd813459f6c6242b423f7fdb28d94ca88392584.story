The World Cup winner in England’s midst is hoping to use the example of his previous charges as evidence that even unfancied teams can go all the way.

Paul Farbrace was the coach who guided Sri Lanka to both the World Twenty20 title and Asia Cup last year before being targeted by Paul Downton to work alongside Peter Moores in the new England regime.

Now, having made an excellent impression in his first summer as assistant coach, he is hoping to bring his limited-overs expertise to an England team who have been starved of 50-over success for far too long.

‘I wouldn’t sit here now and say we’re going to win the World Cup,’ said Farbrace at the WACA after England’s gruelling training session in the extreme heat of Western Australia. ‘But what I would say is that if you get through to the knockout stages then anything is possible.

‘My experience with Sri Lanka is that we went into our final group game of the World Twenty20 against New Zealand and we struggled with the bat. 

'But we ended up winning the game and then did the same against West Indies when Duckworth Lewis went our way. All of a sudden we were in the final.

‘Our aim now is to get to the quarter-finals of the World Cup and then anything can happen. People have said we’ve got no chance and they can think what they want but we know we’re improving all the time, we’re working really hard and we want to give ourselves the best chance we possibly can.’

Certainly the structure of another elongated World Cup should benefit England. They may be in the tougher of the two groups but all they really need to do is beat Scotland and Afghanistan to reach the last eight.

They have already been told their quarter-final will be in Melbourne which means there is no real benefit in winning the group. And as long as they make the last eight they will probably meet Pakistan, West Indies, India or South Africa and only the last of those teams would be a really big obstacle to the semi-finals.

India may be the defending champions but they are not looking like it in Australia. They are already weary having lost a Test series here and seemed uninterested when they were thrashed by England in the Tri-series in Brisbane.

Their rained-off match against Australia in Sydney means that India’s second clash with England here at the WACA on Friday becomes a winner takes all affair but Eoin Morgan’s side have good reason to be optimistic of reaching Sunday’s final against Australia.

While England worked hard India were nowhere to be seen and apparently they have no plans to train again on Wednesday, apparently because it’s too hot here in Perth. Yet Friday’s match will be played during the day so they will have no way of avoiding the 40 degrees plus temperature then.

‘India’s washout didn’t help us in theory but it’s probably want we want because it makes Friday effectively a semi-final,’ said Farbrace. ‘We want to put the boys under pressure and that’s what they will be on Friday.

‘Let’s be honest, we’ve talked a lot about development and improvement but winning is the key and this is a chance for us to win a game and give ourselves another chance against Australia before the World Cup starts.'

India looked like a team who had never played on a pitch with bounce at the Gabba and those conditions should be even more apparent at the WACA.

‘They’re the best two grounds we could have played India on,’ said Farbrace. ‘I think our bowlers will be running in excited about bowling on here. We watched the Big Bash game here on Sunday and it was exciting to see the ball flying through.’

Steven Finn has also been rediscovering some of his best form as England warm up for the World Cup

That will put the onus on an England bowling attack led by Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who are still returning to their best after injury. 

‘They’re not far away and I think every game back helps,’ said Farbrace.

‘Steven Finn and Chris Woakes have done well too. Woakesy is a sign of where we are as a team. At the start of last summer he wasn’t in the team and now he’s almost one of our first picks. 

'By playing consistently and with the selectors backing him he’s growing in confidence and his performances have improved. That’s what’s happening to the team as well.’

Quietly England are coming together here. And wins against India and, finally, Australia are needed now to prove it.
