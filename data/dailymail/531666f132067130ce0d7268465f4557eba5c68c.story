Many will be pleased at having an extra hour in bed tomorrow as the first cold snap of the season arrived 'with a bang' just in time for the clocks being put back.

Some parts of the UK have been as cold as Moscow this weekend as the winter chill brought temperatures below freezing.

And forecasters warn the brisk weather conditions are here to stay as winter has finally arrived.

Met forecaster Helen Roberts said: 'Winter has certainly arrived with a bang this weekend as the clocks are due to go back.

'It has been a pretty cold day across the country with temperatures in many places below freezing this morning.

'The temperatures will be slightly warmer on Sunday but it will still feel very cold as cloud and rain will cover much of the country.

'It will remain cold in the beginning of next week but by Wednesday we are expecting very wet and windy conditions that will stay for several days.'

It comes after early snow brought chaos on the roads today with a lorry jack-knifed during blizzard conditions on the A1 in County Durham causing a six-mile tailback of traffic.

Northern counties yesterday saw the 
first snow of winter and last night temperatures in southern England were 
expected to fall to a chilly -2C.

Hundreds
of gritters were on standby to treat roads around the country as forecasters warned some areas were as cold as Moscow.

Victoria Kettley, a forecaster for 
MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'We 
can't rule out more wintry showers - these might fall as snow very 
locally on high ground like the North York Moors, but will generally be 
sleet, rain or hail.

'Temperatures will be between about 7C and 10C, and in central Scotland overnight won't get above 4C or 5C.'

Councils in England and Wales have 
stockpiled 1.3million ton of salt for gritting roads – enough to fill 
more than 400 Olympic-sized swimming pools and twice as much as was used
last winter.

There was snow on the ground in 
Scotland and Northumberland yesterday, leaving a dusting on fields and 
pavements as temperatures dipped below zero.

A
Met Office spokesman said yesterday the snow was falling much earlier 
than last year, when snowflakes were not reported until December.

Charlie
Powell, a spokesman for the Met Office said: 'Some parts of the country
are as cold as Moscow. Those in Northumberland are experiencing temperatures between 3 and 4C.

'Overnight temperatures could drop to as low as -2C with a frosty start to the day tomorrow for many.

'In
the north east there could be 2cm of snow today and parts of northern 
Scotland could see up to 5cm of snow throughout the next 24 hours.

'Parts of Lincolnshire and East Anglia could see sleet and hail showers today but I don't think we will see anything settling.

'We
are experiencing a two day cold snap today and tomorrow. On Monday it 
will be back to wet and windy and temperatures where they should be, as 
high as 4 and 6C.'

Thankfully, the weather is not yet quite as bad as in the U.S., where a state of emergency was declared today.

Officials in New York and New Jersey warned the already-killer Hurricane Sandy barrelling toward the East coast will be the worst case scenario.

Tony Conlan, a forecaster with MeteoGroup UK, the weather division of the Press Association, said some areas of lower ground in Scotland saw their first meaningful snow, and a 'wintry mix' of rain, sleet, hail and some snow will continue until late on Saturday.

'It will be colder today than it has been, with temperatures typically ranging from 2C (36F) in parts of the Scottish highlands to 10 or 11C (50-52F) in the far west of England' he said.

'Late on Saturday night there should 
be milder air coming in from the north west making it warmer on Sunday, 
but still not very pleasant, with rain just about everywhere.'

The Local Government Association (LGA) said that hundreds of gritters are on standby to treat roads as required on the last day of British Summer Time before the clocks go back.

An LGA survey of councils across 
England and Wales found there is currently about 1.3 million tonnes of 
salt in council depots - enough to fill more than 400 Olympic-sized 
swimming pools.

This is about twice as much as was used during last winter.

A spokesman said: 'Councils have invested in new fleets of GPS-tracked gritting trucks, mini-gritters and specialist vehicles for narrow and hilly streets.

'Thousands of grit bins have been placed in estates and side streets, residents have been given their own bags of salt along with salt spreaders in some neighbourhoods, and arrangements have been made with parish councils, farmers and community groups to grit hard-to-reach areas.'

Couple Helen and Jamie Sims stopped near to Kielder Forest in Northumberland so they could enjoy the pretty scenes as they drove from their home in Edinburgh to London.

Helen said: 'We’re originally from 
New Zealand so we haven’t seen much snow before. We weren’t expecting it
so we stopped the car to enjoy the view.'

Janet
Julian and her sister Margaret Brennan also stopped on their drive from
South Yorkshire as they made their way to a holiday cottage in Fife.

Janet said: 'We drive this route because it’s scenic, the snow is like an added bonus.'

Thousands of migrating birds have been dying before reaching England this week because of an appalling combination of fog and winds around the coast.

Fishermen have discovered many exhausted and disorientated 'garden' birds plunging into the sea around their vessels, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).

England's east coast, from Northumberland to Kent, has seen the arrival of many birds, including redwings, fieldfares, bramblings and blackbirds, perhaps numbering in their millions.

The charity said these were the lucky survivors which had managed to cross the North Sea, but many others might have perished before making landfall.

The skipper of a boat said: 'While fishing about 10 miles south of Portsmouth, we witnessed thousands of garden birds disorientated, land on the sea and most drowning.

'Species included goldcrests, robins, thrushes and blackbirds. The sky was thick with garden birds. I estimate I saw 500 birds die and that was just in our 300-yard sphere.'

Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director, said: 'The scale of these reports is truly shocking, and it has the potential to adversely affect the status of species which may be declining for other reasons.'
