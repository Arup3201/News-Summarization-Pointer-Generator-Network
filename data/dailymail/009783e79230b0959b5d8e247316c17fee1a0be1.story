A drunk woman was taken to hospital after climbing into an elephant enclosure at Denver Zoo where she was shocked by an electric fence. 

The woman, described an 'extremely intoxicated', entered the enclosure at about 9pm on yesterday during the zoo's annual Christmas lights switch on. 

A police statement said: 'At around 8.55pm on December 23, 2013, Denver Zoo security was alerted that a disoriented woman was found inside an animal yard in the zoo's Toyota Elephant Passage exhibit.

'The woman was transported for medical care. Denver police and Denver zoo are talking to guests to determine what happened.'

The woman is believed to have sat on electrical wires which gave her a shock. She was treated for minor injuries at the scene. 

In a post on Twitter, the Denver Police Department said: 'No electrocution. Extremely intoxicated female entered elephant pen at zoo & sat down next to electrical wires.'
