A seven-year-old boy was killed when a heavy goods vehicle collided with the car he was travelling in. 

The youngster was sitting in a silver Toyota which was driving on an A-road in Buckinghamshire when it collided with a blue DAF lorry.

Paramedics and an air ambulance crew raced to the scene but the youngster was declared dead at the scene. 

The seven-year-old boy died following the collision on the Stoke Hammond by-pass in Buckinghamshire

Three people were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with serious injuries and the road was closed for several hours while investigators gathered evidence.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'At 2.17pm yesterday on the A4146 Stoke Hammond bypass near the junction with the B4032 Leighton Road a silver Toyota RAV 4 was involved in a collision with a blue DAF lorry. The collision occurred on the south bound dual carriageway.

'Sadly a 7-year-old boy, who was a passenger in the car, died at the scene.'

A fire service spokesman said that seven appliances had attended the incident, where firefighters used hydraulic rescue equipment to release three injured women from the vehicles.

A man, thought to be the lorry driver, escaped from his vehicle uninjured before fire crews arrived.

Police constable Sandra Terry said: 'This is a very sad case where a young boy has lost his life.

'We are in the process of investigating the circumstances which led to these tragic consequences and so would urge anyone who was in the area before this time and saw the incident itself or who had seen either vehicle prior to the collision to please contact us as a matter of urgency.'

A 33-year-old man from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and bailed while the investigation continues.

Anyone with information on the collision is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101.
