This mum's prankster son sure knows how to take advantage of her jumpy nature.

Chronicling his best six scares, the boy, called Raphael, has created a compilation video of his most successful spooks.

In the first stunt, Raphael spots his mum at the sink in the bathroom, creeps up behind her and screams, which causes her to shriek in response.

The boy, called Raphael, put together a compilation video of his best scare tactics 

Next, he shocks her while she's talking on the phone and washing up for supper.

His mum is so surprised that she screams, nearly drops the phone and turns around ready to throw a vegetable at the supposed intruder.

By the fourth fright, the mother turns to her son and exasperatedly asks him to stop - to no avail. 

Raphael sneaks up on his mother everywhere from the bathroom to the kitchen causing her to shriek in fright

Eventually the exasperated woman asks her son to stop - with little luck
