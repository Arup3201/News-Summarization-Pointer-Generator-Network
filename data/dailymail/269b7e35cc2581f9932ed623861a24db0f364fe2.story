A mother forced her teenage daughter into prostitution after they started doing drugs together when the girl was just 12, police have said.

Suzanne Bobbie Calana, 37, was arrested in Miami, Florida last week after another young girl under investigation for prostitution tipped off police.

Her daughter, who is now 16, had been put in the custody of her grandmother after her mother lost her legal parental rights following a long line of drug arrests, the Miami Herald reported.

But in May, the girl ran away to live with her mother on the streets and became addicted to cocaine, crack cocaine and Xanax, she told police.

Accused: Suzanne Bobbie Calana, 37, allegedly started taking drugs with her daughter when the girl was just 12 and often committed sex acts for money in front of her, teaching her about prostitution, the girl said

She turned to prostitution and sometimes sold her body to give Calana money for drugs. 

'The victim explained that she learned about prostitution from her mother,' an arrest report said.

'The victim recalled instances where her and her mother engaged in sexual activities with men, while in the same room, in exchange for money.'

Calana then allowed her daughter to move in with suspected drug dealer Lawrence Martin, 43, who is also known as 'Paper', police said.

'Pimp': She allowed her daughter to move in with Lawrence Martin, pictured, who then demanded the girl earn at least $150 a day, police said. He also allegedly had sex with the teenager and gave her drugs

Martin, who was also Calana's pimp, allegedly forced the teenager to earn at least $150 a day, and also had sex with her and gave her drugs, according to the arrest report. 

He was also arrested last week.

Calana and Martin are charged with human trafficking of a minor, furnishing drugs to a minor and interfering with custody.

'Every time you've think you've seen the worst case, another one comes along that is hard to believe,' Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told the Herald.

Calana's defense attorney declined to comment.
