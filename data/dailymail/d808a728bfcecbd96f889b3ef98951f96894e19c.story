David Cameron yesterday dismissed a Labour call for him to apologise for Margaret Thatcher’s handling of the miners’ strike – insisting militant union leader Arthur Scargill should say sorry for his ‘appalling’ conduct.

The Prime Minister reacted with bemusement to Labour’s launch of a ‘justice for the coalfields’ campaign demanding a fresh inquiry into the strike and a formal apology from the Government.

The opposition says recently-released Cabinet papers relating to the 30-year-old dispute show the Thatcher government had a secret plan to close 75 pits and put pressure on police to crack down on pickets.

David Cameron refused to issue an apology for the Thatcher government's handling of the miner's strike, but suggester then-union leader Arthur Scargill should say sorry

Labour MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy insisted at Prime Minister’s Questions that miners and their families deserved an apology.

‘The scars of that dispute run deep in communities like Wigan,’ she said.

‘Some families have never recovered and others have died waiting for justice.’

But Mr Cameron rejected the call, saying: ‘I think if anyone needs to 
make an apology for their role in the miners’ strike it should be Arthur
 Scargill for the appalling way that he led  that union.’

The opposition’s campaign is apparently designed to boost support in the Labour heartlands.

However
 it has horrified some Labour MPs who are warning it appears the party 
is backing Mr Scargill, a hate figure for most voters, in a 30-year-old 
argument.

Shadow Cabinet 
Office minister, Michael Dugher raised the issue in the Commons, 
challenging ministers to set out ‘all details of the interactions 
between the Government and the police at the time’.

He made his appeal in the wake of the National Archives' release of Cabinet papers from the 1980s which indicated that the Thatcher government had secret plans to close 75 pits and considered sending in troops to break the strike.

The Barnsley East MP, who has launched a Justice for the Coalfields campaign, particularly wants communications relating to the confrontation between miners and police at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire.

He called for action before the 30th anniversary of the so-called Battle of Orgreave on July 18.

But Tory Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude rejected the idea out of hand, insisting all of the relevant documents will be released 'in the usual way' under the law that was passed by the last Labour government.

He added: 'I was representing a coal mining constituency during the miners' strike. I saw first-hand the violence, the intimidation, the divided communities, in a dispute that took place without a proper national ballot being held. So you asked for an apology - no.'

Later at Prime Minister's Questions Mr
 Cameron went further and said Labour should also learn lessons from the
 strikes as former party leader Lord Kinnock at the time refused to 
condemn the fact there was no ballot.

He
 told MPs: 'I have to say, I think if anyone needs to make an apology 
for their role in the miners' strike it should be Arthur Scargill for 
the appalling way that he led that union.

'I
 think while we are at it, if other people want to ask about their 
roles, there was the role of the leader of Labour Party, who at the time
 never condemned the fact that they wouldn't hold a ballot. So I think 
there are lessons for Labour to learn and judging from their performance
 today, they haven't learned any of them.'

Labour claims that there should be a ‘proper investigation’ into the ugliest confrontation of the strike in 1984, when 10,000 striking miners clashed with 5,000 police officers in what became known as the Battle of Orgreave.

Lord Tebbit, who was Baroness 
Thatcher’s trade and industry secretary during the strike, dismissed 
Labour’s ‘justice for the coalfields’ campaign as absurd.

‘Next
 they’ll want an apology for freeing the Falklands,’ the Conservative 
peer said. ‘I presume Ed Miliband is doing this in order to get some 
more money from Unite [the union].

‘My
 recollection is that the police were principally used to protect miners
 who wanted to go to work and who had not been granted a ballot, but 
were being prevented from doing so by [National Union of Mineworkers 
leader] Arthur Scargill’s hate mob.

‘Neither Labour nor Scargill has ever apologised for that.’

Lord Tebbit added: ‘I trust the Government will merely laugh at this ridiculous campaign.’

It is likely to cause unease among the dwindling band of Blairite Labour MPs, who will fear that the party risks alienating Middle England by appearing to back Mr Scargill in a 30-year-old argument.

The move comes after the release of Cabinet papers earlier this month showing that Lady Thatcher came within days of declaring a state of emergency and calling out the military four months into the miners’ strike.

Ministers secretly discussed recalling Parliament in the summer of 1984 to pass emergency legislation, according to documents released to the National Archives.

The files show that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal, but the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic.

Labour says the papers also suggest that the Thatcher government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs and that it sought to influence police tactics to escalate the dispute.

Industrial action was triggered in March 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits. Mr Scargill went into battle with the Tories and a year-long war of attrition ensued.

Mr Dugher, MP for the former pit town of Barnsley, where Mr Scargill was born, said: ‘For those of us who lived through the strike and who saw the events and impact they had first hand, what was revealed in the Cabinet papers may not come as a surprise.

‘But it is no less shocking to consider that, far from being neutral, as was claimed at the time, it is clear that the Government took a deliberately calculated political approach guided by a complete hostility to the coalfield communities.

‘That is why I am calling for justice for the coalfields.’

He added: ‘Ministers may want to sweep these events under the carpet, but the scars of the dispute and the subsequent closure programme remain on the memories, communities and landscapes of all coalfield communities.

‘They must now apologise and deliver transparency to begin to foster reconciliation with the coalfield communities.’
