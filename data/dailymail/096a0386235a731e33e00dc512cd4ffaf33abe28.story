Downing too many glasses of fizzy drink doesn't just make you fat - it could also make your dodgy knees worse.

Researchers studied patients suffering from osteoarthritis in their knees, which is a common degenerative condition affecting six million older adults in the UK.

They found that the more soft drinks patients consumed, the faster their condition progressed. Slim men were found to be particularly affected.

Sugary drinks could make knee osteoarthritis worse - a condition that affects most adults over 60

Study leader Dr Bing Lu from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said: 'Little is known about the course of 
disability over time in patients with osteoarthritis.

'This study may offer the 
potential to identify a modifiable dietary risk factor for disease 
progression, enable evaluation of prevailing recommendations of healthy 
diet, and thus have potential public health implications.'

Sugary drinks joins the other known risk factors including obesity, aging and joint stress.

For the study, researcher looked at data on 2,149 patients who had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis following an X-ray.

At the beginning of the study, each participant's soft-drink consumption, not including sugar-free drinks was measured using a Food Frequency Questionnaire.

The researcher followed up with the participants 12, 24, 36 and 48 months later to track their OA progression as measured by joint space change in their medial knee compartments.

Body mass index (a measure of obesity) was also measured and tracked and data for men and women were analysed separately.

After controlling for BMI and other factors that may contribute to knee OA, men who consumed more soft drinks per week had worse progression of their condition.

The joint space became narrower by an average of 0.29 millimeters in men who drank no soft drinks to 0.59 millimeters in men who drank more than five soft drinks a week.

Men classed as normal weight saw their knees get worse than men who were overweight or obese. By contrast, only women of normal weight showed an association between more soft-drink consumption and knee OA progression.

The researchers concluded that the more soft drinks men drink, the worse their knees may get.

It is unclear whether this problem is due to high-calorie soft drinks leading to excess weight burdening knees, or if there are other ingredients in soft drinks that contribute to OA progression.
