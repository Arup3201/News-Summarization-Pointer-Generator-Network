West End theatres, including prestige names such as the Old Vic, have been warned to stop duping the public by failing to declare rip-off fees.

People making online bookings to see Kiss Me Kate or A Chorus of Disapproval, which starred Rob Brydon and Ashley Jensen, were hit with unexpected charges.

Most prime West End theatre tickets are ruinously expensive, with some costing more than £100 each.

On notice: West End theatres, including prestige names such as the Old Vic (pictured), have been warned to stop duping the public by failing to declare rip-off fees

Theatres and agencies do try to tempt people with promises of some cheap tickets, perhaps starting at just £10 for a seat miles from the action.

However, a transaction fee, which typically ranges from £1.50 to £3, is generally not added to the bill until the final online check-out.

While some companies go further and impose a £4 per seat booking fee on top in a manoeuvre that renders the official ticket price meaningless.

Now the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has put theatres and ticket agencies on notice that they should declare all compulsory charges at the beginning of the booking process.

It is issuing a ruling today against the
Old Vic, the giant Ambassador Theatre Group, which trades under ATG 
Tickets, the AKA Group, and the Charing Cross Theatre.

Rip-off fees: The Advertising Standards Authority says theatres and ticket agencies should declare all compulsory charges at the beginning of the online booking process

The Old Vic was promoting tickets for Trevor Nunn’s revival of Kiss Me Kate at prices of £16 to £70 without clearly declaring a booking fee of £1.50 for online purchases and £2.50 via telephone.

ATG claims to be the UK’s biggest specialist theatre ticket agency, while it also produces shows as well as owning and managing several West End theatres.

The company is currently taking bookings for the new musical The Book of Mormon, however consumers must pay a booking fee of £4 per ticket plus a one-off transaction fee of £3.

Consequently, someone buying four of the cheapest tickets for £27.50 each, which have a face value of £110, would actually end up paying £19 extra.

The AKA Group advertised 100 tickets for every performance of A Chorus of Disapproval at £10, however it failed to clearly spell out there was an extra £3 transaction levy per booking.

The Charing Cross Theatre was also guilty of the same confusion by failing to declare a booking fee of £2.

The advertising watchdog has no power to outlaw the fees, however it can name and shame companies which fail to declare them or mislead consumers.

A spokesman said: ‘The ASA is clamping down on hidden costs which are misleading and unfair.

‘Today’s rulings about advertised prices for theatre tickets make clear that sellers must be up-front about extra fees like admin charges right from the beginning.

‘Our priority now is to make sure that this is followed by all ticket retailers, so there are no more hidden costs.’ 

All the theatres and companies censured by the ASA have agreed to change their websites to declare all compulsory fees at the beginning of the ticket purchase process.
