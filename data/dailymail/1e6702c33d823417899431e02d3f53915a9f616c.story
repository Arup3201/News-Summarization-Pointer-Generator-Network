Houston police have arrested a man in the abduction of a 6-year-old girl who escaped after going into a Target store and alerting a customer that she was kidnapped.

Police say 23-year-old Joaquin Ramos was captured early Thursday and is charged with kidnapping.

Investigators say the child, identified as Kelly Tellez, did not appear harmed during the harrowing one-hour ordeal, which played out Wednesday afternoon when she was snatched from her apartment complex.

The Houston man was apprehended this morning at a local hospital where, according to police, his pregnant wife was in labor.

Tellez’s aunt, Marlene Fernandez, told the station KHOU11 that she was glad Ramos had been caught, adding that the 23-year-old will soon get him comeuppance.

‘He’s going to pay in jail because we already know what they do to guys like that in jail,’ Miss Fernandez said.

According to Houston police, Kelly and her mother pulled into a parking garage at around 3.30pm Wednesday, and her mother proceeded to unload her vehicle. 

The 6-year-old went to look at some ice on a fence nearby when a man later identified as Joaquin Ramos pulled up in his silver Jeep Cherokee, forced the child into the backseat against her will and took off.

Tellez’s mother attempted to pursue the kidnapper on foot before returning to the garage and giving chase in her vehicle, but she quickly lost sight of the man. 

Shortly after 4pm, Ramos was captured on a surveillance camera entering the Target store at Memorial City Mall with the abducted girl.

Police say Ramos told Kelly he needed to use the restroom and instructed her to do the same. Once in a bathroom, the 6-year-old told a stranger that she had been kidnapped.

The customer informed store management, who went into the restroom and rescued Kelly Tellez, but Ramos escaped the store before authorities were able to arrest him.

Little Kelly was taken to Texas Children’s Hospital as a precaution before being reunited with her family.

Good news: The 6-year-old was reunited with her mother, who lost her husband in a tragic wood chipper accident just months earlier

Meanwhile, the suspect’s relatives saw photos of him and his Jeep on the news that night and contacted investigators with information on Ramos’ whereabouts.

Just before 5am, police officers apprehended Ramos at Memorial Hermann Hospital, where his wife had just given birth hours earlier.

Ramos allegedly confessed to kidnapping the girl, whom he said he did not know. He did not provide a motive to the abduction.

Kelly's aunt, Marlene Fernandez, said her sister lost her husband in a wood chipper accident just a few months ago, and if something were to happen to her daughter she would have 'gone insane.'

ABC13 reported that Ramos lived in the same apartment complex as Tellez and her mother. His criminal record includes only a sole misdemeanor shoplifting arrest.
