America's only black senator was not invited to participate in the historic 50th anniversary of the March on Washington event, it has emerged.

Tim Scott, a Republican Representative appointed by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley earlier this year, was noticeably absent from the Let Freedom Ring line-up.

Scott was chosen to fill former Senator Jim DeMint's seat in the U.S. Senate after he retired.

African-American leaders who did speak at the day commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.'s resounding 'I Have a Dream' included Georgia Democratic Representative John Lewis, who participated in the original March, Martin Luther King III, MSNBC host Al Sharpton and movie stars Jamie Foxx, Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker.

A spokesman for Scott said: 'The senator believes today is a day to remember the extraordinary accomplishments and sacrifices of Dr King, Congressman John Lewis and an entire generation of black leaders. Today's anniversary should simply serve as an opportunity to reflect upon how their actions moved our country forward in a remarkable way.'

Scott was among a parade of current and former elected officials who issued remarks calling for greater racial equality and praising King Jr's., saying he was 'living my mother's American Dream.'

USA Today columnist DeWayne Wickham said there was no real reason for Scott to be there in the first place.

Speaking on CNN's The Lead he said: 'And he should have been invited why? He should have been invited to speak for what reason? He's one of 50 Senators. And he's appointed not elected.'

Others suggested it was a partisan move by the administration.

President Barack Obama used the important day to urge America to continue fighting for the equal nation Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned.

Speaking from beneath the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., the president celebrated how far America has come since Dr King's speech on August 28, 1963, which gave a 'mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions'. But he said there was still much to be done to honor the lives that were lost during the civil rights movement.

'They did not die in vain,' he said to the crowds gathered below. 'Their victory was great. But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete.

The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.'

He added that economic inequality - in which black unemployment is nearly twice that of white unemployment - and a country where many citizens still struggle to afford healthcare 'remains our great unfinished business'.

'When we turn not from each other or on each other but towards one another and we find we do not walk alone - that's where courage comes from,' he said. 'And with that courage we can stand together for good jobs and just wages... for the right to healthcare... for the right of every child to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit and prepares them for the world that awaits them.

'America, I know the road will be long but I know we can get there. We will stumble but I know we'll get back up.'

Throughout his speech he mentioned how the nation improved 'because they marched' in 1963, and at the end of his speech he urged people to 'keep marching.'

'No one can match King's brilliance, but the same flame that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains,' he said.

'That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge, she's marching.

'That successful businessman who doesn't have to but pays his workers a fair wage and offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con, who's down on his luck, he's marching.

'The mother who pours her love into her daughter so she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybody's son, she's marching.

Movie stars: Actors Jamie Foxx, pictured, TV star Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker alsoi spoke to the enormous crowd

'The father who realizes the most important job he'll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father, especially if he didn't have a father at home, he's marching.

'The battle scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again but to keep serving their country when they come home, they are marching.

'Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day, that change does not come from Washington but to Washington. The change has always been built on our willingness. We, the people, to take on the mantle of citizenship, you are marching.'

Obama previously said that half a century after the march was a good time to reflect on how far the country has to go, particularly after the Trayvon Martin shooting trial in Florida. The devastated parents and brother of the slain teen also attended the D.C. event on Wednesday.

Although more than 20,000 people are believed to have attended the event, more than 100,000 were expected. The number far dwarfs the 250,000 to one million that took part in the original March on Washington; 200,000 of these then witnessed the 'I Have a Dream' speech.
