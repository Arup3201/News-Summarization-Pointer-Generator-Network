The family of missing toddler William Tyrell have endured a heart-rending Christmas, with a stockpile of unopened presents from locals serving as a sombre reminder of his disappearance.

Members of the Kendall Services and Citizens Club in NSW gave a collection of gifts and Spiderman merchandise to his parents in the hope that the three-year-old will soon be found.

One of the senior officers in the investigation has said the family remain heartbroken at William's baffling disappearance almost four months ago.

After news that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation, an expansive search of the surrounding areas has led them to believe that the boy did not wander away on his own accord, reports The Sunday Telegraph - with one neighbour suggesting he could have been kidnapped.

'They indicated to me that Christmas was just a quiet silent time at home, the emptiness of having a void in their house,' lead investigator Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie Local Area Command, told The Sunday Telegraph.

'That's been unopened presents, not able to share the festivities, to see a smile on young William's face to receive gifts or presents like any other normal child.'  

Supt Fehon said a lack of evidence to support the potential scenarios has left investigators baffled.

'It's got to be either adventure that's turned into misadventure, or human intervention. Because we're not finding anything on that side, we've got to be open to the possibility of human intervention,' he said. 

His parents have also made a poignant announcement: 'We pray that 2015 brings William home.'

Supt Fehon said police were considering the importance of a walking track which starts at the end of Benaroon Drive where William disappeared and leads into the nearby Kendall cemetery.

For the first time he has also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance.

His grandmother, mother and four-year-old sister were enjoying a relaxing morning on the driveway of his grandmother's property.  

Dressed in his favourite superhero costume, William was playing a game of hide-and-seek with his sister.

He was dashing around the side of the house before reappearing with a smile and returning to his his family.  

When he ran around out of view at about 10.25am on September 12, his mother did not check on him until 10.30am, when she went around the corner looking for him and he was nowhere to be seen.

Neighbours watched the family frantically scouring the area and calling out his name, before they contacted police shortly afterwards. 

It comes after news that homicide detectives have joined the investigation into William's disappearance.

One neighbour saw William’s distraught mother pacing the quite street after William went missing.

Afterwards, his father, who had been at the shops, returned and instantly joined into the search.

The family had visited Kendall before, with locals recalling seeing them the previous December.

Another neighbour said the community has been rocked by William’s disappearance, with children no longer allowed to ride their bikes or visit the local store without supervision.

In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. 

Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that the investigation had taken a new direction.  

'We want to do a thorough investigation to determine what's happened to William and obviously we need to consider the worst case scenario,' Supt Willing said. 

A NSW police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation.  

'The homicide squad are involved to ensure thorough investigation but we have no evidence to suggest any particular scenario at this stage,' a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall that day when the little boy disappeared at Benaroon Drive about 10.30am, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister.   

Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and were concentrating their investigation on the theory that William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'.

A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. 

One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared. 

William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said.

'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.'
