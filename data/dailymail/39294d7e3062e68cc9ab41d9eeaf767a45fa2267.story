They may look like the spindly mechanical robots from War of the Worlds, but these sculptures are much less menacing.

The conceptual structures are designed as a way of ‘reclaiming’ Beirut’s shoreline for locals who could use them to harvest electricity and as ‘look outs’.

Designed to look like an eye, the ‘Iris’ sculptures would open and shut like an eye to provide shelter and would be connected to a buoy in the sea to harvest electricity, if they are ever built.

In the mock-up images, a view of the sea is framed by a pair of metal and wooden eyelids that open and close with the motion of the waves. In this way, the sculpture would blink with the rhythm of the sea.

The concepts were designed by Najjar & Najjar Architects, which has an office in the Lebanese capital.

The architects said that the sculptures connect ‘the dense city and the open sea’ and that ‘waves transform the kinematic structure into an experience of place and to harvest energy for the fishermen community’.

Separated at birth? The three-legged spindly sculptures look a little similar to the martians in H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds (pictured), which was most recently the subject of a film starring Tom Cruise in 2005

An offshore buoy with an electric generator attached via an ‘extended antenna’ would play a role in allowing the sculptures to harvest tidal power, but it is not known how much electricity the structures could generate.

The Ras Beirut district, which could one day house the unusual sculptures, has become increasingly built up with luxury developments.

‘Iris is an attempt at resisting the expropriation of Beirut's open coastline returning the sea back to the fishermen and the local habitants of the Ras Beirut district,’ they told Dezeen.

It is envisaged that the three-legged moving structures would become a chain of elevated lookouts for fishermen or anyone who wants to look out to sea.

Models of a 5:1 scale have already been tested on the desirable coastline to allow the architects to create realistic images of how the sculptures might look one day.

The architects said: ‘The principal aim of Iris is to reclaim accessibility to the sea. For centuries, the local population of Ain Mreisseh and Manara lived in tune with their costal environment, but over the past decade the shoreline has become a playground for high-end residential developments that aim to turn a maximum profit by selling off unobstructed views to the sea.

‘The dweller can experience the place, the passage of time and its natural forces.’

They would be attached to a buoy with a tethered generator to provide power for local homes - although how effective they might be is a mystery
