Missing teenager Esme Smith has been found safe and well after a member of the public recognised her from media reports about her disappearance.

The 14-year-old from Farnham, Surrey was spotted in North London by a passer-by who flagged down a nearby patrol car and alerted officers, according to Surrey Police.

Esme was last seen 11 days ago when she left school with friends, telling them that she was travelling to nearby Woking and would then go on to a party.

Found: Esme Smith, 14, has been discovered in London after going missing from her home in Surrey

Instead she went to Aldershot railway station and caught a train to London's Waterloo station, where she was caught on CCTV.

Her worried family issued an appeal for information, saying they feared she might be in danger.

The daughter of a Nato commander was yesterday found in North London and has now been returned to Surrey, according to a Surrey Police spokesman.

It is unclear whether or not she was with anyone else when she was seen by a passer-by, although she was alone when she was escorted to a North London police station yesterday.

Officials in Surrey were due today to interview her about her whereabouts for the past 11 days and determine whether or not she has been the victim of a crime.

CCTV images of the teenager at Waterloo show she had changed out of her school uniform and into a white flowery dress. She was also wearing a blue denim jacket and was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps.

The police spokesman said: 'A call was made to Surrey Police by the Metropolitan Police around 9.40am today to say that the 14-year-old, who went missing on September 12, was at a north London police station.

'Her safe return is thought to be as a direct result of the media appeals, and the media and public are thanked for their assistance.'

There was no answer at the Smiths' family home today, but a neighbour revealed that locals were delighted by the news that Esme had been found.

'It's wonderful news that she has turned up,' the man said. 'I have to admit we were all worried, so this is a massive relief to finally have some good news.'

A tall, black man driving a BMW, who was believed to be a social worker, turned up at the family home yesterday afternoon and left half an hour later carrying a small suitcase.

Her 19-year-old sister Sian last week
made an emotional appeal to the missing girl, saying: ‘Esme, if you are
reading this, I just want to say please come home or at least get in 
touch so that we know that you are safe.

‘We
are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are 
OK. You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’

More than 4,000 people had 'liked' a Facebook page called Find Esme Smith, dedicated to raising awareness of the girl's disappearance.

Her
father Mark Smith, who works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in 
Stavanger, said he was 'worried sick' about his teenage 
daughter.

Mr Smith has been decorated for service in Afghanistan, the Gulf War and Northern Ireland and he has been commander of medical planning at the Norwegian base since March last year.

Esme
is a pupil at All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham, where she was 
last seen by friends at the end of the school day on September 12.

Detective Superintendent Jon Savell thanked the public and the media for their assistance in helping to find Esme.

The head of public protection for Surrey Police said: 'Throughout our search for Esme, we were very fortunate to have the support of the local community, Esme's school, her friends, the public and the media, and it was as a direct result of the media activity that she was found.

'We have seen huge use of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, throughout our search and this has been really beneficial but we would now ask that these pages are taken down. This has been a very distressing time for Esme and her family and we would ask that that their privacy is respected.'

Mr Savell said that establishing what happened to Esme was a priority.

He said: 'It is unclear what has happened and where she has been, and establishing that is obviously a priority for us, as is ensuring her health and welfare, and continuing to support her family.'
