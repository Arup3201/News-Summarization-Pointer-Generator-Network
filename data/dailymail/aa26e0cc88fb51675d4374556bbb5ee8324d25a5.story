The years of upheaval following Egypt's revolution has had a direct impact on tourism revenues.

With westerners more cautious about visiting the country due to travel warnings and social unrest, it has meant the likes of the Great Pyramids and Tutankhamun's Tomb have seen a reduced footfall.

The Egyptian government estimate that revenues have fallen by 95 per cent since the revolution, from £250 million in 2010 to just £10.5 million for 2014.

Although tourism has picked up in the Red Sea resorts, Cairo, Luxor and Aswan are still struggling to attract an income from visitors.

This is leaving the antiquities ministry in a difficult predicament, with job losses a distinct possibility.

Speaking to The Guardian, the editor of the Luxor Times, Mena Melad, said:  'It's dead. It's even worse than in 1997 after the massacre of the tourists' at the Hatshepsut temple in the Valley of the Kings.

'There are lots of people who have given up working in tourism and are trying to find new work.'

The financial problems the country is going through was reflected in the July budget, when, with the aim to reducing the deficit by 10 per cent, new austerity measures were brought in.

The focus of the reforms were aimed at galvanising the Egyptian people to support the government and give them time to turn around the country's crippling debts.

However, with so many historical sites, the focus might well turn to how to attract foreigners to the country and give back a much-needed economic boom to the Middle Eastern country.
