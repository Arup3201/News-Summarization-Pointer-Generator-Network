Actress Amy Schumer has brushed off the negative comments made by a film critic, who deemed her too unattractive and unconventional to star in a romantic comedy, saying that she ‘could not care less’ about his rude remarks.  

Following last Wednesday's release of the trailer for her upcoming film Trainwreck, Hollywood Elsewhere writer Jeffrey Wells commented on the 33-year-old actress's looks and weight, calling her 'chubby' and noting that her 'wide facial features' remind him of a 'blonde Lou Costello'.

'She’s obviously sharp and clever and funny as far as the woe-is-me, self-deprecating thing goes, but there’s no way she’d be an object of heated romantic interest in the real world,' he wrote.

One man's opinion: Film critic Jeffrey Wells said Trainwreck star Amy Schumer (pictured with her co-star Bill Hader) would never be an 'object of heated romantic interest’

Take that: After the entertainment writer called her 'chubby', the 33-year-old comedienne responded by sharing this photo of her nearly nude body on Twitter 

The following day, Amy responded by tweeting a photo of herself wearing only underwear with her arms strategically covering her bare chest. 

'I am a size [six] and have no plans of changing. This is it. Stay on or get off. Kisses!' she captioned the snapshot. 

The tweet has since been favorited over 7,000 times, with one male Twitter user commenting: 'Please don't feel the need to be even a tiny bit defensive because of a few idiots. Trailer looks great!'

Haters gonna hate: Amy has a toast with her Trainwreck co-star Brie Larson in this still from the movie. The Judd Apatow-directed film was written by Amy and loosely based on her life

Role model: Amy flaunted her figure in a body-hugging black dress at the GQ and LeBron James Celebrate All-Star Style party held in New York City on February 14 - just days after Mr Wells slammed her appearance 

Amy told USA Today she was not fazed by the writer's comments because she didn't even read them.

'I didn’t read the thing… It was such an example of sort of the reason for trolling,' she said. 'It seems like a rewarding experience for people who do that stuff. From the bottom of my heart - I could not care less.'

Trainwreck, which was directed by Judd Apatow, was written by Amy and is loosely based on her life.

Amy stars as a single journalist who works for a men's magazine and prefers one-night stands to committed relationships - until she falls for the sports surgeon she is interviewing for a story.

Former Saturday Night Live star Bill Hader plays the role of her love interest in the film, which also stars Tilda Swinton, Vanessa Bayer, Colin Quinn and Brie Larson. Trainwreck is slated to hit theaters on July 17.
