Andrew Davies, head of the high-flying Beechen Cliff secondary school in Bath, asked parents to make monthly donations

A high-flying state school head who wrote to parents asking them to make voluntary contributions of up to £30 a month has said sorry after being accused of pressurising struggling families.

Andrew Davies said opportunities at Beechen Cliff School in Bath were similar to some private schools charging fees of up to £10,000 a year, but said the school's efforts to improve were hampered by a lack of government funds.

So he asked all parents to make voluntary contributions of £10, £20 or £30 a month, by standing order, which he said was not 'a great sum to contribute towards a child’s education'.

The head, who has been in the post since 2005, then had to apologise after parents said they already paid for the boys' school through taxes and criticised him for  'undermining the state school system'.

The school has been running a voluntary contribution scheme for 10 years and already receives around £20,000 a year as a result from some parents of the 830 boys at the school, but Mr Davies' letter was an attempt to encourage more to take part.

Mr Davies has since apologised for the ‘unhelpful’ wording of the letter, which he sent earlier this month.

In it, he wrote: 'Independent school fees are normally over £10,000 a year per pupil.

'At Beechen Cliff education is free but, if parents are willing to give a fraction of that money, we could achieve so much more.

'We are asking all families for a voluntary contribution of £30, £20 or £10 per month to the new top-up scheme.

'We believe that this isn’t a great sum to contribute towards a child’s education. 

'Of course we appreciate that some parents do not have the resources to contribute.  Thankfully there are some generous parents who are already contributing significantly.

'If you are already supporting then we are of course most grateful, but please review your contribution.'

Beechen Cliff boys' school is judged Ofsted 'outstanding' and already receives £20,000 a year in donations

Mr Davies succeeded the former head, Roy Ludlow, at the 830-boy secondary school in 2005

His suggestion was criticised by mother Jane Middleton, whose son attends Beechen Cliff, judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted.

Writing on a parents' online forum, she accused the school of 'attempting to blur the lines' between state and independent schools and of 'putting pressure on parents'.

In her post on Local Schools Network, Mrs Middleton added: 'It introduces the idea of parents contributing financially to state schools on a regular basis with the aim of it becoming the norm.

'This undermines our state school system.  It is putting financial and moral pressure on parents at a time when many are struggling.

'It ignores the fact that we already pay for state schooling through our taxes.

Mr Davies wrote a second letter to parents apologising for using 'unhelpful' wording in his letter to them

'His - and our - time would be better spent campaigning for increased state funding than supporting schemes that erode the principle of free education and lead to greater inequality.'

Mr Davies claimed that voluntary contribution schemes were widely used by schools in Bath, and said that pupils were not asked to pay for after-school clubs unless external coaches were involved.

'We have an incredible range of activities and we try to make sure that no one is disadvantaged by the lack of money,' he added.

Last month parents of children at Prince Henry's Grammar School in Otley complained after the school proposed that they would pay for each Key Stage 3 pupil to buy an iPad at a cost to parents of £360 over three years.

The school said the scheme would boost pupil attainment levels but parents questioned the merits of the scheme and the cost.

State schools asking parents for voluntary contributions for the benefit of school or school activities is increasingly common.

Some schools ask for donations in the form of monthly standing orders, as at Beechen Cliff, while others appeal for parental help when they need to fund a 
specific purchase, for example a new sports pitch.

The Department for Education guidance says there is nothing in schools legislation to prevent a school governing body or local authority from asking for voluntary contributions.

However schools may not ask parents to set up a direct debit, and parents must not be made to feel pressurised into paying.

The guidance also states that if the activity the funds are being raised for cannot be funded without voluntary contributions, the governing body or head teacher should make this clear to parents at the outset.

The governing body or head teacher must also make it clear to parents that there is no obligation to make any contribution.
