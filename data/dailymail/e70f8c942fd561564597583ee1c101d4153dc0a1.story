Today show host Karl Stefanovic has been forced to eat a spicy curry as punishment after his '7-Eleven' sledge against a group of Indian cricket fans caused viewer backlash.

Stefanovic was hit with a barrage of criticism when he asked a group of Indian fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday 'who's going to be manning 7-Elevens today?'.

The fan hilariously hit back saying 'you might have to look at Centrelink as well I think Karl' in terms of Australians at the World Cup match.

The Channel Nine host offered a light-hearted apology on Friday morning before his co-hosts brought out an extremely hot Indian curry that left him sweating and watery-eyed.

'I love India and I love the contribution Indians make in many different vocations across this great country. Our country is richer for having you and so are our sauces,' Stefanovic said as he gave his apology.

'Firstly to those members of the Indian community - our guest yesterday gave as good as he got and that banter continued in the true spirit of the world cup. 

'After the show we had a great conversation. He owned me on air and off air. It was thought to be fun, it was fun, I enjoyed it and he enjoyed it. 

'The comments were intended to be taken in the most light-hearted possible way. For anyone of you interpreting the comments in a different way my heartfelt apologies.'

The curry left Stefanovic with watery eyes and caused him to sweat on the breakfast television set

It came after an Indian fans (right) told Stefanovic he should be concerned as Centrelink would be empty of Australians as they all watch the cricket ahead of the semi-final match

Stefanovic then also offered an apology to New Zealanders after calling them 'dole bludgers', but continued to sledge fans at various times throughout the morning ahead of the match on Sunday.

'For my Kiwi brothers and sisters... calling you dole bludgers was an awful, cheap stereotype and just not true,' he said.

'As we all know you can't get the dole here in Australia. Again, my sincere, heartfelt apologies to anyone across the ditch or in Bondi who took offence. 

'Just because you've got a cool, happening, effective government and a real attractive lot of livestock doesn't meant I should take the sheep out of you.' 

His remarks were met with sighs from the rest of his Today show host panel who said: 'This isn't going well'. 

Indian cricket fans were in full force at the Sydney cricket ground on Thursday as they took on Australia in the World Cup semi final

Today show host Karl Stefanovic made a light-hearted apology for his '7-Eleven' sledge to a group of Indian cricket fans saying Australia is 'richer for having you and so are our sauces' 

Stefanovic said the New Zealand fans had a bit to say on social media in relation to his comments and read out some of the complaints he had received. 

'Obviously we were having a bit of banter about the cricket and I made some comments about New Zealand fans and a lot of you just aren't happy,' he said.

'We received thousands of comments about New Zealand and I'm surprised you can actually write.'

The breakfast television host then read out some of the complaints sent in saying he was a 'twit' and a 'big mouthed d***head'.

The interview that sparked the whole ordeal took place on Thursday morning outside the Sydney Cricket Ground when Stefanovic was sledging a group of Indian fans ahead of the semi-final match.

The Indian fan's comeback caused an uproar of laughter in the Today Show studio, as Stefanovic said: 'What are you going to say to Warner?'

Australian cricketer Dave Warner was famously fined 50 per cent of his match fee after he told Indian batsman Rohit Sharma to 'speak English' at the MCG in January.

'Look I'm not sure we can repeat that stuff on TV this early in the morning,' the India fan smiled.

'We'll definitely be right into him that's for sure. We'll definitely be speaking in English so he understands,' the India fan said.

Viewers quickly reacted to Stefanovic's 7-Eleven question on social media, with some labelling it 'tasteless'.

Karl Stefanovic asked a team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?'

Andy Cussen asked: 'How does Karl Stefanovic still have a job? Complete muppet.'

Megan Maurice said: 'You know, you just start to think that maybe Karl Stefanovic isn't that bad after all and then...'

Angus Roberts described his comments as 'bit of a tasteless "joke"'.

And Paul Nolan said: 'I'm usually a fan of Karl Stefanovic but his 7-11 quip today was inappropriate and offensive.'

Amber Monahan went as far as to call him 'an embarrassment to thinking Australians'.

'How dare you insult contributing members of Australia's economy. You sir are a fool. And Lisa Wilkinson guffawing in the background is hardly much better,' she said.

However, Doovalacky Dave called Stefanovic's comments 'gold'.
