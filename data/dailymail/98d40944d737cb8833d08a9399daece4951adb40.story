Arsene Wenger will step up his search for holding midfielders in the wake of the defensive debacle against Monaco — but the club fear that they will be unable to prise Christoph Kramer from Bayer Leverkusen.

Arsenal identified Kramer, Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin and Lars Bender, also at Bayer Leverkusen, as transfer targets.

Germany international Kramer is top of their list — but the 24-year-old extended his deal at Leverkusen until June 2019 in December.

Arsenal are looking to try and sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Christoph Kramer

Kramer is on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach and has never actually played of Leverkusen

Curiously, Kramer has never played for Leverkusen, having been on loan at Vfl Bochum and Borussia Monchengladbach, where he played so well he was selected for Germany’s World Cup- winning squad, starting in the final.

But having been ignored by Leverkusen until now, it will be politically embarrassing for him to leave the club in a £20million deal without ever playing for the first team.

When he signed his new deal, Leverkusen announced that he would return to them next season and be a key player. Inquiries will be made as to whether the club would sell, though the new contract makes any negotiation difficult.

The 24-year-old could cost up to £20 million, and recently signed a new contract with the club until 2019

Kramer’s return to Leverkusen may, however, open the way for Arsenal to sign Bender. If Kramer returns and is not for sale, Arsenal will hope that the Bundesliga club will be willing to let Bender go and he could provide an alternative — and Arsenal might be able to sign him for around £15m. Southampton, meanwhile, would hold out for £25m for Schneiderlin.

Arsenal’s lack of world-class players in that position means that recruitment is a necessity this summer. 

Francis Coquelin is expected to sign a new four-year deal in the coming weeks but there is a recognition at the club that it will become increasingly hard for club captain Mikel Arteta to maintain his position in the starting XI when he returns from injury.

Likewise, Mathieu Flamini, who has one year left on his deal, is regarded as a squad player rather than a first-team starter.

Meanwhile Wenger has reacted to Jose Mourinho’s latest barb by implying that Arsenal, who take on Everton today, are not wholly out of the title race. 

Mourinho went on TV last week to say that Wenger had a ‘dream job’ but that he didn’t understand why the team wasn’t challenging Chelsea and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table.

Wenger said: ‘Leave Mourinho out of here, it would be much better. Let’s wait until the end of the season, we have 48 points today. We will see at the end of the season.’
