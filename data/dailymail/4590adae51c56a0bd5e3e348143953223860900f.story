About 100 people were arrested and at least 44 people were taken to the hospital during a weekend college party in Southern California that devolved into a rock- and bottle-throwing melee, authorities said.

The violence broke out in the densely populated beachside community of Isla Vista around 9:30 p.m. Saturday during the annual spring break party known as Deltopia, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office said.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Hoover said things escalated after a University of California, Santa Barbara police officer was hit in the face with a backpack filled with large bottles of alcohol.

Carnage: The Spring Break party erupted into chaos - leading to the arrest of more than 100 revelers

The officer was hospitalized with a 'significant head injury,' according to a statement from the university.

Authorities said some members of the crowd of 15,000 then began throwing rocks, bricks and bottles at officers, lighting fires and damaging law enforcement vehicles.

'It was an emergency situation where we had to call in mutual aid,' Hoover said. 'They have had civil disturbances before in Isla Vista, but it has been many years since something like this.'

Authorities reported using tear gas, pepper spray and foam projectiles to disperse the surging crowd.

Fights: More than 100 people were arrested when an annual spring break party in California turned violent, with police using chemical spray and foam bullets to disperse crowds

Chaos: More than 40 people, including several law enforcement officers, were taken to hospitals for treatment after clashes broke out between partygoers and police during the annual "Deltopia" street party in Isla Vista

Public disorder: The melee erupted Saturday evening after a university police officer was hit in the head with a backpack filled with large bottles of liquor, the sheriff's office said in a statement

Commotion: Authorities tried to break up the event by declaring an unlawful assembly, and 'chemical agents and less lethal foam projectiles were deployed to disperse the crowds,' the statement said

At least five more officers were injured in the melee, including one officer who was hit in the face with a brick and two others who were both hit in the hand with bottles, sheriff's deputies said.

All had been released from the hospital by Sunday morning, Hoover said.

Earlier in the day, authorities also responded to reports of a stabbing and found several individuals carrying weapons, she said.

Aside from those who were treated after the brawl broke out, nearly every person who was hospitalized on Saturday had consumed excess alcohol, Hoover added.  

Unruly: At least five other sheriff's deputies were injured, including one who was hit in the face with a brick and two who were hit with bottles

Destruction: There was no immediate word on how many of the 100 arrested would be charged with crimes

Crowd control: Approximately 18 people were arrested during the actual disturbance, police said

Party over: The incident unfolded about 9:30 p.m. at the event, known as Deltopia, which drew about 15,000 revelers

Anti-social: Some vandalized street signs, set small fires, and damaged property, including law enforcement vehicles, police said

'It really was ridiculous,' Hoover said. 'Deltopia attracts out-of-towners who come in and are not invested in our community and there are some who come to cause trouble.'

The situation had stabilized by Sunday morning after sheriffs received backup support from multiple agencies in neighboring Ventura County.

Isla Vista borders the university and is known for partying. The half-mile area has roughly 23,000 residents, of which 60 percent are students.

Hoover said authorities remained in the area Sunday morning cleaning up broken glass and trash strewn throughout the neighborhood.
