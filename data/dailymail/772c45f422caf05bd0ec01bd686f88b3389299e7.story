Treacherous winter storms and heavy snow in the US have caused unusually cold weather, traffic chaos and school closures for over a month.

But despite arctic conditions experts are claiming that this winter was the 19th warmest since records began - and in five states it was the warmest.

Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Washington all beat previous records, according to the National Climatic Data Center.

A snowman stands in front of the Dallas skyline. Heavy snow in the US has caused unusually cold weather, traffic chaos and school closures for over a month - but experts are saying it was the 19th warmest winter on record

They weren't affected by below-average February temperatures due to a mild first half of winter, experts said.

The average temperature across the US for winter was 34.3 degrees - more than two degrees higher than normal, Market Watch reported. 

And the total precipitation was just 6.12 inches - nearly one inch below average. 

The comments come after weeks of heavy snowfall and traffic chaos - dubbed the 'Siberian Express' - hit the country.

But the snow is  retreating rapidly, with more than half the area covered this time a week ago now bare.

According to forecasts, the warmth is set to remain for at least the next few days, melting much of the snow across the northern parts of the country.

On March 1, 63.4 per cent of the contiguous US was covered in snow, while by March 8 the figure was 30.1 per cent, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Warmer temperatures are due to remain at least as long as Tuesday, which will see some central areas of the US soar to 25 degrees above their regular mid-March average.

Alex Sosnowski, a senior meteorologist, said: 'A change in the weather pattern will turn off arctic air invasions to allow the March sun to go to work over much of the central and northeastern United States'.
