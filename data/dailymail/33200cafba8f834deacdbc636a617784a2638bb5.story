Wavering Scottish voters were told last night that work towards a ‘Home Rule Bill’ would begin the day after next week’s referendum if they back a No vote.

In a desperate bid to halt the momentum of the campaign for independence, Gordon Brown announced a rapid timetable to give the Scottish parliament greater control over finance, welfare and taxation.

Such a bill, which could give Scots the power to raise income tax to pay for more spending, will be outlined within six weeks of the vote.

With the backing of Labour supporters in Scotland vital, the former prime minister appeared to have elbowed aside his former chancellor Alistair Darling, head of the cross-party Better Together campaign, to seize effective command of the battle to save the Union.

Incredibly, the move leaves the fate of David Cameron – likely to face calls to quit if he presides over the end of the 300-year-old Union – depending on the success or failure of Mr Brown, his opponent at the 2010 general election.

Throughout the campaign, polls have shown that if given the choice more Scots would pick the option of a stronger Scottish parliament over independence or the current arrangement.

But Mr Cameron favoured a straight Yes/No choice on independence, rather than putting a ‘devo-max’ option on the referendum ballot paper. Downing Street last night welcomed Mr Brown’s timetable and all three Westminster parties are expected to formally back the proposals this week.

But, despite his attempt to present the plans as something that has already been decided, there are deep splits in Labour over whether or not to enhance its existing offer to hand more powers to Scotland.

At a miners’ welfare club in Loanhead, Midlothian, Mr Brown said: ‘The alternative to an irreversible separation is a more powerful Scottish parliament with a timetable for its delivery.

‘Scottish voters deserve to know to the fullest extent possible about how new powers as ambitious as possible will be delivered as soon as possible within the UK. So, we are demanding a tight timetable with tough deadlines and streamlined procedures.

‘A No vote on September 18 will not be an end point but the starting gun for action on September 19, when straight away we will kick off a plan to deliver the enhanced devolution that we want. On September 19 we will start bringing into law the new, stronger Scottish parliament, and to secure the change we want we will work with the other parties.’

Mr Brown said a document outlining the plans and issues that need to be resolved would be published by the end of October, with a White Paper drawn up by November 30, St Andrew’s Day.

Yesterday, Mr Brown hit the No campaign trail on the streets of his hometown in Kirkcaldy in Fife to talk to local residents 

Draft legislation for a new Scotland Act would then be drawn up by Burns Night on January 25.

Mr Brown said the proposed new powers including the ability to change income tax ‘would be the biggest transfer of fiscal power in the history of the UK’.

He added: ‘My judgment is that these are the powers people want. A stronger Scottish parliament within the UK, without breaking the link on pensions, funding, health care, jobs, the currency and defence.’

The three Westminster parties have each put forward separate plans for devolving more powers, but a Downing Street source said they overlap to a substantial degree.

The Scottish Conservatives want Holyrood to be given full income tax powers and responsibility on welfare issues related to devolved areas, such as housing benefits. In its proposals, Scottish Labour’s devolution commission said the Scottish parliament should be able to vary tax by up to 15p in the pound, giving it the option of restoring the 50p rate for top earners. The Liberal Democrats want Scotland to be able to raise and spend most of its own taxes and borrow on its own terms.

The Yes campaign said Mr Brown’s last-ditch intervention ‘smacked of utter panic and desperation’.

Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who is a Labour Party stalwart, but has largely been absent from the Better Together campaign 

He is a Labour Party stalwart and supporter of the campaign against independence, but Sir Alex Ferguson’s absence from the effort to keep Scotland in the UK over recent months has been noticeable.

The former Manchester United manager came out in support of the Better Together campaign two years ago soon after its launch, but has not spoken out recently.

Earlier this year, David Cameron suggested that Sir Alex should be used in advertisements to boost the anti-independence cause.

The football manager’s roots in the shipbuilding community of Glasgow could help win over Scots from the most deprived areas, who polls suggest are open to voting ‘yes’.

Sir Alex previously criticised Alex Salmond for trying to ‘silence’ Scots living outside Scotland over independence. ‘No one should question my Scottishness just because I live south of the border,’ he said.
