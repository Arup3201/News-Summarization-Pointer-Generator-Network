A mother tried to smuggle four illegal immigrants into Britain inside a VW camper van after being told it would clear her cocaine debts.

Crystal Mosley, 27, and her partner Daniel Hassard, 25, both from Marton, near Blackpool, were told their £3,000 drug debt would be cleared if they brought four foreigners into the country.

The couple, who travelled to France pretending to look at campsites for family holidays, were caught boarding a ferry near Calais.

Crystal Mosley and Daniel Hassard admitted people smuggling charges after Border Officials found four illegal immigrants hiding in the back of their rented VW Camper van

Border Control officials searched their rented camper van and found the illegal passengers - three from Vietnam and one from China - hiding in the back.

Mosley, who was driving the vehicle, initially feigned shock telling officials: 'I didn’t know they were there.'

She later admitted taking part in the scheme, saying she and Hassard had been offered up to £3,000 for the safe delivery of the group.

Mosley and Hassard both from Marton, near Blackpool, Lancashire admitted people smuggling charges at Canterbury Crown Court.

Mosley was given 15 months - but it was suspended for two years so she could care for her nine-year-old son.

She must also abide by 7pm to 7am curfew for four months.

Canterbury Crown Court were told how the couple had amassed debts  through cocaine use and were promised up to £3,000 for bringing the group in to the UK

Painter and decorator Hassard was jailed for 15 months after claiming the operation was 'his idea.'

Details of the couple’s exploits emerged in court last Friday, where prosecutors told how the van was stopped by Border Patrol officers at Coquelles, France at 1.30am on August 22 last year.

Mosley was driving and she said they had left the UK the previous day. She claimed the couple were looking at campsites in the country.

But officers ordered the back of the van to be opened and discovered one man crouched on the floor with two more illegal immigrants hiding in a bunk bed and a fourth hiding in a corner.

Mosley initially denied knowing there were passengers in the back  but later broke down and confessed - claiming she and Hassard had run up debts using cocaine.

She said they owed money to dealers but both of them had lost their jobs shortly before making the trip.

Mosley said they had been offered between £2,000 and £3,000 to bring in people into the country.

She said they had been supplied with a rented camper van and given £200 to buy tickets and fuel for the journey.

Hassard told officers they had been promised £3,000. He said they planned to use some of the money to pay off debts, buy clothes and go on a holiday.

He admitted no threats had been made to them to complete the journey.

In mitigation for Hassard, defence counsel Kerry Waitt said the couple had been in a relationship for three years and Hassard was 'very much the father figure' to Mosley’s son.

She added: 'Had it not been for my client and his encouragement and inveiglement, his co-accused would not be sitting in the dock next to him.

'He takes full responsibility for her position today. He is a young man who foolishly had run up debts to people who it is not comfortable to owe money to. It was made clear in graphic detail what would happen if the money was not found.'

Christopher Wray, for Mosley, said the mother was now 'drug free' and had moved house to keep away from former friends involved in the drugs scene.

After the case David Fairclough from Home Office Criminal Investigations said: 'Those involved in people smuggling pray on the desperation of others in order to line their own pockets and are a major factor in illegal immigration to the UK.

'This case sends a strong message to those who think they can cheat the system.'

Mosley was given 15 months, suspended for two years, while Hassard was jailed for 15 months.
