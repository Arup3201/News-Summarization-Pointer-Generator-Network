It was a perfect September day; the air still with small white clouds scudding across a blue sky, the sun warm on our backs. Bees buzzed and small white butterflies fluttered around the wild flowers that lined the deep lane.

With the church spire of a peaceful village in the distance, we could have been on a Sunday walk along an ancient drovers' road.

But when we stopped, our guide sharply focused our attentions well away from thoughts of a rural idyll. He revealed that we were close to the spot on the Sunken Road where Geoffrey Malins, an official British war photographer, set up his camera to capture the most dramatic shot of his life - as the German redoubt of Hawthorn Ridge was blown sky-high early on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.

It would last until November 13, by which time the British had suffered 420,000 casualties - 60,000 on the first day alone.

Our guide, a military historian, knew his stuff and told it well. He knew when to insert an anecdote or flesh out a character, and had an engaging habit of referring to General Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force in France, as Dougie Haig.

The Sunken Road was our last stop on an absorbing four-day tour of the Western Front, that shifting barbed-wire battle line between the Allied and German armies running some 440 miles from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border.

Our group of 21, mainly middle-aged plus, included a father and his quiet, observant 14-year-old son who had a knack of finding fragments of weapons and ammunition.

We visited battlefields, cemeteries, field stations, memorial parks, a magnificent museum and a clutch of quirky cafes, once houses close to the front line, now with an assortment of war memorabilia, often including trenches in the back garden. Our trip was moving, heart-rending, often shocking, sometimes light-hearted - but never depressing.

One evening at 8pm we stood, part of a silent crowd, at the great Menin Gate of Ypres as the buglers of the local fire brigade sounded Last Post as they have done every evening, except during the Second World War, since November 11, 1929, when the tradition was established.

The words 'They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old', often spoken by a visiting dignitary, still touch the heart.

The Gate, more a magnificent arch, was built on the crossroads where British and Commonwealth troops marched east out of the town to the battlefields of the Ypres Salient. Thousands would never return. Panels of white Portland stone, chiselled with the names of 54,389 men missing in those battles, line the arch; the Hall of Memory. The silence was intense as the last bugle note died away.

Battles result in cemeteries and memorials, and there are hundreds of them, from small plots on the edge of a village to the majestic splendour of the Thiepval Memorial to the 72,000-plus British and South African men missing on the Somme and with no known grave. There is an atmosphere of tranquillity in every carefully tended cemetery, with seasonal flowers or evergreens growing in the small strip of earth in front of each white stone grave.

Some of our group had requested 'special visits' to cemeteries where relatives were buried. As my father had survived the Battle of Loos in 1915, I was curious about the site - as was another in our group, Roz Taylor, who by an extraordinary coincidence also had a father who had survived the carnage. The battle lasted 19 days and was a failure. The British used gas for the first time, some blowing back over their own troops.

Rudyard Kipling's only son fell at Loos; Robert Graves survived and wrote vividly about his experiences in his autobiography Goodbye To All That.

Roz had brought a copy of her father's war diary and showed me part of his entry for a 6am bombardment at Loos. He wrote: '...the sight of men stumbling into reddish mist [gas] then they sat down suddenly as though tying up their shoes. After a while realized with a shock they were dead.'

My father, only slightly gassed, got a bullet through his right arm and was discharged. Earlier that year, he had fought with the Royal Munster Fusiliers at the Battle of Aubers Ridge, another disaster with high casualties.

As a child, I thought his picture of a mounted priest standing on a muddy track in front of a group of weary soldiers rather gloomy. As he never talked about the war, I understood the picture's significance only after his death.

'The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois' took place on May 8, 1915, the eve of the battle of Aubers Ridge. Painted by Fortunino Matania, it caused 'a minor emotional storm' when it appeared in The Sphere magazine in November 1916. Sadly, bombs in the Second World War destroyed the original.

My copy will go to my third grandson, who, aged 13, knew more about my father's war than I did at the age of 70.

Fortunately, the Great War is now on the school curriculum and the course includes battlefield trips.

I saw a school group at the Menin Gate and another walking decorously on a conducted tour through trenches at the Vimy Ridge memorial park. Cheery participants in a 10k Sunday run streamed past us as we walked to the excellent interpretative centre in what is now a green 250-acre park - with areas of unexploded bombs safely fenced off. When the Canadians attacked Vimy Ridge in snow and sleet at 5.30am on Easter Monday, April 9, 1917, they fought on devastated war-scarred land, but took the ridge.

The guide pointed across the trenches. 'The German front line was there, close enough for the troops to shout across to each other.' One German is said to have warned: 'Hello Tommy, you better be careful. We're moving out, the Prussians are coming and they're very good shots.'

Sombre: The group visited the German cemetery at Langemarck where four brooding bronze soldiers guard their fallen comrades buried under black stone slabs without headstones

Somehow it was fitting that we visited the sombre and severe German cemetery at Langemarck early one misty grey morning. Here, four brooding bronze soldiers guard their fallen comrades buried under black stone slabs without headstones, many to a grave. There was no sense of tranquillity here and the folly and waste of war somehow seemed so much more forceful.

It was forceful, too, at the preserved battlefield of Hill 62 just south-east of Ypres. The man-made hill was built-up spoil from the adjacent 19th Century railway.

New growth has slightly softened the scars and mine craters but randomly scattered lumps of concrete and a massive ruined pillbox, a good 3ft thick and partially covered by brambles, give the place a brutal air. A vital vantage point, the hill changed hands several times during intense fighting. Ypres itself never fell into enemy hands but the bodies of many soldiers from both sides still lie below this battlefield.

The adjacent privately owned Sanctuary Wood Museum and cafe is an oldstyle tourist attraction. The remains of trenches, the heaps of shrapnel, barbed wire and rusting weapons in the garden, together with the assortment of military memorabilia in the museum - badges, scraps of letters, yellowing newspaper cuttings, caps, spiked German helmets, bayonets, posters - all touch the heart.

On the drive back to the coast, some of us wondered why, when still 80 miles from Calais, lunch was to be at seasidesounding Ocean Villas.

Blame the British Tommy, who, unfazed by foreign words, found a simple English equivalent. Ypres became 'Wipers'; Wytschaete, a much fought-over ridge village, 'White Sheet', and Auchonvillers - a village behind British lines - 'Ocean Villas'.

There was so much more to see and ponder, such as the astonishing smallness of the operating theatre, a windowless bunker, at the Essex Farm dressing station at Ypres Salient where both surgeon and patient could hear the thunder of the front line a few miles away; the plaque, also at Essex Farm, inscribed with the poem In Flanders Fields, written by Dr John McCrae after the death of his friend; the simple, moving comments in the visitors' books kept in the bronze boxes at the entrance to all Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries.

No wonder people return to the First World War battlefields. One could never tire of such a deeply layered human subject.
