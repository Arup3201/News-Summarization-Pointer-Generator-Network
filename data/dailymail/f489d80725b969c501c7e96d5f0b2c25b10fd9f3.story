A Massachusetts man who has been responsible for a staggering 10 other car wrecks is in jail on vehicular homicide and other charges in the June death of a 20-year-old jogger.

Haley Cremer had stopped to chat with a friend on the sidewalk when she was hit and killed by a speeding SUV allegedly driven by 44-year-old Jeffrey Bickoff.

Bickoff was arraigned in Stoughton District Court Wednesday for the June 4 death of Haley Cremer, a student at Simmons College in Sharon, about 20 miles south of Boston.

At the arraignment, Assistant District Attorney Debi Curley described how Bickoff's speeding Ford Explorer drove across a lane marker near the intersection of Hampton and Dogwood roads in Sharon and then 'struck and catapulted Haley 78 feet to her death' as she had stopped jogging to talk with a friend.

Tragic: 20-year-old Haley Cremer was struck by an SUV allegedly driven by 44-year-old Jeffrey Bickoff

Excited: Cremer was a good student who just finished her sophomore year of college and was looking forward to starting her summer job at Lululemon

Responsible: Jeffrey Bickoff has been responsible for at least 10 vehicle collisions prior to allegedly hitting Cremer

Curley also says that Bickoff had consumed three liquor drinks before getting behind the wheel and that he should have been able to see Cremer before he hit her from a distance that is nearly the length of a football field.

'He drives between 45 and 50 miles an hour, claiming he wasn’t texting, 
claiming he didn’t drop a cigarette, claiming that he wasn’t distracted,
 yet we know that for 290 feet the defendant had visibility,' Curley 
said, the Boston Globe reports.

'Yet he drove over the right fog lane onto a raised curb and 
struck and catapulted Haley some 78 feet to her death — although he lost
 the privilege of driving when his license was suspended,' she continued.

In addition to the vehicular homicide, Bickoff also is charged with speeding, driving with a suspended license, and committing a marked lane violation.

In addition to the 10 previous accidents, Bickoff also has nine speeding tickets on his driving record, the Globe reports.

Bail: Bickoff's attorney says he is indigent and can't afford the $10,000 bail a judge is requiring to free him from custody as he awaits trial

Responsibility: Bickoff's attorney says his client is cooperating with police and that he feels horrible about what happened

Visibility: Prosecutors say Bickoff should have been able to see Cremer from 290 feet away before he allegedly hit her at this intersection

Judge Richard D. Savignano set Bickoff's bail at $10,000 cash and set a pretrial hearing for August 8.

The paper reports that Bickoff's attorney says his client is indigent and it is unlikely he will be able to afford to bail himself out of jail.

'He took full responsibility and is just devastated by the whole situation,' Bickoff's court appointed attorney, Richard Comenzo told the paper. 

Cremer had just moved into an apartment in Sharon. Her uncle she was a good student and was excited about her summer job at Lululemon.

'This is a young woman who was undoubtedly going to make a remarkable 
wife, a remarkable mother, and to have that taken away in such a 
senseless, stupid loss, it shakes the boundaries of my faith,' her 
uncle, Steve Litner, told the paper. 'I cannot make sense of it.'
