American Pit Bull Terriers were created as fighting dogs by crossbreeding bulldogs, mastiffs and terriers. They are descendants of English dogs used to bait bulls and bears for cruel pit fights.

They continue to be used for illegal dog fighting in the US and In the UK  are considered so dangerous it is illegal to own one.

However Dark Dynasty K9s insist their animals have calm, well balanced temperaments and would be suitable as family pets.
