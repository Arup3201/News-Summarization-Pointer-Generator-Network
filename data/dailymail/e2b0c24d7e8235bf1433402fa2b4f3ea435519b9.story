Paul Gambaccini said he went through 12 months of trauma when he was put on police bail over allegations of historic sexual offences 

Veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini yesterday backed the Home Secretary’s plan to limit the time suspects can be kept on police bail without charge.

The 65-year-old broadcaster, who spent a year on bail before being told last week he would not be prosecuted over historic sex abuse allegations, said he welcomed Theresa May’s proposals with ‘enthusiasm’.

Concern over the issue has grown after a number of high-profile cases in which people were left in limbo for long periods before learning that they would not face trial.

Scotland Yard was criticised after Gambaccini and entertainers Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr were left on bail for months over sex allegations in the Operation Yewtree investigation set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal. None were prosecuted.

Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, 74, spent 11 months on police bail before being told this year that he would not be charged over sex abuse claims investigated by North Yorkshire Police. 

Elsewhere, dozens of journalists have been repeatedly bailed as police investigate allegations of phone hacking and bribery.

Mrs May told chief constables yesterday that the Government would look at introducing a statutory limit on how long suspects could be kept on ‘pre-charge bail’.

Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has announced a consultation into the way police bail is used to prevent suspects having to wait for months or years to learn if they will be charged

Gambaccini, who was cleared last week after what he called ‘12 months of horror and trauma’, said: ‘I hope it leads to change that will prevent future injustices. If my ordeal can help prevent other persons from a similar fate, it will have been worthwhile.’ 

Figures compiled by BBC Radio 5 Live from 40 police forces show 71,526 suspects are on bail – 5,480 of them for more than six months.

The force average is 1,788 suspects bailed, compared with 1,689 last year. 

Speaking at the annual conference of the College of Policing, which sets police standards, Mrs May said she was pleased senior officers were ‘developing evidence-based guidance to bring consistency, transparency and rigour to the way pre-charge bail is used in criminal investigations’.

The Home Secretary added: ‘But in parallel we must also look at statutory time limits on the use of pre-charge bail to prevent people spending months or even years on bail only for no charges to be brought.’ 

Law Society president Andrew Caplen said there should be a limit of 28 days to stop people being left ‘in the wilderness’ as police decided whether to charge them. 

He said: ‘Not only does keeping someone on police bail interfere with their liberty, it means police investigations can be slow, making the justice system less efficient and with a negative effect on complainants and witnesses.’

John Harding, of legal firm Kingsley Napley, said: ‘This affects thousands of non-celebrities every day, often with devastating impact.’

College of Policing boss Chief Constable Alex Marshall said police bail was ‘an important tool’, but added: ‘There are concerns about variations in the time people remain on bail.’
