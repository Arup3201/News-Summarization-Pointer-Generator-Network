Mike Weatherley was targeted after he urged David Cameron to take action against Russia's anti-gay laws

A Conservative MP has received a death threat on Twitter after he appealed to David Cameron to speak out against Russia’s anti-gay legislation.

Mike Weatherley, the MP for Hove and Portslade, East Sussex, wrote to Mr Cameron to say that Britain 'has a duty not to stay silent' over anti-gay laws passed in the lead up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

He received the message: 'Kill Weatherley' from a twitter user with almost 1,500 followers.

Mr Weatherley said: 'Twitter trolls cannot be allowed to hide behind their computers when making threats like this.

'There is absolutely no way that I 
will allow this intimidating kind of behaviour to change my stance on 
this matter, as I will continue to stand up for gay rights both in 
Russia and around the world.'

The MP’s office said the tweet has now been reported to Sussex Police, who are investigating the source of the message.

The controversy in Russia was sparked after politicians in its lower house of parliament, the Duma, passed a law imposing heavy fines for providing information about homosexuality to people under 18.

It led to broadcaster Stephen Fry writing an open letter urging Mr Cameron to support moves to strip Russia of the Winter Olympics.

The threat against Mr Weatherley also comes after Twitter UK general manager Tony Wang posted a series of tweets recently saying abuse was 'simply not acceptable' on the site.

His messages came after the website clarified its rules on abusive behaviour amid a growing backlash over a series of attacks, including against a number of high-profile women.

These have included television classicist Mary Beard, Labour MP Stella Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez.
