Draped in Malaysian flags and carried by soldiers, the bodies of three of the MH17 victims, including the doomed plane's chief steward, were brought back to Kuala Lumpur this morning.

Malaysia Airlines crew members, dressed smartly in their uniforms, wept as the coffin containing the remains of Mohd Ghafar Abu Bakar, 54, was unloaded and carried to a waiting hearse by nine soldiers.

An urn containing the ashes of Universiti Malaysia Sabah lecturer Ng Shi Ing, 32, also arrived in Malaysia today, along with the body of a third victim - who has not been identified following a request by family members.

 All three were given full military honours for the repatriation ceremony, as were the 20 passengers and crew members brought back two days ago.

Airline pilots and cabin crew joined family members for a minute's silence in honour of the three victims, before the hearses were driven past the assembled crown en route to their final resting places.

Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai also attended the solemn procession after the bodies were flown home on a commerical jet from Amsterdam, arriving at around 6.30am, local time.

Mr Bakar's coffin was then taken to Ampang for burial, while Ms Ng's ashes were taken to the Xiao En Bereavement Centre in Cheras. 

The body of Ms Ng's sister Elisabeth Ng Lyeti, 33, was brought back on Friday, and the ashes of both sisters will kept at the centre until the remains of the English language lecturer's one-year-old baby son Benjamin Lee Jian Han can be repatriated.

The sisters had been planning their trip to Belgium, where Ms Ng attended a research conference for almost a year, while her husband, Lieutenant Commander Lee Vee Weng - who carried his wife's flag-draped urn into the centre this morning - stayed in Malaysia due to his work commitments with the Royal Malaysian Navy.

All 298 people onboard flight MH17 died when the jet was shot down over an area of Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. 

The victims included 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals. An international investigation is ongoing, but no one has been arrested.

The return of the bodies  has represented a political triumph for Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose already shaky popularity ratings were hit by his handling of the still unsolved disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its 239 passengers and crew in March. 

Najib has claimed personal credit for negotiating a deal with pro-Russian separatists for the return of all the bodies. Few details have been released over what the separatists were given in return, and some critics have said that the negotiations with people many regard as terrorists set a dangerous precedent.
