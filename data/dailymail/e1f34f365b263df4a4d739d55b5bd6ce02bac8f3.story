X Factor winner Sam Bailey had been secretly mentored by PR guru Max Clifford for years before entering the singing competition, it has emerged.

The 36-year-old, who snared a £1million record deal through the show, even performed at the consultant's 70th birthday celebrations after he discovered her in a Cotwolds pub.

Clifford, who is due to stand trial for sex offence charges next year, 'opened doors' for the former prisoner officer who had previously been rejected by the X Factor in 2007.

The former prison officer was a firm favourite to win the competition throughout the live shows

He reportedly told his friend and the show's producer Simon Cowell he 'simply had to hear her sing', and to allow her to audition.

The 70-year-old refused to talk of his hand in making Bailey's career a success, but admitted: 'Sam's voice bowled me over.

'All I 
did for her was to open a few doors and talk to several influential 
people.

'The rest was up to her - and now she's big-time. But her success
 is all really down to her and her alone.' 

But sources close to the publicist suggested he convinced Simon Cowell to hear her out, and allow her one more shot at fame.

The 36-year-old singer was allegedly discovered by the PR guru two years before entering this year's competition

The singer not only scooped a £1million recording contract through the show but was named Christmas Number One with her debut single Skyscraper

'As a result the music guru and his 
fellow executives were amazed by her voice and Sam went from 
strength-to-strength through the televised rounds of public votes.

'Not only did she win the X-Factor show 
by being crowned peoples' favourite, she also notched up the top selling
 Christmas No1 with her disc Skyscraper,' added the source.

A spokesman for the Syco Entertainment dismissed claims the publicist had influenced music mogul Cowell, and that he never knew the pair had met.

'Sam Bailey was an emphatic winner of the X Factor this year with more than a million votes from the public in the final alone.

'To suggest any inappropriateness would be untrue and, frankly, ridiculous.' 

However sources close to Max Clifford said: 'Nothing of Max's involvement in the years leading up to Sam's fame could have been publicised beforehand because people would have argued Sam she had an unfair advantage.

'His involvement needed to remain under wraps - in fact, Max's role in talking to Simon about her talents, was one of the show's best kept secrets.'

Bailey is thought to have performed at Clifford's birthday party as well as at a string of charity events hosted organised by the guru in the south-east.

The singer from Leicester was praised and admired by fans for her down-to-earth and honest demeanor throughout the show.

Her
 girl-next-door image could be damaged by the news which suggests she 
had some help honing a a public persona before entering the 
competition.

The singer's representatives have not responded to Mail Online's request for comment.

Clifford is due to appear in court in March to face charges of indecent assault after being arrested by police working on Operation Yewtree.

The 70-year-old pleaded not guilty to 11 sexual offence charges in October and will stand trial in the new year.
