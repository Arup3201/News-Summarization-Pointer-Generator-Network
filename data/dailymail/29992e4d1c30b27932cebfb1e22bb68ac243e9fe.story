A supporter of Barack Obama has admitted he tried to hide a video of the President speaking out in favour of a controversial Harvard professor while he was a student.

Conservative rabble-rouser Andrew Breitbart had promised to release the 'explosive' video, which shows Mr Obama embracing outspoken academic Derrick Bell, just weeks before his sudden death last Thursday.

A website unearthed the video earlier today, but it initially seemed much less dramatic than one might have expected given Mr Breitbart's boasts.

However, Charles Ogletree, a Harvard professor and ally of the President, clearly thought otherwise.

In footage filmed last year and revealed on Fox News tonight by the editors of Mr Breitbart's website, Mr Ogletree is seen showing the video of Mr Obama and Mr Bell to an audience of students.

After it was completed, Mr Ogletree said: 'Of course, we hid this during the 2008 election... I don't care if they find it now.'

Hot topic: The rally was in support of Mr Bell, who was upset that a female black professor was not tenured by the university

No matter political persuasion, it is hard to dispute that Derrick Bell was a pioneer in the legal field, but controversy followed him from school to school.

After working at the University of Southern California, he used the protests of students at Harvard Law School to leverage himself to get a faculty position there.

He then left to take over the dean position at the University of Oregon School of Law, which made him one of the first black deans of a non-black school, if not the first.

The diversity of the faculty at the University of Oregon became a cause dear to his heart and that passion continued throughout his career.

He left Oregon in amid a row over faculty diversity, and then, as seen in the video featuring Mr Obama, he spearheaded the cause when he returned the the hallowed-grounds of Harvard.

He staged multiple sit-ins during his time there in an effort to get more female professors on staff. When it came to the question of Regina Austin in 1991, he even took a leave of absence from the school in protest and went on to do a hunger strike.

Mr Bell, pictured below, died in October of last year from carcinoid cancer.

This afternoon, Buzzfeed posted a video 
of Mr Obama speaking at a protest in support of Mr Bell's 
fight for a more diverse faculty while he was a student at Harvard Law 
School.

The video, which runs just over a 
minute, was shot in 1991 when Mr Obama was 30 years old. At the time, he
 was president of the Harvard Law Review and a well-known figure on 
campus.

At the rally in question, Mr Obama 
said good things about Harvard Professor Mr Bell, who was 
protesting the fact that a female black professor, Regina Austin, was 
not given tenure. 

'I 
remember him sauntering up to the front and not giving us a lecture but 
engaging us in a conversation,' Mr Obama said of his memories of Mr Bell
 during their law school orientation.

Professor
 Bell was a controversial but legendary figure on Harvard's campus, as 
he was the first black dean at a non-black law school. 

'Now how did this one man do all this, 
how has he accomplished all this? He hasn't done it simply by his good 
looks and easy charm, although he has both in ample measure,' Mr Obama 
said.

He encouraged his fellow students to 'Open up your hearts and minds to the words of Professor Derrick Bell'.

The pair then hugged in front of the audience, before Mr Bell in turn addressed the crowd.

Given the size of the crowd, it was definitely a significant event on the campus, and Professor Bell's decision to take a leave of absence - and later, go on a hunger strike - in support of Ms Austin was certainly radical.

Though viewers were initially unsure 
whether or not the video was accurate, editors at Mr Breitbart's website
 confirmed that the video is the one in question but said that it had 
been 'selectively edited' by Buzzfeed's Ben Smith.

At the Conservative Political Action Conference in early February, Mr Breitbart said: 'I've got videos.

'This election we're going to vet 
him, from his college days to show you why racial division and class 
warfare are central to what hope and change was sold in 2008,' he 
continued. 

The current editors of Mr Breitbart's
 website confirmed that it is the video that their former leader was 
referencing, but added: 'The video has been selectively edited - either
 by the Boston television station or by Buzzfeed itself'.

Promise of controversy: Andrew Breitbart appeared at CPAC last month and said that he had explosive videos of a young President Obama talking about race

The footage published by Buzzfeed did
 not feature the footage of Mr Obama embracing Mr Bell, or of Mr 
Ogletree talking about the video.

Appearing on Fox News to present the 
footage in full, one of the Breitbart editors described Mr Bell as 'the 
Jeremiah Wright of academia', a reference to the controversial pastor of
 a church once attended by Mr Obama.

The footage of Mr Bell was not the first time that Mr 
Breitbart tried to use videos - or the tease of videos to come - to cause problems
 for his Democratic rivals.

His videos of Shirley Sherrod and abortion clinics made him famous, and most recently he was directly involved with the resignation of former New York congressman Anthony Weiner as he obtained the politician's sexually explicit Twitter pictures.
