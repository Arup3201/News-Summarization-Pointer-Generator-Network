John Hartson has apologised to Victor Moses after he said the Stoke City forward 'cheated' to win a penalty in their 2-1 win over Swansea.

The Potters were furious with Hartson's choice of language which was broadcast on the BBC's Match of the Day 2 on Sunday evening.

Peter Coates, the Stoke chairman, took particular offence to the comments, branding them 'disgraceful' and insisted Moses's fall following contact from Angel Rangel warranted a spot-kick.

'I've spoken With Victor Moses and apologised for my comments last week using the word cheat,' said Hartson on Friday.

'Victor has accepted my apology and we move on. I will endeavour to choose my words more carefully in the future. My stance on players diving remains the same, but understand it's part of the game.'

Moses is keen to put the matter behind him after speaking to Hartson.

'I'm grateful to John for having taken the trouble to ring me to apologise for his comments,' he said. 'I'm happy to accept his apology and am now keen to move on.'

Coates accused former Wales international Hartson of bias punditry.

'For John Hartson and Garry Monk to call Moses a cheat is disgraceful,' said Coates. 'He didn't cheat, he's not a cheat and we firmly believe those comments crossed the line.

'I thought Mark Hughes dealt with the matter well after the game but when Hartson made his comments on the Sunday night we couldn't let it go.

Moses won a penalty late in the first half for Charlie Adam to draw The Potters level against Swansea 

Referee Michael Oliver also received criticism from Swans boss Garry Monk for awarding the penalty

'I've never heard such a more one-sided view from a pundit and there was a total lack of objectivity. Hartson is a big fan of Swansea and their manager and it showed.

'We've made a complaint and we'll have to see if we get any feedback from them. We've also asked the FA to keep us informed. There comes a time when you have to take a stand.'

Garry Monk meanwhile has called for the introduction of retrospective action to stop players diving after being ordered by the FA to explain his criticisms of Moses and referee Michael Oliver.

Monk further said that he would like to see retrospective action taken in order to stop players from dving

Monk has been given until Monday by the FA to explain the scathing comments he made following Swansea's defeat.

'I've spoken to all our players. I'm not saying a Swansea player will never do it but the rules are there, the players know about it and they know how I feel,' said Monk.

'I'd like to see retrospective punishment in these situations - a fine and a ban. It's something we need to consider.

'I don't think the majority of football likes to see it. That's the only way I can see it would make players think twice about doing it.'
