A woman who had liposuction at the age of just 18 has revealed how she immediately regretted the surgery.

Writing ten years on, in a candid essay for Rookie magazine, Kate McMahon, 28, from Los Angeles, admits she was left crippled with insecurity that then spiraled into depression.

‘After all I had hoped for, I felt worse about myself,’ she writes.

Kate McMahon, 28, pictured here, wrote about having liposuction at just 18 and how she immediately regretted it, but now says; 'My stretch marks and scars remind me that I am strong and beautiful'

When describing her recovery from the liposuction, she said: ‘The physical post-op pain was extreme, but it was nothing compared to how heavy my insides were with confusion and regret.’

The physical effects of the liposuction were far from what Miss McMahon had in mind.

In her quest for the perfect skin, toned limbs and skinny waist, the results were anything but.

Whilst her thighs had shrunk, her knees appeared swollen instead of chunky.

‘My arms were the same size, but with extra skin flaps, little white stretch marks, and oozing scars,' she writes.

She adds that her stomach had extra skin that fell loose around the area.

Back at her father's home to recover, her brother had a cute friend staying at the house.

Being around an attractive boy, when she felt anything but, only made Miss McMahon regret her surgery more.

She felt humiliated in front of her family and stayed in her room, crying.

'I had hoped I would feel sexy after the procedure - now the thought
 of guys wanting me seemed ridiculous'

‘Where
 once I had hoped I would feel sexy after the procedure, now the thought
 of guys wanting me seemed impossible and ridiculous,' she writes.

But instead of sharing her distress, she attempted to pretend everything was normal.

‘I was supposed to be old enough to make this choice for myself, so I tried to act like I was fine with what I had done.’

It was during a shopping trip with her mother just before Miss McMahon’s tenth birthday, that she first conceived of the idea of being overweight.

In a dressing room, her  mother casually commented on Miss McMahon’s ‘thunder thighs,’ a comment that bred a ten-year battle with body image. 

After her mother's comments, Miss 
McMahon started eating nothing but lettuce and smoking cigarettes, 
because she had heard they, 'made people skinny.'

‘Starving
 myself seemed far easier than having to actually admit my shame and 
self-hatred about my body out loud,’ Miss McMahon writes.

As well as starving herself, she would sometimes even binge on food then make herself sick.

Miss McMahon told ABC news
 on Wednesday that she hopes the essay will teach young girls that 
plastic surgery is not necessarily the answer to body insecurities.

According to the American Society for Plastic Surgeons, 236,000 teenagers underwent cosmetic procedures in 2012, increasing by 2 percent from the previous year, reports ABC News

The
 news website reports that, according to the American Society for 
Plastic Surgeons, 236,000 teenagers underwent cosmetic procedures in 
2012, increasing by 2 percent from the previous year.

On
 another shopping trip with her mother, when she was 16, Miss McMahon 
burst into tears after struggling to find anything in a plus-sized store
 that fitted her.

Her
 mother suggested she have liposuction because, revealing had she had it
 herself to get rid of her baby weight and was happy with the results.

She also offered to pay for the surgery.

'My stretch marks and scars remind me that I am strong and beautiful'

Remarkably, when Miss McMahon broached the topic to her father, he was ‘fine’ with it.

When she was 18, she decided to go through with the procedure and had liposuction on her arms, thighs and stomach.

It was a decision she would speedily regret.

She became increasingly withdrawn, even having suicidal thoughts.

It wasn’t until a college professor expressed concern for her glaringly obvious unhappiness, that she decided to take action.

She confided in a trusted personal trainer who stressed that being happy with her weight and body meant caring for her health, not starving herself.

This sparked what Miss McMahon calls her ‘major change.’

Whilst the relationship with her mother is still scarred, Miss McMahon says that accepting and loving herself is her own choice, not her mother’s.

Now living happily in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, she takes medication for her depression, regularly attends therapy and has learnt to embrace her body.

She’s even stopped regretting her decision to have liposuction.

‘My stretch marks and scars remind me that I am strong and beautiful. Sometimes, it just takes a lot of reflection,’ she writes.

Claire Mysko, who oversees teen outreach
 at the National Eating Disorders Association, told ABC News that plastic surgery is 
often driven by deeper issues such as depression and low self-esteem.

'There’s
 this idea that if you fix the surface issue that it’s going to solve 
this feeling of inadequacy or insecurity that you’re dealing with,' she says.

'Fixing the body part that you’ve fixated on is not going to solve
 the problem.'
