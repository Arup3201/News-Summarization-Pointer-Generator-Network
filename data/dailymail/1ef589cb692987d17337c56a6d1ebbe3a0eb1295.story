Kris Boyd has completed his return to Rangers after signing a one-year contract.

The 30-year-old passed a medical at Murray Park on Friday morning to complete his second move from Kilmarnock to the Scottish Championship club.

Previous: The forward played for the club for four years between 2006-10

Boyd told 
the club's official website: 'I'm thrilled to be back, I'm a Rangers fan
 and I know everything about the club. I'm really looking forward to the
 new season and it will be a tough but exciting challenge.

'In
 football it's strange because you never know what can happen but as 
soon as I knew there was a bit of interest in me from Rangers there was 
only one place I was going.'

Boyd
 first signed for Rangers in January 2006 and netted 101 goals in 143 
games before leaving for Middlesbrough in the summer of 2010.

All smiles: It is the second time in his career that he has moved between the clubs

He
 also had spells at Nottingham Forest, Eskisehirspor in Turkey and MLS 
side the Portland Timbers before returning to Kilmarnock in February 
2013.

He struck 22 Scottish Premiership goals last season, including the winner that consigned Hibernian to the play-offs ahead of the Ayrshire side, and earned himself a Scotland recall and place on the shortlist for the PFA Scotland player of the year award.

Killie tried to keep him at Rugby Park amid offers from Aberdeen and Dundee United among others but Rangers stepped up their interest in the past week.

They have reunited Boyd with his favourite strike partner, Kenny Miller, who returned to the club earlier in the summer after leaving the Vancouver Whitecaps.

Manager Ally McCoist said: 'We've been speaking to him for a few days now and he obviously showed a great desire to come back and we were very keen for him to come back.

'It's great news for the club.'
