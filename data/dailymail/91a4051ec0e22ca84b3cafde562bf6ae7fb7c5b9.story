Manchester City winger Jesus Navas believes his team have the speed to undo Barcelona on the counter attack next week in the Champions League. 

The Spain international has also promised fans of his former club Sevilla that he wants to finish his career there.

On City's chances of knocking out Barcelona Navas told Marca: ‘We are very quick in attack and we like to play on the break. I belive we can hurt Barça in this way. That will definitely be one of our weapons.’

He also said he thought Barcelona were not the clear favourites despite them winning their last 11 games and City’s stuttering league form seeing the title slip away from them. He said: ‘I think it’s very even, I don’t see them as big favourites. Both teams have a very good chance of going through.

‘We have to be intelligent. The first game is at our place so we have to make sure we play with a lot of intensity and get a good result that we can take back to the Camp Nou.'

Navas, 29, has also got one eye on a return to Spain. Asked about finishing his career at his home club Sevilla he said: ‘It would be nice to finish up there. That is the club that have given me everything and it would be a nice ending to my career.’

Another of Manchester City's Spanish connections is the technical director of the club’s academy Rodolfo Borrell who coached Leo Messi, Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique when he worked at Barcelona’s famous La Masia youth system.

Borrell told Mundo Deportivo that Barça’s Cuidad Deportivo has nothing on City’ s new £200m Etihad Campus.

He said: ‘You can’t compare them. Ours is spectacular. But that is as you would expect when something is the latest then it can draw on more ideas for its inspiration.’

Borrell who also worked under Rafa Benitez in Liverpool’s academy helping to bring through Raheem Sterling among others backed City’s state of the art academy to be a match for Barcelona’s in terms of end product in years to come.

He said: ‘I am a Barça fan and I grew up with that way of understanding football but we are looking for our own identity here. A club cannot spend millions on players season after season. It has to create the structure that will enable it to bring through its own talent.’
