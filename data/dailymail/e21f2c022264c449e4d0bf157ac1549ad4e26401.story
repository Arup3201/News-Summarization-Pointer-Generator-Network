Signing superstars for loads of money is easy, but Louis van Gaal also knows how to upset Manchester United fans, that’s for sure.

The Old Trafford faithful – the true United fans - love Danny Welbeck, and not just because he is a Manchester lad.

I can imagine Sir Alex Ferguson feeling sick to the pit of his stomach that one of his favorites has joined Arsenal.

He would probably take it as a personal insult, but he shouldn’t. I’ll explain why later.

I like Welbeck. Very few players at United in recent years have sacrificed themselves so much for the team as he has.

If you’re one of those people who simple adds up a tally of goals and decides if a player is good or not then Welbeck isn’t for you.

But if you analyse the game with more depth, then you see the worth of Welbeck. Sir Alex Ferguson admits in his book that he ‘used’ the striker for a variety of different roles in the team, and that policy had a detrimental effect on Welbeck’s goals total.

Fergie knew he could trust him to do a job for the team, whether it was as a striker, or on the left, or even closing down Real Madrid’s Xabi Alonso in the Champions League, a job Welbeck did to perfection, until a ridiculous red card for Nani ruined Sir Alex’s final European campaign.

As a professional, Welbeck is exemplary. If you want someone to do a job and sacrifice himself for the team, he is the man.

He’s full of self-belief too, which is no bad thing.

Sacrificing himself: Welbeck put the team first rather than personal glory  

He’s not fazed by the big occasion – United fans remember his goal at the Bernebeu fondly, and he scored a wonderful back-heeled goal for England in the win over Sweden at Euro 2012.

In the Premier League he has scored goals in victories over Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal – big goals in big games.

He’s strong, quick and he can finish.

Now it is Arsene Wenger’s job to turn him into the goalscoring striker he needs, the player Ferguson always felt Welbeck could be.

He has it in him to be an absolute beast for the Gunners. I sincerely hope from an England point of view Welbeck seizes the chance.

And there’s a bigger significance in this transfer.

Signing an English player, nurtured and developed through the ranks at Manchester United is Wenger’s way of tipping his ‘chapeau’ to the greatness of Ferguson.

It’s an admission that Wenger knows that despite coming close, the Arsenal manager can never emerge from Fergie’s enormous shadow.

With Welbeck, Wenger is trying to complete a job started by Ferguson. The Arsenal boss is trying to pay the greatest tribute to his former rival. Let’s see how that goes.
