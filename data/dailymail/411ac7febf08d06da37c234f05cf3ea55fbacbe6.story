Loic Remy insists he can be fit to face Manchester United on Sunday despite limping out of Tuesday night's Champions League win against Maribor.

Remy hurt his groin and was forced to come off after scoring the opening goal in a 6-0 win at Stamford Bridge which puts Chelsea in command at the top of Group G.

It was a scare for manager Jose Mourinho ahead of the trip to Old Trafford because Diego Costa has missed the last two games with hamstring problems.

Remy was replaced by Chelsea veteran Didier Drogba with only 15 minutes of the match played 

Mourinho's post-match reaction was to rule Remy out for 'a couple of weeks' but the France striker will go for a scan today and refuses to give up on the idea of starting against United.

'I don't think it is too bad,' said Remy. 'I felt something in my groin. We will see with the scan. I really hope it's not too bad. Fortunately I stopped playing because I felt something.'

The problem was evident before he scored but when he drove the ball into the net he winced and pulled up quickly. He was replaced by Didier Drogba two minutes later, with only 15 minutes gone.

But the French striker is in visible discomfort after opening the scoring against Maribor 

'Even in my run I didn't feel comfortable,' said Remy. 'It was a bit stiff. That's why I prefer to come off. I have to care about myself and if I'm not feeling very good it's better to leave for another player who is 100 per cent.

'It's frustrating of course because I had a chance to play because Costa is injured but I am not afraid. I don't think it is really bad. We will check and I really hope to play again this weekend.

'It is a huge game. Every game is tough and especially this one because it is a big game against a good opponent. I will try to recover as quickly as possible.'

Costa's prolific form has limited Remy to only three starts since his summer move from Queen's Park Rangers.

'For me, I have more motivation like that because I know I have to work more than the other players to have a chance to play,' said the 27-year-old France international. 'That's why I work hard every day at training to show the manager that I can play and score.

Chelsea's star striker Diego Costa has missed the last two games with hamstring issues 

'When I came to Chelsea, I knew there was a team, so I couldn't come and play straight away. So I was waiting. This kind of situation can happen when someone is injured and you take his place. I was happy to score.

'Every game I play I want to score but I don't put stupid pressure on myself. I just want to give my best every game. Even if I am not scoring I want to give assist or help the team as much as possible with my runs.

'I don't put pressure but I know I have to score because Diego is a good striker and scoring a lot of goals so if I can help the team I do it.

'I think we can win the Champions League, but we will take game after game. We have enough quality to win it but the way is long and taking it game by game is better.'

Veteran striker Drogba, who has started only once since his return in the summer, is Chelsea's only fully-fit centre forward.

If Remy is ruled out by today's scan, Mourinho will have to start with the 36-year-old Ivorian at Manchester United or hope he can patch-up Costa to return despite his hamstring injuries.

At the start of the week, the Chelsea manager claimed nine-goal Costa had 'very little' chance of being ready for Old Trafford and he was nowhere to be seen last night among the non-playing players who watched the game at Stamford Bridge.
