Tickr asks users to post short 20-second videos in the place of photos

A bit of filter-action and the right angle can make anyone look good on Tinder.

But there has been a backlash against the dating-app, and others like it, which relies almost exclusively on appearance to create matches.

Now a competitor is gearing up to launch an iPhone app  that could mean the end of these mismatches.

The London-based service is called Tickr and will ask users to post videos in the place of heavily-filtered photos.

It is currently available online, and an app version is due to go live next month.

Users have to upload clips that are around 20 seconds long, showing a part of their personality or their hobbies.

In a similar way to Tinder's rating system, users earn 'ticks' if they are liked and 'icks' if not.

If two members both tick each other, Tickr announces a match and they can start talking through text or video messaging.

'If you just can't decide whether to tick 'em or ick 'em, just put a pin in it and click Stick.

'We'll save the video for you to watch later,' the company wrote on its website.

Users can also go through profile pictures to find those they like, but the general aim is to provide a more 'genuine' dating experience by watching videos.  

Users can sign up at Trustyourtickr.com in advance of the iOS app launch and upload videos using a desktop.

The first 5,000 people to sign up will get free lifetime membership. After that, it costs £10 ($17) a month.

Chris de Burgh found her irresistible, and now scientists say that ladies wearing red really are more attractive to men.

A new study claims that wearing the colour increases a woman's sex appeal and also makes her seem more approachable and competent. It found that women also find red attractive on men - but the effect isn't as powerful.

Psychologists at Central China Normal University, in Wuhan, China, showed 280 heterosexual students 32 pictures of the opposite sex and asked them to rate them according to how attractive they found them.

The people in the photos were wearing either blue, white or red. Male students found 'feminine' women wearing red the most attractive and also rated them highest for looking 'warm' and competent.
