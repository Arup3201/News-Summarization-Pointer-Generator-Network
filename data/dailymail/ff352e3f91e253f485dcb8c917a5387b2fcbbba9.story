Parents have attacked a 'disgusting' new television advert for a life insurance company - which appears to show a monster urinating on a customer in a bath.

The bizarre TV campaign for Beagle Street life insurance was given a restriction preventing it from being shown around children's programmes.

It was, however, broadcast numerous times during the day and in the early evening leading to more than 50 complaints made to the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA).

The advert was shown on a number of channels, including during a showing of movie About A Boy on ITV and Gogglebox on Channel 4 as well as on Comedy Central, STV and the History Channel.  

The advert starts with a man reading a newspaper as he takes a relaxing soak in the tub.

But two seconds in, a monster appears and turns on a tap between his legs before spraying a jet of water at the shocked man's face.

The bizarre ad for Beagle Street life insurance shows a man soaking in the bath before a monster appears

Two seconds into the 30-second advert, the large gremlin-like creature  turns on a tap between his legs

Parents blasted the ad for being shown before the watershed as it appears to show a man being urinated on 

The gremlin then roars, scaring the customer into leaping out of the bath as a voiceover says: 'Life insurance can be a bit of a nightmare.'

A few seconds later, the monster suddenly explodes - sending fluff all over the man - before turning into a cute Furby-like character.

The voiceover then comes back in, adding: 'But Beagle Street is different. A simple, friendly life insurance service online.'

The new smaller creature then says 'Hello Roger, little back rub?' before the 30-second advert ends with the company website.

Beagle Street say it is aimed at engaging with a new generation of customers who don't have or understand life insurance.

The campaign, launched by advertising company The Corner London, who describe it as 'a cheeky dig at the old way of life insurance'.

But furious parents blasted the company and said the 'disturbing' advert - called 'Life insurance. Reborn' - had given their young children nightmares.

One said: 'I don't have problems with ads but this one is really freaking out my four-year-old nephew who has stopped the family from turning the TV on.

'He doesn't even have a bath because he's too frightened of the gremlin jumping out in the bath.

'He is screaming and won't go up to bed in time, he takes his mum up to bed at 8pm with her and won't let anyone switch television on at all.'

In a strange turn of events, the monster disappears leaving feathers and a Furby-like creature in its place

Another parent added: 'This advert is not suitable for daytime viewing. My two-year-old son cries as soon as it starts now and we have to act quickly to turn the channel over.

'Whoever came up with this advertising campaign clearly does not have children and in my view has completely driven away families from ever using their services.

'It should not be shown in the daytime or even at all as it's a ridiculous advert for the product it is attempting to promote.'

One disgusted view said: 'It is a horrible advert, totally repellent, and I do not understand why anyone would be compelled to buy life insurance from this company.

'Also, although I do see that the monster in the corner is squirting water from the tap at the man in the bath, it looks like he is weeing on him.

'This one ought to be banned - or limited to The Horror Channel.'

Another parent fumed: 'My two-year-old experienced terrible nightmares after seeing this advert.

'Kids do not need to see this kind of advertising and to be honest, most adults don't need to either. Ban it please.' 

Viewers also took to social media to express their disgust.

Sarah Sanderson wrote on Twitter: 'It's 8.10pm and that stupid #BeagleStreet advert has come on. Surely it's a tad scary for kids? (Mine is in bed!)'

Alisha Mann added: 'What is with that beagle street ad??? its gross and disturbing, makes me feel sick #BeagleStreet #grossedout'

And Kirsty Boden said: 'Just witnessed THE sketchiest life insurance ad ever... Scarred! #beaglestreet' 

The Advertising Standards Agency received 55 complaints and others took to Twitter to express their disgust 

Defending the campaign, Neil Simpson, founding partner of The Corner London, said: 'There are so many barriers to life insurance at the moment, hence the need for a simplification.

'We believe the campaign is altogether very un-life insurance in a good way.'

On their website, the advertising company say: 'Our launch campaign takes a cheeky dig at the old way of life insurance and introduces the cutest of characters that is the embodiment of Beagle Street...life insurance reborn.' 

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) confirmed they had received 55 complaints about the advert.

They also revealed the campaign had been given an ex-kids restriction by Clearcast - meaning it shouldn't be broadcast around programmes that appeal to children.

A spokesperson for the ASA said they were looking into the complaints to see if the advert should be investigated.

They added: 'Generally complaints about the ad have said it is offensive and inappropriate for children.

'This ad has been shown at a variety of times during the day and early evening.

'The ad was given an ex-kids restriction by Clearcast. An ex-kids restriction means that it should not be broadcast in or around programmes with particular appeal to children.

'This means it could appear at any time of the day, but shouldn't appear during ad breaks for kids programmes.

'We are currently investigating these complaints to see if the ad should be investigated.'
