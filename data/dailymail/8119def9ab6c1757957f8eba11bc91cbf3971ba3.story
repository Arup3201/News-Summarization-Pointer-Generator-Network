A mother screamed at a London Underground driver from a station platform to stop after a train left with her baby on board, it was revealed last night.

The woman, who had placed the child in its pram on the train before returning to the platform at the busy South Kensington station in central London, went to pick up her luggage when the doors shut.

Malcolm Dyer, 59, of Ascot, Berkshire, who witnessed the incident last Wednesday at 1:10pm, said the woman immediately started to panic and he told someone to pull the emergency handle.

The fire consultant told the London Evening Standard: ‘I saw the woman try to get on the train as the doors were closing. Most people have done it before - just jumped on at the last minute.

‘But she had a pram and luggage, so it obviously took longer. The doors were going “Beep, beep, beep” and closed before she got on. She was screaming “Stop, stop, stop”.’

The train came to a halt after another passenger pulled the emergency handle - but the driver came over the intercom to announce he would have to continue to the next stop for safety, Mr Dyer said.

He added that he looked after the child - believed to be aged 12 months - with another couple until the next stop, Gloucester Road, where he alighted with the baby and spoke to the driver.

Transport for London staff at South Kensington had already phoned through to their Gloucester Road colleagues to alert them about the incident, and the mother and child were later reunited.

South Kensington station, which sits close to many of London’s major museums, is served by the Piccadilly, District and Circle lines. The train in question was operating on the latter line.

Pete Allaway, London Underground’s Circle and Hammersmith line manager, said that he wanted to thank his ‘quick-thinking’ staff for their reaction to the incident.

He told the Evening Standard: ‘I’d also like to thank the customers on the train who alerted the driver and stayed with the baby until the train could be met by station staff.’
