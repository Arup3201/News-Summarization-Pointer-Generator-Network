 weird and wonderful kites.

From 10ft high pandas to 20ft long whales, spectators have been wowed by kites of all colours, shapes and sizes.

More than 600,000 people attend the festival, which has been running for more than a quarter of a century each April.

Stunt kites compete against each other and teams put on choreographed displays during the festival.

This
 is a festival where everyone expects the unexpected â€“ a mauve bear 
holding its arms out to an octopus, for instance, and a skate with a 
long black tail jostling with a group of aerial jellyfish.

It attracts flyers from all over the world and, for once, those representing England are actually pretty good at this particular sport.

But they face strong competition from their French, Japanese and American counterparts.

The festival runs until April 21.
