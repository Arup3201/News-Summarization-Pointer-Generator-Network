Two police forces have apologised for failing to warn a mother that she and her two young children were living with a predatory paedophile for two years.

Cheryle Hibbert, 42, shared a home with Dan Brasier when he faced child sex offences and even gave birth to his baby.

Despite lessons supposedly learned from the Soham murders, two separate forces failed to tell Miss Hibbert the truth about her lover.

Let down: Cheryle Hibbert shared a home with Dan Brasier unaware he was facing child sex offences

Under rules set up after the murders of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman the mother should have been informed about the claims against him.

But police supposedly monitoring his bail failed to stop him living with young children or tell Miss Hibbert he was under investigation.

Brasier even managed to keep his conviction secret from the mother for several months after his case in 2011.

Apologies: Two police forces failed to inform Cheryle Hibbert that she was living with paedophile Dan Brasier

He admitted making indecent photos of children, performing a sex act in front of a child and attempting to procure a child for sex.

He escaped with a three-year supervision order and went back to Miss Hibbert and her two young children, in Helston, Cornwall as if nothing had happened.

She eventually dumped Brasier a few months later after receiving an anonymous text asking 'R Ur kids safe?'.

Thames Valley Police, who had 
prosecuted Brasier, failed to pass on details of the case to Devon and 
Cornwall Police where Miss Hibbert was living with Brasier.

Detective
Superintendent Nora Holford claimed their procedures were now 'far more
robust' when dealing with child pornography offenders and reviewing 
bail arrangements.

She added: 'We are very aware of the huge consequences this has had for you and continues to have.'

A
second force, Avon and Somerset Police, helped Thames Valley Police 
with Braiser's arrest and was also supposed to monitor his bail 
conditions.

In a letter to 
Miss Hibbert, Inspector Mike Ashwin wrote: 'I accept responsibility for 
my staff not applying bail conditions despite the lack of apparent 
dialogue with the officer in the case and for that I also sincerely 
apologise to you.'

Brasier first came to the attention 
of police in August 2007 when he was caught grooming a '14-year-old 
girl' - who was in fact a Metropolitan Police officer.

Scotland
Yard alerted Thames Valley Police to Brasier's home in Bracknell, 
Berkshire, where computers containing child sex images were found.

While on bail Brasier moved to Cornwall where he met Miss Hibbert while they walked their dogs.

Miss Hibbert, a civil servant at the Royal Naval Air Station in Culdrose, said: 'It was shocking that not just one police force but two failed in its duty.

'I think all police forces need to take heed and ensure they are protecting people from predatory sex offenders like Brasier.'
