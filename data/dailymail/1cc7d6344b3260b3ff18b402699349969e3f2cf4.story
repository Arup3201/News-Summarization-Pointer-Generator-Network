When John Dyson and his wife Faith moved to a sleepy corner of southern France, they were hoping for a peaceful retirement.

But within months of settling in the village of Brugairolles, they found themselves embroiled in a bitter feud with their neighbour – another British expatriate – over access to their front door.

The French media have dubbed it La Guerre des Britanniques (The War of the Britons) after Forbes Dunlop nailed up the Dysons’ window shutters and blocked their front door with wooden fence posts secured with cement.

Dispute: 100 villagers ripped down a brick and wooden wall built across this home (right), which belongs to British couple John and Faith Dyson. It was the final chapter in a 10-year row with their neighbours

Mr Dunlop is believed to object to his neighbours being able to look out over ‘his’ driveway.

His
 fury has prompted him to write to everyone from his local police force
 back in Scotland to the  European Court of Human Rights, while one 
85-page epic was even sent to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

The
 latest development saw the Dysons forced to come and go via their back 
garden instead of the driveway leading to the pair of stone houses, 
which Mr Dunlop, 67, says they have no right to use.

Far
 from dismissing the row among ‘les rosbifs’ with a Gallic shrug, French
 residents of the village – population 258 – have rallied round the 
Dysons, with some 60 of them marching on the properties ‘to rescue’ the 
couple.

‘We
 could not accept that they should continue to live under such terror,’ 
said Jeannot Gach, 83, a retired policeman. ‘We shouted, whistled 
against their unscrupulous neighbours.’

South
 African-born Mr Dyson, 72, a retired engineer, moved to Brugairolles, 
in the foothills of the Pyrenees, with his wife in 2004 from 
Storrington, West Sussex.

Mr
 Dunlop, formerly from Strathclyde, and his wife Krystyna, thought to be
 Polish, moved there eight months later – and soon began raising 
objections over the Dysons’ windows, which overlook the driveway.

Although
 access to the driveway was not written into the property’s deeds, 
French law guarantees right of way if an entrance has been used 
continuously for at least 30 years.

The
 Dysons have produced a series of affidavits to confirm this is the case
 with their house, and a local civil court will now rule on the matter. 
‘For the last 150 years, the only access to the house was from that 
drive,’ said Mr Dyson.

‘They knew all this before they even bought their house.’

Mr Dunlop has refused to comment, telling one reporter: ‘I am deaf, I cannot hear what you say, I am deaf.'
