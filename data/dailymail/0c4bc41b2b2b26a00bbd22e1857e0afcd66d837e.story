An artist has created a colourful chandelier constructed almost entirely out of 8,500 hand-cast acrylic gummy bears.

Kevin Champeny spent months creating 'Candelier' for home furnishings company Jellio and was behind the sweet-inspired furnishings in the bedroom of Carly Shay, the main character in Nickelodeon's hit teen sitcom iCarly.

Mr Champeny creates large artworks that look like sculptures or mosaics, but a closer investigation reveals they are made of hundreds or thousands of tiny objects, often individually cast by the artist.

Light snack: A chandelier made from over 8500 gummiy bears has been created by artist Kevin Champeney

Tasty art: His sculpture take months to complete and straddle the line between sculpture and mosaic

Intricate: None of the gummy bears were painted and each batch had to be cast in the right colour

His artwork 'Flag is an American flag made up of 44,450 urethane army men cast in red, white, and blue, while 'What Remains' is a five foot wide skull mosaic made up of more than 35,000 tiny flowers.

'A Rose By Any Other Name' is another candy-themed work and uses more than 15,000 acrylic pieces of candy and weighs 75lbs.

He starts by building silicone moulds of the original pieces, then casts them in colour, meaning nothing is painted, each hue has to be mixed and cast using various resins.

The final objects numbering in the tens of thousands are then painstaking glued to a surface piece by piece, meaning that the entire process for each artwork spans several months to design, sculpt and cast.

Good enough to eat?: Those with a sweet tooth will be disappointed to learn the treats are cast in acrylic

Art: Other works by Mr Champeny include a human skull made from tiny flowers and a rose created using various types of sweets
