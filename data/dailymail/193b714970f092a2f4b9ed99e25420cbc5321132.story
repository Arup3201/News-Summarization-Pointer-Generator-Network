An adorable Washington state toddler has died after his grandfather accidentally backed over him with a ride on lawn mower.

According to Whatcom County sheriff's office, Jack Joseph Kelley was playing in the yard on Saturday while his 67-year-old grandfather cut the grass with a John Deere riding mower.

The mower backed over the boy, killing him instantly, sheriff Bill Elfo said. The child was just days shy of his second birthday.

Results of an autopsy had not been released as of Wednesday but Elfo said evidence does not suggest a crime, rather a devastating tragedy.

'It's what appears to be a tragic, freak accident,' he told The Bellingham Herald.

It is unclear if the boy was crushed or how else he may have died. No other details have been released.

Deputies believe the grandfather had been visiting the boy's parents at their Ferndale home when the accident happened.
