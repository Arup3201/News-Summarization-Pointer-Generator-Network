Attorney-General George Brandis is under pressure after Prime Minister Tony Abbott decided to back down on plans to water down the Racial Discrimination Act without telling him.

The controversial changes to the act, which were discussed for over six months, had been ridiculed by the opposition, ethnic leaders, the public and his own party.

The Abbott government wanted to reform section 18C of the act after Andrew Bolt was found to have breached the act with a Herald Sun column.

The amendments would have scrapped a prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating individuals based on race.

Attorney General George Brandis was told by Tony Abbott on Tuesday morning that his legislation to change the racial discrimination act had to be dropped

On his radio show on Tuesday, Bolt attacked former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell after the disgraced politician slammed his comments criticising Mr Abbott's decision not to repeal 18C.

'Hello to Barry...pour yourself another expensive red, one you might have forgotten you actually had there,' he said on Sydney's 2GB, prompting laughter from his co-host Steve Price.

Bolt was referring to the scandal that brought down Mr O'Farrell, when he was forced to admit he gave inaccurate evidence to a corruption inquiry about receiving a bottle of Grange wine from a lobbyist.

Mr O'Farrell had tweeted during the radio show, condemning Bolt's strong criticism of the government's decision, saying the comments were 'so irrational they're almost humorous'.

In a newspaper column, called 'It's so hip to be black', Bolt wrote: 'Meet the white face of a new black race — the political Aborigine.'

The News Corp columnist was allegedly briefed on the backdown and hour before the public were told of it, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

But on his radio show, he said: 'What he is saying is the very people, the very ethnic groups that would take exception to 18C are the same ones that are, in part, some of them, affected or take offence to the anti-terrorism legislation.

'To make them feel not picked on he'll retain laws against free speech,' Bolt said.

Attorney-General Brandis has previously said Australians have a 'right to be bigots' when defending his changes.

The repeal of 18C, an Abbott government election commitment, has been widely criticised as a watering down of protections against racism.

Section 18C of the act makes it unlawful to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

More than 5500 submissions flooded into the Attorney-General's office following the release of draft laws in March.

Only a handful have been released but the majority reportedly opposed the changes.

A government source told the Sydney Morning Herald the changes were to keep 'the moderate Muslim community' onside.

'The purpose of the exposure draft was to get community feedback and the feedback has been "don't change it". As part of combating terrorism, we want the moderate Muslim community to be onside. One of the sticking points has been 18C,' they said.

Andrew Bolt was one of the first to comment on the government's announcement on Tuesday, blaming the move on lobby groups who 'hate free speech'

An April poll published by Fairfax Media showed 88 per cent of respondents believed it should be illegal to offend, insult or humiliate someone based on their race.

The PM admitted the proposed changes to section 18C of the act had 'complicated' relations with ethnic groups.

Coalition backbenchers joined the opposition, and Labor leader Bill Shorten says that's why the 'deeply unpopular' changes have been ditched.

'What is clear ... is that the Attorney-General has been rolled by his cabinet,' Mr Shorten told reporters.

The government had been humiliated and embarrassed by the proposal, he said, which was flagged one year ago.

'This has been a dreadful waste of national energy,' the opposition leader said.

The Australian Greens have repeatedly questioned the government's motive behind the changes, after political commentator Andrew Bolt fell foul to 18C for a column questioning the motives of lighter-skinned Aboriginal people.

Mr Bolt was one of the first to comment on the government's announcement on Tuesday, blaming the move on lobby groups who "hate free speech".

'I suspect the country will be poorer for this,' he said.

The government may have backed down on Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, but Mr Abbott reconfirmed the law needed to changed.

'But I want the communities of our country to be our friend, not our critic,' he said.

'I want to work with the communities of our country as 'Team Australia' here.

'The government's perfectly reasonable attempt to amend Section 18C has become a complication we just don't need and we won't proceed with,' he added.

Tony Abbott will roll out the most dramatic changes to Australian security laws in more than a decade

On Tuesday, Mr Abbott also revealed it will now be a crime for an Australian citizen to travel to a region considered by the government as a 'terrorist hostile area'.

The PM announced dramatic new anti-terror laws, which aim to stop the increasing number of Australians heading overseas to join terrorist fighters. It will also include the expansion of the definition of terrorism beyond 'terrorist activities' to threats on social media.

'These are provisions, that for a person who travels to a designated spot identified as a terrorist hostile area, will be a crime,' Mr Abbott said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that in Afghanistan, up to 30 Australians had been identified as fighting alongside extremists but 'five times that number are now of interest, fighting overseas or becoming involved'.

Tony Abbott confirmed that the new definition would encompass the behaviour of social media jihadists such as Mohamed Elomar, who has tweeted pictures of himself holding decapitated heads, and make them liable for prosecution.

The announcement of the new laws and an extra $630 million in government spending on anti-terrorist measures, comes as Elomar, the 30-year-old former boxer fighting with terrorists in the Middle East, posted claims of how to access deadly explosives in Sydney.

The 30-year-old invited jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades.

'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he tweeted.

The new law is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government, under which Australians could be arrested for travelling to certain terrorist 'hot spots' without a valid humanitarian reason, causing fears that the onus of proof will rest on Australians who visit these areas to prove they did so innocently.

One of the most controversial proposed measures would see the phone and internet records of all Australians held for two years.

This would apply to metadata, rather than the content of calls and emails. Metadata is information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers, email addresses and the dates, times, locations and duration of phone calls.

Under the new laws, the tweets of Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar could be classed as terrorism

During criminal or intelligence investigations this content can be accessed, though monitoring phone or internet use over a long period requires a warrant.

Attorney-General George Brandis said last week that data collection and surveillance was necessary for dealing with the 'insidious threat' of home-grown terrorism.

The laws have drawn criticism from Labor, the Greens and civil rights groups.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the changes had been forced on the Prime Minister and Attorney-General, claiming that ‘George Brandis has been humiliated by his colleagues’.

‘Today’s back down to allow bigots to be bigots, is a victory for ordinary people,’ Mr Shorten added.

‘His (Brandis’) priority as Attorney-General has allowed racists to be racist.’

Adam Bandt, acting leader of the Australian Greens acting leader said the test for any data retention or surveillance should be whether a person is 'reasonably suspected of having committed a crime'.

'To simply say everything you do online will be stored now and made available to government is over-reach,' Mr Bandt said.   

This is the second suite of anti-terror laws introduced by the government in recent months.

In July the government introduced legislation that could allow Australian police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries and tender the evidence in Australian courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases.

The laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against Australians who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), pictured marching in Syria

The law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war, like Syria, or ‘failed states’ like Somalia.

Other changes include the power to suspend people's passports in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice and allowing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to pass on intelligence about Australians to its domestic counterpart, ASIO, under certain circumstances.

The changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism.
