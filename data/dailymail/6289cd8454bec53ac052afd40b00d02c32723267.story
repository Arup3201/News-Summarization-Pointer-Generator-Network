A winter storm system brought even more snow to parts of New England early Sunday, only a week after a Nor’easter all but crippled the region. 

The storm, christened Plato by the Weather Channel, brought up to eight inches of snow to areas of New Hampshire and Maine.

The station forecasts that Boston will end up with six to 12 inches and Providence, Rhode Island, will be slammed with four to eight.

Eastern Canada will also see several inches before the storm's end.

Forecast: Snow associated with a low pressure storm will slowly dissipate over northern New England today and tomorrow, bringing cold weather

Impending: Moderate to heavy snowfall is expected in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts; other East Coast Cities will likely be spared the weather system

Chill factor: The Eastern Seaboard - and much of the country - is in for a chilly few days

The Weather Channel reports that other metropolitan areas along the Eastern Seaboard, including New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., will likely miss the squall.

It is the same storm pattern that brought near-whiteout conditions in the Carolinas on Saturday.

According to the NOAA, parts of Maine, including the Northeast, East Central, and Western parts, are all under a blizzard warning until Monday at 4pm.

Drivers are urged to stay off the road during blizzard-like conditions as visibility is reduced to nearly nothing. 

Boston.com reports that Cape Cod could experience four to seven inches of snow. The Cape could also see gale-force winds from the violent storm coming in from the sea.

The effects of last weekend’s Nor’easter were especially felt in Boston, where many streets remained unplowed days after the storm and more than 200,000 customers were left without power. 

Nemo dumped some 22 inches of snow in Long Island, and some parts of Connecticut were slammed with more than 34 inches.

AccuWeather reports that the Atlantic coast of Canada will be slammed with hurricane-force winds and significant snowfall as well.

Its meteorologists predict that New Brunswick, Quebec, and Nova Scotia will all be hit with anywhere between eight and 15 inches of snowfall.

The current storm comes just as many New England and Canadian residents finished digging out from the storm only the week before.
