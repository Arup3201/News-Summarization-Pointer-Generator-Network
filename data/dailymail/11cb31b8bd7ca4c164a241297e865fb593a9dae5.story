They were supposed to be presenting a united front before tomorrow's Budget marks the unofficial end of the coalition.

But David Cameron and Nick Clegg looked more like the cast of Armageddon as they marched through a dark tunnel in bright orange overalls.

Both men rushed to claim credit for a sharp rise in the minimum wage, but behind the smiles there are deep divisions over which tax cuts will be announced by George Osborne tomorrow.

In the depths of the eurozone crisis in 2011, Vince Cable warned of an 'Armageddon scenario' if the single currency collapsed.

But the government hopes to set out a more upbeat picture this week, claiming to have brought the British economy back from the brink. 

Tomorrow's Budget is expected to include a promise of tax cuts for low and middle earners, extra money for mental health and freedom for pensioners to turn their retirement into a cash lump sum.

Today Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg made a joint announcement on rises in the minimum wage.

Mr Cameron hopes to use the Budget to catapult the Tories into a poll lead ahead of the election on May 7

The rate for apprentices will rise sharply by 57p from £2.73 per hour to £3.30 - 50p more than had been recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission. 

Ministers said the proposed small hike in the rate for apprentices failed to reflect efforts to boost the status of vocational alternatives as a way into well-paid jobs - and went beyond the recommendation for the second time in three years.

Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg met apprentices working on a major transport project to promote the change - in one of their last joint appearances as coalition partners before May's general election.

'No-one should earn less than £3 an hour,' Mr Cameron said after touring work beneath London on a station for the capital's new Crossrail link.

'It is a good deal, it is right for our country and we can only do it because we have got a strong economy.

'I have been talking to apprentices here who after two or three years as an apprentice could be earning £25-£26,000 a year. That's right. That's what I want for our country - a country where if you work hard and do the right thing you get rewarded.'

Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg both defended a sharp rise in the minimum wage for apprentices to over £3 an hour

Mr Clegg said the 'vast majority' of employers already paid apprentices at least that sum but that it was right to significantly increase the minimum.

'Generally governments do what the Low Pay Commission says,' he said. 'But on this occasion we felt that ... £2.80 - that is still pretty low, even for apprentices to get by on.'

Even though it was right that they earned less than full-time workers 'they do nonetheless need to be paid in a way that allows them to earn and learn, get their qualifications and then move on to full-time employment'.

With just two weeks until the start of the election campaign, both men will hope to avoid heading to the exit door

CBI director-general John Cridland said the overruling on the apprentice rate was 'disappointing'.

'The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years, thanks to the independence of the commission - its politicisation is worrying,' he said.

Concerns were also raised by Federation of Small Businesses chairman John Allan who said the large rise came on top of other increased apprenticeship costs and would have to be 'monitored closely', and by British Retail Consortium director general Helen Dickinson who warned that any significant departure 'risks upsetting the fine balance struck by the LPC and potentially negatively impacting workers, the economy or both'.

But Sharon Spice, director of student recruitment at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said the rise would 'help remove some of the stigma around apprenticeships being a second rate career option, making them more attractive to young people' though more funding was needed to support small businesses in offering them.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said there should have been a 'much bolder increase' in the main rate.

'With one in five workers getting less than a living wage, this is nowhere near enough to end in-work poverty. Britain's minimum-wage workers should be very fearful of the billions of pounds of cuts to government help for the low-paid that the Chancellor is planning if re-elected,' she said.
