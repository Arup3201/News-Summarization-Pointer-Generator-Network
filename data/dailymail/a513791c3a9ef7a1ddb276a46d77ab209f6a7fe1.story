Horrific end: Sean Janas, 20, was arrested after allegedly forcing her boyfriend's dog to drink bleach for months before slitting its throat

A 20-year-old woman tortured her boyfriend's dog for months by forcing it to drink bleach before killing it by slitting its throat.

Sean Janas, of Wausau, Wisconsin allegedly wrote about how pleased she was to carry out the horrific mistreatment of the pet dog.

In her diary she wrote: 'The pleasure I get from watching her whimper in pain and cry out for help as I shove Drano and bleach down her throat is like no other'.

Janas was arrested on animal cruelty 
charges after her boyfriend found her diary where she detailed the 
torture of his pet called Mary.

In the diary, she allegedly plotted out a way to dispose of the dog without anyone knowing that it was her.

'I need to find a way to kill her (the dog) without it looking like I killed her,' Janas wrote.
