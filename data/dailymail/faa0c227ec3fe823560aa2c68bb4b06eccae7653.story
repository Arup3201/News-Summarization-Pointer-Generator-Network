An Australian Olympian who has struggled openly with depression and recently pleaded guilty to drug charges has broken her silence and spoken about some of the darkest days of her life including taking drugs.

In an exclusive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair, former diver Chantelle Newbery, who claimed the first Australian gold medal in 80 years at the 2004 Athens Olympics, opened up about her drug use following her mother's death to breast cancer.

'I have experimented with a couple of things but I wouldn't say I was a drug user,' Newbery told the Nine Network.

'On and off, perhaps every now and then, since then but there's been no period of time where I have been using drugs or anything like that.'

Former Olympic champion Chantelle Newbery has spoken out for the first time in detail about her drug charges and battle with mental health

The mother-of-two said she resorted to trying drugs - on and off - around the time of her mother's death 18 months ago. Her mother spent her final year living with her.

Newbery said her experience with drugs was that 'it doesn't help' and it was behind her now.

'Mum fought a pretty good fight, she was diagnosed with breast cancer three years before she passed away and she lived with me in the final year and she passed away in our home,' she said.

The 37-year-old pleaded guilty to possession of dangerous drugs and failing to properly dispose of syringes earlier this month. She was placed on a drug diversion program and no conviction was recorded.

She also spoke of the time she tried to take her own life. 'I had never faced anything like that before, I had never in trouble with the law before... So it was a little bit overwhelming for me,' she said.

At the peak of her career Newbery broke records but after 2004 she struggled with mental illness and personal demons

The former darling of the diving platform relived the moment eight police officers raided her home looking for drug paraphernalia, searching her house, car and through all of her belongings.

'I was asleep at the time, The police came to my house and told me they were searching for drugs... They did find drug paraphernalia,' she said.

However, the former Olympian insisted that they did not turn up any actual drugs, and the used needles and plastic zip-lock bags discovered did not actually belong to her.

Refusing the name the actual owner of the items, Newberry described how overwhelmed she was by the situation as the reason she took the blame.

She welled up as Tracey Grimshaw asked her whether she had pleaded guilty to the to protect someone she cared about.

'Yes that is fair,' she responded.

On why she pleaded guilty, Newbery revealed 'I was overwhelmed on the day, I was hysterical'.

At the peak of her career in the pool, the golden girl broke records when at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games she became the first Australian in 80 years, and the first Australian woman ever, to win gold on the diving board.

The mum-of-two has previously spoken publicly of her battle with depression, and said she struggled again with her mental health after her mother died.

The mum-of-two told the program the drug paraphernalia found in her house did not belong to her, but admitted to experimenting with substances in the past

And though she did experiment with drugs during tumultuous times in her life, Newbery said at no point would she have described herself as 'a drug user'.

Since then she has battled with grief, financial difficulty and finding a permanent place to live.

All this combined with the breakdown of her marriage with fellow diver Robert, the father of her two boys, saw Newberry plunge into a dark place again.

Five years ago she attempted suicide, but said despite the ongoing hardship she has faced since she has never resorted to that again.

Newbery revealed that she has struggled financially, had trouble finding a place to settle down but her focus now is on providing a stable life for her two sons

Newbery has come up against many challenges over the past decade, but revealed her focus has now shifted to rebuilding her life and focusing on her two sons, Ryder and Jet.

'I feel pretty bulletproof when I'm at home being a mum ... I'm a mum and I've got a job to do, and you've just got to get on and do it,' the gold medallist said.

She also revealed she regualrly sees a psychologist, and insisted that no one would ever find drug paraphernalia in any home she was living in again.

Newbery, who revealed in 2009 that she suffered depression, said while she hoped to work with divers in the future, her main priority was being a mother to her two sons.

'At the moment I just want to spend time just being a mum.'
