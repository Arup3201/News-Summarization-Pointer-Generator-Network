Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell has the chance to further prove to Arsene Wenger on Saturday that he is worthy of a place in Arsenal's squad next season.

But Wenger is set to farm Campbell out on loan again. Campbell, 22, spent last season in Greece playing for Olympiakos.

But Wenger is more inclined to loan Campbell to a Premier League club - at least until January - this season. West Ham, Everton, Southampton and Newcastle are all interested.

One of the features of this World Cup has been the number of headed goals - there have been 32 so far. Surely the best remains Robin van Persie’s supreme diving header in Holland’s opening win over Spain.

It’s nearly twice as likely for a goal to be scored in the second half of Saturday's games. So far 94 have been scored in the second half compared to 57 in the first half, with seven having been struck in extra time.

Marouane Fellaini has stated he has nothing to prove to Manchester United when he plays for Belgium against Argentina on Saturday.

Even if he wanted to make a point, it is a bit late for that. New manager Louis van Gaal has agreed with the club’s hierarchy to sell the player signed from Everton for £27million last summer.

A move back to Everton or Newcastle is on the cards but both clubs won’t want to pay more than a cut price £12m. A loan move is a possibility.

Former England boss Glenn Hoddle has said he no longer wants to see Brazil win the World Cup in their own back yard because they are not playing Samba football.

His point is backed up by the fact that their goals in the knockout phase have been scored by their defenders - the strongest part of their team - with David Luiz netting twice and Thiago Silva once.

Indeed ex-Chelsea star Luiz - now of PSG - could become the icon of this team if they go on to win the tournament.

With pin-up star Neymar, still their top scorer with four goals, ruled out of the World Cup, Luiz - who scored a wonder free-kick in the 2-1 win over Columbia - has now emerged as Brazil's talisman - much to Hoddle’s dismay.

Former Liverpool striker of the Seventies David Fairclough was the first player in English football to be dubbed a supersub because of his knack of coming off the bench (in the days when there was only one sub) and scoring vital goals.

This World Cup has become the tournament of the super sub. So far 29 goals have been scored by subs compared to 15 in 2010

One to Watch: 

Lets hope it’s a sight to behold rather than a kicking - or diving - match and we see Arjen Robben or Robin van Persie - or both - rise to the occasion and set up a semi-final most likely against Lionel Messi and Argentina in a battle of Jogo Bonito.

World Cup Moment:

After putting England to the sword in the quarter finals of the 1986 World Cup finals, Maradona then put on another one-man demolition show in the semis against Belgium - scoring twice in Argentina's 2-0 win.

I Say:Phil Neville’s nightmare performance as commentator in the England v Italy game has seen Danny Murphy move up the packing order.

And the ex-Liverpool, Fulham and England midfielder has taken his chance superbly. His comments and quips in the classic Belgium-USA game were class. And the way he constantly berated Fellaini bordered on comic genius.

But I hope he doesn’t pursue a career in broadcasting because, given his insight into the game, he should go into coaching. I have spent time in his company and his knowledge and willingness to cut through the b******* is impressive. Murphy seems to have all the credentials to become a top manager.World Cup Bet:Coral’s are offering 7-2 for both Lionel Messi and Robin Van Persie to score within 90 minutes.
