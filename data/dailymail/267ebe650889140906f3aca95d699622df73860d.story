For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. 

In A Man Walks On To a Pitch, Redknapp reveals how close he came to signing Patrick Vieira and Luis Suarez during his time as Tottenham manager. 

Despite all that has happened in his career since, one of the biggest regrets of my life in management is not taking Luis Suarez to Tottenham when we had the chance. 

‘You’ve got to take him, Harry,’ Ruud Gullit told me. ‘He’s fantastic.’

Yet all of our scouts’ reports said that at Ajax he played wide off a striker, whereas we were looking for a proper front man. 

Just when I was on the verge of taking the plunge, the price went up. In the end he was sold for £22.8million to Liverpool. We wouldn’t have paid that.

Patrick Vieira was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now. He almost came to me at Tottenham from Inter Milan.

I thought it was an incredible decision by him, after he’d been such a hero at Arsenal.

I met him at his house in Hampstead and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get. He had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away.

I remember talking to Daniel Levy, our chairman, about him. He said the crowd would be hostile. I knew that — but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before, I thought it said something about the man.

In the end, his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in Italy. By the time he did become available — the following January — our needs had changed and Manchester City snapped him up.

Patrick is the player Arsenal have never really replaced, but I still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at Manchester City. Shouldn’t he be at Arsenal?

It is ironic that so many associate Arsene Wenger with the beautiful game, yet his Arsenal teams, with Vieira — the ultimate box-to-box midfielder — did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern Premier League.

Teams got bigger to compete with Arsenal because they were so strong. They were up there with any of the great post-War teams — the Busby Babes, Tottenham’s Double-winners, Revie’s Leeds United, the great Liverpool teams, Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson — they deserve to be mentioned with any of them.
