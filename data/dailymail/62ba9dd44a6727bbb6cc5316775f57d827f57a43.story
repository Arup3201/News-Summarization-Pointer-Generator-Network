One of the original Marlboro Men, who epitomized a rugged cowboy in the cigarette adverts, has died aged 85.

Darrell Winfield passed away from an unspecified 'lengthy illness' at his ranch in Riverton, Wyoming, while in hospice care.

The real-life rancher was working on a cattle farm in 1968 when he was first discovered by the Leo Burnett advertising agency and transformed into a world-recognized model.

Rugged looks: Darrell Hugh Winfield passed away from an unspecified 'lengthy illness' at his home in Riverton, Wyoming, while in hospice care - he played the iconic Marlboro Man for more than two decades

His rugged good looks scored him a contract as the face of Marlboro for more than two decades.

In a 1986 interview, Winfield described the lucky break as 'life-changing'. 

The Malboro Man character - used from 1954 to 1999 in magazine, television and billboard adverts - was portrayed in a natural setting with only a cigarette.

It was initially conceived by Leo Burnett as a way to popularize filtered cigarettes, which at the time were considered a feminine commodity.

Winfield said that he wore his own clothes for shoots and never wore make-up.

The Oklahoma native was one of the last Marlboro Men alive. Some were authentic cowboys like him while others were actors.

Other ex-faces of the tobacco brand include David Millar, who died of emphysema in 1987, and David McLean, who died of lung cancer in 1995.

Another who pushed the product, Wayne McLaren, died before his 52nd birthday in 1992 and Dick Hammer - better known for his role as Captain Hammer in the TV show Emergency! - passed away from lung cancer in 1999, aged 69.

Family man: Winfield is survived by his wife of 67 years, son, five daughters and several grandchildren

Eric Lawson who played the iconic cigarette-puffing cowboy during the late 1970s passed away aged 72 from respiratory failure last January. 

The Marlboro Man was scrapped in the late Nighties, when state governments banned the use of humans or cartoons in U.S. tobacco advertisements.

Winfield was born on July 30, 1929, in Little Kansas, Oklahoma. 

He is survived by his wife of 67 years, son, five daughters and several grandchildren.

A memorial service is being planned at a future date.
