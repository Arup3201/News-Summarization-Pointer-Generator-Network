Burnley boss Sean Dyche has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson is helping him adapt to the demands of Premier League management.

Ferguson singled out Dyche for praise in an interview he gave to United’s in-house television station earlier this week, saying: ‘He phoned me not so long ago. I think he is one of the promising managers in the game. The job he has done at Burnley has been fantastic.’

Dyche, who has known Ferguson’s son Darren since his playing days, admitted that he has been speaking to the former Old Trafford boss ‘on and off for a few years’ but was happy to keep it confidential.

The 43-year-old has yet to win a game in the Premier League since leading Burnley to promotion last season, but hopes that Fergie’s input can make a difference.

And he said: ‘There are a number of people I speak to and he is one of them. He is obviously a very important figure and always gives you really good, honest, helpful advice – no holds barred reality as he sees it, and he has been very good to me like that.

‘The last time I spoke to him, I said: “Can you win me a game now!”.

'More or less whenever I’ve needed it he has answered the call. He has always got time for you. He was like that when he was active as well, not just because he has retired. When he was manager he always took a phone call and always gave you sound advice.

‘He has experienced virtually everything in the football world and I ask him advice and pick his brains. It’s great that he thinks that I talk a bit of sense and try and get the best out of what we have.

'He had to do that himself many moons ago. It wasn’t an easy pathway and I don’t think there is one in football management to be honest.

‘There are certain people in the game you gravitate towards for an opinion. I am aware that you need that and he is one of them and he has been very helpful for me and honest with any view I have asked him about.

‘Sometimes I touch on many different challenges. As you can imagine he doesn’t beat about the bush.

‘I also speak to Darren. Me and Darren get on well and have done for a number of years. He almost signed for Nottingham Forest as a kid when I was there so we have known each other for a long time.’

Dyche is still adapting to life as a Premier League manager. Only this week, a photo was posted online of him travelling on the Tube to the Leaders In Sport Business summit at Stamford Bridge.

He added: ‘I was on the Tube and a young man said hello. I could see him and I just laughed, although the grimace picture looks more me. I was aware of him. I’m just a bloke you know but it was one of those funny little quirks.

‘There is a big profile difference, of course. It was slightly building last year because of what we did and all the players have noticed it.

‘At the golf club where I live, it’s amazing the people who say ‘hello Sean’. But I’m the same fella they have seen there for eight or nine years’.
