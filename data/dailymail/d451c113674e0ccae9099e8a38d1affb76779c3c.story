A sheep born from a frozen embryo that was preserved in a bid to save a rare British breed at the height of the foot-and-mouth crisis over a decade ago has produced her own set of twins.

Maggie, a rare Herdwick sheep, was born in Cumbria in April 2011 from an embryo that had been saved during the foot-and-mouth crisis 12 years ago.

And now, two years on from Maggie's astounding birth, the next generation have arrived as Maggie gave birth her own little duo in April this year.

The adorable twin lambs are carrying on the incredible work which was set in motion in 2001 in a desperate attempt to preserve the rare Herdwick breed.

The devastating epidemic that summer prompted Cumbrian farmers to find a way to safeguard the commercially-important breed's future.

Prof Dianna Bowles worked with the farmers and set up the Sheep Trust during the crisis, which came up with the idea to freeze embryos.

Prof Bowles told how Maggie suddenly became ill in October last year. Her owner, Margaret Hall, asked the Sheep Trust to look after her and she quickly became pregnant the following month.

Prof Bowles, 65, a lecturer at York University and founder and chair of the Sheep Trust, said it was all thanks to science that Maggie has given birth to her own young.

'This just goes to show that science is evolving everyday and to think this would happen 12 years after the height of the foot-and-mouth epidemic is astronomical,' she said.

Maggie was born and raised with the help of schoolgirl Evie Church, now 15, who was integral in rearing and looking after the ewe.

Evie vowed to help fight FMD on her dad's farm in the tiny village of Lofthouse in the Yorkshire Dales after her father told her terrible stories of affected animals being culled.

Evie then passed the ewe onto her new owner Mrs Hall, who put her back into her flock.

Prof Bowles said: 'We passed Maggie back to her owner Margaret around five months after she was born, and basically said 'Here are your embryos', and she put Maggie back in her flock as normal.

'She was doing amazingly well, but suddenly Maggie, along with another ewe, became ill and we were asked to take them back.

'Weeks later, Maggie and the other ewe became pregnant, but we didn't know if they would both make it through.

'However, thanks to the fantastic work by the Sheep Trust, Maggie and the other ewe each now have twins.

'Maggie's little ones are beautiful, just like their mother. They haven't got a name yet, but they're so precious.

'We're finding that science can help agriculture more and more as technologies get better and better, and research can only improve after this.'

The Herdwicks are one of the most commercially important breeds, and a staggering 20,000 were culled at the height of foot-and-mouth, leading to the fears the breed could become extinct.

Prof Bowles, of Harrogate, North Yorks., who has her own flock of Herdwicks, was approached by Cumbrian farmers at the height of the foot-and-mouth epidemic who asked her to use her science to help their sheep breeds threatened by the disease.

'The foot-and-mouth crisis was horrendous for everyone in the farming industry,' she said.

'I set up the Sheep Trust at the height of the epidemic, and after I was approached by the farmers to help I thought 'Why not'. After that I have really become attached to them.

'Now I'm trying to get some top class scientists and farmers into the same room to discuss how technology can improve farming, and vice versa.

'The biggest possibility is speeding up breeding, whether it be plant or livestock breeding. The science is now there that you can possibly speed up the whole process of 10-15 years to just two to three years.

'It's an exciting time for farming and science, and Maggie's twins are a prime example of just how vital science is to the farming world.'
