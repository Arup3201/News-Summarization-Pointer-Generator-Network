A £3.25million seafront home belonging to a former neighbour of football manager Harry Redknapp has been destroyed in a fire, killing its owner.

Graham Cox, 77, died when the first floor of his home on an exclusive street in Poole, Dorset, was engulfed in flame on Wednesday afternoon. 

Firefighters battled the flames for several hours but could not save Mr Cox, a retired businessman.

Burnt out: The luxurious seafront property in Poole, Dorset, was destroyed in a fire on Wednesday. Harry Redknapp used to live in the grey-roofed house to the left

Killed: Graham Cox, 77, who owned the £3.25million home, was killed in the fire

Rescuers had to wait 24 hours to retrieve his body after the four-bedroom house was left unstable by the blaze.

Contractors working nearby had raised the alarm after spotting plumes of white smoke billowing from the roof of the property.

The house, which was in need of modernising, was valued at £3.25million because of its sought-after location by Poole harbour.

The property is just next to a home which used to be owned by Mr Redknapp, before he moved even further upmarket to the millionaire's Sandbank's estate just across the water. 

Investigation: Dorset Fire and Rescue have launched a probe into the causes of the fire

Battle: As many as 40 firefighters took on the blaze, and needed to wait 24 hours before entering the unstable house to retrieve Mr Cox's body

Outside: The entrance to the burned-out home can be seen to the left - and Mr Redknapp's old gates to the right

Mr Cox and his wife Elaine, 71, had lived at the house for 33 years. It is thought Mrs Cox was not at the property at the time of the fire.

Mr Redknapp and his wife Sandra lived in the luxury property next-door while the soccer boss was in charge of south coast side Portsmouth.

Mr Redknapp sold his house for £2.9million  in 2006 and moved to Sandbanks, which has been described as the world's fourth most expensive location after Tokyo, Hong Kong and London's Belgravia.

Dorset Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the fire.

Relatives of Mr Cox, who is believed to have been unwell when the fire struck, paid tribute to him.

In a message posted online, his niece Charlotte said: 'I would like to commend everyone that was involved in the rescue of my uncle in this tragic awful event that will scar my family forever.

'I would like to thank others for their kind words. He was an incredibly hard working man from a very hard working background and this loss will never go away.

'Thank you again to all that risked their lives to help in this truly sad sad accident.'

The blaze destroyed the first floor and roof space of the large detached home that may now have to be demolished.

Inspector Ian Jarred, from Dorset police, confirmed they were not treating Mr Cox’s death as suspicious.
