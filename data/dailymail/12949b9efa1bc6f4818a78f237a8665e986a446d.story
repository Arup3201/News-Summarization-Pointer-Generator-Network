Row: Take That singer Howard Donald has angered neighbours with work on his expensive home

Neighbours of Take That singer Howard Donald say they have been condemned to 'months of noise' after the pop star asked builders to dig an extra floor under his £4.4million London home.

Builders are reportedly making space for a nanny's quarters and a playroom for the singer's two daughters in his four-storey townhouse in Kensington.

It is believed the work, which involves digging more than three metres beneath the property, will cost about £250,000.

One neighbour told the Evening Standard: 'We predicted this would cause a lot of trouble and we were right. We’ve been condemned to months of noise and inconvenience.

'This is supposed to be a family area but normal family life is being ruined by this fashion for basement excavations.'

Another nearby resident said: 'Construction like this is a cause of long-standing gripes among neighbours. There are always works going on around here.'

Complaints of noise, vibration and dust are commonly made in relation to basement projects, which can take more than a year to complete.

Two residents' groups, the Kensington
Society and the Earl's Court Society, objected to the work when Mr 
Donald, 44, sought planning permission, but the plans were approved in 
2009.

The
singer bought the house for £3.4million the previous year, and its 
value is estimated to have risen by about £1million since then.

A spokesman for Mr Donald told the newspaper that the singer was 'doing his utmost' to minimise the impact on neighbours.

Contractors working on the project include a project manager, quantity surveyor, architect and structural engineer.
