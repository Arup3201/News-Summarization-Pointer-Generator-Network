Chuck Cox, the father of missing Utah mother Susan Powell, said today that the child pornography charges filed against her father-in-law make it clear he is a liar.

Steven Powell, 61, was arrested yesterday after police discovered thousands of images of women and young girls videotaped without their knowledge, including some of his daughter-in-law.

Mr Cox said the discovery categorically shows that Powell's claims the 28-year-old mother of two was 'very sexual' with him were lies.

'I do think it vindicates my 
daughter, and what we've said about her and it clearly shows that he had
motive to detract from her reputation,' Mr Cox said on Good Morning 
America.

Susan's husband, Josh, is the lone 
person of interest in the woman's December 2009 disappearance, and the 
case has created a bitter rift between the two families, with a custody 
battle for the couple's two sons raging.

It was announced today that the boys, ages four and six, are in foster care after Powell was arraigned child porn and voyeurism charges on Friday. He entered a plea of not guilty.

The children had been living at their paternal grandfather's home with their father since their mother vanished.

Court battle: Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, filed for custody of her kids on Friday

Powell was arrested after 
police investigating Susan Powell's disappearance came across thousands 
of images of women videotaped without their knowledge, including some of
his daughter-in-law.

Wearing an orange jailhouse jumpsuit 
and with his hands cuffed he entered not guilty pleas in court in 
Washington state on Friday, and the judge set bail at $200,000.

The judge at Powell's arraignment ordered him not to have contact with his grandsons.

A court commissioner said on Friday 
that he will not decide on the custody of the sons until after the 
state's child welfare agency finishes its investigation. Another hearing
is scheduled for Wednesday.

Mr Cox said after the hearing: 'We're very concerned for the welfare of our grandchildren. We're doing everything we can.'

The arrest - and the child custody 
motion - are the latest twists in a case that has perplexed Utah police,
who are on their 12th day of searching a remote stretch of desert near 
where Josh Powell says he went camping the night his wife vanished.

Prosecutor Mark Lindquist in 
Washington state said Steven Powell is charged with 14 felony counts of 
voyeurism and one count of possession of child pornography.

Lindquist said Utah police 
investigating Susan Powell's disappearance found 'thousands of images of
females being videotaped without their knowledge, including Susan 
Powell,' on tapes and disks at his home in an August 25 search.

Accused: Steven Powell, 61, was arrested last night at his Washington home on child porn and voyeurism charges after thousands of images were found

The videos were found in Steven 
Powell's bedroom. Lindquist said in a statement: 'The photographer 
focuses on the women's buttocks, breasts. Many images were of minor 
females.'

The images included shots of two girls
who were as young as eight and ten years old at the time, the 
prosecutor said. Authorities determined that the girls lived near Steven
Powell from June 2006 to August 2007.

At Powell's arraignment, prosecutor 
Grant Blinn said detectives are still going through the seized items, 
but so far have found more than 1,000 video files. He said it appeared 
he had been secretly videotaping girls or women for at least ten years.

The arrest prompted a Cox family 
lawyer to directly accuse Josh - for the first time publicly - of 
involvement in his wife's disappearance.

Missing: Susan Powell, 28 and a mother of two, has not been seen since 2009. Her arrested father-in-law Steven said he had a 'sexual relationship' with her

'The time has come where we have to 
stop playing cat and mouse games: Josh Powell had something to do with 
the disappearance of the mother of these children,' attorney Steve 
Downing told the court commissioner on Friday.

Powell responded: 'Everything they said is patently false. I am a good father to my sons.'

Before the hearing, he sat in the back
row of the small courtroom wearing a blue jacket, jeans, white sneakers
with the treads worn off - and his wedding ring.

Powell flipped through a thick stack 
of legal documents and told a reporter 'no' when asked if he had 
anything to say about his dad's arrest. He ignored several other 
questions.

Susan Powell's father called the 
allegations against Steven Powell disgusting. 'It very clearly shows her
concerns were just about Steven Powell,' Chuck Cox said.

Police have said Josh Powell has been uncooperative in their investigation.

Josh Powell claims he took the 
couple's two sons - then ages four and two - on a midnight camping trip 
in the mountains west of Salt Lake City on December 6, 2009, the night 
before she was reported missing.

Also on Friday, a Washington state judge 
issued a permanent injunction barring Josh Powell and his father from 
further publishing journal pages Susan Powell wrote as a teenager.

Raised eyebrows: Steven Powell went on record last month to say Susan was promiscuous and used to make him smell her hair

The Powells claimed the journal 
entries depicted a troubled woman, but Susan's family has been fighting 
their release, saying they were the personal writings of a young girl 
and had no bearing on her disappearance.

Authorities planned to wrap up their 
12-day search of the desert Friday about 30 miles from where Josh Powell
said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a 
'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot.

But they found no human remains. Charred wood chips discovered in the hole have been sent to a lab for testing.

The search of the Powells home in 
Puyallup, Washington, last month came after police wrapped up a search 
for evidence in a network of abandoned mines outside Ely, Nevada.

Husband: Josh Powell, Susan's husband and Steven's son, is still the only person of interest in his wife's missing persons case

Around that time in August, Josh 
Powell and his father went on national television to discuss the case. 
They claimed Susan Powell was promiscuous, emotionally unstable and 
suicidal, a claim her family denies.

Steven Powell said he had a flirtatious relationship with his daughter-in-law and believed they were in love.

'Susan was very sexual with me,' Steve
Powell told ABC's Good Morning America. 'We interacted in a lot of 
sexual ways because Susan enjoys doing that.'

Cox, Susan's father, denied the allegations, and said it was Steven Powell who initiated unwanted sexual advances.

Search: Investigators found a shallow grave while searching a site in the desert earlier this month

Josh Powell has denied killing his 
wife or having anything to do with her disappearance. 'I would never 
even hurt her,' a tearful, red-eyed Josh Powell told CBS' Early Show in 
August.

Josh and his father have said they believe Susan Powell ran off with another man.

'I'm still thinking she left,' Steven 
Powell told The Associated Press in August. 'Hopefully they'll be able 
to find her at some point... We don't believe she's dead.'
