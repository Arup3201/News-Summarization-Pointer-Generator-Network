This 13-year-old kid may be a Little League player, but there is nothing diminutive about him.

Erick Figueroa, who plays for Puerto Rico, stands at an insane 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 240 pounds.

That makes the right-handed pitcher about the size of Rex Sox hitter David Ortiz, of the Boston Red Sox, who is known as 'Big Papi' in part due to his 6-foot-4 and 239 pounds.

At 6-foot-4, Erick Figueroa stands like a giant next to some of the other average-sized players

Erick Figueroa, 230 pounds, is about the same size as Boston Red Sox hitter David Ortiz, whose size earned him the nickname 'Big Papi'

One of Figueroa's main attributes is his 'intimidating mound presence,' according to Baseball Factory's scouting report.

His main disadvantage: 'large target.'

Figueroa says that getting to the Little League World Series is a 'dream come true.'

'I have no doubt that we will win because we have sacrificed a lot,' he told Primera Hora, in Spanish, about his prediction for their opening game against Australia.

He led his Caribbean team to a 16-3 win against the Aussies in four innings on Thursday.

Figueroa remains confident about his team's chances in the Little League Baseball World Series.

'We are well prepared and will do well,' he added.
