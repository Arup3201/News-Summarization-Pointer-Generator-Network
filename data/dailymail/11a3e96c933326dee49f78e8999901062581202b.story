Charged: Jerry Sandusky was charged with 40 counts relating to sexual abuse of minors

The child sex abuse scandal surrounding the actions of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky continues to grow as details about his family life come to light.

Additionally, the governor of Pennsylvania is adding fuel to the fire, speculating Sunday that more victims will be added to the list of eight boys who were allegedly sexually violated by Sandusky.

When he retired from his defensive coaching position at Penn State, Sandusky cited his need to more family time and dedication to his charity The Second Mile, which helped underprivileged children who were living in foster homes. 

He and his wife Dorothy raised six 
children, all of whom were adopted, and one of whom tried to kill 
himself shortly after moving in with the Sanduskys.

The first recorded time that Jerry 
Sandusky's behavior was called into question dates back to his son 
Matt's suicide attempt in 1995.

Matt, now 32, came into the Sandusky home through The Second Mile, after having a troubled childhood.

Even after getting involved with the 
charity, Matt ran into legal trouble at the age of 16 when he burned down a barn and 
was taken in as a foster child by the coach and his wife for two years 
before being legally adopted by the couple.

Shortly after he moved into the house, however, Matt tried to kill himself, prompting some raised alarms.

His probation officer became 
concerned about his well being and wrote letters to a judge saying that 
she was concerned about Matt's 'safety and his current progress'.

The probation officer, Terry Trude, 
said that she had spoken with Matt's biological mother Debra Long who 
was also worried about Matt, hoping that his living situation would be 
reviewed by the court. 

Local Pennsylvania newspaper The 
Patriot-News released the court records of Matt Sandusky's adoption, 
including a letter that he wrote to the court imploring the judge to 
allow him to stay with the family.

'I would like to be placed back with 
the Sanduskys. I feel that they have supported me even when I have 
messed up. They are a loving caring group of people. I love both my 
biological family and the Sandusky family,' he wrote at the time.

Matt has been unflinching in his 
support of the family, singing their praises to a sports Illustrated 
reporter when Jerry Sandusky left Penn State in 1999.

'My life changed when I came to live here,' says Matt.

'There were rules, there was 
discipline, there was caring. Dad put me on a workout program. He gave 
me someone to talk to, a father figure I never had. I have no idea where
 I'd be without him and Mom. I don't even want to think about it. And 
they've helped so many kids besides me,' he continued.

Matt is still extremely close with 
his family, and that hasn't seemed to change since the news of the 
scandal, much to his ex-wife's chagrin.

Matt's ex-wife Jill Jones is fearful 
for the couple's three children in light of the allegations of Jerry 
Sandusky's sexual abuse, and got a court order to prevent their two daughters and one son from spending any alone time with their grandfather.

The order was issued during the week 
of the scandal, but that didn't stop Matt from bringing his daughters, 
aged nine and seven years old, and their five year old son from visiting the alleged pedophile.

Angered: Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett said Sunday that while they fulfilled their legal obligation, the coaches that knew of the abuse did not fulfil their moral one

Court records show that Matt took the three children to visit their grandparents on November 5, the day that the charges were announced.

In an effort to lessen her concern, Jerry's wife Dorothy called her former daughter in law to tell her that the children would be safe in the house. The call didn't change Jill's mind, however, and she still asked for the court order, which prevents the children from staying overnight in their grandparent's house.

There is no evidence to believe that Sandusky ever abused his grandchildren, but the documents say that there is a 'fundamental disagreement over the validity of the charges against Jerry Sandusky and the risk he poses to children'.

The case continues to gain momentum as speculation grows that there will be more names added to the list of eight victims.

Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett said Sunday that in addition to the illegal acts of Jerry Sandusky, coaches Joe Paterno and Mike McQueary were guilty of not fulfilling their moral obligation.

'When the word gets out, when people understand that authorities are actually doing something about this, that they may be believed, then more people come forward,' Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett said Sunday.

'As governor, I have a requirement to make sure that we protect the children of Pennsylvania,' Mr Corbett continued.

'In my opinion, when you don't follow through, when you don't continue on to make sure that actions are taken, then I lose confidence in your ability to lead. That would be the case here,' he continued.

'I've always have said, your actions speak louder than your words. That should not have been able to continue. The actions or the failure to act while maybe not criminal, caused me not to have confidence in the president and in the coach.'
