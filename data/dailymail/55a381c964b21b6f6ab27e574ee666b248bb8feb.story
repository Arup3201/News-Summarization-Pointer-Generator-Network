Paul Lambert has confirmed that a late night call from Tom Cleverley was the spark that got his deadline day move from Manchester United to Aston Villa over the line.

The Villa manager praised the England international for making clear his desire to move to the Midlands and get back to playing regular football after being deemed surplus to requirements by Louis Van Gaal.

A £7million transfer had appeared set with Cleverley on route to a medical before turning round amid interest from Everton. Villa were particularly aggravated by the conduct of Cleverley’s agent Simon Kennedy and Lambert believed he had missed out on the player.

Only when the 25-year-old made a last ditch plea to the Scot did the deal get resurrected. He joined on a loan with a permanent option in January.

‘He phoned and I spoke to him which was totally fine,’ said Lambert. ‘My main concern was that he wanted to come here, he wanted to play.

‘I know all this speculation about him not wanting to come, that’s not the impression when I spoke to him.

‘The deadline day is mayhem, things can go wrong, be on and off, carnage breaking out everywhere. I knew the situation.

‘Turning back up to Manchester, that’s fine, that’s how football works, then all of a sudden its back on. The lad never indicated he didn’t want to come. I spoke to him, he was professional about it.'

Lambert added: ‘He’s at a really good age, great energy to play the game, he’s got a goal in him. The first week he’s trained with us, he’s been really comfortable. If he can do what I think he can do we’ve got a really top player on our hands.

‘This is definitely my strongest squad in my time here. No doubt about that. We’re playing really well and with lots of confidence.’
