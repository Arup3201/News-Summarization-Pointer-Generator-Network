Jealous Edith Wiredu threw boiling water over her friend

A devout Christian who driven by jealousy threw boiling water over the love rival she believed bedded her boyfriend has been jailed for five years.

Edith Wiredu, 21, from Canterbury, told Terena Omoetuk, 20, they needed to 'talk' amid rumours the design student was sleeping with the lover from whom she had just split - but still cared for.

Canterbury Crown Court heard that when Terena denied the allegations church-going mother-of-one Wiredu, also a student, hurled the scalding water over her.

Terena was rushed to hospital with burns to a quarter of her body and has been left with scars across her chest and neck.

Jailing Wiredu, Judge Edward Connell said: 'This was a wicked and nasty offence and you should count it very lucky the injuries werenâ€™t more serious.

'This was a wholly deliberate act committed in anger and designed to injure your victim.

'This is a particularly tragic case because you have made remarkable progress in your education.

However, a probation report on Wiredu, claimed she had shown no remorse for the attack in November last year.

The incident happened after Wiredu confronted her friend about allegations that she had been cheating with her boyfriend.

She then walked into the kitchen area of their house, picked up a bowl of boiling water and threw it over her.

Miss Umoetuk told how she and fellow students had met and had been planning to attend a meeting of the university's Afro-Caribbean Society.

Instead, Wiredu quizzed her friend about having sex with her boyfriend Tinashe.

Ms Umoetuk told the jury: 'I said: 'No'. I was shocked and confused. She asked me again and I denied it again.

'She then started getting angry and said that I had to start telling her the truth because he had told her. But I denied it again.

'She then left and went into the living room. I followed her and as I walked in, Edith appeared with a bowl of hot liquid and threw it over me. It went over my face and chest.'

She then claimed that as she fell to the floor, Wiredu grabbed her hair and tried to stamp on her head.

Wiredu, who was studying tourism, and has a three-year-old child, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. But she was convicted unanimously by a jury.

Philip Rowley, defending, said: 'Clearly Miss Wiredu did not articulate correctly her feelings to the probation officer and she was surprised to read that she viewed herself as a victim, too.

'She wants it said that she does not view herself in that role and accepts the victim suffered deeply unpleasant injuries which will last a long time. She accepts her responsibility.'
