Police officers could be brought in to help alleviate a chronic nurse shortage amid proposals being presented to a Scottish health board.

NHS Grampian warned in April of a massive lack of staff at Aberdeen’s Royal Cornhill Hospital.

Now, it has emerged a local forum has discussed the possibility of drafting in assistance from Police Scotland and the Red Cross.

Two months ago it was announced that 30 nursing posts had to be filled as soon as possible at the hospital.

Aberdeen's Royal Cornhill Hospital has such a severe shortage of nurses that it is considering bringing in police officers or Red Cross volunteers to alleviate the problem

However, nine positions are still available and staff are still being forced to handle issues they are not trained to deal with.

At a meeting of the Grampian Area Partnership Forum in March, contingency planning within the health board’s mental heal service was discussed.

And a reference was made at looking at ‘third sector’ for assistance with ‘back-up’.

The minutes from the meeting will go before NHS Grampian tomorrow.

But critics have hit out at the idea, claiming that using police staff or Red Cross volunteers was ‘scandalous’.

Scottish Patients Association chairwoman, Margaret Watt said: ‘I’ve never heard of such a cock-eyed idea in my entire life.

‘The purpose of the police is not to help out in hospitals - they do not have the training to look after the patients in our hospitals.

‘You also have to ask how qualified the Red Cross are. They might be better trained than police, but not nurses.’

While Red Cross volunteers and police staff have not been contacted, North East Labour MSP Richard Baker said the move would be a ‘national scandal’.

He said: ‘It seems to be a very extreme situation to have to resort to police staff for care and treatment at the facility.

‘I’ve never heard of a situation like this one right across the whole of Scotland.

‘Having to resort to bringing in police and the Red Cross to keep the hospital going would be a national scandal.

‘It raises questions about how resources are being managed at NHS Grampian - but it also raises questions about Health Secretary Alex Neil.’

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ‘Under the SNP, NHS Grampian’s budget is at record levels and has received a 4.2 per cent increase in funding in this financial year.

‘That increase comes in contrast to Labour’s own admission that they wouldn’t ring-fence the health budget, and despite Westminster slashing Scotland’s overall budget.

‘We expect health boards to have the right staff in place to deliver a first-class service to patients and welcome the new appointments made at Royal Cornhill and that further recruitment is planned.

‘The new workforce planning tool, which became compulsory on April 1, will ensure that hospitals have the right number of people and the right skills mix in place in order to deal with the demands placed upon them.’

NHS Grampian admitted that staffing issues are ‘challenging’, however they added that the situation is improving.

An NHS spokeswoman said: ‘The staffing position, whilst challenging, continues to improve.

‘Following a national advertising campaign another 11 registered nurses have been appointed.

‘Another round of interviews will take place in July.’

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ‘Unless NHS Grampian actually get in touch with us we have no comment to make.’
