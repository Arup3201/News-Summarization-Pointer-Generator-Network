Michael Gove shocked a Cabinet summit with the woman in charge of attracting more internet tycoons to London, by claiming they are flocking to the capital to have ‘hot sex’.

He said the city was attracting young businessmen and women from all over the world because they believed there were ‘more opportunities for success and sex’.

The Education Secretary’s boast shocked former Facebook and Google executive Joanna Shields, 51, boss of David Cameron’s Tech City task force.

Only Berlin comes close! Gove said some very frank views had been expressed to him by young entrepreneurs

Embarrassed Mr Cameron, who chaired the meeting in his Commons office, spluttered: ‘Make sure that does not appear in the minutes.’ Home Secretary Theresa May, who was also present, gasped.

Mr Gove’s extraordinary comment came after US-born Ms Shields made a presentation on Government measures needed to bring young entrepreneurs to London to launch new high-tech industries.

Mr Gove said: ‘We are increasing computer science lessons in school, but there are some things the Government cannot do.

'I was talking to some young entrepreneurs recently and they said the reason they love London so much is not so much high-tech opportunities but that it’s a fantastic city with great opportunities to be successful, enjoy a great culture, have a good time and loads of hot sex. Only Berlin comes close!’

Shock: Former Facebook, Google and Bebo executive Joanna Shields was at the summit

He explained the ‘hot sex’ claim had been made to him by entrepreneurs in the Founders Forum, a glamourous international organisation which claims to promote ‘the world’s brightest and most dynamic digital entrepreneurs’.

It has organised events involving businessmen such as Sir Richard Branson and The Voice TV talent show panellist, singer and philanthropist,  Will.i.am. Prince Andrew hosted a dinner for Founders Forum at Windsor Castle last year and Mr Cameron attended one of its events in California.

An eyewitness said: ‘It was a jaw-dropping moment. Ms Shields looked as surprised as the rest of us and, after a pause, smiled broadly. One of two people giggled. Michael was unabashed and said casually, “I thought everyone knew that.” ’

Other Ministers at the event included Chancellor George Osborne, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin.

It is not the first sign that Mr Gove is shrugging off his previous strait-laced image. Increasingly, he is seen as a rival future leader to Boris Johnson.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how a ‘tipsy’ Mr Gove called Mr Johnson ‘unfit’ to run Britain at a private dinner party.

And he told this newspaper two weeks ago that he was a fan of ‘chap hop’ rapper Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer, who sings about sex and drugs.
