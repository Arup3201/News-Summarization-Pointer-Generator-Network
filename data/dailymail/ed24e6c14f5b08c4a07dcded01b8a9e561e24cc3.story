Days of luxury over: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi seen sitting in a plane in Zintan after his capture

A woman claiming to be the ex-wife of Colonel Gaddafi's captured son Saif al-Islam has emerged in Ukraine with extraordinary stories alleging domestic violence and womanising.

Nadia, a blue-eyed brunette claims to have met him when she worked as a stripper in a top Moscow nightclub, and says she is currently in hiding, fearing for her life.

She claimed that as she prepared for marriage to Saif, she had to fly to Paris to have an operation to 'restore' her virginity. '

'The doctor proved my innocence in the presence of Saif's aunt. Then I embraced Islam,' she added.

'I
tried to have a normal family, but Saif wanted to live as a single man 
with lovers and orgies,' she said in a Ukrainian newspaper interview.

While
there is no proof of her claim of have married and divorced Saif after 
two years, her claim appears to be taken seriously in Russia and 
Ukraine.

If she is who she 
says, she could be a key witness at his trial whether it is in Libya or 
under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

One
aspect of his trial is likely to be his alleged friendship with a 
number of prominent British figures, including Prince Andrew, Tony Blair
and Lord Mandelson.

'Our house looked like more as bordello: a lot of his friends and a lot of women,' she said.

'We got married under religious traditions, I embraced Islam for that, but nobody treated me as the mistress of the house.

'There was no respect at all. My husband tried to make me a submissive Eastern woman, and I couldn't stand that attitude.

'That broke me, ate me from inside. And 
what's more important, Saif took drugs and he couldn't control himself 
when he was under narcotics.

'He had certain sexual perversions 
in sex, for example, he liked to do it in public. I understood that we 
couldn't live together.'

Nadia,
who is believed to be 29, claimed that their relationship ended after a
furious row in a restaurant which culminated with him beating her and 
throwing her out of a window but she miraculously survived.

She claimed she was in a coma for 47 
days, and that Gaddafi - who acknowledged her but never started a 
conversation with her - was outraged by his son's behaviour.

Gaddafi was known to have employed 
Ukrainian nurses in his medical team, but until now it was not known his
second son has a wife from the former Soviet country.

Of
Gaddafi himself she said: 'About me being in hospital, he was in a 
fury. He kicked Saif away to the desert. It could spoil the reputation 
of the family that was already not so clean.'

She left Libya and returned to 
Moscow. 'The last time he came was in 2008, and he suggested that we 
lived together again ~ but I was cold to him by that time.'

Nadia said she was working in Moscow until 2010 but a mutual friend then told her to disappear or she could face danger.

She claimed that Saif could not have replaced his father. 'He was afraid of his father, as of fire. And Gaddafi, I think, despised him for internal weaknesses.'

Playboy Saif loved luxury and money. She said: 'He was cheating on me all the time.'

Nadia
- it is not known if this is her real name - is apparently in hiding in
the Crimea where she says she is fearful of his enemies. 'I don't know 
any secrets, but still I'm scared,' she said.

She claims not to be rich but for Saif 'it was all in a day's work to spend $20,000 (USD) at a restaurant.

'When we separated I had only 
luxurious earrings which I managed to sell for $1million. I lived in 
Moscow on this money. Now almost nothing is left.'

Her most recent interview was with Ukrainian paper Respubika. It was made shortly before his capture.

'I thought Saif would turn my life into an Eastern fairytale,' she said. 'It didn't work.'
