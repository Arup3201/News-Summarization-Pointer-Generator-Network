Two Houston thieves who failed to understand how the Cloud works are being hunted by cops after pictures they took of themselves on a victim's iPad were backed up online.

Holding two fans of $100 bills, the young men are suspects in the January 8 theft of Randy Schaefer's Apple tablet, his laptop, a radar detector and cash from his truck outside his home.

One week after the crime, Schaefer discovered pictures and a gloating video automatically uploaded to his iCloud account in which Dorian and his friend, Dylan, boast about their successful hustle.

Error: Dorian and Dylan were so excited with their haul last week that they took some selfies and video at their local Burger King. Unfortunately for them, they were also uploaded to the Cloud

According to the Smoking Gun, Dorian is a 20-year-old Houston man named Dorian Markee Walker-Gaines who has prior arrests in 2013 for marijuana possession and a 2014 arrest for tresspassing.

His 2014 arrest was for unlawfully entering a Houston woman's car, but the case against Dorian, who has the word 'Brilliant' tattoed across his chest, was dropped.

During the course of the incriminating Facebook video, which Dorian uploaded to his own Facebook account, he introduces Dylan as his brother.

Dorian has since deleted his Facebook account on the advice of friends after members of the media made the link between him and the theft.

Victim: Randy Schaefer and his girlfriend: Randy has turned over all the incriminating evidence over to the Houston Police Department

One of his friends wrote, 'Yo, deactivate yur page n****h yu hot.'

In the video, Dorian is heard to say, 'this, my good people, is what we get from a good night's hustle.'

His friend Dylan adds, 'No twenties, no fives, no tens.'

Houston Police Department have said the case is now under active investigation.
