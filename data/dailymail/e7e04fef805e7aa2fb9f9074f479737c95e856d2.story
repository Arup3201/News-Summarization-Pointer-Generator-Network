Charged: Eboni Tucker-Smith, 32, has been arrested after her children were found in filthy conditions

A mother has been charged with neglect after police found her six children living in a filthy, roach-infested home without power or running water.

Eboni Tucker-Smith, 32, was charged on Tuesday, several days after her partner DaQuan Smith, 35, and mother, Delthy Graham, 50, were also charged with child neglect in the incident.

Officers found the  'deplorable conditions' at the Ocoee, Florida home on January 22 as they served a warrant after energy companies reported that the family had thousands of dollars in outstanding fees.

At the home, officers found toilets filled with feces, trash piled up inside and outside the home, and dog feces throughout the house, according to the arrest affidavit, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

'There was old and current dog feces on the floors and beds of which appeared to be where the children slept,' according to the police.

'In two children's bedrooms the beds were old and dirty with mold and rust stains on them. I observed insects on top of the beds (roaches) and rotting food on the floors and the beds.'

A broken window in the bedroom had been used to throw trash into the backyard.

Police also observed that the refrigerator did not close all the way and was filled with roaches both dead and alive, and that there was a loaded handgun in the master bedroom.

Disgusting: Police found trash filling the yard and inside the house, as well as dog feces throughout the home, cockroaches and rodents, according to a report. The home also had no water or gas

Arrests: The children's grandmother Delthy Graham, 50, left, and dad DaQuan Smith, 35, were also charged

'The backyard of the home was filled with garbage bags, these bags had rotten food, roaches and I observed a rodent inside a fast food bag,' read the report.

The house had no running water or gas, and neighbors sent police photographs showing the children stealing their water by filling up bottles - as instructed by Tucker-Smith.

Police removed the six youngsters from the home and they were turned over to a family member. 

Authorities first learned about the sickening living conditions when Tucker-Smith was arrested in November for allegedly presenting a fraudulent document to lower her water bill at Ocoee City Hall.

She told police at the time that she didn't know if anyone would be taking care of her children while she was in jail, so police officers went to the house.

Inside, they found broken windows, overflowing toilets, insects and rodents, police said. 

The Department of Children and Families were called in but could not get inside the home. Tucker-Smith's mother said they were planning to leave the home - but they didn't.

After the failed visit from DCF and unpaid utility bills, the power was shut off, and police secured a search warrant earlier this month.

They found the home in the same conditions and that the family was squatting there, they said.
