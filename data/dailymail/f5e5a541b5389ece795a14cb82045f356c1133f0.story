Hitting the bullseye is typically the work of professional darts players and chance.

But even a novice could soon master the art as two brothers have created a small plastic loop that fits on the finger to help darts players perfect their throw.

Professor David Needham and his younger brother Stuart have created DartSight, a finger ring 'sighter' designed to help darts lovers hit 180s and the bullseye more often.

And the Oldham man's design is sure to be a hit with darts enthusiasts as they train.

The PHD Professor and director of the Centre for Single Particle Science and Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, created the device because of his passion for darts.

Prof Needham's business partner Stuart, also of Oldham, who teaches people to drive minibuses, said DartSight will improve players' accuracy.

The 55-year-old grandad-of-one said: 'David has used his scientific skills to develop DartSight.

DartSight is described as a: 'a serious attempt to help align your throw and develop a reliable and repeatable muscle memory for your action'

It works by showing you what you should see with your dominant eye

'The sighter is a small plastic device
 that fits on the player's finger and is lined up with the target on the
 dartboard in training.

'From the initial concept idea it took us 18 months to have a finished product.

'For pretty much the price of a pint, £3, you could develop a really good darts throw by practising with it.

'We've sold around 350 and more distributors are wanting to come on board.'

It is to be used only for practice and not for actual competing, as darts rules are so strict.

DartSight is described as a: 'serious attempt to help align your throw and develop a reliable and repeatable muscle memory for your action.'

It works by showing you what you should see with your dominant eye. When you line-up DartSight with your target, e.g., the bullseye, you can then throw your dart at the correct angle.

Father-of-one David splits his time between universities in North Carolina and Odense in Denmark.

The brothers are now working on a Greater Manchester Business Growth programme to develop future sales, marketing and product development strategies.

Prof Needham's brother added: 'At its most fundamental level, success at darts is about accuracy and consistency.

'DartSight is a training aid, not a gimmick and our trials show it works.

'It helps you put your hand in the same place every time so you can get your eye, hand and arm co-ordinated together to keep a level of consistency.

'We are not targeting professionals to begin with.

'It is aimed at the general player, or semi-pro, and the person who wants to develop accuracy.'

The product is available to buy at dartsight.com.

Played in international tournaments and in pubs around the world, darts is believed to have begun in medieval times, when soldiers would practise throwing missiles for fun and to maintain their shooting skills.

The rules begin with the law that a player shall throw darts from a standing position, excepting only in those circumstances when a physical disability, or physical injury requires a player to adopt a non-standing position.

A throw must consist of a maximum of ‘three darts’, unless a leg, set, or match is completed in less than ‘three darts’.

If a player ‘touches’ any dart, which is in the dartboard, during a throw, then that throw shall be deemed to have been completed.

Any dart bouncing off, or falling out of, the dartboard, does not count, and shall not be re-thrown.

The ‘Bull’ counts as ‘50’, and if ‘50’ is required to complete a leg, set, or match, then the ‘Bull’ shall count as a 'Double 25’.

Players aim to reach target scores of 501, 601, 701, 1001 or similar.
