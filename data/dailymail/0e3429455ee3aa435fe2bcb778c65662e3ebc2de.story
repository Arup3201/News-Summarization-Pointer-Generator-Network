A bride has spoken of her delight after she was walked down the aisle by her long-lost father - just weeks after meeting him for the first time since she was a baby.

Donna Molyneux, 34, had not seen her father Bill Sneddon since he and her mother Linda split-up when she was a baby in 1979.

Incredibly, despite not knowing what Bill looked like it, it took her just 10 minutes to track him down on Facebook after recognising her own likeness in one of his profile pictures.

Donna's dream came true as her father Bill Sneddon walked her down the aisle, having just recovered from an operation to remove a tumour

After making contact with him on the internet they agreed to meet for a reconciliation last July.

Heart-breakingly, just days after meeting for the first time, Bill was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was forced to undergo surgery to remove tumour.

Battling the illness, Bill managed to recover enough to be strong enough to fulfil his daughter's dream and walk her down the aisle at her wedding.

Donna, who has four children, daughter Charlie, 17, and sons Jordan, 15, Corey, nine and two-year-old Bobby, was married to Rueben, 38, in Solihull, West Mids., on August 24 last year.

She and her family now regularly meet up with Bill when he travels 150 miles from his flat in Spalding, Lincs., to their home in Birmingham.

Donna said: 'It’s a miracle I finally found my father and I’m delighted his first ‘fatherly’ duty was to walk me down the aisle and give me away.

'My mum got pregnant with me after a fling with my dad. They met in a social club and one thing led to another.

'He only met me once when I was a baby but I’m told my family told him they would raise me so he left.

'I was raised knowing my dad was out there somewhere but had no idea what his name was other than Bill.

'When I got engaged to Rueben I decided to try and find my dad. I just wanted to know what he was like even if he rejected me.

'My mum had only ever told me his name was Bill, I think she wanted to protect me from getting hurt, but one day she told me his surname.

'The first thing I did was put his name into Facebook and loads of Bill Sneddon’s came up but there was one profile picture which I recognised - it looked just like me.

'I contacted him and asked if he had ever known my mum and he replied and from there we met and discovered we were father and daughter.

'We hit it off straight away and now we call each other all the time on the phone, I call him dad and I’ve met his son and daughter and we all get on like a big family.'

Bill, 60, who worked for a food vending company, added: 'It was one of the proudest days of my life [walking her down the aisle].

'I always knew I had a daughter out there and I often dreamed of her knocking on my door.

'I feel blessed not just to have my daughter back in my life but also four grandchildren and a great son-in-law.'
