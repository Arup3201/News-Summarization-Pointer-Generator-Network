West Ham United are hoping to lure full-back Carl Jenkinson across London after Arsenal completed the £10million signing of Mathieu Debuchy.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce would like to bring Jenkinson to Upton Park permanently but is also exploring the possibility of acquiring the services of the England international on loan. 

Jenkinson is likely to find his first-team opportunities limited at the Emirates following the arrival of France international Debuchy from Newcastle.

The Magpies themselves had been linked to Jenkinson as a replacement for Debuchy but they announced the arrival of Dutch international right-back Daryl Janmaat on Thursday instead.

Swansea City have already contacted Arsenal about the potential availability of Jenkinson and it looks likely to be a straight race between the Welsh outfit and the Hammers for his signature.

Arsene Wenger is keen to keep Jenkinson in North London as he looks to be build a squad capable of challenging on several fronts, but the 22-year-old may push for a move if he thinks it will help his England chances.
