An elegant home that acted as a makeshift headquarters for the Wells Fargo bank during the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake has been put on the market for $14.9 million - after sitting unsold at $20 million for over a year.

Steeped in West Coast history and grandeur, 2020 Jackson was put up in 1902 on the strong bedrock of the exclusive Pacific Heights neighbourhood and for a time bank executives squeezed into a room of the mansion dealing with thousands of insurance claims.

Built at the time for $45,000 by the Wells Fargo President Isaias Hellman as a wedding gift for his daughter Clara and husband Emanuel, the Louis XVII style property was designed by renowned San Francisco architect Julius E. Krafft, who had emigrated from Germany in 1872.

Many original features of the multi-million pound property still exist within the 11,500 square-foot 'single family residence' and the mansion is currently one of the most expensive properties listed in the Bay area.

Entering into the grand reception hall of the spacious property, a living room, salon and catering kitchen are based on the ground floor of the building.

In the basement is an 'informal 
dining kitchen', a baking kitchen, wine cellar, au-pair's bedroom and a 
large garage for the inevitable super car or luxury town car.

The
first floor of the home boasts a master bedroom which comprises of a 
bedroom, dressing room, walk-in-closet, terrace and his and her 
bathrooms, an office and one additional bedroom.

On
the second floor there are four more bedrooms and three extra bathrooms
complete with a home cinema or media room for entertainment.

home a lower level garden and ground floor terrace which both have 
stunning panaromic views of the San Francisco Bay that stretch out

Wells Fargo Bank President Isaias 
Hellman gifted the luxurious home to his daughter Clara upon her 
marriage to prominent lawyer Emanuel S. Heller.

During
the 1906 earthquake and fires which killed 3,500 people and inflicted 
$400,000,000 worth of damage to the city, the Hellman Heller mansion 
served as the temporary base for the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank.

With
millionaire financiers and insurers crammed into one small room it has 
been reported that the only place to have a private conversation about 
business was in the adjoining tiny bathroom.

Indeed, the Hellman and Heller's contribution to San Francisco is immense.

Heller's
burgeoning law-firm prospered to become Heller Ehrman and they 
negotiated the financial plan for the city's Bay Bridge, helped put 
together the consortium that constructed the Hoover Dam.

In
another brush with history, 2020 Jackson street was the scene of the 
main reception for the United Nations Conference on International 
Organisation that eventually drew up the United Nations Charter.

On the fourth floor there are an additional four guest bedrooms and three full bathrooms

The office is paneled with Cuban Mahogany walls and built in bookcases, cabinetry and a custom black marble fireplace

One of the adjacent rooms on the second floor has been converted into a games room

The outdoors terrace is accessible through the dining room and has extensive views of the San Francisco Bay

The mansion also bosts beautiful views of Russian Hill, Nob Hill and the Transamerica Pyramid

The gourmet kitchen is situated in the basement level of the 100 + year-old property
