The process of labour and delivery usually looms large in a pregnant woman's thoughts, with extensive birthing plans and preparation very much the norm.

But in a story sure to terrify expectant mothers everywhere, a mother-of-two delivered her own baby in breakneck speed - whilst she was sitting on her toilet.

In just thirty minutes, Charlie Francis-Pape, 27, from Bridport, Dorset, delivered her baby girl after rushing to the bathroom thinking she needed the loo.

Although she had been in some discomfort for about 20 minutes, but she assumed she would have hours of labour and so did not rush to action.

Once on the toilet the English teacher felt a sudden need to push, and her baby fell into her arms just seconds later.

Charlie said: 'I'd been in pain for about twenty minutes.

'But all of a sudden I felt like I needed the toilet. I staggered to the loo, sat down, and before I knew it I could see the baby's head.

'I lifted myself off the seat and 
just caught her as she came out. It all happened so quickly, I don't 
think I even realised what had happened until afterwards.

'I suppose it's quite funny that I gave birth on the loo - but at the time it was the best place for it.'

Whilst
baby Winter Ami survived her dramatic delivery unscathed, mother 
Charlie had to be rushed to hospital after haemorrhaging.

The couple had carefully planned a hypno birth for Winter (right) after Charlie had a bad birthing experience with her first daughter (pictured left with the family)

Luckily, both mum and baby have now recovered from Winter's exciting start to life.

Charlie said: 'It's only now that I look back on it all and realise that it was quite exciting.

'At the time I was just following my instincts.

'The funny thing is my eldest daughter Devon, whose bedroom is next to the toilet, slept through the whole thing.'

The mum of two had planned on having a relaxing hypnobirth, after suffering a painful 21 hour labour with her eldest daughter.

Baby Winter who was born in a incredibly fast thirty minutes, seemed undisturbed by her rather dramatic arrival

Charlie said: 'My husband and I spent
a lot of time and money on hypnobirthing. You use lots of relaxation 
techniques and massage, and the idea is that you associate labour with 
something positive.

'We wanted to have the baby at home, so had a birthing pool set up in the living room.

'We just expected it to go very smoothly.'

However, Charlie's plans were scuppered when she woke up during the night in pain.

'We just expected it to go very smoothly' Charlie admits

Charlie said: 'Devon had woken me up 
in the night. I went to comfort her and was just settling myself back 
into bed when my waters broke.

'I was astonished because the baby was one week overdue and I just never thought it would happen.

'In the time it took for me to walk downstairs to call my husband - who was at work - the pain had really started.

'But I just lit some candles and put on some relaxing music - I wasn't expecting to meet my daughter for a long time yet.'

But whilst Charlie was expecting a slow birth, her baby had other plans.

Charlie said: 'Ten minutes later my husband came home and by this point I was getting quite concerned so I asked him to call the midwife.

'But just five minutes later I felt the urge to go to the toilet.

'I staggered across to the landing, sat on the toilet, and before I knew it I'd delivered my baby.

'When she was born I just followed my instincts. I pulled her onto my chest and gave her a rub to get her breathing.

'My husband was still on the phone to the midwife, when the baby came out all pink and wriggling around, so I knew she was ok.'

In fact, it was mum Charlie that took a turn for the worse, and was rushed to Dorchester Hospital after haemorrhaging from her womb.

Luckily, doctors were able to give the new mum blood transfusions and she is now fully recovered.
