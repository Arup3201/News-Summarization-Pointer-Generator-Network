Police are appealing to the public to help solve a 15-year-old cold case, offering a $250,000 reward for anyone who can help investigations into the disappearance of a 21-year-old man.

Marc Christian Mietus went missing on Australia Day in 2000 in Queensland after picking up a hitchhiker.

On January 4 2000, the young man was in the process of moving from his family home in Melbourne to Brisbane, hoping for a new start and to 'get his life back on track' according to his father, Kris Mietus. 

The victim's father is pleading with the public to come forward with information so his family can finally have closure from the traumatic experience of losing their beloved son.

'I've got to be honest, I've probably resigned myself to the fact that he has met foul play,' Mr Mietus said at a press conference on Tuesday.

'The family, including myself and his two sisters, have (come to this conclusion).' 

For 15 years Marc Mietus' loved ones have struggled after the 21-year-old 'vanished without a trace'. 

'We're after closure and once we get that we can move on. It's very difficult not to,' Mr Mietus explained. 

Mr Mietus was travelling alone from Melbourne to Queensland when he encountered a hitchhiker.

'During his car journey, Mr Mietus picked up a hitchhiker,' Detective Superintendent Steve Holohan of the Homicide Group said. 

To repay the favour, the hitchhiker offered Mr Mietus accomodation at his property in the Wide Bay region, 70 kilometres inland from Bundaberg.

'Marc befriended the man who allowed him to stay in a caravan on his property on Dillarnil Booyal Road, Booyal via Childers.'

Mr Mietus made his home at the Booyal property, whilst also spending time at another friend's residence in Kelvin Grove, an inner northern suburb of Brisbane.

At about 6.30am on January 26 2000 Marc is believed to have arrived back at the Booyal property on his red 250cc Honda road trail bike.

After spending time at the property and making several phone calls he was seen leaving the home in a car with of a group of people, believed to be heading to Brisbane. 

He has not been seen since and police believe Marc may have met with foul play.

Despite extensive searches and investigating all leads on the case, police are still yet to determine what happened to the plumbing apprentice after he left the house.  

'Certainly, we believe there are people out there that know what happened to him and others who have crucial information regarding this case,' said Detective Holohan.

'We are offering $250,000 for anybody who gives information that leads to the identification of the person responsible for the homicide

'We strongly suspect he was met with foul play somewhere between Childers and Brisbane.'

The missing man's distressed father spoke at a police conference, speaking openly about his son in the hope it would help finally find answers.

'There were probably two key things in his life which set him in a direction which the family wasn’t really impressed with,' his father revealed.

'His mother walked out when he was 15 years of age,' Kris Mietus explained. 

This abandonment is believed to have had a profound effect on the teen who became involved with 'the wrong crowd'.

'Up until 15 he was a very gifted child and had a great association with everybody in the family,' said Mietus.

The talented athlete was also rejected in his attempts to become a professional AFL player.

'It set him off on the wrong path and he probably associated with the wrong people. He probably shouldn’t have been smoking marijuana,' his father told the press conferenece.

But as the 21-year-old set off for Queensland just weeks before his disappearance he was determined to turn over a new leaf. 

Instead, it is believed he lost his life and 15 years later his family are still fighting to uncover how. 

'Someone’s obviously done away with him and we want that person brought to justice,' said Kris. 

Mr Mietus' desperate father has spoken frankly about his son, revealing that the young man fell into the wrong crowd after his mother left and he was rejected from an AFL opportunity
