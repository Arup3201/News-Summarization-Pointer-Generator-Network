It was Everton's big moment: a press conference had been called for 7pm on Wednesday, July 30 at Finch Farm to unveil the player Roberto Martinez had 'saved up' for.

Rather than go out and pick a £5million player here and an £8million player there, Martinez had let last January drift without doing any significant business so he had a substantial kitty to play with in the summer. He knew Romelu Lukaku was the man to spend it all on.

The paperwork took longer than envisaged to complete but at 8.43pm Lukaku – all £28million of him – walked in to the media auditorium, accompanied by a beaming Martinez. This was what he had wanted; so enthused was the manager he later said he would have gone to £100million.

On the back of his outstanding loan spell from Chelsea last season, when he scored 15 goals and helped Everton finish fifth in the Barclays Premier League, it was expected that Lukaku and his team would progress hand in hand. Nothing that balmy night suggested there would be a problem.

Fast forward to mid-winter, though, and Lukaku has struggled to live up to his grand billing. Martinez had an inkling that, after being at the World Cup, it would take the 21-year-old time to reach top speed but should he still be waiting for him to get there in the first week of January?

His performance numbers do not suggest major problems. Lukaku has scored six times, made two assists and has been regularly available for games. There have not been any underlying fitness issues and he has avoided the curse of the hamstring strain that has afflicted some of Everton's squad.

Dig a little deeper and you will see the issue is that he is not getting involved enough in games. His six Premier League goals have come at conversion rate of every 14.3 shots. The average number for a top end Premier League striker is above 25. Is he actually being put into the positions to flourish?

One former Everton player certainly doesn't think so.

'If I was Romelu Lukaku I would seriously be knocking on the gaffer's door and saying "Seriously, is there any chance of me getting in the game more often? Because I never see the football",' Andy Gray, a focal point of Everton's 1984-85 championship winning team, argued.

'I feel a little bit sorry for him. What's the point in paying £28m for a centre forward, who did ever so well last year because we got him more involved in the game than we are doing this year. He was a threat and he was a handful.

'But there is no point in having him up there if we are going to pass it along the back, into midfield, back again, into left back, across to right back, back again and he's doing little shuttles at the top end of the pitch wondering "when is the ball going to arrive at me?"'

Gray's words carry substance. There is a feeling Everton are now easy to play against, predictable almost. Certainly, there has been no game this year where Lukaku has been central to Martinez hatching a plan, such as when he played from the right and terrorised Arsenal at Goodison.

Lukaku, a hulking figure who honed his physique during adolescence by doing 150 sit ups a day, has the power to be a formidable target man and Everton could utilise his attributes by playing a more direct game. That, however, is never going to happen under Martinez.

Yet sympathy for Lukaku can only stretch so far. He is only a young man and has to realise he can't sit and wait for the opportunities: Martinez didn't pay £28m for him to run on to balls – that fee was paid for the Belgian to energise Everton's forward line, to give them dynamism.

Without a goal in his last six appearances, Lukaku must take that on board on Tuesday evening when West Ham arrive at Goodison and Everton's season precariously balanced. 

Now is the time for Lukaku, a man who does not lack for self-confidence, to show he was worth the wait.
