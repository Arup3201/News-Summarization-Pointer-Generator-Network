A Pasadena City College professor who's made a name for himself as a male feminist has had an epic online breakdown and admitted to having an affair with a 23-year-old.

Hugo Schwyzer let loose in an hour-long Twitter tirade Friday following revelations in early August that the 46-year-old married father-of-two was sexting 27-year-old porn star Christina Parreira.

After news broke about Schwyzer's affair, he took a self-imposed hiatus from social media. It was broken on Friday in a major way, when he began tweeting, almost non-stop, for an hour.

'Breathtakingly cocky': Professor Hugo Schwyzer admitted to being an academic fraud and a bad feminist during an hour-long Twitter rant

The focus of the vitriol spouted during the meltdown was Schwyzer himself. Labeling himself a 'hypocrite', Schwyzer listed the ways in which he had betrayed his students, readers and family.

More than 100 tweets detail infidelity, a fraudulent career in feminist studies and mental illness.

Schwyzer had already put many feminist groups offside after admitting having inappropriate relationships with many of his students when he first began teaching at Pasadena Community College.

Schwyzer began his tweet-fest by telling his followers he was in the midst of a manic episode. He says he suffers from bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

He referred to himself as a 'breathtakingly cocky fraud,' and said it was time for the truth to out.

He wrote, 'So the real story you all missed is that I talked my way into teaching women's studies on the basis of 2 undergrad courses only.'

The professor, whose area of expertise is
 actually 'British medieval church history,' admitted to never having 
published an academic article on feminism.

His work for sites such as The Atlantic and Jezebel, was, he said, a way of getting attention, and that while he loved his students, 'I loved the attention more and I was f***ing awesome at getting it.'

'I appropriated the language of redemption, I knew which buttons to push, I used sex and charm and whiteness and it usually worked.'

Schwyzer told his Twitter fans that the same week an article he wrote condemning age-disparate relationships was published in the Atlantic, he was sleeping with a 23-year-old and sexting a 27-year-old.

'I'm a monstrous hypocrite,' he wrote.

'You can denounce me now. I'm out of feminism, not because I don't believe in it, but because I'm such a p***poor example of it all.'

The Twitter diatribe ended when Schwyzer wrote that he was giving his laptop and Twitter password to a family member and staying offline.

Schwyzer said he will take medical leave from his tenure position at Pasadena Community College following the revelations about his infidelity, to deal with his mental illnesses and repair his marriage.

'I’ve put myself on medical leave, but I 
haven’t broken a single academic rule,' Schwyzer told the New York Daily News.

'My penis is all 
over the internet but I haven’t broken the university’s code of 
conduct.'

Screen shots of Schwyzer's texts to a porn actress, identified as Christina Parreira, began surfacing early this month.

Parreira said Schwyzer divulged fantasies about participating in a threesome with Perriera and porn actor James Deen - in front of the students of his infamous Humanities 3 class, known as 'Navigating Porn'.

'I will never teach women's studies or gender studies again. If I can get well and beat this, I will teach my Western Civ courses,' promised Schwyer.

Though he has taken leave of Twitter for the time being, Schwyzer managed to give an interview today to the Daily Beast.

When asked about his motivations, he said, 'For me the motivation was not to get these girls into bed. Sex is only the exclamation point on what you really want. What I am addicted to is affirmation and validation from women... What mattered to me is that they had me on a pedestal, that they thought about me. That is the honest truth.'

Pasadena City College spokesman Juan Gutierrez said last week that he was unaware of Schwyzer’s plan to take medical leave.

'We have not received any direct indication that professor Schwyzer will not be at PCC in the fall,' Gutierrez told the Pasadena Star News.

'Should professor Schwyzer indicate that he is in need of any support from the college regarding this situation or health issues, we will extend that support in any way possible.'
