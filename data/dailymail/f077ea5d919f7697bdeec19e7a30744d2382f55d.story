'Stitched up': Insiders say Helen Boaden, pictured, who has stepped aside, was betrayed by senior BBC executives

The Corporation’s most high-profile woman executive and her deputy have hired lawyers to refute a BBC statement that they have 'stepped aside' from their jobs.

Director of news Helen Boaden, 56, was told it was impossible for her 
to stay in her £354,000-a-year role while she faces questions over the 
Jimmy Savile scandal.

Both she and executive Stephen 
Mitchell have been relieved of their duties by acting director general, Tim Davie, while the decision not to air an investigation 
into allegations of child abuse by Savile is reviewed by former Sky News
 boss Nick Pollard.

A statement released by the corporation yesterday claimed that Miss Boaden had 'decided that she is not in a position to undertake' her role until the results of the review.

But it is understood that Mr Davie ‘suggested’ the course of action to Miss Boaden and both she and Mr Mitchell reportedly believed they were able to continue their jobs while the Pollard Review is carried out.

Robert Peston, the BBC's business editor, revealed in his blog yesterday that 'lawyers acting for Ms Boaden and Mr Mitchell have informed Mr Davie that they are quite capable of running BBC News, even with the uncertainty created by the Pollard inquiry'.

It has also emerged that Miss Boaden may be on the brink of leaving the broadcaster after she was forced to ‘step aside’ yesterday.

If she does leave the BBC, she is 
likely to demand a huge compensation payment. She had already engaged 
lawyers to help answer Mr Pollard’s questions.

Insiders have accused senior 
executives of trying to ‘stitch up’ Miss Boaden and force her out of the
 corporation after the departure of director general George Entwistle.

One insider told the Telegraph that the truth about the two executives was 'not how the BBC have made it appear', adding: 'They are not happy to be going at all'.

The timing of yesterday’s announcement
 suggested that Miss Boaden and Mr Mitchell were being blamed for the 
appalling failures of Newsnight, which wrongly claimed on November 2 
that a senior Tory was complicit in child abuse.

In fact, both 
executives had played no part in the decision to screen the film, 
because they had been told to steer clear of any ‘Savile-related’ 
stories.

Sources say this resulted in a power 
vacuum at the top of BBC news, which may have contributed to the 
decision to broadcast the Newsnight report without even asking the Tory 
in question, Lord McAlpine, about the story.

The BBC claims that removing Miss 
Boaden and Mr Mitchell will solve this problem – but was forced to make 
it ‘absolutely clear’ that the pair had nothing to do with the McAlpine 
story.

Although it did not name the Tory peer, the report provided 
enough clues to prompt a wave of wholly untrue allegations about Lord 
McAlpine on social networking sites.

The BBC said the executives were 
moving aside to resolve the ‘lack of clarity’ about who is in charge of 
BBC news while Mr Pollard’s review continues.

The corporation added that
 ‘they expect then to return to their positions’ when the investigation 
concludes.

However, one source said: ‘You have to
 assume the decision has been taken to get them out and they will try 
and find a way of getting them out.'

Fran Unsworth, BBC newsgathering head since 2005, is temporarily taking over from Helen Boaden as the Corporation's news chief.

The 54-year-old started in BBC local radio before going to Radio 1’s Newsbeat and later working for BBC Radio 4’s The World at One.

A former radio producer in Washington D.C. and a 25-year BBC veteran, she also worked as head of BBC political programming.

In her job as head of newsgathering she is responsible for around 800 staff working in the UK and abroad, on a salary of £166,650.

The Manchester University drama graduate, who has a flat in Marylebone, west London, is from North Staffordshire and is president of the media group Society of Editors.

The statement said: ‘The BBC wants 
to make it absolutely clear that neither Helen Boaden nor Stephen 
Mitchell had anything at all to do with the failed Newsnight 
investigation into Lord McAlpine.’

However, it added there was a ‘a lack 
of clarity in the lines of command and control’ at BBC News due to the 
executives ‘caught up in the Pollard Review’.

It continued: ‘In the 
circumstances Helen and Stephen will be stepping aside from their normal
 roles until the Pollard Review reports and they expect then to return 
to their positions.’

The BBC’s head of newsgathering, Fran 
Unsworth, and Ceri Thomas, the editor of Radio 4’s Today programme, are 
to fill in for Miss Boaden and Mr Mitchell respectively.

Karen O’Connor, a former deputy editor of Panorama and Newsnight, has been drafted in as acting editor of the latter programme.

As director of news, Miss Boaden was 
responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the 
broadcaster’s news and current affairs output, including Question Time, 
Panorama, the Today Programme and Newsnight. Her position had been in 
question for weeks, following the eruption of the Savile scandal.

Ceri Thomas, a former editor of Radio 5 Live's breakfast programme, took over from Kevin Marsh as editor of Radio 4's flagship Today programme in 2006.

The 49-year-old started his broadcasting career in 1989 at LBC Radio and joined Today as a junior producer two years later.

He was listed by MediaGuardian this year as the 70th most influential person in the media and has previously been praised by Ms Boaden for his 'flair and passion for radio'.

The newspaper praised Today for remaining 'required listening' but said Mr Thomas was 'dogged by criticism that the show is too male'.

It is known that she told Mr Entwistle
 – then running BBC TV – at an awards lunch last year that Newsnight was
 planning to run a report about claims that Savile abused young girls, 
which could affect Mr Entwistle’s plans for Christmas shows paying 
tribute to the presenter.

Sources at Newsnight have also suggested that 
she warned the programme’s then editor, Peter Rippon – who has also 
since stepped aside – that he needed to be sure of his facts before 
screening any claims that Savile was a criminal.

Miss Boaden’s removal will be a bitter blow to a woman who months ago was hailed as a contender to run the BBC.

She began at the corporation almost 30
 years ago, working as a news producer at BBC Radio Leeds before going 
on to work as a reporter and then editor of Radio 4’s File on 4, and as a
 presenter on Woman’s Hour.

She took responsibility for business programmes on the station in 1997 and was made station controller three years later.

Fiercely defensive of the station’s 
‘intelligent’ programming that ‘feeds the mind’ she helped it to reach 
audiences of 10million for the first time.

Despite running Radio 4 during another
 BBC crisis – when an infamous Today programme  report sparked the 
Hutton Inquiry – she escaped censure because the show is governed by the
 BBC News division.

In the wake of the scandal Miss Boaden was promoted to become said division’s first female director in 2004.

This year she applied to become 
director general but was beaten by Mr Entwistle. It is understood she 
was offered a senior role in radio instead, but turned it down.

John Simpson said over-management had been a 'serious blight' on the BBC

Senior BBC broadcasters turned on their masters in spectacular fashion yesterday.

They joined Jeremy Paxman in a growing mutiny against a ‘bonkers’ BBC which undervalues staff and swells the ranks of managers.

Radio 4 host Libby Purves waded into the fracas to call for more bloodletting in the ‘bloated, ineffectual’ upper layers of management.

The fightback was spearheaded by Newsnight veteran Paxman when he said George Entwistle had been ‘brought low by cowards and incompetents,’ and branded BBC managers ‘biddable time-servers’.

John Simpson, the BBC’s world affairs editor, said over-management had been ‘a serious blight on the BBC since the Eighties’. He said ‘savage cuts’ imposed on the BBC had mainly fallen on programme-makers and broadcasters.

Mr Simpson added: ‘The proliferation of middle managers in the BBC was something that Lord Patten wanted to deal with; but the decisions about who should be sacked were all too often made by middle managers.’ 

Executives in the BBC news department  have included Helen Boaden, who earns £354,000 a year to take ‘overall editorial responsibility’; Stephen Mitchell, on £203,000 to take ‘managerial and editorial responsibility’; David Jordan, paid £174,000 to ‘produce editorial guidelines’; Sue Inglish, earning £141,000 to take ‘managerial responsibility for political news’ and Mary Hockaday, the Head of Newsroom in charge of ‘editorial leadership’.

Midweek presenter Miss Purves said some of these managers should be sacked, adding: ‘I do not know which of the above bear responsibility for which disaster. But some of them have to go, and possibly their job titles with them.’ 

She wrote in The Times: ‘Tell the smug mandarins of the news departments to shape up, pay attention, and do their jobs with decision, perceptiveness, openness and generosity – or go away. ‘We need some pretty senior firings in the executive and legal layers. In both recent scandals the evidence of sly, uncommunicative, nervously arrogant incompetence is simply too strong to ignore.’ 

Within hours, the new man leading the BBC, Tim Davie, issued a jargon-infested statement promising to be ‘visible and available’. He described a process by which he ‘will transition’ to his new job of boss of BBC Worldwide after the corporation appoints a new DG.
