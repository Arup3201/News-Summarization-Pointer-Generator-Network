BBC commentator Mark Lawrenson has come under fire for a 'sexist' comment made during the Argentina versus Switzerland World Cup game.

Switzerland striker Josip Drmic's weak shot at goal during their round of 16 clash with Argentina on Tuesday evening prompted Lawrenson to state Drmic 'should have put a skirt on'.

Lawrenson's comment caused a storm on social media and has triggered 172 angry complaints to the BBC with claims it was offensive and sexist.

The BBC received more than 400 complaints
 about former Everton player Phil Neville's performance.

However, the corporation has defended its World Cup coverage.

It acknowledged that some fans were unhappy but it brushed aside the complaints, insisting its team was 'very strong' and it will 'take 
time' for viewers to get used to them.

In a statement released late last month it said: 'We believe we have put together a very strong international line-up, with a wealth of experience and knowledge covering all aspects of the game at the very highest level.

'Thoughts on individual presenters and commentators can vary considerably so it's inevitable some viewers or listeners will dislike or disapprove of certain presenters and commentators.'
