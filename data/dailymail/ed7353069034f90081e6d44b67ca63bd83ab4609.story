Exams will be toughened in the wake of the scandal over teachers being ‘coached’ by examiners in how to improve marks, Michael Gove has warned.

The Education Secretary said he was concerned that teachers and pupils had ‘too much certainty over which elements of the curriculum will be tested’.

Exam watchdog Ofqual yesterday ordered the rewriting of a GCSE exam paper and threatened further action as part of an investigation into allegations that exam boards are giving unfair advice to teachers.

The regulator said examiners had shared inappropriate details about an 
information and communications technology paper due to be taken by 450 
pupils next month. It will be sat at a later date.

Earlier this month, it was claimed that teachers were paying up to £230 a
day to attend seminars with chief examiners, during which they were advised on questions and wording pupils should use to get higher marks.

Mr Gove has said that 'larger-scale reform' of exams may be necessary in the future

Three examiners, from WJEC, the Welsh exam board, and Edexcel were suspended.

Yesterday Mr Gove warned that ‘larger-scale reform’ of exams might now be necessary.

He expressed concern some had argued coaching was ‘within the letter’ of exam rules.

He said: ‘Providing teachers and students with too much certainty over which elements of the curriculum will be tested, or which questions will be asked, only serves to narrow the curriculum, lower standards and promote teaching to the test.

‘I was therefore pleased to see that you will be reviewing what role seminars should play in our qualification system in future.

‘In addition, it will be important to look at the exam rules in the short term to ensure they are consistently applied and properly limit the information that can be given out.

‘In the longer term, as we redevelop requirements for A-levels and GCSEs, I shall seek to ensure there is sufficient 'unpredictability' and rigour in those specifications to underpin public confidence that exams are true tests of ability across a suitably broad and challenging syllabus.

‘I do not rule out that a larger-scale reform might be necessary.’ Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg called for ‘a level playing field’
