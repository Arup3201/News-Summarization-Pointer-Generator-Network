The parents of a 14-year-old boy are furious after their son was excluded from school for spending two minutes too long in the toilet.

McCauley Timmins, a year 10 pupil at Outwood Academy Valley in Worksop,  was sent home because he spent seven minutes in the toilet instead of the school's regulation of five. 

His father, Stewart, 56, was disgusted by the decision on Monday and said it was a 'form of bullying' as his son was feeling unwell.

He said: 'They only allow five minutes to go to the toilet and McCauley was seven minutes. He was only that long because he wasn't feeling well.

'We knew he wasn't well and we nearly didn't send him to school but we thought he should give it a try.

'He had a second exclusion the same week, because on Wednesday he asked to go to the toilet while he was was in isolation and they are only allowed to go three times a day.

'Even in normal school time toilet breaks are limited.

'He pleaded with them, they wouldn't let him go, so he went anyway because he was going to wet himself, and the excluded him for that as well.

'I believe it is a form of bullying. I have looked into it and they shouldn't be allowed to do it.'

An automatic exclusion means the pupil is excluded from the rest of the day's school and sent home. The next day is spent in isolation, separate from the rest of his class. This is finally followed by detention at the end of the day. 

His mother, Emma, 38, said the issue with the toilet breaks was 'ruining his education' at school 

His father, Stewart, 56, complained that the school (pictured) were unwilling to discuss the problem with him

Mr Timmins, a regional sales manager, added: 'You cannot speak to that school, they refuse point blank to discuss things with you.

'We want the school to start being reasonable with the punishments they dish out, the punishment should fit the crime.

'There is no leeway with them, it is very draconian.

'I don't mind them being strict but they should be reasonable.'

His wife Emma, 38, said: 'He is doing really well at school but it is ruining his education.'

The couple, of Worksop, have two other children, Morgen, 15, and Elliot, five.

The school was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline.
