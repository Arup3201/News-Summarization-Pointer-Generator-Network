Patients are having to wait longer than six hours in ambulances parked outside A&E departments.

Last week alone nearly 4,500 patients were kept in the  vehicles for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to look after them.

Figures obtained by BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act covered the three months until the end of October, and revealed that a patient in Wales was forced to wait six hours and 22 minutes, while another in East England was held for five hours and 51 minutes.

Senior doctors and nurses said waits in most recent weeks could have been even longer.

The
figures will add to concerns that casualty departments are struggling 
to cope with the rising numbers of patients expected this winter.

Dr
Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency  Medicine, which 
represents  casualty doctors, said: ‘These figures relate to the three 
months up until October.

‘They
don’t include the really pressured time of the winter and so it’s 
unlikely these figures are going to improve – and that must be a cause 
for concern. There’s always going to be a small number of patients whose
transfer is delayed, but not to the extent of these figures.’

Ambulance
crews are meant to spend no longer than 15 minutes transferring 
patients from their vehicles and if they breach this limit, hospitals 
are fined. But if staff are too busy, the  paramedics have to carry on 
caring for them and at times there may be dozens of vehicles queued up 
outside hospitals.

It means 
the ambulances are effectively immobilised and unable to attend other 
999 callouts, while patients are also at risk  of deteriorating in the 
backs  of vehicles. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal 
College of Nursing, said: ‘Things are going to get that much worse.

‘It’s very difficult now to discharge older people due to the huge cutbacks in social care.

‘An
older person falls down, breaks a hip, has a hip replacement but then 
can’t go home because the infrastructure and carers aren’t in place. 
Their discharge is delayed, then patients coming in to A&E end up on
trolleys as there are no beds and everything becomes silted up.’ Last 
year Norfolk and Norwich Hospital was forced to put up a tent outside 
its casualty unit after 15 ambulances had to queue at a time. The trust 
was fined £3million for keeping patients waiting.

And once inside hospitals, some patients are forced to wait even longer on trolleys before they are moved to wards.

Separate
data from NHS  England shows that last week 4,476 patients waited for 
at least 30 minutes in ambulances – up from 3,783 the previous week.

Shadow
health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Ambulances are trapped in queues 
at A&Es, unable to hand over patients at bursting hospitals. 
Ministers are leaving large swathes of the country without adequate 
ambulance cover.’

But 
Barbara Hakin, deputy chief executive of NHS England, said the number of
ambulances queuing was down compared with the same week last year.

She said: ‘These long waits are the exception. We are not complacent, we want to make sure they don’t happen.

‘Whatever
happens, individual patient safety will take priority. There will 
always be instances where, because of a particular patient and their 
illness, we do get the occasional long waits. If a patient is very ill, 
they may need to be treated in the ambulance.’
