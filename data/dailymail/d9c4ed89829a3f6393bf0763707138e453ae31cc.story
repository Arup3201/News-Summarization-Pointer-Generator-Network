Doctors in Albuquerque, New Mexico say it is a miracle that a newborn baby girl survived after her mom was struck by lightning on July 4.

Heavily pregnant Kendra Villanueva and her boyfriend Ian Gordon were watching the Independence Day fireworks with friends when a storm approached.

As the couple made their way indoors they were struck by lightning underneath a tree in Gordon’s mom’s front yard.

Miracle baby: Kimberly Samantha Rose remains in hospital, but is expected to be okay

‘I had turned and started walking,’ Gordon told KCCI. ‘And next thing I remember, I woke up on the ground. My car alarm was blaring and I was dazed. I didn't know what happened.’

Fortunately firefighters who were nearby at another call were able to arrive at the scene within minutes.

Villanueva said she woke up to find her hand was bleeding from where electricity left her body, but her main concern was for her unborn baby.

The couple were rushed to hospital where doctors carried out an emergency C-section on Villanueva who was two weeks and half weeks away from her due date.

Both parents face long-term muscle spasms as a result of being struck by lightning

Miraculously, baby Kimberly Samantha Rose Gordon survived the ordeal. She remains being monitored in hospital and is expected to be okay.

An EMS doctor who treated the couple at the scene said there have only been 11 recorded incidents of a pregnant woman being struck by lightning - anywhere - and only about half of those babies survived, reports KRQE.

Gordon suffered a ruptured eardrum from where the lightning either entered or exited through his left ear and he can’t currently hear out of it.

Both parents face long-term muscle spasms as a result of the incident and Gordon is also using a cane while he regains his strength and balance.
