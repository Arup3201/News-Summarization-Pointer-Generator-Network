Valerie Trierweiler was all smiles as she was pictured in public for the first time since her break-up with Francois Hollande.

The former French first lady put on a brave face as she beamed for the cameras outside the Christian Dior Womenswear show at Paris Fashion Week on Friday.

However, with no presidential limousine to whisk her home afterwards, she decided to take the Metro instead, with some passengers seemingly unaware that the president’s former partner was on the platform.

Trierweiler told Paris Match magazine that when she found out that Hollande was ending their relationship it ‘was like I'd fallen from a skyscraper’.

Hollande drew headlines and ridicule worldwide in January after a gossip magazine reported that he had zipped through Paris in a face-covering helmet on a motor scooter for a tryst with French actress Julie Gayet - unbeknownst to his first lady.

Trierweiler added: ‘Clearly I had heard the rumours but you heard (rumours) about everyone. I hear them about myself too, all of the time. I paid no attention to them.’

According to The Telegraph, Trierweiler, 48, says she has spoken to Hollande on the phone every day since he announced he was ending their 'shared life together.'

Hollande apparently called her on the first day of her trip to Mumbai, where she launched a charity in defiance of Elysee staff, and again after a press conference yesterday when she stressed their relationship would not be rekindled.

Trierweiler has also confirmed that she will not be returning to the 'cynicism' of political journalism following the split, and instead plans to launch a career as a humanitarian campaigner.

Following the split Trierweiler made a tour of children’s hospitals in India.

While there she told reporters that she blamed the break-up on 'low blows', 'betrayals' and 'back-stabbing'.

Other famous people at the Dior show included actress Jessica Alba and pop superstar Rihanna.

Hollande, meanwhile, was in the Central African Republic to tell its leaders and French forces stationed there that France will work to stop the country splitting in two.
