An astonishing confrontation on live TV  between Andrew Neil and a shouting U.S. conspiracy theorist saw the veteran broadcaster label him an ‘idiot’ and ‘the worst person I've ever interviewed’.

U.S. radio host Alex Jones was on BBC One’s Sunday Politics with journalist David Aaronovitch to discuss the secretive Bilderberg Conference, which has been taking place over the past week.

But Mr Jones, 39, launched into a noisy rant about the theories available on his website about the U.S. government ‘disappearing people’, which led to him eventually being cut off by Mr Neil, 64.

Mr Neil told him: 'You (Mr Jones) are the worst person I've ever interviewed. David (Aaronovitch), thank you for being with us. It's gone half past 11. You're watching the Sunday Politics.'

The presenter then added: ‘We have an idiot on the programme today’, before using hand gestures to indicate that Mr Jones had lost his mind, as the American continued to shout at him off camera.

Mr Jones had said: ‘Hey listen, I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game. Our government, the US, is building Fema (Federal Emergency Management Agency) camps.

‘We have an NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) where they disappear people now. You have this arrest for public safety, life in prison. It's basically off with their heads, disappear them.

‘Take them away. Infowars.com. Liberty is rising. Liberty is rising. Freedom will not stop. You will not stop freedom. You will not stop the republic. Humanity is awakening. Infowars.com.

‘No, you guys are crazy, thinking that 
the public's too stupid. You're crazy, thinking the public doesn't know.
You're crazy, thinking the public isn't waking up.’

Mr Jones had already told the programme that the creation of the Euro was a 'Nazi German plan' and said Bilderberg is 'heavily involved in the EU plan'. He added: ‘We have forced them from cover to admit they’re puppeteers above the major parties.

Mr Neil later said on Twitter: 'The moment Alex Jones knew he was no longer on air he stopped.'

The shouting at the end of the show - which was criticised as 'all an act' by Mr Neil - was immediately labelled 'spectacular' by the Mail's James Chapman and 'TV gold' by the political blog Guido Fawkes.

The Bilderberg Conference is an international group of politicians, business leaders and academics who meet behind closed doors - this year at a luxury country hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire.

Piers Morgan is another British broadcaster to have felt the roar of Alex Jones in a live TV interview.

Mr Morgan, 48, brought the radio talk show host onto his CNN show in January to explain why he thought the journalist should be banned from the U.S. for his views on gun control.

The topic had been the focus of Mr Morgan's prime-time shows for a period following the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Mr Jones, however, spent nearly all of the time screaming at Mr Morgan at the top of his lungs, calling him a 'redcoat foreigner' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to 'take our guns.'

Mr Morgan later wrote about the confrontation in the Mail On Sunday, saying Mr Jones was 'ranting and raving like a gorilla at the zoo who’s just seen the morning bucket of bananas arrive'.

Today Mr Morgan said on Twitter: 'Morning, @afneil - didn't you get my memo on @RealAlexJones?'
