A young driver was yesterday accused of killing his sister and her fiancé - leaving his nine-week-old nephew an orphan.

Corey Davies, 20, was driving his white convertible BMW when his sister Raquel Davies, 23, and her fiancé Lee Jenkins, 25, died in a car crash.

The engaged couple had a baby son called Harley who has been left orphaned by the deaths of his parents.

Victims: Lee Jenkins, 25, and his 23-year-old fiancee Raquel Davies were killed in a road crash

The pair died instantly in the smash because the car’s soft-top gave them no protection when it overturned - but Davies escaped unscathed.

Davies, of Porth, Rhondda, South Wales, appeared before magistrates to face two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and a further charge of leaving the scene of an accident.

He was remanded in custody by Pontypridd magistrates.

A Davies family spokesman said: '[Raquel] was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son.

'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. She loved her fiancé immensely.'

Mr Jenkins’s family said in a statement: “He loved his fiancée Raquel dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley.

'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger.

'We are heartbroken at the loss of Lee and will cherish all the great times and wonderful memories he gave us'

Scene: The pair were passengers in a car on the A4093 through the Welsh valleys near Hendreforgan (pictured)

Police are still appealing for witnesses to the accident last weekend on the A4093 near the village of Gilfach Goch. No other vehicle was involved.

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'We have viewed CCTV footage and believe that people in a number of vehicles, including two buses, may have seen the car in the moments before the accident.

'Specially trained South Wales Police officers are providing support to both families at this difficult time.'

Davies is due to appear before Cardiff Crown Court on June 30.
