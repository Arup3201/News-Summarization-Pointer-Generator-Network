Gobsmacked: Jamie O'Connell had to look twice after spotting the obscene hand gesture in the sky

The National Lottery's 'It Could Be You' advertising campaign was one of the most recognisable of its time, where a cloud formed the shape of a hand and pointed to an unsuspecting winner.

The cloud's over Fort William in Scotland came up with their own take on the idea, when they formed the shape of a hand and made the sort of gesture that suggested its photographer, Jamie O'Connell, probably need not bother buying a ticket this week.

Mr O’Connell was walking his dog along the Caledonian Canal near Neptune’s Staircase when the cloud well and truly gave him the finger.

The 23-year-old had to look twice to make sure he wasn’t imagining the rude hand gesture.

Mr O'Connell, an offshore steward, said: 'I was just walking the dog when I looked up and saw this cloud.

'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I had to double look at it, and I nearly wet myself.

'A lot of people have said it might be a sign - I must have annoyed someone!'

The cloud, which broke through a rainy sky, has become a viral sensation since being Mr O'Connell posted it online.

It's you: Daniel O'Connell was amazed when he spotted this offensive cloud formation in the skies above Fort William

He said: 'It’s so lifelike, it’s hard to believe it’s actually a cloud. It really looks like someone swearing, the detail is unbelievable.

'I think I’ve seen clouds that look a bit like dinosaurs in the past, but no-one has ever flipped off at me through the sky.'

He is now keeping a close eye on the clouds in the hope he will be able to spot other lifelike figures.

He added: 'I’ve always wanted to see Mufassa from The Lion King. He’s been my favourite film character since I was younger. It’s the best film of all time.'
