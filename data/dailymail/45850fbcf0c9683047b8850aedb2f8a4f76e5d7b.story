Manchester City stars - including new signing Fernando - have begun their preparations for the new season ahead of the friendly against Dundee on Sunday.

City will face Dundee at Firs Park on Sunday before playing Hearts in Edinburgh the following Friday.

Manuel Pellegrini's squad then fly to America to play Sporting Kansas City, AC Milan, Liverpool and Olympiacos before facing Arsenal in the Community Shield on August 10 before beginning their title defence with a trip to face Newcastle at St James' Park the following weekend.

Another face involved in City's training session on Friday was Scott Sinclair, whose future with the Premier League champions is in doubt after spending last season on loan at West Brom.

Samir Nasri was also among the City squad, having signed a new long-term contract on Thursday which will keep him at the club until 2019.

With plenty of first-team players still on holiday following their World Cup exploits - and Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis still involved in the tournament - Pellegrini may opt to take a look at his squad depth against Dundee.

Micah Richards, who is expected to leave the club has travelled to Scotland, while Alvara Negredo, who is linked with a transfer back to Spain, is also among the travelling party.

Safe hands: New signing Willy Caballero boards a flight to Scotland with Man City

On board: Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo has been linked with a move away from City this summer

Committed: But Nasri signed a new long-term contract with City until 2019

International duty: Pablo Zabaleta and Sergio Aguero are still away with Argentina

Golden chance: Aguero's Argentina will face Germany in the World Cup final on Sunday
