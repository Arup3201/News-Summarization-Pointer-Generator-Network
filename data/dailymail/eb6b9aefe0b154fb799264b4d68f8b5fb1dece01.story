Former Tottenham Hotspur and France winger David Ginola has confirmed he intends to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency.

But the 47-year-old’s bid to become the most powerful man in football could be over before it’s even started after questions were asked about the legitimacy of Ginola’s candidacy.

His press conference on Friday morning was backed by bookmakers Paddy Power - known for long list of high-profile PR stunts, but not for major sports announcements - and he must meet strict FIFA regulations to run against Blatter.

The idea to back a candidate came from Paddy Power and David Ginola was No 1 on their shortlist. The former player is receiving a £250,000 fee from the bookmakers to front the presidency campaign.

Paddy Power are inviting people to become members on teamginola.com to pledge support and cash. Paid-for memberships range from £5 to £40,000.

Paddy Power are aiming to raise £2.3million by the end of February to fund the campaign. 

Paddy Power himself admitted it was their idea to back a candidate and that Ginola, being paid £250,000 by the bookmakers to run, topped their shortlist. 

Ginola has no known football administration experience and must now prove to FIFA by January 29 he has played an ‘active role’ for at least two of the last five years, and that he has the support of five national associations.

That gives Ginola less than two weeks to ensure he can compete against odds-on favourite Blatter as the 78-year-old attempts to win a fifth term.

 

The ex-Newcastle United and Everton attacking midfielder has yet to receive the support of five associations and called on the public to help raise £2.3million to fight for election on May 29 in Zurich.

If the full amount is raised, Ginola could stand to earn an extra £130,000 with 10 per cent of the final £1.3m raised being pocketed by the Frenchman. 

Ginola faced awkward questions during the announcement about the legitimacy of his bid, his ‘active role’ and why he should be taken seriously, particularly if being paid.

‘I’ve been working in many things. I work for a club in the south of France, as a consultant, and give my advice to those guys who needed help at the time,’ Ginola said.

Ginola is a regular contributor across a range of TV channels like BT Sport and the BBC

‘In 2010 I passed my badges down in Wales. I think the most important thing is I do care about the game. 

‘I do believe that I can stand in front of you and say that I can be the next president because I want to share my ideas, my view of the game. I want a fair game. 

‘Three things are very important: transparency, democracy, and equality. That’s the main thing I want to achieve.

‘The first thing is to get the five associations. That will be the main task in the next few days. It’s not an easy thing. I realise that.

Ginola must get the support of five national football associations before he can stand 

Ginola played in the Premier League for Newcastle, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton before retiring in 2002

‘It is a proper job. It is probably the hardest job of my entire life. Being a footballer is an easy task, compared to what I’m doing right now.’ 

Asked to outline his knowledge on FIFA members, Ginola answered: ‘I need obviously to know a lot more about FIFA.

‘The most important thing I guess is to be standing in front of you today, thinking, well, what can I change? What can I do for the game? 

‘Crucial to that element is the right of football fans to have a say in who will represent them at the highest level in the game. We will deliver a new and fair democratic process.

‘The football community will be asked to elect our officials. There’s no room for doubt in football. If we cannot remove all suspicion and doubt from football, then how can we trust?’ 

The Frenchman has until January 29 to prove he has played an 'active role' in football in two of last five years

He promised any profits would be distributed between the 209 members of FIFA associations to go towards grassroots, development and women’s football. 

Three others have declared an interest in running against Blatter - FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne and the former head of Chilean football, Harold Mayne-Nicholls.

Ginola spent three years with Paris Saint-Germain between 1992 and 1995, before joining Newcastle for £2.5million. He later played for Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton, before retiring.

Ginola won the Player of the Year awards in 1999 at White Hart Lane, winning both the PFA title awarded by his peers and the Football Writers’ award.
