A Muslim woman is suing an Ohio jail for forcing her to attend a Christian prayer service while behind bars.

Sakeena Majeed, 24, was locked up in Cuyahoga County Corrections Center for 60 days in April after having an altercation with a police officer in Cleveland.

She claims that corrections officers made her go to the prayer meets every Friday that were held by a baptist minister. 

They threatened to put her in solitary confinement if she didn't go, The L.A. Times reported.

Violated: Sakeena Majeed, 24, claims an officer at Cuyahoga County Corrections Center threatened her with solitary confinement when she refused to attend the jail's weekly Christian prayer service, which were led by a Baptist minister

Majeed says she told the officers numerous times that she was a practicing Muslim.

She also claims that they 'openly chastised and mocked' her beliefs.

The jail holds about 50 inmates, who are kept in 'pods', not cells.

The inmates are free to travel through certain parts of the jail.

Majeed's lawyer, Matthew Besser, said he is investigating the jail's policies, what acitivites are considered mandatory, and why. 

'At this point, it’s too early to know exactly how widespread the practice is, and has been, and whether it had occurred in other portions of the jail,' Besser told the Los Angeles Times.

'The only evidence I have here is that it occurred in the trustee pod. 

'Our understanding is all the inmates in the pod were forced to go, some were willing and happy to go, and others less so.'

Majeed is seeking unspecified damages.

The lawsuit says her constitutional rights were violated.

Majeed had pleaded pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault after having an argument with a police officer.

Officials from Cuyahoga County have not commented on the lawsuit.
