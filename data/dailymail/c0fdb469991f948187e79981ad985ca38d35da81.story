Liam Fox last night met George Osborne to urge him to take bigger risks to get the economy growing.

The former defence secretary, a standard bearer of the Tory right, enjoyed a drink with Mr Osborne, who is coming under increasing pressure to change course to steer Britain out of the double dip recession.

Today Dr Fox issued a demand for the Treasury to deliver a ‘totemic shock’ to the economy, raising the prospect of massive tax and welfare cuts.

Liam Fox said the Treasury needed to deliver a 'totemic shock' to the economy, including axing capital gains tax for three years

The former Tory leadership challenger also challenged David Cameron to wield the axe on paternity leave and benefits paid to pensioners, something the Prime Minister has repeatedly ruled out.

‘If we don’t take some risks we’ll not get growth and if we don’t get growth we’ll not get re-election, Dr Fox told The Times.

‘We should simply throw down the gauntlet and say that we are cutting our taxes, we are making Britain more competitive, we are going to reform our labour laws, make hiring and firing easier and do what we know works because it’s worked before.’

Speculation is growing that Mr Osborne will use his autumn statement on December 5 to unveil a business-focussed package aimed at stimulating growth.

However, there are doubts about whether the Treasury will be able to meet its target that by 2015-16 debt will be falling as a proportion of gross domestic product.

Liam Fox (right) and George Osborne are old friends, having worked together for many years including on the 2005 Conservative Party election campaign

Sources have played down the idea, insisting the coalition’s plan is ‘working’ giving them room to do ‘other things’ which will help get the economy moving.

But Dr Fox is clear that the Treasury needs to be bolder.

His key idea is scrapping capital gains tax, currently 28 per cent, for three years, and then bringing it back at a lower rate of 10 per cent.

‘Deficit reduction alone won’t be enough. We have to have a growing economy. We need to shock the system.’

Taking aim at the benefits and welfare system, Dr Fox added: ‘We need to have a look at everything that we have in terms of paternity leave and all the other things that are there.

Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled out making cuts to many pensioner benefits

‘With the sort of economic problems 
that we face in the UK it is irrational and unreasonable to expect that 
those in work should keep all their social benefits and workplace 
benefits should be protected, at the cost of making the next generation 
unemployed.

'That is not a sustainable generational compact.'

He also urged ministers to bring forward the decision no new airport capacity in the South East.

Allies of Mr Osborne insisted the Chancellor was relaxed about Dr Fox’s comments.

Before the election Mr Cameron was clear that benefits for wealthy pensioners would be protected.

‘Let me say very clearly to pensioners if you have a Conservative Government your Winter Fuel Allowance, your bus pass, your Pension Credit, your free TV licence all these things are safe.

'You can read my lips, that is a promise from my heart.’

He has repeated the pledge several times since becoming Prime Minister.

Nothing should be off limits - even the benefits for pensioners which the PM says are protected
