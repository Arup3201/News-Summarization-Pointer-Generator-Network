Lying peacefully in her father’s arms, six-week-old Teresita Medina is the youngest survivor of the horrific Spanish train crash and the only one who will have no clear memory of the devastating ordeal.

The Medina family were travelling from Madrid in the direction of El Ferrol in North Western Spain on the train that derailed last Wednesday, killing 78.

The young family miraculously survived the crash despite their carriage running off the tracks as the train sped around a bend allegedly at 120mph - twice the recommended speed.

Unscathed: Daniel Castro cradles his six-week-old Teresita in his arms as her relieved mother watch on. The family survived the devastating train crash near Santiago de Compostela that killed 78

Yesica Medina told the Sunday Telegraph that her family are alive thanks to some fortuitous timing.

Ms Medina had been pacing the carriage with her crying baby in her arms, trying to soothe her while her husband Daniel Castro and their seven-year-old son Carlos sat in their seats.

When she finally rocked Teresita to sleep, Ms Medina returned to her seat to put the baby down in the cot that the couple had set up beside them.

Just as she sat down, the train crashed. Ms Medina said that had she remained standing, she would have been knocked down by the force of the crash and her baby would have been thrown from her arms.

She insists had she sat down a moment sooner, she would have laid her baby down beside her and she would have been crushed by the force of the crash.

Instead, she remained cradled in her mothers arms in a lucky twist of fate.

She told a Sunday Telegraph reporter: ‘It was as if a guardian angel was watching over us.

‘At the exact moment I sat down, that exact moment, the train lurched on a bend and flew off the tracks.’

Baby Teresita was cushioned by her mother’s arms as their carriage sped off the track, crashed into a concrete wall and fell on its side.

She is left with just a small scratch mark on her thigh to mark what is the country’s worst rail disaster in almost 70 years.

The family were travelling in first class back from a two-day trip in Madrid, after buying tickets that were on offer.

Wreckage: Carriages crashed into the concrete wall and fell over. Yesica Medina and Daniel Castro described how they crawled from the carriage into the smoke and flames outside

Mr Castro said he had to dig his wife
out from under a pile of bags and they managed to crawl to safety from a
hole in the wall of the carriage.

He
said when the scene outside the carriage was devastating- then train’s 
engine was in flames, air was thick with smoke and it was difficult to 
breathe.

Ms Medina said: 
‘People were walking around like zombies. There were bodies lying 
twisted, some trapped beneath carriages, others at windows trying to get
out, all around people were calling out for help.’

The train driver suspected of causing the Spanish rail crash has refused to answer police questions - as the track reopened for the first time yesterday.

Francisco Jose Garzon, 52, who is under armed guard in hospital, is to be questioned over suspected reckless driving following the devastating crash which left almost 170 passengers injured.

Investigators are looking into possible failings by the driver after the Madrid to Ferrol service derailed on Wednesday night as it approached the city of Santiago de Compostela.
