Cleared: Redinel Dervishaj, 35, has been cleared of murder charges following the stabbing death of a groom-to-be outside his engagement party last month

A man who fatally stabbed a groom-to-be during his engagement party will not be indicted on murder charges, a grand jury announced today.

The New York Grand jury reported a lack of evidence to indict 35-year-old Redinel Dervishaj with murder following last month's stabbing of 27-year-old Antonio Lacertosa on Staten Island.

Dervishaj's team argued that the Albanian, currently on an immigration hold on Rikers Island, stabbed Mr Lacertosa with a butcher's knife in self-defense that was captured on camera.

The grand jury reviewed that footage.

'Luckily a lot of it was captured on video,' defense attorney Thomas Reilly said, according to the New York Post.

'Not the actual stabbing,' he added, 'but everything leading up to it.'

Mr Lacertosa was celebrating his September engagement to 24-year-old Bridgette Schneider outside a Staten Island restaurant when the deadly scene unfolded.

Mr Reilly argued Mr Lacertosa's party had become rowdy and were confronted by Dervishaj and restaurant manager Ridi Zeneli when seen urinating on the Espana Restaurant and Lounge's exterior.

According to Mr Reilly, surveillance video showed 'my client getting beaten, thrown over a car. He then runs to his own car to escape and is chased down by six guys who are throwing bottles at him.'

Killed: 27-year-old Antonio Lacertosa was fatally stabbed while celebrating his engagement but a grand jury found it was in self-defense

Proposal: Antonio Lacertosa proposed to his girlfriend Bridgette in December

From there Mr Reilly said they dashed back into the restaurant after fleeing down an alley. Inside, Dervishaj grabbed the knife that would be used to stab Mr Lacertosa, fatally.

'My thoughts and prayers go out to Antonio Lacertosa’s family and to his 
fianceé as they try to cope with the pain of their loss,' Staten Island District 
Attorney Daniel Donovan released in a statement.

'His death was a tragic and senseless end to a night that began as 
a celebration of a young couple’s new life together,' he wrote.

Three days after the March 17th murder, Dervishaj was detained in Palo Hills, Illinois by the local authorities working in tandem with the New York City Police Department.

Dervishaj has a violent past, police records show. In 2007 he was shot in the arm after brawling with Albanian mobsters.

'He was always nasty with an 
attitude,' Dervishaj’s former next-door neighbor, Mike Nuzzolo, 56, told
the New York Daily News. 'He was always yelling and screaming at 
somebody. I kept the windows closed so I wouldn’t have to hear him. He 
was just unpleasant.'

'This guy stabbed me! Call an ambulance!' Mr Lacertosa's last words cried as he clutched his side that fateful night.

Crime scene: The area surrounding the restaurant was cordoned off, with a trail of dried blood stretching across the driveway and blue forensics gloves abandoned in the gutter

Scene: Witnesses said a restaurant worker was seen grabbing a kitchen knife and plunging it into Mr Lacertosa's chest while the jury saw video of a prior chase

His fiancée 
tried to help by administering CPR, and friends used restaurant linens 
to try to absorb the bleeding, but nothing worked.

They put him in a car and began driving to the hospital before flagging down an ambulance that they saw en route.

Mr Lacertosa was taken to Staten Island University Hospital where he later died.

The night started as a celebratory 
one, as Mr Lacertosa and his high school sweetheart Ms Schneider 
gathered with family and friends for a formal engagement dinner.

The group ended up having drinks at a restaurant where an argument apparently broke out with the management staff, according to a police source.

In love: The pair were due to marry in eight months. Lacertosa popped the question in December

Mr Lacertosa's sister, Antonia, told the New York Times that things got heated, with a fight breaking out into the street at around two o'clock on Saturday morning.

She said her brother went outside to see what was going on and was stabbed.

Witnesses added that a worker was 
seen grabbing a kitchen knife and plunging it into Mr Lacertosa’s chest. 
The restaurant manager turned himself into police for questioning.

'He
had everything,' Antonia, 29, said. 'He would have made a great father.
No one would ever say anything bad about my brother.

'He was the greatest. He was a great brother, son, uncle, friend. He was big, and muscular, but he was a teddy bear.'

Long term: Antonio Lacertosa and his fiancee Bridgette were childhood sweethearts, having met at Tottenville High School

The suspect fled the scene, leaving Mr Lacertosa, from the Pleasant Plains neighbourhood of Staten Island, bleeding to death outside.

The area surrounding the restaurant was cordoned off, with a trail of dried blood stretching across the driveway and blue forensics gloves abandoned in the gutter.

Investigators have not yet identified the killer.

Planning now for a funeral instead of a wedding, Mr Lacertosa’s fiancée, Bridgette, was too distraught to talk.

A photo on their wedding website shows a smiling Mr Lacertosa with his arm around a beaming Bridgette.

The couple, who met at Tottenville High School, were shopping for a house in the neighborhood, Mr Lacertosa’s brother said.

The brother added that Mr Lacertosa was 'a good kid. He carried this whole household.'
