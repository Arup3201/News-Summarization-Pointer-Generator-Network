When artist Nicky Philipps last turned her hand to painting royalty, Prince Harry complained his hair was ‘too ginger’.

And Prince William, his brother pointed out, had rather too much hair.

But the Queen, being a model of discretion, is not on record expressing her views on this portrait.

The silver hair, fine robes and jewellery may well escape Her Majesty’s scrutiny, but any reaction by the 87-year-old to the quizzical look on her face will have to be left to speculation.

The monarch’s image was painted by Miss Philipps for a 1st class stamp to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s Coronation.

The specially commissioned artwork was unveiled by the Royal Mail yesterday, along with five other stamps featuring a collection of portraits of Her Majesty.

Appropriately enough, the cost of the first class stamp is 60p.

The oil painting is the result of three sittings with the Queen in the Chinese Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace last year.

In 2009 Miss Philipps painted both Prince William and brother Harry but the end result received mixed reviews.

Harry later said he was ‘more ginger in there than I am in real life’, while the painting was described by one critic at the time as ‘amateurish’.

Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene 
said: ‘Royal Mail is proud to mark the occasion of Her Majesty The 
Queen’s Coronation by commissioning a painted portrait.

Nicky Philipps' portrait of Prince William and Prince Harry - the first painted of the pair - received mixed reviews when it was unveiled in 2010

'This is the first time in our history we have done so.

‘The Queen’s image is one of the most recognisable in the world and we are delighted to bring this portrait along with five others together in a special stamp set to mark the 60th anniversary of her Coronation.'

The other stamps feature work by Terence Cuneo in 1953, Pietro Annigoni in 1955, Richard Stone in 1992, Andrew Festing in 1999 and a 2000 artwork by Russian-born Sergei Pavlenko
