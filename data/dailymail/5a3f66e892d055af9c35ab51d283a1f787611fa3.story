A Colorado judge has today ordered the release of grand jury documents related to the 1996 killing of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey.

Boulder District Attorney spokeswoman Catherine Olguin declined to say whether the documents, which have been sealed since the grand jury was dismissed in 1999, will include an indictment against parents John and Patsy Ramsey.

The Daily Camera previously reported that the grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the Ramseys but then DA Alex Hunter declined to pursue those charges.

JonBenet's body was found bludgeoned and strangled in her family's home in Boulder on December 26, 1996. Former District Attorney Mary Lacy said in 2008 that evidence suggests the killer was a stranger, not a family member.

A reporter for The Camera and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a lawsuit to seek the records.

The news comes just days after JonBenet's father said he didn't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter's case released to the public.

John Ramsey's attorneys sent a letter Monday to the Boulder County District Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the former beauty queen's parents.

Reports earlier this year suggested the secret indictments were of both John and Patricia Ramsey.

John
Ramsey's attorneys argued Monday that to release only the indictments, 
and not the entire grand jury record, would put him at a disadvantage.

'Public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera.

'Mr. Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law,' the letter continued.

'Nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view.'

The move to make the indictments public is an effort between the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a Boulder Daily Camera reporter.

The indictments were earlier this year reported to be of child abuse leading to their daughter's death, according to the paper.

A grand jury voted at the time to go forward with the charges, but the district attorney declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilty without a reasonable doubt, according to the paper.

Sent on John Ramsey's behalf, the letter was in response to a judge ruling last week that found releasing the indictments would not be in violation of grand jury secrecy rules, the paper said.

That judge ordered the current DA to provide reason why it should be kept secret, according to the Daily Camera. He provided them to a judge on Tuesday to determine if they were suitable to be released.

John Ramsey's attorneys argued against this move, saying the father was never contacted about the release of any documents from his daughter's case - adding that without releasing the entire record, the objective will not be achieved.

'The District Court found 'transparency' to be the determinative factor in its order to show cause,' he said the letter. 'Transparency can only be accomplished if the entire record is made public.'

'The court should also order release of the entire grand jury record, including all witness testimony, all exhibits, all colloquy discussions between prosecutors and the grand jury and all drafts of potential indictments presented by the prosecutors of the grand jury,' the letter continues.

Officials responded to the letter by stating they only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired, according to the paper.

The Ramseys were exonerated in 2008 from any responsibility for the girl's death by the then-DA.

The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002.
