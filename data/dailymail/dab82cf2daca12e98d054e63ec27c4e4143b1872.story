Surgeon Dr Gabrielle McMullin says sexism is so rife among surgeons in Australia that young woman who want a career in medicine would do best to 'comply'

Female surgeons are only tolerated in Australian hospitals if they are ‘single, childless and pretend to be men’ a female doctor has claimed, as dozens of women in the male-dominated profession open up about their experiences of sexism.

Following controversial comments by a female senior surgeon who told aspiring female doctors to go along with sexual abuse at work for the sake of their careers, more women have claimed sexual harassment is a ‘major issue’ in the medical profession.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, one female doctor said she was told by a male colleague women were ‘f***ing useless’.

A consultant surgeon instructed her to ‘get some knee pads and learn to suck c**k’ and another senior colleague ensured that she was shunned when she stood up for herself after he inappropriately touched her.

‘They think they own you, a lot of these guys,’ she said.

Other female surgeons, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told how a ‘boys club’ mentality within the profession led to women being ostracised when they complained about sexual harassment.  

In an ABC radio interview on Friday, Dr Gabrielle McMullin, a top vascular surgeon in Sydney, said sexism is so rife among male surgeons in Australian hospitals that young women would do best to grin and bear it.

Her comments follow a warning she issued to young women at Sydney's Parliament House on Friday, during the launch of a book she co-authored on gender equality. 

'What I tell my trainees is that, if you are approached for sex, probably the safest thing to do in terms of your career is to comply with the request,' she said. 

At the  launch of  'Pathways to Gender Equality in Australia' on Friday, Dr McMullin advised female trainees to avoid putting themselves in vulnerable situations. But giving in to unwanted sexual advances is easier than pursuing perpetrators, she warned, because the sexism is so entrenched.

Dr McMullin told ABC's AM program the story of Dr Caroline Tan, a young doctor who won a sexual harassment case in 2008 against a surgeon who forced himself on her while she was training at a Melbourne Hospital. 

Dr Tan didn't tell anyone what had happened until the surgeon started giving her reports that were so bad they threatened the career she had worked so hard for.

But McMullin warns complaining to the supervising body is the 'worst thing' trainees could do.

'Despite that victory, she has never been appointed to a public position in a hospital in Australasia,' she said of the case. 'Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex on this night.'

'And realistically, she would have been much better to have given him a blow-job on that night.'

Dr McMullin's comments have been roundly criticised by others in the medical profession, women's rights and sexual abuse support groups as 'appalling.'

Many social media users are angry at Dr McMullin's comments and have taken to Facebook to express their disgust

The president of the Australian Medical Association of Victoria,  Dr Tony Bartone, 'strongly disagrees' with Dr McMullin's advice.

'This old view of acceptance needs to be eradicated,' he told Fairfax media. 'Sexual assault is a crime and will not be tolerated by our society. The medical profession is not exempt from this maxim.'

Despite the attacks, Dr McMullin stood by her comments on Saturday, saying her advice was practical and true, and it was offered because she is 'so frustrated with what is going on.'

The public response on social media has been mixed, with many in the community expressing dismay at the remarks.

'We live in a world where we want our girls to have an education so they can have a career and they can look after themselves independently. I sure am saddened by these comments,' wrote one facebook user. 

But responses from the community have been mixed

Many Facebook  users have also come out in support of Dr McMullin for exposing the sexism

But many others have applauded Dr McMullin for drawing attention to the pervasive nature of sexual harassment at work.

'I think the problem is that she's probably right. This behaviour is not limited to surgeons, it pervades so many professional fields,' writes one Facebook user. 

'Don't shoot the messenger, fix the situation!' said another. 'If anyone would know how things work in that system, it would be someone in her position.'

Dr McCullin has told Fairfax she's received many phone calls since Friday from women to say 'thank you.' 

'It's been hidden and suppressed for so long and it's only when it comes out in the open that you can do something about it. So, I guess this is my attempt to air it,' she said. 

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2011, surgeons were predominately male, with the vast majority (94 per cent) of orthopaedic surgeons, and around nine in ten vascular (89 per cent) and cardiothoracic (88 per cent) surgeons being men.

Only 25 per cent of surgery trainees in Australia are women.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2011, surgery is still a male dominated profession
