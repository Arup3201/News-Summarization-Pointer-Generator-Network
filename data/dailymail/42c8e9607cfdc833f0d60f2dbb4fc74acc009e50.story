A football fan is facing a lengthy jail term after biting a chunk off his girlfriendâ€™s ear following England's World Cup defeat to Italy, a court has heard.

David Barr, 38, stayed up late drinking with girlfriend Gemma Dykins, 29, to watch England's opening game on TV last month.

Barr then launched a vicious attack on Miss Dykins and bit a chunk out of her left ear, a court heard today.

Prosecutor Matthew Ellis said Barr launched his drunken assault around midnight after he snatched Miss Dykins' mobile phone from her to look at her messages.

Mr Ellis said: 'He followed her to the kitchen and was very angry. His fists were clenched and he was shouting at her.

'Barr punched her hard to the left side of her face, she hit her head on the tiled floor and lost consciousness.

'He knelt down over her and bit her left ear and she felt a sharp pain and there was a lot of blood.'

The court heard Barr, of Mold, North Wales, then strangled his girlfriend until she couldn't breathe, leading her to feared she might be killed.

Mr Ellis said print works manager Barr then calmed down and later carried Miss Dykins upstairs.

The following morning Barr called the ambulance and Miss Dykins was found to have a fractured jaw, bruising and part of her left ear bitten off.

Mold Crown Court heard the couple initially claimed Miss Dykins had fallen over the dog and the matter wasn't reported to police.

But a concerned friend contacted officers when she saw the state Miss Dykins was in.

Barr admitted a charge of unlawful wounding and wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.

He will be sentenced next month and was told to expect a lengthy custodial sentence.

Police launched a crackdown on domestic abusers during the World Cup after research showed violence soars following matches - even when England win.

Forces across Britain drafted in extra resources last month after launching hard-hitting poster campaigns and even paying personal visits to known offenders.

A study showed domestic incidents increase by more than a third when England loses a World Cup match - but also rise by 26 per cent when the team wins.

Campaign: Lancashire Police have released these posters to raise awareness during the World Cup

In Essex, 117 fans, seven of them women, were handed warnings after officers analysed their history of domestic and footballing crime.

A similar tactic was employed in Northumbria, where officers paid 'special attention' to people who are known to be a risk.

Researchers from Lancaster University examined crime figures from Lancashire Police during the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and found there was more violence on days when England played.
