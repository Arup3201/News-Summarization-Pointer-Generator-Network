Finn Harvey Schneider, whose real name was Raymond Fairclough used 17 different names to claim a range of benefits and continue working 

A fraudster who changed his name 17 times to claim a £47,000 in benefits received a suspended jail sentence. 

Finn Harvey Schneider, 47, from Osgathorpe, Leicestershire, used bogus names such as Rai River Croft and Zachary Caleb Maxillian to earn up to £1,000 a week working odd jobs, while claiming benefits at the same time.

Leicester Crown Court heard how Schneider changed the names on his driving licence more than 12 times to keep up with his 'sophisticated' frauds and lived in a 'fantasy world'.

Schneider's original name is believed to have been Raymond Fairclough and over the past five years he has created 17 different personas for himself.

He even changed his name to Rai River Croft since his arrest.

The court heard how Schneider was claiming benefits including a carer's allowance, job seekers' allowance, disability living allowance, social fund payments and incapacity benefit under one name but working and earning up to £1,000 a week in various other names.

Schneider pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue out of £42,042 by fraudulently claiming a variety of benefits by using false names, between March 2007 and October 2012.

In 2009, Schneider claimed disability living allowance because he claimed he had depression, was awaiting a hip operation, was liable to self-harm, suffered panic attacks and needed a full-time carer.

But it turned out Schneider was actually working and earning money at the same time.

Schneider also admitted failing to notify Oadby and Wigston Borough Council of a change in circumstances, when claiming housing and council tax benefits, totalling £5,088, between April 2009 and October 2012.

Leicester Crown Court was told Schneider was suffering from mental problems, including a personality disorder, which could have contributed to his criminal behaviour.

He was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years.

Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: 'It seems to some extent you live in a fantasy world relating to your identity.

'I don't know if you're pulling the wool over everyone's eyes or not, or whether in truth you suffered abuse in childhood, or suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, or other disorders, as referred to in the psychiatric report, such as depression and anxiety.

'It would be inappropriate for me to make a finding that the psychiatric report is wrong.

'You were a persistent and rather sophisticated fraudster who managed to obtain over £40,000 in benefits you weren't entitled to.

'It may be part of your offending is a product of your personality disorder; a product of the person you are, rather than calculated criminality - it's very hard to say.'

Simon Worlock, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown traced 17 names having been used, but not all of those were done during the period of offending.

'He obtained changes in names on driving licences and got new National Insurance numbers.'

Olwen Davies, mitigating, said Schneider's mental health issues 'go back a long time', prior to the offending.

'His change of names is accounted for by his psychiatric illness.

'He's suffered poetic justice as officials will only deal with him in his original name of Fairclough, and he no longer has those papers and can't claim benefits.'

She said he was subject to a 'refund system' which means he would be repaying the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) until 2050.

The judge also placed Schneider on a Financial Reporting Order, under the 2005 Serious Organised Crime Police Act, for 10 years.

It means he must report annually to an officer of the DWP with full details of his income, current P45 or P60 and evidence of his name and address.
