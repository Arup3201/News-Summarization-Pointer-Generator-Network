After one Premier League, four FA Cups, a League Cup and the Champions League, Ashley Cole looks to have played his last game for Chelsea.

The left-back has tweeted he's weighing up his options for next season and he doesn't believe the west Londoners will be one of them.

But where will he end up? Many would argue the 33-year-old would improve the first teams of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.

So, we decided to ask the fan websites of those teams - even former club Arsenal - whether they would like to sign the recently-retired England international.

LIVERPOOL

David Tyrer: Live4Liverpool

If you were to ask any Liverpool fan whether they'd take Cole, even on a free transfer, the resounding answer would be 'no!' There's something eminently unlikeable about Cole.

But given some time, you can see the sense in it: he's vastly experienced, won it all (many times) and his game doesn't rely on speed or pace so, at 33, you'd get two or three more years out of him.

And, given his recent retirement from England duty, he'd be fully focused on the job.

We may not like it, but he'd be a quality acquisition and save us a fortune.

MANCHESTER UNITED

Dale O'Donnell: Stretty News

The transformation of full-backs in the last 10-15 years has seen their job description change from not only being able to defend well, but to get forward effectively too.

Cole was one of the pioneers of attacking full-back play, but after eight successful years at Chelsea, he is now in search of a new club. It will most likely be his last.

The 33-year-old is a fine example of a modern day full-back, but his best days are long gone.

Which is why Manchester United are looking increasingly likely to sign Luke Shaw, who is without doubt the most promising full-back England has seen since Cole broke onto the scene at Arsenal.

There are also ongoing discussions to keep Patrice Evra at the club for another year. The former French captain is a better role model, on and off the pitch, for Shaw to learn under.

MANCHESTER CITY

Steven Allweis: View From a Blue

In the final stages of last season, Cole demonstrated that he still retains the competitive edge and defensive instinct to compete at a decent level.

But the reality is that if he weren’t English, there would be no rumours linking him with City.

However, such is our need to adhere to the quotas, there has been the odd mention about his possible arrival.

Will it happen? I very much doubt it. Would I like it to happen? Again, probably not.

He has his uses and I’m sure he’ll be a good short-term signing for someone, but he’s no better going forward than Aleks Kolarov, whose place in the squad he would likely take.

Left-back is not City’s strongest position, but I’m far from convinced a 33-year-old Ashley Cole is the answer.

ARSENAL

Peter Wood: Le Grove

Ashley Cole back to Arsenal? On the face of it, it’s a no. The man is an odious blight on the memory of most Arsenal fans.

But then I think about why he might be leaving Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, out of the Premier League game for six years has come back and he’s proved he is now the 'specialist in failure'.

Cole wants to win trophies on the back nine of his career. Mourinho hasn’t won anything for two years, he’s upsetting players, selling his best names, looking and sounding like a bit of a nutter, choking with an incredible squad… Ashley probably wants to move London’s most trophy-laden club this season.

I’d take him back as a reserve, providing he promised not to crash his Bentley when he sees the pay-as-you-play contract I’d have on offer.
