House-proud Daily Mail readers have told of their delight at beating the EU ban by hoovering up high-powered vacuum cleaners in our special promotion.

Among the first to bag one was businessman Roger Hunt, who says his Hoover Spirit Pets Cylinder will be ideal for keeping the five-bedroom home spick and span. 

He lives there with wife Jane, their four children and four-year-old cocker spaniel, Tennyson, spick and span.

Versatile: Businessman, Roger Hunt, says his Hoover is great for cleaning cars as well as the house

Yesterday Mr Hunt, 54, of Worcester, who has run his own second-hand car business for 35 years, said: ‘It’s lightweight so we can take it up and down the stairs easily and run it round the house.

‘It’s got attachments so you can get down the sofa and clear dog hairs, and it will do any surface, carpets or tiling. In my opinion, the Hoover is so good I’ll also be bringing it to work to use it on the cars.’

In a blow to families and pet owners who value powerful vacuums for making house cleaning quick and easy, a European Union directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts came into force this week in an attempt to reduce energy use.

The Mail teamed up with Hoover to offer readers an exclusive 50 per cent off two top Hoover vacuum cleaners – the Hoover Spirit Pets, which Mr Hunt ordered, for £74.99 including postage (normally £149.99), or the Hoover Breeze Pets for £99.99 including postage (normally £199.99). 

Both the models originally on offer sold out within just five hours. But today we are offering two different high-powered models to readers (see offer below).

Mr Hunt said: ‘We wanted a high-power vacuum cleaner and every one of my generation knows Hoover are a good product so as soon as we saw the offer in the Daily Mail we knew it was the one for us.

‘I cannot understand why the ban is coming in. With a high-powered one like this you use it once a week and get the job done properly. 

With lower powered models you end up using them maybe three or four times a week to get the same result.’

Mrs Hunt, 44, works as a service adviser for another car dealership, so fitting in efficient housework in limited time between work is essential for the busy couple.

Three of their children – Harry, 18, Patsy, 15, and Archie, 12 – still live at home full-time, while the fourth, Georgina, 20, is at university.

Another to take advantage of our promotion was Misty Taylor, 86, of Rhyl, Denbighshire, who opted for the upright Breeze Pets model.

The grandmother said: ‘I’ve had Hoovers since 1949, they are reliable and you need the power to do a good job. I wouldn’t be without one.’

The EU ban led to a stampede to buy powerful vacuum cleaners in shops this with week, with retailers reporting a fourfold surge in sales.

Retailers can continue selling stock until it runs out but they cannot import more and manufacturers can no longer make them.

From next year the EU ban will extend to vacuums cleaners of 900 watts as well.
