Sir Alex Ferguson showed it is the season of goodwill as he spared the time to shake hands and speak with a Manchester beggar.

The meeting occurred when Ferguson was walking outside of the 47 King Street West restaurant in Manchester city centre, where he had lunch with a group of friends.

The former Manchester United manager was approached by the wheelchar-bound supplicator, affectionately known by locals as 'Scouse'.

Wearing a bobble hat resembling the colours of Fergie's former rivals Manchester City, the Scot was pictured sharing a few words with 'Scouse' - possibly to tell him he would have preferred the hat in red.

Carrying out his good deed of the day, the brief meeting lasted only a few moments before Ferguson was whisked away in a car.
