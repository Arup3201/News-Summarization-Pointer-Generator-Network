Rock legend Jimmy Barnes was caught inside a bomb scare this afternoon when a major hospital was evacuated.

The Cold Chisel singer was forced to evacuate from the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick along with the Royal North Shore hospital following the scare. Police are still investigating the incident.

'They just rushed us out, they had to pull all of the drips out and everything,' he said, showing where they had removed the drips from his arm.

Barnes says he was rushed out of the hospital after they heard about the threat, with the the drips pulled from his arms

But despite the grave circumstances, Barnes and his wife, Jane, were in good spirits, joking that he 'had a few years left in me, yet'.

Barnes is in hospital receiving recovering from back surgery. He is an eminent figure in the Australian rock scene, releasing nine albums that made the Australian top ten throughout his career. He recorded 14 Top 40 Albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums in Australia.

Barnes explained he had had undergone back surgery, and then offerred the bag of his spinal fluid as a gesture of good will.

'Here's a bit of spinal fluid if you want some.' 

Barnes was spotted by Daily Mail with his wife Jane and a friend. He was believed to be chatting to his daughter Susie on the phone, when he looked up and said:

'I've got to go go now, there's a bloke here trying to get some footage of me. He's a very friendly fellow, but he could lose his film if the bomb goes off.'

Jimmy Barnes showed a bag he claimed was his 'spinal fluid' outside the hospital, but in a picture he posted on Twitter (above) he wrote 'anyone for brain fluid?'

In a more sombre tone, Barnes acknowledged that it was a serious incident: 

'What a stupid thing to happen, it's very serious. There's a lot of sick people in these hospitals.'

He also believed that there could be more of this to come.

'This is going to happen. There's a lot of foolish people around. Hopefully we don't see any more of this sort of stuff happening.'

It comes as Tony Abbott has raised the terror threat in Australia to high for the first time in history, a move which will see heightened security at airports, public events, and government building. The new security measures mean a terrorism attack is now considered likely.
