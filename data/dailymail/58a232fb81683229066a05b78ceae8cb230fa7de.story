Do you find yourself checking your phone every few seconds, waiting for the ping of an email or the beep of a text?

If so, chances are that you’re an addict. And as with all addictions, the best thing to do is seek treatment.

Luckily, the first digital device detox centre to rehabilitate phone and internet addicts has sprung up in the Welsh countryside.

Unplugged Weekend is designed as a digital detox for people stressed out with lives attached to their phones, and includes activities such as life drawing, hiking and yoga

Aptly called ‘Unplugged Weekend’, it is nestled in the heart of the Brecon Beacons and runs festival-style weekends to help phone obsessives reconnect with real life.

The camp-style set-up, which is imported from the US where it has taken off, is designed to help wean addicts off their devices and discover nature.

But deliverance from your digital demons doesn’t come cheap. A weekend at the retreat in the Brecon Beacons will set you back £199.

However, for many parents with teenagers who are constantly glued to their phones, it may be the best option, given worrying statistics on phone use.

Last week, communications watchdog Ofcom revealed that we spend nearly nine hours a day using our smartphones, laptops, tablets and other devices.

Other stats show that we check our phones an average of 150 times a day, according to a Nokia survey.

The rehab begins on a Friday with everyone dropping their smartphones into a black trunk which is passed around the group.

Set in the Brecon Beacons in Wales, the retreat begins with everyone handing over their phones which are kept in a locked black box until they leave again

Days at the retreat begin with yoga and meditation at 7am, followed by a ‘group sharing experience’ in which everyone talks about their addiction.

Life drawing, rambling walks through the Beacons and laughter therapy are just a few of the activities on offer to help distract visitors from their phones.

Describing the weekend, the website says: ‘Unplugged Weekend is a digital detox set in the countryside, so we’ll all be locking away our phones for a couple of days while we get on with having a good time.

‘We will do a group phone surrendering ceremony on the Friday evening to mark the start of the weekend and you will be reunited with your devices on Sunday when you leave. This is a tech free weekend.’

The rehab centre was set up by Lucy Pearson, 26, and Vikki Bates, 28, from London, after they met on a retreat in the Sahara desert earlier this year.

Unable to use their phones due to lack of signal, the advertising workers realised how liberating it was and quit their jobs to start the retreat.

‘Being in the middle of the dunes, we didn't have any phone signal for a week- it was great. That's when we realised the benefits of having a break from being constantly tuned in,’ they said.

Research shows that on average people now spend more time per day on digital devices than they do on sleep

‘So when we got back to London we put our heads together and Unplugged was born.’

‘We realised that the differentiating thing about our experience [in the Sahara] was that we didn’t have our phones and nobody was chasing us for anything,’ Miss Bates told the Times.

‘You’re so caught up in the stress of life and you’re thinking all the time but not about the important stuff - like whether you’re happy.’

One visitor to the centre, Tilly, who has just finished her first year at Cambridge University, told the Times: ‘You realise how much of a social barrier having a phone is.

‘Any time I’m anxious in a social situation I get my phone out and pretend to play a game or reply to all these text messages I’m supposed to have got, but because you can’t do that here you actually talk to people.’

Another visitor, Tracey, said: ‘The first thing I do in the morning is check Facebook in bed, then I get distracted and I can be on it for hours without realising.'
