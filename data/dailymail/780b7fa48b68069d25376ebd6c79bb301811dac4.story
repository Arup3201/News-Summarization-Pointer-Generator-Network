A knife-wielding robber fashioned a disguise for himself by cutting eye holes into a carrier bag and putting it on his head.

The man wore a white Londis plastic bag during the bizarre raid, which was caught on CCTV and terrified a lone female shop worker in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.

Police have now released footage of the incident in the hope they can track down the bag-wearing suspect.

A head for disguises: A knife-wielding robber wore a white Londis plastic bag on his head during a bizarre raid

Terrifying: The man pulled a knife on the surprised shop worker and helped himself to cash from the till

The footage shows the man walking into a Day One store in Bennetts Gate, Hemel Hempstead, at 8.45am on May 9.

With his eyes - and at one point his nose - poking out from gaps in the bag, he walked to the wine aisle while the shop worker was serving another customer.

Once the customer had left he suddenly pulled out the knife, which appeared to be a few inches long, and demanded cash from the stunned worker.

He helped himself to money from the till before dashing off, leaving the worker shocked but unhurt.

So far police have been unable to find the suspect, and the incident featured last night on the BBC's Crimewatch in a bid to track him down.

DC Paula Mowbray, from the Local Crime
 Unit at Hemel Hempstead Police Station, said: 'This was a distressing 
incident for the owner of the store and we continue to make efforts to 
identify this man.

'It’s an unusual choice of disguise and clearly parts of his face are still on display which is why we’re releasing this footage in the hope that someone will know who he is.

'If you believe you can identify this man please make contact as soon as possible.'

Stunned CCTV viewers poked fun at the robber on the Herts Police Facebook page.

Paula Thomas said: 'Shouldn’t laugh but really! What a complete muppet.'

Kate Cornelius added: 'Man could not 
find a bag big enough to put himself in. Rubbish to be found and 
discarded in the nearest prison!'

And Mark Dorsett said: 'Times are desperate'.
