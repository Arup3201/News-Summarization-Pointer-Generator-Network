A lesbian couple is taking an Vermont town to court claiming they have faced ten years of harassment, including anonymous bullying, unjust fines and dead animals being dumped on their lawn.

The couple, Barbara Ernst and Barbara Supeno, from Addison, are suing for what they allege is more than a decade of discrimination.

Their lawyer, David Bond, says the town has tried to push couple out since they moved there in 2004.

Bond said: 'It's entirely based on their sexual orientation.

'Neighbours insulted them, made obscene gestures to them.

'There were dead animals left on their property.'

The couple are seeking both peace, and damages for their suffering, and they don't want to have to move to get it.

According to WPTZ, among some of the alleged grievances is the incidence of the
 women’s property, which is next to Lake Champlain, being the topic of 
discussion at two zoning meetings, with their lawyer claiming they were 
never informed.

The complaint also said the couple filed numerous issues with the town 
regarding neighbors and zoning regulation, but that the town purposely
 refused to respond.

Graffiti in the town that the couple claim was discriminatory and directed at them, for which they are suing for damages

After the women, who have been partners for 21 years, had been receiving regular threats, they put up a 
fence in 2008, which their Lawyer claimed fit in with the town's requirements, 
but two meetings were held about the fence without Ernst or Supeno's 
knowing.

Another issue 
occurred when the town refused to allow a handicap ramp to be set up at 
the home for Supeno's mother, with clerks saying she had to accept the 
town's judgement or face a $100 fine.

Mr
 Bond also said that his clients had been intimidated by anonymous 
bullying, after a letter circulated through the town in 2011 saying that
 they were con artists.  

The
 letter was titled 'The truth about The Barbaras' and read: 'It has been
 over 6 years that the Subject two women have been passing themselves 
off as involved citizens and very concerns about the town direction and 
in particular with Zoning, the school and the environment.

'Beware: This is a totally phony perception that they have fabricated is a front to cover their devious and vicious behavior.'

A
 year later, a Middlebury lawyer received a letter purportedly from 
Ernst and Supeno claiming the couple would not pay him for his services.The
 letter read: 'We just thought we would give you a heads up as to our 
past games with previous attorneys in the state of VT and also lawyers 
in Middlebury.

'We love to play head games with them and give them a run for their money.

The case filed against senior members of the town, who the couple have named and shamed as people involved in a pattern of discrimination due to their sexuality

Ernst and Supeno have denied that they ever sent the letter.

After
 that, a homophobic slur was spray-painted outside of the town offices, 
and Ernst and Supeno believe it was directed towards them. 

The lawsuit was filed by Ernst and Supeno last week, naming the head of their local zoning committee and Baptist minister, Jeff Kaufmann, as a co-defendant in the case.

The lawsuit also includes two neighbours as co-defendants, and outlines six grievances, including defamation and discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Gay marriage is currently legal in Vermont, which has meant that the claims have come as a shock to many onlookers, as it is seen as a progressive state.

The statute took effect in 2009, allowing same-sex couples to wed in the northeastern state, which was also the first to allow civil unions in the U.S. back in 2000.

Bond said: 'Their hope is this lawsuit will change things.

'Civil rights laws are very favorable in recognizing in that there shouldn't be discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation and they never expected they would be moving into this hotbed of hatred.'

The six counts named in the complaint are defamation, false light 
invasion of privacy, tortuous interference with prospective business 
relations, sexual orientation discrimination, common law retaliation and
 violations of common benefits clause.
