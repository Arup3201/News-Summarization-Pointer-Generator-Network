While her sister attended the first day of Royal Ascot with the Queen, Princess Beatrice travelled to West Yorkshire to greet the Olympic flame.

Marking day 32 of its tour around Britain and Ireland the torch arrived at Harewood House in Leeds.

The young royal took to the steps of the stately home to meet Janet Baker, 33, who was nominated as torchbearer for the time and dedication she puts into charity fundraising.

The torch made a mile-long journey down the driveway to the front of the 18th century home, where it was greeted by the Duke of York’s 23-year-old daughter along with the Earl and Countess of Harewood.

Miss Baker said: 'Coming up that drive, it was absolutely amazing - 
just walking through the ticket booths and then seeing the crowds start 
to get thicker and thicker.

'And with everybody stood on the steps waiting, it was, like, wow.'

Asked what the Princess said to her, Miss Baker said: 'Hello. Welcome - and how proud she was seeing me do it.'

Today was Princess Beatrice's second involvement in 2012 events as she also ran in the Olympic Park race at the Stratford stadium in March.

Tuesday's relay is travelling 150 
miles from Hull to York through Brough, Goole, Camblesforth, Selby, Monk Fryston, Barkston Ash, Tadcaster, Boston Spa, Wetherby, Harewood, Knaresborough, Harrogate and Ripon.

Olympic showjumper and racehorse 
trainer, Harvey Smith will them ride with the flame into York Racecourse as 
the final torchbearer of the day.

The
torch began the day at The Deep aquarium, in Hull, which is home to more than 3,500 fish. Erica Hughes, 72, from Pocklington, was nominated as the first torchbearer for her voluntary work with a team of medics at a clinic in Nepal.

Lewis Birkinshaw, 17, Bradford Academy's current citizen of the year, will carry the torch at World Heritage Site Fountains Abbey in Ripon.

Other torchbearers include George Stocker, 13, from Fairfield, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October 2008. He had 48 weeks of chemotherapy and has gone on to raise £50,000 for Candlelighters charity.

Clive Warley, 74, is carrying the 
flame through his home town of York. He was born with spina bifida and 
supports the Paralympics and special Olympic sports at local, regional 
and national level.

Mr Smith, 74, will ride the final furlong of York Racecourse on showjumper Paddy before lighting the celebration cauldron. Smith,
often a controversial character during his equestrian career, competed 
in two Olympic Games and won an individual bronze medal at the 1970 
World Championships.

Beatrice spent about 20 minutes chatting to families waiting for the torch, telling them how pleased she was to be at the event. Lord Harewood said: 'It’s a great honour for the Olympic Torch to come here, obviously.

'A
lot of people here. A lot of kids here. For us I think that’s the most 
important thing - to engage schoolchildren, engage the next generation 
with all the good things there are about the Olympics. A beautiful place like this, it’s great to see people enjoying being here and enjoying being part of the Olympics too.'

Lord
Harewood welcomed children from 13 local schools to the grounds to take
part in sports events and Beatrice presented the prizes. He added: 'Being awarded your school sports prize by a real princess, it doesn’t get better than that, does it?'

A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on July 27.
