A concert pianist had demanded that a review of a 2010 concert he gave be removed from internet search results under the European 'right to be forgotten' law.

Dejan Lazic, a performer from Croatia, said that a 'defamatory' review of his performance in Washington, D.C. should not appear alongside Google searches for his name because it is 'opinionated' and 'mean-spirited'.

Lazic wrote to the Washington Post, which published the review by classical music writer Anne Midgette, to have the article removed from search results.

Complaint: Dejan Lazic, a Croatian concert pianist, demanded that the Washington Post remove a review of a concert he gave four years ago from search results

He called the review: 'Defamatory, mean-spirited, opinionated, one-sided, offensive [and] simply irrelevant for the arts' - despite the fact that the original piece is in many places complimentary.

In the original article, Midgette said that his performance was lackluster given his huge talents, and prone to 'grandiloquence'.

She wrote: 'It's not that Lazic isn't sensitive - or profoundly gifted... The sheer technical ability was, at first, a delight.

'Soon, though, all of the finesse started to seem like an end in itself... There were fine moments, but they stubbornly refused to add up to anything more than a self-conscious display of Fine Moments.'

Lazic insisted that his request was 'nothing to do with censorship', but a response to the fact that newspaper reviews are 'too far from the truth'.

'Defamed': Lazic - who denies he is trying to censor his history - said the review was 'mean-spirited' and 'opinionated'

He was attempting to invoke a European Union law which regulates search engines and lets EU citizens request to have links removed from search results if the information is deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or… excessive.'

However, the request was misplaced as search engines themselves, not publishers, enact the law. The Post said the request was a 'troubling' example of the rules in action. 

The request was the first the Washington Post has ever received, according to the publisher.

Lazic insisted his request 'has nothing to do with censorship', but complained that he thinks reviews are usually 'too far from the truth'.

Search engines - chiefly Google - fought the ruling in the European courts, but was forced to comply and has removed links to outlets including the BBC, the Telegraph and the MailOnline.

Since then thousands of articles have been removed from hundreds of publishers, which received a notification that their pages will no longer appear on European versions of search engine sites.

In some cases the complaints have been made not be the primary subject of an article but by those mentioned in passing, or even people who have left comments underneath stories which they want hidden.
