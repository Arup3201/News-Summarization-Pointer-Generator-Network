Sniffing extraordinaires, dogs are known for their ability to suss out something by giving it a once-over.

But this trick had them stumped.

In a unique video that is sweeping the internet, more than 50 confused canines are seen gazing dumb-founded at a GoPro camera on a pole.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Curious: Mitch Bergsma, from Texas, captured a variety of dogs trying to work out what a camera is

Sniff: They each have their own approach to tackle the task but all lunge in with their nose to start with

For all they know, the black camera stuck in the ground on a pole is a toy. Or even a strange plant.

And each one has their own approach to sussing out what this knew object is.

With humans off in the background, the clips are a glimpse into each dog's own world that human videos rarely capture.

All of them make eye contact with the lens before making their move.

Own world: Humans are off in the background as these canines peer dumb-founded into the lens

Bored: Some, however, seem less than impressed by the project, as this one lets out a dramatic yawn

Some are apprehensive as they peer stoically at the camera.

Thankfully, GoPro cameras, often used for action shots, are made to be durable as some of the dogs fearlessly slam their slobbery noses onto the lens.

One terrier seems to have worked it out as he delightedly performs for the camera.

But another appears bored by the whole process, yawning dramatically.

Captured by Texan surfer and video blogger Mitch Bergsma, the result is a four-minute collection of some of the internet's most heart-warming canine clips. And within hours it is already a hit on YouTube.

One person commented: 'Wonderful movie!'

Another said: 'This is so cool!'

Cute: The video shows them up-close - possibly closer than many people would care to get with a slobbery dog

Indignant: This terrior glares angrily at the apparatus as he stops playing with another dog to examine it

Others picked up on the drooling: 'How many gallons of lens cleaner did you end up using??'

And
 most were smitten by the pets on show, desperate to get one of their 
own, with one commenter asking: 'What kind of dog is 1.05? I'm loving 
how he/she looks.'

Mr Bergsma, from Austin, Texas, has been making videos for years, with his work regularly posted by the GoPro team on their Facebook page.

Gang: There may be three of them but curiosity leaves them standing still in the water mid-play

Surfing: Many of surfer Mr Bergsma's shots show dogs on a surf board or in the water

Despite being 90 per cent deaf, Mr Bergsma has been praised for his choice of music synced with the shots

Despite being 90 per cent deaf, he is praised by viewers for his choice of music, which is timed perfectly with the shots.

On his website he explains: 'I use American/English sign language. I can only hear 10 per cent in my left ear.

'I can hear everything if I wear the hearing aid but I prefer it off most of the time! I use it with subwoofer to edit the videos with the music. I canâ€™t understand the words when I listen to the music.'
