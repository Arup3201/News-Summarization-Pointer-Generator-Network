David Cameron today held an extraordinary meeting with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani to seek help in defeating ISIS militants. 

It is the first face-to-face talks for 35 years between the leaders of the two countries which have been at loggerheads over Tehran's nuclear policy.

However, Mr Cameron made clear that a global alliance is needed to tackle the rise of ISIS, as he prepares to recall Parliament on Friday for a vote on RAF air strikes in Iraq.

As Mr Cameron sought to enlist Mr Rouhani's backing for the international coalition against ISIS, the Iranian posted a picture of the two of them shaking hands on his Twitter feed.

As the talks got underway, Mr Rouhani tweeted a photograph with a message urging 'constructive engagement'.

Earlier it emerged the US told Iran of its plans to strike ISIS militants inside Syria in order to reassure them that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be targetted.

The communication appears to signal a cooling in hostilities between the U.S. and Iran for the first time since a 1979 hostage crisis prompted Washington to sever ties with Tehran.

Iran is said to have voiced concerns for the safety of Assad, who remains the Shia Islam-dominated nation's closest regional ally and the recipient of Iranian military support during a Syrian Civil War.

Mr Cameron is also backing a sweeping new UN resolution tabled by the US, which would impose global travel bans on foreign fighters planning to join conflicts overseas.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to be fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

Interviewed on NBC News, Mr Cameron said the ISIS group posed a direct threat to Britain.

'These people want to kill us,' he said. They've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.'

The move comes amid growing Tory criticism of Britain's cautious response to the threat posed by IS, which has murdered three Western hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning. 

Labour's shadow cabinet held an emergency meeting at its party conference in Manchester to agree a position on backing air strikes. 

Mr Cameron is desperate to avoid a repeat of last year's damaging Commons defeat over air strikes against Syria and will be looking for Labour support in the vote.

With the shadow cabinet meeting in Manchester at the end of the Labour Party conference to discuss its position, Ed Miliband said he would consider any request from the Prime Minister 'very seriously'.

'Isil is a threat that cannot be ignored,' he told the BBC. 'If a proposition comes forward for military action by the UK, obviously we are open to it and will look at it.'

Tonight Mr Cameron will hold talks with his Iraqi counterpart Haider Abadi which are likely to see a formal request from the Baghdad government for the UK to join the US-led military strikes on the terror group.

With ministers making clear that Mr Cameron will honour his pledge to give MPs a vote before embarking on air strikes, it is thought they could be summoned back to Westminster as early as Friday.

A formal request from the Iraqi government would give the Prime Minister - currently attending the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York - the legal cover he believes is needed to go ahead.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned Parliament must 'step up' and authorise British airstrikes against Islamist extremists.

In the Government's most forthright call yet for the UK to join the bombing campaign, the Cabinet minister said MPs must vote to help repel brutal jihadists rampaging across the Middle East.

He said it was vital Britain helped defeat the terror threat in Syria and Iraq, which he described as the 'new Battle of Britain'.

But he said crushing the so-called Islamic State, formerly called ISIL, which has carried out beheadings, crucifixions and massacres, would be a 'long haul' which could take 'years'.

Mr Fallon spoke out during a visit to British troops running the new Afghan National Army Officers' Acadamy in Kabul – dubbed 'Sandhurst in the Sand'.

His trip came as pressure mounted on David Cameron to act after US president Barack Obama launched air strikes against jihadist targets in Syria alongside a coalition of Arab countries on Monday.

Until now, the RAF has limited its operations to delivering arms and equipment to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, humanitarian aid and surveillance missions in the skies above northern Iraq.

Britain has six RAF Tornado fighter-bombers based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus armed with fearsome Brimstone missiles and Paveway IV bombs which can fly within minutes.

Mr Fallon told the Mail: 'We want to help the international effort and the moderate Arab countries, we want to help support them to help the Iraqi government.

'The pressure is now on our Parliament. It is parliament that needs to step up and decide whether they are prepared to endorse military action and we will be testing that very soon.'

Conservative MPs have warned that Mr Cameron's failure to launch air strikes in Iraq and Syria has left the UK weakened.

More than 130 jihadists were killed in Monday's US-led attacks focused on the ISIL stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. 

Mr Fallon suggested British troops could be deployed in the Middle East to train Iraqi troops but warned the fight against IS could be a 'long-haul'. He said: 'It's not simply a question of helping the Kurds recover the ground and towns that they've lost but to drive ISIL out of Iraq is clearly going to take months and possibly years.

'But that has to be done with international help, with help from other Arab countries, and it has to be done on the ground as well as in the air, but on the ground it has to be done by Iraqi-led forces.'

In comments to the Spectator magazine, Mr Fallon said: 'We've had attacks on the streets of London, on our transport system, at Glasgow Airport, the murder of Lee Rigby – how much more evidence do you need that this is a very clear and dangerous threat to our way of life and to all the democracies of the West? This is a new Battle of Britain.'
