The Medical Innovation Bill was launched by Lord Saatchi after his wife Josephine Hart (both pictured in 2011) died from ovarian cancer

A new law allowing dying patients to be treated with untested medicines has moved a step closer after the Government backed the plan.  

The Medical Innovation Bill aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options.

The Bill was launched by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi after his wife Josephine Hart died from ovarian cancer.

Now Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has thrown his department's weight behind a backbench bill which will be debated in Parliament this week. 

A change in the law would allow doctors to try other treatments deemed reasonable, providing they are approved by a panel of medical specialists and either the patient or their representative.

The idea is that it would help overcome the problem of doctors only being covered legally to offer standard treatments – even in cases where it is clear that standard procedures will lead to poor life quality and the death of the patient.

Currently, if a doctor deviates from standard treatments, they could face the threat of legal action. 

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Dr Max Pemberton, a British  doctor, journalist and author, said: 'Worryingly, while doctors know that evidence-based medicine is not always the best choice for treating their patients, they have, in recent years, become increasingly scared of deviating from the standard treatments available to them, even if these don’t appear to be working.

'It’s a tragic indictment of modern medicine that too often innovation is jettisoned in favour of the status quo – not because it’s in the patient’s best interest, but because of the fear of being sued.' 

The legislation will have its detailed committee stage debate on Friday and the Department of Health said Lord Saatchi had tabled amendments adding extra safeguards to the Bill.

The peer told the Telegraph: 'In dealing with the deadly Ebola outbreak,  the World Health Organisation has  decided that departure from standard  evidence-based treatment is fully justified  and essential.

The Medical Innovation Bill is designed to allow dying patients to be treated with untested medicines in a bid to save their lives when tried-and-tested drugs have failed.

It also aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options.

The Bill was launched by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi two years ago after his wife Josephine Hart died from ovarian cancer.

Now Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has thrown his department's weight behind the Bill, which will be debated in parliament next week.

It has been supported by experts such as Sir Michael Rawlins, President of the Royal Society of Medicine, who said: 'The Saatchi Bill will allow responsible innovation'.

Professor Ahmed Ashour Ahmed, Professor of Gynaecological Oncology at the University of Oxford, believes the bill will deter irresponsible experimentation, while encouraging innovation in the care of cancer patients.

The General Medical Council and Cancer Research UK had concerns about the original version of the Bill, but after amendments were added, they are largely positive, The Telegraph reported.

But Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery at University College London, said : 'Changing the law with this bill is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, as a result of unintended consequences, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.'

'It has set ethical guidelines for the use  of new therapies and interventions - they  are identical to the provisions of the  Medical Innovation Bill.'

When the Bill had its second reading in June, Lord Saatchi told peers: 'All cancer deaths are wasted lives. 

'Scientific knowledge has not advance by one centimetre as a result of all these deaths, because the current law requires the deceased receive only the standard procedure - the endless repetition of a failed experiment.

'The current law is a barrier to progress in curing cancer.'

It is understood the Department of Health is minded to support the Bill, which would have to complete its passage through the Lords and then go through all its Commons stages before becoming law.

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'Innovation is at the heart of modernising the NHS and is essential for improving treatments and finding new cures and work on the Medical Innovation Bill is ongoing. 

'We are pleased that Lord Saatchi has tabled amendments to the Bill to help ensure patient and staff safety.' 

The General Medical Council (GMC) and Cancer Research UK both originally expressed concerns about the Bill but now broadly support the change in the law, providing safeguards are put in place.

Professor Sir Peter Rubin, Chair of the GMC, told MailOnline: ‘Medicine is a risky business. There are many people alive today because of the willingness of doctors to innovate, deal with uncertainty and take reasonable risks which are understood, shared with, and consented to, by the patient in accordance with good medical practice. 

‘While we welcome the amendments to the Bill in Lord Saatchi’s name we look forward to seeing the final version'.

Sarah Woolnough, the charity's Director of Policy and Information, said: 'We know that more could be done to promote innovation in cancer treatment, especially for patients with life-threatening conditions where there are few treatment options, and the Medical Innovation Bill aims to support clinicians to act innovatively where they have exhausted other options. 

'The latest set of amendments laid on the Medical Innovation Bill are an improvement, requiring a doctor to seek advice from an appropriately qualified colleague before departing from standard treatment. As the Bill now passes through Parliament, we must ensure it contains appropriate safeguards to protect patients.

'We will monitor the Bill’s progress closely and hope we will see a greater focus on innovation thanks to this Bill.'
