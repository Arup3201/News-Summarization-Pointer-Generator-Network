One in 10 Britons admit they can't go a day without a drink - more than double the international average, a new survey has revealed.

People in the UK are 41 per cent more 
likely to drink alcohol than in other countries, research by Bupa into 12 countries' drinking habits showed.

And despite the health warnings over excess alcohol, the survey showed a third of Britons who drink claim they don't want to cut back.

This was in contrast to international results, where almost three quarters of drinkers said they'd like to try and drink less. 

Experts blame the problem on too much of our social lives revolving around drinking, as well as a deep-seated resistance towards cutting back on alcohol. 

They also warned of the potential health consequences of excessive alcohol, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, liver disease and diabetes. 

The findings were part of Bupa's Health Pulse Survey, which saw the healthcare group question more than 13,000 people in 12 countries, including Australia, China, Spain, Mexico and the United States.

Bupa spokesperson Dr Layla McCay said: 'This is a worrying observation which implies that Brits are particularly resistant to change when it comes to drinking habits.

'Whether that is due to the lack of awareness about the effects that alcohol can have - or whether we are simply in denial - there is clearly more work to be done to raise awareness of the associated risks and the real impact it can have on lives.'

Highlighting the risks of too much alcohol, she added: 'Excessive drinking carries several health risks, including heart disease, stroke, liver disease, many types of cancer and even diabetes.

'Something needs to be done immediately and we need to challenge the social norms - social lives too often revolve around drinking and it is important we work towards coming up with healthier alternatives.

'It's not about total abstinence, but it is about drinking responsibly and being aware of the effects that heavy drinking can have.'

Chris Sorek, spokesperson for alcohol awareness group Drinkaware, said: 'There is always an excuse to drink but there are plenty of reasons to cut down too.

'It can be easy to drink more than you intended, by not being aware of the units in your favourite drink or pouring large measures at home.

'However, drinking can affect your sleep patterns, meaning you wake up feeling tired and stressed the next day.'

He added: 'Regularly drinking over the daily guidelines can lead to more serious health harms including alcohol-related liver disease, which has no warning signs. 

'Alcohol is also the second biggest risk factor for cancer after smoking - responsible for cancer of the breast, liver, bowel and mouth.'
