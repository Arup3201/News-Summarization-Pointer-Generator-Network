Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic denounced the United Nations war crimes tribunal as a 'satanic court' today as he refused to testify as a defence witness on behalf of his one-time ally Radovan Karadzic.

For many of the families of victims of Bosnian Serb atrocities it was the two men seen together for the first time in more than 17 years who had performed the work of Satan as thousands are said by war crimes prosecutors to have been murdered on their orders during the 1990s war in Bosnia.

The extraordinary courtroom reunion at The Hague lasted only about an hour as Mladic repeatedly told judges he would not answer the former Bosnian Serb leader's questions, citing ill health and an unwillingness to risk incriminating himself.

The two men - one the military enforcer, the other the politican who dreamed of creating an ethnically-cleansed pure Serb state in Bosnia - exchanged greetings as they saw one another again in public.

Both men had clearly aged but appeared unbowed displaying the same robust contempt for 'outsiders' they had in the years when their faces were known around the world.

Mladic, 71, said by his lawyers to be suffering from a condition that affects his memory, apologised to 68 year-old Karadzic as he refused to give evidence on his behalf, telling him as he left court: 'Thanks a lot, Radovan. I'm sorry, these idiots wouldn't let me speak. They defend Nato bombs.' 

Defence lawyer Peter Robinson said that 
Mladic was 'the one person in the whole world who knows best what 
happened in the war in Bosnia' and that Karadzic was asking him to do 
his best to testify and to tell what had occurred.

Karadzic, who was captured in the Serbian capital Belgrade after years on the run, faces 11 charges, including genocide relating to the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995.

Both men deny charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Dubbed the 'Butcher of Bosnia' after Srebrenica where more than 7,000 men and boys were executed, Mladic initially refused to take the oath, saying: 'Your subpoenas, your platitudes, your false indictments, I do not care one bit about any of it.'

He added: 'This is a satanic court, which is putting on trial us Serbs because we are defending our people from you.'

In one moment of light relief and farce, 
the hearing had to be delayed so that Mladic's dentures could be brought
 from his cell in the tribunal's detention centre

The two former allies barely made eye contact during the hearing.

Karadzic was businesslike - often looking down at documents on his desk.

Mladic appeared to be enjoying the attention, waving to the packed public gallery and saluting judges as he left court.

Going through the motions of the examination of a witness, Karadzic asked Mladic questions about the main allegations in their respective indictments, even though he knew the bullish general would refuse to answer.

He asked if Mladic had ever informed him 'prisoners' in Srebrenica would be or had been executed, an apparent reference to the 1995 massacre of thousands of Muslim men and boys in the eastern enclave.

He asked if the two leaders had agreed to subject residents of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, to a campaign of terror by shelling or sniping.

He asked why Serb forces conducted shelling and sniping in Sarajevo and, finally, he asked if the Bosnian Serb leadership had a plan to expel Croats and Muslims from Serb-held territory during the war.

Mladic repeatedly read out a refusal he had printed on a sheet of paper, once telling judges he touched upon the Srebrenica massacre in his seven-page prepared statement they had refused to allow him to read in court.

'I think it would be interesting,' he told judges.

As he stood up to leave, Mladic sardonically thanked judges for not letting him say what he wanted to say.

'You have confirmed my thesis that the Hague tribunal is not a court of law but a satanic court,' he said through a courtroom interpreter.
