A study found men shell out £106 for a bag on average – £42 more than women, who spend £64

It will come as a shock to any woman who's ever splashed out on the latest designer handbag, but men actually spend more on their 'manbags'.

A study found men shell out £106 for a bag on average – £42 more than women, who spend around £64.

Manbags are most popular among younger age groups.

Overall, one in ten men carries a bag most days, but this rises to a fifth among under-25s.  

Market researcher Mintel found men are more likely to choose bags made by luxury brands, while women tend to look for cheaper High Street styles.  

While each year three fifths of women buy themselves a new bag, a fifth of boyfriends or husband have bought a handbag as a present too. 

Last year the handbag market grew by nearly ten per cent to £1.3 billion and is expected to reach £1.9 billion by 2019.

Senior Fashion Analyst Tamara Sender said: 'Whilst manbags in the past have been met with mockery, men have now begun to see the item as acceptable to wear most of the time and as they become accustomed to the practicality of using a manbag they are likely to continue to use them as they age.

'Gifting is very important to the handbag market and given that men are inclined to spend more than women when buying handbags, this highlights the scope to help men with the handbag gift buying process.

'Retailers could offer a personalised gift shopping service allowing consumers to speak to a personal shopper via an online chat who can recommend potential handbags that would suit their partner or whoever they are buying for.'

In 2014 the handbag market grew by nearly 10%  to £1.3 billion and is expected to reach £1.9 billion by 2019 (file picture of man on a bike with manbag)
