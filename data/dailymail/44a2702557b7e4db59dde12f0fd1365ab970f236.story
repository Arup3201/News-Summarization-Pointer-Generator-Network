A man charged with murdering a University of Cincinnati adjunct instructor admits to burying the body and burning the victim's belongings - but claims he merely found the teacher dead, bound and gagged. 

Charles Black, 55, has been arrested and charged two months after Randall Russ went missing from the Ohio school. 

Last night, he told police officers he had been at Russ's home in mid-August minutes before and left to go to a neighbor's house.

When he got back, he said, Russ was dead, bound and gagged.   

With the help of 37-year-old co-suspect Kevin Howard, who is still at large, he then put Russ's body into the victim's own green Ford Forcus and drove it to the river bank, where they buried him in a shallow grave.

They then burned the mattress they had found him on, he told officers.

Black told investigators where to find Russ' body. Authorities have not positively identified the remains found in that location as Russ. 

On Tuesday, police found Russ's car which led them to Black.

A warrant has now been issued for the arrest of Kevin Howard, who is also wanted for murder, two counts of tampering with physical evidence and auto theft.

Russ was an adjunct instructor on the Upward Bound program for high school students at the University of Cincinnati.

The director of the program that Russ worked on, Phillip Cathey, released a statement about Russ on Friday.

He said: 'Randy was very personable with the Upward Bound students and his class was on of the favorites of the students in the program. 

'He always had a positive attitude and will be missed by the students, their parents and the Upward Bound staff.'
