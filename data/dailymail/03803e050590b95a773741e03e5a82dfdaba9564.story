Legal dispute: Chef Gordon Ramsay is suing the businessman he ran his Fat Cow restaurant with

Chef Gordon Ramsay is suing the businessman he ran his Fat Cow restaurant with to force him to share the legal costs of a lease dispute.

Fiery cook Ramsay is being sued by the landlord of the Los-Angeles-based eatery for a sum believed to be in the region of $6million dollars.

It’s claimed that Mr Ramsay was in breach of contract on a long-term lease at the Grove Shopping center by shutting the Fat Cow down earlier in 2014.

Now Ramsay is pursuing his ex-partner Rowen Seibel, saying that they’d agreed when they opened the restaurant in 2012 to share the costs of any lawsuits that might arise over the lease, according to TMZ.

It added that Ramsay also wants Mr Seibel to contribute to half the bill should they lose the case.

MailOnline has yet to receive a response from Mr Ramsay's representatives after a request for comment.

Earlier this year, Ramsay was accused of running the Fat Cow as a 'dictatorship', by Seibel.

He claimed in a New York civil suit that the cook made business decisions and ruled the burger joint with an iron fist, mimicking his demanding persona on the TV series Hell's Kitchen.

Seibel claims Ramsay 'secretly shut down' The Fat Cow before re-opening on his own under the name GR Roast, in a $10.8 million suit rubbished by Ramsay's people as 'ridiculous'.

And Siebel claims Ramsay assured him he would take care of a trademark problem surrounding Las Vacas Gordas, a Spanish restaurant in Florida who had registered The Fat Cow, alleging the chef told him: 'I am the trademark queen'.

'Ramsay attempted to run the business and make decisions on behalf of (his partners) similar to his television personality on Hell's Kitchen — as a dictatorship,' Seibel claims in court papers via his lawyer Paul Sweeney.

'Instead, in a dramatic money grab and breach of his fiduciary obligation to Seibel, Fat Cow LLC and FCLA, Gordon Ramsay began taking steps to secretly shut down Fat Cow Restaurant, using the trademark issue as his straw man excuse, and open a new restaurant at the premises without Seibel.'

Earlier this year, Ramsay was accused of running the Fat Cow as a 'dictatorship', by his ex-business partner

Ramsay was sued by The Fat Cow staff members in a class action last year 

Seibel invested $800,000 in The Fat Cow, but is not involved in Ramsay's new venture, where he will also film his reality TV series, Page Six reports.

'We're surprised that Mr Seibel has the audacity to file this ridiculous suit when he and his team were responsible for the day to day running of The Fat Cow and spectacularly mismanaged it resulting in a string of financial and legal issues,' a spokesman for Ramsay told MailOnline.

'Gordon Ramsay and his team immediately stepped in and tried to resolve these issues, but Seibel refused to engage in any meaningful conversations, rendering the restaurant unsustainable.

'Throughout, Ramsay was very forthcoming with Seibel that any future plan for another restaurant partnership in Los Angeles was impossible due to Seibel's refusal to operate and fund the restaurant properly.'

Ramsay was sued by The Fat Cow staff members in a class action last year, where it was alleged they were paid below minimum wage and not given proper breaks.
