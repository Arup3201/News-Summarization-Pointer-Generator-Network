Rural champion: Andrew Motion, former poet laureate, said that the environment is 'foremost in people's minds'

No countryside view will be free from pylons or warehouses if planning reforms go ahead, the former poet laureate warned yesterday.

Andrew Motion accused the Coalition of putting at risk Britain’s ‘great collaborative masterpiece’ – its countryside.

‘The environment is foremost in people’s minds, not just because disasters like the recent flooding and ash dieback disease increase our consciousness of what is at risk, but because we’re hearing government pronouncements that betray a wider pattern of neglect for the landscape,’ he wrote in an article published in The Lady.

‘By a thousand cuts, we will be left with a countryside so fragmented that it will be impossible to find a view unimpeded by pylons or warehouses.’

Sir Andrew, who is president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, pointed to a recent poll by his campaign group that showed more than 80 per  cent of the population wanted the natural environment protected at  all costs.

Yet, he added: ‘We are seeing the Coalition contradicting David Cameron’s ambition to lead the greenest government ever.’

Chancellor George Osborne also came under fire for saying protection of the green belt and the countryside was ‘red tape’. Research by the CPRE has identified plans for 80,000 homes on green belt land.

Planning minister Nick Boles caused fury in November by saying the Government needs to concrete over an area of greenfield land twice the size of Greater London.

But he was backed by Mr Cameron last month, who said large areas of the countryside will have to be built on to solve a ‘massive’ housing crisis.

The Prime Minister said it was not a target to develop 3 per cent more of Britain’s land – the figure outlined by Mr Boles – but he made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for homes to be built.

And he said the Government would continue to push for the planning system to be speeded up to allow development.

Sir Andrew said the planning system had historically prevented ‘needless urban sprawl while regenerating our cities’ and pointed to the Olympic Park as a good example of using brownfield sites.

He said: ‘Nick Boles seems determined to abandon this proven strategy, calling for developers to build on an area of open countryside two-and-a-half times the size of Greater London.

Warning: Mr Motion said that cuts would lead to the countryside becoming so 'fragmented' that it would be impossible to find 'a view unimpeded by pylons or warehouses'

‘The Prime Minister seems content to let Osborne and Boles demolish sound planning principles, despite that his political hero, Harold Macmillan, was one of planning’s greatest advocates.

‘Macmillan’s personal manifesto of 1938, The Middle Way, imagined an England where growth was promoted, up to a point.’

 Sir Andrew added: ‘Whatever happened to Cameron’s Big Society? The definition, at last, turns out to be, “Your voice counts, as long as you agree with the secretary of state”.

‘Even that great icon of England, the village green, is under threat from the growth-at-all-costs culture.’
