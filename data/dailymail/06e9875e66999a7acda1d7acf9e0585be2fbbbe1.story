Police have vowed to take action against those involved in the clip, which represents a growing trend of social media disseminated acts of violence, reports Courier Mail.

The video shows one man being knocked onto the floor multiple times as the onlookers cheer them on. 

Queensland Police Acting Commissioner Paul Taylor said the video represented a dangerous trend.

'We are trying to prevent assaults and anti-social behaviour, so it's frustrating when people use social media to facilitate activities that could potentially lead to serious injury or death,' he said. 

'What's more concerning is these fights are taking place in public areas where people should be able to frequent without having to be subjected to these violent acts.'

Police are believed to be compiling evidence in a bid to charge those involved.
