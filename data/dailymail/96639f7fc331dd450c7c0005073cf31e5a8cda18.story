A prestigious beachfront property on Australia's famous Gold Coast strip in Queensland sold for a loss of $4.7 million dollars on Sunday.

The Mediterranean style house on Hedges Ave at Mermaid Beach, set on a 405m sq block, was last bought in 2008 by cotton farmer Alan Frost for a whopping $8.7 million.

But despite over 50 inspections and four bidders on the day, the four bedroom house failed to secure much more than the opening bid of $3.8 million.

241 Hedges Ave at Mermaid Beach, a beachfront property on the Gold Coast was sold at a $4.7 million loss on Sunday

The prestigious four bedroom house was last bought for $8.7 million in 2008, but only sold for $4 million recently

The home features an open fireplace, an indoor spa, five bathrooms and a deck in the backyard that leads straight to the ocean.

Real estate agent Tony Velissariou from Prestige Property Sales in Surfers Paradise said the sale price was not much of a surprise, linking it's greatly decreased value to the GFC.

'Properties are only just slowly making a move back and increasing in that beach front sector after prestige property's of that sort declined back a certain degree from the GFC,' Mr Velissariou said.

'The market is increasing every month here at the moment and we will see pieces keep continuing to grow as our real estate sector has stabilised.'

Real estate agent Tony Velissariou from Prestige Property Sales in Surfers Paradise said the sale price was not much of a surprise, with the opening bid starting at only $3.8 million

He said the GFC was to primarily to blame for the decrease in value, and said the market is only just slowly catching up to the prices common in 2008-2009

Mr Velissariou also added, in relation to growing property values: 'We run approximately eight to 12 months behind the markets in Sydney and Melbourne'.

Despite the massive loss, the Mail Online was told that the former owner of the majestic house was happy with the price he got.

'The seller was quite happy. At the same time he's buying and selling in the same market, so he's really just swapping the deck chairs around in that sense,' Mr Velissariou said.

The new owner is believed to have bought the house as a holiday home.

Paul Pfeiffer, an Estate Agent for RT Edgar in Toorak Victoria, said that estates in Sydney and Melbourne are also struggling to return to the higher figures reached in 2008.

'I think it is common knowledge that the QLD market has been overpriced for a decade, fueled predominantly by offshore investment,' Mr Pfeiffer said.

Paul Pfeiffer, an Estate Agent for RT Edgar in Toorak Victoria, said that estates in Sydney and Melbourne are also struggling to return to the higher figures reached in 2008Â 

'Sydney and Melbourne are certainly holding their own, although sales in the top end of town are infrequent. The peak was in 2007 and 2008 and it wasn't until late last year that the market [in Melbourne and Sydney] caught up to the prices achieved during this period.'

He said that the weakest market - which struggles to sell quickly - is the luxury, particularly properties worth more than $10 million mark.

'In Toorak you could not confidently put a property to auction and expect it to be sold on auction day. There are a number of $11 to $25 million dollar properties sitting and waiting for the right buyer to appear.'
