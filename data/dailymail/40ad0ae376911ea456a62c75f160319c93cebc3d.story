Model, drummer, singer, actress, fashion designer and professional party girl - is there anything Cara Delevingne hasn't squeezed into her 21 years?

The supermodel has added another string to her bow by turning seamstress in a new fashion video.

Ahead of the launch of the Cara Delevingne Collection this September, luxury label Mulberry has released a film taking a look at Cara’s creative journey from the collection’s concept at Mulberry’s head office in London to craft at The Rookery, Mulberry’s flagship factory in Somerset.

Many talents: A new video released by Mulberry shows Cara Delevingne designing her new handbag collection for the luxury brand - and she's a whizz on the sewing machine

The film documents Cara's project with Mulberry from the initial concept through to design amends and production.

To garner inspiration for the collection, Cara visited the archives, choosing leathers, sketching ideas and discussing the practical needs she had for a multi-functional bag.

The supermodel even uses her famous tattoos as inspiration with the lion inking inspiring the studs on the bags and her 'made in England' tattoo being printed onto the bottom of her arm candy.

Testing, testing! Cara, 21, gives one of the satchels a good sniff at the Mulberry flagship factory in Somerset

Earlier 
this week she said that young girls should aim for careers that are 
more intellectually demanding than modelling but today, Cara Delevingne 
stayed true to the career choice that rocketed her to fame by posing
 in the new Mulberry campaign.

The
 21-year-old, who made her TV acting debut in last night's Playhouse Presents 
on Sky Arts tonight, proves in this new imagery why she became a 
household name.

Posing
 in an array of fur coats and crisp white blouses, Cara shows off the 
range she designed for the quintessentially British brand.

 debut on Sky Arts tomorrow after revealing that acting is her true 
passion

Although Mulberry's new
bag is available in a limited edition lion design inspired by the 
model's tattoo, there were also were plenty of other options on 
offer.

The hero piece is undoubtedly the beautiful 
quilted nappa leather style, available in a range of colours, including black and green.

Living up to her quirky reputation, the model said of her creations: 'My Granny will like this bag,'
she revealed of the calfskin camo design. 'She’s 102 years old.' Bizarrely, she went on: 'My 
five-year-old cousin will probably like this bag. He’s a boy.'

she says her male cousin would love

In little more than 
two years, Cara has reached
supermodel status, 
but in a 
recent interview she seemed a tad downbeat about her chosen industry.

While she acknowledges her ‘luck’ at having achieved so much in such a short space of time, she told Alexis Petridis of The Guardian that young girls should be aspiring for careers that are more intellectually demanding.

When asked what she’d do if her daughter 
wanted to become a model, she replied: ‘I’d say no, if that’s all she 
aspired to. You know, I get a lot of girls who say, I just want to be a 
model so badly. And I think: You can do better than that.

Career change: The British supermodel is bagging
 quite a few film roles. She stars opposite Kate Beckinsale and Daniel 
Bruhl in the thriller The Face of an Angel, to be released later this 
year, as well as playing a small part in Pan directed by Joe Wright

‘I mean, look, I do love it, I’m not saying anything bad about it, I just think you can do a lot more.’

She
adds: ‘I was incredibly lucky to do as well as I’ve done, it’s not 
easy, there’s so many models go through so much s**t, and it’s just, if 
you have a brain, which everyone does, use it and try and do something 
else.’

Today, she told The Metro: 'Acting is all I ever wanted to do so I'm living the dream. I prefer acting to modelling.'

Cara’s ascent began in the offices of 
fashion website Asos in 2012, where she was ‘discovered’ by Burberry’s 
Christopher Bailey while working as an intern. 

‘As
a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense,’ 
she said.  ‘When I started, the whole idea of the model was very 
different, it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to
have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.’

That
smile, allied with a series of comedic expressions, has become 
something of a trademark - and a magnet for the cameras that follow her 
every move.

What's 
more, the star admits she would love to quit modelling herself one day 
and go away and make a music album for six months.

She said: 'That's what I'd f**king love to do. And when this shit doesn't work out, yeah, I will block that out and do it.'

Big break: Cara will make her acting debut tonight on Sky Atlantic's Playhouse Presents alongside Sylvia Simms

Success: Cara Delevingne's fortunes have changed
drastically over the last two years. From comparatively humble 
beginnings as a fashion intern at Asos, she is now one of the world's 
most successful, and sought after young models 

To
 celebrate the collaboration, Mulberry is offering a 
winner a signed Cara Delevingne Bag from the collection. To enter, fans
