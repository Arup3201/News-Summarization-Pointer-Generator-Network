The mother of a 17-month-old girl who died after her neck became caught in the cord of a window blind has spoken of her heartbreak.

Amanda O'Halloran has described the moment she attempted to resuscitate her daughter Sophia after discovering her lifeless body.

She said her daughter hanged herself while playing at the family home in Tirley, near Gloucester, after she had been left alone for less than four minutes.

Miss O'Halloran said: 'Sophia was watching Peppa Pig on TV, which was her favourite. I went upstairs to go to the toilet and then went to grab some clothes for her to wear.

'When I came downstairs I couldn't see her at first and I immediately grew worried. Then I saw her there hanging on the blind cord. I was hysterical.

'I ran to her, grabbed her and started doing CPR. I was totally frantic.

'I had trained to do first aid but never thought I'd be doing it on my own daughter.

'I called the emergency number and the paramedics came by air ambulance. They took her to hospital.

'But there was nothing they could do. It was horrible. Only moments before she had been a happy, healthy child - so cheeky and full of life. And then she was dead, just like that.'

Family: Miss O'Halloran and her partner Chris Parslow are still struggling to come to terms with Sophia's untimely death

Miss O'Halloran and her partner Chris Parslow have spoken about their ordeal as they start a campaign, called Sophia's Cause, to get looped blind cords banned across the UK.

The campaign includes a Facebook page and an online petition which would force the issue to be debated in parliament if it is signed by 100,000 people.

Sophia died on the morning of June 27.

The blind cord had been in the house since the couple moved in 18 months earlier. Hidden behind the curtain, it had gone unnoticed.

Miss O'Halloran said: 'Sophia was so inquisitive, looking to grab hold of things all the time.

'I have gone over it in my head over and over again - all the whats and ifs. What if we'd got rid of the cord? What if I had come downstairs sooner?'

Campaign: Miss O'Halloran and Mr Parslow have launched a campaign called Sophia's Cause to have cord blinds banned in the UK

Miss O'Halloran and Mr Parslow are still struggling to come to terms with Sophia's untimely death.

But they are determined no parents should go through the pain they are experiencing.

Through Sophia's Cause the couple are campaigning to have cord blinds banned in the UK.

Miss O'Halloran said: 'It's still very hard for us but I know that nothing will bring her back.

'If one good thing could come out of this, it would be that other parents realise the dangers of cord blinds and get rid of them from their homes. It would make us happy if other children are saved because of Sophia.'

An inquest into Sophia's death will take place in Gloucester on November 14.
