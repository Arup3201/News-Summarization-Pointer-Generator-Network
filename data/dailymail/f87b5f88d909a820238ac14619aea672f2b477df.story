A quick-thinking state trooper has saved a suicidal man after spotting him just as he was about to jump off a bridge.

Video taken by the camera on Maryland State Trooper Joshua Kim's cruiser recorded the dramatic moment he ran towards the man and pulled him away as he tried to climb over the edge.

The heroic rescue came after Kim saw the man walking along the road while he drove across the Millard E. Tydings Memorial 
Bridge over the Susquehanna River on Saturday.

Kim also saw a parked car so he turned around to check on the man.

In danger: A Maryland State Trooper spotted this man standing near the edge of the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge and approached him. The man can be seen trying to wave him on

Quick thinking: But as the trooper climbs out of his cruiser, the man goes to jump off the side of the bridge

As the cruiser slows down, the video shows the man apparently dismissing him with his hand before starting to climb over the wall.

But Kim is quick on his feet and runs towards the man, grabbing him around the chest and pulling him backwards away from the edge.

'Most of what you see in that video is me
 thinking on my own, because I didn't want to go over the bridge with 
him, so I got down on my knees and pulled him back,' Kim told WBAL.

Both men fall on the ground and Kim is able to put handcuffs on him for his own safety, the video shows.

The man, who told Kim he had been thinking about jumping off the bridge for about an hour after struggling with medical issues and problems with his daughter, was not charged.

Tackle: He grabs him and pulls him back from the edge just moments before the man would have jumped

Saved: He pulls the man to the ground. He later revealed he was suffering medical problems and was having problems with his daughter and had been thinking about jumping off the bridge for an hour

The trooper took him to Hartford Memorial Hospital, where he is being evaluated.

Kim has been a trooper for two years and this is the first time he has saved a person's life, Maryland State police spokeswoman Elena Russo told the Havre De Grace Patch.

'It could have been tragic for both of 
them,' Russo said. 'It took a lot of courage putting his own life in danger.'

The video was shared on YouTube and the Maryland State Police's Facebook page, where viewers praised the trooper for his work.

'Our heroes at work!!' one wrote. 'Fantastic response and reaction. Trooper, thank God you were in the right place at the right time. I pray for this gentleman - I pray that he receives the help that he needs.'
