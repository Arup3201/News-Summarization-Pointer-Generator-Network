A man who was jailed for 10 years for having sex with a female goat came face-to-face with his victim in a Kenyan court. 

The goat watched quietly from the corner of the court room in Malindi while Katana Kitsao Gona, 28, was jailed for bestiality. 

According to Jimmy Kimaru, chief prosecutor, Gona was caught sexually assaulting the goat in a bush in Dabaso, Kilifi county, on November 25.

The goat had been tied to graze by its owner, Sarah Kadenge, for the afternoon. 

But when a passer-by went to relieve himself in the bush he was shocked to discover Gona having sex with the animal.

The man reported what he had seen to the goat's owner who cornered Gona and took him to Watamu Police Station. 

Following a medical examination carried out by Munga Gambo, a veterinary officer from Malindi, it was confirmed that the goat had been sexually abused.
