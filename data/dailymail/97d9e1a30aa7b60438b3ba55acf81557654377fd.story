A journalist wearing Google Glass had the device stolen and smashed right in front of his eyes in San Francisco this evening.

Business Insider reporter Kyle Russell was covering a protest in the Mission district Friday night, where hundreds had gathered to voice outrage over Google lawyer Jack Halprin evicting tenants from his building.

After the protest, Russell and coworker went to a cafe where they worked for an hour before packing up and heading to the 16th street BART station to go home.

Against Google: Russell picked perhaps a bad day to wear his Google glasses. He was covering a protest against a Google executive who is evicting long-time tenants from his building

Without thinking, Russell kept his Google glasses on instead of storing them in his backpack and it was en route to the station that he had the $1,500 device stolen.

In a story on Business Insider, Russell describes the moment he was mugged. He first heard a woman yell 'Glass!' and then the device being ripped off his face.

'I ran after, through traffic, to the corner of the opposite block. The person pivoted, shifting their weight to put all of their momentum into an overhand swing. The Google Glass smashed into the ground, and they ran in another direction,' Russell said.

Not sure how to respond, Russell grabbed the remnants of his glasses and chased after the woman but eventually lost her.

A cop car pulled up soon after and he gave a description of the woman to them but they were not able to locate the thief.

While trying to file a police report, Russell tweeted about the attack and says he first received replies of overwhelming concern.

Then the onslaught of negative reactions came.

'At first, I failed to see the humor in what had happened to me,' Russell wrote. 'I had just been mugged, right?'

But Russell eventually realized that his experience having his property stolen was similar to the protests he covered that very day, where long-time San Francisco residents were being kicked out of their homes by a Google exec.

For them, the Google Glasses were a symbol of gentrification in the city.

'I was pretty shaken after seeing someone completely disregard my personal space and property without provocation. I imagine that feeling is only a shadow of what dislocated people in this city experience every day.

'And I can see why the person who smashed my Glass did what they did,' Russell said.Â
