A suspected Queensland bikie, who has the letters FTP - an acronym for 'f*** the police' - tattooed on his forehead, has issued a call-to-arms on social media to combat 'police corruption'.

Lorne Campbell, from Queensland's Sunshine Coast, escaped being charged under Queensland's tough new bikie laws despite holding the keys to a Rebels clubhouse and drinking with gang members, according to The Courier Mail.

The Rebels are an outlawed bikie gang in the state. But now Campbell - who also owns a clothing label called FTP clothing - is in the headlines for another reason.

The 33-year-old has taken to social media website - including Facebook and YouTube - to rant about alleged corruption in the Queensland Police Service and taken aim at Premier Campbell Newman's crackdown on bikies.

His Facebook page has attracted almost 4,700 friends and his videos have racked up more than 8,500 views.

In one video, entitled 'FTP...I'M NO ANGEL',  an impassioned Campbell said he was standing up for everyone who had been 'falsely charged and stitched up'.

'Listen I'm no angel and I have never said I was,' he said.

So far, the suspected bikie has attracted almost 4,700 friends on Facebook and more than 8,500 views on his YouTube channel

'But I am not the one who took a vow to uphold the law.

'And despite my personal opinion, I'm a realist and I know we will always have a police force in Australia.

'But this does not mean we have to settle for this corrupt one.'

Campbell also admits he has broken law but he would stand be an accused of crimes he did not commit.

'I have been punished for them, I'm not complaint about that,' he said.

'But getting stitched up and charged with zero evidence for a crime I did not do is not something I will sit back and take.

'I know my case may be a small one compared to a lot of other people's but I'm standing up and fighting, not only for me but for everyone who has been falsely charged and stitched up.'

Along with his FTP tattoo - which he has tattooed on him 'several times' - Campbell also has the words 'No comment' tattooed above his upper lip, which he reveals in this video to be a creed he lives by.

'To the little weak grubs who want to throw gigs about my 'No comment' tattoo...I have never made a statement, I have never taken part in an interview and I have never given anyone up,' he told the camera in the more than one-minute video.

'No one has ever been charged or done a day's jail over me.'

In another video on his channel, Campbell urges people to act immediately against police corruption.

'The time is now people. We need to seriously do something about this corruption...we need to stand up for our rights,' he said.

'If not for ourselves then for our children or our children's children.'

Lorne Campbell has his own clothing label called FTP clothing, which is 'dedicated to producing the most comfortable clothing, featuring the boldest, most eye-catching, all original designs for men and women'
