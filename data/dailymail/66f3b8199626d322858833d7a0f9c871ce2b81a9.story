A two-year-old boy who is dying of cancer will serve as best man at his parents' wedding this Saturday after doctors gave him two to three weeks to live.

Sean Stevenson and Christine Swidorsky, of Jeannette, Pennsylvania had planned to wed in July next year but chose to move the ceremony to this weekend so their son, Logan, who has leukemia and other complications, could participate.

On Friday, doctors gave the little boy 
two to three weeks to live. He has Fanconi anemia, a rare disease that 
often results in cancer. He has already lost one kidney and has a mass on his remaining kidney.

'We want Logan in our family pictures, and we want him to see his mother and dad get married,' Swidorsky told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

Swidorsky plans to carry Logan, who has a tiny suit picked out, down the aisle at the impromptu backyard ceremony that will double as a celebration of Logan's life.

Swidorsky's daughter Isabella Johns, 13, will be a bridesmaid and the couple's one-year-old daughter, Savannah, will be the flower girl. Around 100 guests are expected to attend.

The sick toddler spends most days at home wrapped in a blanket clutching his stuffed bunny.

'It hurts so bad because Logan is such a loving child ... when I cry he wipes my tears away,' Swidorsky told The Tribune-Review. 'Logan is a mama's boy.'

Logan was born on October 22, 2010 and at 14 months, he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. A year ago, he had a stem cell transplant and several months later he was diagnosed with a kidney tumor. In March, a kidney was removed.

'His entire life has been nothing but hospitals,' Kellie Young, the toddler's aunt told the newspaper. #

Tears: Sean Stevenson, right, feels helpless dealing with Logan's prognosis

Swidorsky said the family recently went on a Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World but the adventure was cut short when Logan came down with septic shock and hydration shock and was rushed back to his hometown.

He has been in Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh until earlier this month.

On Friday, doctors told the devastated parents that continuing treatment would not be beneficial.

They told Swidorsky and Stevenson the best thing for Logan was to be at home with his parents, that he would be in less pain there.

'For such a small person, he has touched thousands of people,' Young said.

Logan's father said he felt happy he has had the chance to bring his son home from hospital and spend this time with him. But at the same time he said he felt helpless, knowing what lies ahead.

'It'll be the hardest thing I'll ever do is bury my son. You know it's coming, and you can't do anything about it,' he said.
