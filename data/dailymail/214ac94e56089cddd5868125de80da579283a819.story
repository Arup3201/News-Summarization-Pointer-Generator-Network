Following last year’s hugely popular Look For Longer game, in which players guessed the name of London Underground stations from cryptic picture clues, the designers have created a sequel.

Look For Longer 2 features 100 underground stations – 25 more than last year’s game – and all the clues have been submitted by members of the general public.

Example clues include a road sign showing the number 007, for tube station Bond Street, and a dagger in a ham on the left of the poster for Dagenham East.

To guess clues, players hover over the
image and click 'Have a guess'. A pop-up box will appear where the 
player can type their answer.

If it's correct, a tick will appear in
the bottom box. If it's close, the middle box on the right-hand side 
changes to yellow, and if it's wrong a cross appears in the top box 
and it turns red.

There is a progress bar at the bottom of the interactive poster.

The game is launching in 45 London Underground stations from today and is also available to play online.

In September, website work.shop.play asked members of the public to submit ideas for Look for Longer 2’s clues.

The best 100 visual clues have been placed on top of a fictional street and each clue is credited to the person who suggested it.

If players get stuck they can ask for help on Twitter using the hashtag #lookforlonger and anyone who correctly guesses all the clues will be entered into the #100club.

Last year’s game was played by nearly 300,000 players across 170 countries. Simon Harrington, Marketing Director at CBS Outdoor UK who helped create the game said: ‘The first Look for Longer game set the bar high, and was always going to be hard to top. Naturally we want its successor to be even bigger and better.’

After the game closes, prints of the poster will be sold online.

The game runs until 15 December.
