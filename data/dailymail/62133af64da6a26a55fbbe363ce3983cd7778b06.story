Missing: Amy Latham, 18, had recently finished her A-levels and was planning a gap year to visit her sister Rachel in Australia

A body believed to be that of a missing teenager was found in woods near her family home last night.

Amy Latham was last seen on Monday afternoon and a full-scale search was launched. The 18-year-old had previously tweeted that she ‘felt like crying’ over her exam revision.

The tragic discovery near her family's £300,000 home in Wimborne, Dorset, came hours after her father Graham Latham made a heartfelt plea for her to return.

Mr Latham released a message yesterday saying: ‘I just want you to get in touch with us, we won’t be angry, we just want you back.’

The 55-year-old described his daughter as ‘very kind, outgoing and much loved by her friends’.

A post on a Facebook appeal page last night said: 'The Latham family are devastated to say that Amy's body has been found. They want to thank Amy's friends and family for their support.'

Amy – who was 18 last week – had recently finished her A-levels and was planning a gap year to visit her sister Rachel in Australia.

But in the weeks leading up to her disappearance, the pupil at Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne had expressed anxiety about her exams on social media sites.

On June 5 she posted to her followers on Twitter: ‘Option 1: stay in, cry over Macbeth notes, fail English A-level Option 2: go out, cry over ignored responsibilities, fail English A-level.’

On May 15 she said: ‘Someone kill me before I f*** up my English exam for the second time in a row.’

A-level exams were taken during June and 
results are due to be released on August 14. But friends today took to 
social media to suggest Amy had other 'complex' issues in her life.

Ethan Jones wrote on Facebook: ‘I, along with many others of Amy's friends, are utterly disgusted with the way that Amy has been portrayed especially as she had a lot of other complex things going on in her life and something as trivial as her A-levels were probably the least of her worries.’

The girl was last seen by a neighbour in a 
field behind her house at 1.30pm on Monday. She then texted a friend at 
around 2.30pm, but after that no one heard from her.

Amy, who turned 18 last week, did not 
take any clothes or money with her when she disappeared from her home on
 Monday morning.

She did take her mobile phone with her and last made contact with a friend at 2.30pm. 

Mr Latham said: ‘I saw her on Monday morning before I went to work about 7.30am and said goodbye and blew her a kiss.

'After that she had the house to herself and the neighbour last saw her in a field behind our house around 1.30pm.’

Find: The discovery of the body came near her family's £300,000 home on this road in Wimborne, Dorset

Police
 have referred the case to the Dorset coroner. A post-mortem examination is 
due to take place tomorrow.

Martin McLeman, headteacher of the Queen Elizabeth's School, described Amy as a ‘delightful, hardworking student’.

He said: ‘We are devastated by this news. All our thoughts are with her family and friends at this extremely sad time.

‘Amy was a delightful, hardworking student who was very popular with both staff and students. She will be greatly missed.

‘Although
 Year 13 have finished their exams and have officially left school, 
counselling and support will be available to them and everyone in the 
school community affected by this tragic event.’

Amy's mother Sue, 51, is separated from the girl's father and lives in nearby Sturminster Marshall. Friends today left bunches of flowers outside Amy's house in Wimborne as a mark of respect.

The message on one bunch propped up against the front door of the house reads: ‘Graham, Sue and Rachel. There are no words in the English language that could even begin to describe the loss of our beautiful Amy.

‘My thoughts are with you always. Amy will never leave our hearts. All my love, Hannah.’

Another said ‘Graham, Sue and Rachel. I honestly have no words for this tragedy, it has left my heart aching. Just know that I am thinking of you all. Our beloved Amy will be the brightest shining star up there. All my love, Rosie Finn.’

A third card said: ‘Graham, Sue and Rachel. I honestly don't know what to say, just want you to know our thoughts and prayers are with you all. With love and hugs? Jo and Paul.’

Shocked neighbours who knew Amy also paid tribute to her. Maria Hayter, 47, an assistant manager, said: ‘I have lived here for about 11 years and they have been there since just after us.

‘I have seen Amy since she was little as my son went to school with her. A couple of times, if she had lost her key, she would come in here so she was safe when her dad was at work.

‘I don't know anything about what happened on Monday. All I know is that Graham came back from work and found out she wasn't there.

‘He popped over to me and all the neighbours and asked if anybody had seen her. It's really shocking, especially having kids of a similar age. It makes you go cold.

‘She would have just finished her exams, she had her whole life ahead of her. I feel for the family and know her dad must be terribly distraught.’

'Someone kill me before I f*** up my English exam for the second time in a row'

And people took to social media to 
leave tributes to the teenager. One said: ‘Rest in Peace Amy Latham, you
 will always be an angel.’

Another added: ‘It’s one of those things that you just can’t believe...RIP Amy, thoughts are with her friends and family.’

Hannah Boon wrote: ‘Thank you for so many incredible memories. Rest in peace you perfect human being, we'll never forget you.’

And Jenny Ireland said: ‘You were, and still are, amazing. Thanks for your friendship to me and so many others that will feel the empty space that you have left. RIP Amy Latham.’

Heather Revitt added: ‘We are so desperately sad that this has happened to such a wonderful family. Our hearts go out to you Sue, Graham and Rachel. We will all miss Amy's beautiful smile. RIP.’

Another student said she shared a room with her on holiday and she ‘was so kind, friendly and caring’.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said: ‘Sadly a body has been found which is believed to be the missing teenager from Wimborne. Her next of kin and a coroner have been informed.’

Police are not treating the death as suspicious. Before the discovery, officers said that they were ‘gravely concerned’ for Amy’s welfare.
