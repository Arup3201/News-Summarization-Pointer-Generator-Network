For fans of sci-fi films, it may look strangely familiar.

British car firm Lotus has unveiled its first ever motorcycle - and looks a lot like the famous Light cycle from the film Tron.

In fact, Lotus worked with the designer of the Tron bike on the project.

The C-01 is the first Lotus motorcycle - although the car firm will let someone else produce it

The C-01 will be available in a range of special Lotus colour schemes, and customers lucky enough to buy them can even design their own

Lotus has not yet revealed the top speed or the price of the bike.

However, it has released some specs:

2-cylinder 4-stroke engine1,195cc200 HP6-gear jaw-type shift transmission

Ride height:        90 mmHeight of seat:        710 mmFuel tank capacity:        10.5lDry weight:        181 kg

'Following two years of careful planning and intense development, Kodewa is delighted to announce that the prototype of the world’s first motorcycle to bear the legendary Lotus marque is now road registered and ready for action,' the firm said.

However, Lotus will not be making the bike itself, instead granting German firm Kodewa a license to produce it.

'The C-01 combines ample power via a V-twin engine with a distinctive body designed by Daniel Simon integrating carbon fibre, titanium and aerospace quality steel,' the firm said.

Just 100 of the bikes will be made in a range of special designs reflecting the most iconic Lotus colour schemes, and customers can even design their own.

The C-01 was designed by Daniel Simon, who also designed the Tron Lightcycle

Production of the bike has already begun - even though Lotus has not yet revealed how much it will cost

Designer Daniel Simon also worked with Disney to design the Tron Light cycle in the hit film.

A former designer for Bugatti Automobiles, he also designed the ‘Bubbleship’ used by Tom Cruise in the recent Universal sci-fi hit ‘Oblivion’.

The German is also responsible for the black and gold livery of the Lotus LMP2 sports cars.

'The design process of the C-01 was a labour of love, there were many challenges, ensuring that the bike not only touches your visual senses with its timeless blend of classic appeal and modern execution, but that is safe and ergonomically sound was critical to me,' he said.

'We have worked hard to create a motorcycle with very distinctive features such as a clean main body, an extremely low side profile, a bold stance, a unique air intake, logical partline solutions and clean graphics.'

The original idea to create the C-01 came from Kodewa’s Dr Colin Kolles.

Speaking about the project he said: 'We set out to create a bike that isn’t just great to ride but also represents a piece of art in motion.

The bike was designed to be 'truly jaw dropping'

'Over the years I have seen my fair share of style over substance, what this bike brings to the market is a unique combination of both: state of the art technology with a truly jaw-dropping aesthetic.'

Günther Holzer, CEO of Holzer Group said: 'I was one of the first people to ride it and I have to say I was very impressed.

'Together we have found that delicate balance between raw, aggressive power and breath-taking handling.

'The team has created something very special, it looks incredible, it sounds fantastic but above all, the ride is sensational. I’m very happy.'
