Newly released documents show the body of at 
least one baby found in the garage of a Utah woman accused of killing 
six of her newborns over a decade was covered in a chemical that smelled
 like iodine.

In addition, suspect Megan Huntsman told police in a phone conversation on the day the first body was found by her husband that the baby was stillborn and she had been  afraid to go to police or a hospital, the search warrant affidavit says,

She didn't say why she was scared.

On trial: Megan Huntsman, a Utah woman accused of killing six babies she gave birth to over 10 years, appears in court in Provo, Utah, on April 21, 2014. The 39-year-old told investigators that she either strangled or suffocated the six children and then put them inside boxes in her garage

Prosecutors have filed six first-degree murder charges against Huntsman, who allegedly doused at least one of the babies in a chemical before hiding it in the garage of her estranged husband's parents house

A state judge granted county prosecutors a week to sort through evidence and ensure they choose the proper charges. Huntsman is being held on $6 million bail

Authorities also reported finding bloody leather gloves and women's underwear in the garage, and infant booties and clothes in the master bedroom.

Police took stained sections of a mattress in the master bedroom as evidence.

Police have said Darren West, the estranged husband of Huntsman, 39, found the first body after opening a small white box covered with electrician's tape on April 12.

The documents released Friday state that West also told police he discovered the baby in a plastic bag with a strong chemical odor emanating from it.

West said there was no decomposition smell, just a chemical odor.

Police in Pleasant Grove discovered the six other dead babies after obtaining a search warrant for the house.

They were in boxes throughout the garage, wrapped in shirts or towels, documents show.

Huntsman later acknowledged that from 1996 to 2006, she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and packed them inside boxes in the garage south of Salt Lake City, separate court document states.

Huntsman said one infant found in the garage was stillborn.

Huntsman has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder.

She has not entered a plea.

Investigators say they know Huntsman's motive but declined to discuss it publicly.

During a brief court appearance Monday in Provo, the shackled Huntsman mostly kept her eyes focused downward as she was informed of the charges.

Defense attorney Doug Thompson told reporters afterward that he has spoken with Huntsman and she seemed fine, though he declined to provide details on her state of mind.

Investigators believe West is the father of the babies.

He lived with Huntsman during the decade the babies were killed and was in federal prison on drug charges from 2006 until January.

Prosecutors said he is cooperating with the investigation and is not a suspect.

Authorities are awaiting DNA testing to confirm Huntsman and West are the parents of the babies, and to determine the sex of the children.

Their causes of death also remain uncertain.

The FBI has been brought in to help because no labs in Utah can analyze the type of DNA taken from the small corpses, police said.
