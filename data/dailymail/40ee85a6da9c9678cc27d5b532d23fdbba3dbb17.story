Susie Wolff has expressed her disappointment at completing only four laps on her full Formula One debut.

The 31-year-old Briton became the first female driver to step into an F1 cockpit during a grand prix weekend in more than two decades when she took part in the opening practice session at Silverstone on Friday morning.

But Wolff lasted just 20 minutes of 
the one hour-and-a-half session before grinding to a halt on track with 
an oil-pressure problem.

She
 completed just four laps and ended the session almost nine seconds down
 on championship leader Nico Rosberg in his Mercedes.

‘It
 is a massive disappointment,’ said Wolff. ‘On the one side, we had such
 a good build-up to this weekend; obviously I had put in so much hard 
work, so much preparation to get ready for today and I knew exactly what
 I had to do on every lap out there.

‘It
 felt good - even the out lap - but that is racing, and I have known 
from over the years, that there can be massive ups and massive downs.’

Wolff
 will be handed another chance at the wheel of the WIlliams during 
practice for the German Grand Prix later this month, but the Briton 
insists there won’t be added pressure on her to impress despite her 
horror show at Silverstone.

‘It
 is very, very disappointing, but I have still got Hockenheim, and I 
have to go out and show what I can do because I did not get the chance 
to do that today,’ she added.

‘There isn’t extra pressure. It is about having the same approach, being well prepared and knowing exactly what I have to do.

‘You
 can’t expect to be on the grid unless you show that you are good enough
 to be there. Until I have done a good job in Hockenheim then I am not 
willing to say too much about the future.’

Toto
 Wolff, husband to Susie, and shareholder at Williams, was seen dining 
in the British team’s new motorhome during lunch on Friday.

‘He
 has been very suppoportive and I am incredibly lucky in that sense,’ 
Wolff said of her husband, and executive director at Mercedes.

‘He
 is my biggest supporter, but also my biggest critic. He knew that I had
 to go out there and do a good job today and there was no chance of 
messing it up. He is quite sad that I didn’t get to show it.’
