Luis Suarez is facing a lengthy ban after the Liverpool striker bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder in  Uruguay’s 1-0 World Cup victory on Monday.

For the third time in his troubled career, the 27-year-old has been caught on camera sinking his teeth into an opponent.

Incredibly, the controversial striker attempted to explain the outrageous incident by saying: ‘These things happen in the box. We were in contact, chest against shoulder and I got a knock in the eye.’

Ouch: Chiellini attempts to show the bite marks to referee Marco Rodriguez

Victim Chiellini declared: ‘Suarez is a 
sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in 
the World Cup. I’d love to see ifthey have the courage to use video evidence against him.

‘The referee saw the bite mark, too, but he did nothing about it.’

FIFA have indicated they will investigate today after Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez did not see the incident.

The world governing body will no doubt look unkindly on Suarez, given his long history of disciplinary issues.

They
 have the power to ban any player for as long as two years if they see 
fit. It is more likely that Suarez will receive a much shorter 
retrospective ban that could still end his tournament after Monday’s 
victory saw Uruguay advance to the last 16 at Italy’s expense.

Italian pulled down his shirt to display the evidence after the 
incident.

Suarez, though, walked through the interview area smiling after the game and refused to answer questions.

Earlier in a bad-tempered match, Italian midfielder Claudio Marchisio had been sent off for a stamp at Cristian Rodriguez.  

Chiellini
 added: ‘The disparity in judgment has been evident. Marchisio’s 
sending-off was ridiculous but more so the fact that Suarez wasn’t sent 
off.

‘There’s the will to protect champions but the referee should have shown him a red card.’

Italian
 coach Cesare Prandelli resigned after Italy’s exit, while his opposite 
number Oscar Tabarez refused to accept that Suarez had done anything 
wrong.

Undeserved? Diego Godin scored seconds later to send Uruguay through to the Second Round

Uruguay defender Diego Lugano said: ‘I didn’t see anything. Did you see it here or did you see what happened in other years?

‘You
 couldn’t have seen it here because nothing happened. The worst of 
everything is the attitude of Chiellini. He’s a great player with an 
enormous status but this doesn’t correspond with Italian football. As 
sportsmen leaving the field, crying and appealing against a rival, it’s 
not good. As a man he disappointed me totally.’

The longest ban in 
World Cup history was eight games for Italy’s Mauro Tassotti after he 
broke the nose of Spain’s Luis Enrique in 1994.

FIFA vice-president 
Jim Boyce said last night: ‘I have watched the incident several times on
 television. There is no doubt Luis Suarez is a fantastic footballer 
but, once again, his actions have left him open to severe criticism. 
FIFA must investigate the incident.’
