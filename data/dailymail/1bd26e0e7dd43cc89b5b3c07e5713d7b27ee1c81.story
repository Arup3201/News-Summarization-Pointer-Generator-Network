Rangers shareholder Mike Ashley has made a move to oust directors Graham Wallace and Philip Nash from the Ibrox board.

Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, upped his stake in the Scottish Championship club six days ago, increasing his stake in the Glasgow giants to 8.9 per cent.

Now the Sports Direct owner - widely rumoured to be plotting a push for more control - has called for an emergency general meeting.

The current Rangers board have said they will fight to save Wallace and Nash's positions in a statement to the London Stock Exchange statement, saying: 'The company announces that it has received a notice from Mike Ashley.

'The notice states that MASH holds 4,265,000 Ordinary Shares of 1p each in the Company amounting to five per cent of the voting rights of the Company.

'MASH requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company.

'The notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of the company. The company is currently verifying that the notice is properly constituted.

'If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company's forthcoming annual generl meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course.

'The board is united in its support of the executive team. If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions. A further announcement will be made shortly.'

Wallace, the club's chief executive, has recently held a series of meetings with Paul Murray and George Letham, allies of former director Dave King.

King has offered to invest up to £30m in the club in the past and is now investigating ways to grab control without rewarding the current directors he blames for the club's malaise.

A new share issue has been a stated aim of the board as it seeks to raise funds before another cash shortfall arrives at the end of the year.

That could allow King to make a substantial investment and seize control, but any such move would obviously weaken the existing powerbase at the club.

Ashley already has strong commercial interests at Rangers through retail contracts with Sports Direct. He also owns, but is yet to activate, the naming rights to Ibrox – reportedly purchased for £1 from former chief executive Charles Green.

Ashley’s latest move raises questions as to whether he wants to prevent the board agreeing a deal with King and instead steer them down a different financing route. Wallace and Nash are viewed as being in favour of the option provided by South African-based businessman.

Ashley is currently limited to a Rangers stake of under 10 per cent through an agreement with the SFA, as part of their rules on dual ownership, but it is thought he held unsuccessful talks with the club about a loan prior to last month’s stop-gap share offer that raised £3.13 million.

Ashley did not invest in that process but instead waited to increase his stake by buying shares from fund managers Hargreave Hale - a move which meant his money did not go towards aiding the perilous financial position at Ibrox.

The sportswear tycoon will need the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders if his bid to remove Wallace and Nash is to be successful.

Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board at Rangers, has yet to make any comment about the EGM request but has previously publically stated his support for further involvement by Ashley at Ibrox.

Easdale currently holds voting rights over a shareholding block of around 26 per cent. Should that group all be in favour of axing Wallace and Nash then it would still leave Ashley seeking another 15 per cent.

Laxey Partners are the club’s largest single largest shareholder with just over 16 per cent and have their own representative on the board in Norman Crighton.

The Stock Exchange statement insisted the board was ‘united’ in backing Wallace and Nash. However, with various other shareholder factions now assessing their options, Ashley has fired the first shot in a battle that could prove pivotal to the future direction of Rangers.
