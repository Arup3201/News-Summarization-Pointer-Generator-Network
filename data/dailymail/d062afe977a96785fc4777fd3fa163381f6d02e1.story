He plays bumbling dad Phil Dunphy on ABC's Modern Family, but in Salt Lake City, Ty Burrell is trying out for a role as restaurateur.

Mr Burrell has just opened Beer Bar, a beer garden-like eatery that serves 150 beers paired up with an array of house-made bratwursts, local breads and Belgian fries. The restaurant, which has high ceilings and long tables and benches to evoke that Bavarian beer hall feel, is next door to the cocktail bar the actor co-owns with an equally simple name, Bar X.

'It's a super simple menu, which is what we wanted from the beginning,' says the 46-year-old actor, sporting a scruffy beard and glasses.

Basics: 'It's a super simple menu, which is what we wanted from the beginning,' says the 46-year-old actor, who has lived in Salt Lake City with his wife since 2008

'Basic, but well-made and local. Instead
 of putting the energy into a lot of elements, making sure you have 
fewer elements and you are taking the time to make them right.'

For the menu, the Emmy-winning actor teamed up with Viet Pham, an up-and-coming Salt Lake City chef who was one of Food and Wine magazine's best new chefs in 2011.

Mr Burrell met Mr Pham when he and his wife ate at Forage, the chef's Salt Lake City restaurant, and were blown away by his cooking.

It turned out that Mr Pham was a fan of Bar X, and the seeds for the future partnership were planted.

Mr Pham created what has become Beer Bar's signature dish: the Reuben brat. It's a sandwich stuffed with pastrami, bratwurst, Swiss cheese and pickled vegetables that Mr Burrell says he's already eaten way too many of.

The bar and restaurant cement the actor's
 roots in Salt Lake City, known less for attracting Hollywood types and 
more as host of the 2002 Winter Olympics and home to The Church of Jesus
 Christ of Latter-day Saints.

'There's usually some sort of confusion about why I've opened a bar in Salt Lake'

Though born and raised in Oregon, Mr Burrell says he now feels very much like a 'Salt Laker,' having lived in the city since 2008.

He and his wife, who was born and raised in Utah, live here part of the year with their two young daughters when he is not in Los Angeles filming Modern Family or working on other projects.

'I loved it from the first time I got here,' he said. 'It's a very unassuming place, it's a very humble place.'

Family affair: Beer Bar is right next door to Bar X, the cocktail bar the actor co-owns with his brother Duncan, who also lives in Utah, and a team of business partners

Counter-intuitive: Mr Burrell said he often gets bemused looks from his Hollywood friends when they find out he owns a bar and beer garden in Utah - famous for its teetotaling culture and strict liquor laws

Sense of humor: 'There's usually some sort of confusion about why I've opened a bar in Salt Lake,' he joked

Since he moved here, his mother, brother and a few cousins also relocated to Utah. His brother, Duncan Burrell, is one of his business partners and part of a team that oversees the day-to-day operations of the new restaurant and Bar X, which are joined by a shared door between them.

Mr Burrell said he often gets bemused looks from his Hollywood friends when they find out he owns a bar and beer garden in Utah - famous for its teetotaling culture and strict liquor laws.

'There's usually some sort of confusion about why I've opened a bar in Salt Lake,' he said, laughing.
