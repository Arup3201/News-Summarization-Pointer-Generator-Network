Amjad Bashir, left, with Ukip party leader Nigel Farage, right, before his defection to the Tories

Nigel Farage was rocked last night as one of his Euro MPs defected to the Tories, saying: ‘Ukip is pointless.’

In a major coup for David Cameron, Amjad Bashir jumped ship less than a year after he was elected as a Ukip MEP.

But last night, Bashir’s decision descended into a tit-for-tat battle between the parties. Just hours before news of his defection was due to be made public, Ukip announced they were ‘suspending’ him pending investigations into ‘extremely serious’ allegations.

Bashir, a Pakistani-born businessman, has been one of the few

non-white faces in the senior ranks of Ukip and was used to rebut allegations of racism in the party.

His defection comes four months after two Conservative MPs – Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless – quit to join Ukip. Now Cameron has turned the tables.

It was one of several blows delivered to Farage’s Election hopes last night. First, a senior Ukip official admitted the party was chasing the votes of ‘bigots’. Party secretary Matthew Richardson – who, ironically, was hired to stamp out negative media stories about Ukip – said: ‘People talk about Ukip being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the United Kingdom and they deserve representation.’

Mr Richardson admitted making the remarks, but defended them as ‘the sort of chat people have with their mates while having a drink’.

Then The Mail on Sunday learned that Ukip’s economic spokesman, Patrick O’Flynn, told a meeting in Hampshire that Right-wingers in Ukip are ‘away with the fairies’ – and that many egos in the party were ‘slightly out of control’.

The comments by the pair, both close to Farage, will be seized upon as proof that the party is dominated by extremists. But it is the row over Bashir’s switch that could prove the most damaging.

Ukip immediately went on the offensive against the Euro-MP, making allegations of unanswered financial and employment questions, and interference with the candidate selection process.

Bashir dismissed the claims as ‘a crude attempt to smear me’. Writing in The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision.’

Mr Bashir was suspended by Ukip over unanswered financial employment questions, it emerged on Saturday

Announcing his ‘suspension’, Ukip said: ‘The UK Independence Party has a zero-tolerance policy and takes the matters at hand extremely seriously. The allegations against Mr Bashir are of a grave nature and we will be forwarding our evidence obtained so far to the police.

‘Ukip will not tolerate anyone abusing their positions in the party as we have a firm commitment to differing ourselves from the existing political classes. As a result, Mr Bashir’s involvement with the party was suspended today with immediate effect pending further investigations.’

The news came after Bashir said he was defecting as he agreed with Cameron that a vote for Ukip could put Ed Miliband in No 10.

Bashir said Cameron’s promises on immigration and an in-out referendum on Britain’s EU membership meant there was no longer a need for Ukip – and he suggested the party was essentially a platform for promoting Farage’s personal ambitions.

Bashir, who has represented Yorkshire and the Humber since last May, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I entered public life to campaign for a referendum on Europe and a controlled immigration system.

‘I joined Ukip because I thought it was dedicated to those goals. But I now realise that Ukip is more concerned with furthering its own interests as a political party than delivering for the British people.

‘I have come to the conclusion that it is only with David Cameron and the Conservatives that we can achieve a referendum on Europe, and an immigration system that works for Britain. A vote for Ukip will only deliver a Labour Government, which will deny people a referendum and control over our borders. I have done this with a heavy heart, but I feel I must do right by my country.’

The defection deal was brokered by Tory MEP Dan Hannan and sealed when Bashir met Cameron in the Prime Minister’s constituency office in Oxfordshire on Friday.

Bashir, 62, was Ukip’s spokesman on small businesses. He moved to Bradford aged eight and spent 15 years as a member of the Conservative Party before switching to Ukip two years ago in protest at Cameron’s ‘modernising agenda’.

He said of gay marriage in 2013: ‘It is a big mistake to meddle in an age-old institution.’ He also wanted to cut EU red tape and tighten border controls, saying: ‘We have to seriously restrict immigration to the people who can add value to our country.’

Last year it was revealed that a Manchester curry house run by Mr Bashir’s sons, Tayub and Mudassar, had been fined an undisclosed amount for employing illegal immigrants.

A Ukip party source said Mr Bashir had been aware for some time that he was being investigated and suggested that the suspension was the reason for his defection

Amjad Bashir: 'I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Farage'

I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true. David Cameron famously said that Ukip was a party of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’.

Certainly, I have experienced racism in Ukip. I have been racially abused on social media by other Ukip members who ask offensive questions like: ‘Are you a Muslim?’

I was angry when I was the only Ukip politician who was cut out of a video of speeches at a party event. I complained that it was because of my ethnic minority background, but was fobbed off.

Some of the antics of Ukip MEPs are appalling. They make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards MEPs from other countries when there is no call for it.

I was outraged when I heard Mr Farage talk of a ‘fifth column’ of immigrants in Britain. I have worked hard all my life, and when my father came to this country he worked his socks off to provide for his family. It is an insult for him to talk in this way.

I joined Ukip because I wanted a referendum on the EU and wanted better controls on immigration. But now I have no doubt that Mr Cameron will deliver on this, so, in my view, Ukip has outlived its usefulness.

Mr Farage wants to use Ukip as a means for getting power for himself, and that is not what the party was set up to achieve.

He has created a popularist image for himself as the jolly chap at the bar with a pint in his hand, but the reality is different.

He runs the party like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way.

Ukip is guided more by dogma than common sense.

Since I became an MEP, I have been amazed that Ukip often votes against Britain’s national interest in the European Parliament. For example, we were told to vote against EU money for flood relief schemes in the UK because the money had come from Brussels. I protested that this was ridiculous because much of the EU money was British in the first place, but I was ignored.

And Ukip’s reaction on finding out that I was going to join the Conservatives sums up what is wrong with them. They made a crude attempt to smear me with false allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of Asian members in Bradford.

There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision.

There is no escaping one simple fact: when Mr Cameron said: ‘If you go to bed with Nigel Farage on Election night, you will wake with Ed Miliband the next day,’ he was telling the truth.
