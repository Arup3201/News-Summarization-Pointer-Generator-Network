Not even watching football hooligan film Green Street could dissuade Enner Valencia from moving to West Ham.

The 2005 film, starring Elijah Wood of Lord of the Rings fame, was the 24-year-old striker’s only reference point before signing for £12million from Mexican side Pachuca.

But despite seeing the film about East End hooligans on the rampage, Valencia was very relaxed about arriving at Upton Park.

Valencia's only point of reference before arriving was football hooligan film Green Street

This is a man, after all, who knows that football in this country cannot be any crazier than in his native South America.

Valencia, who had an excellent World Cup with Ecuador, has been barricaded inside stadiums after losing games and says it is a continent where you do not dare show your face after defeat.

‘I was not scared,’ he says when asked about watching Green Street. ‘I respected the fact that they are very passionate but when I found out I was coming here I didn’t know what to expect.

‘But as soon as I arrived I was told that was all back in the day, in the old days, and it has all changed now.

‘When I was playing for my previous club Emelec — it was a derby, the Clasico, and our main rivals (Barcelona SC) were top of the league (in 2012).

‘We had to beat them in order to move on to the same points and we couldn’t get the win. It was very difficult to get everyone out of the stadium.

‘In South America if you lose a match you can’t even go out in the street. At West Ham after we lost the opening game (at home to Tottenham Hotspur) people stayed in the stadium and showed their support. That’s something I really liked.’

It has not taken West Ham fans long to warm to Valencia after his stunning strike from a standing start away at Hull and a good display in the surprise win against Liverpool last week. In his first few games he has done enough to suggest that boss Sam Allardyce has found his missing link.

Valencia has the sort of firepower that should make him a success, and Allardyce hopes he will bring added entertainment to the club alongside Diafra Sakho up front.

Valencia said: ‘I come from a very poor background.

‘I had to go and work with my dad on the farm milking cows. I had to sell the milk and stuff in order to afford to buy my first boots.’ Valencia — who spoke via a translator — is having daily English lessons in a bid to immerse himself in this country’s culture.

‘I can say that it has been a good start, the way that I have adapted to the Premier League.

‘It has been a very good start,’ he said. ‘I was expecting to be able to beat the top teams.’

First Liverpool, then Manchester United. Valencia wouldn’t mind being locked inside Old Trafford if he nets a winner.

Valencia was talking at the launch of West Ham's new members' club - 'Club London' - which offers fans the chance to experience what Brady labelled as an 'unrivalled hospitality experience'.

Season ticket holders and members will soon be able to visit the new Reservation Centre at Westfield Stratford City to hand-pick their new seats at the Olympic Stadium.
