Boris Johnson says Britain ‘betrayed’ the Commonwealth by joining the European Union, and should ‘intensify’ ties with countries such as Australia.

In a provocative newspaper article, the London Mayor said the UK must distance itself from Europe and seek a ‘wider destiny for our country’ further afield.

As Tory ministers seek curbs on uncontrolled migration from EU countries, Mr Johnson said the Government should let in an unlimited number of immigrants from Australia.

A fervent critic of the EU, Mr Johnson said it was time to ‘raise our eyes beyond Europe’ and not think of ourselves as ‘little Europeans run by Brussels’.

‘We betrayed our relationships with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand, and entered into preferential trading arrangements with what was then the European Economic Community,’ he said. Mr Johnson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, has just been on a family holiday in Australia where he was the keynote speaker at the Melbourne Writers’ Festival.

He told how he was approached by Australian Sally Roycroft, who had been teaching at a school in London but was forced to leave the UK because of what he called ‘disgraceful’ immigration rules.

‘She isn’t a citizen of any of the 27 countries of the European Union,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘She is Australian; and she has been told to bog off by the authorities in our country because it was, they said, too much of a palaver to go through the business of “sponsoring” her to stay.

‘That is the infamous consequence, as we all know, of a historic and strategic decision that this country took in 1973’, when Britain joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the EU.

The Mayor said the UK must ‘intensify’ links with the Commonwealth countries, and that ‘you could not do better than by starting with Australia’, calling for freedom of movement between the two countries by setting up a ‘bilateral Free Labour Mobility Zone’.

He added: ‘I suppose there might be some objection from the EU – but they should be told firmly to stuff it. It is basically outrageous and indefensible that Sally Roycroft is deprived of a freedom that we legally confer on every French person.’

Under EU freedom of movement rules, any citizen of a European member state has the right to live and work in the UK.

Just over 20,000 ‘skilled workers’ are each year allowed to come to the UK from outside the EU, but they need to be sponsored by an employer and pass a points-based assessment.
