For any family having to endure the horror of a hit-and-run would be enormously stressful, but to be forced to go through the exact same thing twice in the same week almost beggars belief.

For the Givens family from Philadelphia, such a nightmare became a reality this weekend.

Sarah, 10, was hit by a white SUV as she walked home with a friend on Thursday afternoon.

Two sisters, two hit-and-runs: Kyle, 14 (left) and Sarah, 10 (right) were hit by cars in Philadelphia within days of one another. Police are confident they'll catch the drivers thanks to CCTV capturing both incidents

'I had just started walking across the street when I noticed a white truck zooming down, I got hit and flew up in the air, and I fell under a parked car, that's when I kind of blacked out' she said.

The police have recovered CCTV footage of the incident and saw a White GMC Yukon Denali speeding away.

She was giving details to police about how the hit-and-run driver had careered into her, when the phone rang.

Her sister, Kylie, 14, was crossing the street when she was also struck by another hit-and-run driver who was behind the wheel of a white 4-door sedan with tinted windows.

Sarah Givens, 10: She was struck by a car on Thursday. Luckily she suffered bruising and a broken leg which means no more ice-skating for a couple of months

Kylie Givens, 14: Not quite as lucky as her younger sister, Kylie was struck on Saturday night and is now in intensive care. She is expected to make a full recovery

Their father, Jim, is having difficulty making sense of it all.

He told the Daily News: 'Two daughters in two days. I just couldn't believe it. It's crazy! Why can't these people be grown-ups and turn themselves in? They're just cowards. Cold and heartless.'

Dad, Jim Givens: No sooner was one daughter giving details of her hit-and-run to the police, a phone call informed him that his other daughter had also been knocked down

Incredibly, both sisters survived their ordeals but they will both have to endure painful recoveries.

Sarah's leg was broken in two places and has bruised hips. As a budding figure skater the injuries will mean she'll be off the ice for a couple of months.

She says that she is worried about her sister Kylie whose injuries are far more serious and is in hospital in a critical condition.

She has internal bleeding, doctors have had to remove her spleen and she also has numerous arm and leg injuries.

All on tape: Police are confident they'll catch the drivers involved in both hit-and-run because surveillance cameras captured the whole thing

Although police have not released details of the incident, her family have said that the driver stopped after the accident.

He checked to see if Kylie was still alive before getting back into his car and driving away.

As a result of the past few days, the girls' father Jim is exhausted and looking for answers.

'I just don't know why they didn't stop. Accidents happen, but when you leave, it's not an accident anymore. It's now just a heartless person trying to get away.'
