It may look like an innocuous ballpoint, but despite being disguised to look like a Parker pen it is actually a deadly weapon employed by a North Korean spy in an assassination attempt last year.

Like something straight out of a James Bond film, the pen actually contains a deadly poison which, if injected, leads to almost instant muscle paralysis which in turn leads to suffocation and death.

The weapon, demonstrated to CNN reporters by South Korea's answer to Q, was one of three found on a would-be assassin in Seoul who was targeting Park Sang-hak, an anti North Korea activist.

Deadly: These innocuous looking pens are actually weapons employed by a would-be North Korean assassin assigned to kill Park Sang-hak, a pro-democracy activist

Sneaky: The pen actually injects a toxin which causes muscle paralyses and death within minutes

Potent: A second 'pen' weapon fires a poison-filled bullet which can pierce the skin

As well as the poison pen, Korean authorities also found a second weapon disguised as a Parker pen - but this time with a couple of clicks it fires a poison-filled bullet which can pierce the skin.

The third is a flashlight, loaded with up to three bullets which, when demonstrated by forensics experts on camera, demonstrated extraordinary accuracy and effectiveness.

Although the unnamed South Korean intelligence officer filmed says that the pen weapons are nothing new - Korean authorities have been using them for at least a decade, he says - the flashlight is completely new.

And, far from matching the unmistakable intent of carrying a pistol, the trio of weapons are practically undetectable.

New: A South Korean intelligence officer, whose identity was hidden by CNN, said that he had never seen a weapon such as this, disguised as an innocuous torch

Subterfuge: Instead of shining a light when switched on, the torch fires a bullet at its target

Testing: Forensics experts demonstrated what damage the torch weapon could potentially inflict

On target: The torch weapon was shown to be alarmingly accurate and deadly

The would-be assassin was arrested while allegedly on his way to kill Sang-hak, a former propaganda unit worker for the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth league until 1999 when his father, a government spy, urged his family to defect to South Korea.

Fighting for democracy in his homeland ever since, Sang-hak is chairman of Fighters for a Free north Korea, an organisation behind the release of two million balloons containing human rights and pro-democracy propaganda into North Korea.

He was understandably shocked when shown the weapons which were almost used to try and kill him.

He told CNN: 'You'd notice a gun, but these weapons are so innocuous, you can easily kill someone, I'd be dead immediately.

'I didn't believe they'd try and kill me on the crowded streets of Seoul, I thought the National Intelligence Service was over-reacting.'

Now given round-the-clock police protection, Sang-hak says that he is undeterred in his fight for democracy despite the subterfuge tactics employed by those said to be out to get him.

His would-be killer, named simply as Ahn, was sentenced to four years in jail earlier this year.

Frisked: The weapons were found on a would-be North Korean assassin who was targeting high profile pro-democracy campaigner Park Sang-hak

Disguised: The South Korean intelligence officer who demonstrated the weapons had his identity protected by CNN
