As the New York Post reports, the 
suspect is described as a black man between 25 and 30 years old, about 
5-foot-8 and weighing 200lbs.

He was wearing a black jacket and baseball cap when he fled the scene in a light-colored, four-door sedan, the Post reports.

Authorities say the man is behind a 
string of similar attacks at the Al-Khoei Benevolent Foundation Islamic centre, the 179th Street Deli and a home at 146-62 107th Avenue.

Video of the incident in question was
taken in front of a residence located at 88-20 170th Street.

All of the incidents took place between approximately 8 and 10:15pm on Sunday within a two mile radius.

Police say no one was hurt in the attacks but the house on 107th Avenue caught fire and was badly burned.

Firefighters were called out to the Imam Al-Khoei Foundation building in Queens shortly after 9pm.

The Council on American-Islamic 
Relations says about 80 worshippers were inside the Imam Al-Khoei 
Foundation building when a bottle was thrown at the building which also 
houses a Shiite mosque.

Hate crime: Authorities have offered a $12,000 reward for information leading to the man's arrest and conviction

Fortunate: Police say no one was hurt in the attack

The device caused minor damage to the door and was soon brought under control. No injuries were reported.

The attacks are being investigated as a possible hate crime and detectives.

Governor Andrew Cuomo says the attacks 'have no place in our open and inclusive society'.

There were close to 80 people in the Islamic centre at the time of the attack.

'We had a few members downstairs and 
they heard it. We came out and put out the fire and called 911,' Maan 
Lasahlan, the centreâ€™s minister of religion told the paper.

The development comes after it 
emerged last week that several Muslim leaders refused invitations to the
New York mayor's interfaith breakfast over claims police are spying on 
and infiltrating mosques.

The attack on the Islamic centre in the Queens borough of the city is being investigated as a possible hate crime. Detectives are looking into whether there are possible links to three other fires caused by similar devices that night.

The unnamed imams and activists said 
in a letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg they were disturbed by New York 
Police Department's intelligence-gathering programmes which monitored 
Muslim groups, businesses and houses of worship.

Reports recently revealed 16 police 
officers speaking at least five languages were assigned to use census 
information and government databases to map ethnic neighbourhoods in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Undercover police officers known as 
'rakers' visited local businesses such as Islamic bookstores and cafes, 
talking to store owners to determine their ethnicities and gauge their 
views.

They even played cricket and eavesdropped in cafes and clubs.

Mayor Bloomberg defended the NYPD, saying it didn't take religion into account in its policing.

The Muslim leaders said they although 
they appreciate the mayor's support a year ago during an uproar over a 
planned Islamic centre near the World Trade Center site they were 
disappointed by reports police were infiltrating Muslim neighbourhoods.
