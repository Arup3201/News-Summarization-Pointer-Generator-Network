A man was left stunned after discovering a postcard, which fell out of a book he bought from a charity shop, had originally been sent from his brother to his late mother 25 years ago.

Grandfather-of-five Peter Dodds, 70, bought a biography of Winston Churchill from Ashgate Croft charity shop in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, for 50p - but it wasn'tÂ  until he got it home and started reading it that the postcard fluttered to the floor.

He read the note with general musings about a holiday in Washington DC - and only realised the incredible coincidence when he looked at the address it had been sent to was his mother's.

The card had been sent by his brother, Ian McCollum, 65, to his mother Nellie in 1988 - and Mr Dodds believes Nellie had used it as a bookmark inside his late father's book.

Mr Dodds, a retired salesman who lives in Chesterfield with wife Lorna, 70, a retired home care worker, said: 'I just couldn't believe it. What are the odds of something like that happening?

Recipient:The postcard was originally sent to Nellie McCollum by hers son Ian McCollum when he was visiting Washington DC in 1988

'I was astonished. I got goosebumps - it's unbelievable.'

He explained: 'I often go in to the charity shop to look through the books.

'Like my father, I'm interested in Winston Churchill so that's why I got the book about two weeks ago.

'It wasn't until I was home later that I opened the book to have a read.

'I think the postcard might have been tucked inside the back cover because as I flicked through, it fluttered to the floor.

'I picked it up and I suppose I was just being a bit nosy reading it.

'The postcard had a picture of a statue in Washington, and on the back it said how good the weather was, how Washington was, and joked about how somebody had tried to sell him the statue which was pictured - typical tourist stuff.

'I didn't recognise the names at the bottom because they weren't very clear - but as I looked at the address I couldn't believe it - it was addressed to my mother.

'It was then I realised it was sent to her by Ian and his wife Diane when they were on holiday in 1988.

'I told my wife straight away - she didn't believe me, and I had to show it to her before she would listen properly.

'And as soon as I could, I phoned Ian, and said I've had a postcard from you, from Washington.

'He couldn't understand what I was on about because obviously he hasn't been to America for years.

'As I explained it, he was gobsmacked and said something I couldn't really repeat.'

The postcard is 'immaculate', and Mr 
Dodds believes it must have been used as a bookmark to keep it in such 
good condition. He's given it back to his brother to keep.

Chance find: Mr Dodds discovered the postcard in a biography of Winston Churchill he bought from a charity shop in Chesterfield, Derbyshire

Sender: Ian McCollum holds the postcard he wrote to his mother all those years ago

His mother lived in Chesterfield until she died in 1999, and after her death the brothers donated some of her books to the home's library and somehow the book has made its way to the charity shop.

Mr Dodds believes he gave the book, which was published in 1979, to his father as a present.

'I'd love to know who donated the book and where it's been on its travels. I normally donate my books back to charity but I think I'll be hanging on to this one,' he added.
