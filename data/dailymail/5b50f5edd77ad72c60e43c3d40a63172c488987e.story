Newcastle United’s season is already in danger of unravelling after Siem de Jong was ruled out until Christmas.

The Magpies loaned out playmaker Hatem Ben Arfa and versatile defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa on deadline day but failed to bring in any replacements.

Ben Arfa’s departure in particular has angered supporters after the crowd favourite - exiled to the reserves following a fallout with manager Alan Pardew - was allowed to join Hull City until the end of the season.

Blow: Newcastle United attacking midfielder Siem de Jong has been ruled out for 'a number of months'

Fitness: De Jong sustained a thigh injury and the £6million summer signing from Ajax is out until Christmas

Gone: Newcastle allowed playmaker Hatem Ben Arfa moved to Hull City on loan for the rest of the season

Agreement: Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has also left Tyneside for a season-long loan at Italian giants Roma

But news of De Jong’s injury - a thigh complaint which will seem him sidelined for ‘a number of months’ - is a bitter blow for Pardew in the same week Jack Colback was forced to withdraw from the England squad because of a calf problem.

Despite bringing in seven players during the summer, including £6million De Jong from Ajax, former Newcastle and England defender Steve Howey believes United have left themselves exposed in key areas.

‘We all thought the business they did early was very impressive,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘But they have known for a long time now that they need a goalscorer and cover at centre-back.

‘Neither of these issues were addressed and they are a couple of injuries away from having some serious problems.

‘The De Jong injury is a massive blow, especially on the back of Ben Arfa leaving and fans will be quick to jump on that.’

Goals: Newcastle look short of firepower following De Jong's (centre) injury ruled him out for months

Out of favour: Playmaker Ben Arfa had been exiled to the reserves by manager Alan Pardew at Newcastle

Ben Arfa’s contract expires at the end of the season and he has played his last game for Newcastle.

Howey, though, feels fans must trust Pardew and his backroom team when it comes to the French midfielder.

‘You’ve got to remember that the manager sees his players every day and he’d obviously decided there was nothing else he could do with Ben Arfa,’ he said.

‘It’s a shame because he’s a top, top player and the fans loved him. It’s left them short up front now and I just fear the season could be ruined by not having enough goals in the team.’

Howey’s former team-mate Rob Lee, however, believes Pardew should have taken the same approach with Ben Arfa as Kevin Keegan did with temperamental French winger David Ginola during the mid-90s at St James’ Park.

‘The first thing Kevin did every morning was to tell David how much he loved him,’ said Lee.

‘He put his arm around the Frenchman and whispered nice things in his ear. Kevin’s reward was that David was absolutely brilliant.

‘I don’t care if his attitude wasn’t always great or the fact he was never going to run back 50 yards to put in a tackle. Ben Arfa should have been told he was loved. I bet that’s what Steve Bruce is doing every morning down at Hull.’

Meanwhile, a club statement on De Jong’s injury read: ‘Siem de Jong sustained an injury to his right thigh in training and is to be assessed further at the start of next week.

‘Initial indications are that he is likely to be out for a number of months.’
