Hollywood actor Robert Wagner has declined to be interviewed by detectives in a fresh inquiry into the drowning death of his film star wife Natalie Wood three decades ago.

Mr Wagner - who is best known for starring in the television shows 'It Takes a Thief' and 'Switch' - was interviewed by authorities soon after Ms Wood's drowning in 1981.

But the actor is the only person who was on the yacht the night she died who has not spoken to detectives as part of the latest inquiry, according to investigators - despite repeated requests.

Beaten: Ms Wood, seen here in 1962, had bruises on her wrists, knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten, according to a new coroner's report released in January

Blair Berk, an attorney for Mr Wagner and his family, said the actor had cooperated with authorities since his wife died.

Detectives began re-investigating the case in November 2011. Since then 
investigators have interviewed more than 100 people, but Mr Wagner has 
refused and Sheriff's Lt. John Corina has said the actor's representatives have not given any 
reason for his silence.

The detective's remarks provided new insight into the case that has 
remained one of Hollywood's enduring mysteries. Earlier this week, 
coroner's officials released an updated autopsy report that had been 
under a security hold.

It detailed why Ms Wood's death had been 
reclassified from an accidental drowning to a drowning caused by 'undetermined factors.'

'Mr. Wagner has fully cooperated over the last 30 years in the investigation of the accidental drowning of his wife in 1981,' Berk said in a prepared statement.

'Mr. Wagner has been interviewed on multiple occasions by the Los Angeles sheriff's department and answered every single question asked of him by detectives during those interviews.'Â 

Fatal: This is the yacht Splendor that Ms Wood and Mr Wagner were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off Santa Catalina Island over Thanksgiving weekend in 1981

Dangerous: Ms Wood reportedly could not swim. Her body was found floating in the water near Catalina Island hours after she went overboard

After 30 years, Berk said, neither 
Mr Wagner nor his daughters have any new information to add. She said the 
latest investigation was prompted by people seeking to exploit and 
sensationalize the 30th anniversary of the death.

The renewed inquiry came after the yacht's captain Dennis Davern told '48 Hours' and the 'Today' show that he heard Mr Wagner and Ms Wood arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Mr Wagner was to blame for her death. The authorities have not identified any suspects in the case.

Confession: Dennis Davern, the skipper of the yacht, says he lied to police about what happened the night Ms Wood drowned

Ms Wood, 43, was on a yacht with Mr Wagner,
 Christopher Walken and the boat captain on Thanksgiving weekend of 1981
 before she somehow ended up in the water.

Lt Corina said Mr Walken gave a prepared statement and spoke to detectives for an hour.

Detectives have also interviewed other actors who knew both Mr Wagner and Ms Wood to learn more about their relationship.

Lt Corina said detectives have tried at least ten times to interview Mr Wagner but have been refused. He said some of the refusals have come from the actor's attorney, and that detectives at one point traveled to Colorado to try to speak with Mr Wagner but were unsuccessful.

LtCorina said the latest inquiry had turned up new evidence.

'Most of the people we've talked to were never talked to 30 years ago,' he said. 'We've got a lot of new information.'

Asked if the information might lead to criminal charges, Lt Corina said that would be up to prosecutors if they are presented with a case.

'All we can do is collect the facts,' he said. 'We're still trying to collect all the facts.'

Lt Corina said new people have emerged with information each time the case is in the news. Detectives would like to interview other people who have not agreed to talk, he said.

Coroner's officials released an updated autopsy report on Monday that detailed the reasons why Ms Wood's death certificate was changed last year from a drowning death to 'drowning and other undetermined factors.'

The updated report states the change was made in part because investigators could not rule out that some of the bruises and marks on Ms Wood's body happened before she went into the water.

Tragic: New information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that Ms Wood's death was accidental (pictured here with Mr Wagner)

'Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined,' Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran wrote in the report completed in June.

Officials also considered that Ms Wood was not wearing a life jacket, had no history of suicide attempts and didn't leave a note as reasons to amend the death certificate.

She was famous for roles in films such as 'West Side Story' and 'Rebel Without a Cause' and was nominated for three Academy Awards.

Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of her death. Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and Mr Walken had all been drinking heavily in the hours before the actress disappeared.

Mr Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Mr Walken argued that night. He wrote that Mr Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but that when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy that had been attached to the yacht were missing.

'Nobody knows,' he wrote. 'There are only two possibilities; either she was trying to get away from the argument, or she was trying to tie the dinghy. But the bottom line is that nobody knows exactly what happened.'

The setup: On November 28, 1981, the 60-foot yacht Splendor set out for Santa Catalina Island, a rocky island off the coast of California, 22 miles from Los Angeles. Aboard were Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood and the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern. The couple also brought Ms Wood's newest costar, Christopher Walken, to celebrate their successful completion of filming for 'Brainstorm,' a science fiction thriller.

Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and Mr Walken departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore, where they had dinner at Harbor Reef Resultant on the island. Waitresses reported that all three Hollywood actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous.

Witnesses say all three were very intoxicated at about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht, which was anchored offshore. Exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery.

The tragedy: Ms Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht at about 8am on November 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia.

Her blood alcohol level at the time was 
0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving. She also had 
motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system, which likely 
increased her level of intoxication. The time of death is estimated at about midnight at on November 29.

'The fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight, especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm,' according to the new report.

However, Ms Wood was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard, according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore.
