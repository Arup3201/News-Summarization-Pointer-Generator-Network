An American home builder has decided to capitalize on the puppy pampering phenomenon by offering specially fitted amenities for dogs, on top of the usual optional extras buyers can expect.

Standard Pacific Homes is building homes across the country from Florida to California offering the suites, costing up to $35,000, which include features such as showers  for puppies and automated feeders.

The company, based in Irvine, California say they decided to offer pet suites after conducting livability studies with home owners.

The suites can come complete with a washing station for small dogs, left, and special dog cubby holes can be created on the staircase, right 

The washing stations can also be adapted to accommodate bigger dogs so pet owners don't have to use their own bath or kitchen sink 

Jeffrey Lake, vice president and national director of architecture for Standard Pacific said: 'Devotion to pets is second-to-none. They are family.'

One of the most lavish suites that can be installed is described as a 170-square-foot pet paradise, which comes complete with a step-in wash station, a handheld sprayer and a leash lead.

It also has a water station and automated feeders so pets never go hungry or thirsty, a large bunk-style bed and special cabinets for treats and food.

Meanwhile other home builders have reported adapting already-built houses for pet owners with features such as chip activated doors so dogs can go outdoors whenever they please.

Cabinets and cupboards in the suites are fitted at the right height so that dogs can have easy access to them, left, while a built-in crate at the bottom of the stairs, right, allows the dog to see who is coming in and out of the front door 

Standard Pacific Homes' newest community, called Avignon at Blackstone in Brea, about 25 miles south of Los Angeles, features homes that start at $710,000. The pet spa option adds $35,000 to the price.

Only the largest suite is available in Brea, but in some of the other communities, there are smaller sizes and prices, starting at 60 square feet for $8,000.

During some of the model grand openings at different communities, several potential buyers brought their dogs to look at the homes, said Danielle Tocco, the company's director of communications.

The American Pet Products Association reports that 68 per cent of Americans own pets and contribute to an industry worth more than $55 billion annually

She also added that pet adoptions were held at some openings just in case potential buyers didn't have a dog but wanted one.

One pet owner who splashed out on a pet package for their dog Lola is Melanie Dean, who lives with her family in a Standard Pacific Home near Dallas.

She said: 'Lola's room makes life much easier. We don't have to use the kitchen sink to wash yucky stuff anymore.'

Amy Bohutinsky, chief marketing officer at Seattle-based Zillow said pet washrooms can also be used as multi-purpose rooms, which are always popular with buyers

But despite the additional features being aimed specifically at dogs, estate agents believe the suites can add value to the price of homes.
