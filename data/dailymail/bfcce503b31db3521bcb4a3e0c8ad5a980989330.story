A prototype ‘bouncy’ space module is to be tested aboard the International Space Station, NASA has announced.

The inflatable module is being heralded as a key component of future exploration and the development of commercial space travel and research.

It is designed by Bigelow Aerospace, based in Las Vegas, which has been awarded a $17.8 million contract.

Inflatable space modules are intended to provide more room for the astronauts based in them.

Lori Garver, NASA’s deputy administrator, said as she unveiled the contract award that the inflatable module concept is simultaneously cutting edge technology and affordable.

‘This partnership agreement for the use of expandable habitats represents a step forward in cutting-edge technology that can allow humans to thrive in space safely and affordably, and heralds important progress in U.S. commercial space innovation,’ she said.

‘The International Space Station is a unique laboratory that enables important discoveries that benefit humanity and vastly increase understanding of how humans can live and work in space for long periods.’

Part of NASA’s interest in the inflatable technology is prompted by its potential for deep space missions.

The experimental unit, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, is intended to be easily launched because it takes up much less room than conventional space craft yet once in orbit is inflated to be much bigger.

Bigelow hopes that while providing practical solutions to space research, the modules will also serve as craft that can provide accommodation and working space for astronauts in orbit.

Two or more inflatables could be linked up to provide extra working and living space.

Its stated aim is ‘to provide affordable options for spaceflight to national space agencies and corporate clients’.

Previously, the company has launched two other inflatable modules but this is the first time it will be tested as part of a manned craft.

Genesis 1 was launched in in 2006 and Genesis 2 in 2007, both on Russian rockets, and are still in orbit.

Echo 1, launched in 1960 was the first inflatable space craft. The NASA communication satelite rose 1,000 miles into space as a balloon. It was dubbed a ‘sateloon’.

In 1961 an inflatable space station was proposed and a prototype built by NASA. It was intended to be manned by one or two astronauts but it was never launched.

With the development of kelvar and other materials, the inflatable concept was revived in the 1990s, with NASA creating the TransHab. Budget cuts meant it was scrapped in 2000.

Each has been tested to ensure a constant temperature and pressure can be maintained within the inflatable hull.

Bigelow last year announced a link up with the SpaceX company which is working to create Dragon spacecraft that can carry passengers into space.

The intention was that SpaceX would transport people into space where they would transfer to orbiting Bigelow inflatables.

Among the potential projects that Bigelow is looking at is building a base on the moon constructed from a series of linked inflatable modules.

Initially it would be expected that inflatable Moon bases would be for research but with several companies planning to take tourists into orbit they could eventually be used as 'space hotels'.
