Fire crews closed off a road and mounted an 11-man rescue operation to come the aid of a pigeon trapped above a restaurant.

In farcical scenes, reminiscent of the 1970s' cartoon Stop The Pigeon, onlookers watched as the area came to a standstill while fire fighters helped save the bird.

The chaos began when staff at a Pizza Express, in Bournemouth, Dorset, noticed the pigeon and alerted the RSPCA and the RSPB who then called the fire brigade.

Chaotic: An aerial ladder was carefully moved into position so fire fighter could get to the trapped bird

Trapped: This was the reason behind the rescue mission - a pigeon that had become caught behind netting

Once officers arrived, work began to release the bird, which had become caught behind netting.

Two
fire engines with an aerial ladder platform turned up and officers took an RSPCA officer up to the building's third storey.

RSPCA inspector Jo Story, who went up with the firemen, said they discovered a dead bird while they released the trapped one.

Jo said: 'Unfortunately when something is up that high there’s nothing I can do but call the fire brigade.

Emergency call out: Work began to release the bird that had become trapped in netting

Rescue operation: An RSPCA officer moves into position, aided by the fireman ladder

The road was closed while 11 fire fighters from two different stations were called to the rescue operation

'Thankfully they are always willing to come out and help if they are not doing anything more urgent.

'I know a lot of people will see this as a lot of effort for a pigeon but from the RSPCA’s point of view, a life is a life.'

A spokeswoman from Dorset Fire and Rescue service said: 'We went along to a road in the town centre because there was a pigeon stuck.

'The RSPCA had called us and we used an aerial ladder platform we were using for training nearby to rescue the bird.'
