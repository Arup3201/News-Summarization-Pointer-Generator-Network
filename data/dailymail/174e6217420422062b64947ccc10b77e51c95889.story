QPR have agreed an £8million fee with Norwich City for defensive midfielder Leroy Fer.

Manager Harry Redknapp has been pursuing the Holland international throughout the summer.

He had an initial £4m offer turned down and then a further proposal of cash plus midfielder Karl Henry.

Fer, 24, was part of Holland's World Cup squad under Louis van Gaal and is keen on a return to the Premier League.

Big move: Leroy Fer is closing in on a big money move to Harry Redknapp's Queens Park Rangers

Key target: QPR boss Redknapp is looking to bring in a few more signing before the transfer window shuts

He signed for Norwich last summer after missing out on a move to Everton the previous January following a knee injury.

QPR have spoken to Lokomotiv Moscow about Lassana Diarra but he would need to take a pay cut to move to Loftus Road. QPR have also joined Arsenal by showing an interest in Napoli's Chile international striker Eduardo Vargas.

Meanwhile, goalkeeper Julio Cesar is poised to sign for Benfica. The 34-year-old Brazil goalkeeper has a contract until 2016 but he has not been part of the club’s plans for more than a year. 

Benfica opened initial talks in July prior to the World Cup but were struggling to agree his £100,000 a week wages. Now they have returned with a compromise and hope to ratify the signing over the coming days.
