Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running and is proving to be worth every penny of the £32million spent by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. But can he really be as good as Thierry Henry? 

With that in mind, Sportsmail asked Arsenal fan Bob Allcock of Just Arsenal to tell us what he makes of the idea. Can Sanchez become as big a legend as Henry? Let's see what Bob thinks.

As the Arsenal and Chile international star Alexis Sanchez grabbed yet another game by the scruff of the neck and shook it mercilessly at the Emirates against Stoke City, he was watched by the last player able to thrill the Arsenal fans in a similar way: Thierry Henry.

The former France international was there with another Gunners legend, Robert Pires, as a guest of the club and I wonder what they made of the latest incredible display by Arsenal’s new strike star.

They cannot fail to have been impressed with Alexis putting in his usual workload, which any combative central midfield general would be proud of. And that is what really makes him different and suggests to the Arsenal fans that we have finally found a player that can have the same influence as the great man who recently hung up his boots.

Henry used to light up a pitch in the way that very few players can but Alexis has that too, like the incredible run and finish for his second goal against Stoke. 

Football fans always love a player who gives their all, but when that player can also do things that nobody else can, he truly becomes something special and we take him to our heart.

As I remember, it took a lot longer for the Arsenal fans to really warm to Henry, although he was younger and was more of a winger or wide forward when Wenger brought him to the Premier League.

With Sanchez, though, it was almost instant because of the effort and dynamism he showed from the very start.

A cutting edge helps, of course, so when he scored the only goal of the two-legged play-off against Besiktas to book Arsenal another place in the Champions League group stage, another box was ticked off.

Someone suggested on our website a few days ago that Alexis had yet to prove himself for Arsenal against the big teams to really start to be compared with Henry. But they seem to have forgotten his stunning volley that gave us the lead against Manchester City in September. 

How about the second goal against Borussia Dortmund in a massive game that kept Arsenal hopes of progressing to the knockout stage alive? 

To suggest that Sanchez does not have a big-game mentality is just wrong.

I cannot think of a player with a better or more consistent attitude and I believe that he would give his all against Real Madrid in a final in the same way he would on an away trip to Doncaster in a rainy FA Cup replay, because he loves the game.

And he seems to have found his perfect home with Arsenal, where he does not have to play second fiddle to Lionel Messi and is fully appreciated by his adoring fans. 

You can only wonder what the Barca fans now think after seeing him explode on to the Premier League stage, when they used to greet him with lukewarm applause at best.

I firmly believe that Alexis can have the same sort of impact for Arsenal as Henry had. He may not have enough time to break the Frenchman’s scoring record and he needs to keep producing every season, but without injury problems to stop him and as long as he has the team-mates around to back him up, Alexis will be an Arsenal great and will surely lead the Gunners back to glory…
