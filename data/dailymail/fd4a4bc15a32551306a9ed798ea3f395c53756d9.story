Comedian Alan Davies yesterday apologised to Lord McAlpine for a tweet that wrongly branded the Tory peer a paedophile.

Davies, who starred in the BBC crime drama Jonathan Creek, also agreed to pay £15,000 damages, which will be donated to the Chelsea Pensioners at Lord McAlpine’s request.

The former Conservative Party deputy chairman began a libel action against Davies following a frenzy of speculation last November as people expected a senior politician to be exposed as a paedophile on Newsnight.

Davies has paid damages to Lord McAlpine after he 're-tweeted' a post that wrongly branded the Tory peer a paedophile

Beforehand, Davies, 47, sent a message on the social networking site Twitter saying: ‘Any clues who this Tory paedophile is...?’

He then re-tweeted, or re-sent, a reply from one individual which said ‘Lord McAlpine, some would say’ to his 400,000 followers.

At the High Court, his lawyer, Steve Hudson, said: ‘Mr Davies withdraws the allegation unreservedly, and apologises sincerely to Lord McAlpine for the great damage and distress which his tweeting caused him.’

Lord McAlpine’s lawyer, Andrew Reid, said: ‘There still remain people influenced by this tweet. Mr Davies has irresponsibly fanned the work of the internet trolls who seem to be able to act with immunity from prosecution.’

On Tuesday, Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow also apologised to Lord McAlpine for her tweet and agreed to pay £15,000.
