A six-year-old Boston girl managed a miraculous recovery after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest in her school playground and now wants to warn others of her condition.

Teachers rushed to help Olivia Quigley, of Winthrop, Massachusetts, who dropped to the floor as she played ball with her fellow first-graders at East Boston Central Catholic School.

Bobby Casaletto and Kathy Carabine recognized that Olivia was in sudden cardiac arrest and made the wise call to implement their medical emergency response plan and immediately administer CPR before attempting to move her.

Proud pair: Olivia Quigley and her father Joe are raising awareness of her condition which can cause a sudden cardiac arrest. She was lucky teachers were on hand after suffering an episode four years ago

Their actions saved the life of the little girl who was later diagnosed with a rare heart condition called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or CPVT, which can trigger cardiac arrest at any time.

'If they'd waited five minutes, Olivia wouldn't have survived,' her father Joe Quigley said at the time.

'I was completely unaware that her school had a plan,' he told ABC News today - the fourth anniversary of the incident. 'It's not something I thought to ask, but I am so thankful they did. Cardiac arrest isn't rare, survival is.'

On February 13 2009, Mr Quigley and his wife, Cathy, didn't realize anything was wrong with their little girl beyond the usual 'coughs and colds'. In fact, two days before she had been given the all-clear in her annual check up.

But when he received the call from her school that afternoon he knew something wasn't right.

Battling illness: Now 10, Olivia Quigley fund-raises for the American Heart Association and calls for schools to be trained in dealing with conditions that cause sudden cardiac arrest

'You dread getting that phone call 
from the school. I remember every word,' said Quigley, a part-time 
bartender. 'I knew it wasn't just that she fell over and hurt her leg. 
It was something serious.'

It turns out their youngest child was
carrying a potentially fatal heart condition which kills 30 per cent of
those in their first attack.

Teachers at her elementary school kept her alive before medics arrived with a defibrillator.

In hospital she suffered another cardiac arrest and was put on life support.  

Her family were unsure of what her condition would be when she regained consciousness.

She was unable to walk and had issues with short term memory loss but miraculously has since achieved a full recovery.

Olivia, now 10, and her family are promoting awareness of the illness and the work of the American Heart Association which is researching the condition.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or CPVT is a condition where the rhythm of the heart is disrupted

It is thought to be the cause for 15% of all unexplained cardiac arrests in young people

It is linked to moments of physical activity or emotional stress and in the majority of cases has a genetic cause

Sufferers are advised to avoid all 
forms of vigorous physical activity and can be implanted with devices to
measure the heart and given beta-blockers

Sufferers have a tendency of 
fainting during exercise and often have relatives who have suffered from
similar symptoms or sudden cardiac arrest. However, for many the first 
sign of the illness is a sudden heart attack

Sudden cardiac arrests claim the lives of 300,000 a year in the U.S. alone

They also want to draw attention to the need for emergency medical response plans in schools.

'It can happen again at any time,' said Mr Quigley. 'All you can do is be prepared for it.'

Olivia now wears an implant to keep track of her heart rhythm and to automatically shock it back if she goes into cardiac arrest.

'Sometimes in gym, she'll say, 'I'll need to sit this one out,' when her heart is racing a bit or she is feeling a little faint. But it doesn't happen very often,' Mr Quigley added.

'Initially, she was concerned that that she wasn't like everyone else -- that she was different, somehow. So I say, 'You are different because this happened to you.' Let's look at the positive side of what you can do.' 

'She is getting the word out that school staff should be trained in CPR, and schools should have AEDs and an emergency medical response plans. She's putting herself out there.'

The family are still concerned they can't find the origin of Olivia's illness.

The condition is usually genetic but she was tested and nothing came back positive.

That's why they are backing research by the American Heart Association.

'Although it is comforting to know that she is getting the correct treatment, not having a diagnosis is still a big worry,' Mr Quigley told the charity's blog. 

'Olivia has a 15 year old brother, Alex, and not having a diagnosis for Olivia means that he could also be carrying the same genetic problems. He could just be a time bomb waiting to go off.'
