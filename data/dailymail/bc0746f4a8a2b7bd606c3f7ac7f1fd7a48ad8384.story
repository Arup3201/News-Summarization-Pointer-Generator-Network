Britain will become more involved in the battle against Islamic State militants, but ground troops will not be deployed into Iraq and Syria, the Defence Secretary said today.

Michael Fallon said the UK's involvement against IS fighters in Iraq will continue to be in a supportive role, by RAF planes taking part in air strikes, and helping to arm Kurdish troops.

The Defence Secretary said western countries had learned from previous conflicts that the war against Isis would only be won by 'home troops', but that Britain and the U.S. can support them.

His comments come after Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, admitted there was nothing the international coalition fighting IS militants can do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for the strategically important Syrian town of Kobane.

IS is threatening to overrun the lightly-armed Kurdish defenders of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey, despite United States air strikes on the extremists' position.

The battle has sparked major protests in Turkey against its government's perceived inaction and US secretary of state John Kerry said he was deeply concerned about the situation.

Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fallon said neighbouring countries had a duty to stop Iraq and Syria 'falling apart', but stopped short of urging Turkey to get involved in the conflict. 

'Turkey could help, but it's a matter for Turkey,' he said.

'Other allies have been helping, from the south Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia were helping with strikes.

'This is a situation that can not be resolved by America and Britain. We'd like Turkey to be involved, but it's a decision for their government.'

Mr Fallon said there had been talks with the Turkish government, and that Ankara is 'very aware' of the 'desperate' situation in Kobane.

'They will have to see whether they can help more,' he said.

He added: 'Every country has its own position and comes to this from its own position. They have had difficulty with Kurdish extremism in the past, such as hostages.

'Every country in the region has got to see what it can contribute against ISIL or we will have Iraq falling apart and Syria falling apart and that's a danger for the entire region.'

Mr Fallon said that it was in Britain's interest for Iraq and Syria not to collapse at the hands of IS, but said the Armed Forces would continue to act in a supportive role.

'There is a very direct British interest in making sure the Middle East does not fall apart, and that terrorism is not exported back to Western Europe,' he said.

'The legitimate government in Iraq will have asked for help, I don't think it would be right for Britain with its air power and other resources to stand apart and leave it to the Bahrainis or the Americans.'

He added: 'We're not portraying ourselves as the saviours of the Middle East, we are helping.'

Mr Fallon said ground forces would ultimately be the ones to push back IS, but maintained that British soldiers would not be involved in this.

'This can only be won in the end by ground forces, but it can only be won by the home army not an army from the West.

'That is the hard lesson we have learned.

'We can stiffen up the army, supply ammunition to Kurdish forces and use air power to provide support for operations on the ground.

Air power: Mr Fallon said RAF flights have been flying on missions out of Akrotiri 'every day and night'

'We can help, and we should help. 

'We have got to keep reviewing the campaign. At the moment we are here at the request of the Iraqi government and air power is a key part of that, as is stiffening up the Iraqi army and making sure it is properly equipped.'

Mr Fallon also said British action would continue to focus on Iraq, rather than Syria.

'We have made it clear that ISIS has to be defeated in Syria and Iraq but we don't have the authority to support in Syria at the moment.

'There is plenty for us to do in Iraq and the RAF are flying missions every day and night. There is plenty for us to be getting on with in Iraq and pressure from ISIL is coming from bases in Syria. That's why we welcome what America is doing there.'

He added: 'If we find there is a contribution we can make in Syria and it is lawful we can do it, but at the moment we don't have the authority from Parliament.'

Asked if Britain would become more involved in the fight against IS militants he said: 'This is the international community's fight and the collapse of Iraq, or if Syria gets worse, that will affect us all.

'There could be terrorist strikes across Western Europe as (IS fighters) are returning to countries as far apart as Norway and Australia.'

Mr Fallon said the proposal for a Turkish 'buffer zone' along the border inside Syria where refugees fleeing the fighting could be protected was being considered.

He said that US special envoy to Syria, former general John Allen, would be holding talks with the Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to establish what contribution Ankara would make to the coalition. 

Foreign Secretary: Philip Hammond admitted that the coalition's focus on air strikes meant there was nothing it could do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for Kobani and acknowledged the town could fall to IS

'We have the air power to help with it,' he said.

'That's something General Allen is discussing with the Turkish government today. 

Last night, Mr Hammond admitted that the coalition's focus on air strikes meant there was nothing it could do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for Kobani and acknowledged the town could fall to IS.

He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: 'The US has implemented some additional air strikes to try and help the people who are defending Kobani but it is a very difficult situation on the ground and we have never envisaged that the coalition's intervention with air power in this battle was going to turn the tide in the short term.

'We have got to degrade ISIL's military capability over time, that isn't going to happen overnight.

'So I don't want to suggest that there is anything readily that the coalition can do that will make a fundamental difference on the ground in this battle, in the tactical situation that's faced around Kobani.'

He said: 'Self evidently it could fall. The Americans are committed to doing what they can to support the defence the town with additional air strikes.

'But this is a long struggle here against a poisonous ideology and an organisation which has built up some very significant military capabilities.

'Although we the coalition are confident that we will win that strategic battle we cannot say with confidence that we will be able to win any specific tactical engagement.'

Both Mr Kerry and Mr Hammond have reacted cautiously to a Turkish proposal to establish a 'buffer zone'. 

'If Syrian citizens can return to Syria and be protected in an area across the border there's a lot that would commend that,' he said.

'But at the same time you'd have to guarantee safety, guarantee there wouldn't be attacks by the government.

'It needs a thorough examination.'

Mr Hammond added: 'We would have to explore with other allies and partners what is meant by a buffer zone, how such a concept would work, but I certainly wouldn't want to rule it out at this stage.'

Meanwhile, the Foreign Secretary sought to reassure the US that Britain would be prepared to join air strikes on Is militants in Syria, if requested by American commanders.

Mr Hammond indicated ministers would be prepared to go back to Parliament to seek permission to extend British military action into Syria if US Central Command (Centcom) considered it 'militarily useful'.

'We absolutely have not ruled out playing a role in Syria,' he said.

'We will require further parliamentary approval if we decide that that is the right thing for us to do.

'We would see this as a military question - is there a militarily useful role that UK assets could play.

'If Centcom commanders see a specific role for UK military assets I am sure that they will not be slow in requesting them.'
