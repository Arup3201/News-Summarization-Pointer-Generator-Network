As HR Director ‘Lipgloss’ Lucy Adams was labelled a liar by a Parliamentary committee, it was not only sections of the BBC newsroom that cheered in agreement.

For watching a recording of the mauling was Steve Vear, her third husband.

Speaking for the first time about their marriage, Mr Vear claims he fell ‘completely and madly in love’ with the £320,000-a-year executive before being ‘written out of her life’.

Head of sales in the UK for a multinational optical firm, Mr Vear, who earns a six-figure salary, met Ms Adams in September 2008 and they were instantly attracted to each other after their first date at a dancing class.

‘She did salsa but I wanted to learn how to do ballroom dancing and she jumped straight in,’ the 51-year-old recalled.

‘I could tell there was something between us and I was attracted to her.

‘I went to meet her at her house in Fulham two nights after and never really left.’

Mr Vear said it soon became clear that Ms Adams, who has a daughter from a previous marriage, had expensive tastes, as proved when the pair got engaged.

‘It was Valentine’s Day on the beach in Marbella. I remember being very nervous and I picked a ring, which cost £200, the same day. 

‘The first thing she did when she got back was go to Hatton Garden and buy a new ring. I never saw the receipt but I reckon it must have cost between £15,000 and £20,000.

She just said she’d always wanted a ring with massive diamonds and would I mind? I wasn’t really thinking that straight because I was so in love with her.

I didn’t question it, I just thought if that’s what she wants to do let her get on with it. She had it cut the same way as the ring I gave her, but obviously you don’t get much of a diamond for £200.’

Mr Vear, who has been married three times and has two children from his first marriage, added Ms Adams certainly lived up to her ‘Lipgloss’ nickname and the couple had a ‘fairytale wedding’ when they tied the knot in December 2009 in Putney, South-West London.

‘Lucy wanted a winter wedding with candles everywhere. It cost about £20,000. Then we had a really expensive ten-day honeymoon in the Maldives and the villa cost about £1,200 a night,’ he said.

‘I’d never heard of the expression Lipgloss Lucy but it’s not one I’d disagree with. She’d never go anywhere without make-up. I bought her a £150 tub of face cream once as a present from Harrods and she just kept on buying it.

‘And she had an entire bedroom at her home turned into a dressing room where she kept all her designer handbags and shoes. Most of her bags came from Harrods and Selfridges.

She must have had around 25, costing £1,000 upwards.’

Ms Adams, who was overseeing a major overhaul at the BBC, could have been excused for losing sleep.

But Mr Vear confessed it was more mundane marriage problems that kept her awake at night. ‘She oversaw massive changes to the BBC pension system as well as pay freezes and job cuts.

But none of that really fazed her. What seemed to upset her more was my snoring,’ he said.

The end of their brief marriage still haunts Steve after he found out about her affair with PR director Andrew Powell. And he says since their split in the summer of 2011 they have had just one conversation and exchanged a handful of texts.

‘About three weeks before I found out, I was sitting in a Chinese restaurant in London with her and said, “Is there anything I should know about? Something doesn’t seem right.” And she said, “Absolutely not”.

‘But it was only when I was in Spain that I actually discovered her lover’s underpants. I was going through the dirty washing and his white boxer shorts were in the laundry basket. I also found a boarding ticket with both their names on and I looked him up on the internet.

‘I left them on her side of the bed. She didn’t say a word and I thought, “If you have had an affair I’m not going to beg you to stay so get on with it.” A few days later she finally said, “You left them there and you didn’t say anything. If you want a conversation, have a conversation.” 

‘It felt like she was just rubbing my nose in it. We loved that place – it was in the hills overlooking Marbella. I found it but we both picked it together. And she took him there.

‘The very same day Lucy told me I went to see a solicitor and said I wanted a divorce. I only found out later she’s still with the same guy. That betrayal knocked me for  six and it’s taken a long time to get over.

‘I’ve got a new girlfriend but I know I’m difficult to live with and find myself swinging between not caring and being over-controlling and I’m sure that’s because of what Lucy did.’

The divorce papers acknowledge Ms Adams’s affair ended the marriage. Mr Vear said he accepted £25,000 cash to clear debts while she kept the £200,000 two-bed flat in Spain. 

He said: ‘I knew she was a piece of work but I never honestly believed she would do anything like that. Maybe I was naive. She said she was madly, deeply in love with me, like I was with her.

‘Lucy was handbags and shoes and fancy holidays. I didn’t know how well paid she was. She kept it a secret for the first few months. 

‘What she earned made no difference to me – we just had a lot in common. Now I feel like she is trying to write me out of it.’

Ms Adams did not respond to requests for a comment.
