The African-American teenager shot dead by a white policeman in a killing which sparked riots in St. Louis posted a haunting message on Facebook just days before he died.

Michael Brown wrote in a Facebook message: 'If I leave this earth today, at least you'll know I care about others more than I cared about my damn self.'

Friends told MailOnline that the message was 'typical' of Michael and that he was selfless and always willing to help others.

'Big teddy bear': Michael's family said he was 'meek and quiet' despite his 6ft 4ins frame. He often posted pictures of him and a little niece he clearly adored on Facebook

He was a 'gentle giant' - timid and quiet yet 6ft 4 tall and 300lbs - raising the possibility that the cop who killed him may have been intimidated by his size.

But to those around him, there was nothing in his nature that was violent.

Monday would have been Michael's first day at college in the first step towards his dream of one day opening his own business.

But all those hopes were dashed in one confrontation on a street in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri on Saturday with a white policeman.

The killing was the spark that ignited long-running tensions with the police department and set off three nights of rioting, looting and the protests of an entire community demanding justice.

Family and friends have complained that amid the rage, tear gas and street battles, their son is being forgotten.

Michael’s mother Lesley McSpadden and father, Michael Sr, are divorced but in their grief their love for their son has reunited them.

The case has now drawn the attention of President Obama who said in a statement that it was 'heartbreaking'. After being shown the message Lesley nodded her head approvingly.

Standing outside of her mother’s home, where Michael was walking to when he was shot dead, Lesley told MailOnline: 'We are going to make a lot of noise about this. This isn’t going away'.

Her determination is all too apparent: on the back window of her car she has written: 'Justice for my son' in white paint.

Pastor Charles Ewing, who helped raise
 Michael and was his uncle, told MailOnline that the teenager had wanted
 to be a heating and cooling engineer because it would be a 'good job 
with a good wage'.

He said: 'People said to him that because he was so big he should play football in college but he was too timid.

'He
 received Jesus into his life about two weeks ago. It was something that
 his grandmother had been talking to him about for some time. It was with her church. I was so elated - at least he has that now'.

Pastor Ewing said that on the night that Michael was killed he was wearing flip flops, a t-shirt, shorts and a hat.

He said: 'There was no chance he was going to be able to run off'.

Loving: Eric Davis, Michael’s cousin, said he was a 'big gentle soul' who used to come round and play computer games with his son rather than go outside  

Eric Davis, Michael’s cousin, described him as a 'big gentle soul'.He said: 'Michael used to come round my house all the time when he was a boy and play with my son.

'They used to sit there for hours playing computer games like NBA2K. He didn’t want to go outside and play with his friends.

'We used to ask them if they needed anything and they would just say: "Can you get us some food?"

'Michael was meek and quiet but he loved Thanksgiving when about 30 grandkids and eight siblings who would go to his grandmother’s house.'

Michael split his time between his mother’s house and his grandmother’s place in Ferguson,  a working class community of 21,000 people where nearly a quarter of people live below the poverty line.

It is overwhelmingly African-American, but all save three of the 53 police officers in the town's force are white, including the chief.

To become a success from such humble roots would have required an admirable determination on Michael's part - but it seems he was up to the task.

He attended Normandy High School where a former classmate told MailOnline that he was quiet and did not talk much but stayed out of trouble.

He also had a great sense of humour and was always going to make something of his life, friends said.

Hershel Johnson, who knew Michael since middle school, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch: 'We were at graduation, me and him, and we were talking. He said he wasn’t going to end up like some people on the streets. He was going to get an education. He was going to make his life a whole a lot better.'

As a freshman Michael was in Junior ROTC and whilst he was a sophomore he played football.

He switched to McCluer High School in nearby Ferguson-Florissant and then returned to Normandy for his senior year.

There he put in the hours in a credit recovery programme which meant he could graduate in May instead of going to summer school or repeating a year.

Relatives said he did it for his mother out of respect and love for her.

Friend Gerard Fuller told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael was not like his other friends and that he did not want to become a basketball or football player.

The two bonded over their love of rap and Gerard recalled how Michael used to listen to Tupac on his headphones - recently he had tried some rapping of his own under the name 'Big Mike' and his videos posted on Facebook had been a hit among friends.

Michael's graduation day was on May 22 and a picture taken then shows him smiling in his green gown after being given his diploma.

It would have been one of the proudest days of his life, and that of his parents.

Friend Raquan Smith said: 'After that was done and people were leaving, I remember seeing him off to the side. He kind of just came up to me and said: "We made it".

'"Yeah man, we made it", I told him. It was a breath of fresh air to know someone else shared the struggle in school. And now we were starting a whole new life.'

Other family members have described Michael as a 'sharer' and a 'giver' who would give away candy in middle school that he was selling.

While Michael should have been starting at Vatterott College, a local trade school, and his friends are leaving for colleges elsewhere his family are planning his funeral.

Pictures posted on Michael’s Facebook page show he adored his family and a number of photos show him holding a baby girl, thought to be his niece.

Michael’s aunt Elizabeth Spivey has said: 'He wasn't a violent person. He was peaceful. He was a gentle giant. He looked like he could really do something but he wouldn't.'

The most heartbreaking interviews however come from Lesley and Michael Sr.

She has described her son as a 'big teddy bear' and said that Michael was 'the type of person that everybody flocked to'.

Determined: Ms McSpadden, who has written the above phrase on her car, told MailOnline that: 'We are going to make a lot of noise about this. This isn’t going away'

Lesley, 34, told USA Today: 'He wanted to be really good in visual arts and heating and cooling. He was really good with his hands and taking things apart and putting them back together. He was almost like a healer.

'He fixed things. He didn't create problems. He fixed things. My son was sweet. He didn't mean any harm to anybody.'

Michael Sr has broken down in tears and has called for calm, adding that his son would not have wanted violence after his death.

He has said: 'He wouldn’t have wanted none of that. We're going to do it the right way. But we need justice for our son'.
