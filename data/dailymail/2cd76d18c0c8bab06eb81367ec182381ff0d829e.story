An artist has shown there is a lot of truth in the saying 'one man's junk is another man's treasure' by modifying charity shop paintings into masterpieces worth up to $800.

Dave Pollot first came up with the idea of injecting new life into tired works of art when he and girlfriend Becca were joking about putting humorous objects into paintings.

Now the engineer from Rochester, New York, spends his free time bringing new life to tired-looking paintings that he buys from charity shops and car boot sales.

Dave Pollot came up with the idea when he and his girlfriend, Becca, were joking about putting humorous objects into paintings, as they rummaged through the disused works at their local charity shop

He works on his paintings around his day job as an engineer, usually only spending one day on each, and sells them for between $150 and $800

His first sale came when Becca brought home a print and asked him to modify it - he added a monster peaking over one of the existing buildings and was able to sell it at a local art show

He said: 'The response has been truly unbelievable. I just got back from vacation to something like 115 orders to fill.

'A year ago if someone asked me whether I thought art was a viable career path, I would have answered with an emphatic no.

'Now,
 my girlfriend has left her job and is taking over the business side of 
things. Who knows, perhaps next year I won’t have to wait until after 
5pm to open a beer and paint.

'Usually,
 the idea just strikes me in a very spur of the moment way.

He also incorporates recognisable brands such as the Apple logo (pictured) into his work

Mr Pollot said his inspiration was a love of pop culture and recognised brands, both real and fake, often appear in his work such as Duff Beer (left) Homer's drink of choice in The Simpsons and Coca Cola (right)

Star Wars characters and themes feature heavily in his paintings - which sell for up to £500

'The 
inspiration for the subject matter is just a love of pop culture and a 
general desire to make things seem to belong where they do not.'

Mr Pollot has since created more than 50 
modified paintings and prints, to which he has added the likes of 
sharks, the Apple logo, Star Wars characters, references from The 
Simpsons, and popular figures from the TV show Futurama.
