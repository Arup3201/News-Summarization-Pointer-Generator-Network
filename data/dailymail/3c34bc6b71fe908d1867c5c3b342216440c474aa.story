Senior civil servants were encouraged to wear party hats while discussing spending cuts in the run up to Christmas as staff faced losing their jobs.

In a bizarre exercise at a directors meeting, attended by the director of strategy and director of finances for the Department of Education, participants were told they had to keep their party hats on until they had revealed where they would be making cuts to save money.

The game, which was not allowed to be photographed, was posted on a internal government website in a blog by Simon Judge, director of finance and commercial.

Union representatives branded the activity as 'highly insensitive and crass', labeling it as a 'monumental lack of judgment' to discuss future services.

The DfE responded to a letter written by the  Public and Commercial Services Union saying the meeting was about non-sensitive issues - not staff reductions - and criticised the union for its 'inaccurate' and 'unhelpful' description of events.

Mr Judge wrote about the activity in his weekly blog - that is only viewable to civil servants and officials who have access to the government intranet.

In the week commencing December 17 he wrote for Tuesday that he had attended a 'Board and Directors' meeting - a meeting which the DofE said was one of the regular meetings of Directors.

Simon Judge, director of finances, wrote about the game in December. The purpose of the activity was for directors to propose how they intended to remove inefficiencies in systems and processes

He wrote: 'Hilary Spencer (director of strategy) then led some brief workshop activity to review policy delivery plans, and then we did an exercise with party hats that I was not allowed to photograph.

'We all had to stay (sic) what we were stopping, as part of the DfE Review, and we could then take our hat off.'

The DfE said the meeting covered service improvements.

The purpose of the activity was for directors to 'propose how they intended to remove inefficiencies in systems/processes and to reduce bureaucracy in their area', they said in a letter in response to the union.

The 'removal of inefficiencies' included ways to save money.

The PCS said DfE officials were encouraged to wear the hats while discussing the future of services and branded the game 'outrageous'.

The DfE currently employs 480 staff at Mowden Hall, in Darlington, Durham.

The Government is looking to cut about 1,000 jobs nationwide, and Mowden Hall staff could be moved elsewhere in the North-East.

Kathy Prendiville, PCS' education group secretary, said the behaviour of staff was 'highly insensitive and crass', and wrote to Chris Wormald, DfE permanent secretary, expressing the union's upset.

She said: 'This was a serious error of judgement and it is hard to understand how a group of senior civil servants could consider it appropriate.

'The Christmas period is no excuse for such a monumental loss of judgement, as virtually every member of staff in the department faced a Christmas of anxiety and worry for themselves and their families.'

Hundreds of Mowden Hall workers last month staged a protest to keep their jobs in Darlington, and a petition has attracted more than 1,100 signatures.

Darlington MP Jenny Chapman said she was disappointed with the conduct of DfE staff.

She said: 'They shouldn't be making light entertainment out of the situation, they are public sector workers and we expect better from them.'

A spokesman from the DfE said staff had not behaved insensitively.

He said: 'The Department has replied to the PCS and their inaccurate and unhelpful description of events.

'This was a regular meeting of directors and included an item on strategic planning to remove inefficiencies in systems and not staff reductions.

'The approach used was designed to be engaging about a subject that is not sensitive, and had it been so, we would not have used it.

'The management committee is fully aware of the impact of headcount reductions and we are committed to minimising uncertainty through clear and consistent engagement with staff.

'We have always said this would be a difficult and challenging time, but these are necessary steps if we want this country to have the best education and children's services.'
