As police were talking to the suspect, his father, 54-year-old Edward Campbell, allegedly pulled alongside in a red SUV and opened fire on the officers, ABC11 reported.

The father fled in his truck but was captured 90 minutes later in the woods. A search of his truck revealed two dead bodies under a mattress on the flatbed, according to WRAL. 

A spokesman from the Greenbrier County Sheriff's Department told Daily Mail Online on Friday that two officers were shot by the suspects and had been hospitalized but were going to be fine. 

He said that the two quick-thinking cops had relatively new information as to the license plate of the stolen SUV when they apprehended the vehicle.   

Sheriff Brindell Wilkins, of Granville County, North Carolina, said he believed the couple were killed at their home and their bodies loaded into the truck before the suspects fled for more than 200 miles into West Virginia.

Mr and Mrs Faulkner's pastor  told Daily Mail Online today that the couple were 'quiet, solid people' who were faithful in their attendance to the church and well-loved.

Johnny Richard, pastor of the Mountain's Creek Baptist Church in Oxford, said that the Faulkners 'seemed to have no enemies and were good friends to everyone'.

Mr Richard, who knew the couple for ten years, said that they were very good friends to him personally.

Mr Faulkner was a retired fire chief with the Cornwall Volunteer Fire Department and one of his two sons, Jerome Jr, had also joined the fire service in Raleigh. 

He and the couple's other son, Ricky, were at the scene helping investigators.

The pastor said that he was first alerted to the fire at the elderly couple's home on Thursday morning and went down there.

Amid the busy scene, he could only stand and watch as their home burned to the ground. 

Mr Richard said that he only found out the full extent of the tragedy when reports emerged on Thursday night. 

He said that the church congregation planned to come together on Friday night to share their feelings and pray.

'We have seen death before,' he said. 'But this is something so brutal and vicious. We are going to get through this by coming together.'
