A picture may say a thousand words but a picture and a tune together - well, that says at least a thousand more.

That's the premise behind the new British social network, hoping to overtake Instagram in the popularity stakes.

Tunepics , invented by 33-year-old British marketeer Justin Cooke, allows users to feature a song with every image that they share, capturing the emotion behind a moment.

The Tunepics concept is to capture the emotion behind every picture that users share to add emotion to the picture sharing experience

The British social network is growing at a rate of 100,000 new sign-ups a week and so far celebrity users include Jamie Oliver, Kate Bosworth, Adele, will.i.am, The Libertines, Natalie Imbruglia and Richard Branson.

There are also accounts for Cara Delevingne with over 23,000 followers and Rihanna with almost 22,000 followers - although Tunepics couldn't officially confirm they're the real deal. 

At Tunepic Towers, they take celebrity verification very seriously and request passport information before placing a little note symbol next to the username (which means an account is verified as legit).

Fashion brands like Asos, Hunter, Paul Smith and Chloe are also getting in on the act. 

In a perfect example of how music can bring a picture to life, this weekend Jamie Oliver posted an inspiring image of Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel peace prize winner, with a stirring backing track of Ennio Morricone's The Mission.

His previous post of an open fire pizza oven was amusingly accompanied by Burn Baby Burn by Ash.

The 100,000 new users a week include Kate Bosworth (left), who posted this selfie along with Lana Del Rey's version of the American national anthem, and Jamie Oliver (right), who uploaded a picture of himself with rapper Example, along with one of the rapper's tracks

Kate Bosworth's weekend postings included an image of a lion chilling on its back along with Bob Marley's Turn Your Lights Down Low.

Rather than the slew of selfies and 'I'm having more fun than you' snaps that dominate other social networks, Tunepics allows people to share a moment and a feeling.

To add to the emotional Tunepics experience, when followers respond to posts, they don't just 'like' an image but use an 'emotion wheel' to show if they're 'inspired', 'happy' or 'dancing' to the post. 

Founder and CEO Justin  says it was his own picture-music-mash-up moment that inspired the idea.

'I was walking along the King’s Road in London, I took a photograph of some autumn leaves and then I went in my iTunes library and played Paolo Nutini’s Autumn. It was the most incredible feeling, I had goosebumps and I couldn’t stop looking at the photo,' he tells MailOnline. 

'That was  about three years ago and I remember thinking, "Wow, imagine if you could just capture a feeling in a moment". It just felt like the most natural thing in the world,' says 33-year-old Justin.

He was convinced that someone would come up with the idea - but they didn't, so he decided to create it himself.

Who has the audacity to compete with giants like Facebook and Instagram for a slice of the social media action? Someone who was made vice president of Burberry aged 25 and then went onto head up Topshop marketing, perhaps.

When Angela Ahrendts wanted to make Burberry young and fashionable again, Justin was her right hand tech man.

He was part of the team that created fashion firsts such as live-stream catwalk shows and click-and-buy catwalk technology.

Soon Sir Philip Green came knocking and poached him to head up marketing for Topshop. 

Inspired by his mentor Sir Philip, Justin decided to set up alone and turn his Tunepics idea into reality.

To help get the idea off the ground he set up a marketing agency, innovate7, for a little extra cash flow, which now has Chelsea Football Club, Nike, Coca-Cola as clients, .

'I love the idea that we can redefine the way people share and discover moments of their lives. When you hear a song and you look at a picture you can remember how things smell it awakens all your senses. Its like redefining the photo album and the mixtape all in one,' he says.

'Social media allows you to travel through time in a way, as it takes you back to memories and moments – or even looking forward to something.

'Tunepics is a place where you can capture the magic of your life and share the emotion behind that moment.

'Music is probably the most powerful way to bring all of those feelings to the surface, but there are many layers of Tunepics – whether that’s touching the emotion wheel, or the memories that a tunepic triggers,' he adds.

So does he think his all singing all dancing version of Instagram could overtake its big brother?

'There are incredible social platforms out there, and I would never want to say that we’re better or that we’re doing something that they can’t do, there’s space for everyone. 

'I think it would be arrogant for us to assume that we’re going to be as big as them – but it’s something that we absolutely dream of. I think every great idea has to start with a big ambition and a big dream. 

'We think we are building a social network for tomorrows generation – it’s the future and it will take time but people seem to love it. Have you ever met anyone in your life who doesn’t like music? That’s a pretty great start point. 

'I don’t think there’s a single moment in my life where music isn’t relevant, and this is really about allowing people to capture that. 

'It’s fun, it’s simple and intuitive,' he adds.

Tunepics users can search from over 35 million songs to feature with their images by using keywords and they can also add an array of filters to boost photos.

An innovative weather filter helps heighten the mood of a moment by adding sunshine, rain, snow, raindrops or a rainbow to a snap.

With over 500 million pictures uploaded to the Internet every day and over 100 million songs downloaded every week, Tunepics could be the perfect marrying of our two biggest online obsessions.
