Europe captain Paul McGinley may regret leaving Ian Poulter out of Saturday afternoon's Ryder Cup foursome pairings after the Englishman engineered a stunning fightback  in the morning session.

Poulter lost his Ryder Cup opener with Stephen Gallacher to Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed on day one, but the heroics he's become renowned for in this tournament were back on show in the morning as he and Rory McIlroy came from behind to halve their match with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker.

McIlroy will be back in action however for Europe with his partner from Friday, Sergio Garcia, as they take on Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan in the foursomes.

The Northern Irish world No 1 tees off with his Spanish team-mate at 1.30pm.

Furyk and Mahan come into the match on the back of a 4&3 win on Saturday morning Jamie Donaldson and Lee Westwood, who will have a chance at redemption against Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar in the 1.15pm start.

It was no surprise to see US captain Tom Watson keep young guns Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed together after the duo with a combined age of 45 - the youngest in Ryder Cup history - followed their Friday win with a 5&3 victory against Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer.

They will play Europe's Kaymer and Justin Rose, who beat Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar in the morning with Henrik Stenson. Stenson is sitting out the afternoon session due to a minor back complaint.

Victor Dubuisson and Graeme McDowell are back in action on Saturday afternoon against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler - who have halved all three of their matches so far.

Dubuisson and McDowell take form into the afternoon after their upset win on day one over the duo of Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, who were previously unbeaten in the Ryder Cup.
