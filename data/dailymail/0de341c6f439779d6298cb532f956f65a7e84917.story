The Reign of Cats and Dogs has arrived, as both Saturday and Sunday saw a huge success for our four-legged friends

The Reign of Cats and Dogs has arrived, as both Saturday and Sunday saw a huge success for our four-legged friends at an event that aimed to adopt out dogs and parade famous cats.  

The two day event took place at  Bicentennial Park on Glebe Foreshore, in the inner west  Sydney, New South Wales, where dogs from RSPCA and 12 other animal shelters were matched with their perfect owner on Saturday and rulers of the cat world strutted their stuff on Sunday.

On Saturday 1,500 people travelled to Bicentennial Park for the Rescue Me canine event that began at 10am till 2pm. 

A spokeswoman for RSPCA told Daily Mail Australia said it was a huge success that saw a lot of foot traffic. 

'There was a Yum Cha stand, a New York pastrami deli, Mr Whippy and a coffee truck... everyone was really happy.'

'It was a great day - in total 50 dogs were adopted - we had 10 dogs from the RSPCA that were adopted,' she said. 

The spokeswoman said a lot of the dogs were cross-breed but some breeds did particularly well with the crowds. 

'The grey hounds did really well-  five of them were adopted,' she said. 'Cattle dogs also did well - adopting out four of them.' 

As for the rest of the dogs that were left behind, they will be going back to their rescue shelters waiting for someone to take them home. 

Cats have also been celebrated by New South Wales RSPCA, with the International Cat Film Furstival in that park on Sunday night at 6pm. 

This feline event, stemmed from the globally-toured Internet Cat Video Festival, showcased the rulers of the cat world on big screen, as cat lovers gathered  to watch famous internet cats strut their stuff.

'Cats are the second most searched topic on the internet and millions of cat internet videos are shared around the world every day — think Colonel Meow, Grumpy Cat and many, many more,' said the RSPCA. 

The festival was 'cat-tastic' selling around 1,900 tickets. 

'There were lots of stuff for the family - a  Cattoo Parlour with temporary tattoos, a RSPCA merchandise tent and activities to make cat toys,' the spokeswoman said.

'There was also a live Twitter feed on the big screen.'  

'The VIP section was amazing - it had huge bean bags that were the length of your body'.  

'It was a great success,' RSPCA's spokeswoman said.
