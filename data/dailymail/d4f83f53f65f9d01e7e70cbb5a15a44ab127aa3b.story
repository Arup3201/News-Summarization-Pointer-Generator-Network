Trailers for a new TV special have offered some insight into how J Crew store layouts invite theÂ  customer to spend more money.

The retailer's larger-than-life CEO, Millard 'Mickey' Drexler explains how the arrangement of products and mannequins can maximise sales, and make the most of every item's potential.In the show, which airs next Thursday, he explains to CNBC's David Faber that mannequin placement is key, as clever positioning can help guide customers in a particular direction.

Visual heaven: J Crew reveals how the brand's store layouts invite the  customer to spend more money - from where the shoes are displayed to the placement of mannequins - every detail makes a difference

He reveals that nail polish and jewellery is displayed with the clothing, rather than in a separate section of the store, in a bid to highlight the range of product on offer.For the same reason, a pair of shoes or selection of belts might be placed near a contrasting dress or shirt, helping the customer imagine how they might put a look together.Arranging products in a variety of ways, with some folded, others hanging, encourages a buyer to explore the offering more, because everything is within easy reach, he continues.

'I see it and I feel it,' Mr Drexler, 67, tells , lifting one folded item. 'This is a beautiful cashmere cable sweater.

'When something is out of reach, it presents a problem.'

Proving that even his team are fallible, an example presents itself when he comes across a display of brown belts in a narrow-necked jar.

'This is not an easy shopping thing,' he admits. 'I hope these belts are someplace else.'

Mr Drexler used the example of this season's must-have polka dot print to show how essential layout is to sales.

Explaining that the print would look overwhelming of the shirt and the dress were to be displayed side-by-side, he said: 'The last thing you want is polka dots hanging together.'

A sales assistant confirmed the effectiveness of the concept: 'The polka dot long-sleeve shirt, that people are loving, have been flying out the door,' she said.

Mr Drexler, 67, who, in the past, has revolutionised brands including Gap and Ann Taylor, is hailed the 'king of retail' in the CNBC special.

It describes how he transformed the once-failing brand into a retail success story that makes $2billion in sales each year.

When asked about the secret to his success, he said: 'I think it's a combination of your gut and experience and wisdom and being as curious as you can be. The gut is important, you see it, you feel it...'

That he is involved in every single detail of every single product certainly makes a difference.

CNBC follows Mr Drexler to a fabric mill in Italy, where the cotton for J Crew shirts is made, and his forensic attention to detail when going through a collection with his team.

Firing off question after question in collection run-throughs, he grills his staff on the product, how it is placed stores and why.

He asks his team: 'Is this easy for a woman to wear?'

Then: 'Why do we need three shawl cardigans? We don't.

Which was quickly followed by: 'Button or no button? Raise your hands!'

Staff precision: J Crew employees work throughout the night on displays that then get copied across the U.S.

Anna Wintour believes there are many talented CEO's, but most of them are 'removed'.

She explained: 'There is nothing removed about Mikey Drexler. You can walk the floor with [him] and he knows every single piece of clothing on the floor.'

Jenna Lyons, J Crew's famously quirky executive creative director, says Mr Drexler just wants to make sure customers are asking the right questions.

She said: 'It's about pausing to say wait a minute, did I miss a diamond in the rough, did I miss a jewel? He calls it panning for gold.'

Both Ms Lyon's and Mr Drexler's vision is summed up by Ms Wintour: 'You know, I think the customer needs something fun, creative. And they don't have to take a mortgage out on expensive things.'
