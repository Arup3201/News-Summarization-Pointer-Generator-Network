This is the moment that an unexploded World War II bomb was detonated after a father-of-two dug it up  in the back garden of his home.

Marcus Fairs, 47, found the World War Two three inch mortar while planting a bamboo screen at the rear of his £1.25 million property in Stoke Newington, north London.

His wife Rupinder Bhogal, 44, and their two children Jordi,10, and Millie, eight, were also at home when he made the discovery of the device, which weighed the same as a bag of sugar.

The moment that the bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion on the World War II bomb that was found  by gardener Marcus Fairs, 47

The family and their neighbours were told to move to the front rooms of their houses while the Bomb Squad removed the device before carrying out a controlled explosion in nearby Clissold Park, Hackney.

 'I was just digging away putting in some black bamboo to screen the back fence,' said Mr Fairs, editor of online architecture magazine Dezeen.

'I had dug up a lot of bricks already, because, ironically, there had been an air raid shelter at the back of the garden. I was really going for it with the shovel and hit something that was metal and then I hit it again.

The discovery was made by Marcus Fairs as he dug up his garden to make way for a new bamboo screen

'It was about eight inches down and I removed the dirt around it.

'When I first saw it, I just thought it was a bomb and I was really excited. It was about a foot long.

'I was a bit nonchalant about it and I picked it up and took a picture of it a posted it on twitter asking what to do.

'Someone then told me to call the police. But before I did that I made sure I finished the work in the garden because I didn't know if we were going to be evacuated.

'I called 101 and they were really helpful and said someone would be on the way. Within five minutes there were three squad cars here.

'We were told to move to the front of the house and so were all the neighbours. My family were a bit nervous about it because they didn't know what was going to happen.

Mr Fairs sent a message to his Twitter followers asking what he should do after digging up the unexploded bomb

'All the neighbours knew about it and there was a mixture of excitement and concern over my foolhardiness.

'When the police were examining it in the garden it was a light-hearted atmosphere, but when the Bomb Squad guys turned up things went a bit hush hush.

'I felt a bit left out to be honest, but I thought the whole thing was very exciting.

'Then all of a sudden the guy who was dealing with it got up and brought it through the house with tape around the end and they told us they were going to conduct a controlled explosion in the park.

The Bomb Squad examined the device in the garden of the £1.25million home before taking it to a nearby park and carrying out a controlled explosion

'I wasn't worried about it being carried through the house because if it was going to go it would have been when I hit it with the shovel, so I wasn't too concerned.

'I was a bit disappointed when they took it away, because I thought it was my bomb and my discovery.

'It was only when they took it to the park when I realised it was really live and it was a real bomb. I saw the video of the explosion and it was huge.

'The whole experience was really exciting and I wasn't really worried or terrified about it. I thought it was interesting.'

Experts believe the device was a three inch British mortar that had been kept by a serviceman as a souvenir

However, the drama has not put him off his gardening hobby and he plans to be turning the soil again this weekend.

He said: 'Gardening is a hobby and a bit of the necessity at the moment. The garden needs a bit of work and there is a lot more to do.

'I'm going to be out here again next weekend working at it all again.

'I have been gardening for years and have found lots of stuff at in other gardens, like bottles and horseshoes, but I have never found a bomb and this has to be the highlight of my gardening career.'

Mr Fairs said 'It was only when they took it to the park when I realised it was really live and it was a real bomb. I saw the video of the explosion and it was huge'

Mr Fairs said he found the whole experience 'really exciting' and was not terrified or worried

The bomb was taken to Clissold Park, Hackney, which was evacuated by police where it was destroyed in a controlled explosion

Mr Fairs said: 'I saw the video and was amazed at how powerful it was.

'They even put insulation around it to lessen the effect of the explosion, but it was still huge.

'Since it happened I have been told by a friend it looked like a British mortar, which may have been brought back by a serviceman after the war and kept in the air raid shelter as a memento.'
