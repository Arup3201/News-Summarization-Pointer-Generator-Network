Andrew Flintoff's surprise return to county cricket will do wonders for the domestic game, according to England spinner James Tredwell.

Five years after retiring from the sport, Flintoff announced he will play Twenty20 matches for Lancashire Lightning in the Natwest T20 Blast this season.

The 36-year-old has been training with his former club for months and signed a new deal on Friday morning.

'It's huge for the domestic game,' said Tredwell who is preparing for England's fourth Royal London one-day international against Sri Lanka on Saturday.

'(England bowler) Jimmy Anderson is obviously quite close to the whole thing so it's been an ongoing story in the dressing room.

'Having greats like him involved in the game is great for everyone.

'As a young player in that Lancashire dressing room having him to sit next to and chat through different scenarios and watch how he goes about it in different environments in games - it's going to be beneficial.

'And for the people who play against him it'll be great too.'

Flintoff
 plans to play a second XI match next week and the Ashes 2005 hero's 
first competitive comeback could come against Yorkshire Vikings next 
Friday.

Tredwell admits he enjoyed watching Flintoff during his career more than playing against him.

'The only memory I have is bowling at Canterbury and I think he hit me for 24 in an over - a couple came bouncing off the indoor school,' he said.

'It was always a pleasure to watch him play, to see how he went about his business - he was always wholehearted and I'm sure that will continue in the next period for him.'
