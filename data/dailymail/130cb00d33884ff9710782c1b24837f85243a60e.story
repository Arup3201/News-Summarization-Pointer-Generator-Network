Â If you have ever been embarrassed by an unflattering or too revealing picture posted online, Snapchat, a new iPhone app, could be the answer to your prayers. Enter: the self-destructing photograph.

Snapchat was born after two undergraduates at the American university, Stanford, noticed their friends frantically deleting incriminating or unsuitable photos from their Facebook accounts just before going on a job interview or on a date.

Their app allows users to take a photo and send it to friends, but the recipient can only look at the photo for a few seconds before it self-destructs - leaving no digital trace.

He needs Snapchat! U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner sent lewd pictures of himself to a 21-year-old student via Twitter. Unfortunately, he also managed to tweet them to everyone else too.

The app could also come to the rescue of the many celebs caught out by the sexting trend, which has seen the likes of Rihanna and Democratic Congressman, Anthony Weiner, reveal much more than expected to the public.

Other celebrities who probably wish they had Snapchat include Twilight actress Ashley Greene, whose topless photos were splashed across the internet when her email inbox was hacked, Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively and Vanessa Hudgens.

Even Prince Harry was left red-faced, after a fellow party-goer snapped him in the nude during a game of strip billiards earlier this year.

But if you're hoping Snapchat is the answer to all of your pictorial woes, be warned: there's a glitch.

Unscientific testing conducted by the Daily Mail revealed that fast-fingered iPhone users can save a screen grab of the image before it self-destructs, so long as they're within the time limit set by the sender.

Perhaps it might be better to think twice before sending that risque text after all....
