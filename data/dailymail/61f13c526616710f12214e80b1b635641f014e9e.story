A gang which hijacked mobile phone accounts to swindle £2.8million from Vodafone customers by making £2.50-a-minute calls to a premium call number are now facing jail.

The four men assigned the phone numbers of Vodafone customers to a SIM card in their possession by calling up and posing as the account holder.

They then used the SIM cards to repeatedly call premium rate lines they had purchased, which typically had connection charges of around £2.50 per call.

Vodafone would pay those premium rate lines for the calls before billing the genuine customer, whose only knowledge of the fraud would be that their own phone had ceased to operate.

Some bills received by genuine customers were in excess of £80,000.

Three of the gang were tried at Blackfriars Crown Court following a four-year investigation by South Yorkshire Police and were convicted of conspiracy to defraud yesterday.

Nadeem Ali, 26, (left) travelled abroad and used SIM cards to call international numbers.  Waseem Rashid, 26,  (right) , gave his own details when obtaining a SIM card from a mobile phone shop and provided the details of another person to obtain a SIM which was later linked to 47 hijacks

Traditionally thieves have made money by simply selling stolen phones 
on to someone else, but increasingly organised gangs rent premium rate telephone numbers.

They then use stolen phones or move across legitimate phone numbers to their SIM cards to call those premium numbers 
repeatedly.

In this case the four men pretended to be Vodafone customers when they called up the mobile phone network and requested the phone numbers of genuine Vodafone customers be assigned to SIM cards they had. 

It is not clear how they managed to pass the security checks.

Waseem Rashid, 26, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, gave his own details when obtaining a SIM card from a mobile phone shop and provided the details of another person to obtain a SIM which was later linked to 47 hijacks.

Imran Rasab, 35, of Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was behind a company which purchased thousands of mobile phone customer details from marketing companies.

He was found in possession of SIM 'gateway' equipment with multiple card slots, used to dial several phone numbers at the same time.

Nadeem Ali, 26, of Rotherham, travelled abroad to France and the Netherlands.

During the trips, SIM cards were used to call international numbers and these SIM cards were linked to hijacked customers of Vodafone.

Kaleem Hussain, 30, of Rotherham, had previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud. 

All four defendants will be sentenced on April 11.

Detective Constable Mark Wootton of South Yorkshire Police, said: 'The conspiracy was organised and highly effective and as a result some victims received bills in excess of £80,000, which must have come as a shock.

'Vodafone rightly and properly helped pursue these criminals.'

Mark Hughes, Vodafone's head of security, said: 'We take any fraud against our customers very seriously and had no hesitation in vigorously pursuing these individuals to get justice for the victims and to prevent others from being defrauded.'
