When Grenadier Guard Ronald Skinner returned home from the Second World War battlefield he never told his family about the horrors he witnessed.

The veteran, who signed up for the army in 1934, saw action in North Africa as British troops pushed up to take Italy.

The former serviceman died in 1974 aged 56 and his son Steve, then 32, thought he would never know what his father experienced on the frontline.

War memories: Steve Skinner, 71, with a suitcase full of his father's belongings. He inherited the case in 2005 but did not look inside until recently

But Mr Skinner, now 71, has now found his father's wartime diaries buried in an old box of belongings he had stashed in the attic.

Ronald left all his belongings with his widow Gladys when he died. His son inherited the suitcase when she died in 2005 at the age of 84.

Steve put it in his loft without looking 
inside but opened it recently and was astonished to find the diaries and
 see that his father had written poems.

He discovered that although his father escaped the conflict uninjured he did badly cut his
 hand when chopping up an apple and had to have stitches without 
anaesthetic.

Mr Skinner Snr fought in many hill battles and the Battle of Monte Cassino in Rome in 1944.

Among his diary entries he wrote: 'What a night. Heavy shelling and gunfire.

'Our guns answered. Like hell. You can't sleep at night here. Wet and snow - a few killed and several wounded.

'I swear now no son or sons of mine will ever go to war under any circumstances whatsoever.'

Another diary entry said: 'Fair day, terrible night. Shelling far too close - lucky to escape.'

Steve also found a poignant poem by his father who had enlisted at the age of 17 in 1934, entitled 'Why do the weak men have to fight'.

Steve, a retired blind fitter from Sudbury, Suffolk, said: 'The people who go to war are not the people who make war. My father was not "gung ho".

Among his diary entries Mr Skinner wrote: 'What a night. Heavy shelling and gunfire.

'Our guns answered. Like hell. You can't sleep at night here. Wet and snow - a few killed and several wounded.

'I swear now no son or sons of mine will ever go to war under any circumstances whatsoever.'

Another diary entry said: 'Fair day, terrible night. Shelling far too close - lucky to escape.'

'He tried to normalise his experience by writing. It was a way of hanging on to his sanity.

'They did not know when they were going to die. When they went to sleep they would think it could be their last before the big sleep.

'I used to listen to tales about what happened in the war and they just seemed like stories to us.

'Reading what dad wrote gives us an insight into what he went through and it makes me very proud.

'He admitted to me that he was scared and extremely lucky. He suffered from shell shock, but he never made a fuss of it.'

Mr Skinner signed up with the Grenadier Guards in 1934 and served at Windsor Castle before being called to war.

He married his wife Gladys in 1939 and Steve, their first child, was born in 1942 but was not properly seen by his father until he return from war in 1945.

Steve, who lives with his wife Ruth, 67, added: 'The poems dad wrote expressed what life was like in the trenches being bombarded with enemy fire.

Wartime note: A letter written by Mr Skinner to his wife. He signs off saying he hopes all is well back home 'love from your devoted husband'

'To people who have seen this portrayed in films, it doesn't seem real.

'But when it's your father's first-hand accounts in his own handwriting - and some of it quite shaky - it brings home the reality of it all.

'It's an important part of our family history but it's also a first hand account of the circumstances soldiers found themselves in.

'It's a significant part of the country's history too.'

Steve now hopes to publish his father's poetry in a book to raise money for Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.

Dispatch: The untitled poem written by Mr Skinner on the frontline which begins 'how sleeps the beast in the soul of man'. It is reproduced in full below

Military: Mr Skinner, who signed up for the army in 1934, died in 1974 aged 56

How sleeps the beast in the soul of man,

The urge to do what's wrong,

It is easy to fight it, some men can,

But others are not so strong.

So when the final reckonings come,

Remember he who tried,

And share the laurels one by one,

Do not their souls divide.

Why do the weak men have to fight,

The strong man not to worry,

Why the fit man take his time,

The lame man have to hurry?

â€˜Tis the way of life that's given

So we just must not grumble,

And if we want to go to heaven,

Give a right good smile at a tumble.
