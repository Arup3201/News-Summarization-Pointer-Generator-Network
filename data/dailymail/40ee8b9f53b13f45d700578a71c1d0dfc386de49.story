Sabine Lisicki has progressed to the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the fifth year in a row after a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Yaroslava Shvedova that was mired in controversy.

The German, a beaten finalist last year, clearly angered her Kazakh opponent in the deciding set by walking off court having double-faulted to gift break point in the third game.

Lisicki demanded a trainer for a sore right shoulder but Shvedova was initially reluctant to return to her chair at such a key moment in the match.

Victory: Sabine Lisicki was delighted to come through unscaved against Yaroslava Shvedova

Controversial: The German took a physio break at a crucial time in the match

After a 
five-minute medical time-out, during which Lisicki received massages and
 stretches, the players returned and the 19th seed won the next three 
points to save her service game.

She
 broke in the next and although Shvedova broke back Lisicki eventually 
clinched the match with a deep return before crumpling to her knees in 
delight.Â 

All match her serve had proved her Achilles heel. Her ball toss was erratic and she gave up an astonishing 20 double faults.

But
 she progresses to face Simona Halep on Wednesday hoping to continue her
 bid to go one better than last year, when she was beaten by Marion 
Bartoli in the final.

Respect: Despite her outrage, Shvedova congratulated her opponent after the match

Lisicki denied her choice of medical time-out had been tactical. 'The timing was very unfortunate,' she said.

'I hit a ball before, and it just went into my back. I tried to keep going. I played a few points but I wasn't able to lift my arm.

'It was obvious. I was serving 50 miles an hour or something. I don't remember if I ever served that slow in my life before. That's why I had to call the trainer.'

To accusations of gamesmanship, she responded: 'I cannot change their opinion. I just know honest to myself that that hasn't been the case because I really tried to play several more points.

'I have a big respect for my opponent. It's the first time that I had to do it ever. That's the only thing I can say.'

On a mission: Lisicki is looking to reach the Wimbledon final for the second year running
