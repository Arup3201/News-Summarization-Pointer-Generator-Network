A former male model and a restaurant bus boy are both missing after a building exploded in New York City on Thursday afternoon.

Nicholas Figueroa, a 23-year-old former Hollister model who lives in Harlem, was on a second date at Sushi Park on Second Avenue with a girl he met at work.

A bus boy at the restaurant, Moises Lucon from Queens, has also been reported missing, a law enforcement official told the Wall Street Journal. 

Police said they also are trying to determine whether six other people reported missing - but not thought to have been in the destroyed buildings - were connected to the explosion.

Missing: Nicholas Figueroa, 23, was on a date with a Bowlmor Lanes co-worker when the restaurant exploded

Search: His family said payment records show he was there but they cannot trace him

Figueroa was at the restaurant with a girl he knew from his job at Bowlmor Lanes on Manhattan's Chelsea Piers.

After the explosion at 3.17pm, she was rushed to Bellevue Hospital with a broken nose, the New York Daily News reported, but Figueroa has not been located.  

Firefighters have yet to pick through the rubble of the three buildings that collapsed. On Friday, they used high-powered water towers to extinguish pockets of fire still burning at the site.

Pommes Frites, the restaurant that collapsed next to explosion site, said on Facebook that all its staff are safe.

Figueroa, who lives in Harlem, was reported missing when he failed to show up for work at 5pm on Thursday and payment records show he paid for the meal at Sushi Park minutes before the blast.

Tyler Figueroa said his brother and his date were paying for the meal when the blast occurred. The date, who is in the hospital, remembers only stumbling outside before losing consciousness, Tyler Figueroa said.

His family told the Daily News they have searched every hospital in Manhattan and do not know where to look next.

'Right now we don't really know what to do, we're just praying,' his family told the paper. 

His brother, Neal Figueroa, told WABC he was confident in his brother, whom he called 'Superman', would be found alive and well.

'I know he's strong enough to get out of this,' he said. 

The 23-year-old's Facebook page shows he modeled for the clothing company in 2013. 

He graduated from Buffalo State College in December with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and a minor in intelligence analysis, spokesman Jerod Dahlgren said.

He has been working at Bowlmor Chelsea Piers for the past few months as a front desk attendant and laser tag attendant, according to spokeswoman Leslie Norden, who said employees were deeply concerned for their hardworking colleague.

Intense flames consumed buildings on Second Avenue and 7th Street following the explosion at 3.15pm - about an hour after Con Edison inspectors visited the building and found the gas-related work being done there 'unacceptable,' according to officials.

'Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

He said the incident 'appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue' and the the investigation is ongoing.

After the explosion, the site of the blast and two neighboring buildings caught alight, eventually causing all three to crumble to the ground - leaving a massive hole on the end of the block.

Nineteen people were injured, four of them critically. Five first responders, among them four firefighters and an EMS worker, also suffered minor injuries.

Two of the critical patients have been taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Cornell suffering from burns to their airways.
