This photograph shows the unique bond between a mother and her newborn son.

But just two days after it was taken, moments after Lisa Parkisson gave birth to tiny Zac, the 35-year-old died suddenly in hospital.

The new mother, who would have celebrated her 36th birthday today, was elated in the hours after her first child's birth.

But just hours later, her family received a call from staff at the Royal Oldham Hospital, changing their lives forever - she had died on the post-natal ward.

Just one day after this touching photograph was taken moments after Lisa Parkisson gave birth to her son Zac, the 35-year-old died suddenly on the post-natal ward at the Royal Oldham Hospital

Today Ms Parkisson's family are demanding answers over her death, as Zac's father Chris Harding along with her parents and sister plan his future without his mother.

Ms Parkisson's sister Ally Ziemniak, 40, said: 'They said a midwife had gone into check at 8.30am and noticed something wasn't right and they tried to resuscitate her but couldn't.

'She was in bed, there was blood everywhere, it was so terrible.'

Ms Parkisson went into labour on Friday evening and was admitted to hospital on Saturday, where staff found her baby was breech.

It meant her planned water birth gave way to a caesarean operation and Zac was born at about 2.30am on Saturday.

On Sunday, Zac was taken away to be observed in the neo-natal unit while Ms Parkisson rested after her operation.

The
 family returned home to Derker, Oldham, and expected to be joined by 
the 35-year-old holiday cruise operator, in the coming days.

But her father Mr Parkisson received a call on Monday morning to say there had been a medical emergency.

Ms
 Ziemniak, a mother-of-five, added: 'When we got there we expected to be
 told she’d had to go into surgery but she was already dead.'

Ms Parkisson, a cruise manager, went into labour on Friday night and had planned to have a water birth. But staff at the hospital discovered her unborn son was in the breach position, meaning he would have to be delivered by caesarean section

After the 
caesarean, Ms Parkisson had told her mother of an ‘excruciating 
headache’ in surgery - and her family hyave today questioned whether it was linked to her death.

Ms Ziemniak, a mother-of-five, added: 'She went into labour on Friday night and it was supposed to be a normal birth but when we got there the hospital found he was in the breech position so she had to have a caesarean.

'She had the caesarean by epidural so she was awake while she had it done. While she was having the caesarean she developed a headache which she complained about.

'I am numb about what's happened. We will always talk about her to Zac, he will know everything about his mum'

- Lisa Parkisson's partner Chris Harding

'They said it was tied with her blood pressure and gave her an injection to decrease it. The headache eventually went. We don't know if it was anything to do with her death because we haven't had the results.

'She was so over the moon with the baby. She had to stay in hospital because shed had the caesarean. She was okay on the Saturday and Sunday. I spoke to her late Sunday evening and she was fine.

'The baby had gone to have observations so she was going to get some sleep while he was in the neonatal bit, then on Monday morning my dad got a phone call saying there had been an emergency and we all went to the hospital.

'All the way to the hospital I thought it was going to be that she had to go back to theatre or something but she was already dead.

'I never ever want to experience anything like the extent of that shock again. It was the worst thing ever.

'The staff said Lisa was checked through the night and she was asleep and apparently the midwife went round at 8am on Monday and she realised that she didn't look right and they thought they could feel a faint pulse and started resuscitation.

Chris Harding (pictured with Ms Parkisson), paid tribute to his partner and the mother of his son, 'I loved Lisa so much and she loved me. I am numb about what¿s happened'

'They called in the crash team who were there within three minutes and they tried to revive her but couldn't.

'We just don't understand it. When she went into labour she was fine. Even going to the caesarean she seemed well. But she said she had never experienced anything like the headache she had.

'She said she felt like her head was going to explode. All she said on the Sunday was she was fine but her belly was a bit tender.

'I do take some comfort after watching her go through the pregnancy and build up that she was going to be a mum - even though it was for such a short time. I do take some comfort in saying she died extremely happy. As sad as it is, she died experiencing that and that does give us some comfort.

'When she was about to go into labour she was about to celebrate her 36th birthday. She said it was the best early birthday present she could ever have.'

Ms Parkisson's mother 
Judith Smith, 59, a retired teaching assistant from Derker, near Oldham,
 said: 'I've been lying in bed and its going round in my head all the 
time seeing Lisa in the hospital after she died.

'She only held Zac for one day, it's so tragic. She was the most beautiful girl'

- Ms Parkisson's mother Judith Smith

'The memory I can't get out is when I saw her lying in the bed I just looked at her and thought and just prayed she was asleep.

'I can't get her face out of my head. I keep praying and thinking that she didn't suffer.

'The
 last memory I'm going to have of Lisa is so precious - when they 
wheeled her back from the delivery room after the birth, they wheeled 
her round and she presented at the door and her back was towards me.

'But she turned around with Zac and she had this beaming, absolutely beaming smile on her face of utter happiness.

'I had never seen her so happy in all my life and she said, "mum, look, he's gorgeous". She was absolutely over the moon.

'She only held Zac for one day, it's so tragic. She was the most beautiful girl.

'She
 was the most beautiful, caring, funny, gorgeous girl you could ever 
wish for. I'm so glad she got that chance to hold him and look at him.

'I
 thinking about how to get through today the next day and the day after 
that. I'm just going to keep thinking "Lisa, you have left me the most 
precious gift ever".

The Royal Oldham Hospital has launched an internal investigation into the death of Ms Parkisson, pictured left and right. A spokeswoman said staff were unable to resuscitate her, and the cause of death is unknown

'That
 little boy is her. When I hold Zac in my arms I will be holding Lisa at
 the same time. She will never be away. When I hold him she will be 
there. He's beautiful like her.

'Whatever
 happens we are such a strong, big family and again, this is my comfort -
 that little boy will never ever want for anything.

'He
 will be loved by so many people. He will be loved and cherished and 
will want for nothing. He is such a beautiful baby. I just wish I could 
have them both here.'

Ms Smith, added: 'We want answers about what happened.

'She was a beautiful light, so funny, so warm, so kind and loved. And now that light has gone out.'

Baby Zac is still in hospital while his father and family plan his future without his mother

Cathy
 Trinick, head of midwifery at The Pennine Acute Hospitals’ NHS Trust, 
which runs the hospital, said they were unable to resuscitate Ms Parkisson.

She added: 'This is a really tragic event and our thoughts and condolences go out to the family at this difficult time.'

She said the cause of death was not known, the coroner had been informed and staff were carrying out their own internal clinical investigation.

Ms Parkisson’s partner Mr Harding, 35, said: 'I loved Lisa so much and she loved me. I am numb about what’s happened.

'We will always talk about her to Zac, he will know everything about his mum.

'I lie in bed now with her dressing gown, trying to feel close to Lisa. I just wish she was still here.'

Ms Ziemniak, said: 'Lisa always said she wouldn’t have a baby, she loved her job, loved travel and loved to party.

'So when she got pregnant we were all so surprised. But she couldn’t wait, she’d made so many plans and when she’d had him she was just perfectly happy.

'Zac is the only bit of Lisa we have left and he will be so loved.'

Her mother Ms Smith, said: 'We’ve had more than 400 people call and send cards, there’s been an outpouring - she was so, so loved by so many people.

'We will tell Zac all about Lisa, how loving and warm she was.

'We are a strong family and we are all supporting each other. When one of us breaks down we are all there for each other and it will always be like that.'

Mr Parkisson, added: 'We’ll tell Zac how she did everything at 100 miles an hour, how bonnie she was, how much she made everyone laugh.'
