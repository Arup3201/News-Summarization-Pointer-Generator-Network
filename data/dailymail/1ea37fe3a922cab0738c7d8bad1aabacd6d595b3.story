Housing inspectors found six hundred asylum seekers crammed into one 98-bedroom London hotel, it emerged today.

One room at the Queen's Hotel in Crystal Palace had nine people living in it and there were at least four new arrivals to Britain bedding down in most of the building's other rooms.

The local MP has slammed the Home Office after the huge influx of newcomers caused anger in the south London suburb.

Council inspectors found 600 asylum seekers living in the Queen's Hotel in Crystal Palace, south London

It found up to nine people were crammed in each of the building's rooms, with some areas well over capacity

Local council inspectors visited the hotel, which is spread over a number of buildings, earlier this month.

They were shocked by the sheer number of immigrants who have been housed at the site since it opened its doors to newcomers, who are put up at taxpayers' expense.

One building - which is supposed to have a maximum capacity of 68 people - had around 100 people living there, which another building sleeping up to 500.

Many were sharing a room with up to eight others in the crammed building and sharing a small en-suite bathroom.

Labour MP Steve Reed says local people have reported groups of up to 50 people now hanging around the area's famous parks and fear services could be swamped.

He said: 'The hotel is on the edge of our small but thriving shopping centre in a highly residential area.

'It seems highly inappropriate to place so many asylum seekers in an area like this without warning or preparation.

'Local residents aren't against immigrants, but are worried about the impact of having so many people who are new to the country move into the area.'

It is believed the hotel recently changed hands and made itself open to take referrals from the Home Office

Pictures show the building was once a traditional Bed and Breakfast, with a snooker room and bar area

But concerns have been raised that it was not built to house so many people and may now be unsafe

Mr Reed added: 'Large groups of people have been seen in local parks and some have women say they feel intimidated when out and about.

'I am also worried about the safety of people living in the hotel, which has recently been converted into a hostel.'

Mr Reed believes the hotel  changed hands earlier this year and started welcoming asylum seekers, but was quickly inundated with people sent by the Home Office.

He has demanded immigration ministers visit the area and hear residents' concerns.

The Home Office  insists it is doing all it can to reduce the number of people housed in the buildings after details of the council's inspection came to light.

A spokesman said: 'We are taking urgent steps with our housing providers to reduce the number of people living at the Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace.

'We have ensured that the numbers in accommodation at this location meet appropriate requirements.'

Local MP Steve Reed said the area, which overlooks the City of London, cannot take so many newcomers

Nearby residents have expressed concern about the impact on local services and women have reported feeling intimidated when walking through local parks
