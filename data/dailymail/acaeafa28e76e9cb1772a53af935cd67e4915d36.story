Inter Milan stormed into the group stage of the Europa League by thrashing UMF Stjarnan -0, but Spanish side Real Sociedad were stunned by Russian side FK Krasnodar.

Croatian striker Mateo Kovacic scored a stunning hattrick, including a majestic solo effort, as the Italians ran out 9-0 winners on aggregate, with former Southampton striker Pablo Osvaldo also finding the net. 

Sociedad, however, will have to do without European football this season. The Spaniards, who drew with Manchester United in the Champions League last year, crashed out of the competition despite holding a 1-0 aggregage lead going into the last 20 minutes of their second leg against Krasnodar.

Heading home: Pablo Osvaldo rises highest to score Inter's third goal in an extremely comfortable win

Three and easy: Mateo Kovacic scores for Inter. The 20-year-old striker bagged a hattrick against UMF Stjarnan

But a penalty from Joãozinho in the 71st minute leveled the tie before Mauricio Pereyra and Ari scored in the final two minutes to win the game for the Russians.

Elsewhere Borussia Monchengladbach put seven goals past FK Sarajevo and Villarreal scored four unaswered goals at home to FC Astana to book their place in the group stage.

The tie of the round though was between Rapid Vienna and HJK Helsinki. Rapid raced into a 2-0 lead, overturning the 2-1 deficit they suffered in the first leg.

But HJK hit back, taking a 3-2 lead on the night before the Austrians bagged a late consolation goal. HJK progressed 5-4 on aggregate.

Battle: Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela tussles with Ricardo Laborde but Sociedad were outfought

Over: Joaozinho was sent off  but Krasnodar had already done the damage to Sociedad's European hopes
