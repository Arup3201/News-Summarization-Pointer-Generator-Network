fire, while police officers were conducting house to house enquiries.

Four ambulance crews and three rapid response vehicles attended the scene along with the Midlands Air Ambulance.

'A man in his 30s had back pain and suspected wrist and ankle fractures. He had also breathed in smoke. He was given oxygen and was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.'

Neighbour Eric Sylvester, 24, said he had woken up to desperate screams just before 7am.
Post-grad student Eric, whose house backs on to the destroyed property, said: 'It was horrible.

'It woke me up and I heard people screaming. I looked outside my window and saw smoke and a huge fire. We rushed around to the house and called the fire brigade.

'Five minutes later they had to bring the body of the one lady out. It was really terrible, it was not a nice thing to see.'

Another neighbour, who didn't want to be named, added: 'I heard screaming at 6.45am. Two men in the back garden were asking them to jump. I saw them jump from the windows and I called the fire brigade.

'I could see flames on the outside windows and the flames started coming out of the windows.

'The windows were falling out and braking.'
