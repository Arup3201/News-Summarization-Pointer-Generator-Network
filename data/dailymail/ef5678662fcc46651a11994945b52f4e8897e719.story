A final scene of 'American Sniper' showing Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's gory death at a rifle range was cut after the victim's wife urged  screenwriters to leave it out for the sake of their young children.

The $264million box-office sensation, which was released last month, was supposed to end with Kyle, 38, being shot dead at the range by 27-year-old Eddie Ray Routh in Stephenville, Texas, in 2013.

But after the late father-of-two's widow, Taya, pleaded with director Clint Eastwood and other execs not to include the horrific moment in the film, it was omitted, screenwriter Jason Hall has revealed.

'We talked about doing it but... five days after Chris was murdered, [Mrs Kyle] called and said, "This is going to be how my children remember their father, so I want you to get right",' Mr Hall said.

Distraught: A final scene of 'American Sniper' showing Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's death at a rifle range was cut after the victim's wife, Taya (pictured crying in court last week) urged screenwriters to leave it out

Couple: The widow (pictured with Kyle before his 2013 death) pleaded with director Clint Eastwood and other executives not to include her husband's shooting in the film for the sake of their children, then eight and six

Blockbuster hit: Mrs Kyle 'called and said, "This is going to be how my children remember their father, so I want you to get right",' screenwriter Jason Hall said. Above, Bradley Cooper portrays Kyle in the movie

He added that Mrs Kyle's request had affected him as a father. 'I didn't want this movie hanging over [the kids'] heads for the rest of their lives as the film that showed their father getting shot,' he said.

'American Sniper', which stars actor Bradley Cooper as Kyle, was already in production when Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were gunned down by Routh, a Marine with PTSD, in February 2013. 

Within days, the film's creators had penned five different endings for the movie, all of which featured the two soldiers being shot dead at the range. 'We talked about how we would shoot it,' said Mr Hall.

But after Mrs Kyle's request, screenwriters decided to scrap the possible endings and replace them with an epilogue explaining what happened to Kyle, whose children were eight and six at the time.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, Mr Hall said: 'In the end, I think we felt this was a film on Chris's life and not about his death. And we also wanted to be careful not to glorify the guy that did it.'

The featured ending of 'American Sniper', which has been accused by some of glorifying murder and serving as war propaganda, just shows Kyle and Littlefield arriving at Rough Creek Lodge rifle range.

During his interview with the newspaper, Mr Hall also condemned critics of the movie, which is based on Kyle's autobiography and has been nominated for six Oscars, saying any reaction  'is a good one'.

He added that many veterans' associations have told him the film has sparked discussions about soldiers' lives after they return from war in comments that mirrored  ones made by Michelle Obama.

Two weeks ago, the US First Lady declared 'American Sniper' 'touches on many of the emotions and experiences that I've heard firsthand from military families over these past few years.' 

Speaking at the launch of '6 Certified', she added: 'We hope our country will welcome back our veterans, not by setting them apart but by fully integrating them into the fabric of our communities.'

Routh is currently on trial for shooting dead Kyle and Littlefield at the rifle range. There is no doubt that he was responsible for shooting the sniper, who has the most kills to his name in U.S. history.

Emotional: Last Wednesday, Mrs Kyle was pictured wiping her eyes with a tissue (pictured) as she testified during 27-year-old Routh's capital murder trial at the Erath County Donald R. Jones Justice Center in Texas

Widow: Mrs Kyle wore a brown dress, a brown shawl and crosses around her neck for Wednesday's trial

Support: Mrs Kyle greets a supporter before court is in session during Routh's high-profile murder trial

The former Marine has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At the end of the trial, jurors must decide whether or not he intentionally committed the murders and knew his actions were wrong.

Last week, Gene Cole, a former patrol deputy, said Routh confessed to killing Kyle and Littlefield 'because they wouldn't talk to me' while he was an inmate at Eratch County Jail in June 2013.

Dressed in his police uniform, he told the court: 'I heard Mr Routh say, "I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the backseat of the truck, and nobody would talk to me.'

He added that Routh believed Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield had forgiven him. '[He told me], "I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me",' he said.

On Wednesday, Mrs Kyle was pictured wiping her tear-filled eyes as she testified during Routh's capital murder trial at the Erath County Donald R. Jones Justice Center. The trial continues.
