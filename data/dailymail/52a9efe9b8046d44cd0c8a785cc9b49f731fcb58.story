The shambles surrounding Blackpool FC took a dramatic turn on Thursday with the club’s Latvian president Valeri Belokon demanding that the Oyston family spend a final parachute payment worth millions of pounds purely on footballing matters.

In an open letter to chairman Karl Oyston and majority shareholder Owen Oyston, which has been seen by MailOnline, Belokon – who owns a 20 per cent stake in the club – also accuses the Oyston family of paying themselves tens of millions of pounds.

The Latvian businessman then insists that the Oystons put their final parachute payment of between £8m and £9m - which is due soon from the Premier League, along with £3.5m in TV money from the Football League - into a joint account which can only be spent on footballing matters.

In the 
letter, Belokon, whose funds helped to sign players such as Charlie Adam
 as the Seasiders earned a surprise promotion to the 
top flight in 2010 under Ian Holloway, reveals that Owen Oyston failed to respond to a 
recent invite to meet him to discuss his concerns.

Belokon
 writes: ‘Dear Owen and Karl, since Blackpool FC were promoted to the 
Premier League you have paid yourself more than £11.5m in salaries and, 
in addition, more than £24m via interest-free loans to your various 
companies, all without my approval.

‘At
 the same time we have seen the squad that Ian Holloway put together 
with my assistance, and which richly entertained all true football fans,
 dismantled with our beloved club nearly being relegated from the 
Championship last season.

‘I
 am alarmed to see that only two weeks before the start of the season, 
we are in the unacceptable position of only having eight registered 
players and little sign of the Premier League parachute payments being 
spent where they should be, on the team, the stadium and training 
ground.

‘Now
 it is time to pay back what you have taken and finally "Put Football 
First". In the name of Blackpool FC, I kindly ask you to deposit all 
remaining incoming Premier League and Football League funds into a 
public escrow account in our joint names and only release these funds 
for the purpose of creating a competitive football team.’

Blackpool’s
 first League game is at Nottingham Forest a fortnight on Saturday. They
 currently only have eight players signed on, as new manager Jose Riga 
and Karl Oyston have been locked in a stand-off over transfer targets.

The
 embarrassing scenario was emphasised earlier on Thursday when non-league 
Alfreton had to call off a friendly against Blackpool on Saturday 
because the Championship club had ‘failed to confirm’ the fixture.

Karl Oyston did not respond to MailOnline enquiries on Thursday.
