Teenage sensation Martin Odegaard showed why he's being billed as Europe's hottest property by inspiring Stromsgodset to a 2-1 league victory.

The 15-year-old, who has been linked with Liverpool and Manchester United, scored both goals against Lillestrom on Sunday.

Odegaard opened the scoring with a superb run and shot in the 21st minute and grabbed his second in the 41st minute by starting and finishing a move with a clinical strike.

Norway's Martin Odegaard comes on as a sub against Bulgaria to become the Euros' youngest every player

 

Odegaard became the youngest player in the  history of the European Championship when he came on as a substitute in Norway's 2-1 victory over Bulgaria.

Aged 15 years and 300 days, Odegaard replaced Cardiff's Mats Moller Daelhi in the 63rd minute, as goals from Tarik Elyounoussi and Havard Nielsen either side of a Nikolay Bodurov equaliser saw the hosts run out winners at the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo.

The European Championship has been running since 1960 and Odegaard beat the previous record held by Sigurdur Jonsson of Iceland, who had held it since playing in a Euro 1984 qualifier aged 16 and 251 days.

1. Martin Odegaard (Norway) 15 yrs, 300 days

2. Sigurdur Jonsson (Iceland) 16 yrs, 251 days 

3. Peter Jehle (Liechtenstein) 16 yrs, 265 days

4. Levan Kenia (Georgia) 16 yrs, 325 days

5. Daniel Frick (Liechtenstein) 17 yrs, 79 days 

The appearance of Odegaard in the Group H Euro 2016 qualifier will have been noted Europe's biggest clubs, who have already been hot on the tail of the wonderkid likened to Lionel Messi.

Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid lead the hunt, while Odegaard has been to England to train with Manchester United and has spent time in Germany with Bayern, Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund. 

Liverpool are also keen on the Stromsgodset star, aware that Martin and his father Hans-Erik are lifelong Reds supporters.

Odegaard made his debut for Norway on August 27 in a friendly against United Arab Emirates and came on against Bulgaria in Oslo with his side pushing for a winner.

The record for the youngest player to actually appear in the European Championship finals is Jetro Willems, who at 18 years and 71 days came on for Holland in their Euro 2012 group stage match with Denmark.

So another record could be in Odegaard's sight should Norway's positive start in qualification continue and take them to France for the 2016 finals.
