Talk show host and comedian Bill Maher sparked controversy during his Friday night show when he warned against crossing the 'gay mafia'.

His comments, made on the online-only segment of Real Time, were made as the panel discussed how the Mozilla chief executive had been forced to stand down over his support of a ban on gay marriage.

Maher responded to the discussion on the HBO show by saying: 'I think there is a gay mafia. I think if you cross them you do get whacked.'

His warning of a 'gay mafia' came as guests on the show discussed how a donation Brendan Eich had made to a group campaigning against Proposition 8 led to him having to leave Mozilla.

'So this guy apparently does not want gay people to get married, and he had to step down. What do you think of that?' Maher asked the panel.

Republican Tom Davis, a guest on the show, replied: 'I guess he gave $1,000 eight years ago, and it's come back to haunt him.'

Footage of the show, shown on Blaze, showed the guests laughing as Maher made his 'gay mafia' comment, but on Twitter there was shock that the host had referred to the LGBT community as the 'gay mafia'.

While some tweets appeared to back Maher's claims, others saw it as a sign of the inequality still faced, with many tweeting 'the struggle continues'.

Eich's abrupt departure from Mozilla has stirred the debate over the fairness of forcing out a highly qualified technology executive over his personal views and a single campaign contribution six years ago.

And it raises questions about how far corporate leaders are allowed to go in expressing their political views.

The National Organization for Marriage, which backed California's same-sex marriage ban, called on consumers to boycott the Firefox browser.

Organization president Brian Brown said Eich had been the 'target of a vicious character attack by gay activists who have forced him out of the company he has helped lead for years'.

Mozilla chairwoman Mitchell Baker touched on the delicate balancing act in her Thursday post announcing Eich's resignation.

'Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech. Equality is necessary for meaningful speech. And you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard,' she wrote.
