Premier League sponsors Barclays will not renew their £40million-a-year deal when the current agreement expires at the end of the 2015-16 season.

The bank agreed a £120m three-year deal in 2012 for the present rights - an increase of almost 50 per cent on their previous £82m contract.

But with Sky and BT Sport paying a record £5.1billion for TV rights from the start of the 2016 season, Barclays fear the cost of the next sponsorship will also rise considerably.

Barclays have sponsored the Premier League since 2001 when they first used the sponsorship to promote their Barclaycard brand.  

As well as the cost of the sponsorship, they must also consider the costs of promoting it through advertising, public relations and social media.

The popularity of the Premier League abroad is seen as a major factor behind the bank's decision to continue with their sponsorship for almost 15 years.

With games broadcast into 650 million homes in 175 countries, Barclays have used their agreements to promote themselves throughout the world, particularly in Africa and Asia.
