It's all they're talking about down Stonegate's local pub - just who is the notorious great train robber in their midst?

But two days on, and still no-one in the East Sussex village has let slip the name of the high-flying executive who avoided paying almost £43,000 in train tickets for his daily commute into London.

'I've lived here 30 years and I've never heard anything like it,' said Lucy Enville, 78. 'It's hot gossip at the moment.'

She's not the only one eager to find out who the mysterious the fare-dodging hedge fund manager is.

Rural: The hedge fund manager, who dodged £43,000 in rail fares over five years, began his journey into London at Stonegate train station in East Sussex, which has no ticket barriers

A hairdresser, who did not want to be 
named, said: 'I've had lots of clients talking about it. No one knows 
who it is. I know a few hedge fund managers around here but I couldn't 
possibly disclose their names.'

On
 Sunday it was revealed that over five years, the hedge fund manager 
dodged the £24.50-each-way fare while travelling from his home in the 
sought-after village to his place of work in the city.

The
 unnamed man, who is believed to be the biggest fare dodger in history, 
exploited a loophole that allowed him to pay only a third of the actual 
cost of his 1hour 22minute journey.

In
 the nearby village of Ticehurst, a waitress told The Independent that 
Southeastern trains should have been 'more on the ball'.

'It serves them right,' she said. 'How did he get away with it for five years? It puts the rail system to shame.'

He caught the commuter train from Stonegate - a rural station with no barriers or ticket machine and only a part-time ticket office - without purchasing a fare.

Free pass: He would arrive at London Bridge station and transfer to another platform, for a service to Cannon Street, while avoiding the barriers

Final destination: He would reach Cannon Street in Central London, only paying £7.20 - a third of the rail fare

Once in London, the executive was then
 able to pass through the barriers at Cannon Street by simply 'tapping 
out' with an Oyster Travelcard paying just £7.20.

But
 his scam was finally exposed by a ticket inspector and, in an 
out-of-court settlement, he paid Southeastern trains back the £42,550 in
 dodged fares and £450 legal cost within three days.

The
 cost of a standard-class single fare from Stonegate - where the average
 home cost half a million pounds - to London is £24.50 while an annual 
season ticket costs £4,548.

Cheating the system: The unnamed commuter would only 'tap out' his Oyster card once on his journey

According
 to a report in the Sunday Times, the senior executive is believed to 
have travelled into London without buying any ticket and avoiding 
detection from 2008 until the end of last year.

He
 was able to get off his train at London Bridge and cross a platform to 
catch a service to Cannon Street - again avoiding having to go through 
any barriers.

At Cannon 
Street, he used an Oyster card to exit the barriers, paying the then 
maximum £7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having 
tapped in.

But on November 
25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he
 had paid £7.20 and not the £2.30 for a single ticket.

After
 being challenged, the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct 
fare on five journeys between London Bridge and Cannon Street.

However,
 suspicious investigators for Southeastern discovered that the man had 
for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket 
from Stonegate.

And within 
five days of being caught out at Cannon Street, the executive renewed 
his season ticket, leading Southeastern to believe he had been dodging 
the fare for his commute for five years.

Despite
 never admitting to this, the executive offered to settle the matter out
 of court and paid up within three days of being notified by the train 
operator the total owed in dodged tickets.

Southeastern, who has not named the man, said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court.

The
 train company told the Sunday Times that the executive wanted to 
protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would 
have on his job.

A spokesperson added: 'All customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him.

'The customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process.' However, crtiics have questioned why the fare dodging executive was allowed to escape being prosecuted and remain anonymous.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said in the report: 'It is not only extraordinary that the biggest fare dodger in railway history got away with it for so long, but has also now escaped criminal prosecution as well.'
