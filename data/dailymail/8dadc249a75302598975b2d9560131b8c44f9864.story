The NHS is under so much strain, medical students are being drafted in to do unpaid hospital shifts, The Mail on Sunday has learnt.

Fifth-year students at Leeds University have been asked to ‘undertake extra shift and weekend work’ in local hospitals, according to a leaked email from Professor Paul Stewart, dean of its medical school. 

Keen: Students last night said they were keen to help, but one said: ‘There is no way of dressing this up as anything other than desperation'

Unpaid: Students at Leeds University asked to do 'extra shift and weekend work' and professor told them: ‘We have no doubt you will rise to the occasion'

Students are not being forced to do the extra shifts, which come on top of their normal placements, but Prof Stewart wrote: ‘We have no doubt you will rise to the occasion.’

Volunteers will get travel expenses and a ‘subsistence’ allowance.
