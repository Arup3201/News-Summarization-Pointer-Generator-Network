Missing: Timothy Andrew MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire, with one of his two children

The pregnant wife of a Navy sailor who has gone missing in Dubai has made an appeal for information about his disappearance.

Father-of-two Timothy Andrew MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire,  failed to return to HMS Westminster before it left the United Arab Emirates country yesterday.

Routine checks were carried out by the 
Navy before the Portsmouth-based warship sailed, but they could not 
locate the leading seaman and local authorities were alerted.

Known to his family as Timmy, the sailor has not been seen since getting into a taxi at around 2am last Sunday. 

It is known that he had just
left the Rock Bottom Bar which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of 
Deira.

The bar is approximately a 15 minute drive from Port Rashid where 
HMS Westminster was docked.

Last seen by a shipmate, he was alone when he got in the taxi.

Today his wife Rachael who is expecting their third child in October made a plea from her Gosport home for help in finding her husband.

'We are appealing to the people of Dubai and reaching out to the large 
ex-pat community to help us find Timmy and raise awareness in that area.

'We are desperately worried. Checks have been made with hospitals, 
prisons, police stations, medical stations and mortuaries and there is 
no record of him and no sightings so far.

'I last spoke with Timmy at midday on Saturday and he was in really good
spirits and looking forward to speaking with the children on Skype on 
Sunday. That call never happened.

Family man: Today his wife Rachael who is expecting their third child in October made a plea for help in finding her husband. 'It is completely out of character for him not to contact us, and we are completely at a loss and going crazy with worry,' she said

'It is completely out of character for 
him not to contact us, and we are completely at a loss and going crazy 
with worry.

'Wherever Timmy is, I know that he wants to be found, he will want us to
find him, we need people to help us do that.

He may be in trouble 
somewhere, he could be trapped as far as we know, we have absolutely no 
idea. 

Please, please help us find him.'

The couple have two children aged two and four.

Originally from Killin, in Scotland, Mr MacColl was serving on the ship which arrived in Dubai on May 26 and departed yesterday.

Departed: Routine checks were carried out by the Navy before the HMS Westminster sailed, but they could not locate the leading seaman and local authorities were alerted

Concerning: The sailor, right, has not been seen since getting into a taxi at around 2am last Sunday. It is known that he had just left the Rock Bottom Bar, left, which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of Deira

A MoD spokesperson said:

'We have one sailor who is currently unaccounted for in Dubai; everything is being done to ensure that he is located safely. His next of kin has been informed.

'We are working closely with the local authorities and FCO representatives in the UAE to establish his whereabouts.

'We take great care to look after all members of the Naval Service wherever they serve around the world.'
