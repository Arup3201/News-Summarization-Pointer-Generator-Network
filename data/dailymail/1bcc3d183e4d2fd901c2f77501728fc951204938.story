A large bang heard by hundreds across the country last night was a sonic boom caused by two Typhoon aircraft responding to an emergency, the Ministry of Defence said.

The RAF jets were despatched to a small civilian helicopter that had emitted an emergency signal on a frequency it should not have been using, but the error was realised too late.

An MoD spokesman said the fighter planes, scrambled from RAF Conningsby, in Lincolnshire, had been authorised to go supersonic and were already on their way to the helicopter.

Confusion: A large bang heard by hundreds across the country last night was a sonic boom caused by two Typhoon aircraft, like this one pictured, responding to an emergency, the Ministry of Defence said

He said: 'We can confirm that a small 
civilian aircraft was transmitting inadvertently on an emergency 
frequency at approximately 6.10pm.

'Two
typhoons from the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) responded accordingly and 
authorisation was given from them to go supersonic, which resulted in 
the sonic boom.

'There was no actual threat to the civilian aircraft and they soon rectified their mistake.'

The £125m jets triggered a string of 999 calls across 150 miles of English countryside as they caused a huge sonic boom while smashing the sound barrier.

But the incident turned out to be a false alarm when it emerged the red-faced helicopter pilot, flying near Bath, Somerset, had broadcast the emergency signal by mistake.

Sound alert: The jets broke the speed of sound - causing a large boom to be heard for hundreds of miles across the country - and raced to the aid of the helicopter, flying near Bath, Somerset

The bang resulted in a deluge of 
calls to police forces across the West Midlands, Warwickshire, 
Oxfordshire, Somerset and Wiltshire were inundated with calls following 
the massive boom on Thursday.

Buildings and houses were reportedly shaken, stunning residents and baffling emergency services from across the three counties.

A number of concerned locals witnessed the dramatic scene as one of the Typhoon jets tailed the helicopter.

Donna
Bunton, from Shoscombe, near Bath, saw one of the Typhoon jets tailing 
the helicopter - before snapping the dramatic scene on her camera.

She
said: 'I first heard a massive sonic boom. We get Hercules aircraft 
flying over here quite a bit - but this was louder than that.

'I then saw this helicopter, with the jet tailing it. It was so low you could see its triangle shape.

'The Typhoon was swaying behind it from side to side - I have never seen anything like it before.

'I went inside to grab my camera, then took a quick picture as it was flying off.'

The jets broke the speed of sound - causing a large boom to be heard for hundreds of miles across the country - and raced to the aid of the helicopter, flying near Bath, Somerset.

Concern: The loud bang was heard in Swindon, Bath, Coventry and Oxford (above), leading to fears it may have been an explosion or underground tremor

But they were called back to their base after it emerged the aircraft had only broadcast the emergency signal in error.

A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shockwaves created when an object travels through the air and breaks the sound barrier.

The noise contains large amounts of sound energy, meaning sonic booms are often mistaken for explosions.

Speculation about what could have caused the noise ranged from a large explosion to an underground tremor.

It is the second time this year that a sonic boom has been created by a Typhoon aircraft.

In January, the MoD confirmed that a loud noise heard by people across the North of England was caused by an RAF fighter jet breaking the sound barrier.

Dan Cross, bar and restaurant supervisor at Millsy's in Earlsdon, Coventry, said the noise was so forceful it shook the walls of the restaurant.

'It sounded like it was coming from the kitchen,' he said. 'I thought somebody had dropped one of the big ovens in there.

'It was a really loud bang and the room shook and all the wine glasses on the rack shook.

'When it wasn't coming from the kitchen I thought maybe it was the cellar, but then wondered if it could be something else.

'It was weird, but didn't last long.'

Jennifer Lawlor, a supervisor at the Spar shop in Daventry Road, said she did not experience anything, but her boyfriend, Martin Ward, rang her and told her the walls of his house were shaking.

'He said there were two very loud bangs and he felt the room was shaking,' she said.

'He lives up in Stoke and is off work sick at the moment so wasn't sure what it was - he thought he might be hallucinating.

'He was actually quite freaked out by it and I had to tell him he wasn't going mad and lots of people were talking about it.'

The jets were scrambled because the frequency the helicopter pilot mistakenly transmitted on is only used when an aircraft is in particular trouble.

Such a signal could indicate the aircraft had been hijacked or had 'gone rogue'.
