When Suzanne Shaw married Peter Cook on the back of his tumultuous divorce with supermodel Christie Brinkley, she chose to ignore the warnings.

But in a complete reversal, Shaw has now written to Brinkley to personally apologize for not heeding her cautions about Cook's philandering.

Cook's marriage to Brinkley collapsed in a very bitter and public divorce trial in 2008 following revelations he had an affair with his 18-year-old assistant Diana Bianchi.

While Bianchi, now 29, has since gone on to marry a New York writer, Shaw has divorced from Cook and written a letter to Brinkley to try and mend their rift.

According to the New York Post, the letter stated: 'Christie and I have talked recently and I have privately apologized to her, but, given the public nature of their divorce and custody battle, I feel a public apology is also appropriate and deserved.

She added: 'Christie was wrongly vilified as being an embittered ex-wife.

'I’m deeply sorry for my part in causing Christie any unnecessary pain.' 

Meanwhile, the woman at the centre of the split between Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook six years ago has married.

Diana Bianchi, 29, was just 18 when architect Cook hired her as an assistant before seducing her in 2005.

The exposure of the affair between Cook and Bianchi ended his ten year marriage to supermodel Brinkley in  very public divorce proceedings in 2008.

Bianchi has now married food writer Aaron Arizpe from New York, and changed her last name.

'She was just a kid when [her affair with Cook] happened,' a family friend told the New York Post.

'She was a teenager. But things change, people change, they mature. She couldn't be happier now, and we're really happy for her.'

Bianchi, who was the daughter of the Brinkley-Cooks' neighbour, had a year-long affair with Cook which started in 2005 when Bianchi was 18 years old and working as his assistant.

Brinkley was told of the affair in 2007 and ended their ten-year marriage which saw her and Cook embark on a very public court battle.

During the 2008 divorce, the court was told that Cook had paid Bianchi $300,000 in the hope she would keep the liaison quiet.

The 60-year-old supermodel gained sole custody of their daughter Sailor, now 16, and 19-year-old Jack, the son of her ex Richard Taubman but  later adopted by Peter Cook.
