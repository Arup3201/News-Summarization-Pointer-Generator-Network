Daniel Sturridge's latest injury while on international duty with England means the Liverpool striker has now been sidelined 11 times in the 20 months he's been at Anfield.

The 25-year-old quickly became a fan favourite at Liverpool, scoring 36 goals in just 52 games following his £12million move from Chelsea in January 2013.

His latest thigh injury, however, will keep Sturridge out of action for at least three weeks and has even prompted Reds boss Brendan Rodgers to hit out at England's treatment of the striker during the two week international break.

Sturridge was injured during a training session he had reportedly asked to sit out on and as a result was forced to miss England's 2-0 Euro 2016 qualifier win against Switzerland with a thigh strain.

The former Manchester City youngster has now suffered six separate thigh injuries while at Liverpool adding to his previous hip, hamstring and ankle problems.

Despite playing the full 90 minutes in each of Liverpool's three Premier League games so far and 89 minutes for England against Norway, Sturridge clearly has to be managed carefully if Rodgers is to get the most from his considerable talents.

Discussing his player's latest injury, Rodgers said: 'We’re disappointed because we feel it’s an injury which could have been prevented

'I think clubs work differently at times to international teams. It’s more the recovery strategy. When we look at our players here, we look at them individually in terms of what their needs are.'

Liverpool look set to be compensated for the loss of Sturridge as the FA prepare to pay the Anfield club up to £200,000 — three weeks’ of Sturridge’s wages.

Rodgers' concern at his striker's latest injury will leave the Liverpool boss without his main man for at least four games with Sturridge targeting the Merseyside derby on September 27 as a possible return. 

Fortunately for the Liverpool faithful, Sturridge only averages between three to four weeks in the treatment room, but his latest muscle twinge will no doubt leave Reds fans dreading the next international break.
