Three sisters who helped deliver a baby outside a Primark store in Birmingham have told how the mother went from clothes shopping to giving birth in just 'four minutes'.

Emma Sheffield, 25, and her sisters Melissa Sheffield, 27, and Kelly Ryder, 29, were the first to comfort the woman who unexpectedly went into labour in the city's New Street yesterday.

They have told how they saw the shape of the baby's head through the woman's leggings and managed to remove them just in time.

Ms Sheffield said: 'Her face was glowing red. We asked her again if she was OK and when she was due and she told us: "Anytime now".'

Kelly Ryder, 29, Emma Sheffield, 25, and Melissa Sheffield, 28, helped a new mum give birth outside Birmingham's Primark store yesterday. They have now told of the speed of the delivery

All smiles: The mother was wheeled away from the busy street on a trolley after the successful labour

Reliving 
the episode, Ms Sheffield added: 'We were talking to a woman doing market 
research just outside Primark when we noticed a pregnant lady walking 
out of the store looking hot and flustered.

'We
 all looked at each other alarmed and then the woman bent over a 
bollard. Kelly asked her if she was OK, and she said she wasn't feeling 
any pain. But we all thought she looked like she was in labour.'

As they tried to move the pregnant woman into an alleyway, they saw the baby's head emerge beneath her clothes.

Ms Sheffield added: 'Kelly saw the shape of the baby's head in her leggings - the baby had already started to come out.

'Kelly
 shouted "The baby's head - someone needs to grab the baby". I grabbed 
the head in the mum's leggings and the others laid the woman down on the
 floor.

'Then Kelly and I tried to rip the leggings down. That was when I
 saw and held the baby's head properly for the first time.

'She was so beautiful and crying. After the baby came out the mum was lying there saying: "Oh my god it's a girl".

'We heard her tell a girl in the pushchair that this was her little sister.'

Thie woman suddenly went into labour in Birmingham city centre and was forced to give birth outside Primark

Pulling the sheets across: The paramedics shield the woman from the curious shoppers

A doctor then arrived and cared for the mother and newborn baby until an ambulance arrived.

Ms
 Sheffield said: 'It was all so fast and surreal. It must have been four 
minutes from when we saw her come out of Primark to the baby being born.

'I think the new mum was stunned and hardly said a word. I don't think she expected to give birth there and then.'

Crowds of shoppers cheered when the newborn baby girl was placed on her mother's chest, before the pair were helped into an ambulance.

Witnesses
 have told how well-wishers organised a whip-round for the new mother, 
who was handed hundreds of pounds by passing shoppers.

Shop worker Nadia Hussain told the BBC 
the crowds were happy to contribute, adding: 'She got about £300 to 
£400. The mother was waving at everyone, telling everyone to film her.'

Another 
shop keeper nearby said the woman was giving birth for about ten minutes
 before paramedics arrived and held sheets around the woman.

It’s believed kind-hearted Primark staff brought out towels from the shop to help.

The new mother 
and her baby, who was born on this sport, were taken to hospital and are reported to be doing well

A shop keeper working near the scene said the woman was giving birth for about ten minutes before paramedics arrived and held the sheets around her

One onlooker said: 'We were just walking out of Primark when I saw a crowd of people.

'We thought it was a street performance act. It was only when I walked out that I realised it was a woman giving birth.

'She seemed to be by herself and there were no medics there. She can’t 
have been there very long as I didn’t see her when we went in.'

They added: 'It
 must have literally just whooshed out because someone had just placed 
it on her chest and everyone cheered. The placenta hadn’t even come out 
yet.'

A
 West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson said: 'A call came into us
 at 13.56pm to say there was a woman in labour on New Street.

'Thankfully an off-duty doctor happened to be there at the time who stepped into help.

'We
 sent two ambulances and a rapid response vehicle.  It’s a baby girl and
 it is doing OK and both ambulances handed mother and baby over to City 
Hospital.'
