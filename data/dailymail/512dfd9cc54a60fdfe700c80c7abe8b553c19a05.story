Nikea Short was in her car at a set of traffic lights when she glanced at her rear view mirror and saw a truck speeding towards her.

She screamed at the top of her lungs and started thinking about her family and friends, certain that she was about to die.

'I thought "This is it, my time's up",' Ms Short told Daily Mail Australia.

'It hit me at 80km per hour, full force, whilst I was stationary, and it was a domino effect - I then hit four other cars.'

The 27-year-old fashion blogger says she is lucky to have walked away from the crash but suffers chronic pain

Ms Short, a fashion blogger who lives in Melbourne, stayed conscious after the crash even though she smashed her head multiple times on the seat and steering wheel.

'I thought the car was on fire from all the fumes,' she said.

'I panicked and I tried to push open my door and I managed to stumble out.

'I was in a great deal of shock so I was hurting a lot hurt - my spine, my tailbone and especially my head and my neck - but at the time I just thought I've got to get out.'

Ms Short stumbled out and was helped by a witness who held her up until an ambulance arrived.

Since the accident in September 2013, the 27-year-old's life has completely changed.

Ms Short's spine was damaged, but the most debilitating condition the crash gave her was the chronic pain that she now struggles to cope with every day.

'I was very lucky to walk away,' she said.

'I know how lucky I am and I'm not in a wheelchair, but I have an invisible illness which is so hard to deal with.

'The pain is 24/7, it doesn't stop and it affects everything I do.

'It's so hard for people to understand what chronic pain is, that it's possible for your nervous system to take over your brain pretty much.'

Ms Short can't move her neck at all and she can't lift her arms above her head.

'l look normal but I can't move,' she said.

'I can't wash my hair on my own, I can't brush my hair, I can't drive my car.

She is trying to raise money via Go Fund Me for her living expenses and so that she can start working towards her goal of owning her own fashion label

'I can't go for long walks, I can't run, I can't bend over properly, I struggle to do up my shoelaces - so many little things.

'It's pretty much like it's just taken away my entire independence and my life.'

Ms Short was working for a fashion label and on track to achieve her dream of becoming a fashion designer, but had to quit her job after the accident.

Now she is trying to raise money via Go Fund Me for her living expenses and so that she can start working towards her fashion career goals at some point in the future.

'[My insurance payments] just cover my rent so it's got to the point where I'm actually going into so much debt because I can't afford to live,' she said.

On February 16 the truck driver who crashed into her car will appear in Sunshine Magistrates' Court, charged with the offence of 'driving in a manner dangerous to the public'

On February 16 the truck driver who crashed into her car will appear in Sunshine Magistrates' Court, charged with the offence of 'driving in a manner dangerous to the public'. 

At the end of February Ms Short will go to hospital where she will spend a month undergoing chronic pain management therapy.

'With that I hope that I may slowly be able to sit for a bit longer so I can draw, or sit at the computer for longer or blog more,' she said.

'I was working for my dreams, I've always wanted to be a fashion designer, I had studied really hard and I was quite fit and was really enjoying life.

'To go from having everything I had sort of hoped for to absolutely nothing it really hit home that life is too short, you have to really take each day as it comes, and try not to think too far ahead or dwell on the past.' 

Now she is trying to raise money via Go Fund Me for her living expenses and so that she can start working towards her fashion career goals at some point in the future.
