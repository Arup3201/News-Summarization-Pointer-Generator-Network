The  three-year-old girl at the centre of a South Carolina 
adoption dispute because of her Native American history is just two percent Cherokee, it has been revealed. 

Her biological mother Christy Maldonado is Hispanic and was 
unmarried when she got pregnant and gave birth to Veronica - since then she has worked closely with a non-Indian 
couple hopeful of adopting her daughter.

But when Veronica's biological father, Dusten
Brown, found out he secured custody based on his Cherokee Nation ancestry 
and the couple who  looked after the girl from birth until 19 months ago were forced to hand her over.

Yesterday it was revealed that Christy Maldonado is suing the federal government, saying a law governing
the placement of Indian children is unconstitutional.

In her lawsuit, filed Wednesday in 
federal court in South Carolina, Christy Maldonado asks U.S. Attorney 
General Eric Holder for a declaration that parts of the Indian Child 
Welfare Act are illegal.

Those measures – which include a 
preference for 'other Indian families' over prospective non-Indian 
adoptive parents – should be nixed because the law uses race in 
determining with whom a child should live and therefore violates equal 
protection provisions, Maldonado argues.

The act was passed in 1978 to reduce 
the number of Indian children being removed from their homes by public 
and private agencies and placed with non-Indian families.

Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in 2009

The law, Maldonado said in the 
lawsuit, was enacted with good intentions but ended up 'sweeping within 
it children who do not have, and would not have – but for ICWA – any 
connection whatsoever to any Tribe other than biology ... and 
irrespective of whether their sole custodial birth mothers – their only 
legal parents – have even a trace of Indian blood.'

Maldonado's lawsuit includes 10 
unnamed plaintiffs who are also unmarried mothers of children of Indian 
heritage who, because of the federal law, fear the adoptions of their 
children won't be finalized because the prospective parents are 
non-Indians, according to court documents.

Maldonado's lawsuit also names the 
Cherokee Nation as a defendant.

Spokeswomen for both the nation and the 
federal government did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.

Native American tribes across the U.S. see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions

'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011

A Charleston-area couple has been 
trying to adopt Maldonado's daughter since the girl's birth.

Veronica 
lived with Matt and Melanie Capobianco for the first two years of her 
life but has been with her biological father since 2011, when the South 
Carolina Supreme Court ruled that, because of the federal law, Dusten 
Brown should have preference because of his Cherokee heritage.

A
member of the Cherokee Nation, Brown had never met his daughter and, 
after the girl's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, 
played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the 
girl was born.

But 
when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and 
said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning 
tribal traditions.

The Capobiancos appealed that 
decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled this year that federal 
law did not actually require that Veronica be given back to her Cherokee father.

But the ruling didn't directly award 
the girl to the Capobiancos, instead leaving it to South Carolina courts
to decide where Veronica should end up.

Last week, the state Supreme Court 
ordered a family court to finalize the Capobiancos' adoption of the 
girl, a decision that court upheld Wednesday.

No formal transition timetable has 
been set. Brown is also pursuing custody of her in Oklahoma, and his 
parents also are seeking guardianship through the Cherokee court system

Several American Indian groups have said they plan to file their own federal lawsuit to protect Veronica's interests.
