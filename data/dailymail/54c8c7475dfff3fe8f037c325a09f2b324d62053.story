It is just as well Stoke substitute Peter Crouch salvaged a stoppage-time point with a header to rival Harry Kane’s super nod, for Mark Hughes’ bank balance could have taken a hit had defeat been allowed to amplify his rage.

The Potters boss was furious – with some justification - that referee Kevin Friend failed to dismiss Jack Colback moments before he fired what looked to be the winning goal.

The Newcastle midfielder was already in the book for a foul on Marc Muniesa when, needlessly charging to close down Victor Moses deep in the visiting half, he floored the winger. Friend, though, chose not to show a second yellow. It was a baffling decision and left Hughes incensed. Crouch’s equaliser, however, meant his post-match reflection was perhaps more considered, although his comments may yet be of interest to the FA.

‘The disappointment is that the referee wasn’t brave enough to make the right decision at a key moment in the game,’ he said.

‘Given the yellow cards which were dished out and the nature of them, for him not to give Colback a clear second yellow was disappointing. He needs to be stronger. The lad is allowed to stay on the pitch and scored the goal which nearly means we didn’t take something from the game. With them down to 10 men I think we would have won.

‘But there is no point (in speaking to the referee), the game has gone. I don’t think I’ll get an apology either, in all my years of management I’ve never had one, so I don’t expect it now.’

Colback, meanwhile, would have had no complaints had he been banished to the dressing-room.

‘If I'd seen a second yellow, I couldn't have felt too aggrieved,’ he said. ‘I caught him but you ride your luck sometimes.’

Hughes’ irritation was only soothed by the sight of Crouch towering to cushion Geoff Cameron’s deep hoist beyond the despairing glove of Tim Krul and underneath the crossbar.

And, after the eulogies which followed Kane’s effort to win Saturday’s North London derby, Hughes was keen to extol the aerial virtues of his veteran frontman.

‘If you listen to what has been said over the weekend then Harry Kane is only guy who scores goals like that, but that’s an oversight on Peter Crouch - he’s been doing that for a long time,’ he said.

‘Peter has been unlucky in the last few weeks not to start more games. But he’s very much valued at this club, that’s why we gave him a new contract. Coming on or starting, he will always have an impact – that’s a credit to him as a professional.’

As impressive as Crouch’s finish was, that Newcastle had committed so many bodies forward at that late juncture was unforgivable.

Head coach John Carver agreed, as he fumed: ‘There were two minutes left on the clock and we get a free-kick. It goes into the final third and we play four or five passes backwards and back to the keeper who kicks it. We were out of shape and before you know it’s in the back of the net. That’s unprofessional. With two minutes left you should run ball in corner.’

But Newcastle should have made sure of the points before that concession. Colback gave them a largely undeserved lead when he steered home low from 12 yards on 74 minutes and substitute Gabriel Obertan was sprung clear soon after. He, however, dithered in the area and the chance was gone. Ayoze Perez was equally wasteful when blazing over moments before Crouch’s leveller.

Carver bemoaned those misses but praised Colback, who, in his opinion, should not have been sent off.

‘Jack is a very competitive footballer and we won’t take that out of him. I thought the ref handled the game very well and, for me, it definitely was not a second yellow,’ he said.

‘I’ve told Jack he has to start scoring more and he showed good energy to get in box and get a good goal.

‘But it hadn’t been a classic game and won’t be going in my DVD collection. They can’t be exciting all of the time though. Sometimes you have to do what you can to win a game. Win 1-0, go home and everyone is happy. It is frustrating that we did not do that. We even had a couple of great opportunities after Jack’s goal.’

Earlier, Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic produced an instinctive stop to keep out Remy Cabella’s header and Krul pulled off an identical save at the other end to thwart Mame Biram Diouf.

But Carver was right, it had been a dour affair before the relative excitement of the final 15 minutes. In fact, Friend’s failure to send off Colback had given the contest a much-needed injection of incident and injustice – not that Hughes would agree with that assessment.
