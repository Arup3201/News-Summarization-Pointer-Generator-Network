Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is reportedly still trying to wean cash from a woman who paid his legal fees, despite her giving up on his case.

Mary Hamer, from Lake City, Florida, called herself van der Sloot's 'guardian angel' after shelling out around $100,000 towards legal costs.

But on Sunday, the divorced radiologist wrote a bizarre resignation letter saying she accepted defeat in the case, which found him guilty of murder.

Killer: Joran Van der Sloot was found guilty of murdering Stephany Flores in 2010 after she found out about his suspected involvement in another disappearance

Yet the 24-year-old killer, who admitted strangling Stephany Flores in May 2010, is still asking Hamer for cash, Radar Online reported.

The news site claims van der Sloot hopes to garner more money in order to avoid the 28-year-sentence given to him earlier this month.

He has 'been manipulating Hamer to give him more money to pay lawyer fees and pay off prison staff', a source said.

But it may be too late for van der Sloot, after Hamer turned her advocacy efforts towards Amir Hekmati, the Iranian-American sentenced to death in Iran earlier this month for allegedly being a spy for the CIA, this weekend.

'I will fight no more': Dr Mary Hamer, 55, paid legal fees for convicted killer Joran van der Sloot - but has written a letter saying she has 'resigned' from his case

Van der Sloot admitted
to strangling Flores after she found out about his suspected 
involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in 
2005.

Throughout the Peruvian case, Hamer had protested his innocence.

But
in a letter, addressed to President Obama, Peruvian president Ollanta 
Humala, the Flores family and Natalee Holloway's mother Beth, Hamer said
she finally 'accepts defeat'.

'The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle,' she wrote.

'I will fight no more': In the letter, Dr Mary Hamer says she has spent her life savings on legal fees for the case and received death threats

She
also voiced her fears the killer will die of a drug overdose or be 
murdered in jail, and that she will 'hold the Peruvian and US 
governments responsible if Mr. van der Sloot dies during his 28 year 
sentence'.

Dear President Obama, President Humala, Beth Holloway, the Flores family, the Media & Joran Van der Sloot:

I, Mary Hamer officially and formally am resigning from my spiritual 
and civil rights advocacy work on behalf of Joran van der Sloot.

The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle. I lose. I accept defeat.

I have fought fervently on behalf of Joran Van der Sloot with NO results. I have sacrificed my lifeâ€™s savings & I am now poor. I have risked death threats.

Joran did Not commit murder. Joran committed Manslaughter with Stephany Flores' provocation.

Joran had PTSD Diminished Mental Capacity & He was in a state of Self-Defense from years of a destroyed Self-esteem.

I will fight No more forever.

Thank you. Respectfully & Humbly, Mary Hamer, M.D. U.S.A.

She adds: 'I have sacrificed my life's savings and I am now poor. I have risked death threats.'

The
letter re-iterated her belief that van der Sloot did not kill Flores, 
rather he committed 'manslaughter with [her] provocation' after 
suffering from 'years of destroyed self esteem'.

Hamer had old Anderson Cooper in an 
interview this month she trusts van der Sloot and believes he is
innocent - and denied he is playing her.

She said: 'I still don't know who killed Stephany Flores. There are too many unanswered questions.'

The Dutch citizen met Stephany Flores, 21, in a casino in Lima in May 2010.

He took cash and credit cards from her before fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He
confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after
she found out about his suspected involvement in the Holloway case.

Ms Holloway, 18, from Mountain Brook, Birmingham, disappeared on Aruba in May 2005 during a high school graduation trip.

Van der Sloot was arrested over her disappearance, but never charged.

The killer has now appealed his 28-year sentence on the grounds police did not take his initial confession into account.

'Guardian angel': Van der Sloot had previously written to Hamer, who paid $100,000 towards his legal fees, asking for more funds and saying he loved her
