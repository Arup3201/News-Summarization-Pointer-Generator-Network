Prince Harry took some time out of his hectic tour of the United States yesterday to spend time in an English-style pub.

The Prince booked the whole of the The Golden Bee, near where he is staying in Colorado Springs for a briefing.

Despite being a private affair, Harry dressed smartly in a British Armed Forces navy polo shirt, blue chinos and a grey belt.

It was a home-from-home for the 
Prince, as the pub is modelled on a traditional English pub and has 
even had its interior decorations flown in from Britain to make it feel more 
authentic.

The pub was loaned for half an hour, while the Prince a briefed journalists about the Warrior Games - a sports tournament
 for injured servicemen and women.

But
 unlike his escapades in Las Vegas, which culminated in the Prince being
 snapped in the nude, the afternoon was perfectly civilised and Harry 
seemed relaxed when he left.

Popular: The well-known pub was booked on behalf of the Prince for the meeting

Tankard: The Prince appeared to pass a silver pint mug to an aide as he headed for the waiting car

Harry,
 who has himself recently returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan, 
spent time chatting to injured soldiers at the games, many of whom had lost limbs.

The Prince is known as Captain Harry Wales by his comrades and appeared to be wholly at ease among his fellow soldiers.

He
 even stayed for a game of sitting volleyball with members of the 
British Armed Forces team, as well as taking part in the opening 
ceremony for the games, where the torch was lit.

The Prince is involved in several charities which support injured service personnel.

Getting involved: Earlier in the day the Prince had played sitting volleyball with injured British soldiers taking part in the Warrior Games
