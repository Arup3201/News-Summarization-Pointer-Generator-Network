A husband murdered his wife and then killed himself after the couple were accused of abusing their baby - when she suffered from an undiagnosed, fatal genetic condition.

David O'Shell shot his wife Tiffany in the face while she slept before turning the gun on himself. The tragic murder-suicide happened the night before they were to meet with investigators who were looking into allegations that the couple had harmed their three-month-old daughter Alyssa.

Two weeks earlier, Alyssa had been taken from her parents after the child was found to have 11 fractures by doctors.

Tragic events: David O'Shell shot his wife Tiffany before killing himself at their home in Colorado after he was wrongly accused of abusing his daughter Alyssa who had a rare genetic condition

The couple's bodies were found on June 30, 2008 at their home in Lakewood, Colorado by Tiffany's father Paul when he could not reach them by telephone.

It was the same day that Dr Joyce Oleszek at Children's Hospital Colorado began to suspect that Alyssa was suffering from a rare disease and ordered genetic testing.

A week later, the fears were confirmed  - the baby was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a fatal condition in babies.

The condition meant that Alyssa was unable to develop muscles needed for sitting up, supporting her head or standing. It also meant her bones broke easily.

Alyssa died in her grandfather's arms on October 28 just a few months after her parents. 

The child's maternal grandparents Paul and Jackie
 Cuin spoke out about their family tragedy to raise awareness of their late granddaughter's genetic disorder.

They told the Denver Post about the despair the young couple, both police officers, had gone 
through when their baby was taken away by social services and placed 
with a foster family.

Mr Cuin told the Post: 'The last thing she [Tiffany] said to me was, ''Please help me save my husband and my family''... nobody would listen.'

He struggles to forgive his son-in-law for his actions. However Mrs Cuin told the Post: 'I get it. I understand. He loved her too much. He was going to lose his wife. His job. His military service. He
 was never going to get Alyssa back.'

The Cuins believe that Colorado social services were 'overzealous' when it came to the case.

Tiffany Cuin had studied at the University of Northern Colorado and originally planned to work with children who have special needs before deciding to become a police officer.

She worked with the Lakewood Police Department, where she met her future husband William David O'Shell.

The couple married and had their first baby - a daughter named Alyssa. Three months after she was born, Tiffany noticed that her daughter cried when she lifted her leg while changing her nappy.

The next day, Alyssa's leg appeared swollen so the couple took their baby to the doctor where an X-ray revealed a possible fracture.

At hospital, 11 fractures were found in the baby's legs, causing staff to call social services. Alyssa was taken away from her parents and placed in foster care while the entire family came under scrutiny as child abuse suspects.

Several people questioned the allegations, including several doctors who wanted a bone specialist to test Alyssa and a social worker who noted the lack of bruising or other external injuries. 

Torn apart: Tiffany and David O'Shell with their daughter Alyssa

The couple were only allowed a supervised visit for one hour with their newborn.

Mr O'Shell became the main suspect because he had once picked the baby up by her legs to kiss her belly. 

His mental state deteriorated as he heard he could face felony charges and be imprisoned, causing him to lose his job and his family.

On June 30, 2008 the couple missed an 
8am appointment with the hospital about their case and never showed up to 
meetings with their lawyers later in the day. They were later discovered
 dead at their home.

On the same day, Alyssa's foster mother 
brought her to the hospital because she was concerned about the 
baby's lack of development and difficulty breathing. 

After burying their daughter and 
son-in-law, the Cuins launched a legal battle and were finally given 
custody of their granddaughter in July.

They looked after Alyssa around the clock as her condition worsened.

After her death a few months later, a short obituary read: 'Alyssa, 7 months old, rejoined her parents on Oct. 28, 2008.'

Although
 the grandparents sued the child protection investigators, they lost the
 case after authorities argued that their actions had not been willfully
 or wantonly wrong.
