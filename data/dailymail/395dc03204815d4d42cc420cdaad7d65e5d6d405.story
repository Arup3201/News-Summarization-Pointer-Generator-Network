Clashing colours, mismatched patterns, dodgy paint jobs and cluttered corners are all on the list of cardinal sins when it comes to designing and decorating a lounge room.

Poor scaling and positioning of furniture, drawing attention to the wrong parts of the space and misguided attempts to make rooms look bigger are also some of the most common faux pas. 

Interior stylist and buyer from The Home Emma Bloomfield told Daily Mail Australia the worst living room she had ever come across was one that featured a checkered couch alongside a brown leather one, which both clashed with the Persian rug on the floor.

The Home are searching for Australia's Ugliest Living Room and interior stylist Emma Bloomfield said this one in NSW was the worst she had seen so far

The space in Queensland could be a certain contender for the ugliest room with its yellowed walls, cobwebs on the ceiling and a floor and lounge which don't look safe to sit on

This room in WA desperately needs a paint job matching furniture and a bigger TV unit that isn't dwarfed by the television

These brightly coloured and very old couches in a Victorian home also made it onto the terrible list

'Mismatched colours equals a confused style,' Ms Bloomfield said.

'Persian rugs and a country check fabric don’t go together. Stick to similar styles for the big ticket items to keep from confusing the style.'

She added a paint job on the wall wouldn't go astray and the rug - aside from clashing with almost everything else in the room - was much too small for the space.

In light of this, homewares and interior design website The Home has launched an effort to find the ugliest living room in the whole of Australia.

Shocking clashing patterns and couches without proper cushions seen here in a Victorian living room are a repeat offender

This room, also in Victoria, has an exposed brick wall which 'screams 1980s' according to Ms Bloomfield who said the room needed a paint job quick smart

In this tiled room in Victoria the couches clash with the textured tiles and the glass table is outdated

More messy than ugly this room in NSW would probably look a lot better with a tidy up above all else

In conjunction with Network Ten's Studio 10, they have asked homeowners to dob themselves - or their friends - in and the 'winner' of the competition will get their horrible lounge room replaced with a brand new one.

'Home may be where the heart is, but the living room is the soul of the home. It’s where you relax, rejuvenate and entertain, so you should have a living room you adore,' said Alexandra Mills, CEO of The Home. 

'I know there are many neglected living rooms out there in Australia, so we want to find the ugliest one and transform it from mess to mesmerising. 

'We also want to show how anyone can easily transform their own living rooms with a few updates and tweaks – it doesn’t have to be expensive!' Ms Mills added.

Also in NSW this living room is 'too matchy matchy' and needs another colour besides blue and yellow to break up the space according to Ms Bloomfield 

In Queensland this room needed to be broken up with pattern and texture otherwise you get a whitewash effect like this

This space in NSW needed one thing desperately - a paint job

This outdated living room - also in NSW- could do with some upgraded furniture and a little de-cluttering

Some features of some of the disaster rooms so far include strange and outdated patterns and prints, poor or completely forgotten paint jobs, too many items cluttered in to one room or not enough furniture spread around an area with too much space.

Queensland presented a strong contestant for the worst room, with yellowed walls, cobwebs and cracks on the ceiling and a floor and lounge which don't look safe to sit on.

The television looks as though it could have been one of the first ever made, and the curtains are straight out of the 1970s.  

In one of the terrible rooms from NSW, Ms Bloomfied said the colour scheme was way off and the owner needed to introduce some more neutral colours to break the room up.

This Victoria lounge room was described as 'confused' and a poor example of a multi-functional living space

The small table over a patterned mat covering the floor which matches the couch makes this room a contender for the ugliest room

The cluttered corner behind the TV make the space feel smaller than it is, plus the tissues near the heater present a serious fire risk

This mismatched furniture crowded around a television in Queensland put this space in the running for the ugliest in Australia

'Too matchy matchy. This room only has two colours, blue and orange. It's fine to try and match up some of your furniture but add in a few other splashes of colour to break it up,' she said.

For another sparse looking situation also in NSW, the interior stylist had just one tip: 'Don't forget the most important thing - paint!'

Queensland also had some horrors to offer in the form of  a disparate lounge room with only one colour tone and a whole lot of space.

Ms Bloomfield had this to say: 'Throw rugs add colour and texture to a room but not if they are covering your dated recliner chairs. Also, don't forget a rug, especially on tiles - winter without a rug looks like a cold one!' 

Missing tiles and clashing furnishing make this living space in Western Australia look confused

This room is on report for its couches that match the strange textured floor

Another offender in the bland colour scheme department in Queensland was too much neutral and not enough of anything else.

'Solid blocks of neutral colour like this need to be broken up with pattern and texture: add in some cushions, a floor rug and some artwork to add interest and personality to the space,' Ms Bloomfield suggested.

For a room in NSW clutter was the key concern, and possibly an unwanted house fire. 

'For easy viewing pleasure you should aim to keep the wall the TV is on free, don't confuse the situation by sticking photos on the wall above. Also, keep fire hazards to a minimum by storing all your junk and consider moving the tissue box away from the heater!' said Ms Bloomfield.
