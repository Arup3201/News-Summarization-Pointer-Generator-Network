An eight-year-old boy was saved from a deadly bee attack by his pit bull dog who dragged him to safety to prevent him from being stung further.

Jesse-Cole Shaver, 8, from Oregon, was out with 10 neighbourhood friends in a local wood, exploring a creek, when someone stepped on a rotten log unleashing a swarm of bees.

The terrified children were down a steep embankment behind their apartment building in Oregon City when the deadly bees filled the air, stinging little Jesse-Cole at least 24 times.

Rescue: Luckily pit bull Hades came to the rescue dragging Jesse-Cole back up the hill to safety after he was unable to climb by himself

The attack left the boy unable to climb back up the hill to safety.

But luckily his pit bull Hades came to the rescue.

‘Hades saw me and came and she dragged me up to the grass and then stopped and let me crawl on her back and then took me to mom,’ Jesse- told KPTV in Oregon.

His frightened mom, who does not want to be named, said: ‘I just heard a bunch of screaming, then I saw my dog dragging my son up by his pants.’ 

Meanwhile, his big sister was also stung five times in what could have been a deadly attack because she's allergic to bees.

Hugs: Jesse-Cole could not wait to leave hospital and hug his dog to say thank-you

She had to be given two injections from an EpiPen to prevent her body from swelling in reaction to the stings.

‘It
 felt like a bunch of needles went into my skin, and I didn't know what 
was going on until the girl started yelling, 'Bees!' Jasmine said.

Today, the family say they are incredibly grateful for their dog’s quick thinking actions.

Jesse-Cole and his sister were taken to Willamette Falls Hospital where doctors were still battling to remove even more deadly bees from the children’s hair, according to their mom.

And she fears that it could have been much worst if it weren’t for their dog’s life saving actions.

‘A couple of these kids could have got really sick or died, I'm sure of it,’ she said.

Brave Hades was also stung several times during the attack - but everyone is now fine.

His proud owner Jesse-Cole could not wait to leave hospital and give him a big hug to thank him, his mom said.

The children said that they have no plans to return to the trail behind their apartment building.
