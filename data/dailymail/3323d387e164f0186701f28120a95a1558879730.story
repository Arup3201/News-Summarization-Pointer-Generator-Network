A Brazilian bomb squad blew up a suspicious bag near a metro station entrance close to the Maracana as Germany and France played their World Cup quarter-final on Friday.

A number of Associated Press journalists saw the controlled explosion take place, with the metro station closed as a precaution.

The Federal Police said it investigated a bomb threat near the stadium but that no explosive device was found.

A few people were near the metro station when the bomb squad acted, as tens of thousands of fans were inside the Maracana watching the quarter-final.

Some surrounding roads were also closed while the bomb squad investigated.

The incident lasted about 20 minutes.

The metro was reopened after the bag was detonated, before the World Cup match had finished.
