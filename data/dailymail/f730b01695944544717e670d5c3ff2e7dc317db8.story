This is the horrifying moment a lorry driver is forced to swerve out of the way as a drunk female care assistant drives the wrong way up the M5.

Katy Homer, 26, joined the southbound carriageway at junction two for Oldbury and drove her Vauxhall Astra north along the hard shoulder for four miles before exiting at West Bromwich.

Footage of the incident shows oncoming drivers flashing their headlights and moving out of the way.

A lorry driver is forced to swerve out of her way after drunk Katy Homer joined the southbound carriageway and started heading north

Footage of the incident shows oncoming drivers flashing their headlights and moving out of the way.

At Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday she plead guilty to charges of driving with excess alcohol and dangerous driving.

The court heard the shocked officers were 
dealing with a different traffic incident when they spotted Homer 
leaving the motorway up the entry slip road at 2.30am on December 4 2013.

They pursued her and watched as she circled the roundabout twice before stopping the car.

Homer was recorded as having 79 
microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - more than twice 
the legal limit which is 35mcg.

She was given an interim 
disqualification from driving at Thursday’s hearing and released on bail
 until her a sentencing hearing on March 28.

Judge John Warner said: 'I am sure you 
are aware driving the wrong way on the motorway when over twice the 
limit is a very serious matter.'

Malcolm Fowler, defending, said the care worker had not been sacked from her job.

He added: 'It is a grave allegation.

'I did touch upon medical history, there is a serious condition of depression for this lady who is on medication.

'She is still in employment despite her condition.'

After the hearing, Inspector Dave Southam, from Sandwell Police Investigation Team, said: 'There is no doubt how serious this incident could have been.

'Ms
 Homer drove the wrong way along the M5 for around four miles and CCTV 
footage from the time shows other vehicles having to move out of the 
way.

'Thankfully, due to the 
time of day, the motorway was not as busy as it otherwise might have 
been and so no significant harm was caused to others.

'Ultimately
 driving whilst under the influence poses a risk to both the driver and 
others on the road - regardless of whether it is on a motorway or a 
quiet side street and this case will hopefully serve as a warning to 
others who make the dangerous mistake of getting behind the wheel after 
they’ve had a drink.'
