Canada has made a claim on the North Pole in an effort to assert its sovereignty in the resource-rich Arctic.

The country last week applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic 
Ocean, including  extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles (1.7 million sq km).

Canada filed the preliminary submission last week based on rules laid out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which regulates international law for the oceans.

Currently, under international law, 
Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the U.S. - the five countries with 
territories near the Arctic Circle - are allotted 200 nautical miles 
from their northern coasts. 

However,
 under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, exclusive claims can be 
vastly expanded for Arctic nations that prove that their part of the 
continental shelf extends beyond that zone.

Canada has applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic 
Ocean, including  extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 miles (1.7 million sq km). 

This is roughly the size of Alberta and the Saskatchewan region combined.

If successful, the country will have rights to the polar region's resources, which is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 15 per cent of oil. 

While Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, John Baird announced that the country’s final claim would include the North Pole, he added scientific evidence to back the claim isn't yet ready.

‘For whatever reason, the scientists and the aircraft stopped the research when they got to the Pole,’ Professor Robert Huebert, an Arctic expert at the University of Calgary told MailOnline. 

‘The science couldn’t have been too hard, because they were able to get up to the Pole. But no one has given me a satisfactory answer as to why they stopped.’

‘It may just have been a simple mistake,’ he added.

Professor Huebert said further studies
 will depend on the availability of researchers, ice breakers and 
scientific equipment, but at a push, it could be completed in a year. 

Canada’s
 decision to continue the work puts it head-to-head with Russia, along 
with potential negotiations with Denmark and the U.S., as all have 
expressed interest in the Pole.

Asserting Canada's rights in the 
Arctic has been a popular domestic issue for Prime Minister Stephen 
Harper, though at least one expert on the issue described the planned 
claim as a long shot. 

Currently, under international law, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the U.S. - the five countries with territories near the Arctic Circle - are allotted 200 nautical miles from their northern coasts. The different regions are shown on this map

‘We 
are determined to ensure that all Canadians benefit from the tremendous 
resources that are to be found in Canada's far north,’ Mr Baird said. 

Canada's
 submission last week set out the potential outer limits of the 
country's continental shelf in the Atlantic - a claim of 656,373 miles 
(roughly 1.7 million sq km).

Canada's follow-up submission will 
include a claim to the Lomonosov Ridge, an undersea mountain range 
between Ellesmere Island, Canada's most northern land mass, and Russia's
 east Siberian coast.

That claim would extend Canada's claim 200 nautical miles beyond the North Pole. 

The submission that Canada filed with 
the UN is essentially a series of undersea co-ordinates that map what 
the government claims is the country's extended continental shelf. 

Mr Baird said it's a mammoth task, and
 the government needs more time to complete the mapping in the Arctic, 
and to get its UN submission right. 

Following the claims made by Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, John Baird, Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to increase its focus on the Arctic.

Speaking to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin praised the military's work in the Arctic and said it intended to finish plans by the end of the year to upgrade military bases in the resource-rich region where world powers jostle for control.

As well as Canada, the U.S., Denmark and Norway are also pressing for control of what they consider their fair share of massive untapped oil and natural gas reserves.

'I request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the Arctic,' Putin said, speaking at a Defence Ministry board meeting.

'By the end of the year it is planned - and I expect it will be done... the renewal of the Tiksi airfield and completion of construction work on the Severomorsk-1 airfield,' he said in televised comments.

Russia has already completed work on renovating an airfield on the Novosibirsk Islands, which was abandoned in 1993.

Earlier this year Moscow sent 10 warships and four icebreakers to the islands in a show of force.

Underscoring Moscow's sensitivity over Arctic claims, Russia arrested 30 people on board a Greenpeace ship during a September protest against Russian offshore Arctic drilling. They now face charges carrying seven year jail sentences.

Putin said earlier this week that Russia's military presence in the Arctic was needed to protect against potential threats from the United States.

The world's largest oil producer, Russia expects to see oil output decline at its mainstay western Siberian oilfields in coming years and has looked further afield to potential Arctic reserves.

Russia, Canada and Denmark all say an underwater mountain range known as the Lomonosov Ridge, which stretches 1,800 km (1,120 miles) across the pole under the Arctic Sea, is part of their own landmass.

‘That's why we have asked our 
officials and scientists to do additional and necessary work to ensure 
that a submission for the full extent of the Continental Shelf in the 
Arctic includes Canada's claim to the North Pole,’ he said.

The UN submission is also 
political, said Michael Byers, an expert on Arctic and international law
 at the University of British Columbia.

‘(Harper) does not want to be the 
prime minister seen publicly as having surrendered the North Pole, even 
if the scientific facts don't support a Canadian claim,’ Professor Byers
 said. 

‘What he's essentially doing here is 
holding this place, standing up for Canadian sovereignty, while in 
private he knows full well that position is untenable.’

If Canada's claim is successful, the country will have rights to the polar region's resources, which is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 15 per cent of oil. The area is highly political and Russia, in particular, has recently been looking further afield to these potential Arctic reserves

The UN submissions do not lead to a binding decision, but lay the groundwork for future country-to-country negotiations over competing territorial claims in the Arctic that could take years to resolve. 

Mr Byers said there isn't any particular rush for Canada to stake its claim for the North Pole, pointing out that such claims cover some of the most remote and harshest places on the planet, and commercial exploitation of resources is a long way off. 

‘We're talking about the centre of a large, inhospitable ocean that is in total darkness for three months each year, thousands of miles from any port," he said. 

‘The water in the North Pole is 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) deep and will always be covered by sea ice in the winter. It's not a place where anyone is going to be drilling for oil and gas. 

President Vladimir Putin has also ordered Russia's military to increase its focus on the Arctic and finish plans by the end of the year to upgrade military bases in the resource-rich region where world powers jostle for control.

‘I request that you pay special attention to the deployment of infrastructure and military units in the Arctic,’ Putin said, speaking at a Defence Ministry board meeting last year.

Putin said earlier this week that Russia's military presence in the Arctic was needed to protect against potential threats from the United States.
