Football ace, model, style icon, 
father-of-four, multi-millionaire: David Beckham has quite an impressive
CV for someone who hasn't even reached 40.

And
his success (and half-naked modelling gigs) show no sign of abating 
judging by this first look at his latest H&M underwear campaign.

The images, unveiled today by high-street store H&M, shows the 38-year-old doing what he does best: posing in pants.

Doing what he does best: The official David Beckham for H&M campaign images have been unveiled and they don't disappoint

In a new ad for the Bodywear brand, 
Beckham showcases the range in his own inimitable way – with a 
range of brooding looks into the middle distance.

Posing in a changing room, the football ace showcases his new collection of briefs and loungewear in a series of sexy images including a few topless ones, much to the delight of his female fans.

East end: The campaign has been designed to have an east London feel, which Beckham says takes him back to his roots

There is a heritage sportswear feel to 
the new David Beckham Bodywear pieces this autumn and the campaign has been created to evoke an old East London atmosphere.

The collection includes raglan-sleeve jerseys and henleys 
in athletic greys, alongside grey vests and a three-pack of grey trunks.

There's also casual pyjamas, loungewear and nightwear and this 
autumn there are ribbed pyjama bottoms, as well as drawstring jersey 
shorts and trousers.

The latest campaign marks the latest stage in David Beckham’s 
long-term collaboration with H&M.

Speaking of his latest collection, 
Leytonstone born Beckham said: 'I love the heritage athletic style of 
the new pieces in my Bodywear collection at H&M.

'The vests, pajama 
pants and raglan sleeve tops are already like wardrobe favorites for me 
that I know I’ll wear all season long.'

It was great to shoot them in an old-fashioned East End changing room. It was like I had gone right back to my roots.’

The
former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy star was 
previously seen showing off his pants –and his impressively toned 
physique – in a memorable H&M ad directed by British film-maker Guy 
Richie.
