Two tonnes of contaminated meat may have been making its way into the food chain every day from an illegal food processing plant, it has been revealed.

Caterers were urged to destroy any meat bought from West Yorkshire Lamb, Beef and Poultry Ltd in Bradford, West Yorkshire, last month after it was raided by the Food Standards Agency, Bradford Council environmental health officers and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.

Seized poultry was condemned and an Emergency Prohibition Notice was served for the premises to remain closed until it met legal hygiene requirements.

Images of the seized meat show hundreds of pieces of chicken stacked in boxes and crates at the site.

The meat appears to have been wrapped in blue plastic before being packed up in the cardboard boxes and plastic crates.

Pieces of meat can also be seen on the floor of the factory, whose owner is still at large.

Five suspected illegal workers were arrested after they were discovered by immigration officers, leaving the business facing a £50,000 fine.

A 19-year-old Pakistani man has been removed from the country. The others remain in detention while steps are taken to remove them from the country, a Home Office spokesman said.

Ian Bairstow, Bradford Council's Strategic Director for Environment, Sport and Sustainability, said: 'Two tonnes of poultry was seized and destroyed before it got into the food chain.

Poultry seized from the site was condemned and an Emergency Prohibition Notice was served for the premises to remain closed until it met legal hygiene requirements

'The company was operating from Monday to Friday so we estimate that it was supplying this amount each day.

'Investigations
are continuing to identify and locate the operator of the business to 
discover the full extent of its operations.

'None of the meat previously sold from the factory was returned to the council.'
