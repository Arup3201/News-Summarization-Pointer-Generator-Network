World-renowned forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd has backed the NSW coroner in finding rock star Michael Hutchence committed suicide.

Dr Shepherd recreated the last hours of Hutchence's death and conducted a review of the findings of NSW coroner Derrick Hand for the Seven Network documentary, The Last Days Of Michael Hutchence, which aired on Sunday.

Mr Hand ruled out links with auto-eroticism in the death of the 37-year-old INXS lead singer he was found hanged at Sydney's Carlton Ritz Hotel in 1997.

His blood contained both Prozac and cocaine at the time he died.

The finding was disputed by Hutchence's then partner Paula Yates, who died in 2000 from a heroin overdose, who wanted to have the coroner's finding overturned.

'In no way do I accept the coroner's verdict of suicide,' she told the Nine Network's 60 Minutes program in an interview in 1998.

'I will be making it abundantly clear that because of information that I and only I could know about Michael ... I cannot accept the verdict.

'And I won't have my child grow up thinking that her father left her, not knowing the way he loved her.'

Dr Shepherd told AAP that Hand had arrived at the most logical conclusion and other than Hutchence's well known sexual appetite, there was nothing to suggest he died of auto-eroticism.

'There is nothing I can put my finger on to say this is a sexual thing and there were significant absences of evidence, like soft ligature and pornography,' Dr Shepherd said.

'There is nothing in Michael's case, other than his known sexual activities, which were extensive and frequent as far as I can gather, and that's the only thing that points it in that direction.'

Dr Shepherd's documentary into Hutchence's death aired on Sunday and it follows his TV post-mortems on celebrities Michael Jackson, Anna Nicole Smith and Whitney Houston.

His expertise was called on for the inquest into the deaths of Princess Diana and UK TV presenter Jill Dando and for the aftermath of the September 11 and Bali Bombing attacks.

With the help of NSW Coroner Derrick Hand, who presided over the original report into Hutchence's death, Dr Shepherd was able to create a detailed reconstruction inside the hotel room where the rocker was found

His death was reported by the NSW Coroner to be the result of suicide. The moment he was found in his hotel door with a belt around his neck was reenacted for the documentary

The events leading up to Hutchence's death were charted in the documentary using toxicology reports not previously seen before

Dr Shepherd obtained the toxicology report that was compiled after Hutchence's sudden death and spoke with Mr Hand who has since retired.

The UK specialist said Hutchence was under immense stress on several levels and the psychological post-mortem says a lot about the INXS singer's state of mind at the time of his death.

At the top of Hutchence's issues was the battle for his only daughter, Tiger Lily, to accompany Yates to Australia.

Dr Shepherd said the toxicology report showed there was a mixture of cocaine, alcohol and the anti-depressant Prozac in his blood when he died

Dr Shepherd said his use of Prozac was erratic and led to increased use of other drugs in the years prior to his death

Dr Shepherd said when you couple stress with the issues Hutchence was confronting, then Mr Hand's finding were much clearer.

'Can I entirely scotch every rumour, 99 per cent of them I can, but there is a little gap,' Dr Shepherd said.

'There's all sorts of psychology that go around these hanging related deaths.

'You look at what was happening in his life, the events around him, what was going on with the INXS tour, his private life and with Tiger Lily, Bob Geldof and Paula Yates.

'He hit a low point on his own in that room that night.'

The Last Autopsy of Michael Hutchence was one of the most watched shows in Australia on Sunday.

A coroner said Hutchence's death was the result of suicide, but girlfriend and mother of his daughter Tiger Lily, Paula Yates, publicly insisted he had died accidentally during a sex game gone wrong
