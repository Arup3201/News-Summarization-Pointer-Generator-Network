A notorious Parisian wife-swapping club said to be a favourite haunt of disgraced ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn faces closure for allegedly allowing prostitutes to operate on its premises.

Les Chandelles has been shut down temporarily and police have placed three people under investigation on suspicion of 'highly organised pimping'.

One of the accused is former professional footballer Alim Ben Mabrouk, 51, who played for Algeria at the 1986 World Cup.

Les Chandelles - which translates as The Candles - is located adjacent to the Louvre on Paris' elegant L'Avenue de l'Op√©ra.

It is regarded as the most exclusive of the French capital's 50 swingers' clubs and members are reputed to include Strauss-Kahn, celebrities and several politicians.

Admittance is only granted to the wealthy, famous or extremely good-looking.

But detectives believe the club is frequented by high-class prostitutes and have shut it down until further notice.

Paris police chief now has 24 hours to decide if Les Chandelles can open for its annual New Year's Eve celebration.

The venue's owner, Valerie Hervo, 44, has been questioned by police but has not been charged.

Known as Madame Valerie, she said: 'I have nothing to say, only that my establishment has nothing to do with this affair.'

Les Chandelles comprises a five-star restaurant and a bar and is entered through an unmarked door.

It plays host to risque dancers and the chance to swap partners or indulge in group sex in lounge and private rooms.

Strauss-Kahn, 62, led the International Monetary Fund as managing director for four years until a sex scandal involving a New York hotel maid broke earlier this year.

He had been expected to be voted France's next president in the 2012 election.

But he resigned in May after his shock arrest in New York on criminal charges of sexual assault and attempted rape involving Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel main at Manhattan's Sofitel.

The case was dropped by the District Attorney's office, amid concerns about the credibility of Ms Diallo, who later filed a civil suit against him.

Returning to France in September, he apologised for what he called an 'inappropriate relationship' with Ms Diallo, which he said was consensual.

He was cleared the following month of sexually assaulting French writer Tristane Banon because of the statute of limitations in France, which is three years for the crime.
