A farmer who raised his three children on raw milk despite it being outlawed in Australia has spoken out in defence of the controversial product after a child's death was blamed on unpasteurised milk.

Mark Tyler, who has drunk raw milk from his family's dairy farm all his life, called the decision made by Victoria's Department of Health to issue a public health warning against raw milk after the death of a three-year-old  and serious illness of four others was blamed on the product, a 'beat up'.

'So far there is no proof of the bacteria being found in the milk… one child dies and four are sick but the headlines say it's from different brands, so it's not even a case of food poisoning… it's one child out of thousands getting sick,' Mr Tyler told Daily Mail Australia.

Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can still sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food.

It can be found labelled under 'bath milk' in health food stores around the country.

Mr Tyler said the Department of Health's warning was part of a 'big push to try and get rid of bath milk'.

Across Australia people are legally obtaining raw milk for drinking via herd shares which allow people to buy a share in a cow and then pay a farmer to board and milk the animal.

They then receive the milk from 'their own cow', thus it is not being illegally sold.

Mr Tyler runs a herd share programme at his Moo View Dairy farm in Willunga Hill, SA and said he has people from all walks of life investing in his cows so they can get unpasteurised milk.

'There are professional sportsmen, university professors, doctors - you name it, every profession from tradespeople to other farmers,' he said.

Former AFL player Jason Porplyzia openly supports the production of raw cow's milk. The Adelaide Crows star, who retired in October, part owns a cow at Moo View Diary which means he can drink his own unpasteurised milk direct from the farm.

Mr Tyler won a landmark District Court Ruling in February – after his farm was raided in May 2013 - that means he can continue to supply unpasteurised milk to people who have a share in his herd.

People pay $30 for a share in the cows and for $4 a week they are entitled to about 1.5 litres of milk.

Porplyzia spoke about his decision to drink raw milk instead of protein powders post workout last year. 

'I use it after weights sessions, I know a lot of the other boys get stuck into their protein powders ... but I decided that sort of thing wasn't for me,' he said.

'I don't mean to boast but I do pretty well in the gym and I think part of that is due to consuming raw milk.

'I also like the fact that I know where the milk is coming from.'

Mr Tyler, who started his cowshare programme in 2008, believes the government banned unpasteurised milk as a way to control the dairy market and to support 'big business'.

Some of the comments on the Facebook group that supports raw milk show how passionate people are about the illegal product

'The more you look into it the more you realise how little facts there are about raw milk and there are problems with pasteurised milk.

'I think most of this is big business wanting to control what consumers have access to… it's good for supermarkets and long shelf-lives but the more you look the more you see people having health issues with pasteurised milk.'

Mr Tyler is confident that raw milk is safe if produced in the right way.

'I've drunk raw milk all my life, I always lived on this farm. I drunk it here and certainly our children have grown up on it

'Our parents used to sell it and the locals used to come but then the government banned that,' Mr Tyler explained.

In recent years the dairy farmer has noticed a surge in demand for raw milk as part of the raw food movement. 

Advocates claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms.

'There's a much greater interest in food and where it comes from… I think that's anti-processed food in general but probably leading that is raw milk.'

Many people who drink unpasteurised milk believe that pasteurised milk is unhealthy

Mr Tyler says he limits the risk of harmful bacteria – such as E.coli - associated with unpasteurised milk and that pasteurising laws put in place 70-years-ago are now outdated.

'We've got a very modern milking machine – the dangers that were there when pasteurising came in is a world apart from modern dairy equipment,' he said.

Milk isn't squeezed into buckets surrounded by flies with 'cows flicking manure everywhere' anymore, he said, so 'the situation is so different.'

He also believes the pasteurisation process has some issues. 

'There are modern factors in commercial dairy farms that need to be avoided, like the massive 700 cow diaries where there is lots more mud, so many cows bogging up around the troughs and a lot more bacteria.

'The feeds that are potential carriers of bacteria… a lot of big farms will have feed chopped up and a dead rat will get in it… where as if they just eat grass and hay and grain without anything foreign that limits the sources of bacteria.'

Mr Tyler's views are directly at odds to those of the Department of Health.

Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Rosemary Lester said that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea.

'Only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' she said.

Dr Lester noted that bath milk packaging is very similar to that of drinking milk, and the products could be easily confused.

She explained the pathogens in raw milk can make anyone sick but risks are greatest for young children, elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people.

'Since the 1940s it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said.

Food Safety Information Council spokesperson Lydia Buchtmann told Daily Mail Australia that in pasteurised milk 'the heat treatment kills any bacteria in the milk making it a very safe product that is very unusual to have any food poisoning from.'

She explained it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption. 'There are a few raw cheeses that have been approved but they have to go through rigorous testing'.

She argued: 'However cleanly you are milking your cow, bacteria will get in because cows are animals… it will be contaminated from the faeces which can cause E.coli - a major cause of 4.1 million cases of food poisoning each year.'

Ms Buchtmann said children are at a particular risk from raw milk because their immune system hasn't fully developed yet.

'A child can be healthy and food poisoning can still be very serious… our advice is don't consume it is a health risk.' 

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has also urged Queenslanders not to drink raw milk 'as it is unfit for human consumption'.

Dr Young said the raw milk was sold in Australia as a cosmetic product, usually as ‘bath milk’.

'As bath milk is not for human consumption it is not a food and therefore not bound by the labelling requirements of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code,' Dr Young said.

'I have previously issued warnings about consuming this product, and it has been proven that the risks are substantial,' Dr Young said. 

The child's death will appear in front of the State Coroner.
