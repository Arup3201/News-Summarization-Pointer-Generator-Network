The Pope has confirmed he will visit both New York and Washington DC as part of a trip to the U.S. later this year.

The Vatican had previously announced that the Pontiff would visit Philadelphia to participate in a massive rally for Catholic families in September.

But speaking to reporters on a plane returning to Rome at the end of a trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines yesterday, Francis said he would be visiting the two cities for the first time since becoming head of the Roman Catholic Church.

The itinerary for the trip is yet to be finalised but it is expected that he could visit the White House and address Congress as well as speak at the United Nations in New York.

It is also believed he could give a mass in Madison Square Garden and visit Ground Zero.

However, it has been confirmed that when in the U.S. capital he will take part in a ceremony to cannonise Junipero Serra, an 18th century Spanish Franciscan priest.

There had been speculation that the Pope could have included a stop in California as part of his U.S. visit, especially as Serra founded missions in the state.

But the 79-year-old said: 'I would like to go to California for the canonisation of Junipero, but I think there is the problem of time. It requires two more days.'

He then said that the sainthood ceremony would take place at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception instead.

Serra was born on the Spanish island of Majorca in 1713, went to the Americas in the middle of the 18th century and led one of the first Franciscan missions in California.

He arrived in San Diego in 1769 and spent most of the rest of his life there before dying at a mission in Carmel near Monterey in 1784.

Meanwhile the city of Philadelphia has already begun preparations for the Pontiff's visit in September, which will coincide at the end of the week long World Meeting of Families.

There had been speculation that Pope Francis was set to visit California but he told journalists on the flight that there wouldn't be enough time 

It is expected that 1.5 million people could turn out for an open air Mass on the steps of the city's main art museum and that the crowd could fill a one-and-a-half mile stretch of parkway along the Schuylkill River.

Francis also disclosed proposed trips to Africa, in particular the Central African Republic and Uganda, which would most likely take place at the end of 2015 to avoid the rainy seasons.

There are also plans to visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile, most likely in July.

He also confirmed he hoped to visit Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in 2016 — and Peru at some point.

The announcement of his travel plans comes after the pope addressed a record six million Catholics in Manila on Sunday as his Asian pilgrimage drew to a close.

On the flight back to the Vatican, he also spoke of how Catholics 'shouldn't breed like rabbits' and should instead practice 'responsible parenting'.

While firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception, Francis said there are plenty of church-approved ways to regulate births.

But he said most importantly, no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size, blasting what he called the 'ideological colonization' of the developing world.

African bishops, in particular, have long complained about how progressive Western ideas about birth control and gay rights are increasingly being imposed on the developing world by groups, institutions or individual nations, often as a condition for development aid.

He said: 'Every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized.'

The Pope's comments, taken together with his defence of the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception during the trip, could be a signal that a more conservative side to the pope is emerging.
