Victim: Megan Bratten, a single mother of five, confronted a car thief after her van was stolen

A Missouri mother of five confronted a thief with text messages after her van was stolen — and the criminal returned her car just hours later.

Single mom Megan Bratten was at a Kmart in Independence, a suburb of Kansas City, when she walked out to find an empty parking spot where she had parked her van —  the vehicle she uses to run her business and provide for her family.

Desperate, she did the first thing that came to mind: She began to text message the cell phone she'd left in the car.

'Hey, you just stole a 
single mother of five's work van,' she wrote, KCTV reported. 'You are ruining my life here.'

She continued sending the messages for the next three hours, her pleas getting more desperate with each one.

'OMG car 
thief people can you just give me my van back!' she wrote, according to 
KCTV. 'It would be epic, the miracle I need right now.'

Finally, the thief sent her a message back.

'I do feel bad,' the message read, according to KCTV. 'My kids needed a meal on
 the table so that's what their dad did got them food. I know its wrong 
but it's been so hard since I lost my job.'

'I do feel bad:' The thief eventually replied to Bratten's messages, saying, 'My kids needed a meal on the table so that's what their dad did got them food. I know its wrong but it's been so hard since I lost my job'

The thief included detailed instructions on where the van was. Bratten couldn't believe her luck. She rushed to the marked spot with her mother and dog and found the car parked.

To her surprise, the thief even topped off her transmission fluid.

Bratten never called the police.

'I
 can really relate on the human level of the struggle of feeling 
desperate and making poor choices,' she told KCTV. 'I can understand how
 people act out of fear making poor choices.

'What matters in the end, he really did the right thing.'
