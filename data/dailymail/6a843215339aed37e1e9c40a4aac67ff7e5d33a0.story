An Oscar-nominated film will still be released in the UK today despite its disturbing similarities to the Alps air disaster - to the disgust of cinema-goers near to the home of one of the three British victims.

Argentinian film Wild Tales features a mass killer who locks himself in the cockpit of a passenger jet and crashes it in to the ground to murder everyone on board.

In terrifying scenes the fictional passengers panic and one tries to smash his way through a door to get to the controls in chillingly similar circumstances to the ill-fated Germanwings Airbus A320 flight. 

The fictional killer invites his enemies on to the flight, including a lover who jilted him and a colleague who was hard on him at work, so he can kill them.

Despite protests the highly-acclaimed movie will be shown in British cinemas from today, however, it was released in Spain and Germany last year although it is not known if Andreas Lubitz had seen it.

Similarities: Fans have raised questions over the release of Argentinian film Wild Tales, which features a mass killer who crashes a plane, centre, into the ground

Terror: One of the passengers tries to smash his way through the plane's cockpit door after it was locked from the inside - just like what prosecutors believe Andreas Lubitz had done

Terror: The passengers, which includes the killer's former girlfriend and boss, panic as they realise the plane is going down

On Tuesday he locked the captain out of the Airbus A320's cockpit  before setting the airliner's controls to descend into a rocky valley, obliterating the plane and killing all 150  on board. 

Reports in Germany this morning suggest the locked-out pilot may have resorted to using an axe in a desperate bid to get through the armoured door as the plane hurtled towards the ground. Prosecutors said the screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds.

Lubitz was said to have been depressed for years, which he may have kept secret from his employers, and may have had a breakdown before crashing his plane from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.

Movie fans say what happened  with the Germanwings plane has terrifying similarities with the Wild Tales movie, and have asked whether it should be pulled off the big screen.

It is a set of six short stories, meant to be black comedies, but the first 15-minute section where a pilot crashes a plane to kill everyone on board has taken on a new meaning.

In it two passengers on board chat and discover they know a man named Pasternak - a woman who used to be his lover and a former colleague who was tough on him at work.

It then emerges that everyone on the flight is connected to him and the trapped passengers then try to break in to the cockpit as the plane hurtles downwards. 

Pasternak crashes the plane into his parents' house, to kill them, himself and everyone on board.

Twitter users had noted the similarities between the film, and the horrific events of Tuesday.

Sarp Yelkencioğlu ‏wrote: 'The similarities between the #GermanWings crash & the scene in Damian Szifron's movie, 'Wild Tales' is mind boggling!' 

Andrea Newell tweeted: 'An awful morbid coincidence...the first story of the film 'Wild Tales' and the Germanwings aircraft crash. So sad'.

Steve Summers ‏wrote: 'I wonder if the Oscar nominated 'Wild Tales' will be pulled from UK cinemas given the sad unfolding events in the #Germanwings tragedy'. 

But it was cinema-goers in Birmingham - only half an hour away from Wolverhampton, where Martyn Matthews, one of the three British victims, lived with his family - who were left disgusted with the decision to go ahead with the release.

Receptionist Josie Callow, 28, from Birmingham, said: 'You would think there would be common sense and they could delay it for the sake of the families and people affected by the shock of such a tragic accident.

'But they probably care about making money from the release and people would have already booked to see it so that is much more important to people than bereaved family's feelings.'

Her words were echoed by Abdul Rajid, 33, a cleaner from Smethwick, West Midlands. 

'I heard about it and think it is disgusting if anyone goes to see it after the crash,' he told MailOnline.

'The fact that it mirrors it so closely means they surely should have waited just a little bit before releasing it here because even though it isn't on purpose, it is going to get criticised for not being sensitive at all.' 

Retired teacher Jeff Baxter, 67, from Birmingham, added: 'To release it in the UK so close to the incident when a few people from this country died is very insensitive. 

'Surely they could have delayed it for a few days or even weeks and then no-one would have noticed?'

But student Thomas Harris, 23, who is originally from Surrey, was more cynical. 

'Maybe they haven't changed the release date because the publicity helps, they say there is no such thing as bad press,' he said.

'But I do think it is very distasteful, especially to the families involved, it isn't something you want to be seeing advertised at such a horrible time personally.'

But distributor Artificial Eye told MailOnline it will still be shown in a number of cinemas across Britain from today. It is already out in the United States.
