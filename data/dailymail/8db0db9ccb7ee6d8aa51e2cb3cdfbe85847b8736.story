A college graduate celebrating her wife's birthday at a San Francisco club has been shot dead by a man who backed into her car.

Melquiesha Warren, who was just days from her 24th birthday, had been sitting in a car with a friend when an unknown assailant hit their car and then fired at the women at about 2am on Sunday.

Ms Warren, who had been standing in front of the car to check for damage, was shot in the head and her friend was seriously injured when a bullet hit her in the side.

'I'm just flabbergasted. It was just an 
accident. She lost 
her life. An innocent life was taken over an accident,' Ms Warren's wife, Tiffany Renee, told San Francisco Gate.

The couple had been celebrating at Club OMG in San Francisco with their 21-year-old friend Danisha Bean.

Aspirations: Melquiesha had just graduated with a degree in criminal justice

The group were in Miss Bean's car in the parking lot at about 2am when a vehicle with two people in it backed into them, knocking the fender off.

Ms Warren, a Criminal Justice graduate from Cal State Sacramento, got out to inspect the damage and words were exchanged, according to Tiffany Renee.

A man who was in the car then opened fire, shooting Ms Warren in the head and hitting Miss Bean in the side.

The car that had run into them drove away, and one of the attackers fled on foot police said. No arrests have been made.

Both women were taken to hospital, where Ms Warren was declared dead and Miss Bean is said to be in serious condition.

'It appears there was a confrontation that led to a shooting,' police spokesman Officer Gordon Shyy said.

Ken Barrows, whose apartment looks over the parking lot where Ms Warren was shot, said he heard arguing followed by gunfire.

'I heard the arguing ... it wasn't really that bad,' Mr Barrows told ABC 7. '[It] didn't really catch my attention. And then I heard gunshots and that's when I looked out the window.'

Tiffany Renee, who had been in a relationship with Ms Warren for five years, said: 'She was the most loving, compassionate, kindhearted person that you would ever meet, with the biggest smile ever.'

Ms Warren, who was a licensed security guard, had wanted to teach basketball to children and had ambitions to work with youngsters at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center.
