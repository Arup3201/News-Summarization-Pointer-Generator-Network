A New Zealand builder has died after accidentally shooting himself in the chest with a nail gun after climbing down a ladder.

The new father, 31, pulled the nail out of his body but later died from his injuries.

Robert Barr was working on a rural property in Waipukurau, a town on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, on Thursday morning when the tragic accident happened.Â 

Tragic: Young father Robert Barr died suddenly on Thursday after he accidentally shot himself in the chest with a nail gun

'He came down off a ladder, slipped and the nail gun hit him on the shoulder,' his friend Tony Lepelaars told the New Zealand Herald.

'He realised what he had done, walked outside and was sitting on a trailer and managed to pull the nail out.'

Mr Barr reportedly walked to the helicopter that would take him to hospital and was in 'good spirits' before he died.

His boss at local building company Schaw Building Ltd, Marcus Schaw, told Hawke's Bay Today that Mr Barr - a keen rugby player - was 'as tough as buggery and very popular with his teammates and at work'.

'We are pretty heartbroken and everyone is pretty cut up,' he said. He described the incident as a 'freak accident'.

Robert married his wife Laura in 2013 and the newlyweds had a baby daughter, Asher, together.

The rugby team that Mr Barr played over 150 games for is currently deciding whether to play their scheduled home game on Saturday as his teammates have been left devastated by the accident.

MailOnline attempted to contact Mr Schaw for comment.
