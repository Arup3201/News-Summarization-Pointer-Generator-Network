Phillip Schofield was forced to apologise last night after ambushing David Cameron on live television with a list of alleged Tory paedophiles compiled from a cursory search on the internet.

Schofield admitted he had put it together after spending three minutes collecting unsubstantiated gossip online – and that a 'misjudged camera angle' meant some of the names could have been seen by viewers.

Presented with the list, the Prime Minister responded by warning of a 'witch-hunt' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay.

Springing a surprise: Phillip Schofield, seated next to This Morning co-presenter Holly Willoughby, picks up the list of alleged Tory paedophiles  before handing it back to Mr Cameron

This was the extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield, who has now apologised for the stunt, handed the list of names to David Cameron

Downing Street later attacked it as a 'silly stunt' and 'trial by Twitter', while MPs warned it could distract from serious allegations of abuse of children being investigated by a string of official inquiries.

There are growing cross-party calls for a single, overarching investigation now that the number of separate probes into allegations of paedophilia at the BBC, care homes and in Whitehall has reached double figures.

During what was supposed to be an interview on This Morning about dementia, Schofield declared there could have been 'a cover-up, a paedophile ring amongst the elite of great Britain that led all the way to Downing Street' and handed a card with names on it to the Prime Minister.

'You know the names on that piece of paper. Will you be speaking to those people?' Schofield asked.

The presenter admitted: 'It took me about three minutes last night to continually find a list of the same names.'

The Prime Minister takes the card and responds with firm words warning of a 'witch hunt' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay

The Prime Minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the Prime Minister

The Prime Minister did not look at the card on air, instead placing it on the table in front of him, but Number Ten sources confirmed later it had included half a dozen names of senior Conservatives who had been members of or associated with the governments of the 1980s.

A composed Mr Cameron said he did not like what Schofield was doing, saying: 'Look Phillip, I think this is really important. There is a danger if we are not careful, that this can turn into a sort of witch-hunt, particularly against people who are gay.

'I'm worried about the sort of thing you are doing right now... giving me a list of names you have taken off the internet.

Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to Ofcom last night asking the media watchdog to investigate whether This Morning broke TV fairness rules

'Anyone who has any information about 
anyone who is a paedophile, no matter how high up in British society 
they are, that is what the police are for.'

It
 is understood that the passing of the list to Cameron was the 
production team's idea, although it is believed Schofield may have had 
some input into it. It is unclear if the programme took any legal advice
 before doing it.

Schofield later apologised, saying: 'If any viewer was able to identify anyone listed, I would like to apologise and stress that was never my intention.

Mr Cameron had agreed to appear on This Morning to talk about dementia, including an event held at Downing Street where he discuss the issue with TV presenter Fiona Phillips

'I was not accusing anyone of 
anything and it is essential that it is understood that I would never be
 part of any kind of witch-hunt.

'Unfortunately there may have been a 
misjudged camera angle for a split second as I showed the Prime Minister
 some information I had obtained from the internet.

'I asked for his reaction to give him 
the opportunity to make a point which he very clearly made about the 
dangers of any witch-hunt.'

Schofield's on-air ambush prompted 
immediate  condemnation. BBC veteran Jonathan Dimbleby wrote on Twitter:
 'How cretinous can you get – giving a list of online names to PM as 
though they were evidence. Makes a mockery of our trade.'

Tory MP Rob Wilson last night reported This Morning to broadcasting regulator Ofcom, claiming the programme had broken rules on fairness.

He said: 'Some of us have been painstakingly trying to get to the bottom of these allegations about Jimmy Savile and others for months in a responsible and diligent way.

'It is very unhelpful for celebrities to ambush the Prime Minister and reveal information that is not in the public domain for very good reason.

After the TV showdown, Mr Cameron returned to Downing Street where he took a call from US President Barack Obama. He congratulated him on his his re-election

Steve Messham met with Welsh Secretary David Jones this week to discuss his claim he was abused by a senior Conservative while at the Bryn Estyn home in North Wales

William Hague, who as Welsh Secretary set up the Waterhouse Inquiry into abuse at care homes in North Wales, said 'no stone would be left unturned' by a series of new government reviews

'If Phillip Schofield feels his information is watertight, he should take it to the police without delay.'

Former Conservative whip Michael Fabricant said Schofield had been 'very foolish and irresponsible'.

He added: 'I loathe witch-hunts. In this country, you are innocent until proven guilty.'

Tory MP Stuart Andrew, who was a councillor in Wrexham at the time of the original inquiry into the North Wales abuse scandal, described Schofield's tactic as 'completely irresponsible.'

An ITV spokesman: 'It is extremely regrettable that names may have been very briefly visible as a result of a misjudged camera angle, although most viewers would not have been able to read the list.'

An aide to the Prime Minister said: 'This silly stunt has resulted in people's names being put out there.

'They will want to vigorously defend themselves.'

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We shouldn't have people just throwing names and accusations around and trial by Twitter.'
