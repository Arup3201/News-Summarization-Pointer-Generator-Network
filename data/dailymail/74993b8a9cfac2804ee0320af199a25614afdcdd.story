As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

MUHAMED BESIC IN A NUTSHELL

Besic showed enough of his potential in his limited pre-season appearances to leave Everton fans drooling - and if he can match anything like the expectations he is building up, he is sure to be a Premier League star.

The midfield maestro was a £4million signing from Hungarian club Ferencvaros last month and adds another string to Roberto Martinez's bow in the Everton midfield with his ability to spray passes around and to supply the ammunition for the likes of Romelu Lukaku.

The Bosnian is just 21 years old but is already setting a big reputation - and it won't be long until he is unleashed on the Premier League after securing a spot on the bench away at Leicester City.

He is fast becoming a fans' favourite at Goodison Park due to his tough combative style - although that could have Fantasy managers worrying a little about the red and yellow cards he could pick up.

Ready? Muhamed Besic will be hoping you back him in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game this season

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE BESIC IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Martinez likes to get his teams playing with the ball on the floor - and that should give Besic the perfect opportunity to prosper and rake in the Fantasy Football points.

Besic is an exciting player but with the physical knowhow to prosper in the Premier League. Priced at just £5.9million in the game he represents a bargain when you consider that's below the price level of the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Joe Allen and Emanuele Giaccherini.

WORLD CUP STAR 

Besic found himself in the heart of midfield for Bosnia and Herzegovina as they just lost out at the group stage of the World Cup - impressing in particular against eventual runners-up Argentina.

For his country he often found himself sitting very deep in midfield and robbed of the opportunity to showcase his passing in quite a defensive side - but that shouldn't be such a problem at Goodison.

BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? 

Besic might have the tendency to sit a bit deeper in midfield than most but fear not... With Martinez not known for a lot of rotation he should get plenty of appearance points once he establishes himself in the side, a few key contributions to goals and likely win bonuses at Everton should sort him right out.

Skills: Besic has the control and quick-thinking to add a touch of class to Everton' midfield 

Can't stop him: Besic is willing to fight for every ball in the middle of the park - let's hope he gets no bookings!

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Besic has already left a great impression on Martinez, with the Everton boss saying the Bosnian is feeling right at home at his new club - which obviously bodes well for bedding in easily to the Premier League.

'To play in our midfield it’s not enough just to be tactically aware how to contain the opposition,' Martinez said.

'Mo has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he’s a technical player on the ball. I think that’s why the fans took to him so quickly, because he’s very complete. 

'The biggest aspect that surprised me was Mo’s ability to get on the ball, control things and spray it about. When he’s adjusted we’ll see his best football shine. The mentality he showed at the World Cup was incredible for his age.

'Mo is at the perfect place to show what he can do now. He’s an exciting prospect.'

Passing range: Besic sprays a trademark long pass - something Romelu Lukaku could prosper from
