David Beckham and Patrice Evra were surprise guests at Manchester United’s Los Angeles training base on Tuesday.

Beckham, who has returned to live in London with his family after five-and-a-half years in California, is back in town for United’s first game on their pre-season tour of the United States against another of his former teams, LA Galaxy.

He met up with new United boss Louis van Gaal and some of the players and is expected to attend the Chevrolet Cup match at the Rosebowl on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Evra is on holiday with his family in America and took the opportunity to say goodbye to his teammates after joining Juventus for £1.2million.

The France defender, who is ending an eight-and-a-half-year stay at United, wrote a farewell letter to the club and its fans on Monday.

‘This club is, and will always remain, in my heart,’ wrote Evra. ‘Joining and playing for Manchester United has been a privilege, a dream come true and my time here has been so memorable.

‘Through the good times and the bad times we have all stuck together and remained loyal. I have always said you don’t just join Manchester United, you join the family and long may that tradition continue.

‘This club is steeped in history and I feel privileged to have become a part of that. Over the past nine years I have met and worked with some incredible people, many of whom will remain friends for life.

‘I would like to thank everyone at the club – teammates, coaches and in particular all the staff who made every single day in Carrington or at Old Trafford a special day.

‘An immense thank you to Sir Alex Ferguson for making it all possible, for giving me the privilege to be a captain, to be inspired by the legend of Manchester United and to understand that nobody is bigger than the club.

‘My biggest thanks go to the fans. We have had some fantastic times together, we lifted all of those trophies together and that night in Moscow will live with us all forever.

‘Every single time I stepped out in that shirt I knew I was playing for the badge and for a very special club. My passion for this club will live on and I know you guys will go on to enjoy more success in the coming seasons.’
