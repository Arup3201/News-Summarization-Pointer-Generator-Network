A Virginia minor facing child pornography charges says that police, not satisfied with photos they've already taken of his genitalia for evidence, want to photograph him in a state of arousal--by force, if necessary.

Manassas high school student Trey Simms, 17, was charged with manufacturing and distributing child porn in January. Police say he sent his 15-year-old girlfriend an explicit video of himself.

Now Simms faces potential jail time and a lifetime on sex offender lists. And sooner than that, the teen's lawyer says authorities want to force him to become aroused using a drug injection.

Sexual offense? Trey Simms, pictured, says police took pictures of his genitals in January when he was charged with distributing child porn after trading explicit photos with his 15-year-old girlfriend

NBC Washington reports the trouble started when Simms was exchanging texts with his then-girlfriend in January.

The mother of the girl, who was 15 at the time, complained to police, who soon confiscated Simms' iPhone and iPad.

But that evidence wasn't enough for Manassas City police, according to the teen's aunt Stacy Bigley.

'He said they took him to a room and took pictures of his genitalia,' a tearful Bigley NBC Washington. She also said her nephew tried to refuse initially. 'They told him if he did not they would do it by force.'

That was months ago. This week, Simms' defense attorney Jessica Harbeson Foster said authorities want even more evidence with which to try their case and aren't afraid to use force this time, either.

According to the Washington Post, Foster claims the prosecution now wants photos of Simms' genitals in a state of arousal, too.

When she asked how they intended to get such photos, Foster said the prosecutor told her: 'We just take him down to the hospital, give him a shot and then take the pictures that we need.'

A magistrate signed off to allow a second warrant for such a search, which Foster plans to fight.

'This is a 17-year-old who goes to school every day, plays football, has never been in trouble with the law before. Now he’s saddled with two felonies and the implication that he’s a sexual predator,' she told the Post. 'I don’t want him to go through that. Taking him down to the hospital so he can get an erection in front of all those cops, that’s traumatizing.'

Foster is also demanding to know why Simms is the only minor in the case being, which involves two of them sending photos, who's being charged.

'From what I gather, there’s no intention to charge and this was handled inefficiently,' she said.

Simms is due back in court July 15.

Simms' lawyer Jessica Harbeson Foster says prosecutors they intended, if the teen was uncooperative in providing photos of his genitals in a state of arousal, to 'just take him down to the hospital, give him a shot and then take the pictures that we need'
