A camping holiday in Britain requires careful packing. A sleeping bag, coat and jacket are all a must.

But if you've only got room for one of your three essentials, a new all-in-one product promises to be the answer to your problem.

The Doppelganger Outdoors wearable sleeping bag gives you all three. It begins as a short jacket jacket then rolls down into a coat, and a final strip of material unfolds to make it into a sleeping bag.

The first sleeping bag you can wear that doesn't make you look like you're wrapped in a spacesuit

One is outside with a brew while the other is in bed... but both are wearing the jacket-come-sleeping bag

It unzips in sections making it wearable as a coat, jacket and as a sleeping bag

The sleeves are sealable and the bag wraps around your legs and feet. The whole thing essentially
 becomes a cocoon of fibre-filled polyester to keep you warm at night.

In the morning, you can just remove the sleeping bag bottom section turning it into a long winter coat, or a shorter jacket when you need the freedom to move around.

The bottom section rolls up into a packet so small it will fit in your pocket, helping keep your camping kit as minimal as possible.

The whole product, which comes in at £90, rolls up into a 
compressed bag and product promises to be the first sleeping bag you can wear that doesn't make you look like you're 'wrapped in a puffy spacesuit'.

It comes in purple and blue or black and orange and retails online at Japan Trend Shop - who ship to the UK. The product comes in one size, waist 90cm (35 inches), height 183cm (6 ft) and with instructions in Japanese.

The clever sleeve ends fold back for day and zip up for bedtime

The product means you can take a cosy nap wherever you like - as long as you're wearing your nifty coat
