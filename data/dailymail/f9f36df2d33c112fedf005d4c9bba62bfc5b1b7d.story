Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar, who lost his family when a gang set fire to the wrong house in a revenge attack while he was away working, said: ‘You hate crime. You don’t hate individual people.’

His wife Shehnila Taufiq, 47, daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamal, 15, all died when flames engulfed their terraced house in Leicester in the early hours of September 13 last year.

Kemo Porter, 19, and Tristan Richards, 22, have been found guilty of their murders at Nottingham Crown Court.

Six other defendants, Shaun Carter, 
24, Nathaniel Mullings, 19, Jackson Powell, 20, Aaron Webb, 20, Aaron 
Jeffers, 21, and 17-year-old Cairo Parker were cleared of four counts of
 murder but found guilty of manslaughter.

The fire was started as 'retribution' for the fatal stabbing of Antoin Akpom, 20, the prosecution said.

But in a tragic mistake, the killers attacked the wrong house and instead set fire to the Taufiq's family home.

Mrs Taufiq’s husband, consultant 
neurosurgeon Dr Muhammed Taufiq Sattar, survived because he was working 
in Dublin at the time of the tragedy.

During
 the two-month trial, the jury heard that football coach Mr Akpom had 
been stabbed in the back in a confrontation involving two 19-year-olds 
on September 12.

Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said 
the defendants were friends of Mr Akpom and that hours later they 
mistakenly targeted the Taufiqs’ house believing it to be the home of 
one of the 19-year-olds.

The prosecutor said: 'They simply got the wrong house - a tragedy.'

As the manslaugther verdict on Parker was read out there were tears from the public gallery and cries of ‘he’s only a baby!’.

The
 judge Mr Justice John Griffith Williams lifted restrictions on naming 
Parker and said he would hear mitigation tomorrow afternoon before 
sentencing the defendants on Wednesday morning.

An emotional Dr Taufiq said they were an 'extraordinary' and 'charitable' family who dedicated their lives to 'the needy and less privileged'.

He said: 'My beloved wife and three beautiful children I can say they were really extraordinary people. 'They were very charitable.

'They had a strong concern for the welfare of others even before their own comfort. They had devoted their lives to a dream to give to others, the needy, the less privileged and the misguided.

'Four amazing human beings.'

Dr Taufiq added: 'The ultimate goal of these four amazing people was to live and work together with a primary aim to serve community and humanity.'

Leicestershire
 Police said the family died as a result of the gang attacking the wrong
 house to avenge the fatal stabbing of their friend Antoin Akpom hours 
earlier.

Temporary Detective
 Superintendent Kate Meynell, senior investigating officer, 
said:'Emotions were running high, their actions on that night, in my 
opinion, were both misguided and impulsive and obviously had tragic 
consequences.

She added: 'It's the prosecution case that these men sought to avenge the death of their friend Antoin Akpom.

'They
 went to the address to try and avenge the attack and tragically they 
got the wrong address and it resulted in the death of the Taufiq 
family.'

She said the investigation had been difficult due to the stabbing of Mr Akpom taking place just hours before the fire.

Ms Meynell said: 'I think in the first instance the fact that four people have been killed is significant.

'Just trying to deal with the impact that has on the community and the individuals involved is a challenge.

Kemo Porter, 19, and Tristan Richards, 22, have been found guilty of their murders at Nottingham Crown Court. The fire was started in 'retribution' for a fatal stabbing. But in a tragic mistake, the killers attacked the wrong house and instead set fire to the Taufiq's family home instead of their target

'But what this even more difficult was that some seven hours before there had been another murder.

'When we started the investigation we kept both incidents separate because we didn't want to lose any lines of inquiry but after a while it became apparent to us that the two were linked.'

She said CCTV evidence was an important part of their inquiries along with forensic evidence, witness accounts and house to house evidence.

However their main inquiries were around identifying the vehicles used by the defendants on the night of the fire.

She said: 'With the investigation into the fire it was clear to us quite early on that two vehicles were involved in the offence.

'Our main inquiries were around identifying those vehicles, in turn then identifying the movements of those vehicles on the night of Thursday September 12 through to the early hours of Friday September 13, and also after the incident.

'Then we linked into that the people we believed were linked to those cars and who we believed were present at the scene of Wood Hill at the time of the fire.'

Ms Meynell said: 'I think as part of the investigation team we're always aware of the impact that these incidents have on the community and on the families.

'I think it's a great credit to the communities in Leicester that everyone came together. I can only begin to imagine the impact that it has had on people that knew the Taufiq family or knew Antoin but everyone did come together.'
