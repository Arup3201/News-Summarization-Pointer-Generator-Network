ITV bosses are risking a 'self-destructive war' with Simon Cowell by criticising the TV mogul and 'disrespecting' the work he has done for the channel's ratings.

The explosive new biography of Cowell, 52, accuses ITV bosses of being 'disloyal' and 'ungrateful' to the X Factor supremo by not respecting the work he has done in rescuing the channel's plummeting ratings.

The latest revelations from Tom Bower's book, which has been serialised in The Sun, also claim Cowell branded former business partner and talent show rival Simon Fuller 'the Devil'.

Cowell, pictured with Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh while an X Factor judge, has been involved in a simmering feud with ITV bosses, according to a newly-released biography

But the details of the growing feud between ITV and Cowell revealed in Bower's book could strain the talent show boss's relationship with the channel to breaking point, according to the author.

Bower claims the simmering row could force jeopardise ITV's £100m deal to screen The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, with Cowell possibly being forced to offer his smash-hit TV shows to other channels.

The author told The Sun: 'ITV are shooting themselves in the foot by criticising Simon Cowell.

Spilling the beans: Cowell spent time with author Tom Bower, right, but insists the book is still unauthorised

'They are risking a self-destructive war by not respecting the man who has saved their channel from bad ratings when they have failed to create other original and attractive programmes.'

The 'power struggle' detailed in Bowers' unauthorised biography is said to centre on ITV accusations that Cowell was 'disruptive', 'interfering', and was accused of 'spinning too many plates'.

According to The Sun, the fallout continued when it was emerged that Cowell wanted to sack Gary Barlow from The X Factor for his 'stiff performances'.

Judge Barlow, 41, will return to The X Factor after signing a deal worth as much as £2 million to be on this year’s series.

ITV
had earlier this week moved to counter revelations that Cowell had 
wanted the Take That star singer sacked because of lacklustre ratings 
last year.

Best of enemies: According to the new book, Cowell jokingly refers to former business partner and ex Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller as 'the Devil'

The latest revelations in Bower's book also tell of Cowell's bitterness towards fellow pop guru Simon Fuller.

Bower told The Sun that Cowell jokingly calls his former business partner and ex-Spice Girls manager 'the Devil'.

The author goes on to give an account 
of how Cowell first revealed the notion of Pop Idol in 2001 during a 
dinner with Fuller and former judge Nicki Chapman.

Bower
writes: 'The idea, Fuller knew, was nearly as old as television itself,
but he immediately offered Cowell a twist to the Opportunity Knocks 
format that he had been mulling over since 1998: 'The audience should 
decide the winner by telephone voting.' 'Brilliant', said Cowell.'

But
after a verbal agreement to split rights to the show 50/50 broke down 
and Fuller took all the credit for Pop Idol, Cowell is said to have told
Fuller in 2010: 'All I've done, BGT, X Factor and much more, is revenge
for what you did to me. And there's much more to come!'

Tom Bower's book, 'Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell', is released today.

Cowell
himself has since taken to Twitter to insist that although the 
scandalous biography contains a number of lurid anecdotes, it is still 
completely unauthorised.

He tweeted on Tuesday: 'This book is not written by me. It is unauthorised. The writer is Tom Bower.'
