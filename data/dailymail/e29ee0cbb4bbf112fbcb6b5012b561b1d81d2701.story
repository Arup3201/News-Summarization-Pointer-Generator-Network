Having beer on tap was once a distant dream for many.

But the rise of the Kegerator – a combination between a keg and a refrigerator – has meant that freshly poured, draught beer is being enjoying in homes across the country.

The concept was born out of the DIY skill sharing community when those desperate for beer on tap found ingenious ways to get it by re-engineering their fridges.

And it quickly caught on commercially. For instance, Wisconsin-based Nostalgia Electronics is now offering its ‘Kegorator Beer Keg Fridge’ for around $600 (£360).

The pressurised system claims to keep beer carbonated for weeks and even has a portable unit with rolling casters to move it to any party location.

‘Simply place a keg of your favourite brew in the refrigerated chamber and plug in the unit. To dispense the beverage, just pull the tap’s lever,’ the company wrote.

Kegs for the fridge cost an average of £70 ($117) for 12 litres - or 21 pints.

This works out at £5.80 ($9.75) a pint, which means users will pay slightly more than in a pub or bar.

To get beer out of the keg, gas pressure is applied to the top surface of the liquid, which presses the beer from the bottom of the keg up through that metal tube and out of the valve.

For those who want something more, California-based Dream Arcades has gone one better by creating the $5,000 (£2,970) Kegerator Pro 60. The device comes with built-in fridge, a keg with three taps, and more than 140 classic video games. The arcade also has a massive 60-inch HDTV screen

The in-built refrigerator keeps beer fresh by storing and serving it between -1 and 7°C (30-45°F).

For those who want something more, California-based Dream Arcades last year created the $5,000 (£2,970) Kegerator Pro 60.

The device comes with built-in fridge, a keg with three taps, and more than 140 classic arcade games. The arcade also has a 60-inch HDTV screen.

‘Players never have to stop the action to refill their drink’ the company said in a statement.

The arcade also has two built-in cup holders ‘so players can keep their drinks topped off while keeping one hand on the joystick.'

As 
temperatures rise, it is the perfect way to keep your beers cool - and 
not have to make the long trek to the fridge when you need a refill.

A Danish firm has unveiled an underground beer fridge that can be sunk into the garden.

It takes advantage of cooler underground conditions to keep beer chilled. 

Called the eCool, it sinks 24 beers underground.

When beers are removed, the next is automatically pushed to the top using a pulley system.

The entire system, which is just over a metre in height, is sunk underground.

'It’s advised to use a garden drill, but can be installed with a shovel as well, if you’re a real man,' the firm says.

It says the system is ideal for eco-friendly beer drinkers as it uses no electricity.

'Do something great for yourself and the environment.

'It’s easy to install in the garden or terrace, and uses no electricity.

'With the eCool you can always drink a cold beer with good conscience.

The earth cooler is 113 cm in height, 22-30 cm in diameter and weighs 12 kg.

It holds 24 cans and can stay installed the whole year.
