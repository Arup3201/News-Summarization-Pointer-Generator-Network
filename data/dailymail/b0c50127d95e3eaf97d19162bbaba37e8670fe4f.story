Real Madrid have already sent many records tumbling this season - and the campaign has only just reached December.

After surpassing a club record of 15 straight victories by beating Malaga 2-1 in November, Carlo Ancelotti's side have since extended the streak to 18 with a 3-0 triumph over Celta Vigo on Saturday.

That result was spearheaded by Cristiano Ronaldo in lethal form with the Portugal captain firing in all three goals to set a La Liga record of 23 hat-tricks.

The Real side have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League with five wins from five games in Group B

Now, Madrid take on Ludogorets in their final Group B match of the Champions League on Tuesday knowing another victory would mean they overtake a Spanish record of consecutive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Bacelona side in 2005-06. 

Despite easing to the summit of their group and securing qualification to the knock-out stages after only four games, it appears Ancelotti will not rest his artillery for the final group encounter.

Meanwhile, James Rodriguez is a doubt for the Club World Cup after injuring his right leg against Celta Vigo.

Madrid said in a statement that the Colombia star 'has been diagnosed with a grade 1 muscle injury' in his right calf.

'Tests showed he has a small injury,' said Ancelotti. 'We don't have much time left before the (Club World Cup) final, but there is a small possibility that he could play the game on December 20.'
