Hillary Clinton today made the first visit to Burma by a U.S. Secretary of State for more than 50 years.

The diplomatically fraught trip, which will include face-to-face meetings with former members of the military junta, is aimed at persuading Burma to sever military and nuclear ties with North Korea.

During the visit, Mrs Clinton will also visit opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was freed from detention earlier this year.

'I am obviously looking to determine for myself and on behalf of our government what is the intention of the current government with respect to continuing reforms both political and economic,' she said after arriving in the capital Naypyidaw.

'We and many other nations are quite hopeful that these flickers of progress... will be ignited into a movement for change that will benefit the people of the country.'

Mrs Clinton was greeted at Naypyidaw's airfield by a deputy foreign minister, but her presence appears to have taken second stage to the expected arrival tomorrow of the prime minister of Belarus.

Posters have been put up for his visit, and Belarus has a similar human rights' record to Burma.

Officials said she was seeking assurances from Burma's leaders that they will sign an agreement with the UN nuclear watchdog that will permit unfettered access to suspected nuclear sites.

The U.S. and other Western nations suspect Burma has sought and received nuclear advice along with ballistic missile technology from North Korea.

The trip is the first major development in U.S.-Burma relations in decades and comes after the Obama administration launched a new effort to promote reform in 2009.

America's special envoy to Burma has made three trips to the country in the last three months.

North Korea today said it is making rapid progress on enriching uranium and building a light-water nuclear power plant.

A statement from the Foreign Ministry said that North Korea has a sovereign right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and that 'neither concession nor compromise should be allowed'.

Concerns about its atomic capability took on renewed urgency in November 2010 when it disclosed a uranium enrichment facility that could give it a second route to manufacture nuclear weapons.

North Korea has been building a light-water reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex since last year.

Such a reactor is ostensibly for civilian energy purposes, but it would give the country a reason to enrich uranium. At high levels, uranium can be used in nuclear bombs.

Washington has said the reactor would violate UN Security Council resolutions.

President Thein Sein, a former army 
officer, has pushed reforms forward after decades of repression under 
successive military regimes which cancelled the 1990 elections that Suu 
Kyi's National League for Democracy party won.

Last week, Burma's parliament approved a law guaranteeing the right to protest, which had not previously existed, and improvements have been made in areas including media and internet access.

But the government that took office in March is still dominated by a military-proxy political party and commitments to democratisation and a willingness to limit ties with China are uncertain.

Corruption is rampant and hundreds of political prisoners remain jailed.

Burma's army continues to torture and kill civilians in campaigns to stamp out some of the world's longest-running insurgencies.

China laid down a marker ahead of Mrs Clinton's trip by having its vice president meet the head of Burma's armed forces on Monday.

The country also remains subject to tough sanctions that prohibit Americans and U.S. companies from most commercial transactions in the country.
