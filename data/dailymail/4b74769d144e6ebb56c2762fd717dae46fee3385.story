Sam Davies is recalling the December day in 2008 when the unique challenges of offshore sailing came into sharp focus.

She was racing in the Vendee Globe, arguably the world’s toughest endurance event.

It’s the solo round-the-world race where Ellen MacArthur made her name; a race where half the boats that start typically do not finish. Davies was close to Australia when she got the emergency call.

She had been one of the three blondes in Britain’s Olympic boat, but walked away before the 2004 gold because ‘I wanted the adventure of offshore sailing’ — now she was being asked to help a French rival who had snapped his thigh bone.

‘He had been hit by a big wave, suffered this awful injury, and I was one of two boats called by the organisers to help him,’ Davies says. ‘He was completely rooted to the spot inside the cabin and hundreds of miles from land. If he moved he might have severed his femoral artery so he was lying in agony and alone on that boat for about 48 hours.

‘He couldn’t reach his morphine or any supplies. The other boat reached him first and was trying to throw a bag with medicine down the hatch but couldn’t. Transferring him from boat to boat wasn’t an option. Thank god he was in the catchment area for the Australian navy, because that is the only reason he is alive.’

All this came just days after Davies had smashed her elbow and fallen unconscious on deck in the middle of a big ocean. She finished fourth that year, the second-best placing for a woman in the race’s history, but followed it by snapping her mast early in the next edition in 2012.

‘The ocean can be a tricky, dangerous place,’ Davies says. ‘But the fun is in the challenge, right?’

Davies, from Portsmouth, is in Alicante, Spain getting ready for another challenge. The 39-year-old has been named skipper of Team SCA, the first all-female team to enter the Volvo Ocean Race since 2002.

It’s a brutal slog around the world that runs every three years, a marathon spanning 38,739 miles and which represents the pinnacle of offshore racing. The first leg starts on October 11 — a 6,487-mile race to Cape Town — with the cream of the world’s sailors in opposition.

Team SCA's Davies: ‘The ocean can be a tricky, dangerous place. But the fun is in the challenge, right?’

They race yachts that can travel close to 600 miles in 24 hours, the sailors burning upwards of 5,000 calories a day for three weeks at a time, sustained on a diet of desalinated water and rehydrated powder food. The suggestion that sailors cut their toothbrushes in half to save weight is a myth, but it’s not far off reality.

‘My bag has four changes of sailing gear to last a month at sea and my iPod,’ says Davies, whose crew includes four other British women. It is a race of attrition and speed, usually won by the team that sustains the least damage to bodies and boat. The difficulty is told by the scars of the current fleet.

A Dutch skipper, Bouwe Bekking, was forced to abandon his sinking boat in 2006; the Australian Chris Nicholson pulled out in 2009 when he ruptured knee ligaments. There is also Gerd Jan Poortman, on Bekking’s boat, who broke his back in this event.

‘We were told recently that we’ve each lifted in excess of one million kilos in weights to prepare,’ Davies says. ‘The extreme physicality is why women have not been around in the past three editions. The boats got more powerful.

‘Now the rules permit us to carry 11 women whereas a male crew carries eight. That’s three extra brains. Will it make up the strength and experience gap? Let’s see. We’ve left no stone unturned. If we do well, then hopefully we won’t have to wait long until women are back in this race. We are going to challenge some perceptions, to show we belong.’ To say Davies belongs on the water is an understatement.

Her grandfather was a decorated submarine commander in World War Two, whose St Christopher’s charm she wears round her neck at sea. By the age of three, her family were on voyages in their small yacht to France.

‘This race would start in the Solent and I went every time,’ she says. ‘I remember Tracy Edwards’s all-women team in 1989. She was my hero. I got a message from Tracy recently saying I was her daughter’s hero and that kind of brought home to me what we are about to do.’

Davies studied engineering at Cambridge. ‘I was always going off sailing,’ she says. ‘I went away once and got hit by massive storm in the Bay of Biscay. I had told uni I was ill, but my mum gave the game away by calling them to say we were being rescued by a lifeboat and I was going to miss an exam.’

Davies ended up as part of Shirley Robertson’s crew preparing for the 2004 Olympics, one of the original blondes in the boat. But rounding buoys was not enough to satisfy her.

‘Shirley gave me an ultimatum because I was always finding an excuse to go offshore,’ Davies says. ‘I made the decision to leave.’

The team went on to gold; Davies joined the tough world of French solo sailing. She made a greater impact in France than almost any other British sailor before or since.

‘I don’t regret leaving the Olympic programme,’ she says. ‘I don’t think they would have won with me and I need adventure.’

That sense has taken her to the Volvo Ocean Race and a battle of the sexes. ‘We are here to compete,’ she says. ‘And like I say, the fun is in the challenge.’
