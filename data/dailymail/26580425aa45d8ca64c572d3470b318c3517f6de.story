These b-boys clearly have supreme confidence in their moves.

Breakdancing crew Gamblerz have been filmed performing death-defying stunts, balancing on their hands on the edge of a Singapore skyscraper.

The South Korean group risked plummeting 741 feet off the rooftop of the Swissotel to the ground for the LG Uplus advertisement.

Heart-stopping: South Korean b boys perform moves over-hanging the edge of a Singapore skyscraper

In the ad, members of Gamblerz arrive in Singapore and film themselves breakdancing around the city.

They attract attention from passers by in notable locations such as Orchard, City Hall, Marina Bay and Dhoby Gaut.

But later in the video is when it gets really interesting, as the b boys head to the hotel rooftop.

Not a bad view! The Gamblerz gaze out over Singapore in the advert for LG UPlus

Captured by a drone camera, the trio have a dance-off, showing off their skills - but the best is yet to come.

In a heart-in-your-mouth moment, one dancer performs a one-handed handstand while perched precariously on the very edge of the towering building.

As the camera pans above the scene, it appears that there are no safety nets below to catch him if the worst happened.

Smile for the camera: They make it look so easy...

Incredibly, he then begins to dance again, one-handed, while just centimeters from the edge.

Gamblerz formed in 2002 and have won a number of international competitions. 

The video features three members of the crew: 'Kill' (real name Park In-Soo), 'Bruce Lee' (real name Shin Kyu-Sang), and 'Rocket' (real name Kim Ki-Su).
