Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has admitted that he will call time on his career at the Etihad if the club decide they no longer want him.

The Frenchman expressed concerns over his future before City's 3-2 win against Bayern Munich last month, stating there would be 'new players' next season if the club failed to progress in the Champions League.

Nasri has backed his team-mates to reach the last 16 by picking up a result against Roma on Wednesday, but he seems less sure about his own position in Manuel Pellegrini's plans.

He told BeIn Sports: 'I do not know if I will leave the club. If they come to me and they tell me to pack my bags, I will leave.'

Looking ahead to the crunch clash with the Italians, Nasri added: 'If we play our game, we will win against Roma. The greatest risk is to play with pressure and to have this apprehension. 

'If we don't ask questions, and we play our game, then we will do it. We have more qualities.

'If we are eliminated from the Champions League, this is not the fault of the coach, it is the players who are on the pitch.' 

City will qualify for the knockout stages if they win in Italy and CSKA Moscow don't beat Bayern Munich, although a score draw would be enough for Nasri and Co if the Russian side lose.

An unlikely victory for CSKA at the Allianz Arena would mean City are knocked out no matter what their result at the Stadio Olimpico.
