A teenager who raped a four-year-old girl he was babysitting will return to his old school and share its corridors with his victim's brother.

The victim's parents are calling for the 15-year-old sex attacker to be moved to another location after he admitted the crime but avoided jail last week after he blamed his hormones.

Her older brother is also due to attend the same school in Cambridgeshire next year and will face bumping into him between lessons.

Devastating: The four-year-old girl who was raped by a boy, 14, with her parents

The devastated family, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also live in the same street as the child's attacker.

The victim's mum said today: 'I don't want him at the same school as him but I can't move him way from his friends. I just can't do it.

'Believe me I want everyone to know he's there and to write it across the front of the school but I can't.'

Another mother, said: 'I can't believe that the person in question has been allowed back into the school.

'As parents we were not told about it, which I am furious about.

'I feel my daughter is at risk. I am so angry and shocked by what's going on. Whoever's decision it was to place the attacker back at the school has a lot to answer for.

Hormones: The teenager was not jailed after the judge said online porn was to blame for his problems (posed by model)

The culprit, who was a family friend, 
was asked to look after the little girl for two hours while her parents 
attended their son’s Christmas play.

While they were out the babysitter raped her.

The
victim, who has since turned five, later told her father she had been 
attacked by the teenager who told police he 'lost his mind' because his 
'hormones took over.'

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth was slammed for failing to imprison the teen attacker after he admitted the rape in court last week.

The
judge instead laid the blame at the hands of 'society and the world' 
for allowing the teenager to become corrupted by online porn.

One parent from the Cambridgeshire school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'A lot of parents know who he is.

'It makes me worried to think he is among all those young people and looking at people’s daughters.

'He should be moved out of the school and taught somewhere else or at home even. “

The little girl’s parents had trusted the quiet but 'normal kid' to watch her for a couple of hours in return for £10 pocket money.

But when they got home the victim’s Dad was getting her ready for bed when she revealed the babysitter had played a game, promising to reward her with chocolates.

It then came out he had abused her.

The teenager admitted the offence when he was later confronted by the victim’s family.

'I should want to rip this boy's head 
off - but I think I let my daughter down,' the guilt-ridden father said last week.
'I blame myself because I left her in a room with him and made the 
wrong judgment.' 

'Our daughter was just four years old and
so small for her age, she was still wearing age two to three clothing. 
He was a lot bigger than her,' her distressed mother added.

No-one at the attacker’s school was prepared to comment on what safety measures would be in place for other pupils.

But a spokesman said: 'It would be wholly inappropriate to comment on arrangements for an individual pupil.

'The school’s focus will be on ensuring it continues to meet the educational and well being needs of all pupils.'
