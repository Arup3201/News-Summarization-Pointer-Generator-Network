Tragic: A nursery worker was talking on her mobile phone while looking after children moments before two-year-old Rhiya Malin, pictured, was found hanging in a wooden playhouse, a court heard today

A nursery worker was talking on her mobile phone while looking after children moments before a two-year-old girl was found hanging in a wooden playhouse, a court heard today.

Rhiya Malin died after
becoming trapped in a wooden playhouse in the garden at Eton 
Manor Day Nursery in Chigwell, Essex.

Today, nursery manager Karen Jacobs, 38, and nursery assistant Kaylee Murphy went on trial for failing to provide adequate care at the nursery.

Both deny they failed to provide reasonable health and safety measures for the children in their care.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard today that it was a normal occurrence for staff to be on their mobile phones when they should have been looking after the youngsters in their care.

Staff confirmed they were aware that they should not use their phones, but did so when their managers were not present.

Staff realised Rhiya was missing when they came back inside following a play session in the garden and the tot was discovered hanging inside a wooden nursery playhouse with her head trapped.

Desperate efforts were made to resuscitate the youngster and she was rushed to Whipps Cross Hospital, London, but was declared dead at 11.41am on November 7, 2007.

A pathologist carried out a postmortem and found Rhiya had suffered a cardiac arrest due to compression of her neck.

Brunette Jacobs and blonde-haired Murphy, both dressed in black, sat alongside each other in the dock today listening as former colleagues gave evidence.

The jury of seven men and five women heard that immediately before the incident Murphy had been seen talking on her mobile phone when looking after the children.

Giving evidence, nursery nurse Rebecca Bremner told the jury there were 'real staffing difficulties'.

Accused:  Nursery workers Karen Jacobs , right , and Kaylee Murphy, left , went on trial today  

Oliver Campbell, prosecuting, asked: 'How frequently did you see staff using their mobile phones when they ought to have been supervising children?

She replied: 'It would not be an unusual occurrence.

Mr Campbell asked: 'Was anything said by management when this happened?

Miss Bremner replied: 'Yes - they said "you should not be on your phones, put them away".

She
later confirmed: 'It was not an unusual occurrence to see members of 
staff use mobile phones in the presence of the children.

Grieving: Rhiya's parents Jay, left, and Shati, right, are pictured walking to court today

'It did occur - I can't specify exactly, but it would occur during the week. I can't recall it being on a daily basis.'

Rhiya's parents Jay and Shati were sat in the public gallery to hear the evidence.

Mrs Malin wiped away tears with a tissue as the junior deputy manager third in charge, under the deputy and the actual manager Emma Lowman broke down as she was asked to recall the moment she went into the nursery garden when Rhiya's lifeless body had been found.

Miss Lowman told the jury that no 
disciplinary action had been taken against Murphy, who is in her 20s, 
who still works at the same nursery and has been promoted three times 
since Rhiya had died.

Talking about the mobile phone use at the nursery, she said: 'Staff were not supposed to use their phones but they did.

'They knew they were not supposed to be on them - it was not just Miss Murphy, it was a common practice.

Awful: Rhiya Malin died after becoming trapped in this wooden playhouse in the garden at Eton Manor Day Nursery in Chigwell, Essex

'She said staff were aware of the policy that phones should not be used but it was common place for staff to use them.'

She said she would normally text people but 'could not recall' making phone calls.

'We knew people were not supposed to use their phones but they did.

'I would not do it if a manager was there. We knew we were not supposed to do it,' she added.

Mr Campbell, prosecuting, had said: 'Rhiya was left unseen for many minutes and not observed going into the playhouse and was not actually supervised.'

'On the day of this accident Rhiya Malin was dropped off at about 8.30am by her father.

'There were 14 children being supervised by four members of staff.'

However, he said that the quota of staff was reduced when one had to go inside and assist another child, 'leaving three outside supervising'.

He continued: 'At 10.55am they decided to take the children into class and as they got back noticed Rhiya was missing.

'They found her hanging by the neck with her head trapped.

'Rhiya was left unseen for many minutes and not observed going into the playhouse.'

A three-wheel scooter was found in the playhouse at the nursery and Mr Campbell said it was likely that Rhiya had stood on it and become trapped when it moved.

He continued: 'Rhiya was left unseen for many minutes and not observed going into the playhouse, and not actually supervised.'

Two of the playhouses had been purchased from Argos in June 2006 with instructions that they were for children aged between two and six, and that there should be adult supervision when children were playing in them.

Jacobs was not at the nursery on the day Rhiya died but was charged with the offences because it was felt she had failed in her duties as manager.

Jacobs of High Ongar, Essex, and nursery assistant Murphy, of Loughton, Essex, are both charged with failing to discharge their duties under Section Seven of the Health and Safety Act 1974.

They both deny failing to take reasonable care of people who might be affected by their actions at work; failing to ensure that children were adequately supervised in the garden and failing to ensure that risk assessments were carried out and safety check lists were completed.

The case, expected to last about four weeks, continues. 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
