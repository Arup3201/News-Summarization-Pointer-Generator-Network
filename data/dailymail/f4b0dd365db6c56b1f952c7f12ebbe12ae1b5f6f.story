A medal struck by the Royal Mint to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust was unveiled last night, with the first presented to some of the dwindling number of survivors.

Chancellor George Osborne and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who commissioned the silver medal, said it was vital to keep ‘retelling’ the story of the murder of six million Jews.

The first of the run of medals were awarded to survivors and supporters of the Holocaust Education Trust in Downing Street last night, and a limited number will be on sale on the Royal Mint’s website. 

The obverse features the words ‘Liberation 1945’ in a typeface reflecting that used at Belsen, breaking through barbed wire. The reverse commemorates the 11th Armoured Division, the British forces that liberated the camp, and a stylised eternal flame that has come to symbolise the Holocaust victims

Among those who were presented with the first medals were Gena Turgel, 90, who was liberated from Bergen-Belsen in April 1945

Having lost seven of her eight siblings and a tiny nephew in the Holocaust.

Incarcerated in three concentration camps, she survived a trip to the gas chamber and forced marches between the camps and now lives in England.

Ben Helfgott , 85, a Polish born British Holocaust survivor and former champion weightlifter, was another recipient at last night’s reception in Downing Street.

Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which takes schoolchildren on visits to Auschwitz, said: ‘We are delighted that the Chancellor has announced the commissioning of a special commemorative medal to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust.

‘This will mean a great deal to the Holocaust survivors who rebuilt their lives in Britain after losing their homes, families and communities at the hands of the Nazis. The commemorative medal is a perfect tribute for this significant anniversary year.’

Mr Osborne said: ‘Here we stand in Downing Street in tribute to fight against Nazism. In tribute to the millions who died. In tribute to the brave survivors. In tribute to the liberators.

‘And by our very standing in this place – you the survivors, you the liberators, you the people who keep the memory alive, and me and my colleagues, the democratic representatives of a free nation. By our very standing we symbolise that freedom won and tyranny lost. And we restate our determination that freedom will always triumph.’

Mr Pickles added: ‘Shining a light on the darkness of the Holocaust is no easy task. Not easy because it involves reliving one of humanity’s most shameful periods. It means retelling stories that are sometimes too shocking for words.

‘But there is only one way to avoid such monstrosities again – through constant vigilance for the first signs of intolerance.’

The presentation came as David Cameron sought to reassure Jewish leaders of Britain's ability to protect the community following the terror attacks in Paris.

‘We have to recognise that in a modern democracy you can never protect every threat, but we should do everything we can and be as vigilant as we can to help reassure,’ Mr Cameron said after a meeting in Number Ten.

The Prime Minster said it had been deeply moving to be in Paris on Sunday for the unity marches and recalled seeing people holding signs reading ‘Je Suis Juif’.

‘We should use the momentum of those great demonstrations to emphasise what we are in this country: a very successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy,’ he said.

The meeting also discussed rising antisemitism in Britain and growing numbers of anti-Israel boycotts on university campuses.
