Speaking out: Actress Rachel Issac has told how she suffered years of sexual abuse

An actress whose childhood was blighted by years of sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend has waived her right to anonymity in the hope it will encourage other victims to speak out.

Rachel Isaac, who played Trudy in popular sitcom The Office and later acted on Broadway, yesterday chose to talk about the ordeal after finally seeing her abuser brought to justice.

Michael Batten, 70, was jailed for 30 months after a judge said he had ‘brainwashed’ his young victim and that the abuse had ‘tainted’ her teenage years. 

Miss Isaac, 39, told how her mother 
Jayne used to be best friends with Batten’s wife, Non. As a child she 
affectionately referred to her as ‘Mam number two’, and she often 
visited the Battens’ home.

But
 when Miss Isaac was only eight years old, Batten began molesting her. 
The abuse unfolded in ‘snatches’ of indecent exposure, touching and  
molestation while his wife was hanging out the washing or walking the 
dog. 

He went on 
to target her dozens of times over a three-year period as she grew up in
 the Welsh town of Maesteg. Yesterday Miss Isaac said: ‘After Batten 
abused me, he would say, “You mustn’t tell anybody that we did that”.

'He
 made me feel like I was complicit in what was taking place and also 
threatened me that the police would come to take us both to jail if I 
told anybody.

‘As a child I was taught that the police were there to protect us. It was so confusing.’

The
 abuse ended when Miss Isaac began making excuses to avoid going to the 
Battens’ home. But even then, the schoolgirl found that she was not free
 of her tormentor.

Batten
 remained a regular visitor to her family home, and turned up with gifts
 every Christmas Day until she left Maesteg for Cardiff when she turned 
18.

Following her role in The Office in 
2002, in which she acted alongside Ricky Gervais, she went on to tour 
the US in Greek tragedy Medea,  which ended up on Broadway.

She
 also won parts in television dramas such as Holby City and Casualty and
 took other theatre work on both sides of the Atlantic.

But
 her career ground to a halt in 2008 when she was struck down with what 
would eventually be diagnosed as recurrent bouts of shingles and chronic
 fatigue syndrome.

The
 following year the flashbacks, fretfulness and anxiety she had been 
experiencing were diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. Doctors 
told her that the ordeal of sexual abuse was often a common precursor to
 the condition.

But the trial heard that it was not until ex-railwayman Batten approached her on a train in 2009 that Miss Isaac finally felt compelled to face up to what he had done.

She wrote him a letter describing how she lived in a ‘constant state of fear’ and asking how it had felt to strip the underwear off a child who was ‘rigid’ with terror. 

Miss Isaac also contacted the sexual abuse charity One in Four, which arranged counselling. When she decided to take the matter to police this year, the charity contacted officers on her behalf.

Jailed: Michael Batten, 70, was sentenced to 30 months in prison

In a five-page victim impact statement submitted to the judge, Miss Isaac said the abuse had left her ‘lost and cut-off from my emotions’ and had ‘altered who I am, who I should have become and how happy I may have been’.

And she said her usually ‘strident’ mother ‘crumpled’ with horror when she finally revealed her ordeal in November last year.

Batten faced a maximum of five years in jail when he arrived at Cardiff Crown Court for sentencing on Thursday.

Judge Neil Bidder QC told the ‘pillar of the community’ that his reputation had been built on a lie. And he said Miss Isaac’s impact statement was ‘eloquent evidence of the very great harm’ Batten’s abuse had caused her.

Batten, who has two grown-up children from two previous relationships, was convicted of three counts of indecent assault and one of indecency. He was sentenced to 30 months in jail.

Following the hearing, the actress said she was ‘a little disappointed’ at the sentence.But she added: ‘The important thing is that Batten was found guilty, he’s been sent to prison and now everyone knows the truth.’

She went on to say: ‘Many people who hear stories of child abusers never really get a sense of who the victims are because they remain faceless and nameless.

‘Victims like me have often hidden these dreadful secrets for decades due to a sense of shame or fear or both. I realise now that it is only he who should be filled with shame.

‘I hope that by speaking out, it will encourage and empower other people to speak to their families and the police, and to feel confident that they will be believed and that they will be supported.’

And Miss Isaac stressed that victims who did not want to contact the police were not alone. She explained that there are ‘plenty’ of sources of support available, from GPs to counsellors and charities such as One in Four.

She added: ‘Victims do not need to try and cope with what has happened to them on their own.’
