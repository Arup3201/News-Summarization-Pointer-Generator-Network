Britain looks set for another warm and dry weekend and could also enjoy temperatures of 21C in the first days of October - eight degrees hotter than the monthly average.

And forecasters at the Met Office say the last weekend of September will be largely dry with temperatures in London reaching 23C on Sunday.

The unseasonably warm weather has proved a boon for gardeners, who are seeing flowers grow much bigger and last much longer than usual.

In Cornwall, caretakers at Trebah, near Falmouth, say the climate has produced their biggest hydrangeas ever and has left their garden looking like a Monet painting.

The Met Office has predicted a weekend of warm, dry weather for most of the country, with the first days of October set to be up to eight degrees hotter than usual. The unseasonably warm weather has proved good for gardeners, such as those at Trebah, near Falmouth in Cornwall (pictured)

For most people the weekend will be cloudy, dry and warm with the chance of scattered sunshine, perfect for taking a walk in the countryside

Caretakers  say the wet spring conditions followed by a warm summer have lead to their biggest hydrangeas ever, with some growing to the size of a human head

The combination of heavy rainfall over winter followed by prolonged sunny spells and warm temperatures has produced the most colourful season for the flowers.

Head gardener Darren Dickey said: 'This year has been one of the best flowering displays ever and with more flowers still forming the hydrangeas will continue to light up the valley for weeks to come.

'The older flowers also bring added interest during the autumn with the whites taking on pinkish tinges and the blues going a lovely emerald green.' 

The news of warm, dry weather will also come as great news to golf fans watching the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, in Scotland, this weekend.

A spokesman for the Met Office, said: 'The average temperature for England in October is 13.8C, but towards the end of next week we are predicting temperatures to be between 21-22C in the south.

'That's a huge difference. And Glasgow, which has an average October temperature of 11.5C could see temperatures of up to 19C.

'As for the weekend, it will be very windy in Scotland tomorrow but staying dry. It will be a cloudy start for most but brightening up for a sunny afternoon. 

By the end of next week, forecasters predict temperatures in the low twenties for England, well above the October average of 13.8C, which has allowed flowers to flourish much later than usual

Long-range forecast show that the UK could experience above average temperatures all the way into November, meaning more time to enjoy the outdoors

'There is an area of high pressure prevailing over the south, but with clearer skies there could be a frost overnight from Saturday to Sunday in exposed northern areas.

'Saturday will be mostly dry and cloudy for everybody but on Sunday there will be more sunshine with possible temperatures of 23C in London and the south.  

'Temperatures in Scotland could be between 17C and 20C. That's five degrees higher than normal.

'Sunday will be a similar day, a cloudy start with a sunny afternoon, although the winds will be lighter which will be good news for the Ryder Cup.

'Monday will also start cloudy with scattered sunshine. There is also chance of rain overnight in the south and south east, which mat spread further north.

'Temperatures at the start of next week will remain in the low teen and high twenties in most towns and cities, with 17C or 18C possible in Scotland.'

The Met Office has also predicted unusually warm overnight temperatures during the weekend - making it perfect weather for barbecue lovers hoping stay outdoors into the evening.

Ms Young added: 'Overnight temperatures in most of England are going to be between 13C and 14C going from Saturday into Sunday. That's very warm considering an expected daytime temperature of around 20C.

'And it's not just England, Scotland will also see some warm nights. Even in the Shetland Islands, where Saturday overnight temperatures are expected to be around 11C. This is very unusual.' 

Long-range forecasts say Britain could also be in for above-average temperatures until the end of November.

The Met Office's three-month contingency planner states: 'The latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for September-October-November as a whole.'

The Met Office has also highlighted that a split in weather between the north west and south east of the UK will develop more in the next few weeks, with rain and wind effecting northerly parts of Scotland and the south east remaining generally dry.
