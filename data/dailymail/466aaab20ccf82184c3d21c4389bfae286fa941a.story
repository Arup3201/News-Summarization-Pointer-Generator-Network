Sir Richard Branson has confirmed he and his son Sam will be the first passengers on a commercial flight into space in spring 2015.

'I would very much hope that before Christmas, Virgin Galactic has visited space,' the British billionaire and head of Virgin Galactic said. 

'And then we'll move the whole program to New Mexico where myself and my son will be the first people to go up from the Spaceport in the spring of next year.'

However, considering the project was originally scheduled for 'lift-off' in 2008 following around £138 million of investment of Spaceport America in New Mexico, many won't be holding their breath for the maiden voyage.

As well as voters in the deprived region of having to agree to pay 'special taxes' to fund the project since its inception back in 2005, the promise of 700 flights a year by 2015, with two flights out a day, has failed to materialise.

New Mexico's hope that it would be spearheading a new technological age remains a distant dream, despite Branson's latest newscast.

According to Reuters, a grand total of ten jobs have so far actually been created on the site for local residents. That’s 0.33 per cent of the number that was originally promised. And works out at £13.85 million per job.

Branson was speaking at an event at the Rose Space Center and Planetarium in New York in conjuction with Grey Goose vodka, a sponsor for Virgin Galactic's world-first passenger flight into space.

Seats on the flights into space are already being snapped up for the princely sum of £250,000 ahead of the spring launch at Spaceport America in New Mexico.

However, Sir Richard is facing a ‘backlash’ from some of the nearly 700 passengers who have already paid for a ticket on the craft.

Some stumped up the fee as long ago as 2005, but still have no idea when they will eventually reach space. 

The 600-plus takers for the flights are already benefiting from their ticket purchase, which by extension enters them into an exclusive club that has seen them visit Necker Island and the Mojave Desert with Branson along with undertaking G-force training.
