All he wanted to do was talk about how nice his hair was - but in doing so, Jackie Chan has created a word which has taken China by storm: Duang.

Pronounced 'dwong', the actor was being filmed discussing a shampoo commercial he appeared in when he used the sound in a similar way to how Westerners would present something special and exclaim: 'Ta-da!'

In the footage he says: 'I didn't want the commercial to have lots of special effects and my hair look "duang!" - suddenly blacker and shinier.'

People's Daily report that the footage was recorded in 2004 but recently reappeared online, sparking an online frenzy over the sound.

Although many people are using the word to mock the actor, who is seen as a pro-Beijing political figure by many in China, Chan has been a good sport about it all. 'It's quite funny,' he told reporters on the steps of Beijing's Great Hall of the People this week.

And speaking about it at the studio of Hidden Energy, a Chinese reality TV show where he appears as a judge, he said: 'When I came here this morning, everyone was saying "duang duang". I’m confused myself.' 

While Chan is all smiles about the commercial now, it was a different story after the advert aired in 2004.

Authorities ruled that the commercial made false claims, and Chan's reputation suffered.

But now parodies of Chan's shampoo endorsement are spreading online. There is even a new - unofficial - Chinese character for the sound, which has been made by overlaying the two characters of Jackie Chan's name. 

And the actor has joined in the fun, tweeting yesterday: 'So "duang" today!'
