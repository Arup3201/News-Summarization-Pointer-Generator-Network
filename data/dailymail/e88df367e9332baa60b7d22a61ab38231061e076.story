Fears are growing of a neo-fascist uprising in Ukraine as ousted president Viktor Yanukovych called for referendums in every region to determine how pro-Russian the country actually is.

Hundreds of members of the ultra-nationalist Right Sector movement stormed the parliament (Rada) building in Kiev last night, smashing windows and breaking down doors.

The riot erupted just hours before Russia's foreign ministry today warned that ethnic minorities in Ukraine are 'living in fear' of the expanding power of the far-right across the divided nation.

Right Sector activists are angry over the killing of their leader, Oleksandr Muzychko, better known as Sashko Bily, who died in a shoot-out with police in a cafe in Rivne, in western Ukraine, on Monday.

Revenge: Hundreds of members of the ultra-nationalist Right Sector movement stormed the parliament (Rada) building in Kiev last night, smashing windows and breaking down doors

Growing dissent: Right Sector's membership has been growing and has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000

Fury: They are angry over the killing of their
 leader, Oleksandr Muzychko (right), better known as Sashko Bily, who died in a 
shoot-out with police in a cafe in Rivne, in western Ukraine, on Monday

Blame game: The emergence of far-right groups such as Right Sector in Ukraine has been cited by Russia as justification for its move to annex Crimea and protect the peninsula's ethnic Russian majority from Ukrainian 'fascists'

'We will avenge ourselves on [Interior Minister] Arsen Avakov for the death of our brother,' Right Sector member Roman Koval told local media. 'The shooting of Sashko Bily is a contract killing ordered by the minister.'

Meanwhile, Ukraine's deposed president Viktor Yanukovich called for each of the country's regions to hold a referendum on its status within Ukraine, instead of presidential elections planned for May 25.

Fight back: Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh (not pictured) said he plans to run for president in a May 25 election, but is a rank outsider

Well-armed: Right Sector members usually wear masks, helmets and protection for their hands and feet, and carry sticks or iron bars in case of confrontation with riot police

Hard line: Since late November, huge crowds have been camped out in central Kiev, opposing the government's partnership with Russia and calling for early elections 

'As a president who is with you with all my thoughts and soul, I urge every sensible citizen of Ukraine: Don't give in to impostors! Demand a referendum on the status of each region within Ukraine,' Yanukovich, who fled to Russia last month, was quoted as saying in an address to the people of Ukraine.

Yanukovych is currently in hiding in Russia, wanted for mass murder in Ukraine after allegedly 
  ordering police to shoot more than 100 people during last month's 
  anti-government protests.

He fled across the Russian border with a handful of bodyguards towards the end of February where he was granted safe haven by Russia's President Vladimir Putin.

A senior White house official has caused outrage after she posted a 'selfie' on Twitter holding a sign that read: '#United­For­Ukraine @State­Dept­Spox.'

US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was accused of trivialising the crisis in Ukraine when she tweeted: 'To echo Barack Obama today - proud to stand #UnitedForUkraine. World should stand together with one voice.'

The photograph showed her, in a yellow suit, giving a thumbs up and holding the sign.

But her attempt at 'solving the crisis with selfies' was widely mocked online.

'Presenting The Latest US Strategy to Counter "Russian Aggression,"' one blogger posted on zerohedge.com. '#Selfies!'

Another wrote: 'No wonder Putin covers his mouth when speaking to Obama, perhaps to hide his laugh?'

And one wondered: 'How flippin’ sad has the USA become?'

Psaki defended the tweet, saying: 'The people of Ukraine are fighting to have their voices heard and the benefit of communicating over social media is it sends a direct message to the people that we are with them, we support their fight, their voice and their future.'

Insisting he is still the rightful leader of Ukraine, he has sporadically emerged to comment on the ongoing turmoil in Ukraine.

His
 comments, after Moscow annexed Crimea following a referendum there in 
favour of joining Russia this month, echo Russia's call for Kiev's new 
leaders to enact nationwide constitutional reforms that may grant 
broader powers to the country's regions.

'Only
 an all-Ukrainian referendum, not a snap presidential election, can, in a
 significant way, stabilise the political situation and preserve 
sovereignty and Ukraine's (territorial) integrity,' he said.

Ukraine remains deeply divided over protests that led to Yanukovich's ousting and many eastern Russian-speaking regions are sceptical over the policies of the new government in Kiev.

The emergence of far-right groups such as Right Sector in Ukraine has been cited by Russia as justification for its move 
to annex Crimea and protect the peninsula's ethnic Russian majority from
Ukrainian ‘fascists'.

Russia said this month Mr Muzychko was under investigation
for fighting alongside rebels in Russia's Chechnya region in the 1990s.

And as Kiev reeled from the night's unruly demonstrations, U.S. resident Barack Obama issued yet another shot across Russia's bows, demanding it take broader steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine now.

'It's well known and well acknowledged that you've seen a range of 
troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises,' he told CBS. 'But these are not what Russia would normally be doing. And, you know, it
 may simply be an effort to intimidate Ukraine or it may be that they've
 got additional plans.'

And in Russia, the country's foreign ministry today alleged that ethnic minorities in Ukraine are living in fear after the ouster of the country's president and the coming to power of interim authorities that include right-wing nationalists.

The statement by the ministry was in line with Russia's frequent contention that Ukraine's large ethnic Russian community faces repression under the new government that Moscow characterizes as fascist.

The ministry statement raises the stakes on the issue, saying that ethnic Germans, Hungarians and Czechs in Ukraine also feel themselves in peril.

'They are unsettled by the unstable political situation in the country and are seriously afraid for their lives," the statement said, without citing specific incidents.

Russia has brought large numbers of troops to areas near the Ukrainian border and speculation is strong that Moscow could use protection of ethnic Russians as a pretext for a military incursion.

Tensions between Ukraine's ethnic Russians and Ukrainian-speakers continue to plague the country in the wake of the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of protests against him.

The Crimea region, where ethnic Russians are a majority, voted this month to secede from Ukraine and Russia has formally annexed the Black Sea peninsula, a move that Western countries have denounced as illegitimate. Talk percolates of similar referenda in other regions with large Russian populations, although none has been scheduled.

As reports of his public address trickled in, none specified if he envisioned referenda in each region or a national vote, nor did he say what actually should be voted on.

Proposals have been floated by Russia and some politicians to federalize Ukraine - giving the regions more autonomy. The interim authorities reject such a move.

Another warning: And as Kiev reeled from the night's unruly demonstrations, U.S. resident Barack Obama (pictured boarding Air Force One in Rome today) issued yet another shot across Russia's bows, demanding it takes steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine now

Yanukovych's biggest rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, attacked the statement, accusing Yanukovych of being 'a tool aimed at destroying the independence of Ukraine.'

Also today, Russia's president said Ukraine could regain some arms and equipment of military units in Crimea that did not switch their loyalty to Russia.

Russian forces took control of Ukrainian military installations in Crimea this month after Russia formally annexed the Black Sea peninsula. Some Ukrainian servicemen reportedly joined Russian forces, while others withdrew.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday told President Vladimir Putin that the Ukrainian withdrawal from Crimea is complete, Russian news agencies reported.

Putin also approved Shoigu's proposal to turn over arms and equipment of the units still loyal to Ukraine, the reports said. No specifics were given on quantities, types of hardware or timing.
