A father-of-two was slashed across the face with an axe after his pet began play fighting with another dog in the street, a judge heard.

Michael Gaskell, 45, was confronted by a gang just minutes after another dog walker became angry that his Japanese Akita was not on a lead.

After an argument, Michael Parr, 46, warned the self-employed plumber: 'You don’t know what I’m capable of', before he returned, produced an axe from his jacket and swung it at the victim’s head.

Horrific: Michael Gaskell, from Bolton, nearly had his ear chopped off in an axe attack, following a row about whether his dog should be on a lead

Mr Gaskell suffered a massive 10inch gash from his left ear to his cheek and almost lost his ear in the attack. He needed 12 stitches and is now scarred for life.

Today Mr Gaskell, from Great Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester, spoke out about his ordeal after Parr was jailed for eight years.

He said: 'My face was a mess - it was hanging off. Blood was spurting out everywhere.

'I thought I’d lost my ear because it had been ripped so bad. I was just stunned, I couldn’t believe what had happened - it looked like I’d been attacked by a psychopath.

'The axe could have landed right in my head if I hadn’t moved back quick enough and I could’ve been killed.

'The judge actually told Parr he was lucky he wasn’t up for attempted murder. He really did mean to cause me serious damage.'

Mr Gaskell's dog Kia escaped from his garden and approached Parr and his dog, who were walking along the road

The attack happened at 1.30pm on April 14 this year after Mr Gaskell’s dog Kia escaped from his garden and bounded up to Parr’s dog, also an Akita, which was being walked down the street.

Parr got into an argument with Mr Gaskell about whether dogs should be kept on leads, Bolton Crown Court heard.

Mr Gaskell said: 'I have a fence 
surrounding my garden so I thought Kia would be okay and not run off, 
but next thing I knew my son came running up stairs to say she had 
wriggled through the slats.

'Supposedly Kia had gone over to his dog and the two had been play fighting around each other.

'When
I came out the front door I was shaking my head and apologising but 
Parr had Kia by the scruff of the neck dragging her over.

'All
of a sudden he started shouting and screaming at me saying I should 
keep my dog on a lead. I was telling him to calm down, but he carried on
threatening me, saying, "you don’t know what I’m capable of".

'I thought he was being stupid and I just shrugged my shoulders but he stormed off up the road.'

A short time later, Mr Gaskell went to 
visit a neighbour, only to be approached by a gang of men, including 
Parr, by the doorstep.

Mr Gaskell said: 'My friend had just put the kettle on when there was a thud at the door.

'I answered and Mr Parr was there with two other lads, another two standing at the gate.

'He asked me what I was going to do about my dog and I just shrugged it off - I thought he was going way too far with this, his dog wasn’t even on a lead.

'In the corner of my eye I saw him fiddle with something in his jacket - next thing I knew he takes this axe out and swings it at me.

'I dived back but the axe caught me at the side of my head. There was blood pouring from my ear. I thought it had come off because it was hanging down like a big flap.'

'I began to feel an awful throbbing pain and I felt dizzy and weak.'

Parr jumped forward to get in the door to attack Mr Gaskell again but the home owner slammed the door shut in time.

Mr Gaskell, pictured with his dog Simba, said his windows were smashed in with a brick soon after the incident and that Joshua, 15, left, and his daughter Kayleigh, 11, right, had been scared to go out in the street

The victim staggered over to the kitchen sink and held his face together with a towel until paramedics arrived at the house to take him to Royal Bolton Hospital.

He said his windows were smashed in with a brick soon after the incident and that Joshua, 15, and his daughter Kayleigh, 11, had been scared to go out in the street.

Parr denied wounding with intent and possessing an offensive weapon but was convicted after a trial.

He told police he was walking his dog elsewhere at the time at the time of the attack and dismissed Mr Gaskell’s claims as 'nonsense.'
