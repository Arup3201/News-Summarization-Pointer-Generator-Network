Soldiers will go to the top of the queue for a council house or mortgage when they leave the armed forces.

David Cameron said ministers would ‘strain every sinew’ to do more for service personnel and their families.

The Remembrance weekend initiative aims to end the scandal of veterans being left too poor to buy a home and unable to get on a social housing list.

Their foreign postings mean they lack the connection with an area that town hall chiefs look for when allocating council homes.

Ex-servicemen see this as discrimination and, for some, the situation becomes so acute they are reduced to sleeping on the streets.

Housing minister Grant Shapps will issue new guidance to local authorities to put retiring servicemen automatically  into the highest priority category for a council house after  the homeless.

He will call on them to ‘positively discriminate’ in favour of former soldiers, sailors and airmen where tough decisions have to be taken.

Anyone leaving the forces will also go to the top of the list for help through the Government’s FirstBuy scheme, which helps the less well-off buy a house with small deposits.

Under the plans, soldiers will get priority for the first year after they leave the services.

Mr Shapps has negotiated a deal with credit agency Experian, which is used by mortgage firms, to register a Ministry of Defence PO Box for use by servicemen.

That means they will be able to build up the credit rating needed to obtain home loans.

The Government is investing an extra £16million this year in a fund for injured ex-servicemen to install disabled facilities in their homes.

The total budget will rise to £185million.

Mr Shapps said: ‘Our brave men and women in uniform aren’t looking for sympathy and handouts, but all too often their selfless sacrifice for this country can become a major blockade on the road to a home of their own.

‘That’s why house-hunting heroes on the look-out for their first home will be at the very front of the queue for new Government-funded schemes like FirstBuy.

‘Equally, years of loyal military service should not be rewarded with years of languishing on local waiting lists.

'Just as our brave troops answered their call of duty, councils will need to do the same, to ensure that heroes who want a home in their area will be at the top of local waiting lists.’

According to the housing charity Crisis, at its peak a quarter of the homeless population had spent time in the forces – though the  figure is now thought to be around 3 per cent.

That means around 4,000 former servicemen are homeless and many of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.

The predicament is even worse for those who have families to provide for.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve got to strain every sinew as a country to make sure we do right by our armed forces, for those who come home wounded, for those who serve and for their families.

‘The most important thing is to make sure that we’re looking after the family and we’re doing more as a society and a country to do more for the wounded.'
