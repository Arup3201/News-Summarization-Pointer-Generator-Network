A historic house Sarasota, Florida, is up for sale for $1 – and the owners say even that’s negotiable.

But there is a major catch.

The new owner will have to move the house to another location.

What a steal: This four-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot home in Sarasota's most historic neighborhood has been put on the market for a $1

Read the fine print: The catch is that whoever buys the home will have to spend about $130,000 to move it to a different location 

Old-school charm: A couple from Atlanta bought the property in June for $605,000 sight unseen, but quickly concluded that it was too old-fashioned for them 

A house divided: The house will have to be cut in half and reassembled at the new location because it's wider than the surrounding streets

Idyllic: The home at 1215 Pomelo Avenue was built in the 1920s on a tree-lined street in Sarasota 

The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported the cost could run as high as $130,000 with a new foundation and utility hookups.

The house will have to be cut in half and reassembled at the new location because it's a bit wider than the surrounding streets.

House mover Brett Johnson told the newspaper the second level of the home will also have to be removed before relocation.

So, the house is basically free. But it's not.

Robert and Julie Henry, the current homeowners, plan to build a different, more modern house on the lot

The couple have received an offer from a buyer who was interested in breaking apart the house for parts, but they said, 'no'

Robert and Julie Henry, a couple from Atlanta, bought the property in June for $605,000 sight unseen.

But when they drove down to Sarasota to take a look at their new digs, they concluded that it was too old-fashioned for their taste.

The home at 1215 Pomelo Avenue was built in the 1920s. It features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, hardwood floors, a wood-burning fireplace, a study, a formal dining room and a sun deck with a hot tub.

‘It is speculated that this home, once deemed the "farm house", was part of a group of parcels originally owned by Charles Elliott Abbe, Sarasota's first postmaster,’ reads the property’s description on the real estate site Zillow.com.

The home's most recent owner was Robin Speidel, the grandson of noted Sarasota judge Lynn L. Silvertooth who moved into the house back in 1945, and for whom the Sarasota County Judicial Center is named.

Rather than tearing down the handsome historic home situated on a tree-lined street in the Pomelo Park section of Sarasota, the Henrys came up with the idea to put it on the market for less than the price of a cup of coffee.

Interiors: The handsome four-bedroom three-bath home has hardwood floors throughout  

Split up: The house has two floors, but the second story will have to be disassembled for the big move 

Creature comforts: The house features a wood-burning fireplace, a study, a formal dining room and a sun deck with a hot tub.

Sweetening the deal: Bob Henry has even offered to throw in their high-end Viking stove free of charge

Realtor Barbara Sassan May, with Michael Saunders & Company, says the complications have already dissuaded a few potential owners.

One would-be buyer offered the Henrys to take the residence off their hands and break it apart for building materials, but the couple declined.

The Henrys want the house moved by the end of the year so they could start building their new, more modern, home on the lot, reported WFTV.

If they fail to find a buyer willing to relocate the dwelling, they will be forced to demolish it and salvage whatever materials they can.

To sweeten the deal, Bob Henry has even offered to throw in their high-end Viking stove free of charge.
