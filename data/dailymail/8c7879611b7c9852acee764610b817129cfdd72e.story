Berlin's disaster airport BER - running millions in overspend and years behind schedule - has suffered a new embarrassing snag after management bosses admitted this week that they can't turn the lights off.

Three hundred workers are employed at the biggest construction site in the country trying to put right the airport meant to be the most advanced in the world.

But no-one is able to cut the power to thousands of lights burning at least £2,000 worth of electricity every 12 hours in the main terminal hall.

Spot the problem: At least £2,000 every 12 hours are thought to be being wasted on lights at BER Airport

Directing traffic: Some lights at the airport are obviously useful - but others are just draining money

'We are not so far advanced that we can control the lighting,' said Horst Amann, in charge of the technological side of the project which has made Berlin a laughing stock.

'It is true that deficiencies in the control system currently affect the terminal lighting', said a spokesman for the airport company. But he said the lights would be left on at night anyway 'for security reasons.'

Berlin is currently served by two other airports, Tegel and Schoenefeld, both of which are now pouring millions into upgrades as most experts believe BER won't be operating until 2017 at the earliest.

Ongoing saga: The airport is years behind schedule and has almost doubled its budget

It was supposed to open last year. The cost of the project has almost doubled from its original estimate - from £1.7bn to £3.7bn.

It is expected, when the problems are resolved and the airport is open for business, 27 million customers can be catered for.

It has a list of 20,000 things that need to be put right - from fire extinguishers that don't work to doors that won't open...and now lights that won't switch off.
