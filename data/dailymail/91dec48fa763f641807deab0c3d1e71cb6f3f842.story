A prostitute has claimed scandal-hit Senator Robert Menendez is a former client and that he still 'sees a lot of girls'.

The New Jersey Democrat has previously been accused of sleeping with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic - allegations he has forcefully denied.

Now the anonymous U.S. escort - who claims several senators have availed of her services - has identified Menendez in a photograph and said he paid her for sex.

Claims: An escort has said scandal-hit Senator Robert Menendez is a former client

The woman, who is aged in her late 30s, told the Daily Caller she had been paid to provide services of a sexual nature to a number of U.S. senators, including a New Jersey Democrat and other, now deceased, politicians.

The prostitute, who claimed there was significant demand for elite escorts among lobbyists, politicians and attorneys in Washington, said many of her customers use pseudonyms when contacting her. When the newspaper showed her a picture of Senator Menendez, she identified him as a former client.

She described him as a 'hobbyist', a term she said was used to describe clients who see 'many girls, as many as they can'.

'He sees a lot of girls and doesn't seem to have the skills to have a relationship,' said the woman, who received no fee for her interview, according to the report.

Senator Menendez's spokeswoman has not yet responded to the latest allegations.

The politician previously denied that he engaged with prostitutes in the Dominican 
Republic, and one of the women allegedly involved with him claims she 
never even met the Democrat.  

Menendez told reporters 
that he had done nothing wrong as he described 'anonymous, nameless, 
faceless individuals' who have driven false stories into the mainstream 
media.

'That's what they've
done successfully,' he said earlier this month in his first public remarks since the 
allegations began to spread. 'The bottom line is all of those smears are
absolutely false.'

Backing up his claims, 21-year-old Yaneisi Fernandez, who was allegedly hired as a prostitute by a longtime friend and campaign donor of Menendez, denied any participation in such activities. 

'I’ve never been to Casa de Campo, I’ve never participated in those activities, don’t know those people or that man,' she told Univision of Menendez and his friend, Dr. Salomon Melgen.

Menendez's office says he reimbursed Melgen (pictured) $58,500 on Jan. 4 for the full cost of two of three trips in 2010 in which Menendez took Melgen's plane to the Dominican Republic

Melgen and Menendez traveled together to the Dominican Republic in 2010. 

Menendez's public denial came after the FBI conducted a search of the West Palm Beach offices of a Florida doctor who also was the senator's biggest political donor in his re-election campaign last year.

A week before the November election, The Daily Caller, a conservative website, reported that Menendez had used a business jet owned by Melgen to fly to the Dominican Republican for trysts with prostitutes. None of the allegations have been substantiated. It is unclear whether the FBI raid of Melgen's office was related to Menendez.

The reports have dogged Menendez, 59,
as he has assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, succeeding former Sen. John Kerry, who resigned last week to 
become secretary of state. The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating 
the case.

Separately on 
Monday, a prominent lawyer in the Dominican Republic denied claims that 
he hosted outings involving Menendez and prostitutes on his yacht. 
Attorney Vinicio Castillo Seman said in Santo Domingo that he would seek
a criminal investigation into the source of the reports, which he 
called 'absurd.'

Castillo, 
the son of a presidential adviser and the brother of a member of the 
Dominican Republic Congress, said he has known Menendez for about 15 
years but has never seen him with a prostitute. Prostitution is legal in
the Caribbean country.

'I have never seen him behave in any way that was not impeccable and dignified,' Castillo said.

While repeatedly denying any meetings
with prostitutes, Menendez did acknowledge to reporters that he flew on
Melgen's private plane and failed, initially, to properly pay for 
trips. He told reporters he reimbursed some $58,500 from his personal 
funds after it 'came to my attention' and said it was unfortunate that 
the trips 'fell through the cracks.'

'I
was in a big travel schedule in 2010 as the chairman of the DSCC' — the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — 'plus my own campaign 
getting ready for the election cycle,' Menendez said.

Menendez's
office said last week that the senator had reimbursed Melgen on Jan. 4.
His office said Menendez's reimbursement was for the full cost of two 
flights on Melgen's plane to the Dominican Republic for personal trips 
in 2010.

Menendez took a third
flight — in May 2010 — on Melgen's plane for a DSCC fundraiser. The 
trip was reported to the Federal Election Commission as a $5,400 
expenditure by the DSCC for the use of Melgen's plane.

These women claimed that Menendez and Melgen paid them for sex in an interview with the conservative website the Daily Caller

Melgen is a native of the Dominican Republic but has lived in the U.S. since 1980, while Menendez is of Cuban-American descent. He is divorced and has two children. Menendez's office has said Melgen has been a friend and supporter for many years.

Some New Jersey Republicans filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee last fall after The Daily Caller's initial report that Menendez had flown on Melgen's private plane to the Dominican Republic to engage with prostitutes. In response, Menendez's staffers searched records for trips by the senator and found the two additional trips that hadn't been reimbursed.

In 2012, Melgen's practice gave $700,000 to Majority PAC, a super political action committee set up to fund Democratic candidates for Senate. Aided by Melgen's donation, the super PAC became the largest outside political committee contributing to Menendez's re-election, spending more than $582,000 on the senator's behalf, according to an analysis of federal election records
