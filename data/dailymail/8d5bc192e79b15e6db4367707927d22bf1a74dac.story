It would be better for Britain to be poorer but with fewer immigrants, Nigel Farage claimed today.

The UK Independence Party leader said he said he would ‘rather we weren’t slightly richer’ if it means allowing more people into the country to work and create jobs.

But he also revealed his party does not have an official policy on immigration, although he spent ‘many hours’ yesterday discussing it.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed immigration had not bought benefits for Britain and would prefer to curb the numbers moving to the UK even if it makes the country poorer

The government is under pressure after restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain were lifted at the start of the year.

Business Secretary Vince Cable sparked a fresh Cabinet rift on the issue, after he claimed David Cameron will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election.

However, Mr Farage today insisted that immigration had not been of net benefit to Britain and would rather fewer people moved here in future even if it left the country worse off.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The fact is that if people come to this country from Eastern Europe and they’re earning minimum wage, they’re getting tax credits, possibly child tax credits, child benefit, housing benefit, and this so far has been the undiscussed part of this. So I question the economics.

David Cameron will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election, Vince Cable has declared.

The
 Lib Dem Business Secretary said the target was ‘impractical’ and the 
Prime Minister ‘almost certainly won’t achieve’ it by 2015.

His
 intervention could spark a new round of Coalition bloodletting – and 
comes only weeks after he accused Mr Cameron of behaving like Enoch 
Powell.

However, it also risked backfiring by exposing how out of touch the Lib Dems are with public opinion on the issue.

Mr Cable made his comments in the documentary The Truth About Immigration, to be aired tonight on BBC2.

The
 programme released a poll showing that more than three-quarters of the 
public want migrant numbers reduced, and more than half want them to be 
cut ‘a lot’.

Mr Cable said it was ‘not sensible to
 have an arbitrary cap’ on net migration – because many elements which 
make up the target cannot be controlled.

He
 said: ‘So it involves British people emigrating – you can’t control 
that. It involves free movement within the European Union – in and out.

‘It involves British people coming back from overseas.

‘So
 setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful, it almost certainly won’t 
achieve the below 100,000 level the Conservatives have set, so let’s be 
practical about it.’ 

‘The 
idea it should come down to 100,000 is something the Liberal Democrats 
have never signed up to because we simply regard it as impractical.’

‘But if you said to me: “Would you want to see over the next ten years a further 5million people come into Britain and if that happened we’d all be slightly richer?” I would say: actually, do you know what I’d rather we weren’t slightly richer.

‘I’d rather we had communities that felt more united and I’d rather have a situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance of getting a job.

‘So yes, I do think the social side of this matters more than pure market economics.’

It comes as a new poll shows four out of ten Labour voters think immigration is bad for the economy, polling shows.

The NatCen Social Research British Social Attitudes poll found 40 per cent of Labour voters said it damaged growth.

Meanwhile, 22 per cent said it was neither good nor bad, and 36 per cent said it helped the economy.

Mr Farage insisted Britain cannot have its own immigration policy while it remains a member of the European Union.

But he admitted that his own party, which wants thr UK to leave the EU, does not have an immigration policy either.

‘We spent many hours yesterday discussing it,’ he admitted.

‘For example, how do you deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in Britain? Not everybody from politics can give you perfect solutions. We have something like 1m, maybe it’s 2million, illegal immigrants in Britain – how do we find those people? How do we deal with those problems?

‘What we can do very quickly is stop open doors; what we can do is have proper border checks to stop people with criminal records coming to Britain – they’re the things we can do.

‘But to have a total policy solution after the disaster that’s engulfed us since Labour came to power in 1997 is no easy matter.’

Net migration – the difference 
between the numbers arriving and leaving Britain – was below 100,000 
during much of the 1990s before increasing sharply in 1998 under Labour.

From 2004 it was consistently above 200,000 and reached a peak of more than 250,000 in 2010.

After Theresa May entered the Home 
Office it fell to 153,000 by 2012 but rose to 182,000 in the 12 months 
to June last year, driven by arrivals from southern Europe.

The
 Tories pledged to reduce the total to under 100,000 by the time of the 
next election, but the Liberal Democrats never signed up to the policy.
