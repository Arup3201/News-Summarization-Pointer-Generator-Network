Instagram account, ByeFelipe, documents some of the worst abusive messages women receive on dating sites, such as Tinder.

From threats of violence to comments on bra size, the account is enough to make any woman want to avoid internet dating.

But Texan blogger, Karen Cheng, wanted to show that not all Tinder men are bad – and set up a trap to prove her point.

Texan blogger, Karen Cheng, wanted to show that not all Tinder men are bad – and set up a trap to prove her point. Pictured above are the common words used in the responses sent by men on the app

She created up a fake female Tinder profile of a girl named Lisa used an automatic tool to right-swipe 1,000 profiles of men in San Francisco and another 1,000 in New York City.

Right-swiping means that you would like to be matched with that person. If that person also swipes right on your profile then you’re a match and can message them.

In this experiement, a thousand matched and then messaged Lisa. Since this was a robot and not actually her, none of the men received any responses.

Ms Cheng says this high number isn’t unusual on Tinder. ‘Her match rate was actually 70 per cent,’ she told DailyMail.com.

The experiment was a response to Instagram account, ByeFelipe, allows women to share screenshots of abusive messages they receive on dating sites, such as Tinder

Ms Cheng said she thought some men may become hostile after being ignored, as shown in these screenshots from ByeFelipe's Instagram account. However, this was not the case

‘There are a lot more men than women on Tinder, and often times a large fraction of the men in a women's swipe queue have already right-swiped on her, so they're "pre-swiped" in a sense and will insta-match.’

Here's a unique way to find your next date.

Canadian engineer James Befurt was tired of wasting time on Tinder, so he decided to take matters into his own hands.

Using a computer programme, along with a clever motor setup and a stylus, the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Java developer came up with a way to get through as many of his potential soulmates as quickly as possible.

Apple recently revealed that Tinder was one of the most downloaded apps of the year. And - until now - it required users' undivided attention while perusing profiles.

But Mr Befurt's hilarious contraption, shown in the video below, allows Tinder fans to swipe right forever - or at least until they run out of potential matches near them.

Ms Cheng said she thought some men may become hostile after being ignored, as shown in sites such as ByeFelipe.

But out of 1,007 men who messaged Lisa, none turned aggressive or rude.

‘Just about everyone who messaged her was friendly and respectful,’ said Ms Cheng.

‘Sure, there was teasing, guys who were straightforward about their intention to hook up, and plenty of bad pickup lines.’

‘But no one became hostile or resorted to name-calling.’

Some of the matches took the time to ask her meaningful questions.

Many of them even Googled her company - which was listed in her profile - in an effort to make conversation.

‘So if these Tinder horror stories are so common, how come we didn’t find a single one among over a thousand messages?’ Ms Cheng writes on her blog.

‘It’s like shark attacks. We hear about them in the news every summer, but only five people a year die of shark attacks.

‘It’s the negative stories that get all the attention. Stories about men being decent and polite just aren’t as interesting as the stories of men being jerks.’

‘But here it is. Evidence that the vast majority of guys are actually pretty decent.’  

Bye Felipe reveals that many men become instantly aggressive when a woman fails to show interest. However, Ms Cheng believe the claims have been exaggerated

The account shows that many of the women find themselves facing a barrage of indecent questions. Ms Cheng says this isn't common. 'It’s like shark attacks,' she says. 'We hear about them in the news every summer, but only five people a year die of shark attacks'
