Atletico Madrid have opened talks with Chelsea over a potential deal for German World Cup winner Andre Schurrle.

Schurrle only joined Chelsea last summer for £18m from Bayer Leverkusen and has failed to hold down an automatic place.

Atletico expressed an interest last week but are pressing for an answer from Chelsea. Jose Mourinho though would prefer to sell other foreign players rather than the versatile forward.

And the 23-year-old would appear to want to stay at Stamford Bridge after stating he hopes to replicate his success at the World Cup with Chelsea this season.

The German forward scored three goals to help his country reach the final in Brazil where they edged out Argentina in extra time.

And Shurrle is confident Chelsea can usurp Manchester City as league champions.

'I want to win titles with Chelsea and we have an opportunity this season,' he told The Sun.

'I need to take the experience of this summer and make the next step at Chelsea, to step up and play a big role this season with the confidence I have.

'Right now, I feel so confident. I’m tired but feeling better and better.
