Rising levels of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has been blamed for increasing temperatures, but elevated levels of CO2 could also be damaging our crops.

A field study of wheat has shown that its nutritional value decreases when it is exposed to higher levels of the greenhouse gas.

The issue is caused when plants turn nitrate into proteins.They do this to stay healthy, but CO2 inhibits their ability to perform the process.

Rising levels of carbon dioxide could make crops like wheat less nutritious, claims a new study

This means their nutritional value drops as they struggle to stay alive.

In the study Professor Arnold Bloom of the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California and his colleagues exposed wheat to varying levels of CO2.

They showed that under elevated levels of CO2, as compared to regular levels, the level of nitrate assimilation was slowed.

Protein and nitrogen concentrations decline in plants under elevated levels of CO2.

This decline could be caused by the plant growing larger with more CO2, diluting the protein in their tissues.

Carbohydrates could also accumulate on the leaves, decreasing the amount of a prevalent protein called Rubisco.

Elevated CO2 also inhibits plant nitrogen metabolism.

All in all, increased CO2 reduces the amount of protein in crops.

This makes them less nutritious for humans.

‘These findings imply that food quality will suffer under the CO2 levels anticipated during this century unless more sophisticated approaches to nitrogen fertilisation are employed,’ they write.

The food quality of field-grown plants has already begun to decline, but until now no plausible theory had been put forward to explain why it’s happening.

This research is the first to point the finger at CO2 as the cause of this decline.

The study examined samples of wheat from 1996 and 1997 in the Maricopa Arigultural Center near Phoenix, Arizona.

During that period air enriched with CO2 had been released on the fields, similar to what is expected to be present in the air by 2030.

Alongside this a controlled planting of wheat in ambient air was also grown.

Leaf material from the plots was then iced, dried and stored in vacuum-sealed containers.

This allowed Professor Bloom and his team to study the plants and make their findings with methods that were not available when the experiment was first performed over a decade ago.

Nitrogen fertilisation (pictured) has been touted as a possible solution, but it can harm the environment

Other studies have shown that protein concentrations in wheat, rice, barley and potato tubers decline by about eight per cent on average under increased levels of CO2.

The expected rise in the CO2 in the next few decades will in turn drop the protein content available to humans by about three per cent.

While small, it is an effect that could snowball if left to get out of control. One possible solution is nitrogen fertilisation to sustain nitrate levels in the plants.

However, this would have an adverse effect of leaking nitrate into groundwater and increasing emissions of nitrous oxide, another greenhouse gas.

A new method of fertilisation might instead need to be devised in order to counteract the effects of rising CO2.
