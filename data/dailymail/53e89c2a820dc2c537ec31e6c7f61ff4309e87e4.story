Rafa Nadal's recovery from a wrist injury that ruled him out of two US Open tune-up events is on track, the Spanish tennis federation said after the world No 2 underwent tests.

Nadal sustained the injury during practice late last month and the 28-year-old Majorcan left-hander has been training with a cast on his right wrist.

He was forced to withdraw from this week's Rogers Cup in Toronto and next week's Cincinnati Open, putting in doubt his title defence at the year's final grand slam at Flushing Meadows in New York starting at the end of this month.

'Following a scan and clinical evaluation, his progress is on track, although he will still have tests from time to time,' the RFET said on their website.

Nadal on Monday posted a picture of himself working on court with his uncle and coach Toni in which a black wrist support was clearly visible.

'Making the most of these days to continue training, always with desire and optimism,' Nadal wrote.
