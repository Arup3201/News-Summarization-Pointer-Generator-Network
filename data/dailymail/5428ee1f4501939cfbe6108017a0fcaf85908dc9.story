Piece of cake: Fans of the show have said Paul Hollywood isn't just interested in Kate Henry's (pictured) delectable desserts

After serving up a succession of perfect pies, it was perhaps inevitable that Kate Henry would win the coveted ‘star baker’ award on last week’s episode of the Great British Bake Off.

But according to fans of the hit BBC series, it seems judge Paul Hollywood isn’t just impressed by Kate’s ability to produce faultless flaky pastry and delectable desserts.

A number of viewers took to Twitter after Wednesday night’s programme to comment on the flirting between Hollywood and Kate, a furniture restorer from Brighton – and claimed they were more interested in watching the pair making eyes than pies.

One Twitter user wrote to Hollywood: ‘We’re watching your little smiles to certain #GBBO contestants, very very very closely – Kate Henry particularly. Watching u.’

Another wrote: ‘The chemistry between Paul and Kate #ooft #GBBO’, while one tweeted: ‘Paul Hollywood mainly wants a bite out of Kate #gbbo’.

Other fans claimed the attraction was mutual, suggesting that Kate, a 41-year-old mother-of-one, was flirting too and that viewers could ‘tell by her eyes’. 

However, it seems that some of the tweets touched a nerve with Hollywood, with one user claiming their account had been ‘blocked’.

Hollywood, 48, made headlines last year when he split from his wife Alexandra over his affair with Marcela Valladolid, his co-star on the American version of the TV baking competition. 

However, Hollywood has since been reunited with Alexandra, and publicly acknowledged that his affair was ‘a big mistake’.

Alexandra, 50, also spoke earlier this year of reconciling their marriage: ‘It has been a tough year – it’s really hard when you have your life splashed all over the papers but you’ve got to get on with it and make the best of what it is.’
