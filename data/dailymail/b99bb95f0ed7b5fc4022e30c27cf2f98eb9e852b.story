Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries 

Authorities considered Chloe Valentine to be 'at risk' before she was even born, an inquest into the four-year-old's death has heard.

By the time she was six-weeks-old, Families SA had received multiple calls about Chloe, including one saying her mother had almost set fire to a mattress on the lounge room floor where the baby was sleeping. 

Tragically Chloe, from Adelaide, died in January 2012 from injuries sustained over a three-day period in the backyard of a home at Ingle Farm, in the city's northeast.

Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, 22, and her then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in jail after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Chloe through criminal neglect. 

Giving evidence on Wednesday, Salvation Army employee Katie Lawson said she was Polkinghorne's case worker in 2007 when mother and baby lived in Salvation Army supported accommodation.

Ms Lawson said she was contacted by a worried friend of Polkinghorne's who said the then 16-year-old's first comments after Chloe's birth were that she was 'glad it was all over so she could get pissed again'.

Ms Lawson also learned from Families SA it had received a notification relating to concerns about the then-pregnant Polkinghorne, leading it to consider the unborn child as being 'at risk'.

The Salvation Army worker said she began to have concerns about Polkinghorne, particularly when she asked for food vouchers after having received $1300 in benefits a few days before.

'Ashlee was very good at telling us what we wanted to hear,' she said.

Chloe died at the hands of her parents in Adelaide in January 2012

She was repeatedly forced to crash the motorbike over a three-day period 

The four-year-old suffered massive head injuries and her mum and partner were later jailed for neglect 

The godmother of four-year-old girl, who was surrounded by drugs and squalor and forced to ride a 50kg motorbike despite repeatedly crashing it, gave up on reporting her chronic neglect to authorities in the months prior to the girl's death, the inquest heard. 

Chloe's godmother, Krystal Lee Benyk, said she contacted Family SA's child abuse report line on multiple occasions with complaints about Chloe's living arrangements, but it seemed to make no difference as the young girl was never removed from her mother.

Eventually Ms Benyk gave up reporting Chloe's neglect, despite believing she was being abused by Polkinghorne's partner in the months leading up to her death.

'Four-and-a-half years of reporting did nothing,' Ms Benyk said.

'You lose all faith in the system.' 

Ms Benyk,wept as she told the inquest on Tuesday that her god-daughter was adamant that she hated her mother and would become highly distressed when she had to return home from visits.

Ms Benyk who cared for Chloe for periods of up to five weeks, believed her drug-using mother, Polkinghorne, was incapable of looking after her. 

Polkinghorne and McPartland waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance after Chloe eventually became unconscious.  

Ms Benyk said Chloe stayed with her overnight from an early age but some visits lasted for weeks because Polkinghorne would disappear and ignore phone calls.

Polkinghorne invited visitors to do 'whatever they wanted' at her house because there was no parental supervision.

'Ashlee didn't care about herself,' Ms Benyk said.

'She didn't care about putting herself in danger and she wouldn't care about putting Chloe in danger.'

On one occasion when Polkinghorne handed 15-month-old Chloe over for a visit, Ms Benyk noticed the girl was lethargic and that her milk had curdled in the heat.

She later took Chloe to hospital after she vomited repeatedly but Polkinghorne did not respond to phone calls until the early hours of the morning.

Polkinghorne said she could not come to the hospital because she was 'off her face' on drugs.

Chloe's grandmother, Belinda Valentine, has pleaded for changes within Families SA, calling for specialised staff training to prevent such deaths. 

Drug user Ashley Polkinghorne was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter for the criminal neglect after the death of her daughter 

Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents'

Polkinghorne's partner Benjamin McPartland was also jailed for criminal neglect 

Families SA received 20 notifications of Chloe's dreadful circumstances during her short life, with reports of rats in one squalid residence; old nappies, rotting food and bugs in another; drug use and violence in Chloe's presence; and human faeces smeared on a bathroom wall. 

But despite Chloe's dreadful circumstances, she was never removed from her drug-using mother. 

The inquest was told, Chloe's short life was marred by chronic neglect.

On Monday, counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, gave an overview of the case at the start of the inquest into the death of Chloe in January 2012. 

'The pain she must have endured in the last few hours of her short life is difficult to comprehend,' said Ms Kereru.

She outlined the extensive involvement of Families SA, dating back to when Polkinghorne became pregnant at 15, and its responses to numerous neglect notifications from family, friends and other agencies. 

'Miss Polkinghorne claimed she was a better mother when she took amphetamines, as she would pick up Chloe and feed her and change her nappy ... as opposed to when she was drunk, when she would prop Chloe's bottle up to her mouth and leave it there,' Ms Kereru said.

Polkinghorne was reported as having told her crying daughter: 'shut up you bitch', and having her child in her arms when a partner punched Polkinghorne twice.

When questioned about this, Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents'.

Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 

She was often visited by Families SA workers, but usually on scheduled dates when they found Chloe's living conditions acceptable.

One friend who contacted Families SA about her concerns, said: 'This is one that will slip through the cracks, Ms Polkinghorne can be a very convincing liar'.

A conversation was also recorded with Polkinghorne which was passed on to Families SA. 

Police advised they found Chloe in the care of a 15-year-old who was drinking in a park on a cold night and on another occasion at a shopping centre, while Polkinghorne was in a nearby liquor shop.

Belinda Valentine told The Advertiser the inquest which started today should not turn into a 'witch hunt'. 

She said: 'We can't change what happened to Chloe but, as a society, we have to learn from the tragedy of her death to prevent more children being damaged.' 

The coroner will hear evidence from numerous witnesses, including those who notified Families SA and the organisation's workers.
