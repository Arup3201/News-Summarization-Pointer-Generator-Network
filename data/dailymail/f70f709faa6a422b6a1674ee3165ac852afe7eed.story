Prince George who celebrated his first birthday yesterday, has undeniably earned himself the title of Royal cutie but it looks like the one-year-old may grow up to be a real Prince Charming.

Hungarian graphic designer and illustrator, Nikolett Mérész has created an image of what young Prince George might look like at the age of 18.

The artist referred to the genetic traits that George has developed from his mother and father when using a computer to generate the final image.

In order to predict what the Prince may look like as an adult the artist studied his current appearance very carefully.

Nikolett, 30, also referred back to images of the Royal baby's parents when they were younger in order to create an accurate prediction of his future appearance.

She told the Herald Sun: 'Prince George has a very similar face to William’s when he was a 
toddler. But, at the same time, his cheeks look a lot like baby Kate’s 
and that can’t be ignored. Especially as Kate has dimples, which are 
also a dominant trait, so it’s very likely George will have them as 
well.'

According to Nikolett, George should expect to develop his mother's dimples (left) but should avoid his father's thinning hair (right)

In order to make the final product the artist combined the current facial traits of both George's parents.

'To create the remainder of the image, I merged Kate’s hairline, ears 
and edge of mouth with William’s nose, brows, forehead and lips.'

Although we can expect George to develop the same enviable dimples of his mother and face shapes of his father there are some attributes that the Prince can expect to avoid.

Nikolett continued to say that she didn't believe that George would suffer from the same hair thinning that we have recently noticed on his father Prince William.

'It looks likely that George won't go bald, as that trait is passed down on the mother's side, and given her brother James and father Michael's full heads of hair, the little prince should also keep hold of his!'
