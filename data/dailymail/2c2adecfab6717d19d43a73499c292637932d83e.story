Jackie Siegel's partially finished dream home known as Versailles will include a theater inspired by the Paris Opera House, a bowling alley, roller-skating rink, and 30-car garage.

The 47-year-old mother-of-eight from Windermere, Florida, is the star of The Queen Of Versailles, an award-winning documentary chronicling Mrs Siegel and her billionaire husband, David Siegel, as they build their 90,000-square-foot mansion modeled after France's 17th century
Palace of Versailles.

Mrs Siegel, who recently resumed construction on the sprawling house after creditors went after her 
husband’s company, Westgate Resorts, and work on Versailles was halted, told New York Magazine: 'We’re going to inlay the floors with a lot of onyx and amethyst and semiprecious stones.'

The mansion is the largest single-family home in America, with a custom-made stained-glass oculus, 10,000-square-foot spa and a commercial kitchen with a Benihana-style grill.

Explaining their master suite, Mrs Siegel, who won the Miss Florida 
beauty title in the Nineties, said: 'We’re gonna have a round platform with a round bed, and it’s going to have buttons so you can watch TV.'

The master bathroom will include a Jacuzzi, his-and-hers 
showers, and a third in the center - in case they 'want to take a shower 
together.' Gesturing at the space between the his-and-hers showers, she said: 'Because this, is too far to walk.'

The ten staff quarters located inside the mansion each include a jacuzzi and a kitchen.

Mrs Siegel, who was branded as 
'tacky' and 'ditzy' after the documentary premiered at the Sundance 
Festival last year, explained: 'People said, "Why do they need ten 
kitchens? That’s ridiculous!" But it’s 
because they’re in the staff apartments.'

Under construction: The mansion is the largest single-family home in America, with a custom-made stained-glass oculus, 10,000-square-foot spa and a commercial kitchen with a Benihana-style grill

The mansion's doors are made from one of world’s last batches of Brazilian mahogany. The former beauty queen casually remarked: 'They had to stop
exporting it because they were cutting down the rain forest, or 
whatever.'

As well as 30 bedrooms, the home will have 23 bathrooms with views over Lake Butler, about 20miles outside Orlando.

Meanwhile, she said that the 
mansion's mezzanine will be used for 'an orchestra for the people 
downstairs. Or speeches. Like if the president came.'

Mrs Siegel
said that once her dream home is complete she would like to launch her 
own reality show. But Mr Siegel, 77, said he has no interest in getting 
back in front of the camera.

He is only intent on finishing work 
on the mansion which has been under construction for more than five 
years, after the financial crisis and recession delayed progress - 'but now we’re doing better than ever' he said of his company.

Controversy: Mr Siegel filed suit against the filmmaker, Ms

depiction of his company's downfall was inaccurate and damaging to his 
business

He actually filed suit against the filmmaker, Ms
Greenfield, before the documentary even premiered, claiming its 
depiction of his company's downfall was inaccurate and damaging to his 
business. 

Mr Siegel, the founder of Westgate Resorts, a real estate and timeshare business which employs thousands of people across the U.S. - many of whom lost their jobs during the recession - said he was happy for Ms Greenfield to film the house, but 'then the economy changed,' he said.

'I don’t know how it happened, suddenly 
the focus wasn’t the house. It became the family, and then it became the
business.'

He added: 'The only thing that’s true about [the documentary] is that my wife is a big-busted shopaholic. Jackie, they could have called her an ax murderer, and she’d have been happy they spelled her name right.'

Premiering on Bravo, The Queen of Versailles, filmed by Lauren Greenfield, will premiere on April 29.
