Preparing the garden for winter is something we all have to do - usually as a reluctant activity one Sunday afternoon - but for workers at Britain's oldest and largest topiary it is a mammoth six-month job.

By this time of year the usually perfectly sculpted shapes of the trees and bushes at Levens Hall in the Lake District are starting to look a little fuzzy round the edges.

And it takes a team of four men and their shears until February to complete the ten-acre garden's annual haircut.  

Time for a snip: The ten acres of topiary gardens at Levens Hall in the Lake District require a six-month tidy up every autumn to keep them looking perfect

Getting to work: Head gardener Chris Crowder, 52, has worked at the gardens for 27 years and lives in the house that was built for the first head gardener 300 years ago

All shapes and sizes: Levens Hall houses Britain's oldest and largest topiary gardens, as most were town down in the 1730s after going out of fashion

Head Gardener at the topiary, Chris Crowder, said: 'It is certainly a big job. We usually kick off around now, and then hope to finish by Christmas, although the snow can hold us back - and it's usually February when we finally put down our shears.

'By late August the bushes and trees are starting to look untidy, but you have to be careful not to start clipping too early. If you do that then you are in danger of having to do the mammoth job twice a year.'

The topiary at Levens Hall, which dates back to the 17th century, is unique as it is the only one which has survived the shifting fashion in gardening.

Snow problem: The team of four gardeners hopes to be finished by Christmas, but snowy weather can often hamper their efforts and take the project into February

Gardening heights: The gardeners use many of the same methods utilised back in the 17th century, though hydraulic lifts are often used instead of ladders

Stroke of luck: It is only by chance that this topiary survives, as the family which owned Levens Hall had a second home which they were more fashion-conscious about, and therefore did not mind this garden falling behind in terms of style

The first seeds were sown in the 1690s - a time Mr Crowder, 52, describes as the golden age of topiary gardens.

But not long after, in the 1730s, landscaping became more popular and many of the gardens were ripped out.

Mr Crowder, who lives within the grounds of Levens Hall in a house that was built for the very first head gardener more than 300 years ago, added: 'The reason why this topiary has remained was partly due to the fact that the family had a second house.

'They were more fashion conscious when it came to that home, and the topiary at Levens was allowed to remain. It was a much-loved garden by the family, and a quirk of chance has meant it remained.'

The garden was started by Frenchman Guillaume Beaumont when the house was sold to Colonel James Grahme - Keeper of the Privy Purse to King James II.

The way in which the garden is maintained has changed little in its 324-year history.

Variety: The shapes are made from small-leaved evergreens Yew Taxus baccata, Golden Yew Taxus baccata 'Aurea' and various forms of Box Buxus sempervirens

Timing is key: It is important the gardeners do not start work on the topiary too early, otherwise it will need to be trimmed twice the following year

Shears and clippers are still used to trim the trees into shape, although a hydraulic lift has replaced the ladders that were once needed to reach the tops of the highest.

Mr Crowder, who has worked at the topiary for 27 years, said: 'One of the things that is so special about this job is the continuity. The tidying up of the topiary has taken place every single year for the past 300 years.

'It makes you feel connected to the gardeners of the past. The topiary is much the same as it always has been, it is mainly the flowers underneath the trees that change.

'The way in which visitors enter the garden is quite unusual, through a small side door.

'This then opens up into an amazing and magical scene. I am lucky enough to work here every day, but for visitors, it is a spectacular sight.'

The shapes in the topiary are made from tight-growing, small-leaved evergreens Yew Taxus baccata, Golden Yew Taxus baccata 'Aurea' and various forms of Box Buxus sempervirens.

The garden at Levens Hall is open to public between April and October. It closes this year on October 9.
