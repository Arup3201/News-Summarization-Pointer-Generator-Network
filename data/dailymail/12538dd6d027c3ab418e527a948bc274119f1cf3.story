If you want your marriage to have a fairytale ending, don’t spend a fortune on a fairytale wedding.

Because, according to a leading family lawyer, couples who overspend on their big day are headed for divorce.

Amanda McAlister, head of family law at Slater and Gordon, said eight in ten couples who divorce within five years cite spending too much on the wedding as a reason.

But she praised Keira Knightley, whose wedding earlier this month was a low-key affair.

Low key: Only 12 guests were invited to Keira Knightley's wedding to Klaxons musician James Righton

Understated: The couple chose this town hall in the south of France for their wedding and were driven away in a Renault Clio

She said: ‘Young people are already under increasing financial pressure with tuition fees and high rents, and the prospect of a lavish wedding ceremony is a huge added strain.

‘The example set by Keira Knightley of abandoning the limo, big dress and expensive cake is one that could prove essential to ensuring a stable and successful partnership.’

Miss Knightley wore an old dress, was driven to the ceremony by her mother in a Renault Clio, invited only 12 guests to the wedding, and gave a low-key reception for just 50.

By contrast, Miss McAlister said that young people are frequently drawn into spending over £30,000 on their wedding day.

‘However, after the honeymoon period, 
when reality bites, repaying such sums becomes a great strain on the 
relationship; along with the ever-increased costs of starting a family 
in the shadow of uncertain economic times.

‘In the heat of romance and celebration it can be too easy to ignore the
often crippling long-term implications which naturally impose a huge 
strain on new relationships,’ she said in a letter to The Times.

She endorsed the view of High Court family judge Sir Paul Coleridge, head of the Marriage Foundation think tank, that more couples should key things low key.

‘More should be done to tackle the issue of young couples in debt and the rising cost of getting married,’ she said.

‘As unromantic as the concept may seem, keeping spending on wedding ceremonies reasonable will build solid foundations for couples and allow the greater financial security that is imperative in today’s economic climate.'
