Rising
profits: The dark yellow net margin line on this graph spikes from August 
this year upwards, with Ofgem predicting that suppliers' margins will 
level out more next year if fuel bills and prices remain the same

Profit margins at the ‘big six’ energy firms have leapt more than 700 per cent as millions worry about keeping warm this winter.

The average amount of profit per  customer has risen from £15 a year to £125 in just a few months, according  to the industry regulator Ofgem.

The increase is a result of inflation- busting price rises that have pushed up the average annual dual fuel bill by 15 per cent, or £175, to a record high of £1,345.

Most of this rise, £110, has gone straight into the profits of British Gas, Scottish & Southern Energy (SSE), E.ON, npower, EDF and Scottish Power.

The increase – challenged by the power firms – will infuriate families and pensioners struggling to cope with the biggest cost of living squeeze for at least 60 years.

Charities and consumer groups fear an increasing number will have to make a nightmare choice this winter between heating and eating. Some 4.5million households are in fuel poverty, which means they  may have to ration their heating  this winter.

However, bills are predicted to rise another 25 per cent over the next four years, taking one in  four households – 7.25million – into fuel poverty.

Customers will be hit by a ‘double whammy’ of having to pay for expensive imported gas and a £200billion programme to switch to wind, wave, solar and nuclear power to meet EU green targets.

Families can protect themselves and make savings of as much as £300 a year by switching energy suppliers. However, many have been deterred because they do not understand tariffs or trust the energy firms.

Yesterday Ofgem announced a radical shake-up designed to simplify the complex array of 400 tariffs that make it virtually impossible to find the cheapest deal.

Energy firms blamed the price increases on increased dependance on importand and rising wholesale costs

Figures from Ofgem show the rise in suppliers' profit margins, as well as the corresponding price hike in fuel bills to over £1300 for customers

In future there will be a uniform standing charge and simple unit costs for electricity and gas to help people make comparisons.

Mike O’Connor, chief executive of the 
official customer body Consumer Focus, said news of the increased 
profits would ‘deepen the mistrust that consumers feel toward their 
suppliers’.

With around 400 tariffs available, Ofgem said most consumers view the energy market as overly complex and hard to navigate.It hopes that by forcing suppliers to provide a standard no-frills tariff, consumers will be able to make more informed choices about their energy bills.Here is a breakdown of its tariff reform proposals, which the regulator hopes could be implemented by next winter:● Each supplier can only have one standard tariff per payment method, per fuel. The three payment methods are direct debit, pre-payment meter and standard credit, such as credit cards and cheques.● Consumers will get a simple unit price and a fixed standing charge set by Ofgem - enabling them to choose the cheapest standard tariff more easily. The regulator hopes this will enable households to tell at a glance whether they can save money by switching supplier or moving to a new deal.● All other tariffs must have a specified end date and fixed terms and conditions. With these "innovative" tariffs, there will be no restrictions on the number, type, structure or duration of fixed term contracts, including exit penalties.● Automatic rollover at the end of the contract will be banned. Customers who do not sign up to a new deal when their fixed term contract ends will default to the standard tariff. They will also be free to switch.● Ofgem wants all energy prices to be displayed in pounds and pence, for example '£/month' as well as 'p/kWh'. Its research shows that consumers can relate better to information presented this way. It will be the equivalent of an 'APR' comparison for gas and electricity.● Suppliers will have to publish the price of all their tariffs in the same way so consumers can compare between standard and fixed term tariffs. This will ensure greater transparency.

Energy firm profit margins fluctuate 
depending on the price they pay for wholesale gas and electricity, 
coupled with other business costs, versus the retail price charged to 
customers.

Generally, the retail price is high enough to guarantee a 
profit.

Occasionally, wholesale prices  rise so high that, for a short 
time,  the energy firms make a loss  per customer.

However, overall the wholesale cost of
gas and electricity has risen by around 20 per cent since 2008, but the
price charged to customers has leapt by 60 per cent.

Profits at British Gas, the UK’s 
biggest supplier, soared by around a quarter in 2010 to a record 
£742million. The firm claims the figure will be down this year.

Its managing director, Phil Bentley, insisted Ofgem’s numbers  were wrong.

‘We are working hard to keep bills as 
low as possible for all our  customers,’ he said. ‘Ofgem’s report is 
misleading. The methodology  is flawed.’

Christine McGourty, of Energy UK, which speaks for the big suppliers, also dismissed Ofgem’s profit margin figures.

‘A snapshot of profits every few months does not provide a realistic picture of the average profits over a year,’ she said.

‘Energy companies do need to make a profit as they are investing billions each year.’

Energy Secretary Chris Huhne has 
called a summit of industry leaders, consumer groups and regulators for 
Monday to find ways to help customers this winter.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'We
think a simple format should be applied across all tariffs, so that 
people can compare the full range of energy deals at a glance.'

Rising
utility bills helped push consumer price inflation up to 4.5% in August
and are forecast to send it close to, or even above, 5% as all of the 
recently-announced increases come into effect.

Scottish
Power was the first of the major groups to raise prices when it put gas
tariffs up by 19% and its electricity charges by 10% from August 1.

Market
leader British Gas increased gas bills by 18% and electricity by 16% in
August, while in September Scottish and Southern Energy raised 
electricity by 11% and gas by 18%, along with E.ON, which increased its 
electricity prices by 11.4% and gas by 18.1%.

Npower
raised gas prices by 15.7% and electricity by 7.2% from October 1, 
while price rises of 15.4% for gas and 4.5% for electricity come into 
effect for EDF customers on November 10.

An undercover investigation by 
consumer group Which? recently revealed that even staff at energy firms 
are confused by the dizzying amount of tariffs offered by suppliers.

Energy
firms were found to be providing customers with incorrect information 
about the number of tariffs available and are being kept in the dark 
about the best deals, undercover research has found.

Suppliers have already started to move to address some of Ofgem's concerns.

Earlier
this week, Scottish & Southern Electricity announced plans to sell 
all of the electricity it generates on the open market, compared with 
the regulator's proposals that 20% of all supplies must be auctioned by 
2013.
