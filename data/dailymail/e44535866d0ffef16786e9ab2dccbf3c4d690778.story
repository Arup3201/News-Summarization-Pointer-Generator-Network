Ed Miliband has been attacked for lacking a ‘credible’ economic message and leading a ‘policy-light’ party by Labour’s biggest donor has said.

John Mills, the chairman of shopping giant JML, warned that the Labour leader does not have a ‘clear idea on how to get the economy growing again at a reasonable speed and how to get the deficit down to a much more sustainable proportion’.

The scathing assessment came as a 
poll showed the public view the Labour leader as as less competent and 
trustworthy than Gordon Brown.

Weak: Gordon Brown was seen as stronger in the days after his election defeat than Ed Miliband is now, according to a damning new opinion poll

The millionaire, who made the remarks to LondonlovesBusiness.com website, has given Labour £1.65 million in shares this year.

He is the only substantial business person to back Labour under Mr Miliband, with most of Labour’s funds still coming from trade unions.

‘The whole political spectrum is policy-light and this includes the Labour Party,’ Mr Mills said. ‘I’m not sure anybody has a compelling message.’

Asked why Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor had not communicated a strategy, he said: ‘That’s a very good question but patently this hasn’t happened’.

Mr Mills is also the chairman of Britain for Business, a campaign group which is demanding that the UK renegotiates its relationship with the European Union.

He said of Mr Miliband’s refusal to promise a referendum was ‘not a vote-winner on the doorstep and the Labour leadership has to weigh this up’.

His praise for Mr Miliband was limited to him being a ‘very nice person’ and a ‘very capable speaker’, but the tycoon added that anybody in opposition ‘always looks like a pygmy’.

A damning new survey shows voters think Mr Miliband is weaker and more dithering than Gordon Brown.

Pressure: Mr Miliband has seen his poll lead eroded amid speculation fears an upturn in the economy could write-off his election hopes

Leadership: The YouGov poll found voters thought Mr Miliband was less 'in touch' and more 'dithering' than Mr Brown

Strength: More people thought Mr Brown was trustworthy and more thought Mr Milband was weak

Voters also believe Mr Miliband is less decisive than his predecessor – despite the criticism of Mr Brown that all he did in office was launch countless policy reviews.

After two and a half years in the job, the YouGov poll for the Times showed that more than 50 per cent of the public regard him as out of touch, dithering, weak or unclear about what he stands for.

Fewer than one in five believe he is decisive or strong. The characteristic most often associated with Mr Miliband was that he dithered.

More people regard him as incompetent – 42 – to competent – 28. And even more view him as untrustworthy – 40 per cent – compared to trustworthy – 29 per cent.

However, the public did regard Mr Miliband as honest, with 39 per cent believing he was truthful compared to 24 per cent who did not.

Compared to Mr Brown after polling day in May 2010, Mr Miliband was seen as being more on the side of a select few (34 per cent to 38 per cent) and more dithering (57 to 56).

However Mr Miliband was regarded as a better leader of the Labour party than Mr Brown by 32 per cent of voters, while 17 per cent he was worse and 41 per cent he was no better or worse.

A separate poll to monitor the public’s perception of Boris Johnson found that the London Mayor’s colourful private life had made no impact on his popularity.

Asked by ComRes whether the revelation that Mr Johnson had cheated on his wife and fathered a child with his mistress would make it less likely for them to vote for him in a general election, 76 per cent disagreed and just 15 per cent agreed.

UKIP supporters were the most relaxed about Mr Johnson’s philandering, with just ten per cent saying they were less likely to vote for him because of it.
