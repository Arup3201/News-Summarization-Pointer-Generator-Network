Teachers who under-perform will have their salaries frozen under plans to end the system of national pay deals for classroom staff.

Annual rises for teachers will be scrapped and heads given almost complete freedom to dictate salary increases in the shake-up outlined in the Autumn Statement.

National pay scales which virtually guaranteed teachers annual £2,000 rises will be axed from next September. Instead heads will award increases based on annual appraisals of performance in the classroom, allowing them to reward the best teachers and limit the pay of the least effective.

The reforms also mean that heads will
 be able to withhold the 1 per cent pay rise due for public sector 
workers in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Only those on the lowest salaries in 
three broad pay bands will be guaranteed the increase.

The move – which will be put out to 
consultation – strikes at the heart of national pay bargaining and 
severely weakens the power of teaching unions.

Ministers hope it will boost 
standards in the classroom. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 
‘These recommendations will make teaching a more attractive career and a
 more rewarding job.

They will give schools greater flexibility to respond to specific conditions and reward their best teachers.’

Chancellor George Osborne tells MPs in his Autumn Statement today that headteachers will be given the power to pay teachers more if they perform better in the job than colleagues

But union barons declared war over 
the ‘disastrous’ and ‘cynical’ proposals, raising the prospect of a 
fresh wave of strike action in schools.

Currently, teachers move up the main 
pay scale according to length of service in the classroom. The system 
has meant that long-serving but under-performing teachers are paid the 
same as more capable colleagues.

Under proposed reforms, heads would be able to promote a teacher from a £21,000-a-year salary to £51,000 in just six months.

The plans were unveiled by George Osborne following recommendations from the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB).

The Chancellor said national pay 
arrangements for civil servants, prison officers and NHS staff will 
continue, but told MPs there would be greater flexibility for schools.

‘The School Teachers’ Review Body 
does recommend much greater freedom for individual schools to set pay in
 line with performance,’ he said.

National pay negotiations will remain
 but agreed rises will no longer be guaranteed for the vast majority of 
staff. Heads will instead have discretion over whether to pass the 
increases on.

Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, said the independent STRB may have been 'leant on' - a claim denied by the Government

However the Chancellor appears to 
have abandoned plans for regional pay bargaining for schools, which 
could have meant that a teacher in the north-east was paid less than one
 in the south-east.

Under yesterday’s proposals, detailed
 national pay scales for teachers will be ripped up and replaced with 
three broad pay bands – starting at £21,804, £34,523 and £37,836 for 
teachers outside London.

While teachers will be protected from
 pay cuts, heads will have wide discretion to dictate salaries within 
each band based on classroom performance – including pupil results – and
 accelerate staff through the three levels.

There is already an element of performance-related pay for more senior teachers, which will be strengthened and extended to all.

The changes apply only to teachers, 
with pay arrangements for heads and deputies remaining largely 
unchanged. Heads of state-funded academies and free schools already have
 the freedom to dictate teachers’ pay. Yesterday’s proposals apply to 
the majority of schools which operate under the auspices of local 
authorities.

Chris Keates, general secretary of 
the NASUWT union, said the independent STRB may have been ‘leant on’ – a
 claim denied by the Government. ‘The war on teachers waged by the 
Coalition Government continues,’ she said.

‘If implemented, the STRB’s 
recommendations would leave behind the wreckage of a national pay 
framework which will be incapable of delivering consistent, fair and 
transparent approaches to pay.’

Teacher Emma Taylor says the reforms 
announced by the Chancellor yesterday were already in operation in many 
academy schools in England.

Miss
 Taylor, 40, right, is a primary school teacher in Stroud, 
Gloucestershire, and has taught children of varying ages during a 
15-year career.

Miss 
Taylor, who is on the upper pay scale two, said the effectiveness of 
George Osborne’s reforms will depend on the ability of the head teacher 
at each school.

She said: 
‘This could work but only if there are good head teachers to implement 
it. In some schools there certainly are those who are fair.

‘But in others it could be used to get rid of teachers who the head would like to replace. 

‘It really does depend on the head teacher. I do not think that would necessarily be fair. 

‘It is already commonplace in academy schools but not in those run by the local education authority.’

Miss Taylor added: ‘I have already proved that I am a very good teacher by reaching the upper pay scale. It would not be right for me to be paid less at a different school if I have already been judged to be worth that amount.’
