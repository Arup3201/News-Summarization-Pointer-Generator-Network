She's the Hollywood star with a penchant for goofing around and photobombing her A-list pals, but as her latest fashion campaign proves, Jennifer Lawrence can do serious and ladylike too.

The 24-year-old actress has starred in a fourth campaign for French fashion house Dior, and with her short blonde hair slicked back and contoured cheeks the Oscar winner exudes old school Hollywood glamour in the AW14 shoot.

Speaking in a behind-the-scenes video, Jennifer opens up about working with renowned fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier, who captured the shoot.

'Working with Patrick is such a privilege. He is a legend and he has such an incredible eye for beauty. All of his photographs are effortless and timeless,' she said.

Clearly using her acting skills to her advantage, the Hunger Games star explains how she perfects her picture pose.

'I feel like every time you get in front of the camera, it's important to have a character in mind, or even an emotion, just so you have something in your eyes,' she said.

When asked  what she thinks makes a powerful woman, she said: 'It's someone who exudes confidence, and who can be tough but fair and kind - and who also knows how to get what she wants.'

Other than filming for the third instalment of the Hunger Games, Jennifer has been spending a lot of time with Coldplay star Chris Martin.

Although their relationship was only revealed last month, it was recently reported that Chris has fallen in love with Jennifer - and after seeing these images, it's not hard to see why.

Chris, 3,7 and 24-year-old Jennifer were spotted stepping off a private jet together in Van Nuys in Los Angeles on Saturday, looking very much like a couple who have been together for some time. 

This is the first time the father of two and his Silver Linings Playbook star girlfriend have been seen together since their romance was reported in April.

The relationship was revealed in August but they first sparked rumours they were dating after they were spotted in deep conversation at the after party for Coldplay's Royal Albert Hall gig in London on July 1 and reportedly spent the following weeks texting each other.

Chris - who has daughter, Apple, 10, and son, Moses, eight, with Gwyneth Paltrow - is reportedly so smitten with Jennifer that he has been writing songs for her.
