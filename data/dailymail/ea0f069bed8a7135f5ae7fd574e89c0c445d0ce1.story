Carol the elephant has been welcomed back to Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Mississippi after her mysterious drive-by shooting this time last year.

The 40-year-old circus favorite will take to the stage in Tupelo on Thursday night after rehabilitation from being shot in the shoulder in the early hours of April 9 while in her enclosure.

No one has ever been arrested for the attack despite a $34,000 reward - the only lead being grainy surveillance footage showing a white SUV speeding away from the scene at 2am.

Return: Carol the elephant was shot last year in April while in Tupelo, Mississippi in a shocking crime that has never been solved

'She's back with a vengeance,' trainer Kathy Carden said. 'She's awesome.'

Tupelo Police Lt. Jerry Davis said he’s frustrated, but will not give up hope of making an arrest.

'The case is still being investigated,' he told NBC News.

'Detectives are still working on it; we just do not have any new information to follow up on at this time.'

The Mayor of Tupelo, Jason Shelton, said the attack was cruel and he is annoyed they have not caught the culprits.

'It was quite frankly an embarrassing moment for the city, but hopefully those days are behind us,' said Shelton.

The shooting led to improved security for the animals of the circus in their fenced-in parking lot home.

Elephant and trainer: Kathy Carden said that Carol is ready for her return and has not been affected by the shooting

Wound: This is where Carol was shot - just behind the neck in the shoulder

All healed: There are still bullet fragments in Carol's wound which means that police have not been able to do a full ballistics analysis of the shooting

And for the past year, trucks have been parked in a ring around the animals to add to their protection.

And for this week, Tupelo Police said that they will increase their patrols around the animals while the Barnum & Bailey's show is in town.

Kathy Carden said that Carol is not nervous about returning to action.

'I’m excited to get there and see everybody and show everybody in Tupelo that Carol is great,' she said.  

Headlights: The only evidence that police have to go on is this surveillance footage which shows two faint car lights of a white SUV

Cathy said that despite their reputation, she believes that Carol doesn't fully comprehend what happened to her.

'She doesn’t understand that somebody tried to maliciously hurt her; she doesn’t understand that. She just had a little boo-boo; we fixed it right away,' said Carden.

However, Cathy says she has not forgotten.

'They intentionally tried to harm Carol, kill Carol, but they could have killed anyone of us. We were all in R.Vs. We were parked in my R.V. with my family, my two little boys and my husband.'
