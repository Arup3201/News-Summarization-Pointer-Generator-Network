Five-year-old British brain cancer patient Ashya King has left intensive care in a hospital in Prague after undergoing potentially life-saving treatment.

Jana Kulhankova, spokeswoman of the Proton Therapy Centre of Prague, said the boy had been moved into his own private room following another round of proton beam therapy.

'Ashya left the intensive care unit on Tuesday and has been put in an individual room,' she said.

He has 'started to put on weight, he is smiling, and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him,' she added.

Ashya King has been moved from intensive care to his own private room after undergoing another round of potentially life-saving proton beam therapy, a spokesman for his hospital in Prague said

Ashya's older brother Naveed (pictured), yesterday revealed that charity Kids N Cancer were refusing to release £50,000 raised for Ashya's treatment to the family, after the NHS agreed to cover the cost

Proton beam therapy uses a stream of fast-moving subatomic particles to destroy cancer cells, and is similar to conventional radiotherapy, but causes less damage to surrounding tissue.

Ashya has already undergone several round of the treatment, with the thirtieth and last of the sessions will take place on October 24.

His case made headlines after his parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, fled Southampton General Hospital with their son in September.

The pair were concerned about the side effects of treatment he was to receive in the UK, and instead wanted to have the boy treated with proton beam therapy in Prague.

When the NHS said it would not fund the treatment, they fled to Spain where they planned to sell a house before travelling on to Prague.  

However, Hampshire Police issued a European Arrest Warrant after discovering the family had left hospital in the UK and the couple were held by police in Malaga in Spain. 

Ashya was taken to hospital and the Kings were told none of the family could visit him.

The couple were held in prison for 72 hours before international outcry - including criticism of the 'heavy handed' treatment from Prime Minister David Cameron - led to the order to release them.

Following tests Ashya was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy, and in an usual move the NHS agreed to fund the treatment on September 26.

Ashya's case rose to prominence after the boy's parents were arrested in Spain while trying to take their son abroad for treatment, afraid that the radiotherapy used in the UK would cause excessive damage to his brain

But in further controversy, a children's charity that raised £50,000 to fund Ashya's treatment said yesterday that it would not be handing over the money because the NHS was covering it.

Ashya's older brother, Naveed, said the family has sent a request to Kids N Cancer for the money to cover the cost of their legal bills, but were branded 'greedy' by the charity.

He wrote on Facebook: 'We have asked Kids n Cancer to support us with paying for the legal fees involving the custody and the release of my parents from prison as well as living expenses whilst we are in Prague. 

'Kids n Cancer came back with a reply saying that they were not willing to help us, they said we are greedy asking for help... 

'Kids N Cancer have never given us any money and they are refusing to help us now.'

 Kids n Cancer said while it had been prepared to meet the £100,000 cost of the treatment in Prague, because the money had been donated specifically for the therapy this would now be used to help other children in similar need.

The charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity's aims.
