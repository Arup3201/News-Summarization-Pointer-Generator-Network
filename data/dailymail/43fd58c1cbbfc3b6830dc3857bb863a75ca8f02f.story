The distraught teenage sister of April Jones said today she dreams of hugging her murdered sibling just one more time and to hear her say 'I love you'.

Jazmin Jones and the five-year-old were 'inseparable' and the room they shared is exactly as it was when she was abducted and killed last October.

April's bed in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, is still made and is covered in her favourite cuddly toys to remind her bereft family 'she will always be with us', the 17-year-old said.

'I wish I could feel her hug me or hear her voice say "I love you" just one more time,' Jazmin told The Sun.

April was kidnapped and murdered by Mark Bridger, who coaxed her into his car as she played on her bike on October 1 last year.

But Jazmin has admitted she wishes she had been there to protect her sibling.

'I couldn't do anything that night. I felt so helpless. I kept thinking it can't be April — it must be a joke,' she said.

Bereft: April's funeral was last Thursday, which saw her parents Coral, Paul, and siblings Harley and Jazmin cling to one another for support

Before he killed April, paedophile Bridger had stalked local girls online and police found pictures of children, including Jazmin, on his computer.

But the student said today: 'I don't think of him. My mind is always on April.'

It came just four days since April Jones's family were finally 
able to say a formal farewell to their ‘sweet, 
innocent little girl’.

Her mother Coral sobbed with grief as she joined hundreds of mourners at April's funeral in Machynlleth last Thursday.

The
tight-knit town in mid-Wales came to a standstill as the 
youngster’s tiny coffin made its final journey from her home to the 
packed church where her funeral was held.

Pure grief: April's mother Coral sobbed as she entered the church, wearing a bracelet bearing her daughter's name

The horse-drawn carriage was filled with pink flowers that spelled out April's name.

It
sat alongside a small golden crown and a card from her parents and 
siblings that read: 'Shine bright like a diamond. Find happiness with 
the angels April.'

As the family arrived, a poignant 
montage of images of April played on a 50inch flat screen TV taken from 
the family's own album of images.

The
images were put together as part of a GCSE school project by Jazmin.

Machynlleth, which has stood behind the family throughout the trauma, was 
also decorated in the five-year-old's favourite colour of pink and 
ribbons were hung from railings, shop windows and lampposts.

It is very nearly a year since April was snatched as she played just a few yards from her terraced home.

The youngster had been allowed to stay out a little later
than usual following a glowing report from teachers at her primary 
school.

It was then that the
father-of-six Bridger conned April, who was friends with one of his 
daughters, into his Land Rover before speeding off.

He then fled back to his remote cottage in Ceinws, where it is thought April suffered a violent death.

Despite
a mountain of evidence stacking up against the former abattoir worker, 
including fragments of a child’s skull in his fireplace, Bridger 
vehemently claimed he could not remember what he had done with April.

Following a month long trial at Mold Crown Court, a jury rejected his lies and a judge sentenced him to a whole life tariff.
