Its 6million festive ad was dubbed 'one of the greatest ever' and became a social media sensation

And it seems the popularity of the 90-second clip has translated into sales success for John Lewis.

The department store group enjoyed an ‘outstanding’ festive period, smashing its December sales record.

The ad that shows a boy impatiently waiting for Christmas to give a present to his parents ends with the line 'for gifts you can't wait to give' and certainly seems to have struck a chord with the British public.

Strong sales of clothes and electrical items helped the department store take more than £500million in the festive build-up.

The John Lewis advert cost £6million to make - but helped bring in almost £600million in pre-Christmas sales

The retail bellwether, which operates 35 stores, said sales were up 9.3 per cent to £596million in the five weeks to December 31, up 9.3 per cent on last year and 6.2 per cent higher on a directly comparable basis.

Online revenues rose 28 per cent, 
boosted by a near doubling in the number of shoppers using its click and
 collect service, while like-for-like sales, which exclude new store 
openings, were up 6 per cent.

The
 ad, which features a seven-year-old boy impatiently counting down the 
days until he can give his parents their present on Christmas morning, 
became a social media sensation after its November launch.

Retail
 experts said the fantastic success of the ad, called The Long Wait, 
contributed to John Lewis’s remarkable sales figures which dramatically 
bucked the depressed trend elsewhere on the High Street.

In contrast Next's refusal to follow the high street trend of huge pre-Christmas discounts led to a drop in sales.

The
 fashion chain admitted to a 'disappointing' sales performance today for
 high street sales between August and Christmas Eve, triggering a slump 
in its share price.

Figures
 showed that sales at Next were down 2.7 per cent on a year earlier, 
despite the previous year's figures being hit by cold weather.

But the group, which operates 520 stores, was cheered by the strength of internet trading, with a 16.9 per cent rise in its online and catalogue Directory business.

Overall sales for the Next brand were 3.1 per cent higher, in line with its guidance in November.

Although the final week before 
Christmas was strong, overall sales in November and December were 
'disappointing', as it refused to discount stock and maintained its 
profit margins.

But more people left their shopping until after Christmas when Next put on a high profile sale, which it said 'went well'.

Next,
 which has been one of the best-performing stocks in the FTSE 100 Index 
over the past year, saw shares slump 5 per cent. Rival Marks & 
Spencer fell 2 per cent.

The group narrowed its full-year 
profits guidance to £7million either side of £565 million, compared to 
£551million a year earlier.

However, it said profits next year would only show a slight improvement amid challenging conditions for consumers.

John Lewis’s  strongest sellers included iPads and Kindles, cashmere sweaters and bedding and linen.

The period saw it smash its previous weekly sales record, when it took £133.1 million in the seven days to December 17.

However, it has seen a fall in sales 
in the week after Christmas as it came up against strong comparisons 
with the year before when people rushed to buy big ticket items ahead of
 the hike in VAT to 20 per cent.

Managing director Andy Street said: 'Sales during the four weeks to Christmas Eve were outstanding.'

John Lewis's pre-Christmas sales were
 also flattered by softer figures from last year when the Arctic weather
 kept shoppers at home.

Perfumes proved a popular gift ahead 
of Christmas and accounted for half of all beauty sales in one week. The
 group said it sold enough Chanel No 5 and Coco Mademoiselle to fill 
3,600 champagne glasses.

Next had enjoyed a strong year until the pre-Christmas slump

Other popular gifts included lingerie, speciality chocolate and Champagne.

Sales of toys were strong, with a storage unit shaped like a giant Lego 
man's head and Hexbug mini-robotic creatures among the favourites.

Baking gadgets and brightly coloured 
kitchen utensils such as cookie cutters, measures and cupcake cases and 
pudding bowls were also snapped up.

And sales of boys' and girls' hats, gloves and scarves and snowboots benefited from the recent cold snap.

Its post-Christmas sale has seen 
strong demand for laptops, TVs, Apple MacBooks, Dyson vacuum cleaners, 
iPod speakers and homewares such as mattresses and duvets.

Meanwhile, Matthew McEachran, an 
analyst at Singer Capital Markets, said the weaker-than-expected 
performance from Next may lead the City to downgrade its profits 
forecasts by 3 per cent.

But Next had some good news for consumers as it confirmed that it does not expect to hike prices over the coming year.

The group last year openly passed on price rises, such as the soaring cost of cotton, to shoppers as it maintained its margins.

It predicted that the squeeze on consumers will ease this year, with inflation dropping close to average wage growth.

But it warned that the eurozone crisis and rising unemployment would continue to drag on confidence.

The group said its stock levels at Christmas were 10 per cent higher than a year ago, reflecting the weak festive trade.

But the strong post-Christmas sale, 
which saw consumers queuing outside stores across the country after many
 of its goods were reduced to half price or less, was expected to help 
shift the stock.

It said: 'A number of factors have 
subdued sales in the final quarter and it is hard to judge to what 
extent warm winter weather and higher levels of competitor discounting 
masked the deeper, longer-lasting economic effects.'

As a result, it was cautious about 
its performance over the coming year, but said it expected to generate 
£200million surplus cash to return to shareholders.
