Coffee connoisseurs can relax knowing their beans will be brewed in the correct way with the help of a new iPhone app.

The free app is a timer that advises people how long to brew certain types of beans, how much water to use and even when to stir the coffee.

It lets coffee fans perfect the brewing process and then save their tweaks in the app so they can create their ideal cup again and again.

Improving the daily grind: Brewseful is a free iPhone app (pictured) that advises people how long to brew certain types of coffee beans, how much water to use and even when to stir the coffee. It is largely a complex timer that walks people through the process using sound alerts

The Brewseful app is designed for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy using different varieties of ground beans and waiting for their beverage - not for people who are content with adding boiling water to a teaspoon of instant coffee.

It firstly lets people calculate the ratio of water to ground beans needed, and set times reminding them when to pour in the water.

It can also be used to discover how long to let the mixture steep, according to its Baltimore-based creator, Kevin Zweerink, who is a graphic design student at the Maryland Institute College of Art.

To begin the process, connoisseurs need to select which type of bean they are using as well as the coarseness of the grind and the size of their cup, to work out the best coffee-to-water ratio.

On track for the best brew: To get started, people have to enter what type of beans they are using and can save their favourites (pictured left). The app lets them create timers for each brew to use while making their cup of 
coffee (right) so that it can beep when they need to move onto 
the next step, ensuring precision

A recent 
study has revealed that regardless of how precisely a person makes their
 coffee, the brew releases more flavour if they gulp it down.

Scientists said that taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly.

They looked at ‘sip volume’ when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a ‘higher aroma release’.

The
 researchers said: ‘The findings could be useful to understand the 
factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of 
coffee.’ 

However,
 the advice goes against that for other drinks, such as wine, where 
people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the 
maximum flavour and aroma.

The app then generates a time for how long the process will take.

Users can set alarms to remind them when to start pouring in water and when to stir, for example.

‘Large numbers, clear alert sounds, and a bold progress indicator make it easy to keep your attention on your coffee,’ according to the App Store.

Because users can customise the process for a certain type of coffee, they can explore the subtle science of getting the best out of beans and make tiny tweaks to each cup they make until they reach the perfect formula.

'I came up with the idea for Brewseful 
when I was just starting to become interested in nice coffee,' Zweerink told MailOnline.

'I was 
using the regular stopwatch app on my phone, but I wanted a more 
specialised timer that could help keep track of all the different 
parameters that go into a really solid cup, something that would allow 
me to make small tweaks and gradual improvements each time I brewed.'

He does not think that his app will change the way people drink coffee, but he doesn't want it to, as he likes the way people have personalised rituals for making a cup.

'I hope that Brewseful can play a small part in keeping track of the details and help people find what tastes best for them,' he said.

'One of my favourite things about brewing my own coffee is the eclectic collection of objects that I get to interact with, all of which fit together not because they were designed as a system, but because they were designed with a common goal.

'I wanted to make a timer that works alongside any given brewing method, that addresses the concerns of making coffee rather than the concerns of doing so in any particular manner.'
