Only a few months ago she was acting in front of tiny audiences in schools and village halls.

But last night disabled actress Nicola Miles-Wildin was centre-stage at the Paralympics opening ceremony.

Playing the part of Miranda from The Tempest, the actress guided millions of viewers through the opening ceremony using the words of Shakespeare.

She started the show by delivering the famous lines: ‘O wonder! How many goodly creatures there are here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, that has such people in’t!’

The 34-year-old wheelchair user, who 
has juvenile chronic arthritis, was the central protagonist during the 
dazzling three-hour journey of discovery which organisers said was 
focused on the themes of ‘empowerment and enlightenment’.

In the moments before the Paralympic flame was lit, Miss Miles-Wildin, from Gloucester, took to the skies in a segment showing Miranda’s journey of enlightenment reaching its conclusion as she was seen smashing through a ‘glass ceiling’ with her walking stick.

She later returned to the stadium, transformed into a 'giant library', alongside Sir Ian McKellen to recite more words from The Tempest.

She then boarded a giant upturned umbrella boat - reminiscent of Winnie the Pooh - for an ensemble dance routine with hundreds of other performers.

One of her most memorable moments came when she took a bite from an apple she found in a maze, prompting all 62,000 spectators to do the same to make the world's largest apple bite.

Previously the actress’s biggest roles had been in productions for Radio 4.

Speaking
before the ceremony, the theatre and media drama graduate from the 
University of Glamorgan admitted she was ‘very nervous’ about taking to 
such a big stage.

She did 
not even tell her parents she was auditioning for the part, which she 
secured two months ago after an audition and screen test.

She said: ‘I’m used to working in theatres and small-scale touring in village halls and schools.

‘This
is the biggest gig I have ever done. Miranda appears all the way 
through the ceremony.

'The last time I did Shakespeare was at school. 
It’s a massive part and I’ve already started having anxiety dreams.

'There will be 80,000 people in the stadium – I’m trying not to think 
about it.'

She added: ‘I’ve 
had to keep it all secret. I’ve not been able to share details.

'But it 
will be an amazing spectacle. It’s the Paralympics – of course it will 
be bigger and better than the Olympics'

Symbolic: The disabled actress descended into the stadium above the dancers and a giant apple symbolising Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity

Wonderful: Miss Miles-Wildin delivers the famous lines: 'O wonder!How many goodly creatures there are here! How beauteous mankind is!'

Miss Miles-Wildin is an assistant artist with the Graeae Theatre Company, Britain’s only full-time professional theatre company made up of disabled people.

She can also be spotted performing at festivals with wheelchair line-dancing troupe The Rhinestone Rollers.

As she descended into the stadium, a giant apple rolled into the arena with another wheelchair-bound theatre designer  named Jo Paul.

She was one of 42 disabled and deaf people who took part in a training programme at Circus Space in London funded by the Arts council to allow them to take part in the opening ceremony.

Fight for the right: Miss Paul, who has a masters in dance and in scenography and speaks Spanish, said she believed disabled people 'have to work harder and fight louder and longer to gain the respect of others'

They learnt circus, aerial and other performance skills in preparation for the opening ceremony.

Ms Paul, a 43-year-old theatre designer from Hackney, was one of 42 disabled and deaf people who took part in a Circus skills training programme funded by the Arts council to allow them to take part in the opening ceremony.

Miss Paul, who has a masters in dance and in scenography and speaks Spanish, said she believed disabled people ‘have to work harder and fight louder and longer to gain the respect of others.’

On her blog, she writes: 'Sometimes it easier to keep your head down and do the work you enjoy quietly rather than confront the attitude of others.

'The ego of others and the disbelief others can have in you because of a multitude of assumptions made by society about disabled and deaf people. People are surprised by the amount of experience I have when it accidentally comes up in conversation.'
