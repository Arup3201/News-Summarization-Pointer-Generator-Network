The upstate New York school bus monitor who was bullied by four seventh-graders says she's satisfied that they're being suspended for a year.

Speaking one day after the boys' punishment was announced, Karen Klein told The Associated Press on Saturday that she wants to meet with the boys who tormented her.

"Oh yes, I would like to talk to them!" said the 68-year-old, speaking from her home in Rochester. "I want to ask them why they did it."

Retiring: Bus monitor Karen Klein, who was cruelly bullied by four seventh-graders,  says she is planning to retire

What the four boys did was captured on
 video, mercilessly taunting Klein as she sat on the bus, gradually 
breaking down in tears.

On Friday, the school system in the 
Rochester suburb of Greece suspended the four middle school students for
 a year, keeping them from regular bus transportation.

How does Klein feel about this punishment?

"It's fine with me," she told the AP.

Klein said they'll still be going to an alternative school - "they won't be just sitting at home doing nothing."

But the best part of her ordeal going 
public, and the resulting school action, "is that they have to do 
community service - for senior citizens," she said, her voice rising 
with emotion.

"I'm so glad everyone out there knows 
about this," she added, sounding upbeat as she spoke to the AP minutes 
after returning from Boston and a much needed, four-day vacation that 
followed the flurry of attention raining on her from across the country.

Tormented: Klein, 68, was taunted and 
tormented by the middle school students in Greece, New York in a 
difficult-to-watch 10-minute video. She can be seen wiping away her tears in the footage

Unacceptable: At one point, a student says: 'If I
 stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like 
butter, because itâ€™s all f***** lard'

Klein, who is hard of hearing, spoke 
by telephone with the help of her adult son and daughter, who repeated 
questions that she then answered herself.

Another benefit of the video of the 
incident going viral, she said, "is that it's putting people into 
action, making them talk to their children, making them teach them what 
they should not do."

The cellphone video posted online by a
 fellow student drew millions of viewers. The video shows Klein trying 
her best to ignore a stream of profanity, insults and outright threats.

One student taunted: "You don't have a
 family because they all killed themselves because they don't want to be
 near you." Klein's oldest son killed himself 10 years ago.

Among the mounds of messages she received this week were letters of apology from three of the boys and their families.

She said earlier in the week that she didn't feel the youths were sincere.

But on Saturday, Klein said she accepts the newest letter she received several days ago - from the fourth boy.

His parents dropped it off with flowers.

"He said he was sorry, and that he didn't mean to do it," Klein said. "And I think he means it."

Sounding relieved, she said that none 
of the students will be showing up on her school bus in the fall - 
should she choose to return to work.

The support she's received wasn't only verbal.

A fund drive that began with a goal of $5,000 to help Klein take a nice vacation raised more than $667,000 as of Friday.

She hasn't decided yet whether to return to her job

"I don't know, I just don't know," she said, adding, "I'm going to invest and I don't need to work."

But Klein, a grandmother of eight, including one with Down syndrome, said she'll donate part of the money to support research.

And she wants to pay off all her bills.

Doubt: She also said she didn't believe that the boys' apologies were sincere
