One of the hottest properties in the Football League Moses Odubajo has left Leyton Orient to sign for Brentford.

The winger, who was a standout performer for Russell Slade’s side in their failed League One promotion push last season, has signed a three-year deal at Griffin Park. 

Sportsmail understands the Championship side have paid the O’s in the region of £1million plus additional clauses - even though the player was out of contract at Brisbane Road this time next year.

Odubajo had been touted as a potential capture for Premier League clubs earlier this summer and represents a real coup for Brentford, who earned promotion alongside Wolves last season.

The 20-year-old is a lively wide man, scoring in Orient’s play-off final defeat against Rotherham United at Wembley.

Brentford mean business as they embark on their first campaign in the second tier for 21 years, having already landed former Real Madrid midfielder Marcos Tebar Ramiro, although they have lost striker Clayton Donaldson to Birmingham City.

Potential: Brentford boss Mark Warburton is excited about the future with Odubajo at the club

Talking on Odubajo, Bees manager Mark Warburton said: ‘We have been very impressed with his quality and his consistency.

‘Moses is a young player with a lot of development potential. I am sure he will prove to be an exciting addition.’
