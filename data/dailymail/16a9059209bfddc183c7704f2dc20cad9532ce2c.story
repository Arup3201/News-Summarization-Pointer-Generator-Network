As a new sex allegation threatens to unravel Herman Cain's White House bid, an ex-business partner of his accuser today shedding new light on the woman's past.

Atlanta businesswoman Ginger White came forward last night during a TV interview to reveal that she has carried on a 13-is an unemployed single mother-of-two with numerous evictions on her record - including one just this month.

She also had a protection order sought against her by an ex-business partner, Kimberly Vay.

Rethinking? Cain told senior staffers today that he will review the campaign's strategy over the next several days

Miss
Vay is a competitive body builder and a behavioural health specialist 
who last year started No Limit Cycling with Ms White - in which the two 
women taught spin classes.

But
somewhere along the way, their business relationship soured, with Miss 
Vay seeking a 'stalking protective order' after Ms White sent out a 
defamatory email about her in December, according to Miss Vay's lawyer, 
Kurt Martin.

Miss Vay accused Ms White of sending her repeated emails and texts threatening a lawsuit, as well as defamation of character.

While
that case was later dropped, Miss Vay then filed a libel lawsuit on 
June 9 and won after Ms White never responded to the case.

The case will now go to a jury to decide a dollar amount for damages.

Meanwhile, Cain told staffers today that he's reassessing his campaign a day after Atlanta businesswoman Ginger White alleged a 13-year extramarital affair with the Republican.

He has fiercely denied the affair as well as several other accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour that have surfaced over the past month and he has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race.

Coming forward: Ms White, an Atlanta businesswoman, she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story first

'Here we go again': Herman Cain went on TV to deny the allegations that he had an affair... before they fully emerged

He told senior staff in a mid-morning conference call lasting roughly 10 minutes that all public events will go forward this week but he will review the campaign's strategy over the next several days.

One participant on the call, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the conversation, said that as part of that assessment, Cain's campaign is examining the impact of the newest allegations.

This person described the tone as positive but also said there was some uncertainty coming from Cain.

'He said obviously it's taken an emotional toll on his family, but he's moving ahead with the campaign,' said Steve Grubbs, Cain's Iowa campaign chairman. 'He said that they will be reassessing the campaign.'

Grubbs added: 'He said this lady was a friend, someone he thought was a friend, that he was trying to help out financially and had been a friend for some period of time. But that nothing inappropriate occurred.'

When asked about the libel case and its impact on her accusations against Cain, Ms White said: 'Well, because I admit it. Whatever happened with Kim and I - um - happened.

'Just as, what, what, there would make no sense to come out with these allegations against Herman if it absolutely wasn't true.'

Ms White’s attorney told WAGA that she didn’t respond because to the case because she thought it had already been settled.

Also, in 2001, she filed a sexual harassment claim against her former employer, which was later settled.

Standing by her man: Herman Cain's wife Gloria, who married him in 1968, has been consistent in her support for her husband

Going on: Mr Cain said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her

Mr Cain denied the affair, but a statement from his attorney side-steps the question entirely by claiming the allegations are not a matter open for public scrutiny.

But they represent the most serious claims yet against Mr Cain, who has been accused of sexual harassment against four other women.

And Mr Cain began defending himself 
before the allegations even surfaced. He broke the news himself on CNN 
that Ms White would make claims against him.

'This appears to be an accusation of 
private, alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter 
which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public,' 
said a statement from Mr Cain's lawyer.

The statement, however, does not explicitly deny the affair.

In an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta yesterday, Ms White said she was only coming forward because she was afraid
someone would tell her story before she herself could.

'I'm not proud,' she said. 'I did not want to do this. I did not.'

Mr Cain has been accused of sexual 
harassment by four other women, two of whom have come forward publicly 
with their allegations.

As well as an alleged relationship with Ginger White, Mr Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women:

However, to this point, the only 
accusations were about inappropriate advances or comments. Ms White is 
saying he cheated on his wife for more than a decade

'It was pretty simple. It wasn't complicated,' she told the local TV station. 'I was aware that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very inappropriate situation, relationship.'

Mr Cain has been married to his wife Gloria since 1968. Both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment.

And Mr Cain's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete. 

'I
just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up, "Here 
we go again,"' he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Situation Room.

The Georgia native said he knew the woman as an 'acquaintance who I thought
was a friend.'

He denied having an affair, instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems.

Cain also deflected criticism 
and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him
out of office.

As proof of the lengthy relationship, Ms White offered her mobile phone, which has Mr Cain's private number.

Ms White also showed mobile phone 
records dating back four months that have 61 phone calls and text 
messages to or from Mr Cain as early as 4.26am and as late as 7.52pm.

'He made it very intriguing,' Ms White 
told FOX 5. 'It was fun. It was something that took me away from my 
humdrum life at the time. And it was exciting.'

Ms White said the two met in 
Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s when Mr Cain was the president 
of the National Restaurant Association.

That night, she says, Mr Cain took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room.

'I'd
like to see you again. You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us
to continue this friendship,' Ms White claims Mr Cain told her.

From then, he paid for her to fly to his
speaking engagements across the country, where he put her up in fancy 
hotels and restaurants like the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons.
