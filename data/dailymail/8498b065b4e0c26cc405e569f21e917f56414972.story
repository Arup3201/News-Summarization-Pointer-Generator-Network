Jailed: Jack Watchorn, nicknamed the 'Creeper, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison

A teenage girl was stalked and kidnapped by a 6ft 6 giant nicknamed the 'Creeper' as she walked home alone for the first time.

The petite girl, 17, who is just 5ft tall, was just yards from her front door when she was grabbed from behind and dragged into an alleyway by 22-year-old Jack Watchorn.

Bespectacled Watchorn, who had begun following the girl late at night after she left her friend's house, clamped his hand over her mouth and pulled her backwards in what a female judge branded an attack 'every woman dreads'.

He then hit her in the face before fleeing from the alleyway in Blackpool, Lancashire.

Passers by heard the teenager's screams, before finding her hysterical, crying: 'some sicko has just hit me.'

The girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was so traumatised by the abduction she now now fears going out at night.

She also has nightmares about men wearing glasses bursting through her bedroom window.

Watchorn, who is taking part in a scheme with The Prince's Trust, was jailed for 30 months for kidnap at Preston Crown Court.

The court heard that the girl had been at a friend’s house before making her way home alone at 10pm on January 20 this year. 

She was just yards from her front door when Watchorn - who moved to the UK from native Galway in Ireland - ran across the road towards her.

Scene: Watchorn, 22, grabbed his 17-year-old victim as she was walking along this street in Blackpool, Lancashire (pictured), before dragging her into an alleyway and hitting her

Roger Brown, prosecuting, said: 'What is important, having watched the video of the way in which the defendant followed the young woman, is that he is gradually catching up with her.

'She turns off the main road and the defendant runs across the road and takes hold of her.'

CCTV footage captured the moment Watchorn clamped his hand over the young woman's mouth, before dragging her into the alleyway.

He then ran off to a nearby pizza parlour and was arrested eight days later.

The victim, who is undergoing counselling, said in a statement that her social life had suffered and she constantly looks over her shoulder.

She added: 'I wish it had never happened, I think about it every day.'

The court heard that Watchorn of Bond Street, Blackpool, had convictions for theft, threatening and abusive behaviour and being intoxicated in a public place between 2008 and 2010.

Philip Andrews, defending, said: 'He pursued her, effectively stalked her over a considerable distance and over a number of minutes. He is 6ft 6 and she is only about 5ft.

'He was extremely drunk and behaved badly towards this girl and put her in a very frightening situation.

'It couldn’t have lasted more than four or five seconds at the absolute most. He came across this young woman, behaved the way he did, she screamed and he let go.'

Sentencing Watchorn to 30 months in prison, Judge Heather Lloyd said: 'It is very rare for a woman to be taken and abducted in the street by a total stranger, she will have been extremely frightened, it is what every woman dreads and she is no exception.

'She said she thought she was going to die and didn’t want to think what you were going to do to her. She has been left scared and will not go out on her own.'

Speaking afterwards. the victim's mother said: 'It was the first time she had ever walked home on her own and she tried to keep to the main roads to be safe, until the last moment. She wasn’t far from home at all.

'I would have obviously liked him to get longer as any mother would. She is serving a life sentence so why shouldn’t he.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
