Maintenance staff at the world's largest hydroelectric plant show they have a head for heights as they get to work.

But these brave employees at the famed Three Gorges Dam insist their job is nothing out of the ordinary, despite the heart-stopping scenery below them.  

Ensuring electricity is safely transported across the massive power lines to the rest of the country is no easy task and certainly not one for the faint-hearted.

Don't look dow: Employees at the famed Three Gorges Dam insist their job is nothing out of the ordinary

Dizzy: The maintenance workers regularly take on tasks at more than 650 feet above the ground

Daredevils: Ho Ku, one of the workers, said: 'I know it looks impressive but to be honest you don't really think about it when you're up there'

The daredevils criss-cross high above giant rivers, regularly working at more than 650 feet in the air in the process, reports the People's Daily Online.

Ho Ku, 39, is one of the fearless workers involved in the job - and modestly insists it's just another day in the office when he gets started.

He said: 'I know it looks pretty impressive but to be honest you don't really think about it when you're up there. It's just a job like any other.'

The dam that spans the Yangtze River in the Chinese city of Zhongxiang generated an incredible 85 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power last year - enought to power the whole of the UK for about five months - and project managers expect even more to be produced this year. 

The local power company has a small army of technicians responsible for the maintenance of more than 300 electricity pylons that carry power from the dam and supply local requirements. 

The company does annual checks looking for problems every year, typically in spring when staff require a total of 10 days to visit each of the huge pylons and check the cables.

A company spokesman said in that time a total of 338 five-hundred-kilovolt pylons will be serviced, covering an area of approximately 84 miles. 

The electricity pylons in the region that extend across rivers and valleys and transport hydroelectric power are part of the backbone of the central Chinese power grid system, which supplies both the north and south of the country.

More than 330 electricity pylons have to be serviced every year, with some measuring 650ft (200 metres) tall
