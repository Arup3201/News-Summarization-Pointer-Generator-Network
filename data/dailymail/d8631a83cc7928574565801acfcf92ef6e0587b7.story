Dutch legend Johan Cruyff has defended Liverpool's misfiring striker Mario Balotelli, claiming the Italian is not to blame for his poor attitude.

Balotelli, whose on-field demeanor is often criticised by fans and who has fallen out with several managers during his career, is yet to score a Premier League goal since joining the Anfield club for £16million this summer.

But Cruyff believes the fault lies with his clubs, who have not educated him properly. 

Mario Balotelli has had a difficult time  since joining Liverpool in the summer, and is yet to score a league goal

Johan Cruyff says Balotelli's lack of education is to blame for his wayward attitude, on and off the pitch

'What I think about Balotelli as a player and as a man?' Cruyff asked Italian paper Gazzetta dello Sport. 

'We always talk about the person, I prefer to talk about education of the person. Balotelli doesn't behave well and we have to ask why.

The Italian striker has had high-profile fallings out with several managers, including Roberto Mancini at City

Balotelli broke through at Inter Milan when he was just 18, but has struggled to live up to expectations

'To me, if someone is not educated, he doesn't play. To me, it is not fault of the player, but of the team that makes him play. The problem is not Mario, but the education that was given to him.

'If he had been educated in a certain way, he wouldn't behave this way.'
