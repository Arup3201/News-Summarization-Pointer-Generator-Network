Tottenham have turned their attentions to tying Jan Vertonghen to a new contract after safeguarding Hugo Lloris' future.

The defender still has two years to run on his current deal, but preliminary talks over an extension for the Belgium international have started.

Spurs want to avoid the prospect of Vertonghen going into the final year of his deal and have stepped up their attempts to sign him to fresh terms.

Priority: Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is keen to renew Vertonghen's contract at White Hart Lane

International: Vertonghen was part of the Belgium team that reached the World Cup quarter-finals

Fans' favourite: The Belgian defender scored the winner in their World Cup game against South Korea

Spurs will offer Vertonghen a new five-year contract, which will include a pay increase from his current Â£45,000-per-week deal.

Vertonghen has become an integral member of the White Hart Lane side's squad since his arrival from Ajax in 2012.

Signing Vertonghen and Lloris to new long-term deals are among chairman Daniel Levy's summer priorities.

And with Lloris now signed for another five years, Tottenham are hopeful of persuading Vertonghen to follow suit.

Friend or foe: Vertonghen tries to steal the ball from his Belgium team-mate Kevin Mirallas

Rivals: The versatile defender tussles with Olivier Giroud during a north London derby last year
