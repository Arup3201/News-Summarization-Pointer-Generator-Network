Virginia Water in Surrey has become the first place outside London where house prices average more than £1million.

And with its stunning lake views, commuting distance from London and the exclusive Wentworth Golf Club, it’s not hard to see why.

But buyers hoping to join the likes of Sir Bruce Forsyth, Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Elton John – who have all bought properties in the sought-after location – will have to fork out more than £1million for the privilege.

Property bubble: The leafy village of Virginia Water in Surrey now has an average house price of more than £1million

Attractive: Within an easy commute of central London and close to Heathrow and private schools, Virginia Water is a popular residential area

Millionaires' club: Property prices in Virginia Water have risen 6 per cent in the last year

The town, which has just 3,000 residents, has the most expensive homes in the UK, according to property website Zoopla.

Property prices have risen by 6 per cent in Virginia Water, whose average price of £1.03million makes it £200,000 more expensive than the second most expensive place, Cobham, also in Surrey.

1. Virginia Water, Surrey                £1,034,368

2. Cobham, Surrey                         £842, 806

3. Beaconsfield, Bucks                   £806, 459

4. Keston, Kent                               £785,399

5. Esher, Surrey                              £774, 779

The Property Rich List shows Britain’s most expensive street is once again Kensington Palace Gardens, West London, with an average price of £36million – which is 156 times the cost of an average British home.

Close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home at Kensington Palace, the road has previously been nicknamed the Boulevard of Billionaires.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax Bank, said: ‘In London, when you are talking about real prime areas, it’s foreign buyers who have been coming in and looking to invest.

'They see it as a haven. But places like Virginia Water are prosperous areas too.’

Charming: Virginia Water still retains its villagey atmosphere, despite the influx of wealth into the town

Not all the houses in Virginia Water are worth millions, but their price is pushed up by the area average

Lawrence Hall, spokesman for Zoopla, 
said: ‘Only the super-wealthy can entertain the notion of living on the 
most expensive streets and they are paying as much for the address and 
the location as they are for the size and quality of the property.

'You can find magnificent mansions in
 other parts of the country for a similar price to even just average 
properties in areas like Kensington.

Zoopla’s report conﬁrmed the gulf between property values in the north and the south of the UK housing market.

Britain’s ten most sought-after streets are in London. Of the 8,230 streets in the UK where the average property value is more than £1million, only a quarter – 2,064 – are outside the South East.

The cheapest street in Britain is Merryﬁeld Court in Skegness, with homes valued at little more than £31,000.

The Zoopla report also revealed that there are a record number of British ‘property millionaires’.

Top of the pile: Kensington Palace Gardens in West London remains the most expensive street in Britain with an average house price of £36million

Here are Britain’s most expensive streets, with the average property value:1. Kensington Palace Gardens, London W8, £36,066,1482. The Boltons, London SW10, £23,375,7583. Grosvenor Crescent, London SW1X, £19,768,9634. Courtenay Avenue, London N6, £10,750,3365. Compton Avenue, London N6, £10,006,0146. Frognal Way, London NW3, £9,513,7167. Park Place Villas, London W2, £8,980,4778. Montrose Place, London SW1X, £8,980,4689. Cottesmore Gardens, London W8, £8,813,42910. Palace Green, London W8, £8,644,535

Nearly 325,000 homes are worth more than £1million – up by 80 per cent in four years and by a third in just 12 months.

The scale of the increase in ‘property millionaires’ is eye-watering.

In 2009, there were 183,630, but the number has jumped by nearly 80 per cent to reach the all-time high of 323,684 today.

In the last 12 months alone, Britain added 78,000 new 'property millionaires' - an average of 1,500 a week.

Many homeowners bought their property for a fraction of the current value decades ago and now discover to their delight that it is worth a seven-figure sum.

But many others are not so lucky. Their home may be worth more than £1million, but they have a super-size mortgage which means they have very little equity in the property.

In a further sign that the market is gathering pace, average UK prices have gone up to £168,941, marking the strongest year-on-year uplift seen since September 2010.

New figures from Nationwide reveal that on a month-on-month basis, house prices rose by 0.3% in June, marking a slight slowdown compared with a 0.4% rise recorded the previous month.

The building society said that Government efforts to kickstart the market, as well as a lack of available homes to buy, are helping to bolster house prices.

However, there are big regional divides.

Prices in London now stand at a new all-time high at an average £318,214, which is 5% above their previous 2007 peak.

Nationwide’s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said London 'has seen the greatest recovery in prices of any region'.

By contrast, prices across the UK are still around 9% below their pre-crisis peak. Prices in England are currently 5% lower than those seen in 2007, while they are 13% down in Wales, 12% lower in Scotland and have plummeted by 53% in Northern Ireland compared with their 2007 levels.

Ten out of 13 areas across the UK have seen house prices increase over the last year, while three - Scotland, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and Humberside - have seen falls.

Among England’s cities outside London, Newcastle saw the biggest housing market jump year on year, with prices up by 11% to reach £173,296 on average, while Liverpool saw the biggest annual drop, with an 8% slide taking prices to around £142,454.

A string of recent studies have pointed to signs that the housing market is picking up, helped by Government initiatives such as Funding for Lending, which gives lenders access to cheap finance and has prompted a sharp increase in mortgage availability as well as lenders slashing their rates.

Virginia Water is said to have been named after Elizabeth I who was known as the Virgin Queen

The first village outside London where the average house price is more than £1million, Virginia Water has a population of 6,113.

Made up of a series of private roads set around the four golf courses of the Wentworth Club, it is said to take its name after Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen.

In truth, a cool million would probably buy you very little. Several of the palatial mansions, complete with marble kitchens and indoor pools, can go for upward of £10million.

Within easy reach of central London, Heathrow and some of the most elite private schools in the country, it has been a popular retreat of the rich and famous since the Twenties.

These days, such is the high value of land on the estate, many are bought to be demolished and replaced by a new-build.

‘It’s surrounded by greenbelt so there’s no new land to be had,’ says Ken Reay, of Queensgate Corporation.

‘The only option to build a new home is to buy an old one, knock it down and put one up on the site. In the past decade, land values have doubled to around £2 million per acre.’

The estate was once the preserve of golfing royalty - Ernie Elsa and Nick Faldo have both owned properties - but is now becoming increasingly popular with foreign buyers.

Virginia Waters hit the headlines in 1998 when General Augusto Pinochet was placed under house arrest in one its mansions prior to his extradition.

More recently, it was the setting for the dramatic death of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky.

Other famous residents include  ex-Formula 1 team owner Eddie Jordan, Sir Elton John and boxer Prince Naseem.
