Three women who escaped from Warren Jeffs' polygamous sect have revealed what life was like in a world controlled by the convicted pedophile's bizarre rules issued from prison.

Twins Heidi and Helen Holm, along with their friend Allie Steed, spent two years living in the claustrophobic world enforced by Warren Jeffs' brother Lyle until they could take no more and fled.

Jeffs tightened his regime and expelled many members, including the twins' father, from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Colorado City, Arizona.

Terrorized: Female members of the FLDS Church. Three young women have spoken out about their time living in convicted pedophile Warren Jeffs polygamous sect

Jeffs, 56, last year was convicted of sexually assaulting two minors whom he described as his spiritual wives and is serving a life sentence in a Texas prison

Allie Holm, now 23, told the Salt Lake Tribune: 'It's like a cloud comes down around you. I couldn’t even breathe.'

In June, Warren Jeffs issued a command to his sect - the names of 15 men he has chosen to father all future children of his church. He declared all marriages void until he can return and 'seal' them.

Jeffs,
 56, last year was convicted of sexually assaulting two minors whom he 
described as his spiritual wives. At trial, prosecutors presented DNA 
evidence to show he fathered a child with one of those girls, aged 15. He
 is serving a life in a Texas prison.

Among the men that were banished was the twins' father Lorin Holm. Lyle Jeffs told Mr Holm that in the eyes of God, he was no longer a father and husband to his family and that he had to leave. Mr Holm left his wives and children to set up home in Nevada.

Prior to this in 2011, Warren's brother Lyle Jeffs had interviewed each member of 
the Church for a 'new United Order' - telling around 1,000 people that 
they were not good enough and must leave.

The conditions in the FLDS were severe - unmarried
 women were not allowed cellphones or jobs where they interacted with 
outsiders. Children were forced to give away toys and hair ribbons and clasps were banned.

Wake-up calls were issued for 5am, women were given reusable feminine hygiene products and only allowed to clean their homes with soap and water. All members were under constant surveillance by the church elders.

The response from his congregation 
was polarizing and families began fleeing the church. The twins' mother, also called Helen, left to join their father in Nevada.

The young women found themselves rebelling, driving to Walmart to buy toiletries, the Tribune reported.

The last straw came when they were forced to attend a seven-hour church meeting where Warren Jeffs edicts were recited and members had to denounce those who had left the church. Heidi was the first to leave followed shortly afterwards by her twin Helen.

Allie Steed managed to escape two weeks ago with the help of the Holm twins after sending a frantic text message to her friends.

Two days later, the twins showed up in their car at the home in Kansas where Allie had been taken by their father and escaped while he was at work.

The three young women joined the hundreds of others who were kicked out of Jeffs' organization or simply walked away. They have rejoined a world where cellphones and even boyfriends are now allowed without question or repercussions.

However
 despite their new-found freedom, there was a great deal to leave 
behind. The young women described happy childhoods in Jeffs' church and 
find it hard to believe that the same man, who taught them at an FLDS 
school, committed sex crimes.  They have also lost many friends and family who consider them outcasts.

The young women are now living with Lorin Holm and first wife Helen in Nevada where they have swapped their prairie dressed for conservative but more mainstream clothes.

They have high school educations and plan to get jobs. All three young women want to get married and have children but in the meantime. the focus is on 'living life and being happy'.
