How the game will be won

Brace yourself, Honduras. The French have a powerhouse midfield with plenty of options. Didier Deschamps favours a midfield three because the players he has at his disposal are flexible, fast and fluid.

Expect them to switch positions regularly but keep the balance between attack and defence just right.

One to watch: Paul Pogba (France)

Man Utd will be kicking themselves for letting Paul Pogba go. He was instrumental in Juventus winning Serie A and is now an all-action midfielder.

Familiar face

Hull fans will know all about Maynor Figueroa but the Honduran defender is better known for scoring a stunner from his own half for Wigan against Stoke five years ago.

History lesson

Since 1998, the French have not scored in their opening game of a World Cup. Honduras have not scored in their last four World Cup matches.

Did you know?

This will be the first meeting between the two.

Familiar: Hull City's Maynor Figueroa will be one of Honduras' best known players
