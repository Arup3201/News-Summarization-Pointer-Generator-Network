Muhammad Ali has been taken to hospital after falling unconscious at home just days after his frail appearance at a funeral for Joe Frazier.

A spokesman for the boxing legend said Ali was only hospitalised for treatment of dehydration and that 'early reports were blown out of proportion.'

Ali was last seen in public at a Philadelphia service for his fellow boxing legend on November 14, but a woman called 911 for him five days later.

Boxing great: Muhammad Ali was last seen in public at a Philadelphia service for Joe Frazier on November 14, but a woman called 911 for him five days later

The call came from the 6,000 sq ft 
estate he shares with wife Yolanda in Paradise Valley, Arizona, reported
Star magazine and RadarOnline.

The 69-year-old has suffered from Parkinson’s disease for 27 years and was taken to Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center.

‘The victim started to pass out in the car and when they got him into the house he fell unconscious,’ a Paradise Valley Police spokesman told Star.

‘The 911 tape was filled with details of prescriptions and medical details about the victim who was suffering from an on-going medical condition.’

Spokesman Craig Bankey said in statement Ali was resting at his home and recovering from the hospital stay.

Future worries: Fears were raised about his health after he appeared very frail at a two-hour service in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, last month

Ali spent the Thanksgiving weekend across the other side of the U.S. in Las Vegas, Nevada, with his family, reported Star.

A source close to Ali told Star he has had various medical specialists in Phoenix so the family must have ‘really been scared’ to have called 911.

Fears were raised about his health after he appeared very frail at a two-hour service at the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, last month.

According to U.S. showbusiness website RadarOnline, friends fear that he may not live long into next year.

Reverend Jesse Jackson asked mourners to rise and clap for the former heavyweight champion Frazier, who handed Ali his first loss in 1971.

A weak and trembling Ali, wearing a dark suit and sunglasses, rose from his seat at the service and energetically applauded his rival ‘Smokin' Joe’.

Ali’s relatives and friends have told Star he may only have months left to live, but still enjoys spending time with his grandchildren.

However, Jeanie Kahnke, a spokeswoman for the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, says she spoke with Ali's wife, Lonnie, by phone Friday morning and that 'he was right next to her asking for breakfast and that he was doing good.'

Widely-seen as the best sportsman of all time, Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr in Louisville, Kentucky, and won an Olympic gold in 1960.

Ali married his fourth wife and childhood friend Yolanda in 1986 and they have had one son, Asaad. In total, Ali has seven daughters and two sons.
