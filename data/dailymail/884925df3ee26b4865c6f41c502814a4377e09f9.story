Child survivors of the Holocaust will receive additional financial assistance from the German government to help them cope with problems caused by physical trauma and malnutrition inflicted by the Nazis.

The agreement will provide one-time payments of 2,500 euros - roughly £2,000 - for Jews who were in concentration camps, ghettos or spent at least six months in hiding as children, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.

It represents the first time the German government has recognised the unique problems facing child survivors, said Claims Conference executive vice president Greg Schneider, who was involved in the negotiations.

The German Finance Ministry on Thursday 
confirmed the agreement, which is worth an estimated total £153million, 
but refused to provide further details.

Mr Schneider said: 'All of this is being driven by the fact that we're in the final years.

'If there's going to be any final message that the German government or the German people are going to give to survivors, these are literally the last years to do it.'

Mr Schneider estimated that some 75,000 survivors around the world could qualify for the payments, designed to help them with physical and psychological problems stemming from childhood malnutrition and emotional trauma.

He said that some were witness to 'unimaginable atrocities'.

He said: 'A range of 
injurious experiences has had a cumulative effect ... resulting in 
late-onset problems that are only now manifesting as physical and 
psychological symptoms in the survivors' advanced age.'

He added that as so many survivors lost most, if not all, relatives in the Holocaust, many lack family support in their old age and have no inherited wealth to help them.

The agreement, which still has to be approved by the German Parliament but isn't expected to meet any political resistance, will provide the one-time payment to Nazi victims born January 1 1928 or later. That would have made them at oldest 11 at the start of the war, and 17 by its end.

The payment will come in addition to any other compensation received and the fund is expected to become operational from January 1 2015.

Also starting in January, Germany is providing the Claims Conference with 205 million euros - roughly £198million - to begin paying for home care help for Holocaust victims, according to a previous agreement. An additional 210 million euros will be paid in 2016, and 215 million euros in 2017.

The payments mark the first time Germany has recognised the problems facing child survivors: Above, 1943 file photo, showing a group of Jews, including a small boy, being escorted from the Warsaw Ghetto

In total, Germany has paid around 70 billion euros - £55billion - in compensation for Nazi crimes, primarily to Jewish survivors.

Compensation has evolved continuously since Germany agreed in 1952 to make payments, with annual negotiations between the Claims Conference and the German government on who should receive funds and how much will be paid.

Mr Schneider said: 'There's no amount of money that can ever compensate for what happened to a person during the Holocaust, but even a symbolic acknowledgement is extraordinarily important.'
