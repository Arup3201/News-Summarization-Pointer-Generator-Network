Dawn Simmonds always hated being 'a big girl'. But at 5ft 9in tall and weighing 13½ stone, that was how her friends and family referred to her — until now.

Dawn, 47, lives in London with her husband, Dougie, 48, and their 23-year-old  daughter, Kirsty. She bought the 2-Day Diet book in  February when it was  serialised in the Daily Mail and has stuck to it ever since.

'In the first week I lost 7lb,' she says. 'The change was so dramatic that it was almost frightening.'

She has shed more than 21lb so far and is determined not to stop until she reaches her 11-stone goal.

'In fact, even when I get there I’m not going to stop,' she says. 'This has changed my life and this is how I eat now.'

Her impetus to lose weight came when Dawn was  diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. She had a mastectomy and was told by her GP that if she lost a bit of weight she could reduce the chance of the cancer returning.

'I tried WeightWatchers and Slimming World, but it never worked,' she says.

Dawn works as a printer and the long hours and 6am starts meant she kept up her energy levels with chocolate, crisps and endless rounds of  supermarket sandwiches.

The 2-day diet meant changing her eating habits completely: 'Now I count out 15 squares of chocolate each week and wrap five squares in clingfilm in three portions — that’s my three treats for non-diet days if I want them.

'I cook brown pasta and smother it in chilli tomato sauce (I’ve never used so much chilli and garlic in my life!) and roast a load of vegetables and throw them into a frittata,' she says.

'I love not being "the big girl" any more, but the most incredible thing is  how healthy I feel. I sleep brilliantly without waking up hungry, I’ve lost the hormonal mood swings and I feel so happy.

'This is by far the easiest diet I’ve ever done. It has changed my life. I just wish I’d known about it years ago.'

Picky: With the 2-Day Diet you don't have to make difficult choices and allow yourself the odd treat

As spring finally breaks, it’s time to consign those boots, coats and jumpers to the attic and start thinking about a summer wardrobe — and a summer body. And if you’re keen to shed a few pounds, there’s no better way than the Daily Mail’s 2-Day Summer Diet.

When we unveiled the 2-Day Diet earlier this year, thousands joined the revolution, losing weight and becoming healthier. Now, whether you’re already on the plan and want to give it a boost with fabulous new meal options, or you’re starting from scratch, the 2-Day Summer Diet is the perfect way to slim for summer parties and the beach. 

We began the new stage of the diet in Saturday’s Mail with a fabulous 32-page booklet packed with exciting recipes to tempt you. In today’s paper, we have even more dishes to keep you on the straight and narrow.  

The beauty is that you have to diet for only two consecutive days a week. Just 48 hours of low-carb, low-calorie meals in every seven days will help retrain your appetite for good. During the other five days you can enjoy delicious Mediterranean-style meals. 

The 2-Day Summer Diet is the brainchild of award-winning dietitian Dr Michelle Harvie, who specialises in food and exercise plans to prevent breast cancer, and renowned oncologist Professor Tony Howell, research director of the University of South Manchester’s Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention Centre. 

Their diet is unique because it has been clinically tested and proven to be more effective at shifting fat and easier to stick to than daily calorie-counting. It also leads to dramatic health improvements. 

Dr Harvie and Prof Howell’s studies showed a reduction in cancer risk for those who tried the 2-Day Diet. They also found it triggered a more dramatic drop in the hormone insulin than a conventional all-week-long diet.

Though insulin is vital for regulating sugar levels in the body, an excess is believed to be the root of many weight-related health problems — not just Type 2 diabetes, but also heart disease, some cancers (particularly breast cancer) and possibly dementia. 

The 2-Day Diet has also been specifically designed to stop you feeling hungry and so you do not have to count calories. You just avoid certain foods and stick within portion limits on others. 

Diet days are low in carbohydrates (bread, pasta, potatoes), which can make you feel hungry. A low-carb diet also boosts fat-burning: when carbohydrates are kept to a minimum, your body quickly shifts from storing fat to burning it. 

On non-diet days, Dr Harvie and Professor Howell suggest you opt for healthy Mediterranean-style meals, which should include plenty of fresh produce, including  fruit and vegetables, healthy fats and dairy products. 

Their blueprint should re-educate you to eat in the healthiest way possible, boosting the benefits of diet days and establishing eating habits that should keep you trim — for ever.
