It appears Lionel Messi isn't just a nightmare for defenders after he and team-mate Ezequiel Lavezzi pranked a staff member of the Argentina squad.

Filmed by Messi, Lavezzi proceeds to slap the coach to the amusement of the pair as they travel back on the team coach following their 2-1 opening Group F victory against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday.

Unamused: The staff member was not happy after being slapped following their 2-1 win vs Bosnia-Herzegovina

While the prank was to the obvious displeasure of the member of staff, as seen in the video uploaded to Messi's instagram account, he would have been happy with the Barcelona forward's performance at Rio de Janiero's iconic Maracana Stadium.

The 26-year-old captain led his country to victory against their European opponents with a sumptuous goal that has become his trademark for the Nou Camp outfit.

The goal was only Messi's second in three World Cups, but the strike proved decisive when Vedad Ibisevic pulled one back for Bosnia-Herzegovina, their first-ever in the tournament's history, to make it a nervy ending with five minutes remaining.

Coach Alejandro Sabella's side next face Iran in Belo Horizonte on Saturday before completing their group phase against Nigeria on June 25 in Porto Alegre.
