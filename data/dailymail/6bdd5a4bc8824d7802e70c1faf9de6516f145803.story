Simon Yates, the British Tour de France debutant who impressed in the Alps and Vosges Mountains, will not start stage 16 when the race resumes on Tuesday.

Yates featured in the breakaway on Saturday’s second stage in the Alps, and was only caught 5.5km from the summit of Risoul. But he admitted at the start of stage 15 on Sunday morning that his ‘big day out’ had taken its toll.

‘I’m pretty tired,’ said Yates. 'Sunday was a really big effort and I’m knackered at the minute.’

The 21-year-old from Bury has been closely monitored by his Australian team, Orica-GreenEdge, and they took the decision on Sunday evening that he should withdraw and return to his base in Girona.

Yates finished Sunday’s flat stage safely in the peloton, but with the Pyrenees still to come, his team put his long-term health over short-term ambitions.

‘It’s a massive jump to come to the Tour de France from where he’s been,’ said Yates’s sports director Matt Wilson. ‘There should be five or six steps in between. It’s a sink or swim thing but he’s definitely been swimming.

‘He’s had three attempts at a breakaway and made two of them,’ added Wilson. ‘To make a Tour de France breakaway is incredibly hard, everyone wants to be in them, and Saturday was a very, very strong breakaway.’

Yates and his twin brother, Adam, have been two revelations of the season, with Adam winning the Tour of Turkey in May. It was in Turkey that Simon crashed and broke his collarbone — a setback that, ironically, opened the door to a start at the Tour while Adam was rested.

Wilson said of both Yates brothers: ‘They know how to sniff out breakaways, they can climb and they know how to win races. They have an  awesome attitude.’

Meanwhile, there was heartbreak for Jack Bauer as the race left the mountains and arrived in Nimes.

The 29-year-old New Zealander attacked at the start of the stage and almost held on for the win 222km later.

Instead, he was swamped by the sprinters in the final 20 metres and crossed the line 10th. ‘In the last kilometre I thought I could win,’ said Bauer, who, with breakaway partner Martin Elmiger of Switzerland, held off the rampaging peloton even as the sprinters’ teams hunted them down.

The beneficiary was Alexander Kristoff, the Norwegian sprinter who now has two stage wins. Even he was sympathetic. ‘I hoped (Bauer) would hold on for second place,’ Kristoff said.
