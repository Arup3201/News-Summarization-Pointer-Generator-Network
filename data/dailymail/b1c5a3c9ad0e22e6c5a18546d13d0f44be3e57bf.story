 A man who appears to be Sidloyi is then flung from the car before it screeches to a halt and catches fire. 

According to iolnews two passengers sustained minor injuries in the crash, one escaped unharmed and another is still being treated at Groote Schuur Hospital.

Sidloyi's mother told local media that her son had visited her home in Khayelitsha before the accident, but she had gone out to the shops.

She was quoted as saying: 'I'm scared. Maybe if I was home when he came to visit I could have stopped him from going out. Maybe I could've prevented this from happening.'

Sidloyi had recently moved from his home in Gugulethu to Blaauwberg where he lived with his fiancé. 

Sidloyi's manager Jumbo Kosi from Jumbo Artist Management said the agency was shocked to hear of his death.

'Thabang was a young talented man. He was multi talented and did a lot of work under the agency.'
