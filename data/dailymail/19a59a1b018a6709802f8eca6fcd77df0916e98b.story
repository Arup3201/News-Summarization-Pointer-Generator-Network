Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta secured a memorable 2-0 win for Manchester City in Rome to send them into the last 16 of the Champions League.

French midfielder Nasri unleashed a blistering 20-yard drive early in the second half before Zabaleta added another with four minutes left to secure victory at the Stadio Olimpico and send City through as runners-up to Bayern Munich in Group E.

Despite missing Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure, Manuel Pellegrini’s side gave a steely display and the manager said he hopes it gives them the momentum to challenge Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, who are also in Monday’s draw along with Arsenal.

Pellegrini said: ‘We are happy because we achieved a target and now we will try to catch Chelsea in the Premier League.

We have important games in the Premier League and that is as important, maybe it is more important than this. We have to beat Leicester and then carry on winning in December.’

Given they were missing key players such as Aguero, Pellegrini believes the victory has scotched suggestions that City are a one-man team.

‘It’s not relief I feel,’ added the manager. ‘After we beat Bayern I knew we had a good chance. I’m very happy because we beat a good team and played well from the beginning to the end.

‘I trust in the players and the squad deserves more credit. We are more than just Kun (Aguero). This team is more than just one player. We have a lot of different critics. We are not trying to send messages to people. I think Roma are a good team and played well but against them in Manchester it was the worst we played and we still drew. Here I knew if we played as we have in the Premier League then we had a good chance to qualify. This team deserves a little more credit than it gets.’

City’s win owed as much to the heroics of goalkeeper Joe Hart as it did to goalscorers Nasri and Zabaleta. Most important was touching a header from Kostas Manolas on to a post.

Hart said: ‘Rome is a difficult place to come but Samir made our fans’ night for them. People wrote us off without our key players but we’re a strong unit, we believed in what we could do. 

'You don’t win two Premier League titles in three years easily. We have resolve, character and fantastic players — add that together and you’ve got a chance.’

For his part, Nasri looks on the verge of some of his best form for the club. The French forward said: ‘I think the performance of the team was amazing. It was important for me to score, after injury.

‘I took a while to get to my full level but now I am (fit).

‘With Yaya Toure and Kun Aguero missing, It was important to show we were a team and we did it. At 1-0, the save Joe Hart made was amazing.’
