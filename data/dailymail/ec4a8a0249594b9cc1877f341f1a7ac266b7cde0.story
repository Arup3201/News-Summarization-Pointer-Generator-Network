She's a best-selling international pop star and is currently showcasing her nifty footwork skills on Strictly Come Dancing.

Clearly not content with all things singing and dancing, Pixie Lott is venturing into beauty, too.

The 24-year-old has teamed up with a beauty brand to create a new daily facial cleansing and exfoliating brush that she promises will revolutionise your beauty regime and leave you with softer, clearer and brighter skin - just like her.

Beauty buff: Pixie Lott has been unveiled as the new brand ambassador of cleansing brush Magnitone and the flawless star has designed her own limited edition version for the brand

In her role as brand ambassador of Magnitone, the flawless star has designed her own limited edition Magnitone Lucid in Pink. 

Speaking about the latest addition to their roster, a spokesperson for the beauty brand said: 'We are delighted that Pixie Lott is the new ambassador for the brand. Magnitone is about having confidence in your skin, and she embodies the way we want women to feel about their appearance. 

'She has a natural radiance, energy and beauty that makes her an obvious choice to represent the brand voice. We're very much looking forward to working with her on the exciting campaign ahead.'

Pixie added: 'Daily demands and hectic schedules can take its toll on my complexion so it’s vital for me to maintain great, healthy, radiant looking skin. [These] facial brushes are the perfect solution as they help me get more from my daily cleansing and exfoliating routine and easily slot into my busy lifestyle.

'They are my ultimate beauty boosting must-have, and I'm thrilled to have been lucky enough to create my very own.'

Will it give you skin like Pixie's? The £69.99 brush promises to gently remove daily dirt and grime, rid the skin of pore impurities and gently buff away dry and dead skin cells for radiant, glowing skin

The £69.99 brush follows in the footsteps of the Clarisonic but claims that unlike other facial brushes on the market, it feature innovative Active Electromagnetic Technology, which apparently sends gentle electromagnetic vibrations into skin and is proven to purify and deep cleanse pores more effectively leaving you with a healthier, brighter complexion. 

Thanks to over 10,000 pulsations per minute, it promises to gently remove daily dirt and grime, rid the skin of pore impurities and gently buff away dry and dead skin cells for radiant, glowing skin.

If that wasn't enough, in between dancing on Strictly and partying with her co-stars, Pixie and her sister are opening the Pixie Lott Italia Conti in Chelmsford, Essex.

Dance star: Pixie is currently ranked joint second on the leader board alongside The Saturdays' Frankie Bridge, with Jake Wood and Caroline Flack tying in the top spot on Strictly 

The Mama Do hit-maker and stage school alumni is launching an Italia Conti associate school along with her sister Charlie-Ann and mother Beverley in order to give youngsters the same chances she had in life.

Pixie's new venture is aimed at children aged three and over and is due to open at Boswells School in January 2015.

Classes will run on Saturdays and give talented kids great links to the famous London theatre school that Pixie attended.

Her mother Beverley previously told the Chelmsford Weekly News: 'This is something we’ve wanted to do since Pixie was so successful at the school. We’re very excited about it.'
