This month, IMF director Christine Lagarde emerged from brief public hiatus with a new, softer look.

It appears that she is attempting using her wardrobe as a tool for reinvention as she continues to experience public unfavorability in France, following charges that she helped embezzle nearly €400 million of government funds in a fraud probe while serving as the country’s finance minister.

Likely in an effort to soften her image to help staunch her plummeting approval ratings, Lagarde has grown out her cropped silver hair into a feminine, shoulder-length bob and has begun wearing many shades of pink.

She wore a light pink Chanel suit to address the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in mid-September, and this month, a jewelled, vintage Chanel shift to a discussion at George Washington University. On the first day of the annual World Bank-IMF meetings Lagarde chose a new pink suit, and then re-wore the rosy Chanel suit on the following day. 

Her efforts at aesthetic reinvention may be seared with motive, but placing scandal aside, it presents an example of sartorial reform for women in both diplomatic circles as well as those belonging to Lagarde’s own peer group.

Lagarde, 57, has served as the director of the IMF since 2011. She took over the position from Dominique Strauss-Kahn who resigned after a New York hotel maid publicly charged him with sexual assault.

She was tasked with helping save the EU from falling off a fiscal cliff, and her clothes reflected the period with somber tones and restrictive shapes. Her hair, left in its natural silver-white tone, was consistently cut in a mannish crop that was both practical and assertive.

While never straying far from chic 
accoutrements like scarves, pearls, and Hermès bags, Lagarde still 
dressed with diplomatic conformities well known to the few women in her 
industry.

In
 2011, Lagarde was charged with participating in a fraud probe that paid
 nearly €400 million of tax funds to French businessman Bernard Tapie. 
She was acquitted of the allegations in May but is still considered an 
‘assisted witness’ in the case, meaning that she could be charged at a 
later date.

Following the acquittal, Lagarde lightened her public schedule only to reemerge in full force late last month with a longer, feminine haircut and new clothes.

While the IMF would not confirm to MailOnline if Lagarde has begun working with a wardrobe stylist, such an appointment would make sense. Seemingly overnight she has shed many of her scarves, which have been the subject of excessive social analysis, grown out her hair into a layered, shoulder-length bob, and set aside her valise of navy suits in favor of pearl-embellished, largely pink attire.

'She has begun to subvert not only her own industry’s standards, but those of her general age group as well'

In doing so, she has effectively begun to subvert not only her own industry’s standards, but those of her general age group as well.

Lagarde does not only appear 
hyper-feminine by diplomatic criterion. Her hair trumps a known cultural
 norm for women of their late fifties to cut their hair into a cropped 
style as their follicle condition begins to wane with age. Grey hair, 
too, is often masked beneath a monthly ritual of corrective hair 
coloring.

‘I
 think it’s a cultural thing that women feel after a certain point your 
hair shouldn’t be long,’ says hairstylist John Barrett, who has a salon 
in Bergdorf Goodman and styles Hillary Clinton’s hair.

‘It just wasn’t feminine, there was nothing feminine about it,’ Barrett says of Lagarde’s old style. He feels that the lack of femininity is often an issue with shorter cuts in general.

Simon Doonan, creative director at large for Barneys New York, thinks that particularly in Lagarde’s case the ‘shorter Nineties corporate hairdo gave her an air of competence but it was starting to look a bit passé.’

In layman’s terms, Lagarde’s more 
mannish haircut, paired with largely conservative attire, was in no way 
going to lend her an air of personability in the public eye.

But the cultural stipulation for shorter hair has much deeper implications than what simply meets the eye.

‘There is the sense of long hair on a
 woman being out of control and that being inappropriate,’ Hazel Clark,
 professor of fashion studies and chair of research at Parsons School of
 Design says. ‘Long hair has always symbolized femininity, and when it’s
 unkempt it is directly associated with sexuality.’

But
 on a more macro level, long hair still ‘is often perceived as not being
 appropriate as you age, since you are not looked at in a sexual context
 anymore,’ says Clark.

Lagarde’s decision to leave her hair 
in its au natural grey state is also unconventional. Typically, many 
women feel pressured to dye their hair in order to improve their 
perception in the workplace. But according to Doonan, ‘grey equals 
gravitas.’

Indeed, short hairstyles are 
practically de rigueur in Lagarde’s age group. In diplomatic circles, 
the short cut (favored by Lagarde’s contemporaries including Angela 
Merkel and Hillary Clinton) is a key part of the industry’s unwritten, 
but socially enforced grooming standards that masculinize female 
politicians’ appearance.

'Lagarde’s decision to 
also broaden her fashion appeal could work out to be her greatest diversionary 
tactic yet'

Women within the political arena tend to avoid subscribing to fashion at many 
costs, as a simple change in grooming or attire can lead to a distraction within the press (take Michelle Obama’s bangs as example). 

So it makes sense that hair aside, Lagarde’s decision to 
also broaden her fashion appeal could work out to be her greatest diversionary 
tactic yet. In the last year she has gone from being named 2012’s most 
loved French female political figure, to many of the country’s news 
outlets calling for her imprisonment. Fashion--often considered one of 
the more powerful means of personal articulation--is perhaps the 
quickest, most obvious way for Lagarde to try and change the public’s 
perception.

But her attempt at swaying popular opinion through her appearance must be orchestrated as a carefully balanced act.

‘If one is seen as being too 
interested in fashion and appearance you are considered not as serious 
as one might be otherwise,’ Clark says.

Clark adds that her sharp attention to fashion could represent a ‘pressure because she is representing the French nation and French women as a whole and is expected to demonstrate that stereotypical chicness.’

And at a time like this, it’s not unlikely that Lagarde would attempt to adapt to her countrymen’s pleasantly perceived archetype, rather than playing along with career social norms.

But still, ‘There is only a certain point she can go [with fashion],’ says Clark. ‘It’s something that will only change if there are more women in politics. I still think she has the pressure of conforming to a certain extent.’
