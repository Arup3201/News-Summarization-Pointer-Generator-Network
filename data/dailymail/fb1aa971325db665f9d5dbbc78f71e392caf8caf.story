A woman whose beloved prized dog was shaved by her jealous boyfriend has told how she thought the shih-tzu had been 'run over by a lawnmower'.

Zoe Ashman, 36, was in tears when she saw Crufts competitor Franklin's coat had gone after partner Rob Davey, 26, took clippers to the dog in a jealous rage.

Miss Adams told The Sun: 'I couldn't recognise him, he was a totally different dog.

'When I realised what had happened, my stomach turned. But Frankie was prancing around as if to say, "Look at me, I've had my hair cut".

'He looked like someone had run him over with a lawnmower. Frankie and I are inseparable.

'I picked him up and started to cry.'

Cruel Davey, who is self-employed, bragged on Facebook after his callous act.

He was caught by police and ordered to pay £2,000 compensation, as well as being and sentenced to a 12-month community order.

But despite his court punishment, the remorseless lout taunted Miss Ashman when he updated his Facebook status to read: 'Coming soon to stores near you after shave by rob davey "hair of the dog".'

He then added: 'Also coming soon rob's dog grooming service', as well as adding a post which appeared to reference his court appearance hitting the headlines and read 'Fame ay? So easy to come by'.

Miss Ashman incredibly says her and Davey are trying to rebuild their relationship after he apologised.

Neighbours revealed how police had been called to  Miss Ashman's house in Hertford, Hertfordshire, on a number of occasions during the couple's stormy seven-month relationship.

Friends told how she had eventually dumped Davey because of his wild, loutish behaviour - which they said was often linked to him drinking too much.
