A sow and her cub play beneath a beautiful Alaskan sky as they wait for the autumn freeze-up.

But life is not always easy for a single polar bear mother, rearing her cub all alone in the snowy wilderness.

These intimate pictures of a tender scene between mother and child were captured by wildlife photographer Steven Kazlowski along Bernard Sand Spit, in the eastern Alaskan Arctic.

Family ties: A polar bear sow yawning with her cub alongside her, as they await the autumn freeze-up on the Bernard Spit, along the eastern Arctic coast of Alaska

Play time: The cub and its mother were spotted playing in the snowy wilderness by wildlife photographer Steven Kazlowski, who took the pictures from a nearby boat

Fortunate: Mr Kazlowski said he 'felt pretty lucky to watch this interaction under the glowing magenta sunlight, as the sun was setting'

Hungry: But he also said he 'felt bad that the bears were not able to be out on the ice hunting seals' and 'they were so hungry they were trying eating tough strips of whale remains'

Side by side: The polar sow and her cub lie beside one another, staring out on to the water as the sun sets on the Bernard Spit, along the eastern Arctic coast of Alaska

'I felt pretty lucky to watch this interaction under the glowing magenta sunlight, as the sun was setting,' Mr Kazlowski said.

'But
 I also felt bad that the bears were not able to be out on the ice 
hunting seals and that they were so hungry they were trying eating tough
 strips of whale remains. The ice was not there for them.'

The mother bear can be seen chewing on what appears to be a piece of whale sinew, or a strip of stringy bowhead whale remains, that she scavenged for her and her cub.

Mr Kazlowski observed the bears over the course of eight weeks, taking his shots from a boat captained by his Inupiaq friend Melvin Jack Kayotuk.

'Only on one day did I get such amazing conditions of stunning sunset light and them feeding, resting, playing, frolicking and interacting,' he said.

'It was very special to witness this interaction with beautiful fresh snow and an amazing slow and steady sunlit afternoon.'

Sunset: Mr Kazlowski said there was only one day when he witnssed 'such amazing conditions of stunning sunset light and them feeding, resting, playing, frolicking and interacting'

'Interaction': Mr Kazlowski said: 'It was very special to witness this interaction with beautiful fresh snow and an amazing slow and steady sunlit afternoon'

Setting sun: The magenta sunlight is a phenomenon that lasts for long periods in the Arctic due to its latitudinal position. The bears can be seen resting together side by side

Mother and child: A polar bear cub nuzzles its mother and attempts to get her to play, on the Bernard Spit, along the eastern Arctic coast of Alaska

Sleep time: The bear takes a break from its play and falls asleep near to its mother on the Bernard Spit, along the eastern Arctic coast of Alaska, in September

The magenta sunlight is a phenomenon that lasts for long periods in the arctic due to its latitudinal position.

The pictures, taken in September last year, show the smaller bear, a coy - the term used to describe bears less than one year old - being doted on by his affectionate mother.

'I think single polar bear cubs get more attention and care from mom but they miss out on the fun of having a sibling to play with, Mr Kazlowski said.

'And polar bears are very social animals with one another by nature.'
