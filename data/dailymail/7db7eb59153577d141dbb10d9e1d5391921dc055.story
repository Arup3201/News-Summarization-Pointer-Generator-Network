Two British suspected drug dealers have been arrested in Portugal after being found with 1.5 tonnes of hashish in their fishing boat.

The pair, whose identities have not yet been released, were caught about 40 miles south of Faro after their boat's engine failed.

They had been adrift for 12 hours before they were rescued by the Maritime Police.

They were taken to hospital - one of them had a broken wrist and they were both displaying symptoms of hypothermia, reports the Correio da Manhãt.

The pair had been planning to take the boat to the Marina of Vilamoura and then travel on a lorry through northern Europe.

But their plan was thwarted when the engine failed and they were eventually forced to issue a Mayday call at 17:30 yesterday. 

The sheepish pair were rescued by a boat from the Maritime Police.

The men, who are thought to be aged around fifty, were arrested alongside a Brazilian man that was waiting for the boat's arrival.

The vessel 'Mary' was 
towed by a Navy ship and the hull was dismantled to ensure all the drugs had been removed from the vessel.

They had already been in the sights of the Judicial Police (PJ) for several months.

Their network was based in northern 
Europe and they acquired the drugs in Morocco.

The Correio da Manhã reports that more arrests may still be made in the coming days in Portugal or other countries across Europe. 

The men appeared in court today.
