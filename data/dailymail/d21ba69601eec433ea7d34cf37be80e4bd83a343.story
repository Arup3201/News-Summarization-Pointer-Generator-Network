Nigel Evans, the Deputy Commons Speaker was arrested at the weekend over rape and sexual assault allegations

Police launched their rape investigation into Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans as a result of the actions of a fellow Conservative MP, it can be revealed.

The MP accompanied one of the alleged victims to a police station while he made the allegations that triggered Mr Evans’s bombshell arrest last weekend.

Last night the MP, whose identity is being withheld by The Mail on Sunday, said: ‘It is important for legal reasons that I make absolutely no comment.’

The revelation that Mr Evans’s arrest was caused by one of his own party colleagues will add to the sense of shock that the incident has caused at Westminster.

It is also likely to intensify behind-the-scenes debate over whether the Ribble Valley MP should continue to carry out his Commons duties while detectives investigate.

Mr Evans says the allegations  that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another, over a period  dating from 2009 to last month, are ‘completely false’.

He has not been charged with any offences and has been bailed until June 19.

Last week, after what he described as the ‘worst two days of my life’, the Deputy Speaker returned to the Commons, where he was greeted warmly and publicly by colleagues on both sides of the House.

He has temporarily stepped aside from his official duties, but says that he intends to return to the chair of the chamber once the debates on the Queen’s Speech are over.

Nigel Evans gave a statement at his home in Pendleton Lancashire, where he said that allegations he raped one man and sexually assaulted another are 'completely false'

However, some MPs are privately advising 
Speaker John Bercow that Mr Evans should step down  completely while he
fights to clear his name.

Most Tory MPs support him staying in the
chair, while a majority of Labour MPs are opposed. The  Liberal 
Democrats are ‘hopelessly divided’ on the matter, a source said.

Lancashire Police has deployed ten officers on the investigation, 
called Operation Corsica, and has been in contact with the Serjeant at 
Arms – the official in charge of Commons security – about  the 
parliamentary procedure to  follow if officers decide to search Mr 
Evans’s office.

The force is treading carefully in the aftermath of the row five years ago when the then Serjeant, Jill Pay, granted consent for police to search the Westminster office of Conservative frontbencher Damian Green without a warrant as part of an investigation into Home  Office leaks.

No charges were ever brought, and Pay said that she ‘deeply regretted’ accepting a police request to keep the operation secret.

Mr Evans has confirmed that in 2009 he was interviewed by the then Tory Chief Hhip Patrick McLoughlin over allegedly making an unwanted advance to a man he was drinking with, but has said that it was a ‘misreading of  signals’.

Much of the attention following Mr Evans’s arrest has focused on a striking red mark running down his forehead. He has said it was the result of a massage for a tension headache.

The Soho parlour Mr Evans visited confirmed that it offered tension headache treatment, but insisted that its masseur could not have inflicted the mark.

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: ‘We are speaking to a number of people in connection with this investigation, but as this is an ongoing criminal inquiry we will not be  providing any further detail.

‘We would encourage anyone who has experienced sexual abuse or who has information about it to have the confidence to report it to us.’

Mr Evans refuses to talk about  any details of the allegations  while the police investigation is  in progress.

But in a statement after his arrest, he said: ‘The allegations are completely false and I can’t understand why they have been made, especially as I have continued to socialise with one [of his accusers] as recently as last week.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
