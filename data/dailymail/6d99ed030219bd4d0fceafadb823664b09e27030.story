President Obama has arrived in Japan at the start of his latest Asia trip and was greeted by a familiar face: American Ambassador Caroline Kennedy.

Mrs Kennedy stood alongside her husband Edwin Schlossberg, who still lives in New York in spite of his wife's diplomatic posting in Tokyo but he flew over for the presidential visit.

Rather than going straight for a formal welcome reception at a government building, the group headed to an iconic landmark of another sort.

Obama and his dining partner, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, didn't to have trouble scoring seats at Sukiyabashi Jiro.

The 10-seat restaurant is run by 89-year-old Jiro Ono, who was featured in the 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

Obama and Abe greeted each other outside the underground restaurant before heading in for the private dinner that typically costs about $300.

'That's some good sushi right there,' President Obama said on his way out.

They were accompanied by Kennedy, Schlossberg and White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice.

The restaurant earned one of the rare three Michelin star ratings in the world and owner Jiro Ono is widely considered to be the best sushi chef worldwide.

The stop in Japan is meant to help strengthen ties between Obama and Abe.

An unidentified senior Japanese government official said that they 'have good discussions all the time, whenever they see each other.'

'But the more frequently they see each other, the better.'

President Obama confirmed Wednesday that America's mutual security treaty with Japan applies to the islands at the center of a territorial dispute between China and Japan.

'The policy of the United States is clear,' he said in a written response to questions published in Japan's Yomiuri newspaper before his arrival in Tokyo at the start of a four-country Asia tour.

'The Senkaku islands are administered by Japan' and therefore fall under the U.S.-Japan treaty, he wrote.

'And we oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands.'

His statement seems aimed at reassuring Japan that the U.S. would come to its defense if China were to seize the islands, known as Diayou in China.

Russia's annexation of Crimea has sparked concern about America's political will to protect Asian allies, notably in Japan and the Philippines.

A Chinese government spokesman 
responded that China has 'indisputable sovereignty' over the islands, 
and said 'the so-called Japan-U.S. alliance' should not harm China's 
territorial rights.

'We 
firmly oppose applying the Japan-U.S. security treaty in the issue of 
the Diaoyu islands,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said at a 
regular briefing.

'The U.S.
 should respect facts, take a responsible attitude, remain committed to 
not taking sides on territory and sovereignty issues, speak and act 
cautiously, and earnestly play a constructive role in regional peace and
 stability.'

Obama told the 
Yomiuri the United States is deepening its ties with China, but 'our 
engagement with China does not and will not come at the expense of Japan
 or any other ally.'

He said
 the U.S. will continue to take steps to reduce the impact of its 
military presence in Okinawa, but added, 'it's important to remember 
that the U.S. Marine Corps presence on Okinawa is absolutely critical to
 our mutual security. It plays a key role in the defense of Japan.'

Pre-emptive protests: Demonstrators gathered outside of the American embassy in Manila ahead of President Obama's one-night visit next week to protest the increased U.S. military presence in the country

Riot police: Police armed with truncheons, shields and a fire hose clashed Wednesday with more than 100 left-wing activists  

The President can expect to get a slightly colder reception as his Asia trip continues, as protests have already broken out in Manila ahead of his Monday arrival.

Police armed with truncheons, shields 
and a fire hose clashed Wednesday with more than 100 left-wing activists
 who rallied at the U.S. Embassy in Manila to oppose a visit by 
President Barack Obama and an expected security pact that would increase
 the American military presence in the Philippines.

Riot
 policemen blocked the flag-waving activists near the heavily fortified 
embassy compound but the protesters slipped past them, sparking a brief 
scuffle in view of motorists stuck in traffic.

Some of the protesters carried paper U.S. flags with the message: 'Obama, not welcome.'

The
 police sprayed the protesters with water from a fire truck to push them
 away. A police officer was punched in the face in the melee but no 
arrests were made.

The proposed accord would allow more U.S. troops, aircraft and ships to be temporarily stationed in selected Philippine military camps as a counterweight to China and as a standby disaster-response force

Wavering support: The United States and the Philippines, which are treaty allies, have been scrambling to overcome differences to finalize a new security accord in time for Obama's visit

The United States and the Philippines, which are treaty allies, have been scrambling to overcome differences to finalize a new security accord in time for Obama's visit.

The accord would allow more U.S. troops, aircraft and ships to be temporarily stationed in selected Philippine military camps as a counterweight to China and as a standby disaster-response force.

About 500 American soldiers have been based in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide anti-terrorism training and intelligence to Filipino troops battling al Qaeda-linked militants.

Obama's overnight stay in Manila comes after his visits to Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia.
