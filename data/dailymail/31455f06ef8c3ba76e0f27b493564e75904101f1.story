It was billed as one of the 'biggest snowstorms in history' for residents of the East Coast.

But one group of residents from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, decided to make the most of the snow from the 'Blizzard of 2015' by having a massive snowball fight downtown.

Dozens of residents got in touch with their inner child and gathered up the snow to create huge snowballs which they hurled at each other.

Ready...set...go: Locals dressed up in winter coats and woolly hats lined both sides of the square

Snow fight: Dozens of adults and a couple of kids let each have a fistful of snow as they had a massive fight

The wintry fun was publicized on Facebook and broke out at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, in Market Square where over two feet of snow had fallen.

Locals, dressed up in winter coats and woolly hats and lined both sides of the square where they played in the snow  for about 45 minutes.

Organizers said that the event was  in honor of the town's settlers, hearkening back to a fictitious event called the 'inaugural Portsmouth Snowball Fight' of 1624.'

Dozens of adults and a couple of kids let each have a fistful of snow as they threw gigantic snowballs aimed at hitting each other right in the face.

One person was even seen waving a pirate flag, complete with a skull and crossbones, during the snow melee. 

According to locals, the fun didn't stop after the snowball fight because everyone continued on to nearby bars which were packed with people who fancied a tipple to warm them up.

Good fun: After the dire warnings and worrying predictions sent out by weathermen, the snowball fight offered a chance to let off some steam, say local residents

Blizzard: The storm reached blizzard status in Portsmouth, where residents saw  sustained winds of 25 mph or greater

Local resident Calum Ryan told WMUR that he had a great time and was really glad that he had braved the freezing cold temperatures to come out for the snowball fight. 

He said cheerfully: 'Oh, it was worth it!' 

Winter storm Juno reached blizzard status in Portsmouth, where residents saw four consecutive hours of visibility below a quarter-mile and sustained winds/frequent gusts of 25 mph or greater.  

Maine and New Hampshire each declared a state of emergency and government offices in both states were closed on Tuesday. 

And after the dire warnings and worrying predictions sent out by weathermen and officials, the snowball fight offered a chance to let off some steam, say residents. 

Ben Goodwin told WMUR: 'A lot of people were scared, you know: '[They told us] stay inside, it's going to be really chilly...but you get outside and get some exercise, and it's just nice.'
