Plano police officers responded to an apartment in the 1500 block of J Place at around 1.40pm on January 9 to discover 2-year-old Grace Ford unconscious in her crib with duct tape covering her face.

According to a page created by the toddler's family on the fundraising site YouCaring.com, Grace had been deprived of oxygen.

On January 22, Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the child's death a homicide caused by suffocation.  

Grace was reportedly staying in the Plano home of her father, Mitchum Ford, who lived with his fiancee, Melinda Muniz.

Mr Ford reportedly had been locked in a custody battle with his ex-wife, Emily Ward, over Grace’s care, Dallas Morning News reported.

According to Muniz’s arrest affidavit cited by the station WFAA, it was Ford who called police January 9 asking to perform a welfare check at his apartment.

Officers who arrived at the home on J Place found Grace Ford duct taped in her crib and Muniz lying on the floor of another room with her also mouth taped shut and her pants pulled down.

The affidavit states that the 25-year-old woman told police she had been sexually assaulted by an unknown man, but medical tests showed no signs of rape.

According to a post shared by Emily Ward on her Facebook page Tuesday evening, Muniz had confessed to cheating on Ford and faking amnesia, beating herself up and lying about her rape to cover up the toddler's murder. 

Ward also wrote that the woman was caught on a surveillance camera buying duct tape and scissors at a nearby store shortly before police were called to Ford’s home.

The mother’s claims were corroborated in part by the arrest affidavit, which stated that Muniz and Ford were in the process of breaking up.

'What a monster!!!' Ward wrote on Facebook. ‘I hope she gets everything she has coming to her from the law. God will make sure justice is served to the fullest!!!’

Grace's family decided to donate the child's organs ahead of her funeral held January 18.
