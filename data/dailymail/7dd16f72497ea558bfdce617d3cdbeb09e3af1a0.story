'Flirting': Saheena Tegally, 26,  is accused of swapping numbers and sending an uninsured Porsche 911 driver flirty texts after pulling him over on the road

A police officer accused of flirting with an uninsured Porsche told a court today that a text he sent telling her she should dress only in underwear while at work was 'flattering' and 'just banter'.

Saheena Tegally, 26, is accused of telling her colleagues to let Richard Myerson off the hook after the pair swapped numbers and he asked her out on a date.

It is alleged she flirted with Myerson
 after he was stopped behind the wheel of his Porsche after reports of 
an altercation with a cyclist in Highgate, north London last July.

The court was told the pair had swapped numbers and over the next few days texted back and forth.

In the days after Myerson was pulled over in his 911 turbo by Tegally and two colleagues, he sent her a text which read: 'It’s far too hot to be in uniform. You could sit by that desk in your underwear.

'Then people would take bad news much easier.'

Tegally then texted back saying that she 
was on duty and wasn’t behind a desk, Wood Green Crown Court heard. Later Myerson had sent Tegally a 
picture of himself posing in a 1940s outfit.

Giving evidence today, Tegally, who worked at West Hampstead Police station said it was 'nice' to receive the attention from Myerson but it did not mean she wanted to meet up for 'a drink or even chicken.'

She is accused of concealing the fact that Myerson was uninsured, not revealing an entire email chain showing that the insurance had expired, and encouraging a fellow officer to rip up his notebook containing evidence.

Tegally of London Colney, near St Albans, Hertfordshire, denies one charge of perverting the course of justice and has been suspended from duty pending the outcome of the trial.

Asked by prosecutor David Markham whether she thought it was appropriate for a professional investigator to exchange messages of this type she said: 'It wasn’t professional. None of it was professional.

'I had completely switched off… his messages were just banter.'

The court heard that they exchanged a chain of jokey texts and emails over the next few days, and over text when asked if he would beat her in a race, Mr Myerson had said: 'I don’t know I’m very competitive.'

Tegally responded: 'I would still win,” to which Mr Myerson replied: 'Lol we’ll see I have met my match at last. At least we’ve got a great story for how we met.'

She told the court how she had received Myerson’s insurance forms and told officers that she believed Mr Myerson to have been insured.

However she admitted that she had not checked the date of expiry for the policy and hadn’t realised that it expired in May.

Giving evidence, wearing a dark blazer and suit trousers and an orange top with her hair tied back, she said: 'I believed it was covered by misreading the date.'

'I only actually read that email properly the day after I was arrested.'

Getting emotional in the dock, she said: 'I worked hard to become a police officer and as much as I am struggling that job is my life. I wouldn’t have done that and I have no reason to cover up absolutely anything.'

Banter: Tegally told Wood Green Crown Court that Mr Myerson's text messages were 'just banter'

She added, speaking about the attention from Mr Myerson: 'It was flattering, it was nice, but that doesn’t for a minute mean I was going to meet with him for a drink or even chicken.

'I didn’t plan on meeting Mr Myerson.

'The fact that he’s got a Porsche, it’s a sports car. Cars don’t actually mean that much to me.'

The court was also told that Tegally had boasted to her friend that Mr Myerson had offered to take her on a date, and that she and the businessman had joked about meeting up to arrest pickpockets.

The jury heard Mr Myerson texted her saying: 'What day are you working so we can go look for pickpockets?'

She had replied: 'I’m not working tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday. Lol. X'

Later she said: 'I wish sometimes I got two days off.'

Tegally also texted her best friend on July 12 bragging about having seized a Porsche.

She said: ' seized a Porsche off a 25 year old. He is minted and asked to take me out. He has got his Porsche back as it was seized by mistake.'

She denies one count of perverting the course of justice on July 11 2013.

The trial continues.
