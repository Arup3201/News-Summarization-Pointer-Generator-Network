Romelu Lukaku has vowed to breathe new life into Everton’s season and lift the pressure on manager Roberto Martinez after ending a six-game barren run.

The club’s £28million record signing struck an injury-time equaliser against West Ham on Tuesday night to keep Martinez’s side in the FA Cup and head off a growing crisis following four straight Premier League defeats.

It was Lukaku’s eighth goal in 27 appearances since joining from Chelsea in the summer, but only his first in seven after being dropped to the bench for two games.

Now the Belgium star is determined to fire Everton up the table and still hopes they can lift the FA Cup or Europa League this season.

‘After two games on the bench, I knew it was time to react,’ said Lukaku. 

‘I wanted to show the manager how he can count on me. I wanted to show it was just a temporary thing, and now I am ready to move on and push myself to the limit.

‘I want to win silverware, I want to end up as high as we can in the league and we have five months to do that. I just want to play my best football now.

‘It’s been difficult but it’s something you all have to go through as a footballer. I just had to stay calm and focused, knowing my time would come.

‘I’ve been through a period like this before in my first year at Anderlecht. 

'I was a 16-year-old and I went 10 games without scoring a goal, although I still won the league that season. 

'So I knew that I needed to stay focused and not worry about anything off the pitch because I would come through it again.’

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez have been heavily criticised at times this season

Martinez’s side have been criticised for failing to break teams down this season and being too intricate at times.

Lukaku revealed that the players have asked their manager to exploit his power by being more direct.

He added: ‘We mixed up how we play a bit more against West Ham. 

'At times we were a bit more direct and that makes it easier for me because when I am one versus one, running on a defender, that gives me a better chance.

‘The players were asking about doing that too. I asked them and we all said to the manager, “can we play a bit more direct sometimes?”.

‘We have a style of play where we keep the ball a lot, but knew we needed to take more responsibility, play to my strengths more and they did it perfectly. I tried to deliver for them and I did it.’
