A few words in Spanish, a quick kiss of the badge and Gareth Bale had sidestepped the first challenge of his new life as the world’s most expensive footballer.

What a day it was for Bale. It did feel slightly surreal, he confessed, to find himself juggling a football in the sunshine before an estimated 30,000 Real Madrid fans.

Like a prisoner released from nearly 100 days of transfer talks he emerged blinking and testing his limbs to see if they still did what they did before.

Scroll down for videos of Bale's grand unveiling at the Bernabeu.

Kissing the badge: Bale wasted no time in showing his affection for his new club at the Bernabeu

The
 Madridistas had flocked to the Bernabeu Stadium to witness the official
 unveiling of their newest Galactico, the man who had cost £86million, 
more than Cristiano Ronaldo.

What
 on earth would such a footballer look like? Well, he looked clean-cut 
in his skinny black suit and pencil-thin black tie, brimming with 
emotion as he was introduced by Real president Florentino Perez.

After
 one of at least four costume changes, he appeared truly proud to step 
on to the pitch in the pristine white kit of his new team and his bright
 yellow adidas boots.

The 
keepy-uppies, to be honest, left a little to be desired — ‘I was very 
nervous,’ he said — but the football comes later. Real fans will soon 
appreciate what Bale the footballer does well and it isn’t keepy-uppies.

Yesterday, the skill of the boy from Cardiff was to sprinkle some of his humble charm upon his new followers.

He
 didn’t venture far into his new language but far enough to make an 
impression. In Spanish, Bale said: ‘Hello, this is a dream. Thank you 
for this great welcome. Hala Madrid.’

His
 ‘Hail Madrid’ finish was particularly well received, his beaming smile 
was effortless and he seemed happier when asked to drop kick footballs 
into the steep tiers of the stands or lash the ball into an empty goal 
to oblige photographers. When he pulled up the front of his shirt and 
gave the Real crest a smacker, it drew the biggest cheer of the day.

‘Gar-eth
 Bailey, Gar-eth Bailey, Gar-eth Bailey,’ the fans chanted. They briefly
 sang the names of Mesut Ozil — the  playmaker on his way to Arsenal 
after the arrival of Bale — and Iker Casillas — the out-of-favour 
goalkeeping legend. But generally the event was on message.

FIRST EL CLASICO

v Barcelona (A) - October 27

At
 times, it felt like a celebrity wedding as the dignitaries breezed in 
to take their seats with nods and smiles. They faced the stage erected 
last week in the hope Daniel Levy may be convinced to speed Tottenham’s 
side of things up slightly.

Television
 screens showed re-runs of Bale’s devastating displays for Spurs against
 Inter Milan, the Champions League ties which launched the Welshman into
 a different orbit in 2010.

The
 Real Madrid board arrived, suited and serious behind shades. Among 
their number were former players Emilio Butragueno and Fernando Redondo.

Then
 came Bale’s family, including his parents and his childhood sweetheart,
 Emma Rhys-Jones, with their 11-month-old daughter Alba Violet.

His agents, team Stellar, managed admirably to contain their delight at pushing this one over the line.

Bale
 appeared fashionably late to a round of applause and a sigh of relief 
that Levy had not reappeared brandishing the small print and demanding a
 few euros more.

Negotiations
 were ‘intense’ and ‘complex’, said Perez with diplomacy, and Bale, when
 asked, neatly swerved the question about the Tottenham question. All in
 the past, he insisted. In the present, Bale pulled on a set of cheap 
headphones to listen to the translation as Perez took the stage before 
two giant photographs.

One 
showed Bale in action for Wales, the other of him as a boy, aged about 
12, wearing a Real Madrid shirt from the Steve McManaman era and making a
 peace symbol with two fingers.

Here
 was the centre point of the script. Bale supported Real Madrid as a 
boy. Not quite Real duvets and curtains in South Wales but he slept in 
this shirt and dreamed of playing for them.

The only way is up: Bale is joining the stars at the Bernabeu

Gareth Bale to get more goals than Cristiano Ronaldo in La Liga this season - 10/1

Total La Liga Goals - Over 16.5: 5/6; Under 16.5: 5/6

He
 referred repeatedly to them as the biggest club in the world, noted 
their nine European titles and called Cristiano Ronaldo the best player 
in the world, airbrushing Lionel Messi from the picture for effect.

This
 was not lost on his audience. When Neymar arrived at Barcelona earlier 
this summer, he had done precisely the same in reverse; hailing Messi 
and ignoring Ronaldo.

That’s all part of the politics where these two rivals are concerned.

Everyone
 took care to tiptoe around the world-record transfer fee. It is 
advertised as £78m by Real rather than £86m to satisfy Ronaldo’s ego.

Again,
 it’s all part of the politics and, if Bale was still in any doubt that
 he was embarking on an adventure into a different dimension, then 
Perez gave it to him straight.

‘You
 are now in the most demanding club in the world but we will always be 
by your side,’ said Perez. ‘Challenges are constant, even after victory,
 but never forget the energy of this stadium will be your ally. Many 
great players have played here and you will be one of their heirs.

‘Gareth
 Bale, this is your stadium, this is your shirt, this is your pitch and
 these are your fans. From now on this is your home.

‘Welcome to your team. Welcome to Real Madrid.’

Bale
 gulped. Who can blame him? It is a long way from the Cardiff Civil 
Service Under Nines — or Southampton’s Academy for that matter.

It
 is a big step from Tottenham, too, for a 24-year-old. Luka Modric 
needed time to adjust and he did not carry the label of the world’s most
 expensive footballer.

Selling point: There are plenty of Bale shirts on sale in the Madrid club shop

From 
the moment of his debut, expected to be away at Villarreal a week on 
Sunday, Bale will stand direct comparison to Ronaldo and the Barcelona 
pair of Messi and Neymar.

The
 next time he steps out in public on to the Bernabeu turf, against 
Getafe a week later, he will be judged by these people as a footballer.

Not
 only that, he will be judged as the world’s most expensive 
footballer; someone who banks £12m a year. Nerves will not be an amusing
 excuse.

He will not be 
Gareth Bale the polite, well-mannered and self-effacing homeboy from 
Cardiff, prepared to risk a few words of Spanish in a public arena. He 
will be Gareth Bale the Galactico, expected to win the Champions League.

Wish him well.
