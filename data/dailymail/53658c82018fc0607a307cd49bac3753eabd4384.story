Armed police have arrested a man wanted in connection with a violent  rape of a woman.

Dorset Police said Dean Goodwin, 32, was held in Poole at 5.45pm and had been taken to Bournemouth police station.

Officers wanted to speak to Goodwin after a woman, aged in her 20s, was 
subjected to a serious sexual assault at an address in Poole on Friday.

Arrest: Dorset Police said Dean Goodwin, 32, pictured, was held in Poole at 5.45pm

Detective Superintendent Mark Cooper said: 'I'd like to thank the public
and the media for their help and support throughout this intensive 
police operation.

'Our officers and staff have worked tirelessly and I'm pleased we have 
been able to bring this to a safe conclusion with the arrest tonight of 
Dean Goodwin.'

Police had been unable to find Goodwin who they wanted to question in connection with the rape of a woman aged in her 20s in her own home in Poole, Dorset.

Police who described the assault as 'shocking', had warned the public not to approach Goodwin.

It emerged this afternoon that police missed the chance to apprehend Goodwin on Sunday night when he returned to a social club he had broken into in Wallisdown, Poole.

Goodwin allegedly smashed his way into the closed Liberal Club at 6pm, helping himself to half a pint of lager and some biscuits, and then left.

The victim was raped in her flat in the Parkstone area of Poole, Dorset

Police said the attack on the young woman on Friday was 'exceptionally nasty'.

‘It was an exceptionally nasty attack and one that gives us  great cause for concern,’ said Detective Inspector Marcus Hester of Dorset police.

Up to 40 officers conducted door-to-door enquiries in the hunt for Goodwin. High-visibility police patrols were in place in and around the Poole and Bournemouth area and the force helicopter had been called into action.

The rape victim had the front door of her home in Poole kicked down in the middle of the night last Friday. Neighbours said that two weeks earlier armed police had visited the property following another disturbance.

Police said the rape victim was being looked after by her family supported by specially trained officers.
