A squirrel poses proudly with a perfectly-formed snowball while another makes sure to capture the moment... by taking a photo.

The pair of red squirrels were happy to play model and photographer - before the one behind the camera got fed up and wanted a turn at posing.

The playful exchange is picture perfect, with the snow falling lightly as the squirrels play around with their new toys.

The two red squirrels frolic about in the snow, and one decides to film their friend with a giant snowball

Photographer Vadim Trunov, 30, captured the courting pair in the woods in Voronezh, Russia, where he lives.

He said: 'I took the photographs in the woods near the town, the squirrels were not skittish and are not afraid of people as they live so close to humans.

'I fed them nuts, which they happily took from me and hid in the snow, they kept taking nuts from me and then hiding them.

'Squirrels love to hide nuts, then find them again when they are hungry so they can eat.

'I decided to make a snowball with a nut inside and then left it on the ground.

But the 'photographer' gets bored of capturing the action, and decides to get involved in the scene; and right, the squirrel's became interested as a nut was place in the middle of the snowball

'A squirrel ran up, grabbed the snowball and picked it up. Perhaps she sensed the nut inside.

'Then it happened again with the second snowball I made so I decided to try and do a series of shots about a squirrel photographing another squirrel holding the snowball.'

Mr Trunov, who was only four metres away from the pair, set up a camera on a tripod and made another snowball with nuts inside for the squirrels so he could snap the adorable snowy scene.

The adorable scene was shot by photographer Vadim Trunov, 30, in the woods in Voronezh, Russia

He said: 'A squirrel ran up to the camera almost straight away and began to sniff it.

'A second squirrel grabbed a snowball and picked it up, again, probably to feel if there was a nut in it.

'She dropped it and picked it up again and it looked like she was posing for the camera.

The squirrel to the left stands upright and gives its best side for the camera, dictated to by its partner in crime

'Then the first squirrel climbed onto the camera, reached for its friend and grabbed her snowball.

'It was a nice moment and to capture it with the two squirrels simultaneously I made more than ten snowballs.

'Squirrels are very playful and curious animals, and I was happy to photograph this moment.'

The pair played with snowballs and posed for the camera - clever enough to realise inside was a nut

Lovely moment where one gets behind camera to snap their friend, but then gets bored and joins in
