She wed her toyboy husband six months ago.

And today it was obvious Spain's Duchess of Alba and her younger, dashing husband were still very much enjoying married life as they stepped out for a lunch date in Paris.

The eccentric billionairess, 85, held hands with her 61-year-old toyboy as they strolled the streets of the French capital.

Dressed head to toe in several different shades of blue - which included a hairpiece, shoes, dress and stockings - the quirky duchess clung to her husband's arm as they browsed a book shop.

The couple married in a flamboyant 
ceremony last October; the bride, an eccentric billionaire with more 
titles than Queen Elizabeth II while her groom was a mere civil servant young
enough to be her son.

But despite the objections of her six
children - and plenty of public controversy - Spain’s colourful Duchess
of Alba wed Alfonso Diez at her 15th century palace in Seville.

The famously flamboyant Cayetana 
Fitz-James Stuart wore a delicate pale pink gown designed by Victorio y 
Lucchino for her third marriage, which took place in front of 38 guests.

Well-wishers donned fancy dress and wigs in an attempt to copy her quirky style as they celebrated in the city’s streets.

The twice-widowed Duchess’s children 
feared Diez was a gold-digger - so he has relinquished his rights to her
£3billion fortune in an effort to appease them.

The duchess, who is a distant relative
of Winston Churchill and Princess Diana, went ahead with the marriage 
despite her children’s qualms.

It emerged in August that she has divided her fortune between her six children to convince them that her suitor is besotted with her rather than her money.

Known now for her frizzy white hair, squeaky voice and wildly colourful clothes, the duchess is among Spain’s most famous people

Last year, she was at the centre of a sex scandal when Spanish magazine Interviu published a 30-year-old picture on its front cover of the duchess sunbathing topless in Ibiza.

She and Diez, a social security administration employee, are old acquaintances through her second husband, who was a former priest, and Diez’s brother.

They bumped into each other about three years ago outside a cinema in Madrid and eventually started dating.
