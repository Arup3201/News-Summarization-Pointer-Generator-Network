A top cop in Chicago has been stripped of his badge and gun under accusations that he jammed his gun in a suspect's mouth during an interrogation.

Commander Glenn Evans, who until Wednesday headed the Harrison District in the city's West Side, is charged with official misconduct and aggravated battery, both felonies. He's expected in court on Thursday.

The complaint says Evans threatened to kill Rickey Williams, 24, after a chase in Chicago's infamous South Side back in January 2013, WBEZ reported.

Evans, then a commander in the Grand Crossing district, chased the man with his officers after they spotted him with a gun.

The cops eventually restrained Williams in a vacant home but never found the gun, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

An analysis later showed DNA from the suspect matched samples from the commander's weapon.

Evans is praised by his bosses as a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense cop who often joins his officers in patrols. He was promoted to commander in 2012.

Among his officers, he's popular for his aggressive policing, according to the Sun-Times.

But Evans has had dozens of citizens complaints filed against him, although only two resulted in formal discipline, the paper reported.

Yet Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who heads the Chicago PD and promoted Evans to commander, remains on his side.

Even as late as Monday, McCarthy gave reporters a staunch defense of McCarthy.

'Do I support him? If I didn’t support him, he wouldn’t be there,' McCarthy said when asked about a recommendation by the Independent Police Review Authority that Evans be let go, the Chicago Tribune reported.

'I'm not going to answer that question,' he told the reporter who asked him. 'That’s absurd.'

In a statement after the charges were filed, McCarthy said, 'The alleged actions, if true, are unacceptable to the both the residents we serve and to the men and women of this department.'
