Two Europeans accused of murdering a young boy in the most popular tourist resort in Madagascar have been burnt to death by a mob of vigilantes, it emerged today. 

A third European man who was quizzed over the alleged killing of the eight-year-old boy was lynched hours later and his body set ablaze in a separate attack.

The horrific killings took place on Nosy Be, an idyllic Indian Ocean island located off the northwest coast of Madagascar, which attracts holidaymakers from all over the world including Britain.

Fire: Locals on the Madagascan island of Nosy Be are allegedly pictured watching one of two European men accused of murdering an eight-year-old boy being burnt to death on Wednesday night

Locals went on the rampage on 
Wednesday following reports that a Frenchman called Sebastian and an 
Italian called Roberto had kidnapped an eight-year-old child.

There
 were claims that the men, whose surnames have not been revealed, had 
not only killed the boy, but cut off his tongue and genitals.

Police commander Guy Bobin Randriamaro said: ‘The rioters launched a manhunt and killed the Europeans.

‘Both men were not only suspected of murdering the boys, but were also said to be trafficking human organs.’

The rampaging mob originally stormed a police station in Hell-Ville, capital of Nosy Be, where it thought the pair of murder suspects were being held.

Police fired shots in the air, but it was not enough to disperse the increasingly angry crowd. 

Mr Randriamaro said the men were finally chased and cornered on the palm-fringed Ambatoloaka beach on Nosy Be, where they were attacked. 

They were kept alive long enough to be tortured, and are said to have ‘confessed’ to killing the boy, and to trafficking organs, before both were set on fire. Both died from their burns.

Up to 4000 Madagascans witnessed the lynching of the two men, said a Frenchman living on Nosy Be.

He claimed that both were made ‘scapegoats’ for a murder they had nothing to do with. 

The
 mob went on to torch around eight houses, and to start attacking 
police, who are thought to have wounded at least two members of the 
crowd.

A third man was later lynched and his body set ablaze, police in Madagascar reported later.

Witnesses saw him being dragged from a car and thrown on to the flames at Ambatoloaka beach.

He
 is said to have been questioned by detectives on Wednesday along with 
the other two men. His name and nationality were not known, but he was 
known to be a European.

The boy’s horribly mutilated body was found this morning, said the spokesman.

France’s consulate in Madagascar has 
immediately warned all of its nationals to stay away from Nosy Be island
 – the biggest resort in Madagascar - ‘until order is restored.'

A spokesman added: ‘We are working 
with the authorities on the island to try and work out the exact 
circumstances of these killings.

‘Nosy Be is a very popular tourist destination but we are asking people to be especially careful.’

Despite
 its upmarket tourist resorts, Madagascar is an extremely poor place, 
with some 90 per cent of its population of 22 million people living on 
less than two dollars a day.

Demonstrators involved in the killings claim they found human organs in a fridge in the building where the men were staying.

Many Madagascar residents believe human organs are ‘stolen’ for use by cults, or in witchcraft ceremonies.

It is common for them to blame outsiders for this practice, and incidents of mob justice are commonplace.

However, the triple killing will have a devastating effect on the tourist industry in the economically troubled country.
