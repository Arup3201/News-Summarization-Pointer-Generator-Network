Ministers threw a cloak of secrecy yesterday over how many Romanians and Bulgarians they expect to flood into the country.

To fury at Westminster, the Immigration Minister snubbed four MPs who asked him to reveal the figures – saying he did not want to scare people.

Mark Harper said it would not be ‘helpful’ to let the public know what to expect when border controls are lifted in less than 11 months. It is feared the wall of secrecy will leave town halls, schools and hospitals unable to prepare properly.

Long wait: The visa queue at the British Embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria as the Immigration Minister snubbed questions on how many Romanians and Bulgarians were expected to flood the country, saying he did not want to scare people

Tory MPs said it was ‘madness’ to 
throw open the UK’s borders without giving voters an idea of what to 
expect. The Government has carried out a study on how many of the 
29million citizens of Romanian and Bulgaria might move to the UK when 
they get full EU rights in January.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles – 
who has seen the figures, and has warned of a potential shortage of 
housing – previously indicated they would be made available for public 
debate.

But, amid heated exchanges in the 
Commons yesterday, Mr Harper refused to share what the Government knows.
 He was asked repeatedly either to release the data or to explain what 
the Government was doing to deter a new wave of migration from Eastern 
Europe.

Migrants from Romania and Bulgaria will receive only the minimum level of benefits when they arrive in the UK, the Government has said

Mr Harper replied that he was 
chairing a Whitehall committee to look at how to stop migrants abusing 
the benefits system. Ideas include trying to make it harder for 
newcomers to access benefits or ask them to carry residence cards.

He told MPs: ‘Speculative projections
 about future inflows cannot be made with any degree of accuracy and are
 therefore not particularly helpful. That’s why the Government is 
focused on dealing with the abuse of free movement rights and also 
reducing the pull factors for migration. We want to make sure that when 
people look at the access to our benefits and our public services that 
no one thinks we are a soft touch in this country.’

Concern: Immigration minister Mark Harper, left, says that the Government will ensure that the UK is no 'soft touch' when it comes to Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants, but Labour MP Keith Vaz, right, says the Government is 'confused' over the matter

An estimate by the MigrationWatch 
think-tank has suggested the number of arrivals will average 50,000 a 
year for the first five years – the equivalent of a city the size of 
Newcastle or Plymouth.

Tensions are rising among Tory MPs who want the Government to take firm action.

They fear David Cameron’s promise to 
reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ will be fatally 
undermined if large numbers arrive from Romania and Bulgaria, two of the
 poorest countries in the EU.

Currently, they are subject to 
transitional controls which limit the number of work permits available 
to low-skilled workers to around 20,000 a year. But, from the start of 
2014, these arrangements will be abandoned, giving workers free access 
to the UK jobs market.

Speaking at Home Office Questions, 
Tory Philip Hollobone said his constituents believed it was ‘madness to 
open our borders to 29million people’.

He called for ministers to force EU 
nationals who wanted to live in the UK for more than three months to 
apply for a residency card.

Immigration ministers are examining the UK's current welfare rules in a debate in the House of Commons

His colleague David Ruffley said 
action must be taken to curb ‘welfare tourism that can only add to 
British public spending’. Another Tory, James Clappison, asked Mr Harper
 specifically to comment on the MigrationWatch estimate of 50,000 a 
year. But Mr Harper repeatedly refused to provide any indication of 
numbers.

He said: ‘We want to make sure that we offer what we need to under the treaties, but no more.’

Ministers say they do not want to 
create ‘scare’ stories – which some MPs have taken to mean the figure is
 high. However, an alternative scenario is that the number produced by 
officials is low, and would make the Government a hostage to fortune. 
Labour has never recovered from saying a mere 13,000 people would come 
from Poland in 2004, only for hundreds of thousands of workers to 
arrive.

Last night there were new demands to publish the figures.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of 
MigrationWatch, said: ‘There is surely a need for an intelligent 
estimate. The worst option, surely, is just to muddle on.’

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the 
Home Affairs Select Committee, accused the Government of being 
‘confused’ on the issue and urged ministers to commission research on 
how many immigrants were likely to arrive.
