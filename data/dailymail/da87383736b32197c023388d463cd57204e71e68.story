Sunderland defender Santiago Vergini believes fellow Argentine Ricky Alvarez will be a quality addition to the side following his deadline day move from Inter Milan.

Vergini is familiar with Alvarez after playing with him during his youth days at Velez Sarsfield and says the forward, on loan for the season from Inter Milan, will produce the goods for Sunderland.

He told the club's official website: 'He is technically very good, he has great physical potential and he can get up and down the field so I believe he will bring a lot to the team.

Confidence: Santiago Vergini is confident Ricky Alvarez will be a success at Sunderland

'Both for the club and the squad it is great that a player like Ricky will come here as it brings a lot of prestige.

'I imagine that he is a player that the fans will really take to and I think that he really is capable of doing great things.' 

As well as Alvarez Sunderland also signed Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates on a season-long loan as Gus Poyet's side look to build on their encouraging end to last season.
