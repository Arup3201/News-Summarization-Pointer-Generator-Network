Hewn ruthlessly from the earth by water over 270million years, these stone structures are a testament to the power of the natural world.

The pillars, arches and columns rise hundred of feet into the air over a vast region of southern China, striking awe into observers who have flocked to the area for thousands of years.

Known as karsts, the limestone structures - captured in these images for National Geographic Magazine - are created when water forces fissures, sinkholes, cracks and caverns into the soft rock, leaving only a series of monoliths above ground.

Vast: Jaw-dropping limestone 'karsts' formed by erosion over 270million years soar hundreds of feet into the air across a huge region of southern China. Pictured, climber Emily Harrington takes the hard way up Moon Hill, an arch which was formed from the remains of a collapsed cave. Sightseers can take an easier dirt track

Awe: The enormity of the structures is clear compared to the size of the cavers ascending them, from a limestone spire in the Enshi canyon (left) to the Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park (right). Seeing these sights can be much easier, as a new glass elevator delivers less intrepid tourists to the foot of the arch

China's Stone Forest is one of the 
largest, with huge arches which once belonged to cave systems but now 
protrude awkwardly above the lush green hills around.

Covering an estimated half a million square kilometres, south China's is one of the largest and most significant in the world.

While
 limestone structures are common, only in a humid, tropical environment 
can there be enough movement of water to create such dramatic change, 
and form structures which have earned the South China Karst recognition 
as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

But
 just as with an iceberg, what can be seen in these photographs is only 
the tip. The flowing water has not only carved up the landscape above 
the ground, but has also transformed it below.

South
 China is home to some of the largest caves in the world, which even now
 are still being mapped and explored by researchers from around the 
world.

Heading the charge 
is a team led by Andy Eavis, the chairman of the British Caving 
Association who has been traveling to China for more than 30 years.

Otherworldly: The landscape was formed by water in the humid region seeping in through cracks in porous rock and gradually opening up sinkholes, fissures and caves

All work and no play...: Those pictured have devoted their careers to exploring and mapping the hostile cave landscape down below - but do come up for air occasionally

Map: Beneath southern China's landscape researchers have discovered some of the largest underground chambers in the world. In 2013 a British-led expedition used a laser scanner to map the Miao Room of Gebihe, pictured, whose maximum height is 627 feet. A passenger jet is shown for scale

He and his explorers have used 
pioneering laser scanners to map the complex, unstable systems in 
unprecedented detail, including the Miao Room of the Gebihe cave system -
 since confirmed as the second-largest known cavern in the world.

Despite
 its entrance from the outer world comprising just a narrow, unobtrusive
 gap in stone in the forest, it has a maximum height of 627 feet.

The
 cavern must be explored in hostile conditions - including high humidity
 and a lack of any natural light - using a mixture of computer 
technology and old-fashioned caving bravery.

With
 fissures and sharp points of rock, a wrong step could mean injury or 
death, and the cavern is so large it could fit a fleet of jumbo jets 
with plenty of room to spare.

Other
 caves are less formidable. In one part of the region, an entire village
 of 21 homes - with no need for rooves - is situated inside a cavern 
together with a primary school, a basketball court, and an increasing 
stream of tourists.

More still have been made safe for people to explore without the risk of losing their hats.

It 
is not all work and no play for the explorers. Some feature in these 
photos, where they take time off from their caving work to ascend the 
other side of China's fantasy landscape.

That
 is despite there being far more tourist-friendly ways to ascend the 
limestone structures, which are mainly in China's Yunnan, Guizhou and 
Guangxi provinces.

One, the
 Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park, includes a glass 
elevator which delivers the less intrepid to the foot of the arch so 
they do not have to climb.

It is a vision of the future - and it's predicted the caves will be next.

With
 China becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, 
tourists from other parts of the vast nation are already streaming 
underground - though how long it will take to install a glass lift there
 remains to be seen.
