A mother has spoken of her devastation following the death of her baby boy who died of whooping cough despite doctors sending him home three times. 

Cavani-Cruz was born a healthy 6lb 13oz on February 4 at King's College Hospital but nine days later his mother Semray Mentes was forced to bring him back because he was vomiting and had a runny nose and cough. 

Semray says she was treated like a 'silly 18-year-old' by medics.

Cavani-Cruz was born a healthy 6lb 13oz on February 4 at King's College Hospital but within a month died

When doctors finally put him on a life support machine they misdiagnosed his illness as bronchiolitus, Semray claims. 

In total she was sent home three times by doctors she says.

During one occasion Semray says she was advised to give Cavani-Cruz Gaviscon infant powder to mix into his bottles. 

The child was finally admitted on his fourth visit but Cavani-Cruz died at midnight on March 14 with his parents and family by his bedside.

Semray says she was treated like a 'silly 18-year-old' by medics when she took her son back to hospital

In April a post mortem examination concluded that the little boy had been suffering from untreated whooping cough which led to organ failure. 

Semray told The Sunday Mirror: 'If my baby had been diagnosed correctly he would still be here. I want to do everything in my power to get justice for my son and to stop this from happening to other families.' 

Semray is also taking action against the midwife service because she claims she was not offered a whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy.

Semray and her partner Ben Pell, 24, have made a formal complaint against King's College Hospital in London

A King's College Hospital spokesman said: 'We have explained to Ms Mentes that Cavani was seen by specialist paediatric doctors on each visit to King's. Having looked in detail at the case, we consider the correct clinical treatment and advice was provided on each occasion.'
