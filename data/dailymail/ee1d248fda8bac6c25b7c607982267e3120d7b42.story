Hockey forward Andrew Shaw is auctioning on eBay the stitches he received during a winning Stanley Cup Final for charity.

The Chicago Blackhawks player is selling his framed 12 stitches accompanied by his autograph plus a few other items to raise money for cancer.

Shaw needed his upper cheek to be stitched together after a hefty whack in the face by the puck, during the first period of Game Six on June 24.

Charitable: Andrew Shaw, Number 65 of the Chicago Blackhawks, was hit in the face with a puck during the Stanley Cup Final. He is auctioning off the stitches he received for charity

The framed stitches, together with Mr Shaw's autograph and a few other items, will be sold on eBay - 100 per cent of the final bid price will benefit the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research

The player fell to the ice and lay motionless for a few seconds before he was helped off to the changing rooms for treatment.

The injured forward later returned to the Cup Final to help the Hawks win their second cup in four seasons, according to ESPN.com.

The news service quotes Joel Alpert, the AM sports marketing group owner, as saying: 'Immediately after the finals, I suggested to Andrew that he keeps his stitches as we could use them to raise money for a good cause.'

He continued: 'Andrew said he wanted to support breast cancer research, and from there we came up with the auction concept.'

The final amount raised will be donated to the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research - a charity founded by the late ESPN commentator and former basketball star and coach, Jim Valveno (1946-1993).

Jimmy lost his battle with metastatic adenocarcinoma 20 years ago, but in his last year of life, he vowed to try to help as many cancer sufferers as possible.

The charity has promised that any funds raised will go directly to grants to support breast cancer research.

According to the news service, Mr Shaw scored five goals and set up four more during the Stanley Cup playoffs.

The final score, against the Boston Bruins, was 0:1 in the first period, 1:0 in the second; and 2:1 in the third, meaning the Chicago team just clinched the cup by 3:2.
