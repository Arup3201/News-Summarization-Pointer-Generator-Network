West Brom spent a record £10million on a player manager Alan Irvine has admitted he has never seen play.

The Baggies shelled out on the Dynamo Kiev star Ideye Brown after taking advice from club scouts and watching DVDs.

And while the move will raise some eyebrows, Irvine is perfectly happy he's made the right move in spending such a huge amount of the club's cash.

New boss: And Baggies manager Alan Irvine has admitted he's never seen him play

Irvine said: 'It would be fantastic if he could have the same impact as Peter Odemwingie did.

'I don’t know much about Brown Ideye – I’ve not seen him live, but people we trust have done.

'It’s not necessarily something that is detrimental to me not to have seen him live, though ideally I would like to because that’s how I like to do my work.

'But we’ve done our research on him and what we have done is found decent players in the past in this way.'
