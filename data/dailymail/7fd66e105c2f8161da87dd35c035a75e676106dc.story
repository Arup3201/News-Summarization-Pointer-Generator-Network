A young mother has committed suicide by walking in front of a semi-trailer the same day her 14-month-old son mysteriously died at their home, authorities said.

Police in Canton, Ohio, discovered little Omoyele Gonzalez dead in a bed at the property in the 1600 block of 10th Street just after 7.30 p.m. Thursday. He had no obvious injuries and a subsequent autopsy has proved inconclusive.

Officers were called to the home because the child's mother, Kayelisa Martin, 20, was threatening suicide, according to a Canton police press release. Around the same time, a family member went to the nearby Canton Fire Station No. 7 to report that the toddler was dead.

When law enforcement arrived, however, Martin wasn't there. They tried to locate her, but soon received word that the devastated mother had died in a traffic incident in nearby Summit County.

Tragic: Young mother Kayelisa Martin, pictured, committed suicide Thursday by walking in front of a semi-trailer the same day her 14-month-old son Omoyele, pictured with her, mysteriously died at a Canton, Ohio, home, authorities said

According to the press release, Martin 'committed suicide by walking in front of a moving vehicle on I-77 at Milepost 115,' near Akron-Canton Airport.

A Summit County sheriff's office release states that she was struck when she stepped in front of a semi-trailer. 

The northbound lanes were closed for about four hours after the tragic incident and traffic was detoured around the scene.

Stark County Coroner's office conducted an autopsy on the toddler Saturday and results released Monday offered little insight into how the adorable toddler died.

'Preliminary autopsy findings showed that the child did not die of any trauma,' coroner P.S. Murthy said in a statement.

The office is awaiting toxicology results but confirmed X-rays showed there had been no recent or past abuse, nor did Omoyele die from injuries consistent with a fall or from an infection.

The child's father does not live at the home. Police said they have interviewed him and they don't believe he was involved.

Gary Guenther, investigator for the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office, said Friday that Martin's autopsy showed she died of 'blunt force trauma to the head and torso.'

He said she was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to the Canton Repository, the child and his mother were involved in a car crash earlier Thursday in Canal Fulton, though its unclear if it has any relevance to their later deaths.

The crash occurred at 6:35 a.m. Thursday in the 2100 block of Locust Street, according to a crash report released Friday by Canal Fulton police.

Martin told police she lost control of her black 2007 Nissan Maxima when the wheel started to shake and she couldn't stop, the report said.

The car went up over a curb, struck a fire hydrant, hit shrubs and landscaping rocks in two separate yards and then traveled across a parking lot before coming to a stop.

The mother was cited for operating a vehicle without reasonable control, according to the Repository.

The family have set up a fundraising page to pay for the mother and baby's funeral services. To donate click here.
