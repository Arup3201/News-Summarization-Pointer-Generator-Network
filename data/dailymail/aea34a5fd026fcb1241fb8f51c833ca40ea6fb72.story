A former British boxing champion accused of helping two men flee to Syria to fight with Islamic State (ISIS) will stand trial in June.

Anthony Small, 33, who won both the British and Commonwealth championships in 2009, appeared at the Old Bailey alongside four other men today.

Small allegedly helped Michael Coe, 33, and Simon Keeler 43, in their attempt to travel to Syria. Coe and Keeler were arrested at Dover on 30 November.

All three men are charged with preparation, and assisting others in preparation, of acts of terrorism, support of the organisation ISIS and conspiracy to possess false identity documents.

Zagum Perviaz, 35, is charged with conspiring to possess and produce false identity documents.

The defendants appeared in court via videolink from HMP Belmarsh and HMP Wormwood Scrubs and spoke only to confirm their names during the short hearing.

Hamzah Safdar, 24, of Plaistow, East London, pleaded guilty to conspiring to make fake passports and driving licences.

He will be sentenced after the trial of his co-accused.

They will stand trial on 8 June which is expected to last six to eight weeks. Judge Mr Justice Saunders remanded all five of the men in custody.

Small, of Southend Lane, Beckenham, south-east London, is charged with two counts of preparation of terrorist acts, supporting a terrorist organisation and possession of a false identity document.

Coe, of East Ham, East London, is also charged with two counts of preparation of terrorist acts, support of a proscribed organisation and possession of a false passport and driving licence.

Safdah also pleaded not guilty to two charges of possession of a false passport and driving licence, which was accepted by the prosecution.

None of the other defendants have entered pleas to any of the charges against them.

The charges were brought after two men were allegedly found among migrants in a lorry at the Port of Dover
