A mother was left gobsmacked when she left the hospital with her newborn daughter to be greeted by balloons, a white stallion and a break dancing group.

Olga Puntus from Minsk in Belarus told husband Sergey, 26, not to go over the top over the birth of their first daughter Lisa, but she might as well have saved her breath.  

Not only was there a throne and a Rolls-Royce, but the doting dad had even drummed up a brass band as well - all to greet her on her exit from the Belarus hospital.

Astonished Olga was ushered to a waiting Union Jack throne outside the hospital.

Sitting open-mouthed, she couldn't believe it when Sergey orchestrated a crowd of more than a hundred people to serenade his wife and daughter. 

An urban dance troupe followed with a hip-hop routine that spelled out their daughter's name in poses on the ground, while a modern choir sang a specially commissioned song in honour of the newborn.

Finally the businessman arrived on the back of a white stallion dressed as a king and clutching a bunch of flowers.

After showering his tearful wife and their daughter with kisses, soon the proud father whisked them home in a chauffeur driven Rolls-Royce Phantom limousine.

Sergey says: 'This is our first child. We have long planned and waited for her. For me, to be a father is a serious step, an important day in my life. So of course, I decided that my wife deserves the best greeting ever.

He adds: 'I wanted to celebrate this day and I wanted it to stay unforgettable. Everything that happened was a complete surprise for my wife.'

The tycoon admitted he'd had some help from a friend who ran an event organising company, but added: 'Lisa decided to come two weeks early so we had just a couple of days to get everything ready.'

An astonishing video of the performance has become an internet hit all across eastern Europe.

Olga says: 'When Sergey does anything he goes 100 per cent all the way. It's not often I'm speechless but he completely astounded me.'
