Britain has undergone a boom in self-employment as mothers seek out more flexible careers, the Bank of England claims.

Since 2008, the number of self-employed workers has risen by almost 700,000 from 3.8million to 4.5million.

One in seven people in employment now work for themselves, compared to one in eight before the recession.

The Bank said ‘large numbers’ of people had chosen to go freelance or set up their own business, in recent years, but the rise was particularly noticeable among women. 

While self-employment among men has remained ‘roughly flat’, more women now work for themselves so they can better juggle childcare, they said.

A report by the Bank noted ‘growing self-employment among female workers’, pushing up the overall rate in the U K.

‘Part of this rise could reflect the desire to maintain a work-family balance and flexibility of hours’, they said.

The Bank also reported a significant rise in so-called ‘silver entrepreneurs’, as more over 65s remained in the workforce.

They said: ‘Older workers are more likely to be self-employed than younger workers.

‘This is perhaps because they have accumulated more knowledge or experience to start businesses.

‘Or it could be because they prefer the greater flexibility that self-employment offers.

Growing numbers are now working well into their 70s as Britons live for longer.

The number of older workers increased after the default retirement age was abolished in 2011, making it illegal for employers to force staff to retire at 65.

The Bank said that around half the increase in self-employment in the last 10 years was associated with ‘the ageing of the workforce’.

Improvements in computer technology have made it easier for people to start their own business, the Bank said, with entrepreneurs able to sell their goods online instead of the ‘need for traditional bricks and mortar stores’.

Previously, critics have suggested the rise in self-employment was because those who lost their jobs during the economic crisis had been unable to find new ones.

But the Bank dismissed this theory and said the increase actually reflected a ‘longer-term trend’ in Britain.

It said: ‘While the recession may have pushed some workers into self-employment where they might otherwise have been unemployed, there is little evidence to suggest this was a major factor in the rise of self-employment.’

There was also a rise in the number of over 65s who are still in work, according to the figures (file image)

The Trades Union Congress said the most common part-time self-employed jobs for women were hairdressers and cleaners, which are typically low-paid.

They claimed that, while many women choose to work part-time, there had been ‘a marked increase in the number of women moving into part-time jobs since the recession because they couldn’t find full-time employment’.

Shadow Business Secretary and Labour MP Chuka Umunna also claimed self-employed people had been the hardest hit by the cost-of-living crisis and that incomes had fallen.

The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed yesterday disputed this bleak picture, however, and welcomed the Bank’s report.

Simon McVicker, of IPSE, said: ‘With the report categorically stating that the increase in those working for themselves has not happened out of economic necessity, it is hoped the report will sway those, most notably the Labour Party, still clinging to the belief that the rise of self-employment represents increased insecurity in the labour market.

‘The report supports the findings of our own research that has repeatedly shown the UK’s independent professionals to be masters of their own destiny rather than becoming their own boss out of enforced or hidden unemployment.

‘The self-employed now constitute almost 15 per cent of the workforce and have been the catalyst for economic growth and recovery in the UK and it is high time they are celebrated for this fact.’
