With her unique look and seemingly endless supply of energy, she has been the star of fashion week for the past few seasons.

But it seems that Cara Delevingne's love affair with the catwalk is coming to an end.

Hinting at the fact that success can take its toll, Cara, who walked in around 50 shows for the autumn/winter shows in February earlier this year, has branded fashion week 'horrible'.

Despite walking in around 50 shows last season, Cara Delevingne has branded fashion week 'horrible'

In an interview with Industrie magazine about the start of fashion week, the model confessed: 'Fashion Week is horrible.'

However, she quickly explained: 'I mean it isn't horrible really, it's amazing. But having to work that much every day is.

'What I find hard is having to deal with all the people and all the c**p. It's when the press and fans are following me most, and it's when I work the hardest, so it's kind of like, f***.'

Last month Cara Delevingne hinted she may quit the fashion industry because her psoriasis worsens when she is stressed.

The 21-year-old told how Kate Moss encouraged her to seek medical advice after spotting her condition at Paris Fashion Week in March.

The stress-induced skin condition, which causes unsightly red sores, had flared up while they were working together.

Cara
 said: ‘It only happened during the Fashion Weeks, which are, of course,
 the worst time of year for me to be covered in scabs. Psoriasis is an 
auto-immune disease, and I’m sensitive.

'Kate Moss saw me before the Louis Vuitton show at 3am when I was being painted by people to cover the scabs.

‘She said, “This is horrible! Why is this happening? I need to help you”. She got me a doctor that afternoon.’

Onlookers
 had already noticed the sores at a Versace show at Milan Fashion Week 
in February, but assumed they were bruises. After the show, Miss 
Delevingne tweeted: ‘Be gone psoriasis, you’re no fun.’

Those bushy brows and razor-sharp cheekbones were the stars of last season, but will Cara return to the catwalk?

The
 model now has career plans that will be kinder to her skin. She said: 
‘I want to make music, I want to act and I want to sing. I want to do 
something that doesn’t make my skin erupt.’

Despite her conflicting views on fashion week, Cara was the star attraction on the 
Marc Jacobs catwalk in New York last night.

Despite a rather unflattering cropped blonde wig 
covering her long locks, ever the professional she carried the bizarre look off with aplomb as she walked 
the grassy runway for the flamboyant designer.

And
 with London Fashion Week kicking off in the capital today, it is yet to
 be revealed whether the model-of-the-moment will be walking in any 
shows.

The 21-year-old has been focusing her attention on her acting career and reportedly has a lead role in a Chris Foggin film which she was recently spotted filming with the rest of the
 cast, including Alma Jodorowsky, Sebastian D'Souza, Preston Thompson and Gala 
Gordon.

Kids In Love is said to be about a group of young Londoners who spend their days partying and taking drugs.
