Painters have been left red-faced after using a 'glaring tomato' shade instead of terracotta to repaint a Grade II-listed Victorian building.Â 

The bright hue has left drivers 'dazzled' after passing the Royal Victoria Hospital Annexe, in Dover, Kent and the council has been inundated with complaints.

The Royal Victoria Hospital annexe in Dover Kent, has been given a paint job in a shade of 'tomato red'

Locals were horrified by the sight of the newly decorated red rooftop

Now, the decorators must put scaffolding back 
up to repair the 40ft-high building, now converted to 
flats.

The former hospital annexe - built in 
1877 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee - is considered one of
Dover's finest pieces of Victorian architecture.

Locals have said the flats are 'glaring tomato red', with some even saying the paint job has 'dazzled them' while driving.

Accounts worker Sam Graham, 37, said: 'Every time I drive past the building I get dazzled by the paint.

'The first time I saw it I nearly swerved into another car - they really need to get it sorted soon.'

The rules when redecorating or renovating listed properties are that any changes must be in keeping with the original character of the building.

Care must be taken to preserve and enhance the period features, by choosing the same materials that were used originally.

Listed Building Consent is needed for all kinds of work that involves alterations which affect the character of a listed building of special architectural or historic interest, which is determined by the local authority.

If the property is in a conservation area, additional 'Article 4 Directions' apply, such as replacing a window with one of a similar design. For example, when replacing windows in a Victorian house, wooden frames are more appropriate than uPVC.

James Robinson, who has lived in 
Dover for more than 50 years, said: 'It's one of our finest buildings, 
it survived the war but now look at it.

'It looks absolutely ridiculous. What moron did it and thought it looked acceptable?'One
high street businessman, who asked not to be named, took his objections
to the Dover Society, which in turn took the matter up with the 
District Council.

He said: 'The painting work seems so unnecessary, as the brickwork painted over was in good condition in the first place.'

Bosses at Sanctuary Housing, which owns 
the flats, have admitted that workers failed to match the 'terracotta 
colour' and that re-painting had been arranged.

A spokesman said: 'When refreshing paintwork on the flats, the terracotta colour wasn't matched correctly.

'We have been working with the local planning department in response to enquiries, and have arranged for the building to be re-painted.'

A spokesman for Dover District Council said: 'We have spoken to the owners who have given us assurances that they will repaint the building a more acceptable colour in the very near future.'
