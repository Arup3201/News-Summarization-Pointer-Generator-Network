A Syrian oil pipeline was blown up today in what has been described by the government as an act of sabotage by an armed terrorist group.

The pipeline, carrying oil from the east of the country to a vital refinery in Homs, spilled flames and clouds of thick black smoke into the air over the city, which has been the epicentre of the protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

'This is the main pipeline that feeds the Homs refinery,' said Rami Abdulrahman of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Blackout: The pipeline was a major one, carrying oil from the east of the country to a vital refinery in Homs, which is the home of the anti-Assad protests

Randon shootings: Human rights observers have also reported seven people killed in Homs today by snipers

The Observatory also reported seven people killed in Homs today by snipers and in 'random' shootings.  

The ferocity of Assad's crackdown on protests triggered desertions from the armed forces, and now thousands of army defectors have joined a guerrilla army staging hit-and-run attacks on security forces.         

The state news agency, SANA, said the pipeline was attacked in the Tal Asour area to the northwest of the refinery on the outskirts of Homs, a city of 800,000 where - activists say - about 1,500 people have been killed in the crackdown.

The Homs refinery serves part of Syria's domestic requirement for refined oil products.

It is the second attack on an oil pipeline after SANA said saboteurs blew up an oil export pipeline near Homs in June, which carried oil from Syria's eastern oilfields to the Mediterranean coast.

Anti-Assad activists are looking to step up their activity by calling for a nationwide strike on Sunday - a working day - as the first stage in a campaign of civil disobedience against Assad's government.

The Local Coordination Committees, the grassroots organisers of the peaceful protest movement said the campaign would include sit-ins, shop closures and strikes by public service workers and students.        

A similar call for a walkout two months ago had mixed results. Shops and businesses in the southern province of Deraa, cradle of Syria's eight-month-old popular revolt, shut for eight days at the end of October.        

Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 41 years, has denied ordering his troops to kill peaceful protesters, saying only a "crazy" leader kills his own people.    

In a television interview with ABC news of the United States he distanced himself from the actions of the security forces, saying it was not his personal army - a disclaimer that Washington said was simply not credible.              

Assad is under growing international pressure, including a threat of sanctions from the Arab League, to cease violent repression of protests.

Rejecting criticism of his government's action, he told ABC News that 'most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government, not the vice versa'.       

Syrian activists say around a quarter of the more than 4,500 deaths they have recorded in nine months of protest have been among the security forces.

Most foreign media have been excluded from Syria, making it hard to verify events independently.

In the city of Homs and nearby areas in northwestern Syria people staged a general strike on October 26, partly enforced by armed insurgents.   But the two biggest cities of Damascus and Aleppo were largely unaffected, and residents of the capital said on Thursday that authorities appeared to be taking steps to thwart Sunday's planned action.   

Some shopkeepers who sought to pay their bills to the government this week said they were told to wait until Sunday when officials would visit their premises to collect the money - a veiled warning not to be closed.            

One resident also reported increased numbers of police and plainclothes security forces in Damascus. 'Every 10 metres you find a group of them, wearing normal clothes,' she said.         

Meanwhile, Russia has called on Nato to stay out of Syria's business or risk inflaming sectarian tensions that could 'blow this whole geopolitical space up'.                 

Russia, along with China, vetoed a European-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution in October that would have condemned Syria for a violent crackdown on the mass anti-government protests and threatened it with potential sanctions.          

Speaking at Nato headquarters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated Moscow's unhappiness at the way a Security Council resolution this year had been cited as the basis for a Nato operation that helped to topple Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.

'When a crisis emerges, all political, religious and other forces should be... encouraged to participate in dialogue,' he said after meeting his Nato counterparts.         

Lavrov said outsiders should not 'pick and choose the sweethearts', and groups within a country that called for outside help were taking 'the wrong path'.

'Not seeing threats that emanate from the current trends would be wrong, in my view, because those processes that are deeply rooted might come to the surface and blow this whole geopolitical space up,' said Lavrov.    

'We are, to be very frank with you, extremely concerned with the fact that we are seeing (a) growing divide within the Islamic world, between the Sunni and the Shi'ite.

'Unless we help reverse this negative trend, we might witness very dire events.'      

Speaking at a news conference after Lavrov, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reiterated that the alliance had 'no intention whatsoever to intervene in Syria'.      

The United Nations says more than 4,000 people have been killed in the crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad's government.
