Kerry Washington looks stunning on the the latest cover of Marie Claire - but more importantly the Scandal star looks like herself, following last month's controversy in which InStyle came under fire for allegedly altering her appearance on its March issue.

Marie Claire's cover shot featuring the beautiful 38-year-old actress, who donned a smokey eye, tousled hair and nude lips for the magazine's April issue, is a far cry from the unnatural-looking pictures that InStyle had debuted over a month ago.

When Kerry happily shared the InStyle images on her Instagram last February, fans became outraged, accusing the magazine of allegedly whitening her skin and altering her features - which InStyle quickly denied.

The fashion publication apologized to fans and released a statement in which it blamed the actress' seemingly altered skin tone on the 'lighting' used during the cover shoot.

'We have heard from those who have spoken out about our newsstand cover photograph, concerned that Kerry's skin tone was lightened,' InStyle said. 

'While we did not digitally lighten Kerry's skin tone, our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern.'

The magazine added: 'We understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt. We are listening, and the feedback has been valuable. We are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward.'

Posting on her own Twitter account, Kerry thanked the publication for making such a 'beautiful statement', adding that she was grateful the magazine had taken the time to open up such an 'important' conversation.

Yesterday, Kerry proudly shared the Marie Claire cover on her Instagram account and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

'Obsessed with this cover,' one woman wrote.

Another added: 'Yup, this is Kerry Washington the beautiful! Great cover.'

Beyond the stunning cover shot, Kerry, who was interviewed by Girls star and author Lena Dunham for the publication, discussed motherhood, privacy and her hopes and dreams for her nearly one-year-old daughter Isabelle as she grows up.

'I just want [Isabelle] to know that she's heard. Really heard, because I feel like that is what we all really want,' she explained.

'When I think about any of the missteps in my life that I've made, all of which I'm grateful for, it's because I just so wanted to be truly seen and heard for who I am and was afraid I wasn't or wouldn't be.'

She added: 'I see you, I hear you, I'm with you as you are.'

Kerry also noted that she never felt particularly beautiful when she was younger. 

The actress, who attended the Spence School in Manhattan with Gwyneth Paltrow, noted: 'I didn't grow up thinking I was pretty.

'There was always a prettier girl than me. So I learned to be smart and tried to be funny and develop the inside of me, because I felt like that's what I had.'
