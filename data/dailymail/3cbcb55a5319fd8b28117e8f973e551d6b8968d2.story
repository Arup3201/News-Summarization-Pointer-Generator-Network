Petrol head pensioner Barry Moore is Jaguar's most loyal customer - after buying his 47th car made by the iconic British manufacturer.

The 74-year-old purchased his first Jaguar - a Mark 7 Saloon - over half a century ago in 1960, for a reasonable £475.

Over the next 53 years Mr Moore, from Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, has gone on to spend a staggering half a million pounds on more than 25 different models of the luxury car.

Cat lover: Barry Moore, 74 is Jaguar's most loyal customer after purchasing his 47th model, a Jaguar XF3.OD

Mr Moore from Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, has travelled all over Europe in his favourite models

And last week the retired company director returned to the same dealership he bought his first Jag from to fork out £70,000 for a swanky new F-Type convertible.

The loyal motorist got the keys to his 3-litre, super-charged, 380 break horsepower vehicle on Thursday and says it's the best one yet.

Amazingly, the car mad OAP has purchased all 47 of his cars from the same local dealership - HA Fox Jaguar in Nottingham.

The most Mr Moore has ever spent in one purchase was £160,000 for two XKR's - one for him and one for his wife - and at times he has bought up to five Jaguars in just a single year.

Icon: The motorist calls Jaguar a 'British institution'

Despite the many varied models he has owned, Mr Moore says he is unable to pick out a favourite

He said: 'I have had tried various other
cars over the years - I have tried Mercedes, BMW and Audi but have 
always gone back to Jaguar.

'They are always a balance between a nice quick car and a good handling car, with quality and traditional interior.

'I've spent £509,000 on them in total - but you only live once and I've had a lot of fun in them.

'It's hard to choose my favourite over the years.

'The latest one I've got is one of the best I think - they seem to get better and better.'

Shared passion: His wife Grace, who died in 2010, also had his love of travel and Jaguars

Glittering: In one year he bought five different cars - all Jaguar

The one model that he is not so keen on is the XJ Saloon (not pictured)

Mark-up: The turquoise E-Type he sold for a £7,000 profit in 1982

He added: 'The XF Saloon was great, and the E Type was brilliant - but I like them all for different reasons.

'The only one I'm not so keen on is the XJ Saloon, which is driven by the Prime Minister.

'I always try to buy British, we all know Jaguar have been bought out by an Indian company, but factories still provide plenty of work for British people.

'It is an iconic British institution.'

Mr Moore has only ever made a profit on one of his cars, a turquoise E Type, which he bought for £3,000 and sold on for £10,000 in 1982.

His love for Jaguar was also shared with his wife Grace, who died in 2010.

Mr Moore has tried other luxury car manufacturers, but always finds himself coming back to Jaguar

They had a car each and would enjoy travelling around Europe, as far as Germany, France, Spain and the former Yugoslavia.

He added: 'When you go away in a car, you see such a lot and you can stay in a place as long as you like.

'In a car you have more freedom. We never had any children so we could go wherever we wanted really.

'Grace would go for the more sporty versions, while I would have the more powerful cars.

'I think I pushed her into it a little bit though. But she definitely did like Jaguars. I made sure of that.'

Tim Bull, sales manager at HA Fox Nottingham, said: 'I think I've sold him 21 cars personally - he is definitely our most loyal customer.

'Some years he buys two of three - there's very few people like him out there. Most people would think 'I bet that's easy' - but he drives a hard deal.

'He certainly knows how to negotiate a price, that's for sure.'

However, it is not known whether Jaguar offers him a further discount after his decades of staggering loyalty. The F Type sells for between £58,000 to £80,000.
