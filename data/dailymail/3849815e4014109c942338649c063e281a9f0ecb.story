Mother: Rockell Coleman, 28 (pictured), was charged with two counts of felony murder and five counts of cruelty to children on Saturday after two of her sons died in a house fire

A mother-of-five has been charged with murder after her two youngest children died in a house fire this weekend.

Authorities believe 28-year-old mother Rockell Coleman left her five sons, ages three to 10, in the Decatur, Georgia home alone when the mysterious fire broke out Friday.

But family of the young mother say she was at a restaurant with friends, and that her children were supposed to be in the care of a female roommate. 

On Saturday, a judge denied bond for Coleman after she was charged with two counts of felony murder and five counts of cruelty to children in the second degree. 

Authorities are still investigating what caused the fire to break out on Friday night. 

Firefighters responding to the scene found two of Coleman's sons outside, with the remaining three trapped inside. 

The youngest brothers, 3-year-old Haskel and 4-year-old Preston died at the scene. 

Ten-year-old Jarvis was rushed to Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta to be put on life support, while his younger brothers AJ, 9, and Shamari, 5, are in better condition.

Family and friends are now praising Coleman's 9-year-old son AJ as a hero, saying he rescued two of his brothers from the house and tried to go back in to get the rest but was stopped by responding firefighters.

'He got Jarvis out and got Shamari out and when he went back in to get the babies, the fireman stopped him,' AJ's uncle Christopher Marion told WSB-TV.

Coleman's mother Lydia Pinckney is also defending her daughter, saying she didn't leave her children alone. 

Ms Pinckney told 11Alive that her son's ex-girlfriend had moved in with Coleman three weeks prior and was supposed to be looking after the children that night while Coleman went to a restaurant with friends. 

She says family haven't been able to contact her since the fire, although CBS 46 reports that the woman has been posting to Facebook.

What's left: Family members are praising Coleman's 9-year-old son AJ, who allegedly got two of his brothers out of the house and then tried to go back into the burning building to get his two other brothers inside, but was stopped by firefighters 

Wasn't her fault: Coleman's mother Lydia Pinckney (left) claims her son's ex-girlfriend was supposed to be babysitting the five children the night the house fire broke out, and that she hasn't been able to contact the woman since. On the right, a memorial at the site of the fire 

'As my daughter told the police , [name redacted] was supposed to be watching them that night when all of this happened, but from that night to now, it's like she disappeared from the face of the earth,' Ms Pinckney said, adding that police did not believe her daughter's story. 

Ms Pinckney also claims her daughter was so distraught to lose her youngest children, that she had to be sedated when she was brought into custody, and was still under the influence of the drugs when police questioned her.

'For them to take my daughter down and to question her while she was still under narcotics - I'm not understanding why you would question somebody that you knew had got heavily sedated while they were in the emergency room,' Ms Pinckney said. 

Ms Pinckney is now struggling to pay for the funeral costs of her two grandchildren, since her daughter did not have insurance for the boys.  

Coleman is due back in court on January 5.
