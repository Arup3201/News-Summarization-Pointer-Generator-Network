There's only one thing more scary than a pack of rugby players…and that’s the wives of a pack of rugby players letting their hair down.

Zara Phillips led the way yesterday as she and a group of fellow ‘scrummies’ enjoyed Ladies’ Day at Cheltenham.

Wearing a bright red coat, the Queen’s granddaughter collapsed into fits of giggles as Siobhan Brown, wife of Gloucester rugby player Alex Brown, pulled faces for the camera and threw her arm around the royal.

Girls just wanna have fun! Zara Phillips was joined by her glamorous friends for the Gloucestershire race meet's Ladies Day

Having fun, girls? Zara and pals were clearly game for a laugh as they messed around before racing got underway

Wrapped up warm: Princess Anne and Zara Phillips shared a joke as they arrived at Cheltenham race course for Ladies Day

Among those joining them at the 
racing were 31-year-old Miss Phillips’ best friend Dolly Maude – the 
maid of honour at her 2011 wedding to former England rugby captain Mike 
Tindall – Kate Wood, the wife of Gloucester rugby player Nick Wood, and 
several wives and girlfriends from the club, for whom Tindall plays.

Anticipating a boozy day ahead for 
his wife Annika, Gloucester rugby player Huia Edmonds sent a tweet to 
Mrs Maude, saying: ‘Annika loves tequila so plenty of it for her 
tomorrow please?’ Miss Phillips seemed to be cheered by spending some 
quality time with her friends yesterday.

Goofing around: Zara in the parade ring (she was allowed in this time!)

Top titfer: Zara kept things simple with black accessories that let her coat do the talking

Just 24 hours earlier, she was 
photographed having a row with a security guard, who failed to recognise
 her and tried to block her from crossing the parade ring while the 
horses passed.

Yesterday, female punters covered up 
more than usual for Ladies’ Day as temperatures struggled to rise above 
4C. Fur was once again the clothing of choice for many and there was an 
abundance of feathered hats.

Things however became heated when a 
cheating row broke out over the coveted Ladies’ Day Best Dressed Fashion
 Awards. Contenders claimed the competition had been marred by entries 
from professional designers who used the event to plug their brands.

Racing fans: Zara was joined by Mike Tindall, also at Cheltenham for a second day running

Don't you know who I am? The royal had trouble getting in yesterday thanks to an overzealous security man

ELSEWHERE AT LADIES DAY...

Stephanie King from Newmarket opted for a fantastical butterfly hat design made from peacock feathers while an elaborate headpiece was worn with a cosy fur scarf

Glammed up: Brightly dressed girls brave the chill

Brrrr. glamorous punter Fawn Beddows chose a plunging playsuit for Ladies day but she didn't seem to mind the chilly weather and put on a brave front for the cameras

And they're off! Ruby Walsh on Pont Alexandre, left, leads Tony McCoy on Taquin du Seuil and Barry Geraghty on Chatterbox on the first circuit of the Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham today

Braving the chill: The March cold snap did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of the crowds, who gathered at the parade ring to watch Barry Geraghty ride in on Sprinter Sacre after winning the Queen Mother Champion Steeple Chase

The Queen's granddaughter, who had arrived at the Gloucestershire race course earlier today with mother Princess Anne, was sure to stand out at the meet, wearing a vivid red military style double-breasted Paul Costelloe coat paired with black accessories and a peacock-feather trim pillbox.

The coat is from the Irish designer's Autumn/Winter 2013 Dressage collection, which showed on the catwalk at London Fashion Week last month.

Costelloe is one of Zara's preferred designers - thanks to his smart, polished aesthetic - and she has a number of his pieces.

For two days running Zara has wrapped up warm in wool coats from Costelloe, one of her go-to designers.

Catwalk queen: The £300 red coat Zara wore today was from the A/W13 Dressage collection shown by Paul Costelloe at London Fashion Week last month, while the cream angora-wool mix coat was shown as part of the London Fashion Week collection (POA)

Today's was a red military dresscoat in 
British lambswool coat with gold buttons from Paul Costelloe's A/W13 
Dressage collection, relaunched last month at London Fashion Week. The 
coat, which will retail for £300, is not yet available to buy.

The coat Zara wore yesterday was from the Paul Costelloe London Fashion Week collection, and is a wool-angora mix swing coat with crystal button detail, Peter Pan collar and pleated detail on the back.
