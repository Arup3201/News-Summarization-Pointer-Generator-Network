A woman who tried to dine out alone on Valentine's Day is suing a restaurant claiming they refused to serve her when she showed up for her reservation.

Kathleen Hampton of Portland, Oregon says she was 'distraught' when after a day spent with her husband, she decided to go to dinner alone when he told her he was too full from their lunch date.

But when she showed up at Enzo’s Caffe Italiano, she claims that from the moment she arrived the entire staff did everything in their power to get her to leave the establishment. 

Now, she is suing them for $100,000 and demanding an apology.

Hampton showed up for her dinner reservation without her husband and claims the staff waited to seat her and eventually asked her to leave

'I had a strange feeling when I got there but I didn’t think anything about it until the next set of incidences happen,' said Hampton in court documents obtained by KOIN.

Hampton said she arrived for her reservation and said she was alone, and was told there would be a wait.

Shortly after, she claims, the staff began seating people who had arrived after her to the restaurant.

Then, when she finally was seated at her table, things got even worse for the single diner.

'I finally said I was ready to order, she told me that she was not taking my order and I had to leave and give up my table,' Hampton alleges in her lawsuit.

She also claims that she does not believe it was solely the fact that she was single that caused this shocking service

'I didn’t fit their decor in there,' she said. 

'I was the only African American.'

And so, she ended up leaving the establishment.

'I cried, I’ve never been so embarrassed and humiliated in my life,' she said. 

Owner Enzo Lanzadoro (above) claims he would never refuse service to a customer, and that they simply asked to move her to the bar

The owner of Enzo's, Enzo Lanzadoro, disputes these statements however, and tells a far different story.

He shoots down the claims of racial discrimination and says that they simply asked Hampton to move to the bar and give up the table as it was such a busy night and they needed the space for another couple after her husband failed to show.

'The waiter came over, I’m so sorry, it’s a busy night, we need to move you to the bar because we need the other chair,' Lanzadoro said. 

'It’s Valentine’s night.'

Hampton says this never happened, and that she was so excited to eat at Enzo's that she would have gladly taken a seat at the bar.

Lanzadoro said she is free to stop by the restaurant any time to try and work things out, and that he would never refuse service to a customer.
