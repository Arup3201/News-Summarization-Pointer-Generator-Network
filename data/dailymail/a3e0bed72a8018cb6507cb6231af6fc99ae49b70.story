Survivor: Schoolboy Joe Compton, pictured with his mother Emma Dean, is lucky to be alive after being struck by lightning

An 11-year-old boy is lucky to be alive after suffering a cardiac arrest, electric shock and severe burns when he was struck by lightning right outside his school in Britain's worst storm in 30 years. 

Pupil Joe Compton was waiting by the school gates to be collected from Dorcan Academy in Swindon when he was suddenly hit by a lightning bolt around 3pm.

First aiders who came to the rescue of 
Joe Compton found him unconscious, face down in the mud outside the school in Wiltshire.

The 11-year-old had suffered a cardiac 
arrest, electric shock and severe burns and was rushed to Great Western Hospital for emergency treatment. 

But after several weeks being treated for severe burns across 22 per cent of his body and burst ear drums at Bristol’s Frenchay Hospital following the freak incident on September 26, the youngster has finally been allowed to go home.

His mother, Emma Dean, admits there were concerns her son would not pull through and says he is lucky to still be alive.

She told the Swindon Advertiser: 'I thought he was going to die.

'When he was transferred to Frenchay, the specialist burns surgeon said he had never dealt with a lightning strike in his 25 years in the job.

'Lots of people who get hit by lightning don’t survive so Joe is very lucky and so are we.'

Joe underwent a careful treatment programme at the hospital, which included surgery for skin grafts, and will be fitted with a special body 
suit next month to help with his recovery from the burns.

He said: 'I do feel kind of lucky and I feel all right now.
I can’t really remember anything that happened that day or even waking 
up in the hospital but I know I had detention after school so I was a 
little bit late coming out.

Help on hand: Joe immediately went into cardiac arrest and first aiders from a neighbouring leisure centre (pictured right from left to right, Stuart Arthur, Steph Watts, Stephanie Woodman, Ben Clinch, and Jenny Hatter) rushed to administer CPR until paramedics arrived six minutes later

'I don’t remember the pain at the time or afterwards because I blacked out.'

It will be at least two years before Joe can expose his skin to direct sunlight.

His family have thanked medics who battled to save the Year 7 student’s life, as well as members of the public who offered support following the incident.

Upon his release from hospital, Joe was also invited to Swindon Town FC’s County Ground stadium to meet the players, where he was presented with a signed shirt bearing the name 'Lucky' and the number one.

Ms Dean told the BBC: 'When you hear stories of people getting hit by lightning, they don’t survive, and every day I wished I could take the pain and everything away from him.

'But because of what happened and the state that he was in, I was told to think the worst, but he surprised the doctors.'

She also thanked first aiders who rushed to help Joe after he was hit by lightning.

Stuart Arthur, 37, who was standing in
the reception at Dorcan Recreation Centre when the storm hit, arrived 
first on the scene to administer CPR.

Speaking at the time, he said: 'I
heard a horrendous crack and there was a bright white light - I knew 
then that something was wrong.

'I
ran outside and found the young lad face-down and unconscious. Luckily 
the training kicked in and we were able to perform emergency procedures 
on him.

'We assessed whether he was breathing and it was apparent that he was not so I started CPR.

'While
I was performing CPR we got no immediate response but we were not 
really expecting any, you don't tend to get a response straight away.'

Mr Arthur continued CPR while other staff members ushered on cars and comforted Joe's sister, who had witnessed the incident.

His
colleague Stephanie Woodman, 38, who was also in reception when the 
bolt struck, grabbed a defibrillator and rushed to help.

The assistant manager said: 'We heard this amazing sound and just as a lightning bolt struck, it sounded like a big explosion.

'I
didn't know what it was, I just grabbed the emergency kit and went 
running out. It could have been a car crash, an explosion or anything, 
it was so loud.

'Then I just saw him lay on the floor and I began to clean him up and put on the defibrillator.'

Ms Woodman used the defibrillator to monitor Joe's heartbeat but did not use it properly before paramedics arrived to take over.

Paramedics arrived at the scene in six
minutes and managed to revive the youngster before taking him to Great 
Western Hospital in Swindon, where he was treated before being 
transferred to the specialist major trauma centre at Frenchay Hospital, 
in Bristol.
