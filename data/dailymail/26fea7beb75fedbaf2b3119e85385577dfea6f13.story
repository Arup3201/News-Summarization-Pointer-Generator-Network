From flocks of screaming children to mile-long queues, many women dread the annual Christmas shopping trip.

But while the festive shopping spree may be damaging to your purse and feet, it does wonders for your waist line.

New research has revealed that Brits burn 1,572 calories on an average shopping trip - that's nearly a whole day's worth.

Hit the shops: A new study has revealed that the average Brit can burn 1,572 calories on a shopping trip

For the same number of calories you could enjoy three mince pies, a glass of baileys, a slice of chocolate yule log, three Cadbury Milk Tray chocolates and a medium sized portion of Christmas pudding.

The study by Udozi and YouGov also found that the average Brit will walk just under 20 miles doing their Christmas shopping - a similar distance between Clapham, South London and Romford in Essex.

However, despite all the hard work, a recent survey by Forza supplements found that many people take up to four months to lose the weight they put on over the festive season.

The
average person will put on 4lbs between Christmas Eve and New Year’s 
Day after consuming twice their recommended calorie intake.

And the bad news is that it can take until Easter to repair the damage.

It balances out: For the same number of calories you could enjoy three mince pies, a glass of Baileys, a slice of chocolate yule log, three Cadbury Milk Tray chocolates and a medium sized portion of Christmas pudding

Weight gain: More than a third of those surveyed
said it would it would take four months to get back into the same shape
they were in before Christmas

More
than a third of those surveyed (34 per cent) said it would it would 
take four months to get back into the same shape they were in before 
Christmas.

Just under a third of those polled 
said they completely let themselves go on December 25 and had a 
‘complete blow-out’ - with consumption of a staggering 8,530 calories.

That is more than triple a man’s daily 2,500 calorie intake and four times a woman’s 2,000 daily limit.

  3 x mince pies: 531 Kcal

Glass of Baileys: 116 Kcal

Yule log slice: 154 calories

3 Cadbury Milk Tray chocolates: 125 calories

Medium sized portion of Christmas pudding without brandy cream: 550 Kcal
