England fans have arrived in Tallinn ahead of today’s crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia. 

Fans gathered in the Town Hall Square and began draping the area in flags before tonight’s clash at the Le Coq Arena.

Roy Hodgson’s men are currently unbeaten in Group E and will be looking to build on their 5-0 thumping of San Marino during the week.

Hodgson, who revealed his starting line-up to the squad on Saturday, is likely to retain the bulk of the team that has started the first two games of the campaign. 

England have only faced Estonia twice before, during their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, winning both matches 3-0.
