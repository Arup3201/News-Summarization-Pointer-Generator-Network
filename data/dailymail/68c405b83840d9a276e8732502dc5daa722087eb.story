A man is suing New York City for $3 million after he was allegedly severely beaten by a NYPD officer for fare dodging in a subway station.

Donovan Lawson claims he was battered with a nightstick by Officer Evans Mazile on November 20 at Myrtle-Broadway station after trying to follow his girlfriend, Ceanna Pulido-Wolf, through the ticket turnstile.

Video from the station shows Officer Mazile using his nightstick as he attempts to arrest Lawson, who was left with a bloodied head during the confrontation.

The video reveals that bystanders at the station scream and yell for Mazile to stop after Lawson begins to bleed from his head.

Encounter: Officer Evans Mazile was caught on camera using a nightstick and hitting Donovan Lawson's head during the attempt to arrest him. A video of the incident was uploaded to YouTube 

Ilissa Brownstein, the attorney representing both Lawson and Pulido-Wolf, told the New York Daily News she has filed notices of intent to sue New York City for her Lawson and his girlfriend.

Brownstein told The New York Daily News that Lawson now has both headaches and memory loss. 

The newspaper reported that Lawson said yes last week to a deal to dismiss both his fare-beating and resisting arrest charges - provided he stays out of trouble during the next six months.

Brownstein told The New York Daily News that the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office declined to prosecute Pulido-Wolf after she was arrested at the time.

Pulido-Wolf has also announced that she is sue New York City for $1 million on false arrest, the newspaper reported.

Wounded: Lawson was seen with blood all over his face and on his hoodie after he was slammed with the nightstick. An attorney for Mazile has said his client 

The New York Daily News reported that 'Prosecutors are investigating Officer Evans Mazile’s use of force but it remains unclear if the case will be presented to a grand jury.' 

A Brooklyn DA's Office representative declined to comment to MailOnline, citing an ongoing investigation. 

Stuart London, the Patrolman's Benevolent Association attorney representing Mazile, told The New York Daily News his client's wounds from the struggle with Lawson are keeping him from being on the job.

'It’s always disappointing to me when an officer is injured due to an arrest and there’s no communication from the D.A.’s office for the officer’s input as to a disposition of the matter,' London told the newspaper. 

Brownstein and London did not immediately respond to messages from MailOnline seeking comment.
