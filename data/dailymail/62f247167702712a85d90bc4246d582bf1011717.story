A former doctor and his wife have been arrested for allegedly murdering a woman in the home they rented from her in Aspen, Colorado - the tiny ski resort's first killing in 12 years.

William Francis Styler III, 65, was still wearing his bathrobe when he and his tearful wife Nancy, 62, were led away from a motel in handcuffs in nearby Basalt on Monday.

Their alleged victim, Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead in her home on February 26, just four days after she had returned from an extended trip to Australia following trouble with her tenants.

'I'd like to stay in Australia but the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they haven't paid utilities,' Pfister, described as a philanthropist, wrote on Facebook ahead of her return.

Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at a motel on Monday afternoon

Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found

It is not clear if she was referring to the Stylers, who are known to have rented her house from late November or early December. It is not clear when they moved out.

At a news conference following the arrests, Sheriff Joe DiSalvo declined to identify how Pfister was killed and would not say what evidence had led them to arrest the couple.

He added that the investigation is ongoing and that authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of more arrests, the Aspen Times reported.

Nancy Pfister's death is the first known homicide in Pitkin County since October 2001. Her body was found after a 911 call to local authorities, but it is not clear who placed the call.

Loss: Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead four days after she returned from a trip to Australia

Missed: Pfister, pictured with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills

Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said she did not know how anyone could hurt her caring mother

'This case has been hard from the 
beginning on all of us, because of the nature of it,' the sheriff said. 'First-degree murders don’t happen here too often. That’s good. When 
they do, we take it very seriously, and we storm it. We throw everything
 we've got at it.'

Her daughter Juliana Pfister told ABC News that her mother had been a beloved member of the community.

'I have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong people this time.'

Sheriff DiSalvo: 'I loved Nancy - she was a good person.'

'Friendly': Styler is seen left (with a friend) at a party Pfister threw in Nover before she went abroad

Scene: Pfister was found dead in her home, pictured, which she had rented to the Stylers while she traveled

The Aspen Times reported that Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, a prominent local couple who played a major role in the development of the ski resorts. Both preceded their daughter in death.

The Stylers, who are believed to have one adult son, were first questioned by investigators the day after Pfister's body was found and on Monday they were taken to the Pitkin County Jail.

They were held without bond overnight and both face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.

Public records show that Mr Styler is a physician who graduated from the Oklahoma State University College Of Osteopathic Medicine in 1979, but his credentials expired in 2005.
