Civil War solider 1st Lieutenant Alonzo Hersford Cushing will be awarded the Medal of Honor next month, 151 years after his valiant death in the Battle of Gettysburg at the age of 22

More than a century and half after his valiant death in the Battle of Gettysburg, a Civil War soldier will be awarded the Medal of Honor.

The White House announced today that President Obama approved the nation's highest military accolade for 1st Lieutenant Alonzo Hersford Cushing after a hard-fought campaign by his descendants and Civil War historians.

Congress granted a special exemption for Lt Cushing, as the medal usually has to be awarded within three years of the act of heroism.  

Lt Cushing was killed while standing his ground during Pickett's Charge on the third and final day of the battle in July 1863, aged just 22. 

His platoon was defending the Union position against Pickett's Charge, a major Confederate thrust that could have turned the tide in the Civil War. 

Lt Cushing was wounded by a bullet to the head as his small force came under artillery bombardment as nearly 13,000 Confederate infantrymen waited to advance, but he continued to fight despite his grave injuries.

'The Confederate cannon sent volleys over the heads of their advancing troops into the Union lines,' ABC News cited the Waukesha Freeman as saying in 1911.

'Cushing and his neighbors replied with never ceasing spirit, in spite of a constant rain of shot and shell, with horses and men falling all around.

'Cushing was shot several times but kept on firing. He served his last round of canister, was struck in the mouth by a bullet and fell dead.'

Confederate soldiers advanced into the Union fire but eventually retreated with massive losses. The South never recovered from the defeat. 

Lt Cushing was among 51,000 deaths during the fierce battle near the town in Pennsylvania.

President Barack Obama will award Lt Cushing and two Vietnam War veterans in a ceremony in September. Here the President is pictured awarding the medal to Army Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta in 2010

The White House announcement said: 'Refusing to evacuate to the rear despite his severe wounds, he directed the operation of his lone field piece continuing to fire in the face of the enemy.

'With the rebels within 100 yards of his position, Cushing was shot and killed during this heroic stand.

The Medal of Honor is the highest military award for U.S. servicemen.

It has been awarded to 3,450 people in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard since it was introduced in 1863. 

621 of these medals were given out posthumously, including 523 since the outbreak of World War II.

Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta (pictured above) was the first living soldier to receive the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. 

More than 1,500 medals have been given to Civil War soldiers. 124 were handed out to World War I servicemen, 464 to those in WWII, and 16 to soldiers in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Only one woman, Mary Edwards Walker, has been awarded the medal. She was a Union Army surgeon in the Civil War.

19 people have received two Medals of Honor in their lifetime.

Nine Unknown Soldiers have been awarded the medal, including the British Unknown Warrior. 

'His actions made it possible for the Union Army to successfully repulse the Confederate assault.' 

The medal is given to members of the U.S. armed forces who risk their own lives in acts of great personal bravery. 

Lt. Cushing, who was born in Delafield, Wisconsin, and brought up in New York, commanded about 110 men and six cannons during the Battle of Gettysburg.

More than 1,500 soldiers from the Civil War have received the Medal of Honor, but despite a campaign since the 1980s by descendants and admirers of Lt Cushing, he was never chosen for the honor.

The White House also announced that Obama will award the medal to two Vietnam soldiers - Army Command Sergeant Major Bennie G. Adkins and Army Specialist Donald P. Sloat - in a ceremony on September 15. 

Sgt Adkins, who served for 22 years and was deployed to Vietnam three times with the special forces, plans to receive his medal in person.

He is being awarded for actions in combat on his second tour, in 1966, when he ran wounded through enemy fire to drag wounded comrades to safety.

Mr Sloat, from Oklahoma, was killed in action in Vietnam in 1970, aged 20.

He picked up a live grenade triggered by a fellow soldier and used his own body to shield the blast and save his fellow soldiers.

The Battle of Gettysburg, where Lt Cushing died, claimed the lives of 51,000 people over three days
