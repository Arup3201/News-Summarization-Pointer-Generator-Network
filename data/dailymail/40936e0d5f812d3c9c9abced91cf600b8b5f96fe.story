Britain's booming housing market is making it harder for youngsters to get their first home

Young workers will get guaranteed cheap rent to allow them to save a deposit for their first home, under a new government scheme.

The 'rent to buy' programme will offer first-time buyers a 20 per cent discount off their rent for seven years. They will then be given the right to buy the home.

The £400 million plan from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles aims to give young workers a 'springboard' on to the property ladder without having to pay an expensive cash deposit at the start.

The scheme is designed for single people earning £33,000 or less and couples on up to £66,000.

Local housing associations will run the scheme, but ministers will insist that the new one and two bed flats are given to 'hard-working' people who have never owned a home.

The proposal is the first part of a package to address the housing crisis, set to be unveiled at the party conference next week.

It comes amid growing concerns over the length of time it takes to save for a deposit. It now takes an average first-time buyer 22 years to save enough for a deposit without their parents' help.

'The government is standing by people who work hard and do the right thing, and helping them move on and up in life,' Mr Pickles said.

Under Mr Pickles' proposals housing associations will compete for a share of £400 million of cheap government loans to build 10,000 homes over two years between 2015 and 2017.

Landlords of the flats will then be forced to keep their rents low to give young workers the time to build up a deposit so they can buy their place.

Whitehall sources said that the scheme was aimed at 'aspiring professionals' living with parents or friends who were finding it impossible to raise the deposit for a home.

Deposits can cost up to £60,000 for a two-bed property and most young people in their 20s or 30s cannot afford the sum without help from their parents.

Mr Pickles said: 'Both house building and the number of first-time buyers are now at their highest rate since 2007.

'As part of our wider housing programme this new scheme will help increase the provision of low-cost rented accommodation and provide a spring-board for young people to upgrade to home ownership down the line.

'This government is taking action and supporting people who want to get on in life.

'The Labour party plans to do the opposite by introducing rent controls, compulsory registration and blanket local authority licensing which would destroy private and institutional investment in the rented sector, push up rents and reduce choice and supply.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hopes the 'rent to buy' scheme will make it easier for youngsters to save for a deposit

Under the scheme, housing associations will have up to 16 years to pay back the low-cost loans, and until these are repaid the homes have to be available at below market rents.

After seven years, tenants will be able to buy the home for the market price, move out and buy another property or rent an-other home, either privately or with the housing association.

Stuart Ropke, of the National Housing Federation, said: 'We welcome any measure which can help to accelerate the supply of new homes.

'However, we still need more clarity about what the policy aims to achieve. We are concerned most tenants will be unlikely to be able to afford to buy after seven years and we need to consider how we will meet their long-term housing needs.'

Getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.
