Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 in Queensland during a fatal citizen's arrest

A chilling recording of a father-of-three crying for help has been played during a coronial inquest.

Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 during a fatal citizen's arrest in Queensland.

A coroner found yesterday that six people used excessive force which contributed to Mr Kumar's death at a car park in Mooloolaba, north of Brisbane.

He had earlier assaulted two people.

But in a triple zero call recording posted on Sunshine Coast Daily, the 34-year-old's urgent pleas  can be heard.

'Oh my brother, I can't breathe,' he said. But a male voice responds: 'Not our problem bud.' 

Brisbane Coroner John Hutton delivered his findings on Wednesday, saying that those restraining Mr Kumar had failed to release pressure on him despite his appeal.

'I find that their failure to release pressure on Mr Kumar, despite Mr Kumar's continual pleading with them that he could not breathe, fell well-short of any standard of reasonableness,' he said.

'The force they used to continue to restrain Mr Kumar in the circumstances was excessive.'

The triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on September 13, 2012 was played at the coronial inquest.

The triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on September 13, 2012 was played at the coronial inquest.

The following can be heard:

A male voice: 'You're not going nowhere pal';

Mr Amit Kumar: 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe';

A male voice: 'Not our problem bud';

Ms Jodie Cassar: Where do you get off hitting women huh?';

A male voice: 'You f***ing piece of sH**';

Ms Cassar: 'It's because you know I can't fight ya, that's why'; and

A male voice: 'Are they on the line?'. 

The following can be heard:

A male voice: 'You're not going nowhere pal';

Mr Kumar: 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe';

A male voice: 'Not our problem bud'. 

Last month's inquest heard the self-employed truck driver assaulted two staff - including Jodie Cassar - from a fishing charter boat when he was told he couldn't join the trip because he had booked it under a false name of 'Adam Jones'.

Staff and customers from the fishing charter - five men and one woman - used zip ties to restrain Mr Kumar.

The coroner found he died from the combined effects of restraint, heart disease and excess weight around his stomach.

A pathologist concluded that contributing factors were the position in which Mr Kumar was held, pressure on his head and neck blocking his airway, and the stress associated with his struggle.

Mr Hutton said the initial decision to restrain Mr Kumar was reasonable, but the group failed to recognise the danger to his life.

He singled out a doctor among the six people who, the coroner said, acted unreasonably by not taking more control over Mr Kumar's well-being.

However, the coroner did not recommend anyone be prosecuted.

'I find that the actions of the people who restrained Mr Kumar contributed to his death,' he said.

'However, I am unable to quantify the level of contribution their actions had to Mr Kumar's death.'

Mr Hutton did recommend that first-aid training providers consider raising awareness about the dangers of positional and restraint asphyxia.
