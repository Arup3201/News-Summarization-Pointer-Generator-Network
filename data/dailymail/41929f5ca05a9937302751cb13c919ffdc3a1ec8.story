He's known as something of an emotional man after shedding a tear when he became Speaker of the House last year.

But it seems John Boehner is making a habit of showing his sensitive side after once again weeping at an event to honour astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.

The House Speaker had given a speech praising the work of the Moon landing astronauts and became tearful after stepping from the podium at Washington's Capitol Hill.

Cry me to the moon: Normally the recipients of medals are the ones who let the occasion get the better of them, but in Washington Mr Boehner gave out the awards before bursting into tears

The three astronauts were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, which was approved in July 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.

Boehner told the assembled crowd at the medal ceremony: 'Neil Armstrong was once asked: Why did you, this one man, choose to speak for all when you set foot on the lunar surface? As it turns out, there was no script, there were no notes.

'When the moment came, Neil's thoughts turned to the 400,000 people who worked on the project.... He said he knew 'it would be a big something for all those folks and a lot of others who weren't even involved in the project.' So it was.'

It was after this speech and having given out the medals that Boehner started crying, to the surprise of onlookers.

One attendee at the ceremony told the Huffington Post: 'It was certainly a moving event, but seeing him sob and gasp for air was sort of off-putting.'

Emotional: The outburst of feelings is not the first time Me Boehner broke down at a public event as, pictured here, he was tearful when he became Speaker of the House in November 2010.

Mr Boehner's spokesperson Brendan Buck said the speaker only cried because he was so moved at the chance to share and stage with and honour the Moon landing heroes.

Mr Buck said: 'Like the speaker said, honoring these American heroes was a pretty cool opportunity.

After winning control of the House last November, Mr Boehner was seen to break down, having told how he had 'lived the American dream.'

And earlier the same year he was left in tears after accepting the gavel from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi in January 2010.

Speaking to Fox News, Mr Boehner last year defended his habit of showing his emotions in public.

He said: 'I'm not going to apologize for being emotionally attached to the things I feel most strongly about.

'I wear my emotions on my sleeve.'
