A teenager who was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer three years ago believed a good Samaritan was donating the funds needed to save his life - only to discover he was the victim of a hoax.

After a plea by family friend and The Deadliest Catch star Johnathan Hillstrand, a woman came forward offering to give $250,000 to the family of Thomas Doty, of Maple Valley, Washington, to pay for his osteosarcosis treatment.

But despite emails, phone calls and a number of assurances, the money never came and Thomas' mother Tiffany believes the offer was made by an obsessive fan, just so she could get close to Hillstrand.

The Dotys have gone bankrupt covering the medical bills for their 19-year-old son's surgery as well as chemo and radiotherapy.

After the public appeal and the generous offer from the woman - who called herself Jonnica Ellis - the family stopped accepting money from other sources because they did not want to take more than they needed.

Now Ellis has mysteriously vanished after stringing the family along for weeks, she told Fox News.

'Within a day of Johnathan coming out here, I received an email from a woman who said, "I am filled with compassion for your story, I cannot believe what you've gone through... and I just want you to know that within seven to ten days you're going to receive a check".'

Over the next few days, Ellis also sent flowers to Thomas and a copy of a bank statement saying a cashier’s check in the amount of $250,000 had been processed.

When the money didn't show up, the family tried to contact her but her phone and email address were cancelled.

In the mean time however, the woman continued to contact Hillstrand to try and start a relationship with him under the guise she had helped save Thomas' life.

'I think she is somebody who is an obsessed fan, if you want to call her that. We have lost the last five weeks of his life with somebody who chose to play games with his life. And he doesn't have time for that anymore.'
