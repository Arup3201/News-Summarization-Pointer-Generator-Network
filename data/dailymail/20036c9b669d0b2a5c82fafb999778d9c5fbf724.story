A Texas nurse accused of shooting dead a young mother and abducting her newborn son last year avoided a possible death sentence by pleading guilty Tuesday and accepting a sentence of life without parole.

Verna McClain, 32, was awaiting trial on a capital murder charge for fatally shooting the new mother outside a pediatric clinic in the Houston suburb of Spring and snatching her 3-day-old son.

Montgomery County prosecutors had said they would seek the death penalty against McClain for the April 2012 slaying of 28-year-old Kala Golden-Schuchardt.

Plea deal: Verna McClain, pictured in April 
2012, pleaded guilty to murdering a new mother and abducting her 
3-day-old son last year, and accepted a life sentence

Woman of few words: McClain appeared Tuesday before State District Judge Kelly Case, providing one word 'yes' and 'no' answers

The infant was found hours later safe 
with McClain's sister, who told authorities McClain, a mother of three, 
intended to adopt the child.

Investigators
and McClain's relatives said she had a miscarriage and was obsessed 
with the idea to find a baby to pass off as her own.

Montgomery
County District Attorney Brett Ligon said he had promised 
Golden-Schuchardt's family that McClain would die in prison either by 
lethal injection or by never being free again.

Tuesday's plea agreement provided finality and meant the family no longer would have to come to court, he said.

‘The
victim's family got to hear what few in their place do, an admission of
guilt,’ Ligon added. ‘No games were played. No hiding behind insanity 
defenses,’ the Houston Chronicle reported.

Obsessed: McClain's relatives said the woman, pictured last April, had suffered a miscarriage and was fixated on finding another baby to pass off as her own

Victims: Kala Schuchardt (pictured left with her
husband Keith) was shot as she left a clinic where she had taken her 
son Keegan (right) for a check up. McClain then allegedly stole the baby
and sped off

The prosecutor described the outcome of the case as ‘the right verdict for the family.’

Golden-Schuchardt's
mother, Linda Golden, said she was pleased McClain never would get out 
of prison but added, ‘I'll never be over the pain of losing my 
daughter.’

McClain appeared 
Tuesday before State District Judge Kelly Case dressed in a pink and 
white striped jail suit. She said little, providing one word ‘yes’ and 
‘no’ answers in response to the judge's questions.

One of her attorneys, Tyrone Moncriffe, said McClain is remorseful.

‘It was a tragedy,’ he said. ‘She just feels sorry for the family.’

Authorities
said McClain was waiting outside a pediatrician's office north of 
Houston. Witnesses said she repeatedly shot Golden-Schuchardt, then 
grabbed the child from her truck and drove away.

According
to witnesses, the dying woman leaned into the vehicle and tried to take
back her son, Keegan, screaming, ‘My baby!’ but McClain sped off.

Crime scene: Schuchardt's shoes and bag at the site where she was shot and left screaming, 'My baby!'

Search: An hour after the shooting, police stormed a nearby apartment block after the suspect's car was seen outside. McClain told officers where they could find the unharmed baby boy

Later in the day, two detectives spotted a vehicle outside a nearby apartment complex that matched witnesses' descriptions.

McClain
later showed up at the apartment, and in their conversation, detectives
learned of McClain's sister and where the child could be.

The abducted child was returned to his father.

Prosecutors said McClain, who has three children, had been pregnant with her fiancé’s child. She had been planning to marry in May 2012.

But after she suffered an alleged miscarriage she decided to find another child and convince her fiancé it was his, they said.

McClain's sister also told authorities she had told her she was planning to adopt. She added that once 
McClain had snatched Keegan, she said she had the baby and needed 'to do
the adoption'.

Investigators believe McClain staked out the Northwoods Pediatric Center - where she had taken her own children in the past – looking for a woman with a baby she could kidnap.

On April 17, 2012, Golden walked to her pick-up truck after a check-up with Keegan 
around 2pm, when McClain, who was in a 2007 Lexus parked in the adjacent spot, 
starting fighting with her, police said.

'Killer': Prosecutors said McClain, pictured left and right, had suffered a miscarriage and told her sister, centre, that she was going to adopt a baby. After she snatched Keegan, she told her sister she had the child

Fiance: But McClain told Kevin Carter (pictured), who she was due to marry in May, that she had given birth

After shooting the young mother at
close range, McClain placed the baby in her car and sped off,
hitting Kala as she shrieked, 'My baby!' from the ground. She died 
shortly after.

Deputies stormed an apartment block less
than a mile away after the getaway car was seen parked outside. McClain
approached officers and admitted to the killing and kidnapping, police 
said.

McClain told detectives she had taken the boy to a home in northwest 
Harris County. He was found there unharmed six hours after his mother 
had died.

A reporter from KHOU TV was allowed to witness the meeting between McClain and her fiancé Kevin Carter and ask her questions.

Reporter Rucks Russell reported McClain had a 30 minute visit at Montgomery County Jail with her fiancé and activist Quanell X.

Mourning: Kala, right, was remembered at her funeral last week. Pictured left, Wilson 'Donnie' Golden sits as a family member comforts her husband Keith Schuchardt and her mother Linda Golden

Service: The family is escorted to the funeral in Willis, Texas. Kala also left behind an older child

Russell said McClain apologised to her fiancé for the trouble she had caused, but Kevin Carter said he still planned to marry her.

The baby's father Keith Schuchardt told KHOU after the slaying: '[Kala] was sweet, lovable. I loved her, and she loved me. Everything was going fine until today.'

When asked by reporters what he would tell his wife now, Schuchardt, who had been married to Golden for three years, said: 'I wish you were here with me to get me through this.'
