Manchester United are seeking confirmation from Porto over Danilo's proposed switch to Real Madrid.

Louis van Gaal is in the market for a new right back this summer, with the 23-year-old Brazilian a primary target.

But Sportsmail understands Danilo has agreed to join Real Madrid ahead of next season, despite manager Carlo Ancelotti insisting a deal has not been completed.

And United have contacted Porto chiefs for definitive confirmation over the Brazil international's mooted switch to Spain.

Van Gaal remains a big admirer of Danilo and is reluctant to end his interest in the defender.

But United do not want to waste their time in pursuing Danilo if a move to Real has already been rubber-stamped.

Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne and Barcelona's Dani Alves are also on United's radar.

And the Old Trafford club will look to press ahead with moves for Clyne or Alves should they hear Danilo's move to the Spanish capital is agreed.
