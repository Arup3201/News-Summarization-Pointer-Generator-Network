Nearly 70 years after the end of the Second World War, the name of Bletchley Park is etched in the nation's consciousness.

For many it is synonymous with spying, code-breaking, intelligence and subterfuge, the place where Britain's best brains were pushed to the limit of their capabilities to undermine the relentless German war machine.

Yet Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, was just one of countless stately homes across Britain without which the nation's ability to counter the Nazi threat would have been so much the weaker.

As conflict became inevitable and all attempts at appeasement failed, country houses such as Bletchley were commandeered in their thousands for the war effort and transformed into hospitals, schools, barracks, listening and monitoring centres, military command headquarters and stores for national art treasures - even, in one case, accommodation for displaced royalty.

Badminton House, in Gloucestershire, became the wartime home of the country's most distinguished evacuee, Queen Mary, mother of the reigning monarch, King George VI.

Its owners, the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort, were allocated two bedrooms and a sitting room while the royal visitor, who arrived in true diva style in September 1939 with 50 staff and more than 70 pieces of luggage, had the run of the rest of the house.

Hitherto an entirely urban dweller, Queen Mary grew to love the rural life, once remarking to her niece during a stroll in the countryside, 'Is that what hay looks like? I never knew.'

Keeping up standards became part of Her Majesty's self-imposed war work. A fellow inhabitant of Badminton describes an emergency visit to the great house's underground air raid shelter.

'There I was in the middle of the night with my hair all anyhow and in a filthy old dressing gown; and there in the shelter sat Queen Mary, perfectly dressed with her pearls, doing a crossword puzzle. I never did that again.'

From a potentially uneasy mix of military and civilian personnel, aristocrats and London evacuees, lifelong bonds and friendships were formed.

Longleat, the seat of the Marquess of Bath in Wiltshire, became a refuge for the girls from the Royal School in Bath, and the octogenarian aristocrat delighted in attending concerts given by them as well as pottering around the grounds with his young visitors in the company of his ancient dog.

The girls, in turn, became fond of their venerable host, according to a diary kept by Rosemary Ellis, the art mistress. When Lord Bath died just after the war the girls paid their respects, forming a guard of honour on the front steps when his coffin left the house.

The deaf and elderly Lord Newton at Lyme Park, in Cheshire, was equally delighted to share his vast ancestral home with 40 evacuee children from Manchester. As a change from his habitual rather solitary existence, he spent much of the war sitting by a roaring log fire with an assortment of his guests, a 'lot of dogs', according to reports, and his drinks table.

Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, the birthplace and ancestral home of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, also played host to a school – in this case the displaced pupils of Malvern College in Worcestershire.

But their stay was a brief one. In the autumn of 1940 Blenheim was taken over by MI5, which moved there from another temporary home, Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London.

The state rooms were divided up into offices for the national security service and filled with filing cabinets and trestle tables.

Nissen huts and Army trucks took over the magnificent forecourt. Although supposedly top secret, the identity of the palace's new occupants soon became common knowledge, the conductors on local buses habitually calling out 'Anyone for MI5?' when they reached Blenheim's gates.

Hatfield House, in Hertfordshire, became a military hospital where badly injured soldiers were sent to recover in mind and body, with the lovely architecture and gardens providing part of the cure.

Pictures from the time show nurses and patients getting lost together in the estate's magnificent maze. Margaret, Countess of Lichfield, whose home, Heath House in Staffordshire, fulfilled a similar function, wrote, 'The patients had the free run of the place and loved and respected it. It seemed to bring the best out in them - they came out of hell and found themselves in heaven.'

Rufford Abbey, in Nottinghamshire, was one of several stately homes in the Midlands used as prisoner-of-war camps, the location being around 60 miles from the coast and thus thought to be off-putting to potential absconders.

Not that Rufford's occupants showed much interest in escaping, if local memories are to be believed. Most of them were Italian soldiers who spent their time falling in love with the local girls, stripping the silk damask from the walls of the historic mansion to make gifts and keepsakes for their sweethearts.

Penrhyn Castle in Caernarvonshire was chosen to house the treasures of the National Gallery, largely because its stable doors were tall enough to admit Van Dyck's equestrian portrait of Charles I.

But even then the priceless artworks were not immune from risk. In a letter to his boss in London, assistant keeper Martin Davies wrote, 'For your most secret ear, one of our troubles at Penrhyn Castle is that the owner is celebrating the war by being fairly constantly drunk. He stumbled with a dog into the dining room (where many of the paintings were being restored) a few days ago; this will not happen again.'

Longleat House, became a refuge for the girls from the Royal School in Bath

Once described as one of the most important artistic properties in England, Wilton House, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, had been used as a military hospital during the First World War before becoming a magnet for painters, writers and socialites during the 20s and 30s.

These included Cecil Beaton, who was on hand at the beginning of the Second World War to photograph some of the 40 nursery school children who arrived in 1939 during the first wave of evacuations from the capital, as they played on the cedar-shaded lawns.

Wilton's war was not, however, a happy one. In June 1940 the nursery children were moved on and the house was requisitioned as the Army's Southern Command headquarters.

It was in one of Wilton's reception rooms that the D-day landings were planned - the paintings by Rembrandt, Tintoretto, Breughel, Rubens and Joshua Reynolds that had lined its walls having been stacked away in the mansion's cellars. But as in so many requisitioned properties, the military invasion took a toll.

As a result of the traffic of soldiers' feet, its magnificent Gothic staircase gave way with an almighty crash early one morning in June 1941.

Such dramas were repeated all over the country. Staircases were chopped up for firewood; paintings and panelling used as dart boards; jeeps and armoured vehicles driven into lakes and up staircases; gardens concreted over; statues beheaded and conservatories machine-gunned.

Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, which was housing a battalion, also had its gardens and park torn up and compulsorily open-cast mined for coal, causing horrendous structural damage.

In an extravagant good-riddance gesture to the wartime years, departing troops at Egginton Hall in Derbyshire left all the taps on, bringing the ceilings down, rotting the woodwork and forcing its demolition. In West Sussex, Arundel Castle's herd of red deer was shot and eaten.

Perhaps unfairly, the Canadian soldiers stationed in the south of England took the blame for much of the damage – perhaps it was easier for locals to blame foreign troops rather than their own. The major portion of beautiful Georgian Shillinglee Park, also in West Sussex, was gutted by Canadian troops during a party in 1943.

At Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire soldiers carved their names, addresses and numbers in the balustrade of the elegant bridge in the park.

And yet despite the dreadful loss of 
such a significant swathe of Britain's heritage, the majority of houses 
were restored and survived

Even without vandalism, fire was a hazard at a time when virtually everybody smoked. Dozens of country houses were burned to the ground, others were left in such poor condition in 1945 that they seemed beyond restoration.

Without proper maintenance, pipes burst, ceilings collapsed and dry rot rampaged. A staggering 1,000 country houses were demolished in the decade between 1945 and 1955 as a result of wartime mistreatment - the destruction has been compared to the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.

And yet despite the dreadful loss of such a significant swathe of Britain's heritage, the majority of houses were restored and survived. Beginning with Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, Longleat and Arundel in 1947, an increasing number threw open their doors to the public. Not only did this make them eligible for repair grants, but it also gave them a vital means of upkeep too.

Nearly all the larger houses that took this step survived and flourished. Two or three generations on, they have been fully refurbished and brought back to life, and it is now hard to recall the state they were in following the end of hostilities. Others, such as Chicksands Priory in Bedfordshire and Southwick in Hampshire, remained in military use.

As for Bletchley Park, the outbreak of war in 1939 saw an unexpected reversal in its fortunes. It had been scheduled for demolition in the late 30s to make way for a new suburb as part of what is now Milton Keynes.

But so great was its fame following its requisitioning that its longtime survival, now as a museum, was ensured. A grateful nation took it to their hearts, and there it has remained. Like so many of Britain's other stately homes - even those with histories going back centuries - the war years really were its finest hour.
