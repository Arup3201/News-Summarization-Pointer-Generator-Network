A British cricket player who killed a fan outside a Spanish bar by slashing his throat with a broken bottle has been jailed for six years.

Thomas Swannell, 46, was sentenced by a court on the island of Majorca on Wednesday for the brutal slaying of Gary Vigors, 41, in the resort of Magaluf in March 2011.

Swannell was also ordered to pay Vigors' now four-year-old daughter £122,000 in compensation - and his father £14,000.

The court heard how Vigors died in front of family and friends after being set upon by the deranged Swannell at around 2.30am on March 26, 2011.

The pair had reportedly traded insults earlier in the evening.

On seeing each other again at the Cafe Plaza, Swannell grabbed a glass bottle, smashed it and rammed the jagged end into Vigors' throat.

Swannell also cut him on his head and face as the pair fell to the ground - continuing his assault by kicking him in the stomach and arms.

They were then separated and Swannell left the pub.

Vigors, bleeding heavily, stumbled outside. But, once in the street, he was attacked again and pushed to the floor.

Paramedics arrived on the scene but were unable to save him from bleeding to death.

Swannell ran off but was later arrested by Spanish police.

Previous reports suggested both men were among a group of 58 players and supporters who belonged to the Finedon Dolben village cricket club from Northamptonshire who made the trip over to the holiday island.

Swannell, from Northampton, was a player with the club which was in Spain to play a touring match against a local side.

Vigors, from Chelmsford, Essex, was one of the supporters who had travelled to cheer on the team.
