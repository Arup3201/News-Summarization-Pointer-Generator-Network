Twitter has refused to take action over pornographic images posted on its site despite fears that children are being exposed to them.

Half a million explicit pictures are published on the site every day – with pornographers now ‘cynically’ using the social network to target the young.

But because the website is not classified as pornographic, the pictures can be seen even in households with child internet filters in place, campaigners say.

Half a million explicit pictures are published on Twitter every day – with pornographers ‘cynically’ using it to target the young. MPs say Twitter bosses have resisted calls to block or filter illicit content on the website

MPs say Twitter bosses have resisted calls to block or filter illicit content on the website.

A senior MP told the Mail Twitter bosses had snubbed a meeting with Government ministers on how to tackle internet porn. 

They failed to send anyone to the high-level meeting, instead offering to have a member of staff from Dublin ‘phone in’.

Other major internet companies – including Facebook and Google – agreed to attend the summit chaired by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey.

Labour MP Helen Goodman, a former shadow culture minister, last night said Twitter was failing to take the ‘cynical’ targeting of children by pornographers on Twitter seriously.

‘Neither Twitter nor Tumblr could be bothered to send anybody to a meeting with a government minister,’ she said. 

‘I think [online porn] is a really serious problem but I don’t think they take it seriously.’

And she said there was a clear problem with pornographers taking advantage of the fact the site was able to sidestep internet controls.

Because Twitter is not classified as pornographic the pictures can be seen even in households with child internet filters in place - critics say lax controls mean the site is saturated with pornographic images

An investigation earlier this week into the issue revealed that as many as 500,000 sexual images are posted on Twitter daily, including images of hardcore and extreme sexual practices. 

Remarkably, it is believed there are now more pictures of porn on Twitter than there are of pets.

But unlike other websites, such as Facebook and YouTube, the company does not have a policy of blocking such images.

Twitter is being increasingly exploited by pornographers to publicise their explicit material.

The social network is not restricted by family-friendly internet filters as these only block specific web addresses, rather than a website’s content.

As Twitter is not blocked by filters, there is no control on the images published on it.

This means people can publish graphic images, including videos of hardcore sex acts, on their Twitter ‘feeds’ without being blocked.

The graphic images are used as a way of luring internet surfers to spend money on their services, for example by buying more explicit pictures or by paying to watch explicit videos.

And although Twitter says it has a minimum age limit of 13, it does not ask people to verify their age when they set up an account.

The pornographic Twitter accounts are often labelled ’18 +’ but the social network does not have any mechanism in place to check users’ ages.

In fact, the ’18 +’ label can be used to help people – including curious young people – to search for pornographic material. 

Nor does it actively monitor explicit content on its website, stating only that users who publish ‘sensitive’ material should mark it as such, so that other people on the social network are warned before they click to view the material. 

Users are also able to label graphic images as ‘sensitive’, at which point it will be sent to Twitter’s team to review.

And although the social network removes profile photographs or background images that contain pornographic content, it does not do anything to remove any of the explicit images published in Twitter ‘feeds’. 

Anyone who ‘follows’ or searches a porn actor on Twitter can gain easy access to graphic images and videos.

Critics say these lax controls have meant the site is becoming saturated with pornographic images.

Campaigners last night accused the company of ‘cynical’, ‘exploitative’ behaviour, and said it was ‘taking the coward’s way out’ by failing to crack down on the issue.

John Carr, of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, said: ‘We know that exposure to porn has damaging effects on many young children, and yet it is freely available on Twitter. 

'Twitter has got a huge responsibility and it’s failing to live up to it.’

Twitter has 15 million users in the UK, of which one million are thought to be child accounts.

The Daily Mail has been highlighting the dangers of the easy access to adult images online as part of its Block Online Porn campaign.

David Cameron persuaded the large internet providers to make it much easier for parents to impose a filter to stop their children stumbling across such material.

When a family sets up a device, the option of choosing a filter is ‘on’ – meaning parents have to specifically ‘de-click’ if they do not want it to be installed.
