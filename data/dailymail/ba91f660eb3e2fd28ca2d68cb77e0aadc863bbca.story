A Birmingham school at the heart of an alleged Islamist plot to take over state institutions allowed students to express 'positive views' about terrorism, it has been claimed.

Park View School in Alum Rock, which is under investigation over the 'Trojan Horse' plot, allegedly failed to challenge children's opinions about the 7/7 and 9/11 atrocities due to 'cultural sensitivity'.

It also reportedly advised staff not to bring soldiers into the school for visits, while one employee allegedly spoke of wanting an 'Islamic state', according to the British Humanist Association.

Allegations: Park View School in Alum Rock allegedly allowed students to speak 'positively' about terrorism

Assembly: The school reportedly failed to challenge some children's opinions about the 7/7 and 9/11 atrocities because of 'cultural sensitivity'. Above, an assembly to prepare pupils for Ramadan is held at Park View School

The allegations were made by 'several' of the maths and science academy's former employees, who have only recently chosen to make them public, said the Association.

Other claims against the school include:

Humanist: Pavan Dhaliwal, the British Humanist Association's Head of Public Affairs, said it is 'vital' that all state schools 'foster an environment inclusive of every child' regardless of religion

The Association, a charity promoting a secular state and equal treatment regardless of religion, said some of the allegations dated back to 2011.

However, the whistleblower who made contact at the time decided not to press for action, it said.

Former Park View employees subsequently contacted the charity in January this year - resulting in contact with the original complainant.

The Association said the findings of its own investigation into the school's RE 
teachings were passed to the Department for Education and Ofsted on 
January 31.

Park View Education Trust, which runs the school in Alum Rock, has defended the institution, saying its curriculum 'makes clear that the basis of all sexual relationships is informed consent'.

It added that claims that male pupils were informed via a worksheet that wives had to give sex to their husbands were 'categorically untrue', while the school has not yet received any complaints in relation to the Creationism acccusations.

Inquiry: On Wednesday, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot were revealed in a list by Birmingham City Council. Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook

Under investigation: The allegations came to light earlier this year. Above, Adderley Primary School in Saltley

The trust has not yet commented specifically on allegations that it failed to challenge some children's opinions about terrorism.

Pavan
 Dhaliwal, the Association's Head of Public Affairs, said: 'It is vital 
that all our state schools teach a broad and balanced curriculum, 
actively contribute to community cohesion and foster an environment 
inclusive of every child, parent and member of staff, regardless of 
their religious or non-religious beliefs.'

Three
 separate investigations are currently under way over claims that hardline Islamists are seizing control of government bodies, segregating male and female pupils and banning sex education.

One school is even being investigated over 
allegations that the al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, 
who died in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, was praised in 
assembly.

The inquiries are being carried out by Ofsted, the Government and Birmingham City Council.

On Wednesday, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the allegedly plot were revealed in a list by the city council.

As well as Park View, they include Gracelands Nursery school in Sparkbrook and Golden Hillock School in Sparkhill.

Request: Three separate inquiries are currently under way into the 'Trojan Horse' plot. Ofsted inspections are being carried out at the direct request of Education Secretary Michael Gove

They also feature Adderley Primary School, Highfield Junior and Infant School, Nansen Primary, Alston Primary School and Saltley School and Specialist Science College, all in Saltley, Birmingham.

Earlier this week, Sir Albert Bore, council leader, said Ofsted was not intending to publish its final inspection reports until 'the first or second week of May'.

He added that he has not yet seen the draft version of the inspection reports, which have been carried out at the request of Education Secretary Michael Gove.

The
 councilâ€™s investigation is being headed by former headteacher Ian 
Kershaw, who is sifting through about 200 concerns raised since the 
alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot emerged.

Park View Education Trust said in a statement: 'Park View Academy has a clear curriculum policy which governs the teaching of all subjects within the school.

'Our
 sex and relationships education (SRE) is taught in single sex groups 
and makes clear that the basis of all sexual relationships is informed 
consent.

'After
 a lesson that took place around 2011 it became clear to the school that
 boys had misunderstood a historical reference to do with cultural 
expectations of sex within marriage.

'As soon as the school became aware that this was the case it took immediate action and held a special assembly for Year 10 boys to make it clear that sex without informed consent is rape.

'The allegation that boys were informed via a worksheet that wives have to give sex to their husbands is categorically untrue. The
 teaching of Creationism in Science is not school policy.

'Without 
having received any complaints in relation to the allegation that 
Creationism has been taught it is very difficult for us to comment 
further.

'Had we received a complaint we would of course have investigated it fully.'

MailOnline has attempted to contact the school regarding allegations that it allowed students to express 'positive views' about terrorism.
