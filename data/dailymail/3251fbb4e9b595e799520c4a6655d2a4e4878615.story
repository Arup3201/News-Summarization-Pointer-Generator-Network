Motocross master, Robbie 'Maddo' Maddison, is known for his iconic, record-breaking jumps at famous locations around the globe.

His previous death-defying stunts include back flipping the Tower Bridge in London, jumping onto and then off of the Arc de Triomphe at Paris Las Vegas and launching across the Corinth Canal in Greece.

And to celebrate the upcoming release of a full-length documentary, On Any Sunday, The Next Chapter, which chronicles the international sport of motorcycle racing, Maddison is taking on his most mind blowing jump yet. 

Professional motocross rider, Robbie Maddison, takes on a death-defying jump - complete with 185 foot drop

In this preview for the film, Maddison undertakes a positively shocking stunt: a motocross jump that includes a 145 foot vertical drop at Park City's Olympic Ski Jump.

He also breaks the Olympic bobsled record, going up the track, while working his way up the mountain to launch off.

But performing such a death-defying stunt is in no way an impromptu decision. 

In fact, was in 2011 that Robbie first got the idea.

In honour of upcoming full-length documentary about motorcycle racing, Maddison jumped off of Park City's Olympic Ski Jump

Travelling 71 mph, Maddison launched himself 114 metres into the air for a jump that included a 185 foot drop

On his first day in Skullcandy's Park City headquarters, Robbie looked out of the conference room window and spotted the K120 Nordic Ski jump across the street at the Utah Olympic Park, stating right there and then that he would jump it one day.

Two years later, he's brought his dream to life. 

When the thriller seeker's not leaping over everything from football fields to the San Diego Harbor, he stays busy winning X Games medals and X-Fighters moto trophies.

He can also be seen in Red Bull Media House's upcoming documentary film, in theatres on November 7.
