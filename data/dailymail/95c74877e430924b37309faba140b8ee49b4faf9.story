Three more syringes have been found hidden inside clothing at a Walmart store, raising the total to seven and prompting fears for customer safety.

A mother last week claimed her daughter was pierced by a syringe as she put on a new pair of pyjamas from the store in Georgia, Atlanta.

Now, in addition to three other incidents reported last month, two shoppers and a staff member have found needles in different pairs of trousers.

Police are asking anyone who bought clothing at the store to thoroughly inspect it. Nobody was injured by the latest three syringes found.

‘I've been here 19 years and I've never witnessed anything quite like this,’ the store manager, who only gave the name Billy, told WSBTV.

A shopper told police on Monday he found a needle in a pair of trousers at the weekend, after he bought them on Black Friday last month.

Then a female shopper also reported finding a syringe - and an assistant manager spotted another syringe in another pair of trousers.

‘I heard about it last week but I didn't know it happened again,’ customer Abeed Bawa told WSBTV. ‘Something really needs to be done.’

Walmart has done its own searches and found syringes but no suspects 
have yet been identified.

A woman pricked when she reached inside a boxed bra to ensure it was the right size was identified by local news sources as Patricia Headrick.

‘It's a waiting game right now,’ Mrs Headrick told WXIA. ‘I'm scared to death,' she said, adding that she is worried she could have contracted HIV.

‘I don't know what's going to happen. I'm shocked that someone can do this to someone. It's mean. I don't understand why someone would do this.’

The syringes were sent to investigators for further tests. Mrs Headrick has gone for tests but will have to return for more in six months.

She paid $1,300 for medicine to avoid an illness and took antiviral medicine. Walmart has now said it will cover her expenses.

A syringe was also found in a pair of Hello Kitty socks and a pair of trousers - but neither of those incidents resulted in any injuries.

A Walmart spokesman told the Rome News-Tribune that the company is looking at CCTV footage and employees are being extra vigilant.
