David Warner honoured the memory of Phillip Hughes by blasting an emotionally charged century - the best, he said, of his career - on day one of the rearranged first Test against India. 

A cloud hung over the Adelaide Oval though when captain Michael Clarke was forced to leave the field with a back problem when he was 60 not out, and, like Hughes on that fateful day, looking good for a century of his own.

Warner’s hundred was the perfect tribute to Hughes on a day that started with 63 seconds of applause for the 25-year-old, who died after being hit on the head by bouncer when he was 63 not out playing domestic cricket two weeks ago. Warner was fielding at gully on that day and rushed to Hughes’ aid when he fell and sat with his friend on the buggy that took him from a cricket field for the very last time.

Around 20,000 spectators were in attendance for the first day's play of the first Test of the Australian summer on Tuesday

This was no ordinary opening day of a Test match. The Adelaide Oval stood as one, on a Tuesday, to pay their respects to Hughes before the start of play. Players, management and match officials lined up in front of a large white 408 – Hughes Baggy Green number - painted onto the pristine outfield while a video tribute was played out on the big screen. Players wore black armbands, sported 408 on the chests of their playing shirts, and stood shoulder to shoulder to honour their mate.

If Warner had been moved by the tribute, he dealt with the emotion through his bat. Boundary after boundary was unleashed in an exhilarating first hour, as he punishing Varun Aaron in particular. With every one of Warner’s fours, there was a sense of relief and release from the crowd as they applauded fervently. Their energy surely translated to the opener, whose innings was punctuated with poignant milestones.

First there was the half century, reached off just 45 balls. When his ninth four whistled to the boundary he raised his bat gently, closed his eyes and tilted his head back to the heavens. Then, on 61, he swept to deep square leg, ran two, and as he reached 63 not out, the crowd rose once again in spontaneous applause. Warner threw his head up to the skies for a second time, raised his bat and momentarily sank to his haunches.

He was already removing his helmet as he jogged the single that took him to three figures midway through the afternoon session. He kissed the badge on his helmet with feeling, raised his bat and helmet to the skies, looked long towards the heavens, and after two weeks of tension and grief he finally leapt into the air and was engulfed in a bear hug by his batting partner Clarke. As Warner buried his head in his captain’s chest, you could have been forgiven for thinking the left-hander's shoulders shook just a little.

It was his 10th Test century but the most meaningful and highly charged of them all. He eventually departed to yet another ovation when he tried to hoik India’s debutant leg spinner Karn Sharma into the Chappell stand and was caught at deep midwicket.

Clarke had received a stirring reception when he came out to bat after Watson was caught at second slip for 14 – the second wicket of the day after Chris Rogers edged an attempted cover drive to the cordon. 

Before Watson had left the outfield the members were already on their feet, turning their backs to the field of play and looking up towards the dressing room, waiting for the Australia captain to come jogging down the steps.

Sharma then welcomed Shane Watson to the crease by bowling him a bouncer with his very first delivery

Clarke cut a desperately sad figure though, limping back to the dressing room 60 runs later, with his back crocked again, having put a on century stand with Warner. He grimaced after withdrawing from a pull shot, and tried to stretch his back on the outfield, receiving treatment on the ground, before eventually leaving to be further assessed. Until that point he had been batting fluently and moving freely. He was just three runs short of 63.

Questions will linger as to whether Clarke was genuinely fit enough to play this match, or whether the personal enormity of the occasion encouraged him to take a risk. Regardless of the hamstring, which has troubled him in the build up, his back has been an ongoing issue and there must be some doubt as to the role he will be able to play through the rest of the Australian summer.

The first bouncer of the match came 20 minutes into the day's play. It was bowled by Aaron and was roundly applauded by the crowd as Warner ducked safely beneath it. The next delivery was short, too, but played less safely as Warner upper cut it without control over cover point. There was no shortage of short stuff; Clarke got a bouncer first ball and stared down Aaron after he delivered it; Watson looked less comfortable against Ishant Sharma, swaying away and almost toppling over.

India generally started off bowling too short though, and Aaron could learn a lot from Sharma’s control. A flurry of late wickets came when the new ball was pitched up after tea. Four scalps in the evening session, including that of Warner, made India feel better about their day’s performance.

As a further tribute to Hughes the Australian team lined their bats up against an advertising hording next to the gate on the boundary. On each bat handle hung a Baggy Green cap.

Sean Abbot, meanwhile, returned to cricket for the first time since bowling the bouncer that fatally injured Hughes. He sent down a short ball with his fifth delivery playing for New South Wales back at the SCG; a small detail in a match report - he also took two wickets on day one against Queensland - but a huge step in his mental recovery.
