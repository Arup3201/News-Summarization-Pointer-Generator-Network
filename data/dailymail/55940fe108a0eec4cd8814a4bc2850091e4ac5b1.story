Many towns spend thousands of pounds a year to remove graffiti off the walls of buildings and monuments.

But a piece of reverse graffiti in Connecticut has become a popular local attraction after a talented artist designed a beautiful oak tree that only appears when it rains.

Unlike usual graffiti, which is washed away by heavy downpours, Adam Niklewicz' reverse graffiti only becomes visible when touched by water and disappears again when it dries.

Popular graffiti: Polish born artist Adam Niklewicz has created a reverse graffiti image of an oak tree in Connecticut that can only be seen when it rains

First step: Adam Niklewicz pictured drawing the the outline for the stencil of an oak tree

Hugh project: Adam Niklewicz then created a stencil of the Charter Oak Tree - Connecticut's official tree - to the correct size

The Polish born artist has been creating reverse graffiti since 2009 when he experimented with using waterproofing treatments on bricks to create the artworks.

The artwork, which on located on the side of a former synagogue in downtown Hartford and commissioned by the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Real Art Ways and the City of Hartford, is of the state's official tree - a Charter Oak.

Mr Niklewicz, who is in his mid fifties, said: 'It's a conceptual mural which is built on a brick wall and the basic idea is a giant image of an oak tree.

'I noticed that when water is applied to untreated concrete it changes colour.

Big structure: Adam Niklewicz, pictured left, then stuck the stencil to the side of a former synagogue in downtown Hartford

Piece by piece: Adam Niklewicz cut the stencils into small square and then put them back together on the wall

Time consuming: Adam Niklewicz then had to painstakingly cut out the markings on each stencil

'I wanted the tree to appear with the rain, staying there throughout the rain and then slowly disappearing when the wall dries up.

'That little element of magic is what were after and that's what good art is about, its about surprising the viewer.'

Mr Niklewicz recalls using this technique as a child, spraying water on the pavements to make basic pictures and patterns.

To create the piece, Mr Niklewicz drew the giant picture on hundreds of small square stencils before spending three days creating graphite transfers of every section.

Technical: Adam Niklewicz then strayed the completed stencil with a waterproofing formula

Revelation: When the stencil was removed, the wall was sprayed with water to reveal the image of the Charter Oak tree

End result: The detailed image of a Charter Oak tree appears as the wall is sprayed with water

It then took another two days sticking the stencils to the wall before a final three days cutting the stencil to the final picture before spraying the wall with waterproofing formula.

'It's a wonderful feeling, I love getting dirty when working on art. I had two other artists helping me on this and it's nice that we're all speaking the same language.

'The beauty of this project is that this hasn't been a compromise of my artistic integrity, if anything my original smallish idea has blossomed into realisation

'This has been an amazing opportunity for me and I'm really grateful to everyone who has helped me with this project.'

Piece of magic: Adam Niklewicz wanted to create a piece of artwork that would surprise the viewer

Local attraction: The wall is sprayed with water several times a day so members of the public can see it

Finishing touches: It took five days in total to stencil the wall and spray it with formula

Job well done: Adam Niklewicz, pictured in front of his latest artwork, has been creating reverse graffiti since 2009
