You may have thought recruitment to MI6 was wrapped in a veil of secrecy – involving mysterious brown envelopes or a tap on the shoulder.

But the Secret Intelligence Service has decided to take the more traditional approach of advertising in a national newspaper.

The tongue-in-cheek advert, taken out in The Sunday Times, rubbishes the notion of James Bond-style  ‘high-speed chases and shoot-outs’, instead saying the qualities looked for are ‘far more ordinary’.

It even suggests that while MI6 does have an ‘international focus’ many  of its jobs are based in London and  ‘fit well with family life’.

The advert also states that spies often need more ‘subtle’ qualities, such as ‘the simple ability to get on with all sorts of people from all kinds of cultures’.

In a reference to John le Carre’s novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, the ad also pokes fun at the ‘Tinker, Tailor image of the hyper-intelligent, slightly, dysfunctional oddball’.

Dismissing the stereotype, the Secret Service says that ‘in fact, you’ll find that we value both emotional intelligence and academic achievement’.

In the full-page advertisement,, MI6 also dismisses the ‘white, male stereotype’, instead saying ‘the truth is we don’t care what sex you are or where you’re from, as long as you’re a British national’.

Bosses also opened the job up to as many candidates as possible, saying that they ‘don’t care what you do now, only what you can do’.

But while the campaign is one of MI6’s most open recruitment drives, it still emphasises the need for secrecy, telling possible candidates that they cannot discuss their application with anybody.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said that the campaign is ‘designed to attract people from a wide variety of backgrounds who have the skills we are looking for, but for various reasons may not have considered a career in MI6’.

The spokesman added: ‘It is crucial that we continue to protect British interests both at home and abroad, so we need to ensure that we have the right skills and capability to do that.

‘As people move on from the Service, it is important that we continue to ensure talented people consider the Service as a career.’

Earlier this month, MI5, the UK’s internal security agency, announced that it was seeking to hire as many as 100 recruits as young as 18 to ‘take a degree in spying’ instead of going to university.

MI5 bosses also sought to expel the ‘myth’ that a career in the intelligence services is ‘the preserve of privately educated men’.

The Foreign Office said it wanted to harness the talents of the ‘XBox generation’ who have grown up with social networking sites, global internet connections and interactive gaming.
