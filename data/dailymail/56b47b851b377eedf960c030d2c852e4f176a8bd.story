Can't make a loved one's funeral? Don't worry, a cemetery is now offering the chance to watch services live on a 4G mobile phone.

Kemnal Park Cemetery and Memorial Gardens, in Chislehurst, south-east London, claims it is the first in the country to offer the high speed video feed of funeral services directly from the graveside.

Grieving families can request a cameraman records the proceedings, which are streamed live over the network used by new smartphones.

Kemnal Park Cemetery and Memorial Gardens, in Chislehurst, south-east London has become the first in the country to offer a live 4G video feed of funeral services directly from the graveside

The package is aimed at friends and family who live abroad and are unable to travel, or those who are infirm and unable to leave their home.

Users can watch and listen to the broadcast by logging on to a password-protected website on a computer, mobile phone, or tablet.

The Â£450 charge includes a professional cameraman, equipment, and wireless 4G data charges. Families can also request a hard copy recording of proceedings for to watch later.

Some cemeteries and crematoria already offer live streaming from within the chapel using fixed cameras and a wired broadband connection.

But bosses at Kemnal Park say this is the first time families have been able to request a wireless, graveside recording with a roaming camera. It is available for burials and cremation services.

Michael Burke, operations director at Kemnal Park, said: 'Our new 4G service is as close as you can get a funeral service without actually being there.

'We are taking advantage of the latest technology to beam high quality video and audio around the world in real-time.

'It is ideal for friends and family who are unable to travel to Kemnal Park but still wish to pay their respects.'

He added: 'People use their mobile phones to record everything they see these days, but they draw a line at funeral services, because they see it as morbid.

Kemnal Park covers an area of 55 acres, has 30,000 grave spaces, and a chapel that houses up to 500 mourners

'However, they do realise it may be nice to relive memorable moments at a later date, perhaps if a young relative sings, or somebody delivers a particularly poignant eulogy.

'We are now able to film that for them, and have had a lot of demand from people who do want a recording but do not want to do it themselves. Our new 4G streaming service takes things a little bit further.

'We now foresee the time when celebrities will welcome their fans watching their service remotely, away from immediate family and friends.'

Funeral director Michael Killick, from J and R Killick, in West Wickham, south-east London, described the service as an 'excellent extra'.

Mr Killick, who conducted the first streamed service, said: 'There are times when it can be impractical for some family members to attend a funeral at short notice. That may be because of distance or their own health.

'But just about everywhere now has access to the internet, so we see this 'virtual service' as an excellent extra option to be able to offer a family.'

He added: 'I found it very moving that the grandson and his wife who reside in New Zealand were able to watch this service at 3am their time and still be part of the service at Kemnal Park.'

Kemnal Park covers an area of 55 acres, has 30,000 grave spaces, and a chapel that houses up to 500 mourners. It is used primarily by London residents and is expected to host around 800 services this year.
