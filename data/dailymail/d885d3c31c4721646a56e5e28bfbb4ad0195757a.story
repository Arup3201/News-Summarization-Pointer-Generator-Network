Elle Wright’s eight-year-old daughter wants nothing more than to be a boy.

In a tell-all article for Daily Life, Ms Wright said: ‘I was driving along in the car recently when my daughter Ruby [name changed] asked if she could go to the doctor's and get a penis.'

She said her breath caught in her throat and she tried to stay calm as she told her daughter she would ‘have to Google it when I got home’.

Gender confusion: Elle Wright is determined to support her daughter, who wants to be a boy, no matter what she decides about her future

The mother, who runs a clothing store in Byron Bay on the north coast of New South Wales in Australia, said Ruby had never been interested in ‘girly’ clothes or toys.

She said: ‘Ruby only wanted to play with Tonka trucks and tool belts. By the time she was three, she simply refused to wear anything remotely girlish.’

The eight-year-old now wanted to be called ‘Jack Black’, and wore her hair short with a swept-over, Justin-Bieber-style fringe. 

'At eight years of age, Ruby is still so young, and I have no idea what the next few years will bring. But this has been present in Ruby forever, so I'm not going to overlook or ignore it... ‘I have no idea what the future holds for Ruby, but whatever the outcome, I’m firmly in her corner and we’ll tackle it as a team'

Ruby, whom strangers often mistook for a boy, also enjoys playing ‘rough-and-tumble games’, walks with a swagger, rides skateboards and surfs like a pro.

When strangers call her ‘mate’ or ‘boy’, Ruby never corrects them - and Ms Wright said she barely noticed it anymore.

Until recently, Ruby had only ever wanted to play with boys. Lately she had started to play with girls - but Ms Wright said: ‘It’s definitely a different dynamic.’

The issue of Ruby's gender identity came to a head when her class went on a school camp. Boys and girls were made to sleep in different tents and Ruby was heartbroken when she was put in the girls’ tent.

Ms Wright said: ‘She tried to cajole the volunteer parents into believing she was a boy, but didn’t succeed.'

Two years ago, the headmaster of Ruby's school called Ms Wright into the office and suggested that Ruby might be more than just a tomboy. He advised Ms Wright to start researching gender identity issues and to contact support groups so she could provide Ruby with the information she needed.

Ms Wright said she did not know what the future held for Ruby, and while she did not ‘feel the need to label it at this young age’, she also wanted to be aware of the issues and supportive of her child.

She added: ‘At eight years of age, Ruby is still so young, and I have no idea what the next few years will bring. But this has been present in Ruby forever, so I'm not going to overlook or ignore it.

'Once, a couple of mothers suggested I must have wanted a son because of the way I encourage Ruby to dress and behave as she does. I was shocked. I ran away and got into my car shaking with anger. I'd never felt more judged. I've also never been more resolute about letting Ruby be herself'

‘I understand that puberty can be a time of great distress for kids who have gender confusion. Depression and suicide are risks at this time. I believe with love and support you can tackle anything, so I'm going to be as prepared as I can be with information to help Ruby with whatever direction she chooses for her life.’

One option available for children who show evidence of gender dysphoria – where they feel discontent with their sex – is to take drugs that delay the onset of puberty, to give them more time to decide whether they want to begin the process of gender reassignment. 

Ms Wright said she knew it might be a rocky road ahead for her daughter, and she had already faced criticism from other parents.

'Once, a couple of mothers suggested I must have wanted a son because of the way I encourage Ruby to dress and behave as she does. I was shocked. I ran away and got into my car shaking with anger. I'd never felt more judged. I've also never been more resolute about letting Ruby be herself.

‘I can’t imagine how confusing it must be to feel you’re not in the right skin.

‘I have no idea what the future holds for Ruby, but whatever the outcome, I’m firmly in her corner and we’ll tackle it as a team.’
