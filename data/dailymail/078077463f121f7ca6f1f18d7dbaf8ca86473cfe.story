Rep. Mark Sanford said Wednesday that claims made by his ex-wife Jenny in their contentious divorce, including that he gets drunk and does illegal and prescription drugs in front of their youngest son, are 'preposterous, crazy and wrong.'

While the motion filed in a family court last week by attorneys for Jenny Sanford asked a judge to restrict both parents
from being under the influence of drugs or 
excessive amounts of alcohol while caring for their son Blake, it stated that Mark Sanford's actions were the reason for the filing.

Jenny Sanford also asked a judge to limit the 
Congressman's visits with their teenage son and for the court 
to require her former husband to undergo psychological tests and take 
anger management and parenting courses.

'Since the time of the divorce I have tried to do everything in my power to be both a good dad and a former husband. It seems that nothing I can do at this point is enough, appropriate or adequate,' he said.

Sanford, then South Carolina governor, disappeared for five days in 2009 only to return from Argentina to acknowledge an affair with a woman to whom he is now engaged.

Jenny Sanford sued for a divorce, which was granted in 2010. The couple has four sons, ranging in age from 15 to 22.

Mark Sanford was elected last year to a congressional seat that he held for three terms in the 1990s before becoming governor.

The court motion filed by Jenny Sanford last week also requested the couple be restrained from 
making disparaging comments about each other in front of their son and exposing him to overnight visits from a member of the opposite sex 'who could reasonably be construed as a paramour.'

'Divorce has many different tragedies and in some cases, unfortunately, unrelenting bitterness seems to be one of them,' Mark Sanford said in response to his ex-wife's claims.

'I have avoided responding to these sorts of things as best I could over the past five years and I want to continue to do so.

'But when accusations are made that would suggest inadequacy in my role as a father or in adequacy in my professional role as a congressman, they have to be addressed,' he proclaimed.

Sanford added: 'I think anybody who knows me in the Lowcountry knows that these accusations are false.'

Sanford's district is along the lower South Carolina coast, also known as the Lowcountry.

Jenny Sanford declined to comment on the recent court filings on Tuesday when contacted by the Associated Press.

'I have no comment on this private matter other than to say that the restraints and other relief requested are common or standard practices frequently requested to protect minor children in similar custody situations,' she said in a statement.
