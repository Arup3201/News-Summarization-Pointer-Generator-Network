An official at Sharjah Police said: 'The suspect was caught wearing women’s clothes. The park was exclusively for women on that day.

'He was walking around the park in the abaya enjoying his time there.'

Religious control: Despite many foreign visitors and expatriates in UAE cities like Dubai, the country maintains its strict Muslim rules on public conduct

Sharjah is considered the strictest of the United Arab Emirates and it is the only emirate where alcohol is completely banned.

Their
‘Decency and Public Conduct Rules and Objectives’ came in to force in 
2001 and dictates a conservative dress code for men and women.

It also includes a ban on unmarried men and women being alone ‘in public places, or in suspicious times or circumstances’.
