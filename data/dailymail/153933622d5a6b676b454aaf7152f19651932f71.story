Two conservative American bloggers who were planning on speaking at a right-wing rally in the UK this weekend, will not be allowed to enter the country.

Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer are the founders of the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America and they run the website Jihad Watch.

Both were planning on speaking at an English Defence League march Saturday in Woolwich, but the Home Office has barred them from traveling to the UK.

Access denied: Conservative American bloggers Pamela Geller, left, and Robert Spencer, right, have been banned from entering the UK to attend an upcoming anti-Islamic rally

The two have been banned on the basis that their presence would bot be 'conductive to the public good.'

In letters sent to Geller and Spencer, the Home Department explains that it can expel, deport, or deny entry to any non-UK national who violates the British government's 'Unacceptable Behavior' policy.

The Home Office explained their decision to The Guardian: 'We can confirm that Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer are subject to an exclusion decision...We condemn all those whose behaviors and views run counter to our shared values and will not stand for extremism in any form.'

Matthew Collins of the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate was 'absolutely delighted' by the decision to ban the bloggers.

'These two are among some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world. They've nothing to contribute to life in this country...They only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble. Britain doesn't need more hate even just for a few days.'

Both Geller and Spencer took to their blogs to voice their outrage over the decision.

Spencer explained that he and Geller planned to lay a wreath at the memorial to British solider Lee Rigby, who was recently  beheaded by jihadists in Woolwich.

Murder: Soldier Lee Rigby was beheaded in Woolwich on May 22 by two men who said they killed Rigby in order to avenge the killing of Muslims by the British military

Target: The rally planned for Saturday is in response to the killing of Lee Rigby, a drummer in the British military who was off-duty when he was attacked and beheaded

'But it is not conducive to the public good in Britain to oppose Jihad violence and Islamic supremacism,' Spencer wrote.

'In not allowing us into the country solely because of our true and accurate statements about Islam, the British government is behaving like a de facto Islamic state. The nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead,' Geller wrote.

Geller pointed out on The Blaze that she hadn't been charged or convicted of any crime.

'I became a writer and activist in the wake of 911. For this I am banned. I shed no tears. I am banned from Mecca, too,' Geller said. 

Tommy Robinson, the EDL leader, was also
 outraged, saying the decision was 'embarrassing for this so-called land
 of democracy and freedom of speech.'

Not free to speak: Geller expressed her outrage at being banned from the UK on her blog saying, 'The nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead'

Against the ban: English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson described the banning as 'embarrassing for this so-called land of democracy and freedom of speech'

The EDL rally Geller and Spencer planned to attend was in response to the beheading of British soldier Lee Rigby last month by two Islamic extremists.

EDL has gotten more riled up by the beheading, having recently graffitied the side of a mosque in Redditch, Worcestershire. The mosque was tagged with the initials EDL, NF, KKK and a swastika.

Police have still not caught those responsible for the mosque vandalism.
