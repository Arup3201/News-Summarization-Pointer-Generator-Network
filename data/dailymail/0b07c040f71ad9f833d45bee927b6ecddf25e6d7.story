Officers arresting a fugitive who 
had escaped from prison almost 40 years ago said the moment that they put the churchgoing grandfather in handcuffs this week was 'bittersweet'.

Michael Ray Morrow was sentenced in 
1973 to five years in California state prison for 
armed robbery in Long Beach. Four years into his sentence he escaped, claiming that other inmates wanted to kill him.

The law finally caught up with 70-year-old Morrow on Monday at his home in Jessieville, Arkansas where he had been living quietly as Carl Frank Wilson, a grandfather who attended church every Sunday.

Tale of two lives: Michael Ray Morrow (pictured left around 40 years ago) escaped jail in California and took up the alias Carl Frank Wilson. The elderly grandfather had been on the run for 36 years when he was arrested this week (right)

Detective Sgt Joel Ware, from Garland County Sheriff's Department, told ABC: 'It's good to have him answer to justice,
but to take an elderly person with medical issues, who has otherwise 
lived a quiet, peaceful life, never causing any problems, went to church
every Sunday, it was bittersweet.'

The officer said that Morrow had been very cooperative during his arrest but emotional although there appeared to be some relief after he had spent the past three decades always looking over his shoulder. 

Morrow had been living as law-abiding Mr Wilson for 36 years. He had got married and had three children and grandchildren.

His family were unaware that the elderly grandfather had been living under an alias and had fled a criminal past.

Morrow is being held on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He is in Garland County Jail waiting to be extradited to California.

Morrow had escaped from the California Institute for Men in Chino on August 27, 1977, federal authorities said, while serving time for first-degree robbery.

He has not yet revealed how he escaped from prison but Sgt Ware said it was a 'pretty good plan'.

Morrow was finally tracked down after investigators matched his fingerprints to those of a man using the name of Carl Frank Wilson, who was arrested in Saline County, Arkansas, in 1984.

Some neighbors told ArkansasMatters.com they knew Murrow had been incarcerated before but they had no idea he had escaped prison.

'You
live beside somebody for fourteen years, but you really don't know 
them. You thought you knew them. That's what's spooky,' neighbor Randy 
Edmonds told the station.

'We knew him as Frank, but he was a good neighbor we never had any trouble with him. He was just up here raising a family,' Sherry Miller told Channel 7 News.

She was neighbors with Morrow for more than 20 years.

Arkansas FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kimberly Brunell said: 'This case is special in that he escaped so many years ago, but it just highlights law enforcement working together.'
