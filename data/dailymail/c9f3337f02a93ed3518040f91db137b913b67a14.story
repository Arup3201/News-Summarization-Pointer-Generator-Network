Hillary Clinton has been accused of ignoring official advice issued by her office while Secretary of State against using private email addresses by using her own server housed in her New York home. 

The leading Democratic presidential hopeful has faced criticism for using her @clintonemail.com email address for official government business, especially during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the US consulate based in the Libyan city of Benghazi.

According to leaked diplomatic cables, the State Department warned employees against using their own private email addresses for official business.

In the memo, which according to Fox News, was unclassified, State Department officials were advised to 'avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts'. They were also warned against using 'auto-forward' tools to channel emails to their own accounts. 

Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department following the revelations.

The cable advised State Department officials that 'online adversaries' had attempted to hack into the private email accounts of its employees. 

The June 2011 advice contained in the cable only applied to 'sensitive but unclassified' information. 

This could include personal information of State Department officials or members of the public, business secrets, plus ongoing investigations or records about visa or asylum applications. 

The cable was signed Hillary Clinton, but it is not apparent whether she was aware of its content as many official memos would bear her name if she was in Washington at the time. 

Fox News contacted an unnamed computer hacker as part of its own investigation into the Clinton email issue, who used a publicly available tool called 'The Harvester' to determine how many email addresses Clinton used while at the State Department. 

According to the hacker: 'Given the sequential similarities to hdr22@ I suspect some others found by my search may also have been used by HRC. 

'I suspect hdr18 -hdr21 may have been used by HRC as well as h@clintonemail.com and hillary@clintonemail.com....I’d also be interested to learn if there were ever hdr1@ thru hdr17@.'

Clinton's staff maintained that the former Secretary of State only used the one email address, understood to be hdr22@clintonemail.com.

However, the hacking expert claimed several slightly different email accounts existed, which may have been used by the Democratic hopeful. 

Clinton's critics fear she has been able to control what information will be made public as she will have control over the data.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, the government can censor or withhold emails to protect information that would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas. It wasn't clear whether the State Department would automatically apply those provisions to its review of Clinton's emails, or use its discretion to release even emails that might be covered under those exemptions.

Withholding emails merely because they might be embarrassing or expose government incompetence or malfeasance is not permitted under the act's guidelines.

More than 11,000 people have sought access to Clinton's emails under the Freedom of Information Act since the use of a private system has been revealed.
