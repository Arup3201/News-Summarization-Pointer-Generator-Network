A water buffalo went on a rampage in China's Sichuan Province, injuring 14 people and damaging vehicles in its path.

State media released security footage showing the buffalo running through streets and chasing after people in Leshan City.

The animal ran through the streets for around 40 minutes before four police officers killed the animal by shooting it 10 times, local police told state broadcaster CCTV.

Speaking from her hospital bed, she said: 'I was riding a red bicycle, and it just kept chasing after my bicycle.

The seriousness of her injuries is not known.
