'Callous': Michelle Christie, pictured after having her head shaved for charity, stole more than £9,000 from her 95-year-old neighbour

A charity fund-raiser offered to help care for a 95-year-old neighbour then stole £9,000 from his life savings.

'Callous' Michelle Christie, 41, who was paid £15 per week to collect Peter MacKinnon's pension and help with odd jobs around his house in Elgin, Scotland, used the elderly man's Post Office card and PIN number to steal from him over a period of six months, a court heard.

Christie, who once shaved her head for charity and was well-known in the area for her fundraising efforts, pleaded guilty to stealing from the pensioner at Elgin Sheriff Court yesterday.

She admitted stealing a total of £9,100 from the war veteran over several occasions between November 2012 and April 2013.

Mr McKinnon's niece, Rosemary Thompson, described the former car mechanic as a 'lovely, quiet, unassuming man' who has worked hard all his life.

She said Christie offered to help care for her elderly uncle when he fell ill at the end of last year, but it later emerged that money was disappearing from Mr McKinnon's bank account.

Neighbour Amanda Sim, 27, contacted police after she became suspicious of Christie.

'We were all shocked, first of all that she would do that to him, and more so shocked at the substantial amount she took,' Mrs Sim said.

'She was making out she was doing good for Peter, but all along she was stealing his money.

'Peter
still says "I'm just lost for words". He can't believe that someone 
would do that, and for the trust to be shattered,' she added.

'Shocked': Christie, 41, seen ahead of the charity head shave, was well known in Elgin for her fund-raising efforts, the court heard

Ms Thompson, who lives in England but visits her uncle in Elgin every few months, said: 'I have never known such a callous human being who makes herself out to be a charitable person whilst at the same time robbing a poor pensioner.'

Christie, of Elgin, is due to be sentenced on June 20.
