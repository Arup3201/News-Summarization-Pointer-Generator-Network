Tottenham are trying to sell or loan out players before they push forward on more major signings.

Technical director Franco Baldini is busy across Europe looking for a marketplace for some of their players.

Last summer's signings Roberto Soldado and Nacer Chadli are obvious candidates while Sandro, Paulinho, Kyle Naughton, Younes Kaboul, Michael Dawson, Andros Townsend and Kyle Walker have also attracted enquiries.

Tottenham have no desire to sell Walker but would consider suitable offers for the others.

Barcelona are understood to have put Walker's name down as one of their options to replace Dani Alves but the England international is not top of that list.

Soldado is one of a number of strikers interesting Atletico Madrid while Chadli has refused to go to PSV Eindhoven as part of the Memphis Depay deal and has interest from Sunderland among other Premier League sides.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has 32 senior players on his books, but can only select 25 for the 2014/15 campaign.

He said: 'We currently have 32 players so we need to be clinical in our selection. We have a week of hard work to go and there could be some changes. But I already have in my mind the personnel important for the game.'
