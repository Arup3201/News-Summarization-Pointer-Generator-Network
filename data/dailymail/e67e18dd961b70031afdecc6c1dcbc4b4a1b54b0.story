A 13-year-old boy has been fatally shot in his bed - just as his grandmother had started making plans to move him out of the neighborhood because it was too dangerous.

Nizzear Rodriguez celebrated his thirteenth birthday with his grandmother at Applebee's on Saturday night, and hours later he was killed in his bedroom in Carrollton, Georgia.

Witnesses heard gunfire between 1am and 3am on Sunday at the Bristol Lakes Apartments - but authorities believe the television in the home may have drowned out the sound, WSBTV reported.

Nizzear's body was found on Sunday afternoon by a relative who went to wake him up.

His family was trying to put the boy into a car to rush him to hospital when authorities arrived on Sunday afternoon. He could not be saved.

Investigators are still looking at the possibility that the suspect in the killing, 17-year-old Malik Davis, intended to shoot someone else, 11Alive reported. 

It is not known if the boys knew each other, but investigators said that Davis was known to other residents of the apartment complex. 

The alleged killer was charged with murder, burglary and firearm possession after his mother convinced him to turn himself in to police, authorities said. 

A second suspect is still on the run.

Nizzear's family and other neighbors told 11Alive that the neighborhood has been troubled by gang activity in recent years.

Sweet: Nizzear was described as a top student and friendly neighbor who had lived with his grandmother since he was five. She was looking to move because of how dangerous the area has become

Fears: Neighbors said the Bristol Lakes Apartments in Carrollton, Georgia were having problems with gangs

Kanisha Osorio, Rodriguez's aunt, said that before his death, his grandmother had been making plans to move the family because the apartment complex was so dangerous.

'He seen some people pulling some guns out and the cops were out here he was crying about "I've got to get out of here",' Osorio said.

Rodriguez's grandmother has had legal custody of the boy since he was five.

Authorities said the police had never had any interactions with the victim, who was described as a top student who helped neighbors cut their lawns.

'Nizzear was a wonderful student, well liked and always smiling,' principal Dr. Todd Simpson said in a statement. 'This is a difficult day for this school and the entire system. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Nizzear's family during this difficult time.'

Davis was known to authorities, they said.
