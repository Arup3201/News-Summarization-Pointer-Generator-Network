Decay: Pope Francis has attacked Rome's 'moral decay', citing child prostitutes and busy soup kitchens in his adopted home city as examples of society's downfall

Pope Francis has attacked Rome's 'moral decay', citing child prostitutes and busy soup kitchens in his adopted home city as examples of society's downfall.

The 77-year-old Pontiff spoke of the 'tremendous pain' he felt over the darker side of the city in an interview to mark the feasts of Saints Peter and Paul.

He also hit out at economic struggles, unemployment and Italy's falling birth rate, as well as expressing the view that communists had 'stolen' the flag of Christianity.

Describing the exploitation of children as something that makes him 'suffer', the Pope told Rome-based newspaper Il Messaggero that he had been sickened to learn that in his native Buenos Aires there were girls as young as 12 working as prostitutes.

'It made me sick. But even more so to see the powerful cars driven by old men pull up,' he told the newspaper's Vatican correspondent Franca Giansoldati.

'They could have been their grandfathers. The little girl would be made up and the men would pay 15 pesos which would go towards buying drugs.

'For me, the people who do this to girls are are paedophiles.

'It also happens in Rome. The Eternal City, which should be a beacon in the world, is a mirror of society's moral decay.'

Asked whether he was more afraid of the moral degradation, or the material poverty of a city, Francis said that both made him 'afraid', adding that people were having to turn to soup kitchens in Rome in order to feed their families.

'An auxiliary bishop of Rome told me that many people go to the soup kitchen and in secret, full of shame, take home food,' he said.

The Pope also blamed Europe's economic struggles for a falling birth rate, both in Italy and other European countries as people worried they could not afford to start a family.

'People are afraid of losing their jobs or not being able to pay the rent,' he said.

'Social policy does not help. Italy has a very low birth rate, and in Spain it is the same. France is a bit better, but it is also low.

'It is as if Europe has grown tired of being a mother, and would instead prefer to be a grandmother.

'Much of this is caused by the economic crisis, not just from a cultural shift marked by selfishness and hedonism.'

But the Pontiff did have some positive marks for his new home, saying he found the people of Rome 'really likeable'.

'I wish for them not to lose their joy, hope, and faith, despite the difficulties,' he said.

Pope Francis was also asked about a blog post in the Economist magazine, which described him as sounding like a Leninist due to his criticism of capitalism and calls for economic reform.

'I can only say that the communists have 
stolen our flag. The flag of the poor is Christian. Poverty is at the 
centre of the Gospel,' he said, citing Biblical passages about the need 
to help the poor, the sick and the needy.

'Communists say that all this is communism. Sure, twenty centuries later. So when they speak, one can say to them: "but then you are Christian",' he said.

Since his election in March 2013, Francis has often attacked the global economic system as being insensitive to the poor and not doing enough to share wealth with those who need it most.

On Sunday Francis led his first major public ceremony since health problems forced a spate of cancelled appointments, and appeared to hold up well during the 90-minute Mass in St Peter's Basilica to honour Saints Peter and Paul.

The Vatican has played down the cancellations, including one at the last minute on Friday, attributing them without elaboration to some mild health problem.

Francis chatted with each of 24 archbishops kneeling before him to receive a white woollen band symbolising shared episcopal power.

He later addressed the faithful gathered in St Peter's Square and appealed for Iraq's leaders to save the nation from further warfare.

Francis then did what he has started doing recently when greeting the public - asking for prayers for him, too. 'Please don't forget to pray for me,' he said.

These requests for prayers, combined with his recent quip that a pope's job could be unhealthy and the cancellation of several appointments in the last few weeks, fuelled concern that perhaps Francis was seriously ill.

The Vatican insisted on Friday 'there are no reasons to worry about the pope's health'.
