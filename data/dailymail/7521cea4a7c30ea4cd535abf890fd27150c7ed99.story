Elisabeth Carroll was discovered in the living room after her husband told his boss: 'I think I've killed Liz'

A printer who was racked with money worries strangled his wife of 23-year-years and then told his boss: 'I won't be in today - I think I’ve killed Liz'.

Cash-strapped Michael Carroll, 60, attacked his wife Elizabeth, 64, at their home, a jury was told.

The laminator had defaulted on mortgage payments and had been ordered to pay the remaining £75,000 of his interest-only mortgage within five years.

When his wife was made redundant the financial stress became too much for him and he snapped, Cambridge Crown Court heard.

Mr Carroll attacked his wife of 23 years in their living room - while he was wearing his pyjamas and she was still in her dressing gown and nightie.

Injuries to her shoulder detected during a postmortem showed she had tried to fight back during the struggle.

When Mr Carroll - who was 'always punctual' - failed to show up at work the next morning his boss Vernon MacFarlane called him.

But the laminator explained he wouldn’t be able to make it in, adding: 'I think I’ve killed Liz.'

The day before Elisabeth’s death, Mr Carroll left work at 4.45pm as usual, but when he didn’t turn up for work the next morning Mr MacFarlane grew concerned about him.

Mr MacFarlane rung him at around 10am. He told the court: 'I rang him and asked if he was well and he said no.

'I said "you'd better get yourself over to see a doctor", and he said "It's a bit late for that".

'I said "Why, what's wrong?" And he said "I think I've killed Liz".

'At this stage I didn’t really believe she was dead and I said "have you called an ambulance or the police?" He said no.

'I asked him if I should do it and he said yes.

'I put the phone down and was a bit shocked, so I told my brother the story and asked him to ring the ambulance for me.'

Peter Gair, prosecuting, said police were called and Mr Carroll answered the door of his ground floor flat in his pyjamas, telling police officers his wife’s body was in the living room.

Mr Gair said it was clear she had been held down during a struggle.

Mr MacFarlane told the court he had employed Mr Carroll at Mac Print Finishing in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, for 12 years.

The senior partner explained he had noticed the employee's stress levels rising in the two weeks before Mrs Carroll’s death and had tried to help him.

He said: 'After knowing someone for nine years one would think you’d know someone well.

'It was very difficult to converse with him. When I asked him what was wrong he said he had to pay his mortgage and he didn’t think he could.

'He had to pay £75,000 in five years and that was what was worrying him.

'He just kept saying £75,000 over and over.'

'After tax the couple had a combined income of £1,100 a month. Their combined net disposable income was £360 a month' 

Mr MacFarlane also told the court: 'I made an appointment for him to go and see Citizens’ Advice, but he did not go.'

Mr Carroll and his wife were living off just £83 a week as they attempted to stay on top of their mortgage payments.

He had taken out an interest only mortgage in 1989 and was approaching full term for the loan when he would have to pay a lump sum of £75,000 for his home.

A financial advisor told the court the Carrolls had failed to take out an endowment policy and did not have enough in pensions to cover the cost.

Mortgage consultant Ian Cooper told the jury he had been discussing loan options with the couple, who did not want to sell their home.

Mr Carroll earned £13,624 a year while Elisabeth Carroll received just £2,340 a year 'probably from her pension' after she had been made redundant in the 1990s, the court heard.

Mr Cooper explained after tax the couple had a combined income of £1,100 a month.

They paid an estimated £460 a month towards their mortgage interest, which left them with a net disposable income to live on of just £360 a month.

From that the couple had to eat and also hoped to service a loan of £74,500 so they could keep their home.

It meant Mr Carroll's plans to retire at 65, set out in a will signed in October 2011, appeared unlikely.

Mr Cooper said: 'The plan that they applied for was affordable.'

As Mr Carroll's financial situation worsened, friends said he became so quiet and introverted someone had to drive him home after work one day.

The court was told Mrs Carroll had overcome bowel cancer but was relatively healthy before her death.

Carroll, from Fletton, Peterborough, is accused of with killing his wife Elisabeth at their home at around 7am, on 24 May 2012.

He has denied the murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
