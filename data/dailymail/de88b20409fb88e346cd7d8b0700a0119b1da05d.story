You can have your cake and drink it too- if you can stomach it- with Starbucks most recent sweet treat, the Strawberry Cheesecake Frappuccino.

The iced beverage was unleashed on Australia this week, causing a stir when several worried customers spotted a suspiciously labelled  'cheese' syrup going into their cup.

While the drink might come as good news to caffeine lovers who normally have to buy their cake and coffee separately, an image of the cheese syrup prompted a panic on social media about 'nacho lattes'.

Starbucks Australia has launched their new Strawberry Cheesecake Frappuccino to the shock of customers

'One nacho bell grande latte, please,' said one social media user, with another quipping that the drink should be renamed a 'frappucheetos'. 

The syrup was soon discovered to be shorthand for 'cheesecake', with a representative from the company explaining to Mashable that 'the bottled syrup is a flavor ingredient infused with sweet creamy flavors'.

Several customers who tried the drink were still unsure what to make of the cake-and-coffee blend. 

'I just cannot deal with it. The smell is awful, I tried one today, the drink was fine but the cheese whip was too much,' said one user. 

'OH sweet lord who would drink that. WHY IS THIS EVEN A THING?' asked another.

Considering that the venti strawberry cheesecake frappuccino will set you back between 1500 and 2000 kilojoules, depending on whether you're inclined to try a tall, grande, or venti, investing in the iced drink may end up costing more than just money. 

First released in the Asia Pacific region last year, the drink joins the ranks of the coffee giant's many other flavoured beverages, including the Sakura Frappuccino, which is only available in Japan.

'Inspired by one of the world's favourite (and most decadent) desserts, enjoy ice-cold creaminess swirled with our signature strawberry puree and a crunchy layer of cookie crumbles,' said the description on the Starbucks website.

'Top it off with a decadent cheesecake-inspired whipped cream, swirls of strawberry sauce and a few shakes of more cookie crumbles for a tasty summer treat unlike any other.'

The dessert-inspired delicacy is available only for a limited time, and is only in Australia until April this year, disappointing many avid Starbucks fans in the US.

'A strawberry cheesecake frappuccino? Looks like I need to take a trip to Australia,' said one social media user.

However, another was not as enthusiastic about the drinkable cake and coffee combo, commenting 'I threw up in my mouth, ugh...'.

Starbucks has struggled in Australia because of the nation’s well-developed European-inspired coffee culture. 

The company announced heavy losses in 2008, closing 61 of its 84 stores, and recorded further losses in 2014.

Nick Wailes, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Sydney, said that could not grab the local needs of the country.

'Starbucks failed to truly understand Australia's cafe culture,' he wrote for Food News Australia. 

The company most recently came under fire earlier when it announced the Australian launch of their new 'flat white', which some customers claimed was both absurd and misleading.

Many said that coffee was simply a regular cappuccino, and ridiculed the company's proud advertisement of the 'latte art dot' which adorned the top of the beverage, reported Mashable.
