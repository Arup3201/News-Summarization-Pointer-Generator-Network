An 81-year-old grandmother who fell outside a hospital had to lie in a  gutter in the rain while an ambulance came from seven miles away.

When it arrived 30 minutes later, paramedics merely drove Gladys Shepherd 300 yards round the corner to the hospital’s urgent care unit.

Her granddaughter Louise Woods said: ‘You’d think a hospital would be the best place to have an accident. I couldn’t believe it.’

Pregnant Louise Woods who went for help after her grandmother Gladys Shepherd fell in the grounds of a hospital. She said she 'couldn't believe' how the situation was dealt with

Mrs Shepherd was already at Burnley 
General Hospital when she fell, after visiting its memory assessment 
service. She slipped over as she waited for her granddaughter to bring 
her car round from the hospital car park.

Her face was cut and bruised, 
her legs, shoulder and arms were severely bruised and she was unable to 
get up. 

Heavily pregnant Mrs Woods could not lift her, and when she ran
 inside to get help, she was told no doctors were available and Mrs 
Shepherd would have to stay where she was until an ambulance arrived 
from Altham. She was told to ring the ambulance herself.

Mrs Woods, 26, from Clitheroe, said: ‘Three receptionists came running 
out with umbrellas but said there were no doctors available to check her
 over before moving her, so I would have to ring an ambulance.

Gladys fell just 300metres from the urgent care unit at Burnley General Hospital, Lancashire

‘We tried holding umbrellas over her and I took off my coat to cover her
 but she was still in a puddle. I even told them I would push her myself
 around to the urgent care centre in a wheelchair if someone would just 
help me get her off the floor.

‘You would have thought they would have spared a doctor for two minutes 
rather than wasting all those resources on sending an ambulance.

Gladys was left badly shaken by her ordeal

'The 
paramedic literally drove us to the hospital entrance, which I could 
easily have walked to. The way she was treated is disgusting.

‘Even when we got to the urgent care centre, things didn’t improve. We were left waiting for hours.

‘My frail gran was still in her wet clothes when she got home five hours later.

‘Gran has been really shaken up. She is covered in bruises. My family is
 making a formal complaint.

The indignity she had to go through makes 
all of this so much worse.’ Russ Mclean, chairman of Lancashire’s 
Patient Voices Group, said: ‘Common sense has not prevailed. The urgent 
care centre staff should have been contacted directly by the 
receptionist.’

A Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: ‘Staff in our 
Memory Assessment Service quickly reacted, providing blankets, gauze and
 umbrellas to shelter the lady.

‘If there is a possibility of a head injury or risk of fracture, it is 
not advisable for them to be moved until they have been assessed by an 
appropriate medical professional.’

A spokesman for the North West Ambulance Service said: ‘A 999 call was 
received ... the nearest available emergency ambulance was dispatched, 
which was in Altham.’

The trust said it was investigating the incident last Friday.
