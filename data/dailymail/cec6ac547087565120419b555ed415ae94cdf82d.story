Welfare agencies missed 50 chances to save a toddler who died from a methadone overdose after social workers failed to take him into care, a damning report has revealed.

Jayden Lee Green, who was just a month short of his second birthday, was found dead in his parents’ bed after overdosing on the heroin substitute in August last year.

The toddler, who was given the drug to sedate him, lived with his crack cocaine and heroin-addicted parents Jamie Green and Sonia Britton in a filthy flat in the St Georges area of Bristol.

A serious case review, commissioned by 
Bristol Safeguarding Children Board, found there were more than 50 
'missed opportunities' by professional agencies to intervene which began even before he was born.

Tragic: Jayden Lee with his mother Sonia Britton who bought her son up with partner Jamie Green in a filthy 
flat in the St Georges area of Bristol. He was just a month short of his second birthday when he was found dead

Before his birth there were 
concerns that Britton was regularly injecting heroin while also taking 
methadone during the pregnancy. Following his birth he became subject of a child protection plan but that was discontinued.

A second child protection plan was commenced but moves to take Jayden Lee into care were never initiated, the review said.

During
this time Green and Britton continued to use heroin and methadone and 
were also were falsifying regular urine tests. They pair later admitted 
they 'knew the tricks to get around screening'.

The report also found that there was a lack of co-operation from Jayden Lee’s parents with all involved in dealing with them. This included drug agencies, midwifery, housing, health visitors, social workers and there were also regular failures to keep appointments or be at home when visits were made.

The report stated: 'What was lacking was the authoritative challenge to this lack of co-operation, there was a lack of enforcement of consequences. There was a lack of challenge by practitioners across the range of agencies.'

The report, which referred to Jayden Lee as 'Child K' throughout, continued: 'The extent of the parents’ lack of engagement, avoidance and dishonesty grew over time and although this was recognised by practitioners there was insufficient challenge by professional and no sustained, planned approach to protecting the child.

Failures: Jayden Lee pictured with his father Jamie Green. The report into his death stated that the extent of the parents’ lack of engagement, avoidance and dishonesty grew over time but professionals didn't challenge this

'The only way that Child K’s death would definitely have been prevented was if he had been placed away from his parents.

'The opportunity to do this was lost due to the failure to follow through on the initiation of care proceedings. However, a better-planned and authoritative approach to the family may also have prevented his death.'

It was revealed today that Jayden Lee suffered two head injuries - one at seven weeks and one at 11 weeks - and his parents gave the same explanation.

The report stated that this should have raised concerns that the injuries were not accidental.

The
boy also sustained injuries to his face at 21 and 23 months old and 
again the same explanations were given when he was seen by medical 
professionals.

Britton, 35, and Green, 33, were accused of killing their son by giving him the drug that they were both prescribed by doctors.

After
a three week trial at Bristol Crown Court, Green was convicted of 
manslaughter and causing cruelty to a child and jailed for nine years.

The
jury cleared Britton of manslaughter but convicted her of child cruelty
and causing or allowing the death of a child. She was jailed for four 
years.

The trial heard that
there were bags of rubbish lying around their one-bedroom ground floor 
rented flat, as well as drug paraphernalia kept in cupboards and crack 
pipes under the sink.

A rolled up cigarette was found in a child’s cot and there were also dirty potties.

Both
his parents were prescribed methadone and scientific tests showed the 
fatal dose administered to Jayden Lee was not the first time he had been
given the drug.

During the trial the court heard that several different agencies were monitoring Green and Britton in caring for their son but they were able to pull the wool over their eyes.

'Sonia Britton and Jamie Green were aware that health care professionals, drug workers as well as social services were monitoring their behaviour as well as trying to help them,' prosecutor William Mousley QC told jurors.

'They created an image with those professionals that they were looking after Jayden Lee. Of course nobody knew they were giving methadone to Jayden Lee.

'While both of them cared about Jayden Lee, he was not their priority. They were drug addicts, whose need for drugs came before Jayden Lee.'

Death: The report said that Jayden Lee's parents created an image with 
professionals that they were looking after him but no one 
knew they were giving him methadone. It said their need for drugs came before him

Prof Jones also called on the Government to publish guidance on the testing of children for methadone.

'One of the issues we are grappling with is when methadone is being prescribed, it is not being misused,' he said.

'In particular not being used as a tranquilliser or sedative with children.'

Prof
Jones added: 'We are looking for the Government to determine what ought
to be the national position in relation to the testing of children.'

Annie
Hudson, the city council’s strategic director for children and young 
people’s services, said: 'Bristol City Council fully accepts the 
recommendations made in the serious case review into the tragic death of
Jayden Lee Green.

'The 
administering of methadone to Jayden Lee was a deliberate act and one 
for which the parents are now serving a custodial sentences.

Jayden Lee with is father Jamie. Bristol City Council said at the time of his death there was no evidence of immediate risk to the child and it would have acted immediately had it known he was being given methadone

'However, at the time of his death there was no evidence of immediate risk to Jayden Lee.

'With hindsight, if we had known he was being given methadone, we would have acted immediately to place him away from harm.

'Many of the recommendations outlined in the findings of the report have already been implemented, including a new working group on substance misuse, revised guidance and protocol for practitioners, a review of services for drug-using patients and arrangements for prescribing methadone.

'Two events to improve and strengthen communications are under way.

'Our legal team has introduced new guidelines on how legal advice is given and improved monitoring of the progress of cases.'
