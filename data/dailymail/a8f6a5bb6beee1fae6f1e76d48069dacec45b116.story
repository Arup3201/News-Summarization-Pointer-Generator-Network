Guardian newspaper editor Alan Rusbridger, whose decision to publish Snowden's stolen files has been criticised

In Whitehall, the publication of the documents stolen by Edward Snowden is considered to have done more damage to the security services than any other event in history.

Feted as a hero by The Guardian, Snowden said he wanted to start a public debate on the widespread use of eavesdropping techniques by GCHQ and his former employer, the US National Security Agency (NSA).

But security officials are adamant there was no public interest in publishing top-secret information which details the precise methods used by agents to track terrorist plots.

They argue that – by pointing out which internet service providers, phone companies and other technology firms can be effectively monitored by GCHQ – fanatics were signposted to the places they should avoid when communicating.

GCHQ, in Cheltenham, is the organisation which gathers intelligence for both MI5 and MI6 – if it is compromised, so is the entire security apparatus of the country.

One Government official said that, in effect, The Guardian had helped to produce a ‘handbook’ for terrorists.

The internet is now rich with websites, based on the newspaper’s revelations, that explain the best way to communicate, while avoiding detection.

Whitehall insiders are scornful of the idea that The Guardian and Snowden – who is now holed up in Russia, after a whistle-stop visit to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong – needed to start a debate on State surveillance.

They point out that, for years, controversy has raged over (so far unsuccessful) attempts to give the security services and police more powers to spy on emails and internet visits, via the so-called snoopers’ charter.

There is also anger at the depiction of 
Snowden as a ‘whistle-blower’ by The Guardian. He downloaded files 
indiscriminately, not knowing what they contained.

But what most disturbs security officials is the knowledge that there are thousands more documents still in the possession of The Guardian, which – despite being warned of the grave threat to national security – continues to publish Snowden’s material.

It is also highly likely that China and Russia hold the information, given Snowden’s attempts to seek sanctuary there.

In August, Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office, warned the lives of British agents may have been put at risk by Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald and his partner David Miranda.

Mr Miranda was stopped by police at Heathrow airport on his way from Germany to the couple’s home in Brazil.

It later emerged that his flights had been paid for by The Guardian, and he was transporting nine hard disks and memory sticks, including secret files leaked by Snowden.

Some of the information – there were at least 58,000 documents in his possession – was so sensitive that British agents had to be moved for their own safety.

Mr Robbins said the material was likely to contain details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks, personal data about agents at home and abroad and ‘other intelligence activities vital to UK national security’.

At the time, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, branded the claims ‘unsubstantiated and inaccurate’. He said the newspaper had ‘held back a great deal’ of information from Snowden that might be harmful to Britain if it saw the light of day.
