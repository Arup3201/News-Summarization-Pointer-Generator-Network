Open winner Rory McIlroy is dating a 'travel sized' model from near his hometown, it was revealed today.

Weeks of speculation have surrounded the golfer's love-life ever since he broke off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki.

It emerged today that he has been seeing 23-year-old receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up.

New lover? Gale boasts on Twitter that 'being small is a blessing - I call it travel size'

Getting in the car: Miss Gale says online she likes 'fashion, whiskey, sunshine, travelling and fast cars'

Miss Gale boasts on Twitter that 'being small is a blessing - I call it travel sized.'

Her
 height means she may not suffer the same fate as 5ft 10in Wozniacki, 
who said she had to wear flat shoes while going out with 5ft 8in 
McIlroy.

The
 Sun reported today that McIlroy took former air stewardess Miss Gale 
out for a high-class meal at Chelsea Wine Bar in South Belfast to 
celebrate his victory in the Open last weekend.

A source told the paper the couple got together after meeting five weeks ago and their 'romance is blossoming'.

McIlroy, 25, had been spotted out with model Nadia Forde earlier this month, fuelling speculation they were an item.

But
 his meal with Miss Gale, who says online she likes 'fashion, whiskey, 
sunshine, travelling and fast cars', has buried those rumours.

The new relationship comes just two months after McIlroy split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki

McIlroy's ex Wozniacki recently tweeted this picture of herself in high heels after reportedly wearing flat shoes 'for three years' while with 5ft 8in McIlroy

Tellingly, 
Miss Gale started following McIlroy on Twitter earlier this month, about
 the time the pair are thought to have got together.

McIlroy,
 of Holywood, County Down, broke off his engagement from Danish sports 
star Wozniacki, 24, in May, just days after the couple had sent out 
their wedding invitations.

In
 what some interpreted as a dig at her former fiance, the tennis player 
recently wrote online: 'It's been three years since I have worn high 
heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood #looksgood #shopping #highheels'

McIlroy's
 new love comes after his two-shot victory at Royal Liverpool golf 
course on Sunday night made him only the third competitor from Northern 
Ireland to win the Open.

He
 met with Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy 
First Minister Martin McGuinness at Stormont Castle in Belfast yesterday
 to discuss his victory.

But
 he had to apologise to the pair for being unable to show off his prized
 Claret Jug, confessing 'it needed a good clean' after his big night out
 celebrating.
