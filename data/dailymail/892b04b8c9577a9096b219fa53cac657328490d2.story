Police have arrested two British men and are hunting a third after a holidaymaker plunged 50 feet from a luxury fifth-floor hotel in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Marbella.

The unnamed British tourist was seriously ill in hospital last night after the mystery incident.

Local media reports said the man had been thrown out of a window at the four-star Hotel Senator near Marbella town centre.

Plunge: Police have arrested two British men and are hunting a third after a holidaymaker plunged 50 feet from the Hotel Senator in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Marbella

Police confirmed they were investigating the incident, which happened around 8pm on Saturday, and that two people had been arrested.

A source said: 'As far as we are aware, all four including the injured man, are Brits.  

'The circumstances surrounding this incident are still being investigated.'

The injured man is understood to have been staying at the hotel with a friend.

He is said to have plunged four floors from the fifth floor of the hotel to a first-floor terrace during a row which occurred after the arrival of two other Brits.

The man police are hunting is one of those two Brits.

Treatment: The injured man is being treated at the nearby Costa del Sol Hospital. He is thought to have suffered head injuries although remarkably has no broken bones

All four are understood to be under 30, although their ages and names have not been released.

The injured Brit is being treated at the nearby Costa del Sol Hospital. He is thought to have suffered head injuries although remarkably has no broken bones. 

A report in one local paper that he had died in hospital was dismissed by a source close to the inquiry as false.

Staff at the Senator Hotel, a four-star spa hotel on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile overlooking the Med, declined to comment.

A receptionist said: ‘None of the bosses are around today. The hotel director would be the only person authorised to say anything.’
