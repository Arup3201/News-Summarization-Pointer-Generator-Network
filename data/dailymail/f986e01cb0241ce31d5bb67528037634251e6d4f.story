Canadian telecoms company Rogers and Bell already has Apple's hotly anticipated iTV device in its labs, a report in Canada's Globe and Mail has claimed.

Two unnamed sources speaking to the paper report that the flatscreen device will be voice controlled, using software similar to the Siri voice control on iPhone 4S, and will offer iPad-style apps.

It will also offer gesture control, with users able to manipulate apps from the sofa using hand gestures to type on an on-screen virtual keyboard.

Apple already offers slim flatscreens in its iMac range: Tech insiders widely expect an Apple TV by the end of 2012 - and Best Buy's details tally with several previous rumours

Apple is widely rumoured to be introducing such a device this year.

The details tally broadly with details leaked from a survey from U.S retailer 
Best Buy - asking customers what they might 
think of an 'all-new Apple HDTV'.

The
Best Buy survey sparked interest because it was remarkably specific 
about details - namely that the device would be a 42-inch 1080p 
television, would run Angry Birds and other iPhone-style apps, and would
cost $1499

talk to it like a normal person - the ideal way to change channel and 
adjust the volume on Apple's new TV?

The survey, sent out by Norwegian survey 
firm Confirmit, polled customers on what they would think of an upcoming
Apple hi-def television.

The survey also claimed that the television would offer remote-control via iPad and iPhone, as well as web TV such as Netflix.

The slogan is supposedly, 'Apple finally reinvents what a TV can do.'

Less convincingly, the survey also suggested that it would include an iSight camera - a brand Apple no longer uses - and offer Skype, unlikely given that Apple has its own rival, Facetime.

The Verge, which found and confirmed the survey, said, 'Is Best Buy speaking with knowledge, or is it just riffing to get a sense of customer interest in a purely theoretical Apple television? Our guess is that it's nothing more than a shot on the dark.'

The fact that Apple is working on a hi-def television now looks near-certain.

Leaks from Apple's manufacturing 
chain say that Apple has been working on prototype sets since September -
according to a design blueprint laid down by late CEO Steve Jobs.

His 'eureka' moment was realising that Siri's voice control could be used to 'talk' to the set. 'I finally cracked it,' said Jobs.

Jobs
was referring to the realisation that the television should be 
voice-controlled - using the natural-language algorithms of Siri so that
people talk to the set as they would to someone sitting next to them on
the sofa.

Mr Jobs, who died in October, told author Walter Isaacson: 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine.'

Apple
executive Jeff Robbin, who was behind the iPod and iTunes Store, is 
reportedly 'now guiding Apple's internal development of the new TV 
effort'.

It's not the first 
attempt to bring more 'natural' controls to televisions - companies such
as One For All already make gesture-controlled remotes which you simply
'wag' at the screen, and Microsoft's Xbox Kinect camera can be 
controlled by voice.

TV companies such as LG have brought out rival devices in the wake of rumours about Apple TV.

LG's 'Magic' remote will be motion controlled and voice controlled.

The new 'Magic' voice remote will let users speak to control their televisions - a microphone and voice-recognition software built into the remote make your voice work like an internet search

'The
new Magic Remote will make it easier for users to approach LG TVs - 
particularly our Smart TV function which now has over 1,000 apps,' said 
Havis Kwon, president of LG Electronics.

But the highly sophisticated Siri software could represent a huge leap forward for the technology.

A
third party analysis suggests the device will hit shelves by late next 
year or 2013, based on research of Apple's patent portfolio, its 
investments in manufacturing facilities and 'securing supplies of LCD 
screens'.
