Roy Hodgson will give Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain time to prove his World Cup fitness.

Oxlade-Chamberlain will be out for two weeks after scans showed the knee injury suffered against Ecuador on Wednesday was not as bad as first feared.

He has a slight strain in the medial ligaments in his right knee, but no tear was visible and the 20-year-old Arsenal midfielder was able to move around freely in Miami on Thursday with the help of a brace to support the joint.

Awkward: Ecuador midfielder Carlos Gruezo landed awkwardly on the knee of the midfielder

‘Gutted to have picked up an injury,’ 
said Oxlade-Chamberlain on Twitter. ‘I’m staying positive and getting to
 work with the medical team on recovery. Fingers crossed.’

The
 upbeat medical bulletin chased some gloom from the England camp but 
Hodgson is still left with a tricky decision about a player who has been
 ravaged by injuries during the last 12 months. The England boss is fond
 of Oxlade-Chamberlain’s pace and unpredictability.

He
 would like to keep him in the squad and can wait, because he has until 
next Friday to make a decision. The squad fly to Brazil following 
tomorrow’s friendly against Honduras.

They are likely to take a second scan before then to assess the recovery rate. Hodgson must decide whether to take another gamble on the fitness of a player who suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the season and was niggled by a groin injury at the end. The game against Ecuador in Miami was his first start for almost two months.

Blow: Oxlade-Chamberlain looks distraught after suffering an injury against Ecuador

Hodgson may opt to take Oxlade-Chamberlain to Brazil and delay his final verdict. The squad lists were lodged this week but each team is allowed to make a change for a new injury, up to 24 hours before their first game as long as FIFA doctors confirm it is a tournament-ending injury.

Last night Hodgson said: ‘We will do everything we can to keep him with us because a) we would like to think we might go beyond the group stage, and b) he  played so well against Ecuador. He was undoubtedly our best player and it would be a major blow if we lost him.

‘We will do everything in our power to keep him and our medical team are optimistic, he is optimistic, so let’s wait and see.’
