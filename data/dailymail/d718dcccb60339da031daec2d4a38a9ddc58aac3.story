Attack: Headmistress Gillian Kay, pictured arriving to give evidence at Manchester Crown Court, was left with 3cm deep wounds to her head and neck

A primary school head teacher lay on her driveway screaming and pleading for her life after she was stabbed by her paranoid schizophrenic next-door neighbour, a court heard.

Mark Pierson allegedly shouted 'I’m going to kill you you f***ing b****’ before stabbing Gillian Kay in the head and neck with a 4in screwdriver.

The frenzied attack was only interrupted when a passing motorist spotted what was happening and intervened, jurors heard.

Pierson, 48, then 'calmly walked off' into his parents' house.

He had known the headmistress for 10 years and in his pocket was a piece of paper saying 'Gna kill u k', the court heard.

He was quickly arrested - telling police he had suffered 'ten years of abuse' and had three plastic bag full of thousands of documents to prove it.

Bruised and bloodied, 39-year-old Mrs Kay was airlifted to hospital where she survived, despite suffering a 3cm deep cut to the side of her head and and another to the lower back of her skull, which had hair pushed into the wound.

Today she returned to give evidence against her neighbour from behind a screen at Manchester Crown Court.

Mrs Kay, who lives with her husband Martin and daughter Lauren in Royton, Greater Manchester, said the attack happened in April last year as she returned from work at Propps Hall primary school in nearby Oldham.

She said: 'I got home at about 5pm and there was nobody around when I pulled on to the drive.

'I went round to the boot to get my laptop and noticed someone standing next to me, then I realised it was Mark Pierson. I didn’t have a chance to say anything to him.

Frenzied: The scene outside Gillian Kay's house in Royton, Greater Manchester, after she was attacked

'He was less than a metre away from me. I just saw him staring at me and before I had a chance and before I had a chance to say anything he went into his jacket and pulled out a screwdriver.

'I was so petrified. As soon as he pulled it out he started attacking me with it. I didn’t say anything and he was saying "I’m going to kill you, you f***ing b****."

'He had a really contorted face. He looked really angry. He was aiming at my face. The only way I can describe it is frenzied. It was really quick with no pauses in between.

'I felt the blows go into my head. He was using a lot of force because he had pulled on my jacket to pull me to him so I was close to him. The force pushed me on the floor so I was on my back. I was trying to fight him off.'

Mrs Kay's next-door neighbour Mark Pierson was ruled unfit to plead to any criminal charges due to mental illness

She screamed but the attack continued, she said. 'I remember kicking him to try and put space between us but my body twisted and then he got the back of my head,' she said. 'I continued screaming all the way through. He was saying ‘I want to get you, you b****’.

'It felt like it was going on forever. I was screaming and screaming and finding it hard to keep him off me. I remember thinking "this is it", then a white van pulled into the side of the road.

'Then he got off me and dropped the screwdriver and went towards his house. The neighbours were now around and then my husband. Heather [neighbour] was holding my head and trying to stop the blood.'

Survived: Gillian Kay gave evidence from behind a screen against her alleged attacker

Pierson was ruled unfit to plead or stand trial due to his 'paranoid persecutory delusions'.

Therefore he is not charged with a criminal offence - a jury must instead look at the evidence and decide if Pierson committed the attack or not.

If they find he attacked Mrs Kay, he will most likely have a hospital order imposed on him.

Mr Kay had known Pierson for 10 years and grew familiar with him through his parents, the court heard, though there had been 'some issues' between them.

During her evidence, Pierson was heard to shout to Mrs Kay: 'I wanted you in court, I didn’t want you dead.' He also interrupted proceedings with shouts of 'perjury, perjury' while Mrs Kay spoke from behind a screen.

Prosecutor Charlotte Crangle said that when police arrested Pierson, he claimed he had been harassed for ten years and pointed towards plastic bags that contained essential evidence.

'In the bags were thousands of pages of documents written by Pierson. He was put in the van and searched. He had another screwdriver in the lining of his coat. The other screwdriver was spotted close to Mrs Kay with blood stains on.

'There was some blood from Mrs Kay on the defendant’s jeans and a small bit of paper was found in his jeans pocket which refers to killing someone. It said "Gna kill u k".

'In this ferocious and frightening attack, the threats that he was going to kill her and the paper in his pocket, coupled with where the blows were aimed at can only lead to one conclusion and that is you can have no doubt that he was trying to kill Gillian Kay on that day.'

The hearing continues.
