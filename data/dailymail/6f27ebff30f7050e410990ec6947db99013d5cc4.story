Admission: Asked if his wife Alison (left) had ever shopped at Waitrose, Sir Terry Leahy (right) said: 'Occasionally, but I would complain so much that she wouldn't bother'

The former boss of Tesco revealed yesterday his loyalty to the supermarket giant reached such a high level that he tried to ban his wife from shopping at rivals such as Waitrose.

Sir Terry Leahy, who stepped down last year after turning the company into Britain’s biggest and richest retailer, revealed he would deliver a ‘severe telling off’ every time he found products from the rival store in the family’s fridge.

The 56-year-old even bribed his children to inform on their mother, a doctor in the NHS, if she ever shopped at the rival chain.

Asked if his wife Alison had ever shopped at Waitrose, the Liverpool-born businessman said: 'Occasionally, but I would complain so much that she wouldn’t bother'.

He added: 'I actually bribed my children to sort of inform on Alison if ever she popped into Waitrose when she picked up the kids from school.’

Sir Terry and his wife, who have three children, live in Cuffley, Hertfordshire, which is close to the Tesco headquarters. The nearest Waitrose is less than six miles away in Enfield, north London.

Waitrose has made an aggressive attempt to attract Tesco shoppers in recent years with a scheme promising to match its prices on big brand products.

Meanwhile he described the decline of high streets - with thousands of closed and empty shops - as ‘part of progress’. Sir Terry said it was a natural result of families choosing to use supermarkets.

Historic no more: Sir Terry has suggested that high streets are no longer fit for modern families whose shopping habits have evolved as families were choosing to use supermarkets

The retail guru, who has advised 
successive prime ministers, suggested some high streets have effectively
become irrelevant, historic relics.

However, critics suggest the change in
character of Britain, with the emergence ‘ghost towns’, also has a 
great deal to do with Tesco’s financial and political muscle.

In some cases it has used its enormous
financial and legal resources to push through planning applications for
new stores regardless of the views of local people and councils.

Such is its dominance, that it has 
effectively taken over many areas, claiming more than 50per cent of all 
grocery sales in so-called ‘Tesco Towns’.

While the giant, with profits of more 
than £3billion a year, has also created a vast land bank, wrapped in 
legal covenants, that has prevented rivals from opening competing 
outlets nearby.

The big supermarkets have also used 
staple products like bread and milk as loss leaders to attract customers
away from small rivals.

Sir Terry was speaking on Radio 4’s 
Desert Island Discs yesterday, where he insisted shoppers, rather 
than supermarkets, were responsible for the changes seen in towns.

Dominance: Critics suggest Tesco's political and financial muscle can be blamed for the emergence of 'ghost towns' where independent retailers used to thrive

Asked by Kirsty Young whether seeing 
boarded-up shops made him sad, Sir Terry said: ‘It does but it is part 
of progress. People are not made to shop in supermarkets, they choose to
shop there.

‘High streets - some of them are 
medieval and the way that we live our lives now is very different, so 
what you have to do is make sure the benefits do outweigh the costs, and
I think that they do.’

The Association of Convenience Stores has fought to protect independent small stores – often unsuccessfully.

'I actually bribed my children to sort of inform on my wife Alison if ever she popped into Waitrose when she picked up the kids from school'

Sir Terry Leahy

Its chief executive, James Lowman, said: ‘Modern high streets are vital to the future of retail.

‘Few would agree that the Tesco towns that emerged under Leahy’s tenure constitute progress.

‘People still value their local shops and town centres, and government needs to do more to support these businesses.’

During the programme, Sir Terry also 
revealed an unlikely connection with punk rockers UK Subs - telling how 
he lived in a flat above theirs and once kept them awake by listening to
his radio too loudly.

He said: ‘I came down to London round 
about 1980 and it was just at the time of punk music and new wave music,
and I got an attic flat in London above a punk rock band called the UK 
Subs.

‘They used to play their music every 
day to four in the morning and I would be rocked to sleep by the UK 
Subs, and then I was up one morning with the Today Programme on my 
transistor radio and there was a bang on the door and it was a man in a 
leopard skin leotard and he said ‘Will you turn that radio down? I’m 
trying to get some sleep’.’
