Leading British actress Emma Thompson has slammed Tony Abbott for failing to act on climate change while travelling through the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign.

The Golden Globe and Oscar award winner appeared in a photograph on a Greenpeace ship near the Smeerenburg glacier, holding a sign which read: 'Tony Abbott climate change is REAL I'm standing on it!'

A second photograph featuring the 55-year-old, saw her holding a second sign with the words: 'Where I stand should be ice'.

The author and screenwriter is currently travelling around the area on Greenpeace's ship Esperanza with a larger group of people which includes her 14-year-old daughter Gaia Romilly Wise.

The team of people are visiting retreating glaciers in the area in the hope of drawing attention to the impacts of climate change, according to Greenpeace's program director Ben Pearson.

'We're told that it is all our fault, global warming — we want the fuel, we want our cars, and that the oil industry is merely responding to the needs of a greedy public,' Ms Thompson said.

'But that's simply not fair. Most of us want to live cleaner lives, but our governments don't make these things easily available.

Mr Abbott was not the only world leader that Ms Thompson and the other public figures were calling to action, with Mr Putin and Mr Obama also being asked to help preserve the Arctic

Ms Thompson said from the ship: 'We need governments to stand up to the dirty industries that have for so long funded and controlled them'

Celebrities and friends of Ms Thompson including Tom Hanks, Russell Crow, Gwyneth Paltrow and Steven Fry, have all expressed their support for the actress and the campaign over Twitter

'The changes we need, that the Arctic needs, must come from the top as well as the bottom. We need electric cars to be cheaper and more accessible. We want safer bike lanes in every big city. We want plastic bags to be banned for good.

'We need governments to stand up to the dirty industries that have for so long funded and controlled them, and to give us all an affordable chance to live our lives in a more sustainable way.'

Celebrities and friends of Ms Thompson including Tom Hanks, Russell Crow, Gwyneth Paltrow and Steven Fry, have all expressed their support for the actress and the campaign over Twitter.

Mr Pearson told Daily Mail Australia that the sign was most likely a joint idea between Ms Thompson and the Greenpeace crew.

The 55-year-old (pictured here with her daughter standing) also implored people concerned with climate change to pressure their governments to take action

Greenpeace's project director, Ben Pearson, told Daily Mail Australia that the sign was most likely a joint idea between Ms Thompson and the Greenpeace crew

'Tony Abbott is leading a government which is the first in the world to actually repeal a carbon price and that's outrageous. We are already seeing the impact of climate change and the dismantling of climate change laws is completely unjustifiable,' Mr Pearson said.

'Emma is expressing the outrage that many people feel about that.'

Ms Thompson also called for people concerned about climate change to rally and write to their local leaders 'demanding action'.

'Tony Abbott is leading a government which is the first in the world to actually repeal a carbon price... Emma is expressing the outrage that many people feel about that,' Mr Pearson said

'Yes, keep recycling; keep using your own shopping bags, taking transit and using your bike. But also use your voice. Know that you have power and you can make your government listen,' she said.

'Above all, I hope that people stop feeling so guilty and powerless about climate change. That's the lie that keeps us paralyzed when really together, we are so much more powerful.'

Greenpeace's campaign, which hopes to ban oil drilling and industrial fishing in the Arctic, has attracted more than five million supporters in the last two years.

The organisation is also calling for a protected sanctuary to be established in the North Pole.
