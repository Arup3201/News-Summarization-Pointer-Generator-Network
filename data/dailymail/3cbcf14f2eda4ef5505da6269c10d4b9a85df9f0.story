With prices for limes as high as $1.50 this year because of a lime shortage in the U.S., margarita, gin & tonic drinkers and even guacamole lovers will be relieved to hear that prices are on their way back down.

America's limes are imported almost exclusively from Mexico, and whilst the demand never ceased, they became increasingly hard to come by with some bars and restaurants resorting to lemons or simply forgoing the citrus fruit altogether.

40-pound boxes of limes which were commanding $35 are now closer to $6 a box. Now that the price is dropping once again, Mexican farmers couldn't be happier.

Reduced: A shortage in Mexico, where 97 per cent of the U.S.'s  limes are produced caused prices to skyrocket.  At one stage prices for a single lime were as much as $1.50 but last week they were closer to 30 cents

Lime crime: The Knights Templar drug cartel in Michoacan, Mexico has been raiding lime groves and hijacking farmer's trucks. Above, vigilantes have organized to fight the cartel

Last week the U.S. Department of Agriculture said consumers paid on average 30 cents a lime, compared with 90 a few months ago.

Some, like Mexican chains like Rosa Mexicano decided to take the hit hoping the shortage would pass.

'I
 can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $36 a 
case,' manager Jay Holmes said. 'At one stage, the cases were costing us
 $110 a case.'

Across the border, in
 the outdoor wholesale lime market in Apatzingan, Michoacan in Mexico, 
dozens stand in line waiting for the pick-up trucks to pull up with the 
fruit which is known is green gold.

Alternatives: The shortage caused some restaurants and bars to charge more for lime-based drinks, or substitute with lemons. Above limes are sorted in Mihoacan, Mexico last November

'The trucks barely stop and the limes are sold ... they're selling like hotcakes,' Geraldo Fernandez, a lime buyer told NPR.

Mexico's lime-producing states like Veracruz took a beating after bad weather and a fungal outbreak earlier this year.

However the orchards in Michoacan ended up making record profits.

Recent improved weather and a decent spring crop means supplies are almost back to normal.

The farmers of Michoacan aren't complaining about the price drop as they are still enjoying their record profits.

A weight appears to have been lifted because they are no longer at the mercy of Mexico's ruthless drug cartels.

For
 more than a decade, at one stage every part of the lime business was 
controlled by one drug gang or another. The last few seasons have been 
controlled by the Knights Templar cartel.

Lime farmers reported that 
cartel members would raid their groves and hijack delivery trucks.

Many growers refused to even send their trucks on the road.

Winners and losers: One man has took advantage of the shortage by driving a U-Haul truck to and from Florida and selling limes at New York restaurants and bars. Above a man unloads a truck-load full of Mexican limes at a packing plant in Michoacan

'You'd make the money and they would take it, they charged so-called taxes, quotas on everything,' says Efrain Hernandez.

The
 drug gang would made specific demands on the farmers telling them where
 and when they could sell their crops and even at what price.

They cartel would then take 10 per cent of the profits which would be as much as $2,000 a week.

Now, the federal police have begun a crackdown in the state. Several top leaders of the cartel have been killed or arrested.

Three mayors and a former governor of Michoacan were arrested on charges of colluding with organized crime.

But
 now everything appears to be green and the farmers are once again enjoying the fruits of 
their labor as they swap their 'green gold' for greenbacks from 
across the border.
