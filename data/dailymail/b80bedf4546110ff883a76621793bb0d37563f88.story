Liverpool's crunch Premier League clash against Manchester United on Sunday is gearing up to be a pivotal one in the race for the top four.

The match will also be a poignant one for Reds skipper Steven Gerrard too - in what will be his last-ever against Manchester United before his move to MLS side LA Galaxy at the end of the season.

Here Sportsmail looks back on the 34-year-old's career against the Red Devils.
