French actor Gerard Depardieu has been granted Russian citizenship after a very public war with the leaders of his country over high taxes on the rich.

A brief announcement on the Kremlin website said president Vladimir Putin had signed the citizenship grant today.

Depardieu is furious at French president Francois Hollande's attempt to raise taxes on the mega-rich to 75 per cent. Russia has a flat income tax of 13 per cent.

Angry: The French actor, pictured with Putin in St Petersburg in 2010, has been locked in a very public battle with his country over the tax hike

A representative for Depardieu declined to say whether he had accepted the offer, which, although genuine, is widely seen as a Russian swipe at France rather than a genuine act of concern for the multi-millionaire actor's finances.

Depardieu has made more than 150 films, 
including 1991 comedy Green Card, about a man who enters into a marriage
 of convenience in order to get U.S. residency.

The actor was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Cyrano de Bergerac in the 1990 film by the same name. He also appeared in an adaption of the Belgian classic Asterix and Obelix.

Depardieu said in an open letter published in mid-December that he had been 'insulted' by
 France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, and planned to turn over his passport and French social security card.

Ayrault called him pathetic for wanting
 to leave France for tax-friendly Belgium to avoid the new top rate.

In an angry letter, published in Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Depardieu wrote: 'I was born in 1948. I started working aged 14, as a printer, as a warehouseman, then as an actor, and I’ve always paid my taxes.'

Over 45 years, Depardieu said, he had paid €145million euros in tax, and to this day employs 80 people. Last year he paid taxes amounting to 85 per cent of his income.

'I
 am neither worthy of pity nor admirable, but I shall not be called "pathetic",' he concluded.

'I'm a true European, a citizen of the world.'

As a clear statement of intent, Mr Depardieu, has put his luxury house on Paris’s Left Bank up for 
sale for an estimated €50m.

British tax expert Richard Murphy who runs Tax Research UK
 said: 'Mr Depardieu has claimed to be one of France's great patriots yet
 he runs off to Belgium to avoid French taxes, showing little respect 
for the country's "liberté, égalité, fraternité" motto.'

'Citizen of the world': Depardieu has sold his home in Paris and reportedly bought one in Nechin, Belgium

Belgium's top rate, like the UK, is capped at 50 per cent, although Britain's will return to 45 per cent as of April 2013.

The tax on millionaires was struck down by France's highest court on December 29, but the government intends to resubmit the law in a slightly different form soon.

Depardieu is well known in Russia, where he appears in an ad for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is prominently featured on the bank's home page.

France's Civil Code says one must have another nationality in order to give up French citizenship because it is forbidden to be stateless. Today's decision by the Kremlin would appear to fulfil that requirement.

The helmet... and the gloves are off: Depardieu responded angrily to claims by the French Prime Minister that he was pathetic for running away to avoid tax

The Belgian Foreign Minister has 
given carte blanche to anyone planning to follow in Depardieu's 
footsteps and move to Belgium in an attempt to escape higher French 
taxes.

'If other French people want to come to Belgium, I'm not at all opposed,' said Didier Reynders in an interview with Le Figaro.

He
 emphasised that France shouldn't be blaming Belgium if some residents, 
one of the leading lights of national cinema among them, are leaving the
 country.

'…It is totally fallacious to believe
 that we Belgians would do everything to attract the French. No! It 
turns out that for years, France has freely chosen a tax system that 
carries consequences and led the French to leave the country,' he added.

Au revoir: France's Civil Code says one must have another nationality in order to give up French citizenship because it is forbidden to be stateless. Thursday's decision by the Kremlin appears to fulfill that requirement

Reports say Depardieu had acquired property in the Belgium village of Nechin.

Le Soir 
newspaper said that his new neighbours could include the Mulliez 
family, a billionaire clan that owns the giant French retail chain 
Auchan.

Up to 27 per cent of Nechin’s 
inhabitants are French, according to France's Le Point magazine.

Bernard Arnault – 
France's richest man – applied for Belgian citizenship after the 
Government proposed the 75 per cent tax rate.
