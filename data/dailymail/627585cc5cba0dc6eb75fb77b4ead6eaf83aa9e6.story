The year Queen Victoria celebrated 60 years on the throne - the first British monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee - the world's first wedding car was built.

This vintage 1897 Daimler Wagonette is believed to be the world’s first wedding transport after a black and white photograph of the car during a 1903 wedding ceremony has been uncovered.

The Haynes Motor Museum in Yeovil, Somerset has swept the cobwebs off this stunning British-built classic and now allows newlyweds to recreate the vintage look by having their wedding photos onboard the historic car.

World's first wedding car: This photograph taken of the 1903 wedding of James Andrews and Rosa Gough suggests that this is the first example of cars being used as wedding transport

The 1897 British-built Daimler Wagonette, with a top speed of just 11mph,  dates back to the first days of motoring when cars were better known as ‘horseless carriages’.

Its basic two-cylinder petrol engine only generates 6.5 horsepower but in its day it was at the forefront of technology.

It did however have a tendency to backfire, which earned it the nickname ‘Fiery Liz’.

The car boasted all the mod cons of 
the time - a ‘handbrake’ that comprising of a metal rod that digs into 
the ground and cart wheels with solid rubber tyres.

Trendsetter: The car cost £373 new, equivalent to £42,000 today, and was nicknamed 'Fiery Liz' for its tendency to backfire

It even has leather mud flaps and brakes that are rubber blocks that grip the tyres.

But it came at a price – the car cost £373 new, equivalent to £42,000 today.

The museum received the car as a donation from the Bristol Museum, prompting curious staff to delve into its history.

Research
revealed the car was the centre of attention at the wedding of Mr James
Andrews and Miss Rosa Gough in Weston-Super-Mare in 1903.

Mike
Penn, the museum’s curatorial director, said: ‘When the car first 
arrived we knew that it was one of the very first motor cars to be used 
in Somerset and that it had previously been owned by a Mr J H Pruen from
Burnham-on-Sea.

‘Further research uncovered a photograph showing the car had been used for a wedding between a Mr James Andrews from Bristol and Miss Rosa Gough from Weston-Super-Mare.

‘We were keen to track down a copy of the original photograph and to get some more details about the couple so we scoured local records offices and census information.

‘Initial suggestions that the marriage took place in 1898 were eventually discounted and a wider search revealed the wedding actually took place five years later and the couple emigrated to New Zealand soon afterwards.

‘Contact was then made with a surviving relative in New Zealand who was able to provide a copy of the original wedding photograph.

‘We believe it to depict the first documented use of the wedding car.’

The same year as ‘Fiery Liz’ appeared in the wedding snaps driving licences were introduced costing five shillings (25p) from the Post Office.

Registration plates were also introduced in 1903, costing one pound, and the speed limit was raised to 20mph with heavy fines for speeding and reckless driving.

Licence and registration please: The car's registration plates are one of the first in Britain. In 1903, registration plates were introduced, costing £1, as were driving licences which could be bought from the Post Office for five shillings (25p)
