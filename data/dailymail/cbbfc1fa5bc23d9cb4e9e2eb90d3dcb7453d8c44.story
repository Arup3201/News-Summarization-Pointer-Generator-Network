The European and American Ryder Cup rivals were joined by their WAGs on Wednesday night as the build-up to the weekend showdown continued with a Gala Dinner in Glasgow.

Players and their partners posed for pictures at the Gleneagles hotel before making the one-hour trip to Scotland's biggest city for the evening.

A concert at the SSE Hydro was the night's main event with Chic legend Nile Rodgers the headline act.
