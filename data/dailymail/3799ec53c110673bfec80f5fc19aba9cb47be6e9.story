Car buyers are being forced to pay extra if they want the vehicle in a colour that the manufacturer says is beyond the norm, an investigation has found.

It can cost buyers hundreds of pounds for basic colours. Even white now costs extra as it overtakes metallic tints in the popularity stakes.

Experts fear motorists are becoming victims of ‘fifty shades of rip-off’.

Pricey: This Seat Alhambra would cost you extra as it is not in the standard Salsa Red, according to Auto Express

An investigation by Auto Express magazine reveals that most mainstream brands now offer only one ‘flat’ or basic colour free of charge.

And in most instances, customers will have to ‘upgrade’ to get greater choice - which pushes the price of the paint job beyond £500 for the majority of makers.

The report says Spanish car maker SEAT - part of the giant Volkswagen Group - only sells a new Alhambra in Salsa Red at no extra cost.

It notes: ‘However, if you want white paint, you’ll have to shell out £175. Prefer Deep Black metallic? The price rises to £500. Go a step further to the bronze-like Boal, and you’ll pay £635.’

'Norm': This white Citroen DS3 comes at no extra cost, but any other colour commands a premium

Explaining why drivers are being forced to stump up more for a colour other than a flat red, a SEAT spokesman told the magazine: ‘The trend for white paint over the past five years has had the effect of diminishing the take-up of metallic over the same period.

'Obviously, paint is something we as a manufacturer have to purchase. And with fewer buyers choosing metallic as a cost option, we have to plug the financial gap by charging a nominal fee for certain ‘flat’ paints.'

The Nissan Juke has only white as a ‘no-cost’ paint.

The Auto Express investigation found that car makers charge the following range of prices for a non-standard paint job, depending on the exact colour and finish:

Audi: £340 to £715

Citroen: £450 to £600

Fiat: £300 to £460

Ford: £495 
to £545

Honda: £450 to £500

Hyundai: £435 to £495

Jaguar: £650 to £790

Land Rover: £550 to £800

Mercedes-Benz: £570 to £645

MINI: £450 to £720

Nissan: £450 to £550

Peugeot: £450 to £550

Porsche: £558 to £801

Renault:
£495

Toyota: £450 to £700

Volkswagen: £460 to £595.

The magazine says: ’Any other colour is offered as metallic only, and carries a £500 price tag.

Similarly the Citroen DS3 has a flat white colour as the sole no-cost option.

Nor does the cost to the customer of these flat paint finishes vary according to the size of the car.

SEAT’s non-metallic white costs the same £175 on smaller models like the Mii city car as it does on the much larger Alhambra seven-seater.

At the super-luxury end of the market, Bentley customers can pay up to £20,000 for their preferred satin finish and colour on a Continental GT Coupé or Convertible. It’s a similar tale with Ferrari for its historical tints such as Azzurru California, and Rosso Dino.

Auto Express editor in chief Steve Fowler said: ‘Never mind Fifty Shades of Grey. One has to wonder whether motorists are victims of fifty shades of rip-off when it comes to a car’s paint job. ‘

Paint specialist Paul Normyle who runs ‘Shine smart repair told Auto Express that several factors were to blame including an EU directive in 2006-07 that all paints must be water-based rather than oil-based adding to research and development costs.

He said: ’This, of course, has a knock-on effect - and somebody has to pay for it.’

Improved paint quality also comes at a price: ‘Look at a red car from 10 years ago, and it’ll be pink because of oxidisation from the sun. That no longer happens.’

And the fashion for greater personalisation is giving car-makers some extra margin: ‘About 30 to 40 per cent of the paint price is the genuine cost. The rest is what you have to pay for the ability to personalise your car.’
