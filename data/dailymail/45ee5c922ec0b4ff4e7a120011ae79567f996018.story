Broadcaster: Joan Bakewell, 81, says she suffers from memory lapses and has become concerned it is not 'simple forgetfulness'

Joan Bakewell yesterday revealed her fear of being diagnosed with dementia.

The broadcaster says she suffers from memory lapses and has become concerned it is not ‘simple forgetfulness’.

The 81-year-old now has to rely on prompts such as sticky notes and to-do lists. In a programme called Suppose I Lose It, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 yesterday, Lady Bakewell discussed the issue with Prunella Scales.

The 82-year-old Fawlty Towers star has been forced to give up stage performances because of her advancing dementia. She and her actor husband Timothy West manage her condition with the support of a live-in helper.

In the BBC‘s online magazine yesterday, Lady Bakewell wrote of her friend’s predicament: ‘The fact is dementia is changing her and their lives together but, as in the best of marriages, it is a shift rather than a catastrophe.

‘Tim clearly feels the loss – when they go out for the evening together they both enjoy the event, but once back home Pru can’t talk about it because it has already slipped from her memory.'

Lady Bakewell also reflected on how friends are ‘drifting into this unknown world’ and considered the future of a nation that already has more than 800,000 dementia sufferers. 

She added: ‘What I’ve been learning about early intervention, the memory clinics, the ongoing research, is enough to persuade me that staying alert for symptoms and confronting fears early is the best way to grow old. I know I shall be taking those memory tests one day soon.

'There will always be a struggle for resources and new skills. If individuals can help with their own diagnoses, rather than hide away from bad news, then that will help.’

The former Heart of the Matter presenter concludes that her own needs have not changed greatly.

She said: ‘Nonetheless it is evident enough for me to take small avoiding steps – sticky notes left around the house, a notepad beside the bed, a list of things to do each day.

‘But then didn’t I do that already when the overload of my busy life threatened to engulf me? 

'I have been a journalist for over 40 years, working in different media and keeping tabs on what I do through well-ordered and sometime scruffy diaries, shelves of files and dependence on the support of agents and editors.

‘The agents and editors might well say their support has got stronger in recent months. I happily take for granted their loyalty and friendship. 

'A network of obligations that keeps me busy and committed is keeping me on track. If dementia looms, I simply haven’t time to notice.’

Memory problems could be a stroke warning in highly educated people, a study has found.

Researchers from the Erasmus University, Rotterdam, discovered that people with a university degree who struggle with memory loss are 39 per cent more likely to have a stroke.

Experts believe the reason is that such people have fitter brains, with greater ‘cognitive reserve’. This reserve acts as a buffer if they are affected by brain diseases.

As a result decreases in cognitive function, such as memory loss, could be a sign that their resilience has decreased significantly – indicating a greater likelihood of a stroke.
