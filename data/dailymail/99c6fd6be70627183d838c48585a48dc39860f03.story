Southampton have had a £4.5million bid rejected for Leeds United right-back Sam Byram.

Manager Ronald Koeman wants Byram to replace the departed Calum Chambers.

Southampton have also made a bid for Steaua Bucharest defender Florian Gardos and made an enquiry for Leicester defender Wes Morgan.

A deal for Sporting Lisbon's Marcos Rojo is complicated by a third party ownership which is inflating the price.

No deal: Leeds have rejected Southampton's £4.5m bid for defender Sam Byram

Collapsed: Leed's loan move for Juventus defender Frederik Sorensen has fallen through

Meanwhile, Leeds United's proposed loan for Frederik Sorensen has collapsed.

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino claimed the signing was sealed on Wednesday afternoon, saying Leeds would pay a loan fee of around £400,000 and a further £3m in 12 months’ time, but problems developed after talks with Sorensen’s agent on Thursday. 

The Juventus defender is now poised to join Verona.
