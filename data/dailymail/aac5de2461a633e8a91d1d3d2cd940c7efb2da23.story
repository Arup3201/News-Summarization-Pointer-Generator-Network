He may have been just another one of the thousands screaming from the stands as England thrashed Peru three goals to nil.

But Prince William couldn't resist making a trip down to the Wembley dressing room at full time to pass on his personal congratulations.

Greeting the exhausted and towel-clad victors, the Duke also wished them luck for the fast-approaching World Cup.

William, who is president of the Football Association (FA), spent time with each player in the 23-man squad discussing the match and what's in store for Rio.

They have just two more warm up matches to go - against Ecuador and Honduras in Miami - before the tournament begins.

After sailing past Peru - with no injuries - spirits in the dressing room were high.

William has been keenly following the squad's preparations, which Jack Wilshere (seated) described to him

Pep talk: William, president of the FA, passed on his best to Jordan Henderson for their next two friendlies

The prince caught with goal-scorers Daniel Sturridge and Gary Cahill mid-undressing for a quick chat about the confidence boost they've given the side.

He also joked with Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard, and the squad's captain Steven Gerrard before they had a debrief with manager Roy Hodgson.

Hodgson is doing his best to downplay any excitement surrounding England's hopes in Rio.

But he said it was 'really nice to see' William dropping down to give them a boost.

He said: 'He is an enormous supporter of the Football Association and the England team.

'I was happy that he came into a happy dressing room. It was really nice to see him. He had a long chat with the players and wished us all the best for Brazil.'
