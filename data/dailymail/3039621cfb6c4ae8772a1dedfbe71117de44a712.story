An Australian ship 
has taken over the efforts to save a tourist ship submerged in Antarctic
 ice since Christmas Day after a top-of-the-range Chinese icebreaker got
 stuck en-route.

The Xue
 Long, or Snow Dragon, was six nautical miles away from the stranded 
Russian ship when it too became trapped before eventually turning back 
to open water.

But there are fears even the second boat will not be able to break through the four-metre-thick ice packs.

Trapped: 74 people, including scientists, tourists and a Guardian reporter, are stuck in thick ice sheets

The stranded Academic Shokalskiy, 
carrying 74 people, was recreating a 100-year-old Australasia expedition
 first sailed by Sir Douglas Mawson to see how the journey changes using
 new technology and equipment.

But on Wednesday morning, the boat hit a mass of thick ice sheets and today remains at a stand still.

Now,
 Australia's Aurora Australis, a back up ship carrying extra food and 
supplies, has been forced to take on the mission breaking through snow 
and ice in the Commonwealth Bay, eastern Antarctica.

It hopes to arrive on Sunday.

The
 captain of the Aurora, Murray Doyle, said his ship - which can cut 
through ice up to 1.35 metres thick or reverse and ram thicker ice to 
break it up - was always 'option B'.

'We were always going to be sent on until the end,' he told a Sydney Morning Herald reporter onboard his ship.

However, he admitted the ship was not built to take on ice thicker than three metres.

He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'.

Just before 5am on Wednesday, Australia deployed a The Snow Dragon to free the group into open water, the BBC reported, but Capt. Wang Jiangzhong has now said it may need another two icebreakers to help it get to the stranded ship.

French
 vessel L'Astrolabe has also been sent out for back up, alongside 
Australia's Aurora Australis, which is carrying food and first aid 
professionals.

After two days being stranded, passengers hoped to be rescued by the Snow Dragon as it powered through horrific conditions.

But yesterday the heavy winds became too great, and built up an impenetrable pile of snow.

Academic Shokalskiy, an ice-strengthened ship built in 1982, was originally used for 
oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a 
passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica.

Marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of
 Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania - the thick 
ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind.

The ship had been on a multi-day tour from New Zealand to visit several sites along the edge of Antarctica before getting trapped in sea ice

France's L'Astrobe and Australia's Aurora Australis have also been deployed to save the ship

On
 board are scientists from the University of New
 South Wales, a journalist from The Guardian and dozens of tourists who 
have paid to be part of the recreation of Mawsonâ€™s expedition.

The research team has made contact with local stations from the Commonwealth Bay to say they are well-stocked with food.

'We
 all know that there's a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted
 sit and wait,' said Andrew Peacock, a passenger onboard the Akademik 
Shokalskiy, speaking via satellite phone.

'I think people are just looking at that next step when that second icebreaker arrives.

'We really are just hoping that the two powerful icebreaker ships will provide the breakage of ice that we need.'

However, he said the ice floes appear to have built up dramatically overnight.

They are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets.

A
 spokesman for Australia's Maritime Safety Authority told Australia's 
Associated Press: 'It is quite a remote part of the world, but we have 
everyone safe. The vessel isn't in any immediate danger.'

The spokesman said the ship was visiting a number of sites along the edge of Antarctica.

The nationalities of the tourists have not been revealed, but they are known to include scientists and explorers.

One has managed to send a tweet.

 Turney, of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, wrote: 'Heavy ice. 
Beautiful; light wind. Only -1degC. All well. Merry Xmas everyone from 
AAE.'
