Two men suffered severe burns after a hot air balloon hit a powerline and caught fire before crashing more than 40ft to the ground.

Pilot Mark Kilgore and crew chief Daniel Lovato were taking part in the world's largest annual ballooning event, the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta Flight, when their gondola hit the lines.

Mr Kilgore, 59, was attempting to land the balloon when the gondola hit the power lines during the mass ascension on Wednesday morning.

The event saw more than 550 hot air 
balloons take to the skies in front of thousands of who had flocked to 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the week-long international balloon fiesta.

The accident took place during the opening event, a mass ascension in which the brightly coloured balloons lifted off in waves.

A passenger who tried to free the burning gondola received an electric shock but did not need to be taken to hospital,  Balloon Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity told ABC.

The pilot and crew chief were taken to University of New Mexico Hospital where 66-year-old Mr Lovato was taken into surgery to treat the burns on his face, chest and arms.

He remains in hospital where his condition is listed as 'unknown'. Mr Kilgore has been released.

Fiesta provides a unique environment for female pilots from around the 
world to gather, demonstrate our skills, and encourage the many young 
girls and women we meet to join our sport.

'Without a doubt we are privileged to participate in an event that brings so much joy to this community.'
