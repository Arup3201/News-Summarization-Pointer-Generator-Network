A baby's birthmark which grew into a rare and deadly tumour was treated just days before doctors said it would have gone on to kill her.

Lynda Gibson, of Cumbernauld, Glasgow, first noticed what looked like a harmless, tiny red speck on the left eye of her daughter Georgia when she was just weeks old.

But within a fortnight it had developed into a fast growing tumour behind her optic nerve leaving her eye so swollen her devoted parents were wrongly accused of hitting the youngster.

Doctors later told Mrs Gibson and husband 
Richard that if Georgia's tumour had gone undiagnosed for another ten 
days, it would have been untreatable.

The family's nightmare began when Georgia was just three-weeks-old and Mrs Gibson was feeding her.

The swelling quickly got worse over the next 24 hours so she took her to see the GP the next day.

Medics initially put it down to a burst blood vessel and said it would get worse before it got better.

But Mrs Gibson, 38, said: 'Ten days passed and it looked like a black eye.

'She had red marks up the side of her face that travelled right up to the top of her head. She just looked like she was being battered.'

Normally the birthmark, called a haemangioma, grows on the skin.

But in Gerogia's case it mainly grew internally - something that happens in just one in 100,000 cases - and came close to attaching itself to the brain. 

The condition appeared so bad shoppers in Mrs Gibson's local supermarket took her car registration, concerned that her child was being abused.

A family health visitor even had to step in and advise social services that Georgia had a medical condition and was not at risk of abuse.

'It was a nightmare. It started off as a little red spot on her eye and just got bigger and bigger,' said Mrs Gibson.

'When she took a growth spurt it [the birthmark] got a big growth spurt too, because it feeds off the blood vessels. She just looked like she was being beaten up.

'But thankfully we had a very good health visitor who acted as a buffer and contacted social services to let them know she had a medical condition. We had enough on our plates without that.

'Complete strangers would come up and ask, 'did you hit your baby?, "what's wrong with your baby's face, did you drop her?"

'You expect comments like that from kids but from adults, it was shocking. That's what I found the most hurtful.'

Lynda Gibson, of Cumbernauld, Glasgow, first noticed what looked like a harmless, tiny red speck on daughter Georgia's eye when she was just weeks old. It later turned into a fast-growing tumour

It was only by chance, when Georgia had a routine check-up after suffering from a touch of jaundice, that Mrs Gibson was told her daughter's birth mark had developed into a tumour that was growing rapidly behind her eye. 

The doctor had recognised the signs of the tumour immediately and just hours later, after a series of tests and scans at Yorkhill Children's Hospital, Mrs Gibson and her husband were given the devastating diagnosis.

The disease had left their baby with no peripheral vision and a stigma had formed in her left eye.

The normal course of treatment would previously have been gruelling cancer treatment to shrink the benign growth.

But she became one of the first in Scotland to be put on a trial drug called propranolol, a beta-blocker traditionally used to treat hypertension and heart conditions, which had been shown to shrink haemangiomas.

Georgia was kept in hospital for 24 hours, in which time the drug had drastically reduced the swelling around her eye.

Her parents then fed the drug to her through a syringe every eight hours at home for the next 18 months.

Bouncing back: Georgia Gibson's tumour is expected to have shrunk by 50 per cent by the time she is five and by 90 per cent by the time she is nine

She also endured weekly appointments to see a cardiologist, dermatologist and ophthalmologist, to monitor the effects of the drug.

Georgia has now made a full recovery and like any three-year-old girl, loves going to nursery and dressing up as a princess.

Her tumour is still there, but doctors have said it will continue to shrink naturally and is no longer a threat. 

It is expected to have shrunk by 50 per cent by the time she is five and by 90 per cent by the time she is nine.

Mrs Gibson said: 'Haemangiomas normally grow on the outside [of the body] but in Georgia's case it was mainly internal.

'It was sitting behind her optic nerve and we were told we were about 10 days away from it attaching to her brain.

'We are so fortunate everything worked out and we had Yorkhill right on our doorstep.'  

Mr Gibson, a bus driver, now plans to walk 10 miles in aid of Yorkhill Children's Charity to thank the staff who saved their daughter and to help other children still being treated at the hospital.
