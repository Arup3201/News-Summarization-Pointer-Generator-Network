Success: BBC Newsreader Kate Silverton said the corporation should employ more older women and ethnic minorities

Kate Silverton has urged her television bosses to follow their American counterparts and do more to employ older women and those from ethnic minorities.

The 42-year-old BBC newsreader said: ‘Let’s put it this way, they blooming well should.

‘It’s quite interesting, in America you get reminded how the American networks are very fair. If you are over 40 and are a woman you get pushed quite a bit.

'I don’t want to get too political on the female front but it is down to the producers as it is down to the commissioners who are choosing.

‘I say we should be celebrating all ages, sexes, colours and creeds. We should be doing that.

'All we can do is our bit and we have just got to forge a path and keep forging paths and keep hoping that the commissioners and producers will follow suit.’

Speaking to the same audience at a Royal Television Society event on the subject, Michael Wild, who edits Sunday Politics on BBC1, admitted that the ‘BBC has been very slow off the mark’ in dealing with the matter.

He added: ‘With the BBC it takes a while to steer the big ship around but there is a lot of effort going on at the moment’.

Mr Wild said he knew ‘word had gone out’ to radio stations across the country that it would be unacceptable if main daytime presenters are exclusively male.

Describing her struggle to get to the top of her profession, Miss Silverton revealed it was a friend dying from cancer who persuaded her to give up her well-paid job in corporate finance to follow her dream of a career in journalism.

She said: ‘I went in to see him. I had my big shoulder pads on and big hair and everything and I was very unhappy and he said to me ‘why are you not following your heart and what you want to do in your life? Look at me I don’t have much time left’.

Miss Silverton took a job with the BBC in the north east and worked her way up from making the tea. She also made sandwiches on the side to make extra income.

‘When I started in TV I literally made tea and then politicians came in and I made them tea and slowly I learned about the job. I then got to talk to the Tony Blairs, the Mo Mowlams and then I would go away and learn. Making tea for people makes a hell of a lot of difference when you are starting out. When I walked into a newsroom for the first time I had no experience whatsoever but I knew I was home.’

Miss Silverton is married to former Royal Marine Mike Heron. They met when he was an instructor on a course for BBC journalists going to war zones.

The couple have one daughter Clemency who Miss Silverton has referred to as her ‘little miracle’ as she was told it was unlikely she could conceive naturally and underwent IVF treatment unsuccessfully four times.
