Lord Warner warned yesterday that the NHS is so short on cash it may have to start charging patients, but new figures have reveal it wasted £48million on non-jobs

The NHS is spending £46million a year on non-jobs such as ‘play and communication workers’, ‘carbon managers’ and ‘car park environmental officers’, it has emerged.

There are 1,229 staff in apparently unnecessary roles across the health service – on salaries as high as £90,000, an investigation has found.

They include a part-time ‘arts in hospital co-ordinator’ at Dorset County hospitals on a £30,000 salary and a ‘green label development co-ordinator’ on £24,300 at Mid Cheshire NHS trust.

Barts and the London hospital employs an ‘EU office director’ on £87,500 as well as an ‘energy and carbon manager’ on £35,500.

Overall, the NHS is squandering £34million a year on PR staff, £3.5million on ‘green’ staff and £6.8million on equality and diversity staff.

The revelations came on the day a former Labour minister warned that the health service is so short of cash it should start making patients pay a £10 monthly membership fee.

Lord Warner, who previously advised Tony Blair on health reforms, yesterday also called for patients to be charged £20 a night for staying  in hospital.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which obtained the figures from Freedom of Information requests said: ‘The NHS employs far too many people in jobs that do nothing to deliver frontline patient care.’

The highest paid non-job role is the communications director at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals on £92,300.

Away from front line care the NHS spent £34million on PR and £6.8million on equality and diversity staff

And South London NHS trust – which was put into administration after racking up debts of £150million – still found the money to employ an ‘energising for excellence delivery lead’ on a £35,500 salary.

The NHS has an annual budget of £106billion which, unlike other Government departments, has been protected from public spending cuts.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘There are now over 20,500 fewer managers, senior managers and admin staff, and nearly 14,500 more professionally qualified clinicians than there were in 2010.’
