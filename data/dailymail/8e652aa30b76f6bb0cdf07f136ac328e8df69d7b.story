A family who thought their camera was lost forever when it was dropped in a river were amazed when it resurfaced one year late - with every photo still in tact.

Danielle Boylan, 43, thought she had lost a gallery of precious memories when she dropped her mother’s new camera into the River Avon while enjoying a sunny weekend in Stratford, Warwickshire.

The camera had slipped from her grasp after she went to grab her three-year-old nephew Sam, who she feared was about to tumble into the water while feeding the ducks.

Danielle Boylan, 43, from Stratford, Warwickshrie, was amazed when the camera 
she dropped into the River Avon was recovered one year later with all 
the photos in tact

After hearing about Mrs Boylan's plight, Angie Deaves and Nigel Maris, scuba divers from the Stratford British Sub Aqua Club, even waded in to help.

They dived down into the river to try and retrieve the camera, but did not have any luck.

But one year later, contractors were drafted in to dredge the river for the first time in 14 years.

Although they were not supposed to be working on that part of the river, the kind-hearted workers agreed to look for the camera. 

And, amazingly, the camera was found - with every single photo still in tact. 

Despite being submerged under the water 
for one year, the memory card had remained dry. All the photos - including from her son Shaun's 18th 
birthday - were still there.

Mrs Boylan's mother Mandy said: 'I was completely gobsmacked when the dredgers pulled it out.

'I had been going down to the river throughout the year in the hope someone might know something about our camera.

'Then when I read they were dredging the river for the first time in 14 years I thought ‘Here’s my chance’ and called the company to tell them the story.

'Although they weren’t supposed to be 
dredging that part of the river, the two lads from Avon Navigation Trust
 were wonderful and agreed to have a look.

'The camera is quite distinctive and 
after they pulled the first scoop out - there it was lying on the top 
shining in the sun like a beacon.'

The family were spending the weekend 
celebrating Shakespeare’s birthday - who was famously born in 
Stratford-upon-Avon - when the incident took place.

But dredgers found the camera one year later and amazingly the media card was undamaged. The photos taken using the camera, 
including this one of her nephew Sam, were still in tact

The photos which were retrieved from the camera include pictures of the family enjoying a sunny weekend in Stratford and snaps taken from Mrs Boylan's son Shaun's 18th birthday party

She said: 
'It was a brand new camera when it was dropped and it held pictures of 
my eldest and youngest grandson - they were precious memories captured 
on film.

'We were devastated when we lost the camera - people kept telling me it was lost forever but I didn’t believe them.

'I knew somehow we would get it back, and seeing the beautiful pictures everyone thought were lost was amazing. It’s a miracle.'

Danielle's mother Mandy, who owned the camera, said it was a 'miracle' that the camera had been found by the dredgers

Photos which were taken at Mrs Boylan's son Shaun's 18th birthday party were also found on the camera
