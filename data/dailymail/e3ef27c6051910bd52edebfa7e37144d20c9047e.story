Have you ever felt the urge to lie to everybody, ruin the livelihoods of thousands, and make millions of pounds in the process?

Well now you can - and you don't even have to go to public school first.

A pair of businessmen have found a way to channel the urges that crippled the world's economy in 2008 without actually harming anybody - a family board game where everybody plays as a banker.

Designers: Thomas White, left, and Tom White, right, put the game together over the last year

Playing with the economy: The Greedy Nasty Bankers game encourages players to invest recklessly in different markets, which they move between with the roll of the dice

Wildcards: Players are encouraged to double-cross each other with cynical cards like those above

The Really Nasty Bankers Game, made by father and son Thomas and Tom White, encourages players to lie through their teeth, gamble with other people's money, and go running to the authorities when it all comes tumbling down.

The Monopoly-style board game casts players as the chief executives of fictitious banks with names like FullerCrookes and the RippOrf Banking Group. The aim is to invest the bank's cash as recklessly as possible without getting caught, and take home the biggest bonus.

Each turn the bankers get an opportunity to invest a secret amount of money - measured in billions - in markets like stocks, property and mortgages.

Depending on which square they land on, players might get to cash in their investments - and get their hands on a bonus - or ruthlessly crash the market and leave their opponents with nothing.

The first banker to trouser £10million is declared the winner.

As well as being encouraged to bluff and lie about the level of their investments, players can also use 'really nasty' cards to fiddle the markets, call in the regulators or trick other players into being 'out to lunch' when it's time to cash in.

And, as a tribute to the financial crash of 2008 where Lloyds TSB and RBS were bailed out by taxpayers, players also have recourse to a 'public bailout' card. If a market collapses while they are heavily invested in it, the player is allowed to keep all their money.

Bunch of bankers: Players invest on behalf of cynically-named institutions such as FullerCrookes Banking Group

It has been developed over the past year by Tom White, who was involved in marketing Trivial Pursuit and the Who Wants to Be A Millionaire boardgame.

Along with his son Thomas, the pair, from Monks Eleigh in Suffolk, have arranged for the game to be stocked in John Lewis and on Amazon, where it retails for £19.99.

Mr White said: 'People might not have been very interested in it 10 years ago.

'But with what's happening in the current financial climate, now is the right time to bring the game out.'

'It's all about sabotaging other players' plans. It's a cynical setup - you're encouraged to lie and as long as you get away with it you win'

'My ex-bank manager - who has tried out the game and thinks it's really funny - got a whizzkid from the city to help us with the different investments and advise us on how they should fit into the game.

'We have simplified the system and made it fun. It's a great game for winding people up and it really brings out different personalities.'
