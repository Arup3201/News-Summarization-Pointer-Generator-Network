Public pregnancy: The Duchess of Cambridge is not short of advice as 1,000 people gave their opinions on how she should raise her baby

The Duchess of Cambridge should be a stay-at-home mother and not rely on a nanny to help bring up her baby, according to an exclusive poll for The Mail on Sunday.

Since their marriage, Prince William and Kate have been at the forefront of a rejuvenation of the Royal Family, often showing an unwillingness to stick to tradition.

Princess Diana had a nanny to look after both William and his brother Harry. 

The Survation poll of 1,000 people found that more than half supported the couple’s plan to bring up their baby themselves. 

Nearly six out of ten believe Kate should ‘significantly’ cut back her Royal duties, though she is thought likely to return to work in some capacity by the autumn. 

Amid speculation that William will quit his job as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, three-quarters of those surveyed said he should continue.

But the suggestion that Kate’s parents, Mike and Carole Middleton, should stay in the background and let William’s father Prince Charles take the lead in helping raise the heir to the throne found little favour.

Fifty-three per cent thought the Middletons should be given a greater role in the baby’s formative years than Prince Charles and Camilla.

A Royal source said last night that the autumn programme of engagements is currently being decided and it is expected that Kate will be working alongside William and Harry. 

‘We are looking at all three principals being at work in the autumn,’ he said. ‘We are starting booking engagements for her then, as long as she feels well enough.’

The charity Action on Addiction, of which the Duchess is patron, has been told she wants to make another visit before the end of the year.

If Kate is well enough to go back to work in the autumn, it will mean she will have roughly three and a half months’ maternity leave – her last official engagement was on June 13 when she christened the Royal Princess cruise liner at Southampton Docks.

However, William will not be able to spend more than two weeks changing nappies. He has to return to the RAF in Anglesey, North Wales. 

Like any new father, he will taking 
his statutory paternity leave – the Ministry of Defence will grant him 
two weeks. He is unlikely to claim the £136.78 a week benefit.

Kate’s
 plan to return to the public eye in a few months brings her in line 
with the Queen’s maternity leave: she made her first public engagement 
three and a half months after giving birth to Prince Charles in November
 1948. 

The birth of the Royal baby will be recognised by MPs.

The Prime Minister will table a motion in the Commons congratulating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The then Princess 
Elizabeth also took two months off after the birth of Princess Anne, but
 on the advice of her doctors she had a reduced workload over the 
following months.

Princess 
Diana conducted her first public engagement five weeks after William was
 born in 1982. She took only four weeks out after the birth of Harry 
before she was back in public.

With the Duchess of Cambridge one day overdue, Royal baby fever has gripped the world.

There
 have been just short of a billion Google hits and almost £1 million has
 been placed in bets on the sex, name and date of birth of the new 
Royal.

Bookmaker Ladbrokes says bets will top £1million, a record for a single non-sporting ‘novelty’ event.

Two billion TV viewers in 180 countries are expected to tune in.

Outside
 the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital, in Paddington, Central London, 
where Kate will give birth, eight police officers are working 12-hour 
shifts. 

A medical team 
including Dr Marcus Setchell, the Queen’s former gynaecologist, who has 
delayed his retirement for the impending arrival, are standing by.

The Lindo Wing costs £6,265 for the first day and £2,200 for each one after that. 

Based
 on a trouble-free, three-day stay, Kate’s bill will top £10,000 – and 
it is possible she and William have booked more than one suite.

The Duchess’s antenatal expert has 
advised she ‘switch off the mobile’ so as not to feel inadequate while 
she waits for the Royal baby.

Christine
 Hill, who has had one-to-one sessions with Kate, says calls asking for 
news can make women feel to blame for not having yet given birth.

Hill’s
 advice to Kate is to enjoy ‘the luxury of time’, because after the baby
 is born ‘You’ll never have time completely to yourself.’ She suggests 
relaxing by going out for a meal or to the cinema.

Although
 Mrs Hill has declined to discuss her Royal client, her thinking is laid
 out in the book Christine Hill’s Pregnancy Guide.

She demolishes the idea that the epidural entails stigma, writing: ‘Natural childbirth doesn’t go on your CV.’

For
 William, she advises spending the days after the birth ‘just the three 
of you together. It is easier to adjust to having a baby if you have 
some space for yourselves.’
