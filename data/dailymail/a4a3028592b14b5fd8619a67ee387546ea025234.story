Their hands and feet bloodied by the wire, these desperate immigrants clung onto a fence for seven hours today in a desperate bid to start a new life in Spain.

The group were pictured as Spanish and Moroccan police engaged them in stand-off as they tried to cross the border from Africa.

Dozens of migrants attempted to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Thursday but ended up clinging to the top of metal fences while Spanish border patrols tried to convince them to hand themselves over.

At least 25 migrants, many with bloody bare feet, clung to the tops of fences for hours, shouting slogans and calling for help to enter Spain.

After a seven-hour standoff, border patrol managed to coax most of the immigrants down from the fence, gave them
 water and turned them over to Moroccan police.

The
 attempt was the latest in a recent wave of African migrants trying to 
breach the border between northern Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of 
Melilla and Ceuta located in north Africa.

The potential of a better life in Spain or making their way further into Europe sees many impoverished sub-Saharan men and women take the risk.

In Thursday's assault, several dozen men tried to scale the fences, and was not immediately clear whether any made it across.

Some shouted ‘Freedom!’ and ‘Victory!’ and called for the Red Cross to help them from being ordered to stay in Morocco.

Two
 migrants clung to the top of a lamp post by the fences. After hours of 
waiting, one buried his head in his hands. Others grimly held on to the 
fence, their bare feet visibly bloodied by the crossover attempt.

As
 the weather turned cold and the wind whipped along the picturesque 
cliffs of the Mediterranean coastline of this section of the fence, most
 of the migrants eventually gave in and descended by ladder. They were 
led limping out of Spain.

At
 least seven migrants had still refused to come down, including one on 
the lamp post, when Spanish authorities ejected journalists from the 
area.

Dialogue: Border patrol tried to get the group of men to come down peacefully several times during the standoff

Heat on: Many of the migrants, like this man, fainted after spending several hours on the fence, and had to be helped down to be given water

Giving in: One of the migrants climbs down on the Spanish side before being handed over the the Moroccan authorities

Morocco and Spain 
have stepped up border vigilance since February 6, when 15 migrants drowned 
trying to enter Spain's other north African coastal enclave, Ceuta.

Human rights groups and witnesses protested after it emerged Spanish security forces fired rubber bullets at the immigrants.

Earlier this month Spanish border police at Melilla  opened a suitcase to find a sub-Saharan man stuffed inside.

Officers confiscated the suitcase on Sunday after spotting a man struggling to lug a large and oddly-shaped bag at the border near the Moroccan town of Beni Ansar.

When the border guards gave chase, the suspect, a Moroccan national who resides in Spain, carried on trying to drag it away.

Once the officers caught up with the man, they arrested him and opened his load to reveal the contents of the suitcase.

Inside they found a contorted 19-year-old would-be migrant from Mali.
