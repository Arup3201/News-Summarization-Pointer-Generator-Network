A nurse who was so drunk on duty she had to be treated by her own accident and emergency department has been struck off.

Sheila Fletcher had taken a wine box on to her ward and did not notice she had cut herself when she smashed a bottle of medicine before colleagues intervened, a disciplinary hearing was told.

She was stopped administering drugs at eight in the morning to unsuspecting patients after a colleague noticed she was behaving unusually.

On duty: Nurse Sheila Fletcher has been struck off after bringing a box of wine with her to work and was drunk while treating patients at Hull Royal Infirmary (pictured)

Fletcher was employed at the Hull Royal Infirmary and went to work on May 15 2011 after drinking at home.

She told the ward sister that her arm felt tingly and that he head was 'not right', the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

An auxiliary nurse then reported that Fletcher has been seen in the toilet on her hands and knees clearing up 'pink fluid and broken glass on the floor'.

The panel heard that she was so drunk, she had not noticed that her finger was bleeding where she had cut it.

It was only noticed later that a nurse noticed that a diabetic man had not received any insulin and was suffering from high blood sugar levels.

On another occasion she had failed to give drugs to a patient and doctored records to show that she had.

When Fletcher's husband visited her later in A&E he confirmed she had been drinking at home.

At a disciplinary hearing on February 7 2012, Fletcher admitted that she had taken a box of wine to work.

'It is the first time I recollect taking the bottle and the box (of wine) to the ward,' she said.

'I remember covering up the box of wine I had in my bag with my cardigan when I was in the lift.

'I had a box of wine, a bottle of wine in my locker,' she confessed.

Case: The Nursing and Midwifery Council's offices in Portland Place, London, which heard how the inebriated nurse was taken to her own A&E

Rachel O'Connell, chair of the NMC panel, said: 'Having no information in relation to Mrs Fletcher's current employment or any information about her current personal circumstances, the panel could not be satisfied that she is no longer liable to put patients at unwarranted risk of harm or unlikely to act dishonestly in the future.

'Mrs Fletcher's actions and omissions represent a serious departure from the standards expected of a registered nurse.

'Her actions caused actual harm to her patients.

'She chose to cover up her omissions by falsifying patient records.

'Mrs Fletcher's health issues, which she had not properly addressed at the time of the allegations, also resulted in personal harm which saw her admitted to A&E.

She concluded that nothing short of a striking-off order in these circumstances would maintain public confidence in the profession.

The panel found allegations that Fletcher she attended work under the influence of alcohol and that she brought alcohol to work with her proved.

They also found the nurse guilty of failing to test the blood sugar levels of patient failing to provide him with insulin and failing to document her errors.

Allegations that she dishonestly forged the medication card for the patient were found not proved.

Fletcher faced further allegations relating to her conduct in November 2010 when she was accused of failing to prescribe drugs to a patient and then falsifying records on the following day.

The panel also found these allegations against her proved.

Fletcher, who was not present or represented at the hearing in central London, was struck off the register.
