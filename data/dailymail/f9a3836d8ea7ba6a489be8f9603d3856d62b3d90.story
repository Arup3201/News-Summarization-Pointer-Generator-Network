Great day: The actor Gary Sinise, who played Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump, said he was 'Honored to meet 98-year-old WW2 veteran Lt. Colonel. Dick Cole of the Doolittle Raiders. Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot. Amazing man'

It was the retaliatory strike that restored national morale after the staggering shock of Pearl Harbor.

And now the brave American airmen who carried out the 1942 Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, taking the fight to the heart of Japan for the first time, have been honored with the nation's highest award.

Only four of those 80 pilots are still alive and on Memorial Day, Lt. Col. Richard E. Cole, 98, accepted the Congressional Gold Medal on behalf of his comrades.

'This 
Congressional Gold Medal was hard earned and long overdue for a group of
 heroes who literally turned the tide for America in the Pacific Theater
 of World War II,' said Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, in a statement as Lt. 
Col. Cole accepted the medal as the grand marshall in Monday's Memorial 
Day parade in Washington.

'I'm proud to have carried the mantle to see these men receive the honor they so richly deserve.'

Cole and his three comrades, who are 94, 93 and 92 years old were finally honored last week during a ceremony in the Oval Office with President Obama.

The Doolittle Raiders, led by Army Air 
Forces Lt. Col. James Doolittle, launched their audacious retribution 
from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet in 16 B-25 bombers on 
April 18, 1942.

Approval: President Barack Obama signs an act to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders in recognition of their military service during World War II. Standing behind the president is 98-year-old retired, Lt. Col. Richard Cole - who flew in the raid

Hero:  Lt. Col. Richard Cole, a member of the Doolittle Raiders who bombed Japan, visits the grave site of Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, who he flew with on the bombing mission, buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, May 23, 2014

Their one-way mission was to strike Tokyo and Japan and restore the badly damaged pride of a nation still reeling from the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which cost 2,471 service-men's lives.

That attack destroyed the myth of American impregnability and in the dark months that followed the Imperial Japanese Navy's lightning advances across the Pacific caused national confidence to plummet.

President Roosevelt demanded an immediate response and it was Doolittle who provided him with one.

No military operation of this kind had ever been attempted before.

Unprecedented: Visible on the deck of the USS Hornet are eight of the 16 B-25 bombers that launched on April 18, 1942, to attack Tokyo

Staggering: An Army B-25 bomber takes off from the deck of the USS Hornet on its way to take part in the first U.S. air raid on Japan in April 1942

One way ticket: An Army B-25 takes off from the deck of the USS Hornet on its way to take part in the first U.S. air raid on Japan, the Doolittle Raid

Doolittle wanted to launch huge B-25 bombers from the deck of an aircraft carrier - stripping the planes of any unnecessary weight, with only enough fuel to clear Japan.

From there the planes would carry on to Nationalist China, then friendly to the US.

The Raiders, unaware of their mission, departed from the USS Hornet 600 miles east of Japan.

A chance encounter with a Japanese fishing boat, which they destroyed, forced the Raiders to leave early, meaning they would not have enough fuel to make it to their planned landing zones in China.

The plan was changed so that the raiders understood they had to traverse enemy territory.

Cole still remembers what Doolittle said about the unprecedented attack before they took off.

'He said that it was a very dangerous mission. Anybody wanted to back out, they could without any repercussions.'

No one backed out. 

Declaration of war: A ball of flame erupts from gasoline stores or aircraft at the Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941. Base personnel can only watch helplessly as the Japanese surprise attack destroys much of the area

Damage to morale: The USS Arizona burns after being hit by a Japanese bomb in Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941

Once aboard the plane, Cole said the crew was silent before take-off. Doolittle warned his crew they might not even reach China after the bombs were dropped.

Cole said that he began to tap out the rhythm to 'The Wabash Cannonball', a folk song about a train speeding to its destination.

Innovator: American aviator and military officer James Doolittle (1896 - 1993), wearing his uniform before he led the first aerial raid on Japan in World War II

He told The Washington Post that Doolittle shot him a look without saying word.

'I think maybe he thought I'd gone off the deep end,' said Cole.

After the bombs had been dropped on Tokyo, Doolittle ordered his crews to bail out of their planes at 9,000 feet, at night.

'For me, that was the scariest time,' Cole said, not knowing whether they would land in the South China Sea or land.

'I pulled the parachute ripcord so hard, and looking down, that I gave myself a black eye,' he said to the Washington Post.

Cole was left hanging 12-feet up in a tree's branches until the morning - when friendly locals rescued him.

'I
 started walking west,' said Cole to The Fort Hood Sentinel. 'We knew 
that if we walked west, we would be leaving and getting away from 
(Japanese) occupied territory.'

As a result, following the bombing, 15 of the planes crash-landed in rural China, while the 16th bomber made it to Russia.

The
 Raiders were aided by Chinese peasants, thousands of whom were later 
killed by the Japanese for their support of the Americans.

Aftermath: Jimmy Doolittle with his bombing crew and some Chinese friends are pictured here in China, after the airmen bailed out following Doolittle's raid on Japan, on April 18, 1942.

A. Potter, navigator, of Pierre, South Dakota

Of the 80 Raiders, three died during the landings and eight were captured by the Japanese. Three of those captured were executed, one died in captivity, and four remained prisoners of war and survived the war.

The attack, which did not do much damage to Japan's munitions factories, shifted momentum in the Pacific conflict.

'The Japanese were completely surprised,' said Colonel C.V. Glines, 91, the official Raiders historian.

'They did not think the United States had the range for that type of attack.'

Japan brought more troops home to protect the mainland, leaving it vulnerable in the Pacific. Rejuvenated US troops took advantage, defeating the Japanese at the Battle of Midway two months later, turning the war for good.

Tradition begins: James Doolittle, (third from left, front row) who led the air raid on Japan, April 18, 1942, and some of the men who flew with him drink a champagne toast from coffee cups during a reunion in North Africa on the first anniversary of the flight on July 14, 1943

Cole, 98, who was Doolittle's co-pilot, said the aviator deserved much of the credit for the raid. Doolittle died in 1993 at age 96.

'He personified the finest of human qualities, and he set a standard of military leadership that was unprecedented.'

As far as the Raiders' role in the war and continuing legend, Cole said, 'We are grateful we had the opportunity to serve and mindful that the nation benefited from our service.'

All 80 raiders were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The five imprisoned raiders were awarded the Purple Heart. Three received the Silver Star for gallantry and all received decorations from the Chinese government.

Doolittle was awarded the Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.

Cole retired from the U.S. Air Force in South Texas in January of 1967 after serving in Korea and having been stationed in Tokyo.

Last year, three of four surviving raiders attended the annual toast in Ohio that Jimmy Doolittle started in memory of their mission and fallen comrades.

They decided that last years would be the final toast.

'May they rest in peace,' Lt. Col. Richard Cole, 98, said before he and fellow Raiders — Lt. Col. Edward Saylor, 93, and Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, 92 — sipped cognac from specially engraved silver goblets. The 1896 cognac was saved for the occasion after being passed down from Doolittle.

Hundreds invited to the ceremony, including family members of deceased Raiders, watched as the three each called out 'here' as a historian read the names of all 80 of the original airmen.

The fourth surviving Raider, Lt. Col. Robert Hite, 93, couldn't travel to Ohio last year because of health problems.
