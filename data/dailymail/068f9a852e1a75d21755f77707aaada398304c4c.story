A service which lets women hire boyfriends or 'cuddle partners' to sleep with them - with anything sexual being strictly off limits - has started to take off in Japan.

Soine-ya Prime launched in Tokyo in 2011 following the success of Shimshima, a Japanese television drama about a recently divorced woman who has trouble sleeping at night.

The character discovers that simply lying next a man enables her to sleep peacefully and so she starts a business that rents young men to lonely sleepless women.

The real-life business acknowledges its debt to the TV series by posting a link to its website at the bottom of their homepage.

While non-sexual rent-a-date services for men have been around for some time, Soinye-Ya is believed to be the first for women.  

Operating as a dispatch service, Soine-Ya - which translates as sleep together shop - allows women to select a partner from a gallery of handsome young men and then take them home for a peaceful night's kip.

Pricing starts at 30,000 yen (US $364) for the 7 hour for the 'Standard Plan'.

An eight hour service will cost 33,000 yen ($400) and a full 12 hours will set you back 48,000 yen ($580).

A 'Date Plan', including a trip to Tokyo's Disney Resort costs 70,000 yen ($850, 2 tickets included), while a 'Premium Date Course', which allows the client to pick any activity she would like to do, such as going to the beach or watching the sun set.

According to the strict guidelines, sleeping must be done either at the client's house or a hotel.
