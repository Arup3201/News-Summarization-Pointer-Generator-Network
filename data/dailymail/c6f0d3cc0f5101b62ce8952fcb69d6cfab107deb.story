The stepdaughter of a war veteran was banned from wearing a T-shirt paying tribute to the lives lost on September 11, 2001 because it violated her school's dress code.

The sixth-grader, who has not been named, was told by administrators in the Orangevale, California, school system that she was to instead wear her school uniform as normal.

The 11-year-old's stepfather, Tim Foster, said his family wear the shirt every year to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Twin Towers. The shirt displays the names of those who lost their lives and says: 'In Darkness We Shine Brightest'.

According to CBS Sacremento, Mr Foster had told his stepdaughter: 'Wear it to honor what had happened on 9/11 and all the people that have perished and the lives that were changed on that days.'

Mr Foster, who has been a part of the military for nearly 25 years and has twice served in Iraq, said he understood the school's policy, but hoped administrators would understand the significance of the day for his family and make an exception.

School district spokesman Trent Allen said students are only allowed to wear non-uniform items on free dress days and September 11 wasn't one of them.

He said: 'Unfortunately that kind of shirt would not fit in that dress code policy.'

School District spokesman Trent Allen said the ban had nothing to do with the anniversary and that the school dress code was an 'important part' of the academic process

Mr Allen said banning the shirt had nothing to do with the anniversary, as the uniform policy was 'an important part of the academic process'.

He added: 'If you start making exceptions it is hard to draw the line.'
