A couple who swindled £1million from the NHS to fund their luxury lifestyle of globetrotting and flashy cars have been jailed for a total of five-and-a-half years.

John Leigh, 54, and Deborah Hancox, 45, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were involved in a seven-year conspiracy supplying equipment and services to the NHS at inflated prices.

It is thought the value of the fraud was more than £1million, with the couple pocketing about £300,000 which they used to buy holiday homes in Cyprus, Dubai and the Lake District.

They also bought a brand new Jaguar convertible and a Mercedes from the profits of the scam.

At Manchester Crown Court today the pair were jailed after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property at an earlier hearing.

Leigh was sentenced to 44 months and Hancox was given 24 months in prison.

They sparked a five-year manhunt after being interviewed by police about the fraud in 2008, before fleeing to the Turkish part of Cyprus.

It was only when they moved to the south part of the island, the Republic of Cyprus, that the couple were brought back to England last year to face justice.

Leigh worked for the NHS in purchasing and was responsible for buying mostly computers and other office equipment for various NHS departments. His partner Hancox also worked for the NHS.

For more than seven years, Leigh used a company called Action Direct Technology Ltd - of which his partner Hancox was the owner, sole shareholder and company director - to buy overpriced goods and defraud his employer the NHS.

The pair also used Bibi's IT Solutions Ltd and Wiscom Technology Ltd as a front to disguise their ongoing fraud between January 2001 and October 2008. 

Sgt Laura Walters, of GMP, said: 'This couple were involved in an well-orchestrated and meticulously planned conspiracy to defraud the NHS out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.

'This was not a get-rich-quick scheme - this was a sustained criminal enterprise stretching over seven years. Seven years is a long time to see the error of your ways but these individuals showed no remorse for their actions.

'In fact, we believe the very reason they switched companies later on was to cover up what they had done should there ever be an investigation. We also seized hundreds of email exchanges which showed they went to great lengths to cover their tracks by cooking the books to give them an air of authenticity.

'It is also clear they used the proceeds of their criminal activity to live a lavish lifestyle - the couple had a holiday home in the Lake District and they also invested in property in the United Arab Emirates and Cyprus.

'I also want to stress this is by no means a victimless crime. It is the NHS they scammed out of thousands of pounds - money which the NHS badly needs for the treatment of people with genuine illness. Every penny they plundered is money that was diverted away from someone in desperate need of medical treatment.

'I am delighted this case has finally been concluded and these con artists have been exposed and brought to justice.'

Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, said: 'This was a serious fraud against the NHS, cynically carried out by two individuals abusing their positions of trust and authority.

'Their determined attempts to evade justice compound the crimes. All suspicions of fraud reported to NHS Protect will be followed up, and investigated wherever appropriate.

'We press for prosecution of offenders and seek the strongest possible sanctions, so public money is not diverted from patient care.'
