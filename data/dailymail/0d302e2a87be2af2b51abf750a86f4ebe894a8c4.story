Manchester City could be without midfielder Yaya Toure for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham.

Toure has been away on international duty with the Ivory Coast and is not due back in training until Friday.

That leaves manager Manuel Pellegrini with a big decision ahead of a crucial game and it may well be that the City boss decides to rest his star midfielder ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League visit to CSKA Moscow.

Toure has endured an indifferent season so far and has certainly not played well in City’s two Champions League games, the defeat by Bayern Munich and the home draw with Roma.

However he did score as Ivory Coast lost 4-3 to DR Congo in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier earlier this week.

Pellegrini has options if he wishes to leave Toure out, with former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard in particularly good form.

Lampard scored eight goals against Tottenham during his 13 years with Chelsea, and he hopes to continue that good record this weekend.

He told Manchester City's official website: 'I’ve done alright against Spurs over the years and playing them was always a big game at Chelsea.

'Even when I was at West Ham, Tottenham were big rivals so I’ve always seen it is a big game and something to mark on the calendar and that doesn’t change now I’m at City.'
