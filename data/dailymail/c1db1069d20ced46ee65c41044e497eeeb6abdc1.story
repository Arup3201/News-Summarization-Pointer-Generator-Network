Aldo shoes has announced that it has cut ties with Terry Richardson as the fashion industry continues to distance itself from the controversial photographer.

PR director Wendie Godbout told BuzzFeed today: '[We] are not currently working with Terry Richardson and we have no plan to work with him in the future.'

Richardson, who has faced numerous accusations of sexual assault over the past few years, has worked for the Canadian shoe and accessories brand since 2010, shooting nine campaigns altogether.

Breaking away: Canadian shoe and accessories brand Aldo has cut ties with Terry Richardson as the fashion industry continues to distance itself from the controversial photographer

Aldo follows in the footsteps of Target and H&M, who also recently announced that they would no longer work with the 48-year-old. Vogue, Equinox and the New York Times have also cut ties with him.

Last week, New York magazine ran a cover story about the photographer, sparking new interest in the sexual assault claims made by models and other women he has worked with.

The story also prompted yet another victim to come forward. In an e-mail to Jezebel, a New York-based writer and stylist named Anna wrote that she was 23 when the controversial photographer invited her to a photo shoot at his home, where he proceeded to ask her to reveal her 'tits' while he posed next to her.

He then apparently asked her to crouch down on the floor, and 'suddenly, I felt a d*** pressing into the side of my face,' she revealed. 'He pressed it to my lips. He clearly wanted a blow job and wanted it documented on camera.'

Richardson has strongly denied previous accusations that he has acted inappropriately towards them.

In a letter obtained by Page Six in March, he called the allegations 'lies' and said the claims were nothing more than an 'emotionally-charged witch-hunt'.

'People 
have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales,' he 
said. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these 
rumors. Without my voice, all that remain are the lies.'

Yet the allegations continue, coming from high profile celebrities and actresses, as well younger, more anonymous models.

'We are not currently working with him and we have no plan to work with him in the future'

Supermodel Coco Rocha told Fashion magazine in July 2010: 'I've shot with [Richardson] but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.'

In April of this year, British model Emma Appleton claimed he offered her a shoot with Vogue magazine in exchange for sex.

And Danish model Rie Rasmussen said that the girls who work with Richardson 'are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.'

Richardson stated in the New York Magazine piece that despite all the controversy, he feels 'okay with myself about everything.'
