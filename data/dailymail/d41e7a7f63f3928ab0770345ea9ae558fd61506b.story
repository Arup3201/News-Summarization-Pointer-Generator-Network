Brazil's sports tribunal says Chile playmaker Jorge Valdivia faces a 12-match suspension for stamping on an opponent in a Brazilian league match.

The Palmeiras player stepped on Flamengo midfielder Amaral following a battle over the ball in a match Wednesday. Valdivia was immediately sent off.

Playing in his first match in nearly a month following injury, Valdivia came on as a half-time substitute and played for only  30 minutes before he was given his marching orders. However, he did help Palmeiras erase a 2-0 halftime deficit to draw 2-2.

The playmaker apologised and said he regretted his actions. Palmeiras coach Dorival Jr. said the club will punish Valdivia, but did not disclose how.

Palmeiras has the most national titles of any Brazilian club, but is currently fighting against relegation.
