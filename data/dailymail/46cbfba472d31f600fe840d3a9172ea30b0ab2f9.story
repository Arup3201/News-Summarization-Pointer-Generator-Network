The Environment Agency has been accused of spiralling ‘out of control’ after it was revealed its staff claimed £12.8 million in expenses last year.

The figure is up more than £3.8 million – or 43 per cent – on the previous 12 months.

Just half of that rise could have covered the cost of river dredging that may have saved the Somerset Levels from flooding– work the beleaguered quango decided not to carry out.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that in the year to March 2013, the agency spent  £2.9 million on hotels, £8.8 million on train travel and £1.1 million on meals for staff working away from home.

Bryony Sadler, whose Somerset home was flooded for three weeks, said: ‘The agency wrecked our homes and lives and we are getting nothing back. The expenses are inexcusable... they need to be justified.’

Ian Liddell-Grainger, the  Tory MP for Bridgwater in Somerset, said: ‘It is simply typical of the agency. It’s a quango out of control and it has lost all public confidence.

‘It has become an evangelical environmental group when it suits them, the rest of the time [staff] appear to be drinking expensive champagne in hotels.’

The agency said hotel expenses included bills such as meeting room hire; and that it would recoup some money from its ‘external partners’. A spokesman said: ‘One in five days in 2012 were in flood and we had to move our teams across the country to respond to numerous incidents.’

In the financial year which is just about to end, the agency has already spent £10 million, but the figures are incomplete.

More than 7,000 homes were flooded this winter, with insurers’ last week saying they expected to pay out about £446 million in compensation.  Dredging stretches of the rivers Tone and Parrett before the floods would have cost the agency about £1.7 million.
