A report  found staff at Homerton Hospital were slow to recognise patients deteriorating, and suffered breakdowns in communication

An investigation into a hospital where four women died in 12 months before or during childbirth has found a series of concerns, it has been revealed.

Inspectors from the NHS's London clinical senate found that staff at Homerton Hospital, Hackney, were slow at recognising patients were deteriorating, and identified breakdowns in communication.

Their report identified common themes in some but not all of the deaths, including a lack of involvement from consultants.

The findings came after two unannounced inspections by the Care Quality Commission, following the death of a fifth woman in January this year, reports the Evening Standard.

The first fatality occurred in 2013, when Pat Williams passed away following a Caesarean section procedure which she elected to have.

A subsequent report found that she was over 40, obese, had previously miscarried and had a large fibroid in her uterus.

Adeline Keh, 40, was the next to die in October the same year after she contracted a fatal infection following a Caesarean at Homerton.

She was transferred from the east London medical centre to a specialist heart and lung unit in Cambridge, but died after she refused a blood transfusion because she was a Jehova's Witness.

A report into her death found that her refusal 'may have compromised the final medical intervention' in order to save her life.

It was listed as a cause of death alongside acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and an infection of the Caesarean wound. 

The third and fourth deaths occurred in March and June last year, at which point the CQC began investigating, and the London clinical senate was called in after a fifth death in January this year.

Such deaths are extremely rare - therefore it was viewed as unusual for a single hospital to have so many deaths in a short period.

Adeline Keh, 40, was one of five to die at the hospital, four of which perished in 12 months. She contracted an infection after a Caesarean, and refused a blood transfusion because she was a Jehova's Witness

In the whole of England and Wales in 2013 there were just 47 maternal deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the six-week period following birth - out of almost 700,000 deliveries.

In response to the report, which was made public this week, Tim Melville-Ross, the chairman of Homerton NHS Trust, said: 'This issue is clearly one of real concern to us. We have to devote all of our efforts to learning lessons.'

Homerton chief executive Tracey Fletcher added that the report found no 'silver bullet' would have prevented the deaths.

In response to the findings, staff at Homerton have been given extra training and consultant cover on wards has been increased to 98 hours a week.
