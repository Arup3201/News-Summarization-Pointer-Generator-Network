Two PETA volunteers wore little more than  black and white body paint and sat on a New York footpath in a bathtub to highlight what they claim is the mistreatment of orcas by SeaWorld. 

The protest outside Macy's landmark store was timed to coincide with the department store's annual Thanksgiving Day Parade in which the popular marine attraction will again feature a float. 

A spokeswoman for PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), which often uses near-nudity in their attempts to draw attention to their message, claims SeaWorld mislead the public on the quality of their  orcas' lives.

The protesters bathtub statement was accompanied by a sign asked, 'Could you live in your bathtub', implying orcas at SeaWorld live confines comparable to a human's household bath.  

'SeaWorld last year misled the public [at the parade] with a float that featured orcas leaping in an open, magnificent sea, when the reality is that orcas at SeaWorld lead miserable, deprived lives in tiny concrete tanks and go mad from the confinement,' the spokeswoman said. 

SeaWorld's director of corporate communications, Aimee Jeansonne Becka, rejects the criticism saying their animals are well cared for and the park is proud of its 'world-class standards'.

The two women were mostly naked, painted in the pattern of killer whales, as they made their statement

Last year's SeaWorld float featured cartoon depictions of orcas, also known as killer whales, and a dolphin in a colourful ocean setting.

That 2013 float was protested by 12-year-old Rose McCoy, who climbed the barricade to show a sign saying, 'Boycott SeaWorld'. 

The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has run since 1924, when it began as The Christmas Parade, making it the second oldest in the US. It has been televised since 1952.
