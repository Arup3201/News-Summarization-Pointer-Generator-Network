These daredevil performers are putting their lives on the line every day to impress tourists in Thailand.

Fearless crocodile ‘wrestlers’ put their heads and hands inside the reptiles’ open mouths – all for visitors who spend £10 to watch the show.

In some cases the adrenaline junkies narrowly avoid being snapped by the crocodiles’ powerful jaws, as shown in the below video.

Workers at the Samphran Elephant Ground & Zoo, near Bangkok, are shown performing death-defying stunts in the style of Krai Thong, a legendary Thai crocodile hunter.

In one scene, a man bravely sticks his head inside a crocodile’s gaping mouth for several seconds before he pulls back with a look of relief on his face.

One of his colleagues is shown smiling and waving to the crowd while head his is between the reptile's jagged teeth.

Along with their heads, the crocodile 'wrestlers' risk their limbs inside the snapping crocs' mouths as well

Another man carefully lifts the crocodile’s head and sticks his hand in its mouth, moments before its jaws snap down.

The wranglers have been performing the stunts at the zoo on the outskirts of Bangkok since it was set up in 1985.

Today, the shows take place twice daily at the zoo, one hour west of the Thai capital.

It is situated on 60 acres of land, where tourists can also pose for photos with captive tigers or ride elephants.

Visitors can also watch elephant shows with re-enactments of ancient battle scenes in full regalia. In other shows, elephants ‘dance’ and play football.
