Andy Murray was knocked out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage by Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday as the defending champion succumbed meekly in straight sets.

Despite having won two major titles and Olympic gold, Murray has at times been guilty of losing with a whimper at the highest level.

Here, Sportsmail looks back at occasions when the Scot has underperformed.

French Open 2014 SF – Rafael Nadal beat Andy Murray 6-3, 6-2, 6-1

Having missed Roland Garros the year before due to a back injury, Murray impressively reached the last four in Paris for a second time. Two tough five-setters earlier in the tournament against Gael Monfils and Philipp Kohlschreiber came back to bite as the Scot ran out of gas against the ‘King of Clay’, winning only 10 points on Nadal’s serve as he was knocked out in one hour and 40 minutes.

US Open 2013 QF – Stan Wawrinka beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-3, 6-2

Coming into a Grand Slam for the first time as a defending champion and with the confidence gained from ending the 77-year wait for a Wimbledon male champion, Murray was highly fancied to claim a second US Open crown. Big-hitting Wawrinka prevailed, though, in two hours and 15 minutes as a frustrated Murray claimed he was mentally exhausted after his SW19 heroics.

Australian Open 2011 F – Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-2, 6-3

Djokovic condemned Murray to his third Grand Slam final defeat as the Serbian stormed to victory on a hot and humid night in Melbourne. A nervy start cost Murray and he failed to find a way back into the match. Murray struggled to deal with the aftermath as he suffered a slump in form, losing his next three tournament openers in straight sets.

French Open 2010 4R – Tomas Berdych beat Andy Murray 6-4, 7-5, 6-3

Dark clouds gathered over Court Suzanne Lenglen as Murray’s frustrations boiled over in a rain-delayed encounter. Play looked to be done for the day as the match was suspended at 8pm due to rain with Berdych leading 6-4, 3-4, but the weather cleared and the players returned to the court. Murray looked as if he did not want to be there and the Czech took just 50 minutes to wrap up the win.

US Open 2009 4R – Marin Cilic beat Andy Murray 7-5, 6-2, 6-2

Murray always reckoned his search for a Grand Slam title would end on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows and rightly so after reaching the final the previous year. However, Murray failed to take two set points in the first set and had no answer to Cilic’s power as the Croatian took charge to seal the upset. It later transpired that Murray had been suffering a wrist injury.
