Three police officers in Opa-Locka, Florida, have been suspended for allegedly giving pop star Justin Bieber an unauthorized escort from the airport just days before his DUI arrest.

City spokesman David Chiverton confirmed Friday that an investigation has been launched to determine if the Opa-Locka Police Department staffers in question accompanied the hard-partying singer from his private jet to the King of Diamonds strip club in Miami Gardens Monday.

'You can have fun in Miami, but not too much fun,' Chiverton said.

Was he drunk? Allegations have been made that Miami Beach police officers erroneously said that Justin Bieber's blood alcohol level was much higher than it actually was on the night of his arrest

Police escorts from the airport are not uncommon, but they must follow procedure because they involve city vehicles, Chiverton added.

Administrators had not authorized any escort for Bieber in this case.

Monday night, the King of Diamonds club tweeted that Bieber ordered $75,000 in dollar bills. The club's operator later acknowledged that was an exaggeration and that the singer only stayed about an hour.

Bieber and his large entourage were escorted to a closed-off section of the club. They enjoyed the dancers and ordered a large amount of bottled water, but no alcoholic beverages were sold to them, said Ricky 'Disco Rick' Taylor in a statement.

'He had a lot of fun,' Taylor said. 'We hope he returns again.'

Bieber's outing to the gentlemanâ€™s club came three days before he was arrested in Miami Bbeach on suspicion of racing a rented yellow Lamborghini while intoxicated.  

The 19-year-old pop star is now facing possible jail time on charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license.

Police said they arrested a bleary-eyed Bieber with alcohol on his breath after officers saw him drag-racing before dawn Thursday on a palm-lined residential street in Miami Beach, his luxury rental traveling at nearly twice the 30mph speed limit.

He was arrested along with R&B 
singer Khalil Amir Sharieff, who was driving a Ferrari, after police saw
 them racing just after 4am, with two other vehicles apparently being 
used to block off the area.

The Canadian heartthrob later admitted smoking marijuana, drinking and taking a prescription medication, police said.

Meanwhile, TMZ reported
 Friday that Miami Beach police officers may have lied about Bieber's 
blood alcohol level, writing in his arrest report that it was much 
higher than it actually was

According to the gossip site's sources, the singer's blood alcohol level at the time of his arrest was only .014, while police claimed yesterday that it was .04. Legal level of intoxication in Florida is .08.

However, people under the age of 21 are considered to be driving under the influence if they have a blood-alcohol content of 0.02 per cent or more - a level the 5 foot 9, 140-pound star could reach with one drink.

The criminal complaint stated that on two separate occasions two different officers smelled the odor of alcohol of the singer's breath. Officials also said that Bieber failed his field sobriety test.

According to the arrest report, Bieber 'had slow deliberate movements" and appeared to be in a stupor when the officer ordered him to exit his vehicle. Bieber was arrested after repeatedly refusing to put his hands on his vehicle so the officer could pat him down to look for weapons, the report said. 

It says he cursed several times at the officer and demanded to know why he was being arrested. At one point, Bieber said to an officer: 'What the f--- did I do, why did you stop me?'
