Vic Emery filed three claims including one for mileage to attend the funerals of the crash's victims

The head of the organisation that oversees Police Scotland charged hundreds of pounds to the taxpayer to attend funerals of victims of the Clutha helicopter tragedy.

Vic Emery was accused of leaving an ‘exceptionally bad taste’ after demanding money to pay his respects.

Mr Emery, the £90,000-a-year chairman of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), attended the funerals of pilot Captain David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis. 

He filed three claims, including one for £135, and another for £540, as well as mileage.

He has since used the money to make a donation to the Clutha Trust, which supports disadvantaged young people.

However, frontline officers were horrified that he ever thought it was appropriate to charge expenses.

Brian Docherty, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ‘Hundreds of police officers willingly gave up their own time to attend the funerals and memorials of the Clutha victims and did so simply because it was the right thing to do.’

Mr Traill, who was attached to the Police Scotland air support unit, and the two constables were killed when the Eurocopter EC 135 crashed on to the Glasgow bar in November 2013.

Patrons John McGarrigle, Mark O’Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins and Samuel McGhee were killed and Joe Cusker later died in hospital, taking the death toll to ten.

The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) is set to publish its conclusions into the cause of the crash soon.

The funeral of Captain Traill was held at the University of Glasgow. PC Collins was buried on Arran and a funeral was held for PC Nelis at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Glasgow.

However, the SPA chief defended his decision. Mr Emery said: ‘I felt it important to ensure that the SPA was represented at each of these occasions, and we all judged that these were professional responsibilities as well as personal commitments.

‘We will clearly reflect on these examples in considering our future commitments and will seek further clarity from the Scottish Government on what constitutes corporate and personal activities.’

A spokesman for the police watchdog said: ‘Senior police officers made attending these events a priority for their professional time. The SPA also shared that approach.

‘SPA members are non-executives and are remunerated at a day rate for their duties, plus travel expenses.

‘It is SPA’s view that all of the activities listed are appropriate activities for non-executive board members to have undertaken as corporate responsibilities and commitments, and to have included within the range of duties for which they are reimbursed.’
