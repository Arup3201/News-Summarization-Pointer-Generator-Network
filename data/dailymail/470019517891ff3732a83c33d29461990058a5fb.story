Tall, blonde and fearsomely clever, 42-year-old Helena Seger is a multimillionaire businesswoman who doesn't take any prisoners.

She also happens to be the girlfriend of Swedish footballer, Zlatan Ibrahimovich, 31, whose team, Paris St Germain, just welcomed David Beckham into its ranks.

Dubbed the 'Queen Bee of French WAGS' by local tabloids, it is Seger who Victoria Beckham will need to impress if she is to make any headway with the wives of David's new team mates.

And with Victoria, 38, set to attend Paris St Germain's match against Marseille on Sunday, the moment when she finally comes face to face with Seger isn't far away.

But will the high-powered pair get along? According to French sources, Helena is known as the 'Victoria Beckham of Paris' and she's not keen on having a rival for the spotlight.

The source added: 'If Posh is to fit in at PSG, she will need to try to befriend Zlatan’s girlfriend and not do anything that will get on her nerves.

'Helena is a shrewd and powerful woman who is a real force in Paris. She is refined, elegant and classy and comes from a respectable family.

'But she is also someone who made her own money and got where she is today through sheer force of ambition.

'In many ways she is very similar to Victoria. They could end up being good friends. After all, she is one of the few WAGs at PSG who speaks English.

'But they are so similar I can also imagine them having a huge falling out. And if Posh gets on Helena’s wrong side, life could be very difficult for her in Paris. She might find herself completely cut off from the other WAGs.'

Beauty: Argentine model, Yanina Screpante

Other PSG WAGs include TV presenter, Chiara Picone, 22, the Italian wife of Argentinian midfielder Javier Pastore, Yanina Screpante, 27, the stunning model girlfriend of striker Ezequiel Lavezzi, and midfielder Jérémy Ménez' reality star lover, Emilie Nefnaf, 26.

Unlike British WAGs, the trio are hardly ever seen in public and rarely give interviews. What's more, the threesome - and Seger - consider themselves to be the epitome of Parisian chic and wouldn't be seen dead in obvious logos and bling, unlike the England team WAGs.

While Victoria was top dog among England team WAGs such as Coleen Rooney, Alex Gerrard and Melanie Slade, building any kind of relationship with the PSG sorority means winning the approval of the fearsome Seger.

Seger was memorably described by boyfriend Zlatan Ibrahimovich as an 'evil super bitch deluxe' in his 2011 autobiography, I Am Zlatan.

He also likened her to a mafia boss, saying she was like 'Tony Montana in Scarface, only a girl.'

Despite Zlatan's unflattering choice of words and her initial rejection of him, the couple have been together since 2002 after meeting in the southern Swedish city of Malmö, and have two children, Maxmillian, seven, and Vincent, five.

Like his girlfriend, the Swedish striker is notoriously spiky, and admits he doesn't suffer fools gladly.

Zlatan is also believed to be less than impressed with the Beckhams' impending arrival, with sources revealing that the footballer sees David Beckham as little more than a trophy.

Said a PSG source: 'Zlatan still sees himself as one of the best players in the world and only wants to play with his equals. He wants to win trophies — not be paraded next to them.'

While Paris might be warmer than London, with a reception committee like that waiting for them, the Beckhams could soon find that the frosty weather has followed them to France.
