Scores of grey seal pups are feared to have died after being swept from beaches by last week’s devastating surge tide.

The National Trust confirmed that 263 pups were reported missing on Thursday night from a breeding colony at Horsey Gap, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

A rescue operation is under way after about 190 of the pups were washed up alive on nearby beaches, along with the bodies of several others. The rest are feared drowned.

An unknown number of pups are also missing from the National Trust reserve at Blakeney Point in north Norfolk, along with 20 from an offshore colony at Scroby Sands, near Great Yarmouth.

The RSPCA rescue centre at East Winch, near King’s Lynn, took in 17 pups on Friday and 20 more yesterday – on top of the 50 it was already looking after.

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘We are concerned about the pups as it is the height of the pupping season and they are vulnerable. Our inspectors are patrolling beaches between Great Yarmouth and Cromer and responding to reports of seals that have washed up. We are taking them in if they are distressed or injured.’

Eilish Rothney of the Friends of Horsey Seals said 130 of the 190 pups that had washed up were under three weeks old and needed their mothers’ milk. She said: ‘It is possible many of them might die.’

A National Trust spokesman said seal pups washed up on beaches should only be approached by wildlife experts from approved groups or RSPCA staff.

The spokesman said: ‘Please do not attempt to move them or encourage them to return to the sea.’

Meanwhile, it has emerged that residents who ignored warnings to evacuate seaside homes at risk of flooding last week were asked to sign disclaimer forms by police.

The forms stated that anyone who signed accepted that they were putting themselves at risk from sea water ‘up to a depth of three metres’ by staying in their homes.

A clause added that emergency services would be ‘stretched to their capacity’ in the event of flooding, meaning people might not be rescued until waters had subsided.

More than 1,000 residents of Jaywick, near Clacton, Essex, were asked to sign after refusing to evacuate on Thursday.

One villager said: ‘I got the impression they wanted me to sign as  they were worried about being sued if I drowned.’

In the event, the water was kept back by the sea wall at Jaywick when the surge tide struck in the early hours of Friday and no homes were flooded.

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed leaflets were handed out in Jaywick but added: ‘It was not done to absolve emergency services of responsibility should the occupants have got into difficulty.’

A clean-up operation was still under way yesterday after 1,400 homes and businesses around Britain were flooded. One of the worst affected areas was Boston, Lincolnshire, where 300 homes were flooded. Five clifftop bungalows were washed away at Hemsby, near Great Yarmouth.

The Environment Agency said damage had been minimised by improved flood defences, protecting at least 800,000 homes.
