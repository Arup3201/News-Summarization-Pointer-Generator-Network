Judging by the sullen display from Johnny 'Football' Manziel when he was left to 22nd pick in the NFL draft on Thursday, the emergence of an apparent scathing Patriots' report on him will add insult to injury.

According to an anonymous tipster who passed the scathing scouting report to BroBible, Manziel was dubbed 'cocky' and 'a spoiled brat' by the New England Patriots.

The report, which BroBible claims to have verified, also warned that the former star quarterback at Texas A&M University comes from a family with 'outlaw bloodlines'.

When it comes to his performance on the football field, the 2012 Heisman Trophy Winner is noted for his formidable talent as 'an outstanding athlete' with a 'unique skill set'.

However the report also claims that his teammates resent him in the off-season 'when he isn't coming to workouts and they are busting their butt'.

The Patriots 'scouting report' claims that Manziel doesn't study the game and sources at Texas A&M are looking forward to getting rid of him because he is a 'me-guy'.

The words 'arrogant' and 'full of himself' also appear but the author of the report does admit Manziel has 'ultimate confidence'. It is remarked upon that he 'will drink' but doesn't smoke and his arrest reports are included.

The report also noted that the player doesn't take too kindly to being yelled at by coaches. The Patriots appear to criticize the fact that the quarterback's father bought him a luxury car and his grandfather gives him an allowance.

Despite the sensational report's alleged veracity, NFL experts have quickly judges it a fake. Jeff Howe, New England Patriots beat reporter for the Boston Herald, tweeted on Friday: 'Fake. Not how Patriots numerical draft grades are presented.'

Allsportsnolife.com added: 'This is fake, draft grade's are FAR more complicated than that. plus the scouting report has OLD Patriots logo. Nice try though.'
