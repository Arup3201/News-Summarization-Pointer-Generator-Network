Pele has been admitted to a hospital in Sao Paulo to undergo a 'medical evaluation' after cancelling his appearance at an event in his museum.

The Albert Einstein hospital did not disclose why Pele was admitted, saying in a statement Wednesday evening only that he will 'undergo exams.'

The private Agencia Estado news service and other local media say the 74-year-old football great is suffering from stomach pain, but his condition was not serious.
