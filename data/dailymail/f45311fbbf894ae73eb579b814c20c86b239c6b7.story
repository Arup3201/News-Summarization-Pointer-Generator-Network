It is a folk remedy fit for a princess.

As she battles acute morning sickness, the Duchess of Cambridge has apparently turned to a traditional cure for queasiness: lavender shortbread biscuits.

The plant has long been used as an anti-nausea remedy, though pregnant women are usually advised to administer it in the form of a few drops of oil in the bath.

Traditional cure: Kate is said to be munching away on lavender biscuits, which were recommended to her by the Duchess of Cornwall to ease morning sickness

However, Kate is said to have had the 
recommendation from her husband’s stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, 
who is known to be a fan of lavender biscuits.

The Royal Family has been sending her boxes of the unusual shortbread, which is sold by Prince Charles’s Duchy Originals brand as well as the Queen's favourite London store Fortnum and Mason, the Sun reported.

In a cameo on Radio 4’s The Archers last year, Camilla raved about the lavender shortbread baked for her at Ambridge’s hotel, Grey Gables.

Herbal tea (especially ginger) is used to counteract sickness and herbal teas

made with chamomile, lemon balm, and peppermint are also known to reduce nausea

It is recommended that you drink flat, room-temperature ginger ale to settle your stomach

Sniffing a slice of lemon has been reported to help

Crackers are the plainest food for those feeling sick

Nuts and peanut's high protein content is said to help

Fennel seed is a nausea remedy from Chinese folk medicine
