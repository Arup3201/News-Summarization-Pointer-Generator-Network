The world famous golden arches fast-food chain, known for their classic cheeseburgers and happy meals, is serving up a gourmet menu.

It will be available to McDonald's customers in Australia after the fancy new range launched in Sydney on Thursday and is set to roll out across the country in the next six to nine months.

This is part of the company's $1billion remodelling strategy which will introduce more of its Australian fast-food restaurants over the next five years, The Australian reports.

The 'create your own gourmet burger' offers 19 different fillings served on wooden platters with a side of fries in a basket, complete with table service.

Customers can order their customised burgers on a digital touch-screen menu also offers up never seen before choices at McDonald's such as guacamole, tortilla chips and a range of other sauces.

McDonald's chief executive Andrew Gregory told The Australian there are plans to include home deliveries as part of the service.

'We will build another three of these before the end of the year and test and learn and listen to our customers ... and work out what works best,' Mr Gregory said.

'We plan to do it over the next 12 months in every restaurant around Australia.'

There will also be table service for customers and home deliveries for 'create your own burgers' customers

Mr Gregory said there will also be a change in the working culture and how staff interact with customers.

Chris Grant, the company's corporate communications manager, told the Daily Telegraph that the 'foodie revolution' prompted the change while he hopes the new range would appeal to those who are seeking something 'a little more sophisticated' - particularly parents.

The company will be trialling the menu in Castle Hill, northwestern Sydney, before it's offered at other restaurants. 

There are about 930 McDonald's restaurants across Australia which serves more than 1.7 million customers a day.
