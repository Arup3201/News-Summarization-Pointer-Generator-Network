A woman who was told she was 'too big' to be a model when she weighed just 8st has relaunched her fashion career.

Nina Blakemore, who is 5ft 10in tall and is now a size 18, has carved out a successful career as a plus-size model since recovering from an eating disorder and gaining weight.

At her lowest ebb, she ate only one apple a day - which comes to just 80 calories - in an attempt to starve herself down to a size zero.

Nina Blakemore, who used to eat just an apple a day to starve herself in the hope of becoming a size zero model, is now a healthy size 18 and has a successful plus-size modelling career

For years Nina, 35, from Wolverhampton, West Mids, starved herself in the hope of launching a career in the fashion industry.

But despite making herself ill, Nina claims she was told she was 'too big' for the modelling agency she wanted to join.

'I wanted to become a model so desperately that I thought starving myself was the only option.

'I lived off an apple a day and would exercise vigorously.'

Nina said: 'My hair was falling out and I looked awful as my health started deteriorating. My mood swings were horrendous - I was so unhappy. 

At 5ft 10in Nina (pictured in her early 20s) would eat just an apple a day to starve herself down to a size zero but was devastated when she claims she was told she was still too big to be a model

'My mum could see how skinny I’d become and she witnessed first-hand the effects an eating disorder were having on my body.

'We went to the doctor and from there I was referred to a therapist.'

Finally, after a year-long battle, Nina began eating properly again, allowed herself to gain weight and started to regain her confidence.

Since then she hasn’t looked back. Nina reverted to her natural curvy shape and has been working with Ford Models' 12-plus division.

She now refuses to weigh herself as part of her healing process and has experienced a fantastic career working all over the world - including jobs in New York and India.

She's modelled for household names such as Evans, M&S, House of Fraser and Harrods, as well as Italian fashion brands, doing both catwalk and catalogue work.

Nina says: 'I'm embracing who I am and I have no time for any negativity surrounding plus-size models'

Since being told she still wasn't small enough to model, Nina decided to gain weight naturally and has gone from strength-to-strength modelling all over the world for top plus-size brands

Nina said: 'I’m just trying to show people that you don’t need to be size zero to be a model.

'I’m now a size 18 and use my time to help others who suffer from anorexia to face their battles with food.

'I eat healthy food and exercise in moderation - I no longer restrict myself and eat foods I enjoy.'

Nina explains how she is not promoting obesity - she wants to show people that you can be happy and womanly, whatever size you are.

She said: 'Women shouldn’t feel forced to be thin - we should just be happy with our natural shape.'

Nina went back up to her natural shape and decided to go into plus-size modelling instead. She has experienced a fantastic career working all over the world - including work in New York and India

She says: 'There need to be more curvy girls modelling on our high street who represent natural women.'

Nina has taken on critics in the past but vows that those who haven’t been in her shoes don’t have the right to judge her size or weight.

She said: 'I’m embracing who I am and I have no time for any negativity surrounding plus-size models.'

Nina is also currently signed with Hughes Models who promote curvy women.

Director Cheryl Hughes said: 'Our Models are healthy, fit, beautifully proportioned and have that magic something in front of the camera - what more could society need for realistic role models?

'For me they prove that every woman can be healthy and attractive irrespective of size. However, health and fitness are paramount. An unfit size zero is as unacceptable as an unfit 14, 16, 18 etc.

'We would encourage all women to love their bodies.'
