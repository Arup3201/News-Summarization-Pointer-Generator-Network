Even though their wedding venue flooded, this couple were determined the weather would not put a dampener on their big day.

To make light of the rain, Sarah and Mark Camilletti, posed for their photographs armed with umbrellas, wellington boots and towels to make the most of their big day at the waterlogged Hotel Felix in Cambridge.

The bride, 29, and groom, 34, had dreamed of taking their vows among the hotel’s idyllic gardens but were forced to make their lifelong commitments indoors.

Not letting the deluge dampen their spirit, the bride and groom still headed for the gardens to take their wedding photographs, donning wellies to pose for the camera.

The couple said they were always prepared for the great British weather but didn’t expect to have their wedding in the middle of a lake.

Getting hitched: Mrs Camilletti had to hitch up her wedding dress to get to the chairs but her gallant groom carried her back through the knee-high water

Mrs Camilletti said her dreams of a sunlit outdoor ceremony were shattered, but added she ‘could not have imagined anything better’.

She said: ‘We knew it was going to be wet in the run up to it so we brought a whole load of wellies and umbrellas and asked the guests to do the same.

‘It was quite funny when they were arriving in the morning and some of the guests thought there was a lovely lake in the garden.

‘But when they saw the tables and chairs poking out of the middle they realised it wasn’t a lake and that was where we were supposed to have the wedding. The water was knee deep.’

Never wetter: While the couple had hoped for a sunny ceremony, it turned out to be 'better than imagined'

Mrs Camilletti had to hitch up her white dress to wade through the knee deep floodwater to climb onto a romantic bench.

Mr Camilletti braved the two feet floods, with the tails of his morning suit dangling just feet above the murky water.

They were joined by family members, the best man and bridesmaids, who had all been ordered to bring their wellies so the memorable photoshoot could still go ahead.

The groom and one of his friends gallantly carried the giggling bride back to dry land after the muddy memories had been captured.

Mrs Camilletti, a family support worker at a children’s centre and civil servant at the Ministry of Justice Mark from north London, said the flooding made the occasion.

She said: ‘We could not have imagined anything better.’

They shared their wet wedding day with 100 guests and are now on their honeymoon in Norfolk where they hope the sun will shine.

Shara Ross, general manager of Hotel Felix, said the garden was ‘only good for punting’ after recent heavy rains.

She praised the Camillettis for ‘taking it all in their stride’ when many couples would have ‘completely lost it’.

On the day elsewhere in Cambridge, families battled to save their possessions as floodwater seeped into homes in Girton.

There are currently two flood alerts in place for east England, 21 alerts in other regions and one flood warning in Wales.

The flooding came after last month was the wettest June in the UK since records began in 1910, provisional figures from the Met Office showed.

Heavy rainfall is expected across the UK for the next month, forecasters have said.
