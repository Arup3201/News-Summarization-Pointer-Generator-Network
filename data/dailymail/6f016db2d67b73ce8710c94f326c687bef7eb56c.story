A 19-year-old from New Jersey pleaded not guilty Friday to shooting dead a 12-year-old girl as she rode home on a scooter last Saturday.Â 

Jhymiere Moore told the court he had been nowhere near the crime scene but handed himself in after hearing that others believed he was responsible for Genesis Rincon's death.

Friends and family of the schoolgirl, who died from a shot to the head, filled the Paterson courtroom as Moore pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and weapons charges.

Tragic: Genesis Rincon died after being hit by a stray bullet as she headed home on Saturday

Genesis had been on her way home with two other children when she was hit by a stray bullet at about 8.40pm. Police believe she was not the intended victim.

Surrender: Moore, 19, handed himself in to police after rumors that he was involved. He denied being the gunman

Moore, who is being held in protective custody at the jail, handed himself in on Tuesday after growing speculation in his neighborhood that he was involved.

'Rather than make it appear that he had 
some culpability or was in some way responsible for this, he took it 
upon himself to say, "I am not guilty, I am not responsible for that 
tragedy, and I want to be an active member in this criminal justice 
system. I'm not going to become a second victim in this tragedy",' his lawyer, Harley Breite, said.

He added that no weapon was found in Moore's possession and claimed the 19-year-old, who has been charged with murder, was being used as a scapegoat for the city's crime problem.

Two other men were charged in connection with the shooting Friday, according to police.

Jeffrey Ellerbee, 21, and Marshae Anthony 19, were charged after unspecified information about the case was received, according to CBS New York.

Ellerbee was charged with first-degree murder, and both men faced charges of unlawful possession of a weapon.

Crime scene: Police investigate the street where Genesis was shot by a stray bullet

A few hours after they watched Moore make his not guilty plea in court, the family of Genesis gathered for her funeral.

Her father, Alexis Rincon, told CBS New York: 'My daughter was a great, great child. My daughter was a great child.'

The 12-year-old was kept on life support after being hit by the bullet, but died on Sunday afternoon.

Genesis had been at a family gathering Saturday night when she, another girl and a boy 
left to go to a nearby store, but they turned back after discovering it 
was closed.

They
 trio was passing the scooter back and forth about a block from the get 
together when the shots rang out, police said. Genesis immediately 
collapsed and lying unresponsive on the ground.

The shooting happened in front of Melvin Simpson's home.

'I am very much upset, especially right here,' he told WABC. 'I'm very much upset about it.'

Tributes: The 12-year-old's family praised Genesis for her loving nature

Simpson called Rincon a 'nice young girl' and said 'it hurts... it could be my kids.'

Alexis Rincon wrote a painful goodbye to her cousin on Facebook.

'My
 life my soul my everything I love her. I don't know what type of animal
 would do something to her. She was a loving person she knows that we 
all love her.'
