A 12-year-old boy from Benton County, Washington, shot dead his 16-year-old sister before turning the gun on himself in what police are now calling a murder-suicide.

Kaitlin Austin, 16, and Ethan Austin, 12, were discovered dead in June in their home on West 3rd Street in Hansen Park.

The coroner’s office has determined that the sister died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head and torso, while her younger brother died from a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

According to the medical examiner, there was no evidence that another person was involved in the shootings.

Drew Austin, Ethan's biological father and Kaitlin’s stepfather, came home at around 5pm on June 9 and made the grisly discovery. One of his registered guns was found near the bodies.

On Friday, investigators released new details about the killings, shedding some light on the family tragedy, but there is still no word on a possible motive.

Scott Johnson, an attorney hired by the Austin family, told the Tri-City Herald that everything appeared normal on the day of the murder-suicide.

The weapon used in the killing was a handgun owned by Drew Austin. The firearm had been locked in a safe, to which Ethan had access.

The 12-year-old was a Boy Scout and an avid hunter who was allowed to handle weapons when supervised by adults. According to his Facebook page, he bagged himself a deer last fall.

Johnson said Ethan was not suffering from any mental health problems and was not taking any medications.

Toxicology test results showed that drugs and alcohol played no role in the incident.

The lawyer added that there was no indication that there had been animosity between the brother and sister.

By all accounts, the Austins were a tight-knit family who enjoyed spending time together.

Kaitlin Austin was a junior at Kamiakin High School, where she was an honor student and softball star. In her obituary, the 16-year-old was described as a 'happy young lady' who was best friends with her mother, Cyndi.

Ethan Austin attended Desert Hills Middle School and was described as a young outdoorsman who loved hunting, archer, camping and golfing. He was also a member of a local Presbyterian church.

'He was the kind of son you would always hope her,' his obituary stated.
