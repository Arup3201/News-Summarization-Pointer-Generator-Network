Pardon: Lucille McLauchlan, 47, was 33 when she was freed from a Saudi sentence to eight years and 500 lashes

A British nurse who spent more than a year in a Saudi Arabian jail for helping to murder a colleague was on life support last night after suffering a brain haemorrhage.

Lucille McLauchlan, 47, was sentenced to eight years and 500 lashes by a Saudi court in 1997 as an accessory to the murder of fellow nurse Yvonne Gilford and for the theft of her bank card, but was freed after a royal pardon.

On Sunday, her son Zak, 14, discovered her unconscious at the family home in Broughty Ferry, near Dundee.

She was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.

Last night it emerged that McLauchlan had suffered a ‘catastrophic’ brain haemorrhage.

It is understood she is being kept on life support while organ transplant arrangements are made.

McLauchlan and fellow nurse Deborah Parry, 54, from Alton, Hampshire, hit the headlines in 1996 after Saudi police arrested them in a shopping mall.

McLauchlan was trying to withdraw money from a cash machine using Miss Gilford’s bank card.

McLauchlan admitted stealing the bank card and allegedly claimed Parry had stabbed Miss Gilford, 55, after the Australian told her their lesbian relationship was over.

Parry confessed too.

The pair later said they had falsely confessed after being tortured, but they were sentenced by the Saudi court and Parry was given the death penalty.

However, in a humanitarian gesture by King Fahd, they were freed after 17 months in jail and flew home in May 1998.
