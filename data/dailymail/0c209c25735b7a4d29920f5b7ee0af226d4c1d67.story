Labour grandees were accused of showing contempt for the public last night after they dismissed calls for an EU referendum.

Arch-Europhiles, some in the pay of Brussels, rejected calls for a vote as the House of Lords debated plans to enshrine in law David Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum in 2017.

Former European Commissioner Lord Mandelson, who will get a lucrative pension from Brussels at 65, said politicians should not entrust the public with an in-out vote on the EU as the outcome would be a lottery.

Lord Mandelson, Labour's former Business Secretary, said Britain¿s EU membership is 'absolutely fundamental' and must not be put 'in the hands' of an unpredictable referendum

Lord Kinnock, whose family is reported to have received £10million in pay, perks and pension entitlements while he and his wife Glenys worked in Brussels, attacked the plans as an appeasement to Eurosceptics.

They spoke in a seven-hour Lords debate on a Private Member’s Bill, introduced by Tory MP James Wharton, which sailed through the Commons after Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg declined to block it.

But Labour and Liberal Democrat peers 
yesterday launched a coordinated assault. The Bill passed its second 
reading without a vote – the convention in the Lords – but critics are 
now expected to table hundreds of amendments in a bid to derail it.

The Bill was introduced into the Lords by
 Tory Lord Dobbs, who said: ‘Nobody below the age of 60 has ever had a 
chance to have a say on this issue. This Bill is needed and it is very 
much wanted.

‘A referendum is about democracy. It is not about being in Europe, it about allowing people to decide their own future. It would be a brave man who denies them that choice – and an even braver unelected peer.’

House of Cards creator Lord Dobbs missed the Golden Globes to battle for an EU referendum.

The
 best-selling author of the acclaimed political thriller is leading 
piloting the EU referendum Bill through the House of Lords.

The
 trilogy House of Cards featured scheming Chief Whip Francis Urquhart 
plotting the downfall of his rivals in the Commons to become Prime 
Minister.

It became a hit 
miniseries for the BBC in 1990s and last year was remade by the US with 
Kevin Spacey playing central character, House Majority Whip Frank 
Underwood.

The series won three Emmys and this weekend is nominated for four Golden Globes including best TV series.

However,
 Lord Dobbs will not be in Beverley Hills for Sunday's ceremony, because
 today's EU debate did not give him time to travel.

Ahead
 of the debate he said: 'I'm about to make the biggest speech of my life
 (or at least since the one I made proposing to my wife).

'I
 am the sponsor of the EU Referendum Bill that is designed to give 
everyone a vote on our membership of the European Union at some point in
 2017. It's hugely important. It's time for the people to decide.'

But Lord Mandelson told the BBC: ‘Membership of the EU is absolutely fundamental to British interests and therefore we should be very wary about putting our interests in the hands of a lottery.’

In the Lords, he said Mr Cameron had been ‘taken hostage by the militant tendency’ of the Tory party. When he left Brussels, Lord Mandelson received £234,000 ‘top-up’ salary payments and a £15,000 resettlement fee. Under the terms of his pension he has to continue to show a ‘duty of loyalty to the Communities’.

The BBC was accused of ‘unbelievable bias’ over Europe yesterday after a presenter branded a referendum a ‘charade’ and suggested it would be ‘stupid’ to give the public a say.

Radio 4 broadcaster Evan Davis was accused of repeatedly interrupting Tory Lord Dobbs on the Today show but let Labour’s Lord Mandelson twice speak for almost two minutes.

Mr Davis also predicted a Labour victory in 2015 that made a Bill over the referendum pointless.

Downing Street complained, but the BBC last night said it was ‘satisfied’ its coverage was fair and balanced.

Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Peter Mandelson thinks that the British people can’t be trusted. He believes the European political elites know best.’

Former mandarins and pro-EU politicians condemned the Bill in the Lords. Lord Kinnock said that, when elected Tory leader, Mr Cameron had pleaded with his party to stop ‘banging on’ about Europe.

‘Mr Cameron’s appeal to stop the “banging on” has been greeted daily by the war drums of the unyielding Europhobes inside, and UKIP outside, his party, and to the detriment of our country, he has pranced to their rhythm,’ Lord Kinnock said.

But former Labour Foreign Secretary Lord Owen, who now sits as a crossbencher, said that while the Bill was a gimmick it was essential to placate the public. And former Tory Chancellors Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson said Britain’s future did not lie in the EU.

The Bill must still go through committee, report and third reading stages in the Lords before returning to the Commons. Because it is a Private Member’s Bill, it  can be heard only during Friday sessions – the last of which in the Commons in this Parliamentary session is February 28 – but senior Tory sources say they will not let  it be killed off.

Gosh, the Establishment Europhiles were worried. Cross, too. They had been asked to look at a Tory Bill for a referendum on the European Union. On a Friday! What a blazing affront. Fridays are for doing the crossword at home.

Fridays are for martinis before lunch, canasta and filling in one’s parliamentary expenses claims.

They certainly aren’t for discussing our possible departure from the greatest gravy boat of all time, the ultimate bateau de jus, le grand paquebot de sauce bearnaise, the European Union.

David Cameron has ordered all Conservative MPs to back legislation paving the way for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union to take place by the end of 2017

These pro-Brussels lordships considered the Bill both tyrannous and trifling. It was dangerous but it was also ‘otiose’. Yes. That was the word. ‘Otiose’.

A very House of Lords word. Isn’t it a beaut’? It means ‘functionless, futile, superfluous’. So why do they complain about it? If something is truly otiose, it can be ignored. The foot-stamping protestations of a railway passenger left on the platform as the train pulls out of the station are otiose.

Yet the Europhiles were not ignoring this Bill. Ooooh no.

Queued up, they did, the former Foreign Office grandees, the failed MPs, the onetime MEPs and European Commission officials and quangoland worthies who nowadays fill the increasingly rotten Upper House, to moan like the Greek chorus in an amateur production of Aeschylus.

Worried about the hoi polloi? Lord Mandelson was one of those leading the way against a referendum

‘Otiose,’ said Spanish-flavoured Lord Garel-Jones (Con). ‘Otiose’ said Lord Oakeshott (Lib Dem).

Lord Davies of Grantham, the ex-Tory MP who defected to Gordon Brown’s government (was a peerage part of the deal?) used words such as ‘squalid’ and ‘scandalous’.

Lord Richard (Lab), once a grand fromage of the European Commission, was a living bifurcation of ennui and vexation, disdain and dismay brought together in the same vinaigrette bottle and given a brisk shaking.

It did not help that someone had forgotten to put old Richard on the list of peers to speak. There was apparently much behind-the-scenes harrumphing. Then someone noticed that Lord Bichard’s name had been included by mistake, so maybe one of the clerks misread Richard’s handwriting and put down Bichard instead. The mistake was rectified.

Lord Richard, who wasted a quarter of an hour at the start on a silly (I nearly said otiose) procedural point, complained that the House was being asked to rush the Bill. This was a line of argument used by other Europhiles.

That absurd and actually unpleasant man Lord Foulkes (Lab WC Fields lookalike) gave a warning that he had cleared all his coming Fridays. This was a coded way of saying that he may try to talk out the Bill.

Lord Strathclyde (Con), making his first speech since stepping down as Leader of the House, said it would be a truly bad idea for an unelected House to try to prevent the people of Britain having a vote on Europe. The Europhiles ignored him.

Lord Wigley (Plaid Cymru), one of those who promised to subject the Bill to as much scrutiny as he could manage, said ‘I am as passionately pro-European as I am committed to Wales’. Given that Lord Wigley is reputed to sleep in a pair of pyjamas printed with the red dragon, and that his home’s loo chain may well ring ‘Land Of My Fathers’ every time it is yanked, this was quite a declaration.

The Bill was put by its proposer, Lord Dobbs (Con), author of House of Cards. Labour’s Opposition was led by Lord Liddle, whose wife used to be No 3 at the BBC (she left with a stonking payout).

Liddle was onetime Brussels bag carrier to Lord Mandelson. Mandy himself spoke, as did Lord Kinnock, another ex-EU Commissioner. What an acidic speech he gave, attacking Eurosceptics as ‘Europhobes’.

Did we hear these Brussels pensioners declare their continuing financial interests? We did not.

The best speech was from former Foreign Secretary Lord Owen (Crossbencher), who said that a referendum was now the ‘settled will’ of the people.

But it is not the settled will of former Foreign Office wallahs such as Lord Hannay, who wanted foreigners in Britain to be given a vote in the referendum. Eh? The drawling, patronising Europhiles intend to fight and fight dirty.

They hate the idea of giving hoi polloi their say. They may well block this Bill.

But their stubbornness will only help David Cameron delineate positions and will only increase public anger with the EU – and this House of Lords.

I started watching the debate uncertain how I might vote in a referendum.

The more I listened to these imperious Europhiles, the more I leaned towards the exit.
