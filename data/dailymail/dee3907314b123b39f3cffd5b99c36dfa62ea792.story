Certain parts of England have twice as many immigrants as previously thought, revised figures have suggested.

There are three times more foreigners in one part of Lincolnshire than previously estimated, while areas in Herefordshire and London have twice as many immigrants.

Revised figures from the Office of National Statistics, published this week by the Greater London Authority, have increased the population of London by 130,000, while its immigrant community has gone up by 16 per cent to nearly 950,000.

The ONS currently measure the number of immigrants in Britain through voluntary questionnaires filled out at airports and ports

In Boston, Lincolnshire, new statistics show that the number of immigrants in the past five years has trebled to 7,500.

While some areas have increased their foreign community as a result of the methodology change, other council areas have seen the number reduced by as much as half.

Cambridge, Norwich and Durham all saw their immigrant community numbers reduced.

The number of foreigners coming to live, study or work in Britain is currently based on a questionnaire which is filled in at airports and ports, while detailed estimates of where new arrivals settle have been calculated in different ways.

The methodology employed by the ONS 
sees migrants separated into 'streams', depending on their age and 
employment status, and their movements are followed using education, 
welfare and health registers.

The revised totals, as published by the GLA, have highlighted an apparent shift in the spread of immigrants across the capital

In Newham, east London, there was a 102 per cent rise in the number of immigrants, while Herefordshire (180 per cent) and Aylesbury Vale (104 per cent), also recorded sharp rises.

Overall, the estimated number of immigrants arriving for more than 12 months between 2006 and 2010 decreased by 0.4 per cent, to just over 2.5million, under the new system.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, told the Telegraph: 'The impact of immigration on London has been revised up by 130,000 to very nearly one million in just five years.

'This is a measure of the huge churn in our population as a result of mass immigration which has serious consequences for our schools, housing and health services.'

The revised ONS figures have not been officially adopted by the Government and have not yet affected local funding levels, partly because more reliable population data will soon be available from the recent census.
