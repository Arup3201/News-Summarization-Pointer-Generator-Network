From ski hire to hotels and expensive snow-proof clothing, the costs involved in taking the family skiing can really stack up.

Now supermarket chain Aldi has come to the rescue with a range of budget ski gear, that includes £35 jackets and £30 trousers.

Indeed, so cheap is the Ski Pro range, the supermarket claims that a family of four can be completely kitted out for just £160.

The range challenges the perception that winter sports are expensive, with the firm claiming to save Brits everywhere a fortune

By contrast, a single men's Blade Jacket from ski brand KJus will set you back an eye-watering £1,220, while jackets from Superdry's Snow range can cost up to £224.99.

Snow trousers from the same range cost £124.99, making an entire outfit an expensive £300 more than Aldi's offering.  

Aldi's budget range also includes all the accessories for your time on the slope, with technical gloves priced at just £4.99 and goggles from £7.99.

'Skiing is costly, especially if it's something the whole family enjoys,' commented John Hill, editor of the Good Ski Guide. 

Equivalent products for winter sports from popular brand Superdry cost considerably more 

The Superdry jacket, by no means the most expensive on the market, is still vastly more than the Aldi one

'Aldi has launched a range that offers best value on the high street with comparable quality to mainstream brands.'

Experienced skier Ollie Morris, 23, who visits the French Alps at least twice every winter, was impressed with the range.

The IT consultant, from Watford, Herts, said: 'I've never come across quality ski gear being sold on the high street for so little.'

As well as the Pro range, Aldi has also launched a Specialbuys Ski range which does thermals at bargain prices, including socks for just £1.99.

An adult can dress for little over £100 with jackets and trousers costing £34.99 and £29.99 respectively

Adult Fleece Hat/Gloves/Scarf - £2.49

Adult M/L Ski Tops - £4.99 

Adult M/L Technical Ski Gloves - £4.99 

Ski & Snowboard Goggles - £7.99 

Ladies’ Plush Fleece Jacket - £12.99 

Adult Winter Boots - £15.99

Salopettes - £16.99

Ski/Snowboard Helmet - £19.99

Softshell Ski Jacket - £24.99

Ski Pro Lite Shell Jacket - £39.99

Ski Pro Lite Shell Trousers - £34.99

A family of four can dress head to toe for £160 with £19.99 ski jackets and £16.99 salopettes available for adults.

Factor in the fact a thermal top costing £3.99, gloves costing 9.99 pounds and socks valued at £3.99 and mothers and fathers can hit the slopes for £54.95 each.

Each child then costs £24.96  to kit out - with ski wear at £14.99, socks at £1.99, gloves at £2.99 and thermal wear costing £4.99.

Even little ones can join in, with infant snowsuits starting at £9.99.

'The Aldi Specialbuys ski range takes the premium price tag out of what is considered a premium sport,' added Mr Hill.

 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer our customers the opportunity to stock up for less without compromising on quality,' said Tony Baines, Joint Managing Director for Corporate Buying at Aldi.

'The new Pro range is no exception. It enables more experienced skiers the chance to purchase excellent quality and affordable gear, as well as breaking down the cost of skiing for beginners and families up and down the country.'
