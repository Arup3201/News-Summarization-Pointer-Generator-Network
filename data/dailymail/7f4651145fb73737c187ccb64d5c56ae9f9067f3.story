Searching through tangles of lights to find the broken one that has left the Christmas tree in the dark is enough to bring out the Scrooge in anyone when decorating for the festive season.

However new technology promises to put an end to this annual vexation.

Engineers have designed the first wireless Christmas lights that are powered using a magnetic field created around the tree.

Bright idea! The new lights uses LED lights, contained within decorative baubles, that can be powered using resonant inductive coupling in a similar way to the method that is used to recharge electric toothbrushes

When the bulbs are placed inside the magnetic field they light up and they can also be controlled through an app on a smart phone like an iPhone or tablet.

The new lights have been built to sit inside decorative baubles that can be placed anywhere on the tree and the designers claim they will last  20 years longer than traditional Christmas lights.

Christopher Higgins, 29, co-founder of Powered by Aura, the California-based company behind the new lights, said: 'This is really a brand new technology and there is nothing quite like it.

'I was inspired to make it because of the amount of wires that suffocate and weigh trees down.'

Mr Higgins unveiled the design on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter, where he hopes to raise enough money to begin producing commercial in time for Christmas 2015.

The lights work by placing a magnetic coil around the trunk of the Christmas tree. 

A magnetic coil placed around the tree trunk produces a magnetic field that only lights up the bulbs when enter the field. The company behind the technology say the ring can power up to 100 lights 

The lights use LEDs bulbs printed onto circuit boards capable of converting a magnetic field into electricity

For trees shorter than five feet this can be placed around the base while for larger trees it needs to be placed in the middle of the foliage, according to the designers.

The lights use LED bulbs that can then convert the magnetic field produced by the coil into electrical energy to power the lights, a process known as resonant inductive coupling.

The approach is similar to that used to recharge the batteries in electric toothbrushes. 

Mr Higgins said their Aura Power Ring can power lights on Christmas trees of all shapes and sizes up to around 10 feet tall. 

The ring also connects to phones, tablets or laptops using WiFi, allowing homeowners to turn their lights on and off, or even to set up a schedule for when they want them to shine.

The Aura power ring can produce a magnetic field up to 10 feet tall to power the lights and can be placed around the base of trees shorter than five feet or in the middle of the foliage of taller Christmas trees

The bulbs could save having to wrestle with tangles of Christmas tree lights when decorating next year

Mr Higgins added: 'This uses no batteries, no wires. It's completely different to anything seen before.

'The ornaments receive power from the base ring by being specially constructed and tuned to only communicate with the base ring itself.

'You can set up any kind of schedule for the lights - such as simple on and off toggling to specific times.

'You can even set up a schedule for dates you want the tree to start and stop lighting up.'

The lights come in three different styles - clear glass, crackle glass and frosted glass.

All styles are available in white and multicolour and the power ring is also available in two sizes - 42 inches wide or 30 inches. Prices for the ring and bulbs start at £45.

Currently the company has received around $32,000 (£20,400) of backing on Kickstarter.

The lights will come in a variety of colours and designs including frosted glass, crackle white glass, clear

Owners can also control their lights by turning the power ring on and off over WiFi from an app on their phone
