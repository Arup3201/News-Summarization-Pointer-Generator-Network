Arnold Schwarzenegger has insisted he was not responsible for exposing prisoners to a lifelong and crippling disease while he was the governor of California

Arnold Schwarzenegger has insisted he was not responsible for exposing prisoners to a lifelong and crippling disease while he was the governor of California.

The Terminator actor, along with a number of other officials, is being sued by dozens of current and former inmates who allege they contracted Valley Fever while being held in prisons in central California.

The illness, caused by a soil-borne fungus, can cause skin lesions and brain damage in sufferers.

The inmates, who claim officials knew of the dangers of keeping inmates in the prisons, are now seeking money to cover medical care and damages.

But in new legal documents, Schwarzenegger has claimed he is not responsible for an outbreak of the illness at Pleasant Valley State Prison, TMZ has reported.

Inmates have accused Schwarzenegger of being indifferent to the risks, a charge the former governor refutes, saying he even held a press conference acknowledging the issue.

Schwarzenegger has also said others were responsible for solving the problems while he was running the state, TMZ has reported.

In court documents, the inmates allege the defendants 'knew that placing inmates in prisons where the prevalence of spore-laden soils was a known hazard - where Valley Fever was already occurring at epidemic rates - posed an unacceptable risk of irreparable harm to them.'

The document goes on to say: 'Yet Defendants not only placed Plaintiffs in harm's way, they also failed to implement even rudimentary measures recommended by the correctional authority's own medical experts to protect Plaintiffs from the disease.'

The current Governor of California, Jerry Brown, is also among those who are being sued.

In February, the federal health care agency reported that three employees at two California prisons had died in recent years and 103 others were made sick by Valley Fever.

Employees at Avenal and Pleasant Valley state prisons near Fresno appear more likely to contract the condition than adults in the surrounding population, the report by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health said.

The institute found that the employee deaths and illnesses occurred between January 2009 and last June.

The state requested the report after 
nearly three-dozen inmate deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations at the
 prisons were blamed on the fungus that causes the illness.

A federal judge ordered the state to move nearly 2,600 inmates to other prisons last fall because those inmates were deemed to be more susceptible to the fungus, which grows naturally in the soil in the Central Valley and other dry locations such as Arizona and Mexico.

Pleasant Valley State Prison in Fresno County had 3,358 inmates and more than 1,300 guards and other employees last May. The institute confirmed 65 valley fever cases among the prison's employees over the 3 1/2-year period of its study, including two employee deaths.

Avenal State Prison in Kings County had 4,538 inmates and more than 1,500 employees last May. The institute confirmed 38 valley fever cases there, with one death. It had an average rate of 511 cases per 100,000, higher than the average of 110 cases per 100,000 adults in Kings County.
