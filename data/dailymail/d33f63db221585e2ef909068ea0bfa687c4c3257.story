One of the most authoritative anti-doping figureheads has blasted the governing body of global athletics, the IAAF, for failing to act upon serious allegations of systemic state doping in Russian sport first revealed 16 months ago by this newspaper.

Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said. ‘I don’t find it surprising they didn’t respond to your report. I find it sadly typical.’

The allegations resurfaced this week, as German TV station ARD and French sports paper L’Equipe reported Russia’s Liliya Shobukhova, who came first in the London marathon before being stripped of the title, had paid €450,000 (£355,000) to the Russian athletics federation.

ARD also showed Olympic 800m champion Maria Savinova admitting to doping, and reported that coaches, athletes and even the anti-doping authorities are involved in doping and cover-ups. The Russian Athletics Federation has called the ARD claims ‘lies’.

In light of the ARD allegations, the IAAF say an investigation is already ongoing, without providing any detail.

Pound added: ‘If the allegations are proved with sufficient certainly, the IAAF, WADA and IOC could say the Russians are non-compliant (with the WADA code) and that they’re suspended from all competitions until they clean up.

‘What I don’t know is if there are sufficient balls within these organisations to make that happen.’
