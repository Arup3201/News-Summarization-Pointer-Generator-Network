Nigel Farage could face punishment from the elections watchdog after he failed to declare £200,000 worth of donations over more than a decade.

The UKIP leader received free use of an office in West Sussex from 2001, but did not register the gift with the Electoral Commission until last month.

Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, regulated recipients - including MEPs like Mr Farage - must report gifts within 30 days of accepting them.

Nigel Farage could be fined up to £20,000 for failing to declare £200,000 worth of donations over 10 years 

Penalties for not complying can include fines of up to £20,000 and, in the most extreme cases, a 12-month prison term.

Mr Farage finally registered the use of the premises, a small converted farm building near Littlehampton, in a declaration to the Electoral Commission last month after it wrote to him.

He stated that the gift from supporter John Longhurst had been worth £205,602 over 13 years.

The Electoral Commission is now considering whether to take actions against the party leader.

A spokesman said: ‘Clearly the donations should have been reported to us, and now have been following our correspondence with Nigel Farage.

‘At the moment, our Party Finance team is reviewing all of the necessary information supplied to us by Mr Farage and are considering it carefully. Once this process is complete we will take a decision on whether any further action against him is necessary.’

Former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom today advised Mr Farage to be 'a little more circumspect' about his closeness to women

Mr Farage today claimed the gift had already been registered with authorities in Brussels.

A UKIP spokesman said: ‘Every year since 2001, Mr Farage has declared in his European Parliament Register of Interests the use of a rent-free office from J Longhurst Ltd.

‘The premises has been used as his MEP office so the European Parliamentary register was the logical place for it to be declared.

‘Mr Farage was surprised to learn that the Electoral Commission thought it should be informed as well as this did not accord with the professional advice he had received at the time.’

It came as controversial former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom yesterday said that Mr Farage should be ‘a little more circumspect’ about his closeness to women.

He said the Ukip leader needed to be careful after he was last week photographed returning to his hotel with a woman at 3am.

Mr Bloom who resigned from the party last year after a number of outspoken remarks, told the BBC’s Daily Politics: ‘I think perhaps if I was his old dad I’d say be a little more circumspect, but that’s the pot calling the kettle black with me.’

The 64-year-old, who shared a flat in Brussels with Mr Farage for several years, stepped down after he referred to women as ‘sluts’ and struck a journalist on the street.

He earlier attracted claims of racism by denouncing aid being sent to 'bongo bongo land'.

Mr Bloom said he was still friends with Mr Farage. He said: ‘We had a sherbet the other day. I think you can fall out in politics or professionally without having to scratch each other eyes out.’
