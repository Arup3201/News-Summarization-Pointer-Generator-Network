A former defence minister has threatened to derail David Cameron’s promise to guarantee a rising foreign aid budget.

Sir Gerald Howarth said if the Prime Minister backs a law forcing the Government to spend high amounts on foreign aid, then backbench Tories will demand a similar pledge on defence spending.

The aid law, which has passed its second reading in the Commons and is now due to go to committee stage, would compel future governments to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid.

This would mean further rises in the foreign aid budget, which has already reached £12billion a year.

Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, said Tory opponents will attempt to amend the Bill so it also commits Britain to spending two per cent of national income on defence.

As a Nato member, Britain is currently required to spend that exact percentage of our income on defence. But so far the Government has not committed to do so beyond 2016.

Sir Gerald said: ‘This Bill is the sort of thing that drives traditional Conservative supporters to Ukip.

‘People wonder, what is the Prime Minister doing? They do not get why he is promising to spend billions more on aid while he is making soldiers redundant.’

The warning came after a report by the TaxPayers’ Alliance found that British aid ‘does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries’.

The report examined the progress of 28 countries which have received British taxpayers’ money, measuring the impact of aid spending against benchmarks laid down by international organisations.

These included the Heritage Foundation, which published a measure of trade and property freedom, and Freedom In The World, which measures political and civil liberties.

Out of the countries which received British aid, 12 showed no changes in their measured levels of economic and political freedoms over a decade.

Six countries had a falling score while just three – Nepal, Rwanda and Tanzania – had freedom levels that improved with increasing aid.

Four countries – Ghana, Paraguay, Peru and Zambia – had improved freedom scores even though the amount of aid they received from Britain went down. Russia, which ceased to get UK aid in 2011, had a falling score, and Ukraine’s share of British aid money went down while its measured levels of freedom stayed much the same.

The report said: ‘International organisations are critical in the global effort to tackle poverty, but the Department for International Development, recipient governments and non-governmental organisations must not push donor governments into believing that financial inputs are more important than actual outcomes.’

Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, said Tory opponents will attempt to amend the Bill so it also commits Britain to spending two per cent of national income on defence

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Too often, British taxpayers’ money is spent propping up governments that refuse to grant fundamental freedoms.

‘The arbitrary spending target of 0.7 per cent so loved by politicians means money is spent for the sake of it, rather than for any obvious need.’

But a spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Britain promotes freedom by backing fair elections, a free press and individual rights, and we should be proud of that.’
