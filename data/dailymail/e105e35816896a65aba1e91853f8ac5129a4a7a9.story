The multi-billion pound industry built on vexatious discrimination claims against employers has virtually collapsed, it emerged yesterday.

Employment tribunal cases have dropped by three-quarters over the past year, with sex discrimination claims down by 80 per cent and race claims by 60 per cent.

The spectacular decline follows a simple reform introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last summer – the charging of fees to workers who want to make a claim against their employer.

The charge, which is £1,200 for discrimination claims, is reimbursed to employees who win. But the threat of losing this money appears to have deterred the majority of those who would once have been tempted to claim.

In the first six months of the new fees system, the number of claims to employment tribunals dropped from 109,425 to 20,678.

This fall of nearly 90,000 is a major boost for businesses, which were previously spending around £1.6billion a year in defence costs. There were 191,000 employment claims in the financial year to March 2013.

Around one in five businesses were thought to have been threatened, with the average defence costing £8,500 and compensation to employees who won averaging £10,000 each.

The scale of the collapse was highlighted by the TUC in a report on the impact of the new fees. Trade union leaders argued the reform has meant ‘a huge victory for Britain’s worst bosses’.

TUC chief Frances O’Grady said: ‘By charging up-front fees for harassment and abuse claims the Government has made it easier for bad employers to get away with the most appalling behaviour.’

But there was satisfaction among ministers and business leaders, who believe the system was regularly abused by vexatious claimants, including serial litigants trying to win thousands of pounds for spurious complaints.

The consequences of vexatious claims 
are most serious for small businesses, which can rarely afford to launch
 a robust defence. Prior to the new system, claims had more than doubled
 since the year 2000, when there were around 80,000 a year.

The
 fees, introduced at the end of July last year, range from £390 for a 
straightforward claim over unfair dismissal or a failure to pay wages, 
to £1,200 for sex or race discrimination. But poor claimants can have 
the fees reduced, or even waived.

'Employment tribunals should always be the last resort in an employment dispute as they can be stressful, time consuming and expensive for all parties'

John Allan, Federation of Small Businesses

If the claimant wins, the tribunal normally orders the employer to reimburse the fees.

The TUC report, based on Ministry of Justice figures, said sex discrimination claims went from 6,017 in the three months to March 2013 to just 1,222 in the same three months this year.

The figures also showed there were 584 claims of race discrimination in July 2013. By January this year the number had fallen to 157.

Equal pay claims also saw a large decline, from 3,654 in March 2013 to 574 in March this year.

John Allan of the Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the changes, saying: ‘Employment tribunals should always be the last resort in an employment dispute as they can be stressful, time consuming and expensive for all parties.’

Justice Minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘It is reasonable to expect people to pay towards the £74million bill taxpayers face for providing the service.’

Defeated: Apprentice winner Stella English

Business tycoon Lord Sugar furiously denounced a ‘vexatious’
claim brought against him at an employment tribunal by a winner of his reality
TV show, The Apprentice.

Stella English, 35, claimed that after she won a
£100,000-a-year role with one of Lord Sugar’s companies she was given a non-job
from which she felt forced to resign.

She lost her constructive dismissal case last April, when
the tribunal ruled her allegations of unfair treatment ‘should never have been
brought’.

Lord Sugar said: ‘This case was a sham and a total abuse of
a tribunal system which is there to protect employees ... it is not there to
aid those chancing their arm at landing a big payday.’

Department store John Lewis was also the subject of a
tribunal claim after a staff member said he had been sexually harassed.

Furniture sales assistant Konstantinos Kalomoiris, 40,
complained that his ‘tactile’ colleague Bianca Revrenna routinely slapped his
and other co-workers’ bottoms.

But his claim was dismissed at a tribunal in February 2011
when its chairman, Harjit Grewal, said he had ‘embellished’ his story as he
went along.
