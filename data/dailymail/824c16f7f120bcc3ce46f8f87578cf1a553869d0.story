A hospital in Norway has sacked a Polish cleaner after she was overheard speaking in her mother tongue during work lunch breaks.

Johanna Renclawowicz received a letter saying she was fired from Sykehuset Telemark hospital because 'you have been given information that only Norwegian shall be spoken during working time'.

It continued: 'Your colleagues and hospital users have repeatedly complained that Polish is spoken in the eating area, cleaning department and corridors etc.'

Mrs Renclawowicz was hired as temporary extra help at the hospital in Skien in August last year.

The mother-of-one was one of five Polish cleaners at the hospital and soon after starting was told by a fellow Pole that speaking Polish was banned in the workplace.

She said: 'It was just strange that we were expected to speak Norwegian to each other on our breaks when we’re not that fluent.

'We always tried to speak Norwegian with the Norwegian employees.

'But every time the boss heard one of us speaking Polish, she said, "Speak Norwegian!" She mainly complained if it happened during lunch breaks.'

In January, the hospital’s unit manager began hanging up posters which read: 'At work we talk NORWEGIAN', it is claimed.

Last month, Mrs Renclawowicz received a letter from her unit manager titled 'The use of language in the workplace' in which she was berated for speaking Polish.

The letter added that by not speaking in Norwegian she had created a 'bad working environment'.

Mrs Renclawowicz  was warned that if she continued she would be fired.

She said: 'I contacted the Labour Inspectorate which told me that one cannot be dismissed because they speak in their mother tongue during non-paid meal breaks.

'But when I told this to my unit manager, she said that it was "bulls***" and that she could kick me out when she wanted.

'I have never been treated this way before.'

The college-educated 34-year-old from Warsaw said she and her husband had moved to Norway four years ago to find a better life and now have a three-year-old daughter.

She said: 'We have a child and a mortgage, so I was devastated when I got the sack. My child is just about to start kindergarten too. Their timing was very bad.'

Mrs Renclawowicz said she will now sue the hospital for discrimination and unfair dismissal.

'I will not proceed with the case because of the money, but because it is a matter of principle. I do not want anyone else to be subjected to the same thing.

'It was bad enough to lose my job, but to lose it under such circumstances was particularly stressful.

'In other hospital jobs, and in many other countries, both doctors and nurses talk together in their mother tongue during breaks in the cafeteria.'

She added: 'I worked hard. One of the fellow Polish workers is a good friend of mine. It is normal we speak Polish with each other but when working we always spoke Norwegian as was requested. Just in our lunch breaks people would speak in their mother tongue.'

Her lawyer, Sebastian Garstecki, confirmed she has now taken legal action against Sykehuset Telemark hospital.

She said: 'The hospital has received notification about our case and has two weeks to respond.

'If they don’t we will see them in court. First and foremost, this is a matter of principle.

'The fact is that an employee speaking Polish at work in an unpaid meal break cannot be seen as a gross breach of duty.

'Her dismissal therefore is unlawful.'

Mr Garstecki added that he had also reported the hospital to the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud, noting that the government agency had previously deemed language directives of this kind to constitute discrimination.
