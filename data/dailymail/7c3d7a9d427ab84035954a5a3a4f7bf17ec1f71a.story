If you're lost money on a bet, or overspent this week, spare a thought for Warren Buffett - he has lost $2 billion in two days. 

Mr Buffett, who is known more for making long-term investments, than chasing the quick-buck, holds large chunks of Coke and IBM, both of which dived in value over the last two days.

His Berkshire Hathaway investment house lost $1 billion on Coke - which dropped 6 per cent - yesterday after the company reported earnings below expectations, something its expecting to be repeated next year.

It's not all bad news for Mr Buffett though, with investors sticks with his company where shared climbed on Monday and Tuesday; they are up 17 per cent this year

Mr Buffett owns 400 million shares in the company and his son Howard sits on the beverage company's board.

That loss followed a hard day at the office on Monday, when IBM lost $1.3 billion as the stock plunged. 

The stock dropped 7 per cent on Monday, then dipped again yesterday. It is off nearly 13 per cent so far this year, and Mr Buffett's company holds over 70 million shares, according to CNN Money.

The losses cap off a difficult year for the investor. He bought into Tesco whose value dropped nearly 47 per cent.
