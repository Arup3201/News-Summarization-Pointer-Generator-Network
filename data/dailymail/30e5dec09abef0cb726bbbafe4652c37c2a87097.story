Legendary jockey AP McCoy is hoping to end his career on a high with with victory in the Gold Cup at the Cheltenham Festival. 

Having recently announced his retirement plans for the end of the season, something which McCoy admitted to the BBC he questions 'every morning', the 40-year-old will ride Carlingford Lough for the final time on Friday, looking to add to two previous Gold Cup victories already.

McCoy has previously ridden Carlingford Lough to victory at The Hennessy Gold Cup (2015), Growsie Champion Novice Chase (2014), Fort Leney Novice Chase and Galway Plate (both 2013).

While McCoy might be a reluctant retiree, his decision is probably for the best, given the amount of injuries he has sustained over the past 23 years.  

 The marathon-man has broken his middle and lower vertebrae, both shoulder blades, both collarbones, ribs, ankle, cheekbones, wrist, and leg, to mention numerous chipped teeth and repeated broken fingers. 

The latest odds place Carlingford Lough at 10/1 to win on Friday.
