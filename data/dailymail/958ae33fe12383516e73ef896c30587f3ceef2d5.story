When it comes to New Year resolutions, Mississippi dwellers may have a longer list than most.

The state has been identified as most unhealthy in the country as the annual American Health Rankings reveal its citizens suffer from high levels of obesity, and diabetes, as well as low teen immunization coverage and low birth weight.

For those in Hawaii, Vermont, and Massachusetts, however, you seem to be doing just fine.   

Which state is healthiest? The south and the Midwest remain low on the American Health Ranking list 

Nationally, the 25th annual study recorded a significant increase in adult obesity rates this year from 27.6 per cent in 2013 to 29.4 per cent.

The number of adults who exercise less than once a month also shot up from 22.9 per cent to 23.5 per cent.

However, the number of smokers - which has been steadily diminishing - dropped by another three per cent in 2014, and infant mortality rates notched down four per cent.

For the third year in a row Hawaii, which has never finished lower than sixth since the survey started in 1990, was awarded the top spot for its low rates of smoking, obesity, child poverty, preventable hospitalizations and deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease.

It was followed, in order, by Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Utah, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Colorado, North Dakota and Nebraska. 

National figures: Overall, an increasing number of Americans exercise less frequently than once a month

Rocketing: Obesity figures have continued to climb across the United States since the survey started in 1990

Vermont has not moved from second place since 2011. After two years in fourth place, Massachusetts has celebrated a slight boost.

Meanwhile, southern states continue to record poor health. 

Mississippi, which has never finished higher than 48th, remains in last place for the third year running.

The state ranks well for low prevalence of binge drinking, high immunization coverage among children, and small disparity in health status.

Good news! The number of smokers is continuing to diminish and this year saw another three per cent drop

But it ranks in the bottom 5 states on 16 of the 27 measures including low high school graduation rates and limited doctor or dentist availability.

In 49th place came Arkansas followed by Louisiana at 48 then Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Indiana.

'We applaud hard-won advances in several key measures, including smoking prevalence, even as this year's America's Health Rankings is a solemn reminder that we have a lot more work ahead of us,' said Dr Reed Tuckson, senior medical adviser to the United Health Foundation, a nonprofit arm of insurer United Health Group.
