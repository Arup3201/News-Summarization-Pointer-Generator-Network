Nicola Rizzoli will be able to look back on this final with pride as he performed well as did both of his assistants in a tough match.

In any such game there are incidents to debate; perhaps Sergio Aguero’s challenge on Sebastian Schweinsteiger being the most obvious. The debate could only be whether the Manchester City striker should have seen straight red or his second yellow – either way he was extremely fortunate to finish the game.

Manuel Neuer’s clash with Gonzalo Higuain was compared in commentary to the assault by Harold Schumacher on France’s Battiston in 1982 but for me the winner of this tournaments golden glove was blameless as he stretched to punch the ball away and his momentum caught his opponent.

Calming nature: It was a fine refereeing performance from Nicola Rizzoli on Sunday night

Collision: Sergio Aguero was lucky to stay on the pitch after leading with his arm while on a yellow card

All worth it: Bastian Schweinsteiger was bloodied after a challenge with Sergio Aguero

Ouch: Manuel Neuer clatters into Gonzalo Higuain in the second half... he still earned his team a foul

Perhaps Rizzoli was wrong to give Germany a free kick when a throw-in seemed the right decision but he was under pressure at the time not to be seen to favour the South Americans – balance is vital in such tight affairs.

In fact Rizzoli found the perfect balance all evening and used common sense when dealing with a seemingly concussed Cristoph Kramer. When medical experts tell you he is fine to continue you struggle to differ – perhaps something that FIFA or the IFAB should review.

Rizzoli can certainly sit back in his plane seat back to Bologna and reflect on a great tournament and one in which he did all he could to apply laws even with FIFA restricting the use of disciplinary sanctions – something else that must change before 2018.
