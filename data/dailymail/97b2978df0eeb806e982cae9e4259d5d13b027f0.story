Michael Jackson’s teenage daughter was 'overwhelmed' with teenage turmoil before her attempted suicide on Monday - just weeks before the fourth anniversary of her father’s death.

Paris Jackson, 15, cut her wrists and took a drug overdose, according to reports.

The teenager had become 'overwhelmed’ with sadness over the loss of her superstar father, said a friend of the Jackson family.

She is also in the middle of doing her
 exams at school and is anxious over her looming appearance in court in 
Los Angeles where she is due to testify in a trial connected with 
Jackson’s fatal overdose on June 25, 2009.

In addition, sources said she was upset at not being allowed to go to a concert by goth rocker Marilyn Manson tonight.

She 'threw a fit’ after being told she
 couldn’t attend the concert on a school night and reportedly ran into 
her room screaming and slammed the door.

Paris is going through a difficult 
time and has had 'a lot going on lately’, her mother Debbie Rowe, who 
was pictured speaking to police on Wednesday outside her Palmdale ranch 
in California.

The teen has posted a series of dark messages on Twitter over recent months.

In May she saluted Goth rocker Manson 
on her Twitter page, writing: 'Hey evil world,' while in another from 
that month she refers to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who committed 
suicide in 1994, as 'Jesus.'

In another angst-ridden tweet in 
February she hinted at heartache over a failed relationship, exclaiming:
 'Here's to teenage romances and never knowing why they hurt like hell.'

Perry Sanders, a lawyer for Katherine 
Jackson, the teen’s grandmother added: 'Being a sensitive 15-year-old is
 difficult no matter who you are. It is especially difficult when you 
lose the person closest to you.’ But he continued: 'Paris is physically 
fine and is getting appropriate medical attention.’

The drama unfolded just hours after the teenager posted a series of alarming messages on Twitter.

At around midnight on Tuesday, she 
recited the sorrowful Beatles song Yesterday to her million plus 
followers, writing: 'Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away, now 
it looks as though they’re here to stay.’ An hour previously, she 
posted: 'I wonder why tears are salty.’

Scott Miller of the Los Angeles County
 Fire Department said an emergency call was made from the Jackson family
 compound in Calabasas, California, at 1.27am yesterday 'regarding a 
possible overdose’.

Paris was taken out of the house on a stretcher at 2am and rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital.

According to celebrity website TMZ, a 
source connected to the emergency response said there were multiple cuts
 on one of the victim’s wrists.

'She’s okay,’ a source told the New 
York Daily News, scoffing at the idea that the teen would resort to 
suicide over missing a concert. 'She’s very outgoing and has been 
spending time lately with Debbie and the animals. This is more just a 
kid acting out.’

Bonding: Paris has been getting closer with her mother Debbie Rowe of late, seen here together last month

Katherine Jackson and other family 
members were at Paris’s hospital bedside yesterday. Her life was not 
thought to be in any danger.

Jackson, who died in June 2009 from a lethal dose of surgical anaesthetic propofol, was married to Rowe from 1996 to 1999.

Rowe, 54, met Michael when she was a 
nurse for Dr Arnold Klein, the singer’s dermatologist. The pair had two 
children together, Prince Michael, now 16, in 1997 and Paris in 1998. 
Jackson later had a third child, Prince Michael II, also known as 
Blanket, who is ten.

Rowe turned over full custody of the 
children to Jackson as part of their divorce but she had recently 
rekindled her relationship with Paris. Rowe wouldn’t comment further on 
the incident yesterday.

'We appreciate everyone’s thoughts for
 Paris at this time and their respect for the family’s privacy,’ said 
her lawyer Eric George.

In one tweet earlier this week, Paris,
 who wants to be an actress, put her name forward as a candidate for the
 next Doctor Who, writing 'OMG I wanna be The Doctor.’

But in recent days, her tweets have been increasingly bleak.

On June 1, she tweeted: 'Every time i 
try to distract myself it never works and i end up making the same 
mistake i make every single night.’

The following day she wrote: 'I hate studying alone. i can’t focus…like i just tried studying and now i’m on twitter.’

'Don’t listen to a word i say the 
screams all sound the same,’ she tweeted on Monday from the song Little 
Talks by Of Monsters And Men.

On Sunday, she quoted the lyrics from a
 Zee Avi song Concrete Wall – 'You say I need therapy, well, my darling,
 so do you. Don’t need for you to tell me what is wrong in all I say or 
do.’

The years since Jackson’s death have 
been anything but tranquil for the star’s children as they have faced 
one drama after another. Last year, the turmoil broke into the open when
 Paris and her two brothers were ambushed by the singer’s siblings and 
separated from their grandmother.

Panicked by the infighting, Paris 
tweeted at the time, 'my grandmother is missing. i haven’t spoken with 
her in a week i want her home now.’

It later emerged that Katherine was taken to her oldest daughter Rebbe’s home in Arizona.

Friends said Paris has been battling 
depression since her father’s sudden death. 'It’s very real and very 
sad. She has been extremely depressed and not been able to sleep lately,
 staying up all night,’ an insider told Us magazine.

'She misses her dad constantly and has acted out.’

Paris is listed as a potential witness
 in a £26.5billion lawsuit currently being brought by the Jackson family
 against AEG Live – the promoters behind her father’s doomed London O2 
comeback tour. The wrongful death suit, launched by Katherine Jackson 
and her three grandchildren, says the singer died from an overdose of 
prescription drugs after a punishing schedule of rehearsals prior to the
 tour.

Now in its sixth week, the trial has 
resurrected upsetting details surrounding the death, including the 
star’s dependence on drugs and his frail condition at the time of his 
death.
