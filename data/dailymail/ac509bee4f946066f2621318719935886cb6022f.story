Media mogul Sumner Redstone has reportedly been spending time with the baby that his girlfriend adopted on her own.

The 90-year-old billionaire was not a part of his girlfriend Sydney Holland's adoption of a baby girl in June but apparently he has become a part of the child's life.

Holland, who is less than half her boyfriend's age as she recently turned 42, has been bringing her daughter to Redstone's Beverley Hills mansion.

That isn't his only connection to the little girl, as Holland used him as inspiration for her name: Alexandra Red.

'Sydney spends a lot of time at Sumner’s home, so when she is there, she brings the baby with her. It is her child, and he is not involved in bringing her up,' a source told The New York Post.

People who have seen Holland toting the baby around town are now speculating that perhaps he is the girl's father since she has red hair.

'Could the baby be Sumner's biological child?' an unidentified source wondered to the newspaper.

Redstone has two children from his first marriage, though they are both in their 60s, making them old enough to be the adopted daughter's grandparents as opposed to her hypothetical step-siblings.

For her part, Holland has been very publicly clear that the adoption process was something she knowingly went into alone.

'I recently adopted a baby on my own, and I am very excited to experience both the joys and challenges of motherhood.'

Redstone celebrated his 90th birthday in May with a lavish L.A. party where Tony Bennett performed for a crowd including Mark Wahlberg, Danny DeVito and Tom Cruise.

Now a nonagenarian, he’s reportedly worth $4.7billion, making him Forbes’ 91st richest person in the world.
