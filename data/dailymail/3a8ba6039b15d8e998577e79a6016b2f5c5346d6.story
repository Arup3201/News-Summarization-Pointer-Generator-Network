Labour ministers should have knifed Gordon Brown before the last election, Alistair Darling admitted yesterday, as he  painted a devastating picture  of the former Prime Minister’s ‘appalling behaviour and flawed judgment’.

Mr Darling, one of the few figures to emerge with credit from the last Government, said Mr Brown’s refusal to accept the severity of the economic crisis had wrecked Labour’s hopes of a fourth term in office.

In a new book, Mr Darling said he failed to act against Mr Brown because of ‘residual loyalty’ and a fear that forcing him out without identifying an obvious successor would plunge Labour into  civil war.

But yesterday he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that ministers should have moved against him over his refusal to accept economic reality.

He said: ‘I think we could have done a better job than we did.

‘There were lots of discussions like that – you know, you have a discussion with someone you have a tempestuous relationship with and they say, “We can’t go on like this, we’ll change”, and two hours later we’re back where we were.

‘If you want to criticise us collectively, perhaps we should have done something.’

He said the ‘disagreement at the very top’ had ended Labour’s economic credibility.

He said: ‘If you don’t have a credible economic policy, you are simply not at the races, and our problem was it was so blindingly obvious to the outside world that the two of us, Gordon and myself, were at odds, that it really hampered us when it came to the election of 2010.’

In his book the former Chancellor accused Mr Brown of working in a ‘permanent air of chaos and crisis’.

He said that Mr Brown’s ‘cabal’ operated a ‘fairly brutal regime – and many of us fell foul of it’. He went on: ‘Gordon is not an easy man to work with.

‘He is a man capable of huge gestures of generosity, but he seemed to have no conception of the effects of his sometimes appalling behaviour on those close to him, or of the political damage his way of operating – indirectly, through a cabal – could cause.’ Mr Darling said Mr Brown ‘surrounded himself with a cadre of people whose preoccupation was the removal of Tony Blair’.

The feuding created a ‘cancer’ at the heart of Labour.

He said that when Mr Brown finally removed Mr Blair, he appeared to have little idea what he wanted to do as Prime Minister. ‘It was all about tactics rather than strategy,’ he wrote.

The former Chancellor attacked bankers for failing to grasp the scale of the financial crisis, saying that even as they were teetering on the brink of collapse, they  simply did not understand they would go under without state help on the government’s terms.

He lambasted them for the ‘disdain’ with which they greeted his plan to inject billions of pounds of public money into their institutions.

In an interview with the Sunday Times, he described a make-or-break meeting at 11 Downing Street with bankers, and said: ‘When I told them what we were offering, there was a stunned silence, which I mistook for appreciation. Far from it – they started quibbling. I said to them, “You can take it or leave it, and if you leave it, God help you”.’

Mr Darling also attacked Sir Fred ‘the Shred’ Goodwin, former chief executive of RBS, for having no understanding of the failures at his bank.

On one occasion, Mr Darling said Sir Fred strolled out of a life-and-death rescue meeting ‘as if he were off for a game of golf’.

The Conservatives seized on the revelations and claimed that Labour was still in the grip of Mr Brown’s most loyal advisers.

Tory MP Greg Hands MP said: ‘While the spirit of Gordon Brown lives on within the Labour leadership, the public won’t trust them to run the economy or the country.’

Mr Darling faced a Labour backlash.

Labour education spokesman Andy Burnham said he still had ‘huge respect’ for Mr Brown’s achievements and added: ‘I do not believe it is that helpful to rake over these coals.’

Serious questions: Ed Balls was in total denial about the budget deficit according to Alistair Darling

Ed Balls is facing serious questions about his economic credibility after Mr Darling suggested he and Gordon Brown were in total denial about the budget deficit.

Mr Darling’s memoirs paint a surreal picture of the Labour Government’s handling of the economic crisis, with Mr Brown and his closest lieutenants refusing to accept the scale of the crisis facing Britain.

Mr Brown attempted to replace Mr Darling with Mr Balls in a 2009 reshuffle – and even at one point offered him David Miliband’s job as Foreign Secretary. Mr Darling stood his ground, saying he refused to be ‘trashed and sacrificed’. The move was dropped after James Purnell’s sudden resignation from the Cabinet weakened Mr Brown’s hand.

Mr Balls is now in charge of trying to restore Labour’s economic credibility, but the Tories said the revelations raised fresh questions about his suitability as Shadow Chancellor.

Tory deputy chairman Michael Fallon said: ‘Gordon Brown’s protege Ed Balls is still in denial by sticking to the same course of more spending and more borrowing. And it’s extraordinary that he was putting political plotting ahead of the national interest in the middle of an economic crisis.’

Mr Darling wrote that in the summer of 2008, when the Treasury was warning that Britain faced the worst recession since the Second World War, Mr Brown simply refused to believe it, and began crafting his own economic strategy based on the idea that the downturn would only last six months.

This refusal to accept the need for spending cuts led to ‘pitched battles’ with Mr Darling.

The former Chancellor said his relationship with Mr Brown was ‘driven to breaking point’ in the run-up to the 2009 Budget.

He said: ‘Gordon and I were unable to agree about growth forecasts and strategy; our disagreement can be boiled down to investment in the economy versus the need to cut borrowing. Forty-eight hours before its presentation, we had no Budget. It’s a tribute to the Treasury team that they worked through the night to get the thing done.

‘The tension levels are extraordinary, and this Budget was the worst of my time as chancellor. We were rewriting it literally until the last minute.’

Mr Darling said he was eventually forced to present a budget forecast that ‘simply lacked credibility’.

However Mr Brown pressed on with his claim that the forthcoming election would be fought on the argument of Labour investment versus Tory cuts – a strategy which led to ‘some very angry exchanges’ with his Chancellor.

Mr Darling said: ‘He told me I was undermining him and it had to stop. I certainly was not, I said. Why would I do that? Didn’t he understand that I was trying, desperately, to give him, the government, a realistic platform on which to go forward? I told him we could not continue to argue a case that did not stand up. The evidence was there for all to see.’
