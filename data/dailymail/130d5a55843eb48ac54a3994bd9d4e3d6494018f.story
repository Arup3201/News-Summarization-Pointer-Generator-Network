Landon Donovan has been left out of the USA squad for next month's World Cup in Brazil.

The 32-year-old, who has 156 international caps and 57 goals to his name, has been left out by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, but Sunderland's struggling striker Jozy Altidore has been selected.

It means Donovan will not get the chance to play in his fourth World Cup - a record that would have put him alongside Pele and Bobby Charlton - a tournament in which he has scored as many goals as Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie combined.

Omitted: USA legend Landon Donovan has been left out by Jurgen Klinsmann

Included: Jozy Altidore is going, despite scoring just one Premier League goal all season

Mocked: Klinsmann's son Jonathan tweeted after finding out about Donovan, though he later apologised

In fact, the forward - who has had two loans spells in England with Everton - has more international goals than any other player going to the Brazil except for Didier Drogba and Miroslav Klose.

Donovan released a statement via Facebook on Thursday night expressing his disappointment at Klinsmann's decision.

Alongside Altidore, Premier League stars Tim Howard, Brad Guzan and Geoff Cameron have all made Klinsmann's final 23, as well as other notable names DaMarcus Beasley, Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey.

Klinsmann's son Jonathan then caused more controversy by mocking Donovan on Twitter.

Jonathan,
 a goalkeeper who has been in the USA Under 18s squad, posted: 
HHAHAHAHAHAHAH DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL MY PHONE 
NOTIFIED ME HAHA'.

Message: Seattle Sounders midfielder left this message for Cristiano Ronaldo after not making the squad

He later apologised and deleted his account. 'Yes, I deleted the tweet, Yes, I realize it was VERY classless,' he said. 'But again, My sincerest apologies to everyone who was offended.'

Another midfielder who didn't make the squad was Brad Evans of the Seattle Sounders - though he had a rather more humorous reaction when informed.

He tweeted to Ronaldo: 'You got off easy this time.'

USA start their campaign against Ghana on June 16, before playing Portugal and Germany in their remaining Group G games.

To my fans,

It
 has been an honor and privilege to have represented the US National 
Team in three World Cups. I was looking forward to playing in Brazil 
and, as you can imagine, I am very disappointed with todayâ€™s decision. 
Regardless, I will be cheering on my friends and teammates this summer, 
and I remain committed to helping grow soccer in the US in the years to 
come.

Thanks for all your support,

Landon
