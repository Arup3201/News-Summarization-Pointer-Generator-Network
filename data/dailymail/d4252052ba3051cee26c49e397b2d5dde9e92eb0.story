Initially set 25 years after the events of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate follows the story of Gabriel Belmont's ancestors, and is being released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS.

Trevor Belmont, a knight of the Brotherhood of Light, sets out to avenge the death of his mother, at the hands of his own father, who has now returned from years of exile to take up residence in a mysterious castle.

Gabriel Belmont is now a powerful vampire called Dracula after being corrupted by an ancient evil called The Forgotten One. He's declared war upon the Brotherhood, setting the scene for a showdown between father and son.

We caught up with Dave Cox, producer of the Lords of Shadow saga, and quizzed him about what fans can expect in Mirror of Fate.

1. Tell us about the game. How is the story told?

Cox: 'The plot centres around the blood feud with the Belmont's but this time from Dracula's perspective. The story is told backwards like Chris Nolan's Memento and it's not until the very endÂ  of the game that everything becomes clear.

'We wanted to show that the fate of each character and the choices they make have a direct impact on those closest to them. I think once all is said and done players will have some sympathy with our villain.'

2. The original was a beautiful-looking game, although there were frequent gripes with drops in framerate. What improvements can we expect to see in this version?

Cox: 'This game is very much a combination of the old and the new.It has the modern sensibility of he first game but harks back to the classics in a more cohesive way.

'We want to screw around with player perception, on the surface this looks like a classic side scrolling Castlevania game but look deeper and you will see a very combat focused game that utilises the stereoscopic 3D effects to the max.

'Often we put the camera into the game world and in several places the game is shown as a third person perspective. It's this constant melding of old and new that will surprise players.'

3. Does gameplay stay true to the very first games, or does it follow in Lords of Shadow's footsteps?

Cox: 'This is very much a sequel to Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and in that respect gameplay is consistent with that game.

'It's much more about combat which is deep and intense like the original. Of course, we have incorporated some of the features of the classics and exploration plays a much big role this time.

'In some ways we see this as a spiritual successor to Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse with its multiple characters and branching pathways.'

4. Are there any plans to bring Lords of Shadow to the Wii U?

Cox: 'This game is only planned for 3DS and we have no plans to bring to Wii U.'

5. How long will the game last?

Cox: 'Average playthroughs are around 16 hours but you won't have collected or seen everything the game has to offer. Usually this would take around 20 hours.'

6. What inspired you when designing the levels / beasts?

Cox: 'It's really the classic games from the NES and SNES era in particular the original Castlevania and Dracula's Curse. We often check those designs when redesigning our world.

'We all grew up on those early classics and it's those games that have inspired us in redefining the Castlevania universe.'
