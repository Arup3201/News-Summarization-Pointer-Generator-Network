A butler was crushed to death by a service lift as he prepared to serve tea at a stately home which featured on the TV series Middlemarch.

Arthur Mellar was rushed to hospital with serious head injuries after the freak accident at posh Burghley House near Stamford, Lincolnshire.

Doctors at Peterborough City Hospital battled to save the 48-year-old’s life but he was pronounced dead four hours later.

Mr Mellar, pictured, posted on his Facebook page that stately homes were 'an occupational hazard' 

The house was used as a backdrop in the 1994  BBC adaptation of George Eliot's classic book Middlemarch

Mr Mellar posted a selfie with the 16th century building on Facebook just three months before his death with the comment: 'Stately Homes are an occupational hazard, such a bore.'

Mr Mellar had worked as steward at the stately home for the past nine years. Unlike a typical butler whose main role is to serve food, the steward is more concerned with managing the estate and arranging security.  

Paying tribute to Mr Mellar his partner-of-three-years Gerwin Castillo, 39, said he was a 'loving, generous and kind' man.

Speaking from the home they shared in Stamford, the NHS health care worker added:

'They took him in an ambulance to Peterborough City Hospital.

'When I got there, he was surrounded by paramedics and doctors. He had a ventilator and they were trying to revive him.

'He was in the resuscitation room for four hours, fighting for his life.

'It feels like we were together for 30 years. He was such a beautiful person inside and out.

'He was kind and generous and a very loving man. He had a wicked sense of humour.

'The pain of losing him is immeasurable. He meant a lot to me. We’d made many plans together.

'Now I have to accept that he is no longer here. What I find heart-breaking is that he died in such an awful way.'

Gerwin Castillo described his partner as a 'kind, generous and very loving man with a wicked sense of humour'

Mr Castillo said: 'I was telephoned by his boss Orlando who said Arthur had been involved in an accident, and eight minutes later I was collected by a porter and taken to Burghley House.

'I was really worried. Orlando met us at the entrance and took me to where Arthur was.

'There were lots of people, paramedics all stood round him. He was unconscious. It was awful.

'At the time my mind was floating. They told me he got caught inside the elevator shaft of the old luggage lift which had somehow crushed him.

'I understand he was in the lift on his own. Somebody told me that the boss' children heard him crying for help.

'When I got there, I knew he was not going to survive. His face was bloated and purple and he had bruises all over his neck. I knew it was something very serious.

'He was taken to Peterborough Hospital by air ambulance but the doctor said he was very poorly and that he was unable to survive. They did their best.

'He no longer was responding to oxygen at that point so the doctor let him die peacefully.

'I stayed beside him until his very last breathe. I was hoping for a miracle.'

Mr Castillo had been in a relationship with Mr Mellar for three years after first meeting on an internet dating website.

He added: 'He was just a loving man. He would do everything for you, so kind and generous.

'We met three years ago on Match.com and it was our anniversary on July 8.

'It was like magic. There was so much chemistry. We were perfect.

'He was very proud of his work and didn't like programmes like Downton Abbey because he said there things in them that weren't really correct.

Mr Mellar, pictured, even served tea for the Queen Mother and owned a classic Bentley and Rolls Royce 

'We liked to watch YouTube, he was a big Shirley Bassey fan and loved Carry On films. He liked to mimic Shirley Bassey. He was a great entertainer.

'He had been a butler at Burghley for years and had been working as one at other estates around here before that. He had been a butler since he was 18.

'He once met the Queen Mother at an event at work and served her refreshments. he said she was charming. He also worked for Lord Chumley.' 

Classic car enthusiast, Mr Mellar, who owned a Bentley and a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, had worked at Grade I listed Burghley House for eight years.

He was originally from Barnsley, South Yorkshire where his mother Mona, brother Frederick and sister Ivy live. His father Fred died on New Year’s Eve.

The Health and Safety Executive confirmed they were investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr Mellar’s death alongside Cambridgeshire Police.

A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Police added: 'We were called to reports that a man in his 40s had suffered serious injuries at Burghley House on Saturday, July 12.

'He was taken to hospital but later died.

'A joint investigation is being carried out by police and the Health and Safety Executive.' 

Burghley House’s estate director David Pennell said the house would co-operate fully with the investigation.

He added: 'It is with the deepest sadness that we confirm the tragic death of Arthur

Mellar, a highly-valued member of the household team at Burghley, following an accident on Saturday, July 12.'

Burghley House was designed and built between 1555 and 1587 by William Cecil, Lord High Treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I.

The main part of the stately home has 35 major rooms on the ground and first floors but there are more than 80 lesser rooms.

There are also numerous halls, corridors, bathrooms and service areas with added visitor facilities including the Orangery restaurant, gift shop and gardens.
