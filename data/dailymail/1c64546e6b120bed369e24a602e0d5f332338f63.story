A pensioner has spent more than a decade painstakingly copying out every single word of the bible - in a 1,500-page labour of love.

Religious Dino Mazzoli, 78, came up with the idea of copying the religious text after mobility problems left him housebound back in 2001.

The amateur artist then wrote out the whole of the religious text on A4 paper - using hundreds of parker pens and sketching out more than 5,000 colourful illustrations.

Mr Mazzoli, who now wants to sell his unique book for charity, got a letter from the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, after finishing his work - believed to be a world first.

Dedicated: Dino Mazzoli shows off part of his hand written and illustrated Bibles. The folders behind him all contain different parts of the religious book

The Italian, who moved to England in 1961, said: 'I have dedicated my whole life to this for years and have done it every single day I could.

'I know it is perhaps considered old-fashioned but I am a Christian and this was something I wanted to do.

'It is unique - people have told me that they have not seen anything like it before.'

Mr Mazzoli, from Eastbourne, Sussex, first thought of the idea after struggling to get out the house after giving up work in a book shop.

The grandfather-of-three bought an American copy of the Old Testament and a British book of the new testament and began writing it out on A4 paper using a parker pen.

Keen artist Mr Mazzoli also began creating illustrations for the text using water colours, crayons and collages.

He would then cut them out and stick them into his bible.

This colourful illustration of Jesus and one of his followers is one of more than 5,000 that Mr Mazzoli has done while recreating the Bible

Unique: This page of the bible has a number of illustrations accompanying the words. The book is set to be published once copyright issues have been sorted out

Mr Mazzoli said: 'I would start every morning, do 8am until 10 or 11am, again in the afternoon and then for a long time in the evening.

'I started on Genesis and just kept going. I put four to five illustrations on each page of text then a larger drawing every five pages or so.

Proud: Mr Mazzoli shows off his work, which he has dedicated himself to for the last ten years

'I put quite a lot of energy into it.'

The influences from Dino’s drawings range from Picasso to Matisse, from Cezanne to del Castagno - with a little bit of each hidden in his pictures.

One larger image has a line from Revelation 2:7 alongside a picture of Holocaust victim Anne Frank. Another is inspired by William Blake.

Mr Mazzoli has now finished his masterpiece and even won praise from the Pope after his son sent details of the work to Rome.

His children, Laura, 38, and Marco, 36, now plan to publish the book both in print form, on the iPad and as an eBook.

He is just waiting on the final copyright permission to come through after using text from an American-based translation.

Mr Mazzoli said: 'I won’t make a penny from it. I want the proceeds to be divided up between charities, including Save the Children.

'My son sent it to Rome and I got a letter back thanking me for taking the time to do it. I also got a letter from and Archbishop and the Jerusalem Bible makers.

'They said they had never seen anything like it.

'I didn’t realise the Bible was subject to copyright but we are expecting the permission to come through soon so it could be printed later this year.

'I will keep painting. I do pictures for friends and love painting my family. I can’t go out any more because of my health, but I still have my painting and I am thankful for that.'
