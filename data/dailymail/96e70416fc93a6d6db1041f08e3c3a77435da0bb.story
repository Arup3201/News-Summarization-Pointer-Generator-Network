NFL fans flocked to Regent Street in their thousands on the eve of the Wembley game between the Oakland Raiders and Miami Dolphins.

A jersey from every franchise was on show along the half-mile stretch, as fans took part in a range of gridiron-themed events.

And with members of both teams, Hall of Famers and the Raiderettes on show, there was something for everyone.

Regent Street attracted NFL fans in their hundreds of thousands with a raft of activities and events for all ages

The Raiderettes' performance unsurprisingly brought Regent Street to a standstill 

The NFL stage took pride of place, with the likes of Rod Woodson, Bob Griese and Fred Biletnikoff on show, and also a very special guest in the shape of Dan Marino, who received the largest roar of the day.

As many fans sported his legendary No 13 jersey, Marino harked back to playing in London in 1988 for a pre-season game with the 49ers.

'I played here in 1988, and it has grown and grown here since then. It is an incredible sight to see. It goes to show the level of support there is here, not only for the Dolphins and the Raiders, but for the whole NFL. We thank you for that.'

Marino was snapped behind the scenes talking to current Miami quarterback, Ryan Tanehill, who has endured the toughest week of his three-year NFL career.

After being undermined by head coach Joe Philbin following his display during the woeful 34-15 loss to the Chiefs, Tannehill has been named starter for Wembley.

Thousands of NFL fans - ans quite a few bemused shoppers - turned out at the NFL event on Regent Street on Saturday afternoon

Meanwhile, there is no doubt who will start for the 'home team' at quarterback, with rookie Derek Carr asking the Raider Nation to be in typically good voice at Wembley.

'We are excited to go out and play in front of the fans here,' he said. 'This is our home game and we want it to be loud.'

600,000 fans flocked to the award-winning event last year and it looked as though that number may have been exceeded this time round.

The Dolphins vs Raiders clash is the first of three NFL International Series matches to be staged at Wembley this season.
