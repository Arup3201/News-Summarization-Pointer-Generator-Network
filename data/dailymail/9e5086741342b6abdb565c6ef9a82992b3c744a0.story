He's known as Baby Steve.

But this adorable five-year-old can definitely hold his own against the big boys when it comes to hitting waves.

This clip shows talented Steve Roberson effortlessly ride a huge wave - leaving other surfers trailing behind him in Honolua Bay in Maui, Hawaii. 

Expert: Surfing prodigy Steve Roberson, five, has no problem riding waves more than twice his small size

It begins  with a group of surfers attempting to catch the wave, but one by one, the grown-ups fall behind and the youngster is the only one left riding the swell to the end.

The surfing prodigy, dubbed 'Baby Steve' by the local surfing community, has been surfing for four years, but glides easily across the swell.

Steve, along with his older twin brothers Justin and Eric, make up the 'Roberson Brothers', who are coached by their pro surfer father Kaleo Roberson.

According to their Facebook page, the trio are 'your worst nightmare and your adorable angels all rolled up into one huge ball of laughs and chaos.'

The footage was taken in October and recently uploaded online.
