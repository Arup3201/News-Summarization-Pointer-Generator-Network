The waiting is almost over for Germany as the nation prepares to cheer their team on to glory in the World Cup final against Argentina at the Maracana.

As the country wakes up on World Cup final day with their team one victory away from winning their fourth World Cup, Germany's newspapers have backed Joachin Low's team ahead of the huge clash in Rio.

The Berliner Morgenpost names their starting XI for the final and gives them the tag 'Weltmeister', or 'World Champions'.

Bild has 
been counting down to the big day ever since Germany's stunning 7-1 
thrashing of Brazil in the semi-final, and their Saturday edition led 
with the words 'one more day - on Sunday the trophy belongs to us'.

Bayern Munich defender and German captain Philipp Lahm was quoted on the front page as saying: 'It is time to bring the title to Germany.'

The Morgenpost am Sonntag, meanwhile, led with a passionate statement saying 'Today we get the fourth star', referring to the number of stars above the badge on Germany's shirt in relation to how many times they have won the World Cup.

The newspaper also says that Germany will hold it's breath, and 'Argentina will cry'.

Saturday's Hamburger Morgenpost listed Germany's three previous triumphs - 1954 in Bern, 1974 in Munich and 1990 in Rome - and added Rio 2014 to the list with the background a full-page image of Germany's flag.

Another newspaper, TZ Wochenende, carries pictures of Germany's past glories. The message 'Guys, get back the cup' is written above a large number four and a picture of the World Cup trophy.

It's fair to say that Germany expects victory from their team and the eyes of the world will be watching the Maracana on Sunday.
