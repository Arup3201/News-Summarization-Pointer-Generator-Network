The Duchess of Cornwall met some of the first Saudi female members of parliament today and told them: 'Beneath all those pretty smiles there are a lot of very powerful women here.'

Two months ago 30 women were appointed by the country's ruler, King Abdullah, to the Majlis Ash Shura in what was considered a 'daringly' progressive move.

One, Hanan Al Ahmadi, told Camilla as they stood amidst the gold encrusted finery of the parliament building in Riyadh; 'We have been waiting for this for a very long time.

All smiles: Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, met Saudi Arabia's first female parliamentarians on the sixth day of a tour of the Middle East

Inspiring: Camilla said she as 'impressed' by the new female parliamentarians

Visit: Princes Charles is using the trip to discuss a number of issues including the military and commerce

'It is an emotional and very proud moment for us and carries a great deal of responsibility.'

She added; 'You coming here to meet us is an endorsement of what is happening here.

The Duchess replied: 'I am so impressed. You are all so clever and well-educated and are blazing such a trail.'

Prince Charles and his wife are currently on a nine-day tour of the Middle East on behalf of the government.

While the prince is using his trip to discuss issues as diverse as the military and commerce, Camilla is focusing on the role of women.

Saudi women have few legal rights and must seek permission from a male guardian for everything from opening a bank account to marriage.

They are still segregated from men in public: most offices, banks and universities have separate entrances and they are required to sit separately on public transport and in restaurants.

When it comes to dress, women are also expected to cover all parts of the body that are  ‘awrah’ – not meant to be exposed.

Saudi
Arabia’s strict interpretation of Islam means they must cover their 
entire body with a black cloak known as an abaya and headcovering, or 
hijab, leaving just the eyes and the hands exposed.

Conventions
for dress and behaviour are all fiercely enforced by the notorious 
mutawaeen, the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of 
Vice.

As a member of the 
British royal family, Camilla is not required to wear an abaya - but has
chosen to dress ‘demurely’ as a mark of respect to her hosts.

Trailblazing: Women still have few legal rights in Saudi Arabia and must seek permission from a male guardian for everything from opening a bank account to marriage

Forging ties: The Royal couple are on the third leg of a tour of the Middle East taking in Jordan, Qatar, Saudia Arabia and Oman

Respect: Camilla was not required to wear an abaya - but has chosen to dress ¿demurely¿

Last night the Duchess enjoyed a 
lavish women-only banquet thrown in her honour by HRH Princess Hessa 
Bint Trad Al Shaalan, the elderly King’s second - and favourite – wife 
(of four), who acts as his official consort.

As
she left wearing an elegant flowing gold embroidered trouser suit by 
designer Anna Valentine, the duchess smiled broadly and said: 'I am 
going off for dinner with 200 princesses. What fun!'

The
gathering was held at the quaintly named King’s Farm, a vast estate the
size of London an hour’s drive out of Riyadh where the monarch likes to
spend weekends.

Around 100 guests enjoyed cultural performances such as sword dancing before moving into dinner.

According to local custom, serving staff brought tray after tray of local delicacies until the principle guests signalled they could eat no more.

Banquet: Prince Charles attended an all-male banquet at a local wadi as a guest of the Crown Prince

Gifts: Earlier in the day the prince inspected a honour guard with the Commander of the National Guard Prince Miteb bin Abdullah where he was given a gold encrusted clock

Charles attended a similar all-male banquet at a local wadi as a guest of the Crown Prince.

Later the Duchess visited Princess Noura University, the first women’s university in Saudi Arabia and the largest women-only university in the world.

The new campus was inaugurated by King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz in 2011. There are currently over 1,000 staff members and more than 22,000 students.

Haran Al Hazza, 21, who is in her fourth year of a graphic design and digital media studies degree, said: 'I feel very proud to be part of this.'

The Duchess was told how students are dropped off and picked up by their chaperones each day but once inside the campus do  not have to wear their abaya and lead relatively normal lives.

She was also taken on a monorail ride around the campus, which is the size of a small city. She said: 'This place is astonishing, really impressive. There are some terribly clever young women and it is good to see them getting the chance to study in this way.'
