Homebuyers in their twenties are becoming an ‘endangered species’ because of soaring house prices, a report has warned.

Just 6 per cent of people who managed to buy a home last month were aged between 18 and 30, according to the National Association of Estate Agents.

Mark Hayward, managing director of the NAEA, said he clearly  remembered a meeting around 20 years ago when his colleagues expressed their concern that the age of a first-time buyer had risen from 24 to 27.

The shocking study shows that just six per cent of home buyers are under the age of 31

He described the latest  figures as ‘shocking’ and ‘disconcerting’, and said many young people had no chance of buying unless they were helped by their parents.

The report also revealed the battle homebuyers faced to secure their dream home, with too many people chasing too few homes for sale.

There is an average of 392 buyers registered with each estate agent, the highest number for eight years, but the typical estate agency has just 45 homes for sale.

The Bank of England said yesterday many people could be ‘speculating that they might benefit from higher prices if they delayed putting their properties on the market.’

The NAEA report, which was its first investigation into the age of homebuyers, said 94 per cent of homebuyers who managed to buy last month were aged 31 and over. ‘Homebuyers under the age of  31 have become an endangered  species,’ it said.

Of all the homebuyers in April, 50 per cent were aged 31 to 40, 35 per cent were 41 to 55 and 9 per cent were aged 56 and over.

Increasingly, young people are forced to continue living with their parents or move into rental accomodation

Official figures show a person in their twenties with a full-time job typically earns £21,196. But the average house price is £252,000 in the UK, or £459,000 in London where prices are rising by 17 per cent a year.

By the end of next year, the average house price will have risen to £285,000, or £560,000 in London, accountants Pricewaterhouse Coopers said this week.

Pensioners dominate the country’s homeowners, making up around one in three, according to the Government’s English Housing Survey.

Many first bought in their twenties and have gradually moved up the ladder, benefiting from rising house prices. Today, fewer than 10 per cent of homeowners in England are under the age of 35.

Mr Hayward said young people, who cannot afford to buy but would like to get on the property ladder, find it frustrating to watch prices go up without being able to benefit.

A record 3.3million Britons aged  20 to 34 are living with their parents, equal to one in four of this age  group, according to the Office for National Statistics.

However, a further 510,000 people aged 35 to 64 also continue to live with their parents, typically still in the childhood bedroom in which they grew up.
