They’ve been billed by their manufacturer as the 'best toy in the world' - but the kids would certainly have plenty of trouble keeping hold of them when mum and dad are around.

These individually hand-crafted miniature replicas of classic cars - which are half the scale of the original models - can be driven by adults and reach speeds of up to 46mph.

They come with a 110cc petrol engine or an electric motor. The motors are created by engineering firm Pocket Classics and their latest 'tribute' models include the AC Cobra and the Jaguar XK120.

Intricate versions of the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari 250 California Spider have also been built. A full size AC Cobra would cost up to £600,000 but this handmade miniature is priced at £7,995.

At 7ft 6ins long and 3ft wide, they are just big enough for an adult to drive. Each model takes the engineering firm approximately three months to build to order.

The replicas are fully serviceable and most come with working lights, horn, indicators, adjustable seats and disc brakes.

The petrol models deliver 250mpg and have a semi-automatic gear box with three gears, plus reverse.

Pocket Classics spokesman Ben Hedley said: ‘Our cars give people a way to live out their automotive dreams on a much smaller scale. They are engineered to work as the normal sized cars.

'The only thing we can't do at the moment is make them road legal - but we're working on changing that.'

Whatever you want: Cars can be built to a buyer's exact specification with any combination of interior and exterior colour

‘All the feedback we've had is that people wish they could have had one of these miniature cars when they were children. They are fun and fast, very unusual and a one off.’

He added: ‘We design the cars as tributes to the originals but they are not endorsed by the manufacturers - they are interpretations.'
