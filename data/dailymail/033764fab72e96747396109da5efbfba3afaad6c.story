For anyone with a fear of spiders, having one crawl into your bed and bite you is truly the stuff of nightmares.

But for Catherine Coombs, the nightmare is still continuing almost two months later, as a bite – believed to have been from the UK’s most venomous species of spider – nearly caused her to lose her left hand.

The 48-year-old woke up in excruciating pain one night in February, and her hand began to swell dramatically.

Recovering: Catherine Coombs woke up in excruciating pain when she rolled over and was bitten by the false widow on the back of the left hand

Deadly bite: Catherine Coombs from near Poole, Dorset, spent six weeks in hospital recovering from the venomous bite of the false widow

She was taken to hospital, where 
surgeons operated on her three times to remove the poison and decaying 
flesh and to try to prevent the venom from spreading up her arm.

At one point her condition was so bad doctors feared they would have to amputate her hand.

Her body temperature plummeted as the 
skin infection cellulitis set in and an inflamed patch on one of her 
legs even sparked concerns it had spread via her bloodstream.

Mrs Coombs has spent six weeks in 
hospital and is now at home waiting for the infection to  leave her body
 before she can have her tendons, which were left paralysed, rebuilt.

From the nature of the marks on her 
hand and her symptoms, doctors believe the culprit is likely to have 
been a noble false widow spider, named after its similarity in 
appearance to the black widow spider.

Mrs Coombs, a former medical photographer who lives near Poole, Dorset, said: ‘I have been terrified of spiders all my life.

‘People tell you it’s such a silly phobia and they can’t hurt you, but now I know that they can.’

She added: ‘For a while the doctors 
were worried that I may even lose the hand completely and I had to sign 
for amputation every time I went under anaesthetic.

‘Every time the surgeons operated they
 found more and more decay. They just kept taking away the dead flesh. 
Every time I woke up I made sure my hand was still there.’ 

She 
continued: ‘For the first week I felt very poorly and had a very high 
temperature and felt like I had a really bad case of the flu.

‘The pain in my hand was so awful and they operated three times in seven or eight days.

‘At the moment it feels like it’s never going to end.

‘I think I would have died if it had 
gone untreated. Cellulitis when it gets going can be nasty and there was
 no question of not treating it.’

She said of finding out a spider was 
to blame for her suffering: ‘I couldn’t believe it until I looked it up 
on the internet. I just thought, “This is England for goodness’ sake”.’

She now wants others to be on guard, saying: ‘Little boys out playing would pick a spider up.

‘Or they could fall on babies in prams. In the old days you used to put nets over prams, but you rarely see them now.’

Noble false widow spiders are about the size of a 50p piece but have the most venomous bite of any spider in the UK.

They tend to be found more commonly in
 southern England but it is thought they are now spreading further 
across the country due to climate change.

For the most part, they bite only when
 provoked, and Mrs Coombs believes she may have caused the one that 
attacked her to bite after rolling on to it as she slept.

In February, father-of-one Chris 
Galton, 31, collapsed after  being bitten ten times by a false widow 
spider on the back and neck in Southampton.
