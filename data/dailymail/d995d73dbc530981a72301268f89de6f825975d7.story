A Brooklyn man is headed to prison after it was revealed in a college application essay that he raped his eight-year-old stepdaughter more than a decade ago.

Albert Tarrats, 62, raped the child in 2003 while she slept in her bed, but the horrifying assault only came to light when the victim, now 19, wrote about the attack in 2012.

Her mother saw the essay and immediately called police. Following his Thursday conviction, Tarrats faces up to 25 years in prison.

Where he was convicted: Albert Tarrats was found guilty Thursday of multiple charges including rape and sexual assault at Brooklyn Criminal Court

‘Toward the end of their marriage he began to rape me,’ the teen wrote in the essay. ‘I never told anyone till later in life but at that point in my life I was scared.’

She then took the stand last week to testify about the suffering she has endured because of his callous acts.

‘She was very credible,’ one of the jurors told the New York Daily News. ‘The fact that so many years passed made us think she doesn’t have an ulterior motive.’

The victim’s mother divorced the convicted rapist in 2005 and moved to Florida, her daughter went with her.

Jurors shot down defense attempts to frame the claims as an attempt to defame Tarrats after her mother’s marriage failed, or to gain sympathy from college admissions counselors.

It’s her best effort to try to get the attention of the admissions committee of that college to convince them she was the best candidate for that school,’ Tarrats’ lawyer Earnest Hammer argued during his closing argument, according to the New York Post.

Hammer went out of his way to point out her poor grammar and make sure the whole courtroom knew she was not accepted to the school.

‘I’m sure it weighed heavily on her,’ another juror said, ‘and really affected her life.’

The jury found Tarrats guilty of multiple charges including rape and sexual assault.

He showed no emotion as the verdicts were read aloud in court.

His sentencing is June 30.
