Romelu Lukaku has confirmed his desire to leave Chelsea this summer as they close in on another expensive centre-forward in Diego Costa.

After spending two years on loan at West Bromwich Albion and then Everton, the Belgian striker admits his future lies elsewhere.

'You know Chelsea, every year they buy a new top striker,' said Lukaku.

'I remember me coming into the dressing room last year and seeing Samuel Eto’o and Demba Ba and going: 'Whoah! What’s happening here?

'But it’s no problem. Many clubs are interested in me. At this stage I have to look to myself. I have to play a good World Cup.

'That’s very interesting for all the players looking for a transfer. And I must be one of them. Chelsea know my point of view.'
