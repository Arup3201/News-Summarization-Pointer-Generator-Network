He and Cho have been together since after Cho's separation from her ex in 2012. Cho has one daughter, aged 7, from her previous marriage.

The couple announced their engagement at the CAA TV News Party at Manhattan's Hudson Hotel in front of friends and TV stars including Katie Couric, Erica Hill, Ronan Farrow, CNN boss Jeff Zucker, GMA host George Stephanoupoulos, NBC's Kate Snow, Mark Halperin, MSNBC President Phil Griffin and Harry Smith.

Elliott has also been married previously. He also has one child.

According to the Page Six source:'It’s been very low-key, and people may not have even realized she was engaged, because she’s not wearing a standard diamond engagement ring.'

The couple met while both were at ABC--Elliott with GMA Cho at New York affiliate WABC, where she remains.

Elliott announced his departure from ABC early this year after what were widely reported as 'heated' contract negotiations between the California native and the Disney-owned network.

He now covers a range of sports at NBC.

Cho has been an anchor at WABC news since 2003.
