Coca-Cola, which became one of the world's most iconic brands by marketing its soft drinks as a means to happiness, is now buying up popular television advertising slots to address obesity -- mainly in the U.S.

On Monday, the Atlanta, Georgia-based beverage giant began airing a two-minute commercial during the highest-rated shows on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News in hopes of becoming a clearly-heard voice in the growing debate over sodas and other sugary drinks and the health risks they cause.

Thinking thin: Coca-Cola, the world's leading beverage company, is taking to the airwaves for the first time to address a growing cloud over the industry: obesity

New message: Coca-Cola says its new health-conscious ad campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the year ahead, such as providing more diet options at soda fountains

The new television ad touts Coca-Cola's record of selling beverages with fewer calories over the years and notes that weight gain is the result of consuming too many calories of any kind and not just soda.

Coca-Cola says its latest marketing campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the upcoming year, such as providing more diet options at soda fountains.

For the world's number one beverage company in terms of market share, the new ads reflect  mounting pressures on the industry as a whole.

The soft drink industry is ‘an industry that’s under siege’ said Jeff Cronin, communications director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

‘This is a damage control exercise, not a meaningful contribution to addressing the issue of obesity,’ he told MailOnline, ‘The new commercial is not aimed at consumers, but rather policy makers.'

Later this year, New York City is set to put into effect a first-in-the-nation cap on the size of soft drinks sold at restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas and other venues, an initiative proposed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Henrietta Davis, the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, proposed a similar measure in June, saying she was inspired by New York's effort.

When PepsiCo Inc., the number two soda maker, recently signed a big endorsement deal with pop singer Beyonce, critics called for the singer to drop her contract or at least donate the money she made to groups that fund health initiatives.

‘What consumers need to know is that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other sugary drinks promote obesity, diabetes and other health problems,’ said Cronin of CSPI.

Diana Garza Ciarlante, a spokeswoman for the Coca-Cola Company, told the Associated Press that the new ads were not designed as a reaction to any negative public sentiment. She said that the company felt it needed to address ‘the issue of the times’ and be part of the discussion on obesity.

Looking good: The commercial shows young, thin and healthy-looking people as the narrator references Coca-Cola's efforts to help raise awareness about the health risks of drinking soft drinks with high sugar and calorie levels

Intentions: A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the new ads aren't a reaction to any negative public sentiment but that the company felt it needed to address 'the issue of the times' and be part of the discussion on obesity

‘We have not done a good enough job in telling our story and being consistent in telling our story,’ she said, noting the company had to be careful in its messaging to remain consistent with its brand voice and avoid sounding ‘preachy.’

In the ad, a narrator notes that obesity is an issue that ‘concerns all of us’ while people can make a difference when they ‘come together.’

The spot was produced by agencies Bright House Media Strategies and Citizen2 and is intended to reflect Coca-Cola's corporate responsibility among cable news viewers.

Coke Zero = 0.5 calories, no sugar

Diet Coke = 0.5 calories, no sugar

Caffeine-Free Diet Coke = 0.5 calories, no sugar

Diet Coke with Cherry = 1.5 calories, no sugar

Diet Coke with Citrus Zest = 2 calories, no sugar

Sprite Zero = 2.0 calories, zero sugar

Fanta Zero Icy Lemon = 3 calories, 0.3 sugar

Fanta Zero Orange = 5 calories, 0.8 sugar

Another advertisement, which will run later this week during ‘American Idol’ and before the Super Bowl, is much more reminiscent of the upbeat advertising people have come to expect from Coca-Cola, such as the company's digitally-rendered polar bears.

The second ad features a montage of activities that amount to burning off the ‘140 happy calories’ in a can of Coke: dancing, walking a dog, laughing with friends and doing a victory dance after bowling a strike.

Ciarlante of Coca-Cola said the 30-second spot, a version of which ran in Brazil last month, is intended to address confusion about the number of calories in soda.

She said the company's consumer research showed that people thought there were as many as 900 calories in a can of soda.

She declined to offer details on the health-related actions Coca-Cola has planned for the upcoming year. One of the options under consideration is putting the amount of activity needed to burn off the calories in a drink on cans and bottles, she said.

Coca-Cola points out in its latest commercial that the company has already begun making efforts to help customers make smarter health choices, such as putting calorie counts on the front of its cans and bottles in the U.S.

Last year, the company also started posting calorie information on its vending machines ahead of a regulation that will require soda companies to do so by 2014.

Public concern over calorie counts is apparent in Coca-Cola's sales numbers. In North America, all the growth in the company's soda business over the past 15 years has come from low- and no-calorie drinks, such as Coke Zero.

Diet sodas now account for nearly a third of its sales in the U.S. and Canada. Other beverages, such as sports drinks and bottled water, are also fueling growth in the market.

Even with the growing popularity of diet sodas, however, overall soda consumption in the U.S. has declined steadily since 1998, according to industry tracker Beverage Digest.

'Come together': In the ad, the narrator notes that obesity is an issue that 'concerns all of us¿ but that people can make a difference when they ¿come together'
