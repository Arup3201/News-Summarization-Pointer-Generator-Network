Crash victim: Paula Jurek, 20, a student from Poland, died after being hit by a lorry at a junction

A lorry with a faulty indicator crushed a cyclist to death without the driver even realising what he had done, an inquest heard yesterday.

A loose bulb in the indicator meant that Paula Jurek had no idea the vehicle was turning into her path.

The 20-year-old tourism undergraduate suffered multiple injuries and died almost instantly as she went under its front wheel.

Witnesses told St Pancras Coroner’s Court they did not see driver Barry Roe indicate before making the left turn.

His lorry was later found to have had a bulb fitted incorrectly to its left side indicator.

Road traffic collision investigator Paul Deneyes told the inquest: 'It wasn't that it was broken as such, it was that the bulb wasn't fitted correctly.

'It's possible that a cyclist travelling on the near side of the lorry may not have known it was making a left turn because they could not see the indicator.'

Eyewitnesses said they didn't see the driver indicate before it hit Miss Jurek, a management and tourism student at London Metropolitan University.

AA patrolman Romain Lamamy said: 'The front wheel of the lorry went over her.

'I told him he had driven over a cyclist. I told him several times and pointed her out under the wheel. I was shocked that he had not noticed.'

The accident happened at the junction between Camden Road and St Pancras Way in Camden, north London, on April 5, 2011.

Mr Roe, who was acquitted of causing death by careless driving at a subsequent trial, told the inquest that he did not see Miss Jurek, who had come to Britain from Poland two years earlier.

He said: 'As I moved off I checked all my mirrors. I was stationary at the lights, then they changed to green and it's then that I indicated.

'I did not know about the defect with the indicator light. I checked it that morning. I checked the lights and the tyres. It's normal procedure.'

Recording a verdict of death by road traffic collision, Deputy Coroner Selena Lynch said: 'I have come to no conclusion about whether or not the indicators were activated by the driver of the lorry.

'The deceased was riding her pedal cycle and as she approached the lights she came to a standstill to the left of the lorry. She was not visible to the driver, even through his rear and side view mirrors.

'The rear side indicator was defective and the deceased was not aware the lorry was turning left.

'My verdict is one of road traffic collision. I am afraid this isn't the first such case of this type. I have done many over the years.

'There's a great conflict on London roads between users. Great dangers arise when cyclists and lorries come into contact with one and other. It's always the cyclist that comes off worse.

'Perhaps the only comfort we can take is that this death did not involve a lot of suffering as Miss Jurek was unconscious almost instantaneously.'

After the inquest Paula's angry mother, Iwona, who travelled over from Poland for the hearing, said: 'We didn't know this was an inquest, we thought it was the court case. We have only found out the driver had been acquitted.

'We're shocked and angry. There has been no communication. We have been waiting for two years for justice. After hearing the evidence we still have doubts and want to take the matter further. Justice would make the matter easier to take.'

Paying tribute to her 'special' daughter, she added: 'She had big dreams. She was very intelligent.

'She had lived in London for two years and loved it here. She loved people and wanted to travel the world. She was special.'

A spokesman for the London Cycling campaign said: ‘Crashes with large lorries account for about half the cyclist deaths in London.

'We at the LCC have been campaigning to improve the equipment on lorries and for all drivers to have extra training including sessions riding a bike.

'It is difficult to understand how the driver in this case was acquitted for failing to see Paula. If he was turning into a "blind spot" he should have done it with extreme care.

‘We have called for that junction to be made safer with a safe area for cyclists but to date nothing has been done.’
