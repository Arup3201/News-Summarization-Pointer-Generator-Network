Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer loves spending time in Bali. Whether it’s diving in Lombok or skiing with friends, the 32-year-old likes nothing better than going on holiday.

The Reading lass loves adventure and counts her travels down the western coast of Goa as one of her most memorable life experiences.

Natalie, who plays Queen Margaery Tyrell in the popular American fantasy drama, has a soft spot for London and enjoys spending time on the South Bank.

Here the talented actress, who travelled to Rome to narrate a story for travel brand Contiki, tells MailOnline Travel about India's rail system, her favourite places in London and two things she cannot travel without.

What sort of traveller are you? What are your favourite types of holidays? 

I love all sorts. I love walking holidays and skiing with friends, but in recent years I've been so busy with work that I’m only able to go on holiday once a year. Lately it’s tended to be somewhere hot to unwind on a beach and scuba dive. Because of my job I get a lot of opportunity to grab a few days here and there in many cool cities for press commitments, magazine shoots and premieres —Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Paris, Stockholm, New York, Berlin. I always try to get to a gallery or museum if there's time.

Have you ever been to New Zealand or Canada and if you haven't, are they on your bucket list?

I have been to Canada several times. It was autumn when I visited Vancouver and I will always remember the colour of the trees in British Columbia were stunning. I have shot in Toronto and find it a very trendy, friendly city. I look forward to having opportunity to go back for the film festivaI. 

I would love to go to New Zealand and try some of the adventurous stuff to be found in Queenstown. Both my cousin and my brother loved the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. As a family we were all brought up hiking so I'd like to do that.

I definitely need to return to Asia. I got to Bali and Lombok last year. The Gili Islands gave me some of my best scuba diving experiences including tons of turtles.

What’s been your most memorable life experience?

Travelling down the western coast of India. We travelled down from Mumbai and into Goa and then much further down into Kerala. I loved Kerala – fresh coconut juice every day! The train system in India is chaotic and fun – it's the best way to see the landscape. Being in with all the families and also being the odd animal is a colourful experience you’ll never forget. I would love to go to the Himalayas and cross over into Nepal to do the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway.

What are your favourite places in London? 

I love the South Bank – there is always something going on down by the river there. It's home to some of our greatest cultural institutions like the National Theatre, the Hayward Gallery, the British Film Institute, the Royal Festival Hall. There’s also the famous outdoor book stall and the skate park with its funky graffiti and groups of young skaters. You can check out the food market down there, hit up great bars and restaurants and visit the Christmas market in December. Plus, you get incredible views of The Thames, St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and central London. You can just stroll along and take in the view.

What is one thing you cannot leave home without and why when you travel?

There are two things. First of all, my yoga mat comes everywhere. Keeps me stretched out after sitting still on all those planes, trains and road journeys.

You need a great hat too. If it's hot it'll keep the sun off your face, if it's cold it will keep the heat in, if you need to sleep you pull it down over your eyes and if your hair is starting to get a bit greasy from all the travelling, it hides it when you're in desperate need of a shower!

What’s the most amazing shoot location you’ve been on for Game of Thrones?

The most amazing set where I’ve shot Game of Thrones is definitely Croatia, in Dubrovnik. It’s such a stunning country with lots of good watersports there as well. Just a beautiful, beautiful place.

What attracted you to this particular project and why did you want to work with a youth travel brand?

Travel is so important in its capacity to expand the mind. It’s exciting to start as young as possible – you get to see how other cultures live, challenge your senses and try different cuisines. Travel also shows you the diverse wildlife we share this planet with and gives you perspective on just how huge the Earth is. My first time to Rome was when I was backpacking with my best friend around Europe for a month at 18 years old, so I remember that excitement of being away from home properly for the first time.
