Convicted NYPD cop killer Ronell Wilson had a sex act done to him by his girlfriend with his mother and sister in the room, a source has revealed

The convicted cop killer who impregnated a female prison guard while incarcerated has more dirty secrets, it was revealed today.

Ronell Wilson, who was convicted in 2006 of killing an undercover NYPD detective, was pleasured from another girlfriend ahead of his incarceration while his mother and sister were in the visiting room, sources revealed. 

The source said that mother Depetra Wilson and Vanessa Warrick turned away while Wilson was receiving the sex act, and that the salacious event was captured on prison surveillance camera.

The source told the New York Daily News that prosecutors considered using the footage against Wilson in his case to try and get the death penalty.

The feds were hoping to illustrate the 30-year-old man’s blatant disregard for authority and the fact that he posed a danger to himself and others while behind bars. 

Wilson will be sentenced sometime this spring in Brooklyn Federal Court. Court papers show that former prison guard, Nancy Gonzalez, is eight-and-a-half months pregnant with their son, and faces 15 years in prison if convicted for having sex with Wilson.

The convicted killer impregnated a prison guard in an
alleged plot to avoid the death penalty had been so desperate to father a child
that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his
former lawyer.

Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client
Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept
responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews
and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison. 

'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal — as
long as he could have conjugal visits — because he was determined to leave this
earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning, Savitt
told the New York Post.

For Wilson to be 
allowed to meet with women behind
bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former 
attorney
said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far 
because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed 
agreement.

Wilson's former prison guard-turned-paramour Nancy Gonzalez, 29,
was arrested last month for having an illicit affair with him and getting pregnant
with his child in an alleged scheme to help him escape the death penalty.

Sources told The New York Post that during his try with
Gonzalez last year, Wilson was also placing 'romantic' phone calls with three
other women from behind bars.

In the aftermath of Gonzalez’s arrest on suspicion that she
had hatched a plot with Wilson to help save his life, the father of one of the
slain officers, Rodney Andrews, spoke out against the idea that his son's
killer should be shown leniency just because he got the woman pregnant.

'Put him to death for what he did,' Rodney Andrews Sr told New
York Daily News. 'If he had 20 children, it wouldn't change my mind.'

The 72-year-old father went on to say that Ms Gonzalez does
not deserve any mercy either.

Change of heart: On her MySpace page, Gonzalez summed up her attitude toward children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me'

On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted a photo depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed across the front.

Interestingly enough, on her MySpace page, the 29-year-old described her attitude towards children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me.'

Gonzalez was arrested Tuesday on 
charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the 
night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the 
law.

She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, 
according to court papers.

Wilson
was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank 
shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry.

‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers.

Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court.

A new jury must decide his fate. But 
replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers
seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty 
because he is mentally disabled.

According
to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted 
killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants.

According
to one inmate, he witnessed the 29-year-old female guard moving away 
from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down.

The complaint made public Tuesday and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen.

One of many: While carrying on an affair with Gonzalez, pictured, Wilson was allegedly wooing three other women from behind bars

The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison.

Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope.

'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?'

It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection.

'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.'

Wilson was found guilty in December 
2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, 
in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island.

The
following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal
defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954.

However,
an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a 
prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to 
be a villain. 

Raymond Patterson, a noted psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the prosecution, told the New York Post that while Wilson suffers from anti-social personality disorder, he is not mentally handicapped.
