A guard who lost his job after taking a photo during a visit from President Obama has spoken out about being fired - saying it was 'unjust'.

Kenneth Tate, 47, a security guard who worked at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, embarrassed the Secret Service and was thrown into a political firestorm last month - but has said all he wanted out of the encounter was a picture to show his 81-year-old mom.

He was fired from his $42,000 job after getting too close to the President's security detail during a visit on September 16, and taking a picture of the assembled cars.

'Injustice': Kenneth Tate, 47, said he unfairly lost his job after he took a photograph during a visit by President Obama - and also embarrassed the Secret Service by riding next to him in an elevator while armed

Speaking to the New York Times in the wake of the sacking, Tate called the events which lost him his position 'a nightmare' and 'unjust'.

He also spoke out about the scandal that erupted when it emerged he was armed during the encounter with Obama - contrary to rules which state that only Secret Service agents can have firearms in the President's presence.

The revelation came as an embarrassment to the service, which was still reeling from accusations of incompetence after letting a man armed with a knife hop the White House fence and charge inside. 

Secret Service Director Julia Pearson resigned soon after.

Tate says he was never told to surrender his gun, and was in the elevator because it was his job. 

He told the Times: 'From the reports, I was some stranger that entered the elevator. I mean, I was appointed.'

'Tarnished': Tate is now unemployed after losing his CDC job, and says his good name has been smeared

Before it emerged the day had cost him his livelihood, Tate said he was proud to have met the President - who shook his hand and asked his name.

A Secret Service agent apparently quipped that this was remarkable, as he had never been acknowledged by Obama in two years. 

But speaking later, he said the day tarnished his reputation. He said: 'It's a nightmare. My whole life's been changed upside-down.'

'How do you go anywhere when it seems like the doors have been closed on you, your reputation tarnished, the embarrassment?

Recalling the encounter, he said: 'He [Obama] acknowledged me, he asked me what my name was and extended his hand and shook my hand.

'I was trying to get a picture of them leaving, and I was unsuccessful.

'At the end part I tried to take a picture of them leaving. The motorcade was driving, they were parked, getting ready to leave.

'I tried to get a picture for my mom, she's 81 years old, just to show that I had met the President.

'When I got back the agents stated that somebody was going to lose their job, because nobody ever got that close to the motorcade.

'I didn't know it was going to be me.

'Two days later I was told to bring my statement in - when I was bringing my statement in the captain told me I didn't need it because the CDC had already taken me off the contract.'

Tate, who is now unemployed, has never been given an official explanation for his sacking. He was not directly employed by the CDC, but worked for a company called Professional Security Corporation.

His son, who also worked at the CDC headquarters, also lost his job two weeks later - which the organization blamed on 'downsizing'.

A Secret Service source indicated that Tate's account is a fair summary of what happened that day - though an executive at his old company told the Times his description was 'not correct' - but would not elaborate.
