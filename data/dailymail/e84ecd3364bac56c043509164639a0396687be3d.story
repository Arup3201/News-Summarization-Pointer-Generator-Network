Argentina cruised to a 2-0 friendly victory over El Salvador at the Fedex Field in Landover Maryland. 

Gerardo Martino's side dominated the game and took the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Nestor Renderos own goal deflected from Ever Banega's shot.    

Substitute Federico Mancuello then made sure of the win with a free kick from a tight angle on 88 minutes.

El Salvador (5-4-1): Carillo; Flores, Mendoza, Molina, Renderos (Ceren 88), Larin; Alvarez, Ceren, Menjivar (Punyed 76), Alas (Santamaría 67); Bonilla (Burgos 59)    

Argentina (4-2-3-1): Guzman; Zabaleta, Musacchio, Funes Mori, Orban; Pereyra, Banega; Di Maria (Mancuello 73), Lavezzi, Tevez (Pastore 78); Higuain 

Scorers: Renderos O.G. 54, Mancuello 88  

Martino started Carlos Tevez for the first time since taking over the team last year, but the Juventus forward was ineffective in attack alongside Gonzalo Higuain and Angel Di Maria.

Meanwhile, PSG winger Ezequiel Lavezzi made his return to the national side for the first time since the World Cup final loss against Germany last year. 

Argentina face Ecuador on Tuesday in the Meadowlands, in their last warm-up match before the Copa America in June.
