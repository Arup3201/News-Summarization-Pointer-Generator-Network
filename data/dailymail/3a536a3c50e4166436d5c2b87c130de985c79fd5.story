New details are emerging about the death of the Hawaii Health Director who authorized the release of President Obama's birth certificate in 2011 who was killed in a plane crash on Wednesday.

Loretta Fuddy, 65, was the only person on the aircraft to die  when the plane went down in the Pacific near a remote island. The others, including the pilot, were either rescued by boat or swam ashore.

In the final moments of her life, Fuddy 
clung to the hand of her deputy after the plane taking them back to 
Honolulu crashed in the ocean off the island of Molokai.

Only victim: Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy was the only death among nine aboard the Cessna Grand Caravan that crashed in the ocean near Molokai, Hawaii on Wednesday

Fuddy was on her way back to Honolulu 
after a visit to what was once Hawaii's leper colony on the island of 
Molokai when, officials said Thursday, the Cessna Grand Caravan went 
down due to engine failure.

Fuddy, who gained notoriety in 2011 for her role in making President Barack Obama's birth certificate public, was one of nine people onboard the flight that went down.

In the water, Fuddy held hands with deputy director Keith Yamamoto as he tried to help her relax, said the Rev. Patrick Killilea, who consoled Yamamoto after the ordeal.

'He recounted how he said he helped Loretta into her life jacket and he held her hand for some time,' the priest said. 'They were all floating together and she let go and there was no response from her.'

Help: A U.S. Coast Guard rescue team poses in front of a helicopter used in the rescue at Kapolei, Hawaii, on Thursday. The small plane crashed Wednesday, killing Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy.

Coast Guard rescuers who arrived after making the half-hour flight from Oahu to the neighbor island said Thursday that the single-engine turboprop aircraft wasn't visible when they got there, only the nine passengers floating across about a half-mile of water littered with random debris.

The rescuers in two helicopters and an HC-130 airplane said the people were in clusters and acted calm when help arrived.

'I'm sure they were exhausted,' Aviation Survival Technician P.J. Ornot said. The passengers were wearing inflatable yellow life jackets, floating on their backs in the water, he said.

Rescue swimmer Mark Peer said when he swam to Fuddy, she was unresponsive and he couldn't find a pulse. 'It was not a good feeling,' he said.

The incident occurred when the single engine of the 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan failed soon after it took off from Molokai and made its turn toward Honolulu, said Richard Schuman, owner of Makani Kai Air, operator of the plane.

The crash was calm, orderly and none of the passengers seemed to be very distressed or have any major injuries, said the passenger who swam to shore.

C. Phillip Hollstein recalled Friday that the plane had just taken off from Molokai and was making a turn toward Honolulu when it seemed like something on the plane broke.

'We probably weren't a minute out,' he said. 'It wasn't real loud or anything. Just a muffled bang. Then we were a glider.'

The plane lost power, he said, and the pilot maneuvered a water landing on the plane's belly.

'Everyone was real quiet. We hit (the water) and it was all about getting the belts off,' he said, describing how everyone started putting on life jackets and remained on the plane until it seemed to start sinking.

'There wasn't panic or anything. It was very orderly,' he said. 'It wasn't like any of the movies or the TV shows.'

Bobbing in the water, Hollstein noticed the pilot and seven other passengers seemed fine. 'I didn't want to sit out there bobbing, so I figured I'd take a shot at going to the shoreline.'

He guesses the swim to the rugged shoreline took an hour and a half. He was surprised to hear later that one of the passengers, Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy, had later died.

'She was doing fine out of the airplane,' Hollstein said. 'Her assistant was really watching her. He was taking care of her.'

Gov. Neil Abercrombie 
said Fuddy was loved and respected. 'Her knowledge was vast, her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience,' he said.

About 100 Health Department 
employees lined up to pay their respects to Fuddy's family members, who 
attended a gathering in her memory at the department's parking lot 
Thursday.

After the crash, three survivors 
were transported by helicopter to a Honolulu hospital. Two declined to 
be medically evacuated, officials said.

Hollstein
 said he and a local couple were taken to the Molokai hospital, where 
they took hot showers and dried their clothing. They were given a place 
to rest until they could get rooms at the island's only hotel.

Fuddy
 and Yamamoto were on the flight after an annual visit to Kalaupapa, 
where the state exiled leprosy patients until 1969. The area is 
accessible only by plane or mule.

The leprosy 
settlement on Kalaupapa is still run by the Health Department, though 
only a few former leprosy patients continue to live there.

Proof? Fuddy entered the national spotlight briefly in 2011 when she authorized the release of Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate to put to rest so-called 'birther' conspiracies about the nation of the Commander-in-Chief's birth
