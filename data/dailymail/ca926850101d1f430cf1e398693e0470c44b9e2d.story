Britain's most senior police officer yesterday warned that Right-wing extremists could 'hijack' vigilante patrols protecting against looters.

Acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner Tim Godwin singled out the English Defence League and the British National Party as two organisations who might exploit the situation.

His warning comes amid intelligence that the EDL has successfully infiltrated vigilante groups in Enfield, North London – scene of some of the worst mindless violence and criminality on Sunday night – and Eltham in South East London.

Protest: Vigilantes run through the streets of Enfield on Tuesday night. Police accused them of diverting resources away from other communities

Police warn the potential for this to 'fuel the flames' of an already fraught situation by adding a 'violent racial element' is 'enormous and worrying.'

Residents claimed some English Defence League supporters were involved in organising vigilante patrols of young white men under the name Enfield Defence League on Tuesday night.

They split into three 30-strong groups in contact by mobile telephone and BlackBerry to patrol the streets.

Underlining police concerns, the EDL said yesterday: 'Supporters have taken to the streets to help defend their communities and prepare for the clean-up operations that must follow the last few days of rioting and looting.

'We already have members organising themselves in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Norwich and Birmingham, and are also looking to organise efforts in Bristol, Leeds, Wolverhampton, Salford, Nottingham, Leicester and Hull.'

Hundreds of police officers descended on a London suburb last night to disperse about 60 men who claimed to be protecting shops and businesses there for a second night.

The men, apparently supporters of the extreme-right English Defence League, gathered in a pedestrianised square in Eltham drinking cans of beer and chanting 'We love you England'.

With shops and pubs in the high street shut, the group – white men aged in their 20s to 50s – brought carrier bags with beer in them and drank and sat on benches.

But around 300 police officers flooded the high street, surrounding the group. Around 8.30pm, the order was given to disperse the group of EDL supporters – and youths who had arrived to see what was going on.

Officers moved in to shepherd the group away from the square, known as Passey Place, and out of the town down Eltham Hill. It was reported that some bottles were thrown at the police.

The presence of the EDL in Eltham has been condemned by local politicians. Eltham MP Clive Efford, a shadow home office spokesman said: 'The English Defence League just want to put a sinister racial twist on this.

'All these police resources for what? To deal with the English Defence League? That's appalling. These police officers could be used elsewhere, protecting communities across London, but they have got to be in here to deal with these drunken yobs who have decided to come to Eltham and cause racial tension.'

On Tuesday night around 50 members of the group joined with 150 to 200 locals to protect Eltham from looters they claimed were expected to try to attack the area.

They tried to march towards Lewisham – hit by rioting on Monday night – but were pushed back towards Eltham by police and dispersed around 11.30pm. There were no arrests and no reports of damage.

Speaking as he toured Enfield 
yesterday, Mr Godwin said: 'I am worried that there are groups out there
 like the EDL and BNP who are trying to hijack this and cause more 
tensions in the community. They are politically motivated groups who 
have another agenda.'

He 
added: 'I have not got a problem with community groups protecting their 
property or places of worship, which wasn't needed in the end.'

But
 he warned: 'The police will arrest anyone committing a criminal act, 
whether they are looting or vigilantes breaking the law.'

The Met's Deputy Assistant  Commissioner Steve Kavanagh echoed those warnings yesterday, saying: 'What I don't need is these so-called vigilantes, who appeared to have been drinking too much, taking policing resources away from what they should have been doing – which is preventing the looting.'

He spoke out after hundreds of residents in several London areas joined together to drive off would-be looters.

Some groups had armed themselves with lengths of pipe and baseball bats, while some shopkeepers had knives in their stores, claiming that police were 'nowhere to be seen' and had 'failed' them during the first three days of violence.

Sikh men armed with hockey sticks and metal bars were on guard yesterday in both West London and West Bromwich and stressed they were there with the 'full knowledge' of police.

Yesterday, the EDL said: 'We are hoping to safeguard local businesses through a strong physical presence, and discourage trouble-makers from gathering in our town and city centres.

'The EDL, and all decent people, be they black, white, Christian, Sikh, Jewish or Muslim, are sickened by this mindless, selfish and ultimately self-defeating behaviour.'

But Searchlight, the anti-fascist organisation, expressed deep concern last night at the EDL involvement, saying: 'The news that the EDL is promising to come out on the streets to defend our communities from rioters should be met with the derision and contempt it deserves.

'The EDL is the last thing our communities need.'
