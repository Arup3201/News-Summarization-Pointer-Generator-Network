Fitness coach Raymond Verheijen has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal's training methods after Aaron Ramsey was the latest player to be plagued by the club's injury curse.

The 23-year-old was taken off at half-time in the Champions League against Galatasaray on Tuesday - his third game in a week - after tweaking a hamstring, which rule him out for at least three to four weeks.

The Wales international's absence comes as a further blow to manager Arsene Wenger, who will also be without Jack Wilshere in central midfield for several months.

Fitness coach Raymond Verheijen tweeted several times on Friday to condemn Arsenal's training methods

And Verheijen, who in the past has condemned the Gunners for 'incompetent periodisation and injury prevention', is adamant their crippling injury list is due to their own training pitfalls.

'Sad to read the news about yet another muscle injury for Aaron Ramsey. His injury record at Arsenal is simply shocking for such young player,' he tweeted on Friday.

The Dutchman was quick to stick the boot in on the club's treatment of fellow compatriot Robin van Persie during his time at the Emirates, before his move to Manchester United too.

Van Persie swapped north London for Manchester two seasons ago and Verheijen believes that the 31-year-old has been 'damaged' by Arsenal in what was an injury-plagued eight years at the club.

'RVP is only 31 yrs but more & more starts to look like an old man on pitch because of all damage done to his body during his Arsenal period,' he later tweeted.

'The same career threatening process takes place at Arsenal with Ramsey, [Theo] Walcott, Wilkshire [sic] & [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain who are structurally injured.

'Players who are injured season after season develop all kind of weak links inside the body so a vicious injury cycle develops during career.

'Thankfully, [Cesc] Fabregas was able to escape Arsenal after a few years so the amateurs in London did not get the chance to also destroy his body.'

Arsenal host Newcastle in the Premier League evening kick-off on Saturday.
