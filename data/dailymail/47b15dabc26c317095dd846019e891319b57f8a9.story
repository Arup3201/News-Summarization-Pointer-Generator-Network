New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dressed down a constituent yesterday after she insisted that musician Bruce Springsteen had asked the Republican politician to stop playing his music at events.

The heckler, identified by NJ.com as Jersey resident Sandy Booket, confronted Christie at a town hall meeting and told him she was 'pretty sure' Springsteen had banned him from playing his songs because 'he didn't believe' in the governor's politics.

'No. You're wrong about that. Bruce has never asked me to do that. He never has,' Christie matter-of-factually told her.

'You're wrong about that': Chris Christie cut down a constituent on Tuesday after she told him she was 'pretty sure' Bruce Springsteen had asked the Republican governor to stop playing his music at political events

'You were 
dancing with Bon Jovi maybe in the Hamptons,' the woman, who held up an 'INDICT' sign with handcuffs on it throughout the event, retorted as Christie mentioned that he saw Springsteen just last week.

'Well,
 no, that I was doing this weekend, and I wasn't dancing with Bon Jovi 
actually I was dancing with Jamie Foxx,' he told her to laughter from 
other town hall attendees. 'So if you're gonna be cute, we should get 
the story right.'

Christie continued to cut the woman down, explaining again that he recently saw Springsteen, and the subject never came up.

'I saw Bruce about a week and a half ago, and he had every opportunity 
to tell me not to. He didn't, and he never has told me not to do it.'

After
 the woman tried to interrupt Christie several more times, the mouthy 
politician told her she has a right to disagree with his policies 'and 
that's fine.'

'But
 don't put it in Bruce's mouth, because I know Bruce and I've spoken to 
Bruce and you're wrong. You're absolutely wrong,' he said.

The heckler, Sandy Bookett, held a sign up throughout Christie's town hall that said: INDICT

After Christie told her he saw Springsteen just last week she the Republican governor: 'You were dancing with Bon Jovi maybe in the Hamptons'

'And
 maybe guys, just When I leave, just so we can have this lady be a 
little calmer, let's play Bon Jovi on the way out,' he snarked to his 
staff.

Attempting to make her a joke of her own, the woman told them they should play Bon Jovi's hit song Wanted Dead or Alive.

'Well
 you see that's the kind of positive, upbeat stuff that folks like you 
bring to these meetings and this debate all the time,' Christie replied.

'And you know what? I'm more than happy to have folks like you absolutely alive,' he added.

The
 woman tried to engage with the Republican governor and presumed 2016 
presidential candidate again, but he tersely told her: 'I think I've 
heard pretty much what you have to say. I think we got the idea.'

The two sparred for a few more seconds before Christie shut her down once and for all.

'If you wanna debate run for governor and then I'll debate you. But I'm not debating you now.

'Next question,' he said, putting a pin in the argument.

CBS
 New York claims that the woman tried to reengage with the governor on 
another issue, but staff cut her microphone, and the event moved on.
