Battle: Bronwen Davies had to go to court to win a £164 refund for four months' fees from a gym owned by millionaire businessman Duncan Bannatyne

Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has become embroiled in an undignified row with a recovering cancer patient whom he has banned from his health clubs.

The entrepreneur, who is reported  to be worth £430million, acted after  Bronwen Davies, 60, won a £164 refund in a court battle over charges for her Bannatyne’s gym membership while she was undergoing treatment.

In a letter, the owner of the health club empire said he was ‘not prepared to ever re-accept’ Mrs Davies as a member.

He also used his Twitter account to accuse her of being ‘disruptive’.

Mrs Davies was diagnosed with cancer of the tonsils and attempted to suspend her  £41-a-month membership of the gym while she was unable to use its facilities because she was undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

She said she put the request in writing, and asked her husband to prolong the temporary cancellation while she was ill.

After reimbursing her for one of the months for which payment was taken, however, the gym continued to charge for another four months’ membership.

She later wrote to the company several times – including to Bannatyne himself – but then took the issue to the Office of Fair Trading and eventually the county court, which ruled in her favour.

Keen to re-join the gym in Cardiff, where she had been a member for five years, Mrs Davies then received a letter from Bannatyne, stating that this would not be allowed.

It read: ‘Whilst I do not agree with the Court’s decision or its interpretation of our membership agreement and policies, I’m willing to accept its decision.

‘However, I am not prepared to ever re-accept you as a member at any of Bannatyne Group’s health clubs because I strongly disagree with your conduct.’  

The tycoon, 62, then took to  Twitter to attack Mrs Davies,  telling his 444,000 followers: ‘Only  a complete moron would believe that story.’

He then wrote: ‘What can I do? Sue a cancer survivor for lying?’

He added: ‘She is very good at getting sympathy but disruptive to my club so therefore banned.’  

Yesterday Mrs Davies, a mother of two, who is now in remission, said going to court had a damaging effect on her fragile health after the cancer treatment in 2009.

She said: ‘This court case just added to my stress. I was really very unwell. I looked like something out of the Holocaust and certainly couldn’t go to a gym.

‘I was severely malnourished and there were times when I didn’t think I was going to make it.’

But, she said: ‘I would like to  go back to the gym to help me recover...I’m just disappointed, really disappointed that a man of his standing and a national club can behave in such a vindictive  and petty way.’

A spokesman for the Bannatyne Group said: ‘The lady’s membership was revoked because she  was disruptive.’

He added: ‘The group supports numerous cancer charities and sympathises with the plight of cancer sufferers.’
