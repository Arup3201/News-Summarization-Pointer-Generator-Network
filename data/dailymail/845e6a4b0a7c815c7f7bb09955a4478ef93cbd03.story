They suffered a 22-0 defeat and have conceded 120 goals in 16 games, failing to win a single point.

But Amory Green Rovers, who are bottom of division seven in the Devon and Exeter Saturday league, have no problem being called the worst footballers in Britain - because they are the nicest.

In fact, the Christian team claim it is their gentle approach that has led to their poor performance amid the rough and tumble of the amateur game.

God on their side: Amory Green Rovers are at the bottom of division seven in the Devon and Exeter Saturday legaue - but manager Marc Hodsdon (centre) says his Christian team is probably the nicest in Britain

Manager Marc Hodsdon, a  forklift delivery driver, was fiercely competitive when he started the team ten years ago, but said he changed tack after he found God.

Now he recruits players of all abilities and focuses on their sporting attitude - which has led them to avoid getting a single yellow or red card.

The 33-year-old said: 'We are absolutely shocking to be fair. We could well be Britain's worst football team - but we are certainly the nicest.

'We always do the best we can and try to win, but we have lost 22-0 and 17-0 already this season. We have had some right annihilations.'

Badge: The team was competitive when it began ten years ago, but changed its approach to sport

He said when he started the team in 2005: 'We got promoted a few times but then I gave it up to have children. I came back into it last season but I wanted to do it a bit differently.

'I had found faith while I had been away and for us it is not about relegations and promotions any more.

'We had to clear up the debt but managed to get a good sponsorship. But it is not just about the winning any more. We just wanted the guys out there to play football.

'Throughout the course of their life many of them have been picked on and we have a couple of boys who have Aspergers Syndrome.

'Their confidence has been affected throughout their life - but they genuinely take comfort from playing football.'

Mr Hodsdon said running the team according to his Christian ethos is more important than winning - a philosophy which has not suited everyone.

'There are some myths about being a Christian team which meant I had to recruit some new players,' he said. 'Not everyone respected what we were trying to do.

'We are quite competitive in a sense but we are open to everyone whatever their footballing ability.

'The most important thing about the team is about giving people somewhere to get out and socialise.'

Despite the team's appalling record this season, Mr Hodsdon said it was probably the happiest in the league. 

'Last Wednesday we lost 15-1 in our local derby yet we walked off the pitch being the happier team,' he said.

'Some of the players on the other side were still arguing among themselves and just not enjoying it - that is not what football is about.

'We have had a lot of praise from the league for our sporting attitude. We have never had any sending off and we never abuse the ref. Our attitude is always spot on.

Relaxed: The manager said: 'Last Wednesday we lost 15-1 in our local derby yet we walked off the pitch being the happier team. Some of the players on the other side were still arguing among themselves'

'We always shake the hands of the other team.'

Off the pitch the team does charity work, including a sponsored swim for a church-run housing organisation in Tiverton, Devon, where Mr Hodsdon lives. 

'You don't have to be a Christian to be part of the team - far from it,' he added. 'But you do have to buy into the ethos of what we are trying to create.

'I am getting a lot of support even though we are continuing to lose and I take a lot of comfort in that.

'We give opportunities to players and people who know they are not blessed with talent - but they genuinely love the game.'
