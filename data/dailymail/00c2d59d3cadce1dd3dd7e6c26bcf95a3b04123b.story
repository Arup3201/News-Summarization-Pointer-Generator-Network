The 1,082ft cruise ship set to be named by the Duchess of Cambridge has been unveiled ahead of today's launch with a set of images that reveal the lavish interior and impressive rooms of the multimillion pound boat.

Named the Royal Princess, the latest ship to be built by Princess Cruises certainly lives up to its regal name.

Due to be launched in a traditional naming ceremony, the spectacular cruiser has everything the well-heeled guest could possibly want, including a fully-equipped games room, casino and a spa.

The Royal Princess also has a 28ft glass-bottomed viewing gallery, 10 different restaurants including one that specialises in steak and lobster, and 1,780 luxury staterooms.

The vessel arrived in Southampton last week from the Italian shipyard in Montefalcone where she was built, and was met with a rousing welcome from the Southampton University Brass Band, who played God Save The Queen as the ship hove into view.

The welcoming serenade was answered by the Royal Princess which boasts a specially made horn that plays the first notes of the theme song from the television show The Love Boat.

At the naming ceremony, the Duchess of Cambridge will see performances from Natasha Bedingfield and West End singer Kerry Ellis before officially christening the ship - now the largest in Princess Cruises' 16-strong fleet, although it will be joined by a similarly sized sister ship, Regal Princess, next year.

The Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines 
Portsmouth and The Pipe Band of 1st Battalion Irish Guards will open the
event.

Despite the ship's regal name, the vessel was not named after the Duchess of Cambridge. Instead, the name was taken from the original Royal Princess ship which launched in 1984 and is no longer in service.

'Appointing a godmother to name a new ship is one of maritime’s oldest traditions,' said Paul Ludlow, UK Director of Princess Cruises.

'Historically their role is to be entrusted with the safe guidance of a vessel and its passengers. We are thrilled to welcome HRH Duchess of Cambridge, godmother to Royal Princess, to Southampton and look forward to celebrating this historic occasion.'

After the naming ceremony, the 3,600-passenger Royal Princess will depart on her maiden voyage, which will take her round the coastline of Spain to Barcelona, via Vigo, Lisbon, Gibraltar and Malaga.

From Barcelona, the ship will embark on a 12-day voyage around the Mediterranean before a longer 30-day cruise that will take it across the Atlantic to the sunny Florida city of Fort Lauderdale.

It will then depart on a five-day Caribbean cruise that takes in Princess Cays in the Bahamas, the pretty island of St Maarten, the British Virgin Islands and St. Thomas before returning to the American port.

Among with the spa and the casino, lucky travellers able to cough up the £1,508 price tag for the 12-day trip or £2,632 for the longer voyage, will be able to enjoy luxury suites that have their own 37" flat screen television, 100 per cent Egyptian cotton bed linen and deluxe en suite bathrooms.

Other special features include plush private poolside cabanas that appear to be 
floating on water, a 'Princess Live!' television studio and what Princess Cruises describe as the 'largest
pastry shop at sea'.
