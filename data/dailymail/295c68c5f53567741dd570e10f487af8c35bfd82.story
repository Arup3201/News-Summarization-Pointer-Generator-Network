By Friday evening, a picture posted on Instagram by Steven Gerrard, standing next to Jamie Redknapp, had received more than 100,000 likes. It included the message: ‘Learnt so much from this fella coming through, great to see a good mate of mine’.

Redknapp was in Liverpool’s midfield when Gerrard played in his first Merseyside derby, as a rampaging substitute in April 1999. 

Together again at the club’s training ground to record an interview that will appear in Jamie’s Saturday Night Football programme on Sky, they had plenty of catching up to do as Gerrard prepares for his last match at Goodison Park. Sportsmail’s Lee Clayton listened in …

Redknapp interviews the Liverpool captain for Sky's Saturday Night Football programme before the derby

Jamie: It is your 33rd derby. How much are you looking forward to it?

Steven: More than ever. It is my favourite game of the season. I enjoy winning at Old Trafford, but Everton is closer. I can feel the hate, the bitterness. If there is one ground where I could pick a win, it is Goodison Park. They are great supporters — and I have a lot of respect for them — but for the hell they give me, this is the place.

Jamie: I was playing in your first derby . . . you came on as a sub and played at right back. My dad said afterwards: ‘Your right back can play.’ I said: ‘Wait until you see him play in central midfield, dad!’

Steven: I felt like a kid invited to a man’s game. I looked like a kid and I played like a kid in many ways. When I cleared one off the line, I celebrated like I had scored the winning goal! Being a local lad, I grew up around the derby. My dad is a massive red and my mum’s brother is a massive blue. So for years and years, even before I sampled it for myself, I loved the games. To get a win in that first game (Liverpool won 3-2), it felt like a cup final to me.

Jamie: You were sent off in your second derby in September of that year for a poor tackle on Kevin Campbell. Good news: Kevin is only just off his crutches!

Steven: That tackle was so bad, I could have been sent off twice. I went out for dinner that night and who should be in the same restaurant? Kevin Campbell. He was a big unit and I wouldn’t fancy a one-on-one with him off the pitch. He put his arm around me, he was great, but my emotion got the better of me in that game. That’s the key to derby games; don’t play with your fire. It will start at a ferocious pace, the tackles will be flying . . . when you played, Jamie, referees would let a bit go in the derbies, but not now. You can get booked for nothing.

Jamie: Liverpool seem to be in good form and players like Raheem Sterling have a role to play. Now and in the future.

Steven: Liverpool need to sign up Raheem now. And Jordan Henderson too. When I was coming through, once I had a couple of years remaining, my contract would be renewed to avoid the worry. I see Jordan with a year left and Raheem’s (contract situation) in the paper too much and I know there is no smoke without fire. My message to the club is: get these done. Sharpish. Sterling, Henderson, Sturridge and Coutinho, who has just signed, are the future of this club. I want to watch them delivering trophies for Liverpool. I should mention Jordon Ibe to you too.

Jamie: I’ve just been watching him in training. He’s got a bit of Daniel Sturridge about him . . .

Steven: He’s got everything. He’s got a bit of Sturridge and Sterling rolled into one and if he keeps listening to the right people, he will be one for England.

Jamie: That good?

Steven: Yeah.

Jamie: It is sounds very bright for the future, so why are you leaving?

Steven: I am part of it all until the end of the season and I hope to be back in some capacity. I want to step out and look in from the outside. I’ll only become a manager if I feel I’m good enough. For the next three, four, five years I want to learn. I only know about Liverpool and England, but I want to open up, learn other methods, see new things. I played for Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez and Fabio Capello (among others) and I have notes of tactics and formations, but I need to see for myself too. It kills me to think I’m going to move away from all this, but I am excited about the challenges ahead, even if I feel a little sad too.

Jamie: And you can lower your golf handicap . . .

Steven: I don’t want anyone in America to think I am going to take it easy. I want to start games, score goals.

Jamie: When you announced you are leaving, people assumed there must be a problem with Brendan Rodgers.

Steven: Jamie, you’d have loved to play for him. I wish I could have worked with him in my prime. I believe I would have a couple of medals that I sorely miss — Premier League title medals. I’m sure he will deliver at this club. The players love him. His work is fresh, it’s new. I skip into training. There isn’t a problem with him at all, our relationship is strong. I’ve just spent 20 minutes with him and we are going out for dinner soon to discuss my plans for the future. I wish I could have played for him for 10 years, at my best.
