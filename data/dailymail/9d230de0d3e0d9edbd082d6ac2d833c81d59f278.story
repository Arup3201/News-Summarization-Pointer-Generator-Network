Rail bosses have been forced to take action after confused tourists kept turning up at a railway station called Abbey Road expecting to find the famous Beatles zebra crossing.

Transport for London decided to erect a tongue-in-cheek notice to inform baffled visitors that they've come to the wrong place.

The genuine iconic crossing - which featured on the cover of The Beatles' album of the same name - is actually more than 10 miles away in the suburb of St Johns' Wood near the recording studios where it was recorded.

Wrong direction: The Abbey Road in the East End is not quite as famous as its namesake in St John's Wood

Iconic: The cover of The Beatles 1969 album Abbey Road featuring the Fab Four

But local commuters say scores of hapless tourists regularly turn up at the East End station assuming it must be home to the famous Abbey Road.

The gently mocking sign explains that
 tourists who may have arrived expecting to find the famous crossing are
 in the wrong place and explains how to get backÂ  to the correct 
location.

Several of the 
most famous Beatles songs including 'Daytripper', 'Help', 'Get Back' and 'Ticket to Ride' are cleverly weaved into the sign which has been placed
 in the station entrance by one of the platforms.

Light-hearted: Transport for London recently erected this sign in an effort to explain to confused tourists who arrive in the wrong place

Tourists who turned up asking locals 
for directions expressed their amusement at the 
sign yesterday - after getting over the initial disappointment at being at the 
wrong station.

Adrijana Maric, 30, who was visiting London from Bulgaria, said: 'It's pretty confusing.

'How is somebody who has never been to this country before know which one is which?

'I do like the sign though - it is very British humour.'

While oversees IT student Nanja Alma, 21, added: 'It's the only Abbey Road on the tube map, so I just assumed it was here.

'I love the sign though, it kind of softens the blow of being 10 miles the wrong direction.'

Local business owners did ask 
Transport for London to change the name of the DLR station to put
 an end to the confusion when it opened in 2011.

Alex Lonsdale, 33, who lives 
in West Ham, said: 'It's been quite annoying actually - the station is 
always full of baffled tourists wandering around.

'I suppose you've got to laugh at it though and it looks like that is what Tfl have done.

'It makes a nice change to signs constantly telling you about engineering works, that's for sure.'

A Transport for London spokesperson said: 'Some visitors to London have been taking the name of the DLR station as indicating the location of the Abbey Rd recording studio made famous by the Beatles and their album, Abbey Road.

'This poster displayed at the station will help them find their way to where they want to be.

'We hope the humour in it may help alleviate their dismay at finding themselves so far off course as they realise they are not the only ones to have made the mistake.'

The Abbey Road crossing was recently voted the number one 'must see' Beatles site in the UK on TripAdvisor.

Not so famous: The DLR station in east London opened in 2011. Business owners complained at the time that it should be named something else to avoid the confusion
