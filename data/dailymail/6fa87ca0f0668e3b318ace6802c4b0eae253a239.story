Two women have been killed in attacks at lawyers' offices in Düsseldorf, west Germany today.

The victims were struck down in two separate attacks, and police later arrested a 48-year-old Shanghai-born man who they said had dealings with both offices.

The fatal attacks took place within 90 minutes of each other, at two separate lawyers' offices, and also saw two men injured.

Killings: Police officers are seen at one of the lawyers' offices where a woman died after a man who allegedly had dealings with the lawyers attacked

The first attack took place at a lawyers' office in Düsseldorf, where a man stabbed a woman to death and injured a man, before reportedly also using a firearm and then set a fire, prosecutor Christoph Kumpa told reporters.

The suspect had a dispute with a lawyer in the office, police later confirmed, but did not reveal the identity of the victim.

About 90 minutes later, a lawyer's assistant was shot dead at an office in Erkrath, some nine miles away, and another man was injured.

According to police, the arrested man's legal case had been referred to the Erkrath office.

Captured: A Shanghai-born 48-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of carrying out both killers, and he later confessed to the attacks

Under arrest: It is believed that the male suspect had dealings with both of the lawyers's offices

Police launched a massive manhunt and arrested the man Friday afternoon in Goch, near the Dutch border, after he forced his way into a pizza restaurant - setting off a scuffle in which two people were lightly injured.

Kumpa said the suspect apparently had a score to settle with the restaurant's owner.

Officials identified the suspect only as Yanquing T., in keeping with German privacy rules.

They said the 48-year-old, who was born in Shanghai and lived in Düsseldorf, admitted the attacks.
