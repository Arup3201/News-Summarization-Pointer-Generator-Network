A rare lizard survived a 3,000-mile flight in a freezing
cold luggage hold only to then be put through the wash by an unsuspecting
holidaymaker.

Company director Sue Banwell-Moore had returned from a
trip to the Cape Verde islands, off the coast of Western Africa, with a friend when she found the brown 6in
(15cm) long Chioninia lizard among her washing.

Ms Banwell-Moore said after the initial shock, she realised
it must have stowed away in her suitcase and travelled all the way back to her
house in Churchinford, near Taunton, Somerset.

Sue Banwell-Moore had returned from a trip to the Cape Verde islands, off the coast of Western Africa, with a friend when she found the brown 6in (15cm) long Chioninia lizard among her washing

Ms Banwell-Moore said after the initial shock, she realised 'Larry' must have stowed away in her suitcase and travelled all the way back to her house in Churchinford, near Taunton, Somerset

She said she has since grown rather fond of the lizard,
which she has named Larry.

'I got home on the Tuesday and it was snowy in the Blackdown
Hills, and we got back in the early hours of the morning so it wasn't until the
next day when I did a couple of loads of washing that I found him,' she said.

'I put the first lot out and then when I put the second lot
out on to the clothes horse to dry, I looked down and there was this lizard on
the floor. It was just sort of there.

'I did scream, I was just so shocked, I couldn't believe how
it had got there, on my floor, and was wondering if it was going to run all
around the room.

'I phoned my daughter and said "I've got a lizard on my
floor", and I was screaming and she was just screaming but with laughter.

'I touched it and it didn't move - it was very cold - and I
thought maybe it was dead.'

After covering the lizard with a saucepan for her son to
pick up later, she took a 'little peek' and to her surprise found he had moved.

Larry survived a few scrapes on his journey from Cape Verde, left, to Somerset, right

'I thought "Oh my God, he's alive",' Ms Banwell-Moore said.

'My friend was around and he picked him up and held him in
his hand and he stroked him and he sort of came to life.

'We kept him all night in the box and kept the heating up
all night to keep him warm.'

Ms Banwell-Moore said she was worried the lizard would not
make it through the night, but in the morning he seemed to be doing well.

'He put his little head up, like he was reacting to my
voice,' she said.

'I was just so pleased that he was doing well.'

After the initial shock had passed, Ms Banwell-Moore said she
had fallen in love with Larry after realising just what the reptile had gone
through.

Larry has now completed the last part of his journey - 25 miles from Churchinford to the Tropiquaria Wildlife Park in Watchet, Somerset, where he will spend the rest of his days

'He had been in the hold of the aeroplane, through the
delicate cycle of my washing machine, he went through quite an ordeal, but he
is so sweet.

'I realised what the poor thing had been through, and I sort
of fell in love with him.'

She added that while on the island of Sal - one of the most
northerly of the islands off the western coast of Africa - she had only ever
seen one lizard.

'It's very, very barren - beautiful beaches, but has very
little in the way of vegetation or wildlife,' Ms Banwell-Moore said.

'I only ever saw one lizard on the beach and that was the
day before I left and I was watching him and that was that.'

Larry has now completed the last part of his journey - 25
miles from Churchinford to the Tropiquaria Wildlife Park in Watchet, where he
will spend the rest of his days.

The keepers at the park have been keeping a close eye on the
lizard after fears the washing powder could have affected his breathing.

But the park's director Chris Moiser, who said since taking
over Tropiquaria four years ago he had wanted to move the collection in a
slightly more African direction, said he jumped at the chance of giving Larry a
new home.

'It is very rare - Cape Verde islands is one of those places
with native species found nowhere else in the world, it's so remote,' he said.

'We have it down to one of two species but to tell the
difference between these we need to carefully count some of the small facial
scales, which is rather difficult on a relatively small lizard, which moves at
speed.'
