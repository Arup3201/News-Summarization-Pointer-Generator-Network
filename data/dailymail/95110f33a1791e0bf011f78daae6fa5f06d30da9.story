A man has been sentenced to eight years in prison for online messages criticising the ruling Chinese Communist Party and trying to form an opposition party to it.

The court in the southwestern city of Kunming sentenced Cao Haibo, 27 for 'subversion of state power'.

Cao had called for democracy and had tried to form a party called the 'China Republican Party'.

The charge is more serious than one of incitement of subversion, which is more typically used against party critics.

Cao's lawyer Ma XiaopengÂ believes the sentence was too harsh. 'Cao Haibo does not understand politics in China,' he explained.

'We think he's an immature child; he really did not know that the party would take it this seriously.'

Ma said that Cao's party had only 
existed for one day online. Cao, who was running an Internet cafe, is 
not a prominent dissident.

The sentence signals the party's 
resolve to crack down hard on dissent, especially as it readies for a 
power handover at the Communist Party congress.

The congress begins on November 8 and 
will see new leaders appointed to run China for the next decade, the 
country with the world's biggest population and second largest economy.

President Hu Jintao is due to hand over his party chief position to anointed successor Xi Jinping.

The party has always moved swiftly to crush opposition to its 63-year monopoly on power.

Defendants facing subversion charges in China's party-run courts are almost never acquitted.

An extreme set of rules has
been put in place as Beijing tightens security measures before the congress.

Some of the more bizarre include not 
rolling down taxi windows, not purchasing a remote-controlled plane 
without the permission of a police chief and not releasing your pigeons.

China is notorious for tightening 
security measures before large events, for instance restricting air 
traffic during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This once-a-decade transition has often caused unrest.

Human rights groups report that activists and petitioners are being rounded up ahead of the congress.

And these broader security measures illustrate how China is trying to leave absolutely no room for disruptions.

Kitchen knives and pencil sharpeners reportedly have been
pulled from shop shelves, and there's even a rumour that authorities are on the
lookout for seditious messages scribbled on ping pong balls.

The government has blocked searches for the phrase 'party
congress' on websites including China's popular Twitter-like Sina Weibo.

Internet posters manage to get around that by using
characters that sound like 'party congress.'

Taxi drivers have been told to remove window handles and
require passengers to sign a 'traveling agreement' promising to avoid sensitive
parts of the city and not to open their windows or doors if they pass
'important venues.'

A man who answered the phone at Wan Quan Si taxi company in
the south of the capital said the rule applies to all taxi companies in
Beijing. He declined to give his name.

Beijing investment company worker Li Tianshu said she didn't
believe colleagues' claims that window handles had been removed until she got
into a taxi herself the other day.

'There were no handles for three of the four windows,' she
said. 'The driver told me that their company asked them to do it to prevent
passengers spreading leaflets.

'The driver complained that if they don't take the handles
away or the passengers throw leaflets out of the taxis, they will be fired.'

Citizens have taken to Weibo to post photos of doors with
handles crudely ripped off. Liu Shi, a client manager in a mass communication
company, wrote that the taxi driver had told him that power to electronic
window buttons would also be cut.

A memo circulating on Weibo warned taxi drivers to be on
guard against passengers who may want to cast balloons with slogans or throw
'ping pong balls with reactionary words.'

It was unclear who issued the memo and its authenticity
could not be confirmed.

Police in the capital are asking that Chinese citizens show
their ID cards and foreigners their passports when buying remote-controlled
model aircraft over safety concerns, The Global Times reported on Tuesday.

Hold on to your pigeons: Keeping birds at home is just one of the strange rules

One toy store owner said authorities had told him to stop
selling medium and large-sized planes.

'This kind of plane can't fly over long distances and it can
hardly carry anything,' said Chen Ziping, holding up a model about half a yard
long.

'They just told me to stop selling it and I have to follow
the order.'

The Global Times reported an unnamed police officer from
Aoyuncun station in Chaoyang district said people wanting to buy
model planes during the congress should go to the vendor's local police station
to register.

Only when the buyer receives approval from the station's police
chief can he make the purchase.

You are not allowed to fly model planes in the city and
balloons also are on the blacklist.

The newspaper cited another officer from
Chaoyang district Public Security Bureau saying pigeon owners must keep
their birds in their coops during the congress.

Standing guard: There is a strong security presence in the city

Chen Jieren had a run-in with the security rules Sunday
after the handle of his knife broke while he was cooking dinner. He took his ID
card to the supermarket, knowing that people must show identification when
buying knives during sensitive periods.

'Well, it didn't work this time,' Chen said. 'I was told by
the police that no more knives can be sold, not even pencil sharpeners.

'And I
don't think the shopkeeper was kidding, because several days ago I saw myself
that police were asking the sales assistants in the stationer's not to sell
pencil sharpeners.

'I went back and got an old knife and tried to sharpen it. I
guess I have to live with it until the congress finishes,' he added.

Wang Ye, an engineer from Beijing who lives in Shanghai, was
planning on returning to his home city to run a marathon, but it was postponed
with no word on when it might be held.

The date of a marathon in the eastern city of Hangzhou, near
Shanghai, was also changed.

'There is no official explanation, but we all know that it is
due to the 18th Congress,' he said.

History: The congress has been troublesome in the past

'I guess I will give up running competitions in China and
try to attend more abroad,' said Wang.

'At least they tell me the schedule one year before the
event.'

On Thursday the process begins with the opening of the
Central Committee, the roughly 370-member body that is finalising preparations
for the congress.

Past examples of trouble surrounding the congress include Bo
Xilai, once a candidate for the all-powerful Politburo's Standing Committee,
suffering a spectacular fall from grace in which his wife was convicted of
murder.

One of President Hu Jintao's closest aides was also forced
to step down after his son was killed alongside two partially dressed women in
an accident in his Ferrari.

Meanwhile, protests over pollution, land seizures and local
corruption continue across the country.
