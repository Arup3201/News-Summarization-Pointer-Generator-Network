England’s players risk being struck down with sickness ahead of their World Cup opener against Italy having begun a course of medication to prevent malaria.

The 23-man squad will take tablets for 12 days in a bid to combat the disease, which is particularly prevalent in the north of Brazil and in Manaus where the Three Lions kick off their campaign on Saturday.

But the antimalarial drug Malarone causes side effects which include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and headaches. And with one in 10 people usually affected, there is a danger that some of Roy Hodgson’s men could take ill over the coming days.

Risk: One in ten people who take anti-malaria tablets are affected by sickness

Prevention: England's players began their 12-day course of tablets on Tuesday

Very common: More than 1 in 10 people who take Malarone

- diarrhoea- headaches- nausea- stomach pain- vomiting

Common: More than 1 in 100 people who take Malarone

- abnormal laboratory test results- allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions- blood problems- cough- depression- difficulty sleeping- feeling dizzy- fever- itching- loss of appetite- metabolic problems- skin rash or rashes- strange dreams

Uncommon: More than 1 in 1000 people who take Malarone

- feeling anxious- hair loss- inflammation of the mouth- palpitations- urticaria

Rare: More than 1 in 10,000 people who take Malarone

- hallucination

No choice: Roy Hodgson accepts his players must take the medication

The England boss, however, would rather his players suffered the side effects than contract malaria.

‘It’s
 a question for the doctors really: I went to Manaus and I didn’t take 
any for the two days I spent there,’ said Hodgson, whose staff will also
 take the medication.

‘That might just be something to do with the fact that I’m not a football player. As far as I’m concerned, I’ve got to go with medical opinion.

'If the doctors are telling me that, when we go to Manaus, the players must take malaria tablets, whether it has side effects or not, what do I do?

'I can’t turn around and say: “We will not take malaria tablets” because the bottom line is it’s better to have stomach cramps or whatever it is for one player in 10 than have someone contract malaria, because that would be unthinkable.’
