Dual Irish champion jockey Barry Geraghty, whose 31 wins at the National Hunt Festival in March include all big three prizes – the Champion Hurdle, Champion Chase and Gold Cup, gives his assessment of the early clues for this season’s meeting.

Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds looks worthy of taking his place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March but the one I took from the race was Djakadam even though he finished eighth.

He is gorgeous, progressive horse and I am a big fan.

The ground was a bit too soft for my mount, Triolo D’Alene, who was pulled up. On that going, over three miles and a quarter miles in a competitive handicap at Newbury, ideally you need to have had a run under your belt or be very, very fit.

Djakadam, on his seasonal debut, travelled well until fading in the last two furlongs. He looked like a horse who would improve an awful lot for the run. 

He might have been very unlucky at last season’s Festival when he fell and the fact that trainer Willie Mullins pitched him into a race like the Hennessy tells you a lot.

Venetia Williams’ Hennessy runner-up Houblon Des Obeaux also ran a great race but appreciated the soft ground and you would have to question whether he would be as effective on better ground when assessing future prospects.

Jockey Barry Geraghty will ride Bobs Worth in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on December 28

I am looking forward to riding Bobs Worth in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on December 28. He won it last year like a class horse. For me, it was as good a run as his 2013 Gold Cup win.

I’d like to think my possible mount Simonsig would be good enough to make the frame in the big Christmas chase in Britain, the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day.

But, even if he is ready to run, I’m not sure it is the right option for him for a first race of the season.

Paul Nicholls-trained Silviniaco Conti looks a worthy favourite to win for a second year. He won Haydock’s Betfair Chase like a horse who had a bit in hand.

Unbeaten Faugheen is favourite for the Champion Hurdle but should he really be at the head of the pecking order? Probably not.

He has been very impressive but hasn’t beaten a true Champion Hurdle contender yet.

Putting that into context, last year’s third The New One has done all he has been asked in his two runs this season. Jezki, who I won the race on last season, was beaten by Hurricane Fly in his comeback but generally improves for running. There won’t be any panic in his camp yet.

Never judge a horse on one day. So I would not draw too drastic a conclusion on my World Hurdle winner More Of That losing his unbeaten record in Newbury’s Long Distance Hurdle.

The hurdles’ track was a good bit softer than the chase track and his opposition included race-fit rivals.

If you take a horse out of his comfort zone, it is very easy to get him beaten and he looked out of his comfort zone a lot of the way.

If he has is a little breathing issue, I’m sure they will correct it but I would doubt he has lost the class he showed last season.

It is hard to find fault with Mullins-trained Valseur Lido’s win in Sunday’s Grade One Drinmore Novices’ Chase. That was the most impressive performance from a novice chaser I’ve seen this season. I won on John Ferguson’s Parlour Games at last month’s Cheltenham meeting and, at this stage, he is the novice hurdler which has made most impression on me.
