They say you don’t get much for your money these days – but a Scottish holiday home has just gone on the market for a pound.

The one-bedroom flat in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, valued at £20,000, is coming up for auction at the end of the month, making it almost certainly the cheapest flat in Britain.

Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said: ‘It was my late husband’s property and we are looking for a quick sale.

Location, location, location: This one-bed flat on the holiday island of Bute, Scotland, is coming up for auction for just £1, despite being valued at around £20,000

Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said the flat belonged to her late husband and the family chose the low asking price because they are looking for 'a quick sale'

‘It has been in his family for a long time, but it is a lovely flat and would make someone a very nice little holiday home.’

The sandstone property is in Rothesay town centre, close to the 13th century castle and a five-minute walk from the harbour – although it does not offer sea views.

Auction House Scotland will put the property under the hammer in Glasgow at 2pm on March 26.

The company’s website describes the auction sale as ‘an excellent opportunity to purchase a Scottish holiday home or a buy-to-let investment for only £1’. 

Auction House Scotland says the property has a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows

The town of Rothesay, where the property is located, is close to a 13th century castle and a five minute walk from the harbour which has ferries to Wemyss Bay

It adds: ‘The surrounding area presents ample local shops, a golf course, beautiful Scottish scenery and great access to ferry links to Wemyss Bay.’

The traditional second-floor flat has a large lounge, kitchen, shower room and bedroom, with gas central heating and double-glazed windows.

Gillian Cochrane of Auction House Scotland said: ‘We’re expecting a big turnout, there’s been a lot of interest so far. It was our idea to put the guide price at £1.

‘The reason we did that is, firstly, you get a lot of interest; and secondly, the sellers just want a fast and final sale.

Market experts believed the flat could be rented out for around £364 per month, or could provide a nice holiday home for whoever snaps it up

Auctioneers say the guide price of just £1 has attracted a lot of interest so far, and they are expecting the property to be snapped up quickly on March 26

‘When the hammer falls, it’s a done deal. Whereas if you are buying from an estate agent, it can drag on – about 30 per cent of estate agent deals fall through

‘The flat can be a place you can go to for a short break, or you can rent it out.’

Market experts said the flat could be rented out at £364 per month.
