Sporadic outages of BlackBerry messaging and email today spread to the U.S. and Canada - as problems with the smartphone stretched into the third day for Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa.

U.S. users were reporting that their BlackBerrys weren't getting email on Wednesday morning, as widespread problems added to the woes of Canadian manufacturer Research In Motion.

RIM yesterday admitted a crucial link in its infrastructure had failed - and a backup didn't work either - with the under-fire company now working as quickly as it can to get through a backlog of traffic.

This isn't the first time Research in Motion has suffered messaging outages with BlackBerry.

Its BlackBerry Messenger service went offline in Canada and Latin America last month and a massive disruption hit North America in 2007.

But these disruptions are usually contained within one continent or region - whereas in the latest outage they have hit four continents.

RIM has not yet said when the outage will be fully resolved or how many people are affected.

The firm is suffering from slowing sales and a tablet that has been a dud, while its shares are approaching a five-year low.

But there are still about 70 million BlackBerry users around the world. Analysts now estimate that 
up to half of them may be affected.

‘The resolution of this service issue is our number one priority right now and we are working night and day to restore all BlackBerry services to normal levels,’ the company said today.

In the United Arab Emirates, the two biggest phone companies said they would compensate their BlackBerry users for the mishap by giving them at least three days of free service.

Matthew Willsher, chief marketing officer for Etisalat, the country's biggest telecom, said it was acting in response to the 'exceptional and unprecedented circumstances'.

Unlike other mobile phone makers, RIM handles email and messaging traffic to and from its phones, so when it encounters a problem, millions of subscribers are affected at once.

Attempts to solve the problem are focusing on a ‘core switch’ failure at BlackBerry’s data centre in Slough, Britain. The core switch is the backbone of the service.

It operates like a hi-tech postal sorting office, receiving millions of emails and messages every minute and directing them to the correct recipient.

When it fails, a back-up system should kick in, but that did not happen. With every hour, a huge backlog of data builds up - and that is causing the company huge problems.

One of the big attractions of the 
BlackBerry for overseas users is the BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, which
works like text messaging but doesn't incur extra fees. But BMM was 
affected by the outage.

The
problems could not have come at a worse time for RIM as Apple is today 
releasing software for its iPhones that works like BBM. Apple is one of 
the chief causes of RIM's diminishing fortunes.

Veteran British entrepreneur Alan Sugar,
who founded electronics company Amstrad in 1968, said he has never seen
anything like it.

‘In all my years in IT biz, I have never
seen such an outage as experienced by Blackberry,’ Lord Sugar tweeted. 
‘I can't understand why it's taking so long to fix.’

Former political spin doctor Alastair 
Campbell added: 'Some free advice. Explain while you fix. Apologise when 
you have. Recompense after.'

RIM shares fell $0.46, or 1.9 per cent, 
to $23.95 in morning trading in New York. One joke making the rounds on 
Twitter said: ‘What did the one BBM user say to the other? Nothing.’

Matt Bath, technology editor of British magazine Which, said: 'BlackBerry should be doing more to keep customers informed about the ongoing problems with its service.

'In some cases, customers have heard about the issue from their mobile network provider but have heard nothing from BlackBerry itself. That's not great customer service.'
