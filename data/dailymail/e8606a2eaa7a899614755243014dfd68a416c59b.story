Cleared: Steven Lock was found not guilty of ABH

A mother whose jeweller lover was cleared of assaulting her in a Fifty Shades-inspired sex game has told how he lashed her with a knotted rope if she didn't address him as 'Sir' or 'Master'.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had agreed to take part in a slave sex session with Steven Lock but said he went too far, forcing her to say 'Yes Sir, Yes Master', and whipping her if she didn't, leaving her screaming in pain.

Last week Mr Lock, 43, from Ipswich, was cleared of causing her actual bodily harm after a jury heard that the woman had written to him promising to be his 'slave' and accepting that she might suffer 'pain'.

But today his former lover, a divorcee who met him through a dating website, said the pain she suffered at his semi-detached home was worse than that she felt giving birth.

She told how Mr Lock tied her to an eyelet on the floor of his bedroom and lashed her with a knotted rope that made a whistling sound as he cracked it through the air.

The woman, who met him on plentyoffish.com and agreed to the sex session after they both read the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, said that the first and last of the 14 strokes he administered hurt the most.

She said: 'I screamed after the first one then I tried not to, as I knew this would only encourage him - he seemed to get off on my screams...

'He counted out the lashing, relishing every one, but apart from the counting he was silent.'

The woman, a brunette, told The Sun that Mr Lock, who had previous convictions for domestic violence, stood sideways on to her to administer the excruciating strokes, using his full force with each one.

She said she was whipped once for each occasion on which she had 'failed as a slave', adding: 'I'd have to say "Yes Sir, Yes Master", and if I didn't, I'd get lashed.'

Lonely hearts: Mr Lock and the woman met through the dating website plentyoffish.com

Ipswich Crown Court heard during the trial that Mr Lock agreed he had put a chain around her wrist and tied her to the floor.

After the whipping, the couple had sex and then Mr Lock went off to the kitchen to make a chicken wrap, the woman said.

Left manacled to the floor, she sent a text to a friend asking them to call the police.

The court heard the text read: 'He has got me chained up like a dog.

'He is whipping the s*** out of me.  I need your help bad.'

Police found her in a 'distressed' state outside Mr Lock's home, and the court heard that he had released her after she refused to share his bed.

She said they had had a codeword, 'red' to use if either of them wanted to stop the sex session, but said it all happened so fast, she didn't even think of using it.

The woman said Mr Lock angrily gave her the key to the padlock and she fled to the bus-stop, while he sent her an angry text message.

The inspiration: Erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey

She said she'd been attracted by his online profile which showed him to be attractive, responsible and in a job.

She fell under his spell, like the heroine Anastasia Steel did with Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades books, and although never having been into alternative sex before, soon realised her lover wanted to be more adventurous.

The woman, who had a tattoo in an intimate place saying 'This is the property of Steven Lock', said Mr Lock enjoyed tying her up and getting her to dress like a young Britney Spears - with over-the-knee socks, pigtails and short skirt.

The court cleared Mr Lock after hearing how the woman had agreed to take part in 'master and slave'-style sex session.

Echoing the contract in the Fifty Shades erotic trilogy, she sent him a letter on August 5 last year, the day before the slave session took part, agreeing 'to allow Steven Lock to use me and my body as a slave'.

The letter went on: 'I am willing to do anything my master sees fit for me to do.  This may include pain if my tasks are not completed to his satisfaction.'

During the trial Mr Lock admitted chaining and whipping the woman but said: 'It was supposed to be kinky fun'.

The court also heard that Mr Lock had four previous convictions for domestic violence against three former partners.

Outside court he said he was 'disgusted' the case had been brought to court, saying: 'I didn't do anything wrong'.
