Brave: Hero Melia, 14, has revealed what it was like to witness her parents go through a messy divorce

She was brought up by a single mother from the age of five after her drug-addicted convict father ran off with another woman.

Hero Melia, however, is not one of the thousands of children from broken homes on council estates, but the privileged granddaughter of the Marquess of Queensberry.

The aristocratic schoolgirl has become an unlikely poster girl for Broken Britain after she was chosen to speak at a conference about the ‘war zone’ that was her parents’ marriage.

‘I felt utterly at fault. It’s natural because you see your parents in love and suddenly they’re not. I just felt on my own,’ said Hero, who is now 14 and an ambassador for a children’s charity.

‘My parents divorced when I was five but didn’t completely split till I was seven and then sort of fought over me till I was nine. It meant that up until that point home was sometimes like a war zone.

‘I don’t think there’s a lot of support for children and parents during a divorce.’

Hero’s mother, Lady Alice Douglas, is the daughter of David Harrington Angus Douglas, the 12th Marquess of Queensberry. It is a dynasty with a long and distinctly chequered history.

John Douglas, the ninth Marquess of Queensberry, is notorious for his legal battle with Oscar Wilde, which led to the writer being bankrupted and charged with gross indecency.

Wilde had been in a relationship with his son, Alfred.

The official rules of boxing are also named after the ninth Marquess, who publicly endorsed changes to the sport in 1867 which largely put an end to bare knuckle fighting.

In a scandal which stunned her family, Lady Alice decided to marry an armed robber whom she met while volunteering at a prison in the mid-Nineties.

Simon Melia, who was serving a nine-year sentence, wooed her during an acting workshop at Blundeston Prison in Suffolk.

Lady Alice moved from her Notting Hill apartment to live with him in a disused church in Capel Curig, Snowdonia, and they had two children – Hero and her younger brother Tybalt, now 13.

The relationship fell apart in 2003 when she discovered her husband was addicted to drugs and was having an affair with the au pair.

Lonely: Hero told a legal conference she felt she was to blame for the breakdown of her parents' relationship

Hero, a talented harpist and singer 
who sang for the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee service at St Paul’s, 
was approached to speak in front of more than 100 lawyers at the 
conference in Leeds by charity Kids in the Middle.

They
became aware of her difficult upbringing after a family friend passed 
on a song she had written about her parents’ divorce, titled Piggy in 
the Middle.

Hero, a keen horse rider who attends Chetham’s School of 
Music in Manchester, said she blamed herself for the breakdown of her 
parents’ marriage.

‘It’s what a lot of children feel,’ she added. ‘I 
have got so many ideas having gone through it myself and I thought it 
would be good to help other people.’

Unlikely match: Hero's mother, the daughter of David Harrington Angus Douglas, the 12th Marquess of Queensberry, met her father Simon Melia while volunteering at a prison where he was serving time for robbery. The couple are pictured together in 2002 shortly after Hero was born

Falling apart: But their relationship ran into difficulties when Lady Alice discovered her husband, pictured together in 2002, was addicted to drugs

Lady Alice, whose own parents 
split when she was four, said her divorce had been an ‘absolutely 
horrific’ experience. ‘I was a Marquess’s daughter with a privileged 
upbringing, an acting career and a flat in Notting Hill. Simon was an 
armed robber serving nine years who’d grown up on a council estate,’ she
said.

‘As part of the acting workshop I ran in the prison, he played
a handsome Macbeth to my Lady Macbeth. Despite family and friends 
decrying the match, after a 15-month romance, we married. It could have 
been idyllic. The problems came when I discovered Simon’s drug habit, 
then his affair.

‘Simon and the au pair left together that same evening.’

Lady
Alice said it was important parents spent more time thinking about 
their children when fighting divorce cases in the courts. ‘Just because 
divorce is more common these days it doesn’t mean it isn’t a 
catastrophic car crash for the children involved – the fairy tale 
absolutely shatters for them when parents split up,’ she added.
