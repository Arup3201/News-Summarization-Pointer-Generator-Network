Raw sewage has been washed up on beaches in Cornwall, Hampshire and Kent, prompting fears that holidaymakers could fall ill due to contaminated waters.

The warning comes after locals and holidaymakers at Godrevy Beach in Cornwall were evacuated by lifeguards following a sewage warning over the weekend.

Surfers were ordered out of the water on Friday after the text alert from a system operated by group Surfers Against Sewage and surf classes over the weekend were cancelled or moved to other beaches as a result of the contamination.

Local surfer Rory Steadman tweeted: 'It was terrible that Godrevy Beach had to close yesterday due to raw sewage running into it and cutting our surf short.'

He later spoke to newspaper The Cornishman, explaining: 'The river that flows into the sea had turned the waves brown, the sea still isn't 100 per cent safe now, 24 hours on!'

The latest beach evacuation comes just days after nine beaches were closed in Kent due to raw sewage being released into the sea from storm drains.

The sewage discharge affected nine beaches in Thanet, Kent, which relies heavily on summer tourism, including Walpole Bay, Palm Bay, Botany Bay, Kingsgate Bay, Joss Bay, Stone Bay, Viking Bay, Louisa Bay and Dumpton Gap.

A Thanet council spokesman said: ‘We are working with the Environment Agency to reduce the impact of the spillages as much as possible and water sample tests will be carried out in the areas affected today to assess the quality of the water. Southern Water have contractors out clearing the waterline.

‘The council is keen to reassure members of the public that other beaches across the district are fully open and will advise if the area affected extends to any other beaches.’

Local sailors in Hampshire have also complained about 'toilet items' washing up on beaches near popular Hayling Island and Southsea. 

A spokesperson for Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) told MailOnline Travel that there are 31,000 sewer overflows around the UK, which are supposed to use during periods of 'heavy rain', but are increasingly used during 'rain'.

He said: 'We understand that in extreme weather events to protect property and business, they're being used far too frequently, which is disturbing.

'This is the fourth time this summer that sewage has been released at Godrevy Beach and we have had complaints about the beaches in Kent.'

The organisation also accused water companies of doing simply 'what is legally required' to rectify the situation instead of tackling it in the way that is needed.

The spokesperson also explained that when beaches look clean, the water can still contain pathogens that cause gastroenteritis, ear nose and throat infections and even E coli and hepatitis.

When raw sewage has been released into the water, the World Health Organisation advises against going into the sea for 24 to 48 hours - this is often left up to the discretion of local lifeguards.

The situation at Godrevy Beach has seen overflows upwards of 50 times a year even when it has not been considered an excessively wet year.

Officials at Eastney Cruising Association in Hampshire say they see sewage affecting the shores of Langstone Harbour and even the beach at Eastney and blamed Southern Water for releasing sewage into the water without informing people.

They want the water tested by the Environment Agency to see if it is clean enough.

Bob Evans, sailing secretary at the club, said there were sewage items regularly stuck to the sides of the boats when they return to the club.

'You pull up a fishing line and it comes up with a load of toilet paper. In the 21st century in Britain, it's not on.' 

Tony Dickson, treasurer at the club, said 'My concern is they should be informing the general public.

'My wife swims down there with my nieces. There should be notifications on the beach when the water quality is not as good as it should be and it should be paid for by Southern Water.' 

Kingsgate Bay was one of the nine beaches in Kent that were closed due to sewage just last week

Officials at Southern Water said there is 'no statutory requirement' for the company to provide flags or signs about the operation of its discharges.

This is because Langstone Harbour is not a designated bathing water. However, it does inform the Langstone Harbour Board when there is a discharge.

A spokeswoman added 'We are committed to making improvements to our storm tanks and outfall at Fort Cumberland and a £10m scheme is under way to enhance the resilience of this site.

'The first stage of this started last year and changes the way storm water enters and then passes through the tanks on the site.

'Further work to improve the robustness of the site, following the severe damage caused during a storm in 2010, is also under way. This additional work includes refurbishing the pumps and screens on site.

'These screens capture any debris within the storm water before the screened storm water is released. The additional work should be complete by the end of this year.'

She added that a £20m upgrade of Portsmouth's sewer system was due to be completed this autumn.
