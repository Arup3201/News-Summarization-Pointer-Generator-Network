Julia Bleasdale has pulled out of the Commonwealth Games, where she was due to run the 10,000 metres, because of a leg injury, Team England has announced.

The 32-year-old, who finished eighth at the London Olympics, had been due to race at Hampden Park on Tuesday.

Down and out: Julia Bleasdale has had to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games because of injury

Absent: Neither Bleasdale, left, or Jo Pavey, right, will compete in the 10,000m for England

She becomes the second English woman to withdraw from the 10,000m after Jo Pavey, who will still run the 5,000m, was replaced by Kate Avery.

Nineteen-year-old Sophie Papps has replaced Ashleigh Nelson in the 100m, with Nelson focused on competing in the 4x100m relay. Nelson is not injured, though.
