Prrivate companies who are linked to rogue private investigators will face a new inquiry, the data protection watchdog announced last night.

The Information Commissioner’s Office launched a probe after it was belatedly handed by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) a list of 98 companies and individuals who are connected to the private eyes.

It represents a major development in the so-called blue-chip hacking scandal – after months of criticism by MPs that nothing was being done.

Soca, which has come under huge pressure over its failure to investigate the firms, finally succumbed to public pressure and handed the list over at the end of last week.

The ICO will now write to the celebrities, law firms, banks and other prominent companies on the list and quiz them about what they knew about the activities of the investigators.

It will examine at least 20 files of material to see if any were aware that private investigators had been instructed and whether they knew that the four private eyes who were jailed last year after a police probe were breaking the law. However, the ICO admitted that up to a quarter of the firms allegedly involved may have been based outside the UK, raising fears many could escape prosecution.

The ICO insisted it could push for investigations by its counterparts in other countries.

Soca has for months refused to hand over the list to the ICO on the grounds that it could damage an ongoing police investigation.

But in the end, it withheld only nine names which are the subject of a separate Metropolitan Police probe, Operation Tuleta, which is looking at computer hacking.

The blue chip hacking list was drawn up during a Soca inquiry, Operation Millipede, which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year.

Home Affairs Committee Chairman Keith Vaz has called for the list to be published for the sake of the victims and because 'innuendo is always worse than full disclosure'

Its existence only emerged during an investigation by MPs.

Soca,
 the agency dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’, refused to publish it on the grounds
 it could breach privacy laws and damage commercial interests.

Soca
 have also said it would be unfair to taint these companies with 
criminality since there is no evidence. Soca director general Trevor 
Pearce said: ‘I repeat the point we are not alleging that the 
individuals or companies named on the list have or even may have 
committed a criminal offence.’

The
 agency said it always intended to pass the list to the ICO once the Met
 investigation was concluded. But its change of heart came after growing
 pressure from Parliament over a scandal that has been described as 
‘worse than phone hacking’.

Critics
 have condemned the police for doing nothing to investigate the 
blue-chip clients of companies linked to private eyes while media 
organisations faced unprecedented scrutiny.

Last
 night the ICO said it had received more than 20 files of material from 
Soca, including correspondence between clients and the private 
investigators and receipts for payments. The initial phase of the 
investigation is expected to take several months.

Last
 month the Mail revealed that 22 law firms feature on the list, 
alongside several insurance companies, financial services groups and two
 celebrities, among others.

In
 reply to James Clappison, a member of the Home Affairs Select 
Committee, Soca also admitted there were up to 100 individual victims of
 the private investigators.

Mr Pearce is to appear before the committee tomorrow, with Soca’s interim chair Stephen Rimmer.

The committee’s chairman, Keith Vaz wants an explanation as to why it has taken Soca so long to pass the information to the ICO.

He
 said it is ‘deeply concerning’ these files were only passed to the ICO 
24 hours before Mr Pearce’s appearance before the committee.

Mr
 Vaz added: ‘It is particularly puzzling given that Mr Pearce told the 
committee that he would be passing on the files to the ICO once 
Operation Tuleta, scheduled to continue until at least April 2015, was 
finalised.’
