Justice Markandey Ketju said Gandhi's religious references worked to divide the Indian people, strengthening British rule 

Mahatma Gandhi, the leader who helped lead India to independence over British rule, was actually an agent for the colonists, a top India judge has claimed.

Justice Markandey Ketju said Gandhi deliberately tried to drive a wedge between the country's Hindu and Muslim populations, helping the British to divide and rule.

The judge, who is known for making controversial statements, made his comments ahead of the unveiling of a statue of Gandhi in Parliament Square, London.

They also came as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond flies to Delhi for his first official visit, meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley, who will come to London to see the statue unveiled.

Mr Katju, 68, wrote on his personal blog: 'I submit that Gandhi was objectively a British agent who did great harm to India.

'By constantly injecting religion into politics continuously for several decades, Gandhi furthered the British policy of divide and rule.'

In a separate post on the same topic, he asks: 'Does such a man, who constantly injected religion into politics, and thereby furthered the British policy of divide and rule, deserve to be called the Father of the Nation?

He then goes on to quote from Gandhi's speeches and writings before adding: 'These are only some of the stupid, feudal ideas this "Father of our nation" had.'

He says the fact that Gandhi peppered his speeches with Hindu phrases and terms pressed Indian Muslims into creating their own separate state, Pakistan, which was founded less than a year before Gandhi was shot dead.

Mr Ketju, who has a reputation for making controversial remarks, also quoted from Gandhi's speeches and writings, before concluding: 'These are only some of the stupid, feudal ideas this "Father of our nation" had'

Mr Katju, former chairman of the Press Council of India, has a large online presence - his Facebook page has been liked nearly 100,000 times, and his blog was shared by thousands of people.

Mr Katju's father was deeply immersed in the Indian freedom movement, and he has made controversial statements on the topic in the past.

According to The Times, he once said '90 per cent of Indians are idiots' because they vote in elections based on their religion and caste, rather than on political merit.
