A 6-year-old boy was killed in Wisconsin and his mother and brother were left hospitalized after a violent shooting in a small rural town.

Police are yet to identify who gunned down Jaxon, 6, his brother Joseph and their mother Morgan Slaight about 3:20 pm Friday in Montfort, about 60 miles west of Madison. 

The three were found inside a home belonging to Morgan's sister with gunshot wounds to the head from a .22 caliber pistol, the Wisconsin State Journal Reported. 

The Slaight family — Joseph, 8, Jaxon, 6, and mother Morgan — were all found with gunshot wounds to the head in Montfort, Wisconsin. Jaxon died of his wounds, while his older brother and mom remain in the hospital

Sheriff Nate Dreckman, of Grant County, has said he would 'not rule out' a 'murder-suicide' attempt, but has not been forthcoming with details as the investigation continues, according to the State Journal.

Dreckman refused to name who shot the family but said his deputies are not seeking a suspect. He insisted there is no threat to the public at large.

The boys' father, Tyler Slaight, was in the area but did not live with them. Wisconsin police say Tyler, who resides in Tulsa, is not a suspect.

Doctors say Joseph and Morgan Slaight are both in medically induced comas.

The shooting marks a tragic turn for a family whose parents long struggled with drug addiction and once lost custody of their three children.

Just a year ago, the family were the recipients of a three-bedroom home in Tulsa that was restored by hundreds of volunteers from the region, Tulsa World reported. 

Tyler and Morgan Slaight struggled for years with methamphetamine addiction, which led to the loss of custody of their children.

Happier times: the Slaight boys smile happily with their parents back when they lived in Tulsa, two years before the tragic shooting that claimed 6-year-old Jaxon's life

They were finally able to turn their lives around and received the house as a gift from the Bethany Free Will Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, according to Tulsa World.

The Slaight's third boy was living with a relative and was not involved in the shooting.
