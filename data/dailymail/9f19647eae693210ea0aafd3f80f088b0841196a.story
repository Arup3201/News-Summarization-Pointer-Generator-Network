The body of a man who died on a Greek island 11 years ago was exhumed today, police said.

Christopher Rochester, 24, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, died after falling 40ft from a hotel balcony in Rhodes.

The exhumation was carried out to settle a long-running row over a kidney that was missing from his body when it was flown home, according to reports.

A Durham Police spokesman confirmed the body was exhumed early this morning at Ropery Lane Cemetery in Chester-le-Street.

'Our CID was working in conjunction with the Greek authorities,' he added.

Fall: Christopher Rochester who died after falling 40ft from a hotel balcony in Rhodes 11 years ago

Mr Rochester died from internal bleeding after being left unattended on a hospital trolley while on holiday in Faliraki in June 2000.

His parents won their protracted battle for justice in 2008 when one of three hospital doctors was convicted of manslaughter through negligence.

But a row has persisted over the missing organ.

Mr Rochester's mother and stepfather,
Pam and George Cummings, have long called for the Greek authorities to 
accept their son's kidney was removed illegally during the post-mortem and 
that the organ, subsequently sent to Britain, belonged to someone else, 
as revealed by a DNA test they commissioned.

They have campaigned for a separate investigation into the kidney mix-up.

The Greeks have insisted that DNA samples were inadequate and that new ones should be taken by digging up Mr Rochester's body.

Mr Cummings told the BBC: 'This is 
something we very much wanted to avoid. We believed that DNA from 
Christopher's mother would be enough to prove that the kidney they sent 
back wasn't Christopher's.

'But sadly the Greek authorities stood by their request for Christopher's body to be exhumed and to extract DNA from the source.

'The Greeks have made it as difficult as possible for us from day one.

'But when the test results come back positive, as we expect them to, the Greek authorities will have nowhere left to hide.'

Mr Rochester's mother, Pam Cummings, and stepfather, George Cummings, stayed beside his grave while the exhumation took place.

Mrs Cummings, 53, told The Journal in Newcastle: 'Never did we imagine we would ever have to go through something as horrific as this.

'We were by Chris's grave during the exhumation because we wanted to be there for him.

'We laid him to rest and now the Greek authorities have forced us to disturb him.'

Tests on the kidney returned to the family by Greek authorities were carried out by the head of Newcastle University's Institute of Genetics, Professor John Burn.

Prof Burn said he established with 99 per cent certainty that the organ did not belong to Mr Rochester.

Mr Cummings, 51, told the newspaper: 'Until we get the results of the new samples taken, we can only go by the findings of Prof Burn and we remain confident that the kidney sent by the Greek authorities is not Christopher's.

'If that is the case, the Greek authorities have put this family through living hell.

'To bury your child once is a nightmare but to bury your child twice is beyond a living nightmare.'

He said if the kidney was proved not to be Mr Rochester's, the family wanted those responsible to be jailed.
