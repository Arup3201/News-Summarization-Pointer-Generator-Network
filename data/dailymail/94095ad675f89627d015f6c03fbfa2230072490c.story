Andrea Pirlo has told Manchester United to forget about the prospect of re-signing Paul Pogba and live with the grave mistake they made in allowing him to leave.

The French midfielder’s future at Juventus has been the talk of Europe for the last six months and any battle to land him is only set to intensify further.

Louis van Gaal’s United are among those interested in Pogba, who would command a fee in the region of £70million.

But Pirlo is insistent that the 21-year-old won’t be moving back to Old Trafford given Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t do enough to persuade him to remain in England.

‘For whatever reasons they chose not to give him a chance - and that is a mistake they will have to live with now,’ Pirlo said. ‘I can’t see that he (Pogba) will ever return to Manchester United.’

Real Madrid and Chelsea have also kept tabs on the youngster, whose astonishing drag and hit for Juventus in the weekend win over Chievo just typified the season he is having.

And that sort of ingenuity in possession is what has pricked up the ears of Europe’s elite – something Pirlo spotted within weeks of Pogba joining Juve three years ago.

‘When he first joined us in training at Juventus we knew there was something about him - and in just two years he has become one of the best players in the world,’ he added.

‘Of course he is going to have options - he knows that. You can’t play at the level he is and not attract attention - but he also knows that at Juventus he is already at one of the biggest clubs in Europe.

‘I have spoken with him, and told him if he carries on working hard and makes the right decisions - there is no limit to what he can achieve.’
