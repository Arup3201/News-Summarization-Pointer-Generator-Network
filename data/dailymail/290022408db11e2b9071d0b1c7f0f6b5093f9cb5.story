Over achiever: Villa picked up the La Liga title and reached the Champions League final with Atletico Madrid

Villa makes the move to America after helping Atletico Madrid win their first Primera Division title since 1996 last season and also reach the Champions League final, where they lost to Real Madrid.

Prior to joining Atletico in the summer of 2013, Spain's record goalscorer spent three hugely successful seasons at Barcelona while he has also represented Valencia, Real Zaragoza and Sporting Gijon.

Villa, who has never before played his club football outside of Spain, said during an interview posted on the Atletico website on Sunday that he was embarking on a new challenge after receiving 'an irresistible opportunity', although he did not specify what it was or where.

However, there was widespread speculation that Villa was headed to New York City and that move was confirmed on Monday.

Villa said on his new club's website, www.nycfc.com: 'Throughout my career I've always tried to keep pushing myself to achieve new targets and this represents another important goal for me.

'I want to try and help MLS continue to grow, through playing, working hard, scoring goals and at the same time try to make New York City FC become the best team in the league.

Confirmed: Villa has been named in the final 23-man squad for Spain's World Cup defence

'It's a real honour that the people 
who have formed the club have focused their attention on me. I'm keen to
 do the best I can, take on board that extra responsibility and prove my
 worth by repaying the confidence they have shown in me.'

Aside
 from his success at Atletico, Asturias-born Villa won two Primera 
Division crowns and the Champions League among a host of titles at 
Barcelona, while he also lifted the Copa del Rey with Valencia and 
Zaragoza.

For Spain, Villa, 
who is part of Vicente del Bosque's 23-man squad for this summer's World
 Cup, won the 2008 European Championships and 2010 World Cup and his 
tally of 56 goals is a national record.

New
 York City sporting director Claudio Reyna said: 'David is the perfect 
first signing for New York City FC. His individual accomplishments are 
remarkable.

'His 
experiences, including winning the 2010 World Cup, will be invaluable 
for building our club's sporting culture. I couldn't be more excited to 
welcome him to New York City and have him as our club's first player.'
