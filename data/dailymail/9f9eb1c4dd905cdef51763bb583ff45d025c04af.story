Royal Bank of Scotland has apologised for misleading a parliamentary committee over its treatment of small businesses.

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, admitted evidence given by two executives was wrong – but insisted they made an ‘honest mistake’ when discussing the controversial Global Restructuring Group before the Treasury Select Committee.

Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, said they had been ‘wilfully obtuse’.

The row over the bank’s treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, is the latest in a series of scandals for RBS since it was bailed out by the government in the financial crisis. 

Deputy chief executive Chris Sullivan and Derek Sach, head of the GRG unit, were summoned by the committee in June to discuss claims that it destroyed small firms for profit.

They flatly denied that GRG, which is now being shut down, was a ‘profit centre’.

But Mr Sullivan later wrote to Mr Tyrie to clarify – and Sir Philip has now admitted the initial evidence was wrong.

‘The evidence the bank’s representatives provided was not correct,’ he said in a letter to Mr Tyrie on August 22, made public yesterday. He added that the men ‘did not intend to mislead’.

Mr Tyrie said: ‘It was materially incorrect on a crucial point and unacceptable. RBS has done the right thing and apologised.’

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘How much more is there to come? This is a bank the state owns, having bailed them out, and we are still getting misled.’

A spokesman for RBS said: ‘The bank has apologised unreservedly for any confusion caused. This was not intentional.’
