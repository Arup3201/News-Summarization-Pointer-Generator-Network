Easy access to online pornography is wrecking adolescence for many young people, according to a new Opinium survey out today (file photo)

Easy access to online pornography is wrecking adolescence for many young people, a new survey of teenagers warns today.

The Opinium survey of 18-year-olds paints a bleak picture of teenage life where young girls and boys feel under intense pressure to conform to pornographic norms.

An astonishing 80 per cent said it was too easy to stumble across explicit images and videos on the internet.

Almost half (46 per cent) said the phenomenon of ‘sexting’, where people send explicit pictures of themselves to others, was ‘part of everyday life for teenagers nowadays’.

And a majority said pornography was making life harder for adolescents. Two-thirds of girls and almost half of boys said it would be ‘easier growing up if pornography was less easy to access for young people’.

Seventy per cent said watching porn was seen as normal among their classmates at school. One in 10 said it had become common among their peers by the age of 11.

More than half (55 per cent) said they had stumbled across images that made them ‘worried or uncomfortable’ while surfing the internet. Just one in 10 told their parents about the episodes.

The survey, commissioned by the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, found that two-thirds of those surveys believe porn is addictive.

The findings add weight to the Daily Mail’s campaign to block online porn.

Dalia Ben-Galim, associate director at the IPPR, said: ‘This new polling data shows that pornographic images are pervasive in teenagers' lives and that young women in particular are acutely conscious of how damaging they can be.

‘It paints a worrying picture about the way online pornography is shaping the attitudes and behaviour of young people. It is also clear that young people believe the sex education they currently get in school hasn't kept pace with the realities of their digital and social media lifestyles.’

Almost half (46 per cent) of those quizzed said the phenomenon of 'sexting', where people send explicit pictures of themselves to others, was ‘part of everyday life for teenagers nowadays’

Some 72 per cent of 18-year-olds worry that the prevalence of porn leads to ‘unrealistic attitudes’ to sex, while two-thirds said porn has led to pressure on young women to act a certain way and 68 per cent said it has put pressure on girls to look at certain way.

Slightly fewer said pornography had put pressure on young men to act and look a particular way (61 per cent and 56 per cent respectively).

Seven in 10 of those surveyed said pornography encourages society to view women as sex objects.

But the survey also revealed some gender differences in attitudes towards online porn. Almost half of boys (45 per cent) said porn helped young people ‘learn about sex’, compared to just 30 per cent of girls.

Two-thirds of the 18-year-olds surveyed said porn has led to pressure on young women to act a certain way and 68 per cent said it has put pressure on girls to look at certain way

Some 40 per cent of girls strongly agree that porn ‘leads to unrealistic attitudes to sex’ compared to just 21 per cent of boys.

The survey also found that two-thirds of youngsters think that people are too casual about sex and relationships.

The vast majority of those questioned (86 per cent) said that sex and relationship advice should be taught in schools.

Some 16 per cent said their main source of information about sex and relationships was pornographic websites, with another 26 per cent identifying the internet as a major source.

Just 22 per cent identified their parents as a major source of information.

Around two-thirds want sex and relationships education to be taught by a trained expert, 40 per cent think lessons should be given by an external visitor and just a fifth say it should be taught by a teacher at the school.
