Elderly residents at a sheltered housing block have been banned from drinking alcohol in communal areas following complaints by tenants about rowdy and 'intimidating' behaviour.

Residents in their 80s and 90s were said to be so frightened by the actions of two tenants that staff called in 24-hour security to keep the peace over Christmas.

Now the guards have gone but residents can no longer drink in shared areas following a row that began in the communal room as some of the pensioners put up their Christmas tree in early December.

Alchohol is banned from communal areas at Birch Grove sheltered housing in Jarrow, South Tyneside

A spokesman for South Tyneside Homes, which runs the housing complex, said the complaints centered on two residents at the Birch Grove sheltered housing complex in Jarrow, South Tyneside.

He said: 'The consumption of alcohol is still banned in communal areas at Birch Grove.'

But he said that the security guard who was brought in last December to deter anyone at the accommodation from misbehaving had been stood down earlier this month.

One carer who helps a pensioner at the block said residents blamed a couple of 'problem tenants' whose antisocial behaviour was upsetting the peaceful majority of retirees.

An insider at the accommodation block, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is appalling to need a security guard for people in their 80s and 90s, just to protect them from other residents.

'And the cost must have been enormous. To have someone there 24 hours a day, it must be thousands of pounds.

'It was the only sheltered housing block in the borough with this measure in place.'

The 33-flat block caters for over-60s in independent flats, with a communal sitting room and kitchen.

Another source said: 'They brought in the security guard 24 hours a day at first. Then he was scaled down to be there between 4pm and midnight in case anything happened, and now he has gone.

'But people are still fearful.Â  No one wants to use the communal areas because they are scared they will be subjected to abuse and intimidation.

'There are no group activities. With these dark winter nights, everyone is in by 5pm, but then it's lockdown. Everyone just goes to their own rooms all night.

'Some people are in their 80s and 90s and are not strong enough to stand up for themselves.

'And there were no New Year's Eve parties for Birch Grove because booze has been banned in communal areas.

'Residents couldn't have a drink to celebrate the festive season.

'People in other sheltered blocks were up until 1am celebrating, but at Birch Grove they were all in bed by 9.30pm.'

A number of Birch Grove residents complained to South Tyneside Homes, which manages the block.

John Musson, director of housing for South Tyneside Homes, said: 'We do not tolerate antisocial behaviour in any form and always encourage our tenants to report any cases of abusive, threatening or intimidating behaviour to us so that we can take appropriate action.

'We are investigating allegations of antisocial behaviour at Birch Grove Housing Plus Scheme in Jarrow following a number of complaints from tenants.

'We are working closely with tenants and their families and have agreed to put a number of temporary measures in place to provide reassurance while we resolve this matter.'
