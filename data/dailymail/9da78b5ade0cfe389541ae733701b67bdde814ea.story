Bracelet bounced back from her disappointing display in last month's Qipco 1000 Guineas to give Aidan and Joseph O'Brien victory in the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot.

Having made a winning reappearance at Leopardstown at the end of March, the daughter of Montjeu failed to fire in the Rowley Mile Classic and was a 10-1 shot stepped up to a mile and a half and fitted with a hood for the first time.

Buried in the middle of the pack while her stablemate Terrific played the role of pacemaker, Bracelet edged closer to the front end still moving sweetly rounding the home bend.

She had to be pulled wide to challenge once straightened up, but got rolling from the two-furlong marker and saw out the trip well to hold off the late challenge of Lustrous by half a length.

Criteria was just a head away in second, with French-trained favourite Vazira making up a lot of ground from the back of the field to take fourth.
