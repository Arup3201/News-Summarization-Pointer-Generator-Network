David Letterman announced on Thursday that he will be retiring in 2015 after 33 years of being a late night host. The Simpsons were among the first to honor his career.

Letterman's popular show is the longest-running scripted show and he has the longest track record of any talk show host in the history of late night television, reports Mashable.

The Simpsons, longest-running American 
sitcom and animated program, fittingly paid tribute to the late night 
fixture with a humorous couch gag.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The video tribute starts with The 
Simpsons sitting together in a taxi in New York City traffic on their 
way to Letterman's coveted stage.

They rush out onto the city streets and Homer is distracted by a street magician who tries to take his money.

Wife Marge Simpson pulls him by the arm and gets him back on the journey to Letterman's studio.

When
 The Simpsons arrive at Letterman's Late Night studio, the doorman 
denies entry and shows them a guest list which has no record of their 
names.

Homer, never one 
to let someone get in the way of what he wants,  simply grabs the 
doorman by the collar, headbutts him, and he and his family make their 
way to the next obstacle: the stage door.

First the Simpsons must get past the doorman of the building in Manhattan where Letterman's studio resides

Homer and his family get past the stage door by headbutting the woman out front as well

The family all runs onto the couch and Letterman says, ' 'That's It? We flew you out here and put you up for that?'

The Simpsons even parodied the Paul Shaffer orchestra whose animated version played The Simpson's theme song

The Simspons clip ended on a tear jerking note when the screen simply flashed, 'we'll miss you, Dave'

Upon arriving at the stage door and 
meeting a woman working for the show, Homer headbutts her as well and 
they make their way down to the stage.

The animated Letterman says, 'So what are we doing here? Is it the thing where the family runs in and sits down?'

The Simpsons sit on his couch and Dave says, 'That's It? We flew you out here and put you up for that?'

He
 then motions to the famous Paul Shaffer orchestra who play the Simpsons
 theme song. The screen flashes with a heartwarming goodbye title, 
'We'll miss you, Dave.

Letterman's
 own on-air retirement was similarly touching. In his final moments, he 
recounted the 22 years he spent working for CBS hosting the 'Late Show 
with David Letterman' and the 11 years he hosted NBC's Late Night. He also guest hosted on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the late 70s.

Letterman said goodbye on his show on Thursday and held back tears of his own

Letterman joked that now that the show is over, he and Paul Shaffer can finally be married

The Huffington Post reports 
that before Thursday night's program, he called CBS president Leslie 
Moonves and said, ‘Leslie, it’s been great, you’ve been great, and the 
network has been great, but I’m retiring.'

'Moonves,
 he and I have had a relationship for years and years and years, and we 
have had this conversation in the past, and we agreed that we would work
 together on this circumstance and the timing of this circumstance, ' 
said Letterman.

Letterman also joked that now that the show is over he and Paul Shaffer can get married.

'What
 this means now, is that Paul and I can be married ... we don’t have the
 timetable for this precisely down – I think it will be at least a year 
or so, but sometime in the not too distant future, 2015 for the love of 
God, in fact, Paul and I will be wrapping things up,' quipped the host 
as he said his goodbyes.

Letterman said that as hackneyed as it seems, he wants to retire so that he can spend more time with his family.

He recalls that when he told this to his son, the boy replied, 'What part of the family?'

'There is only one David Letterman,' Moonves said of the retiring host.

'His
 greatness will always be remembered here, and he will certainly sit 
among the pantheon of this business.'
