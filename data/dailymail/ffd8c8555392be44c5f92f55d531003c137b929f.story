Josie Gibson was recently pictured showing off her bikini body while on a holiday in Morocco.

The 29-year-old is proud of the fact she has lost 6st since she won reality TV show Big Brother in 2010 and has reinvented herself as a fitness guru.

Now she's beaten her own battle with the bulge, she's on a mission to help others get in shape.

Reformed: Josie has lost 6st since taking up exercise and changing her eating habits

Josie told MailOnline the first step on any weightloss journey is realisation - accepting you are not leading a healthy lifestyle and becoming aware of the impact that can have on your day-to-day activities and self-esteem.

She explains: 'There were lots of times I wanted to lose weight in the past - I call
 them "wake up calls". I think at the start of everyone's weightloss 
journey it's important to write your wake up calls down and keep them in sight.

'My wake up calls were lots of things but mainly the abuse I was getting on Twitter from people I didn't even know; the time I couldn't do up a pair of knee high boots in plus-size shop Evans and the time I couldn't do a flying lesson my friends had bought me for my birthday due to my size.'

The Bristol-born star said these wake up calls should then become your motivation to change your ways by exercising more and eating less fattening foods.

For those that need a kick start to get in shape, she's running a number of GI Jane Bootcamps (or more apt GI Josie) sessions in Kent this April.

Participants can book in for a few days midweek, at the weekend or for a full week where they will undertake fitness classes and learn about nutrition.

'The Bootcamp is suitable for women of 
all shapes, ages and sizes who want to have fun, burn fat and educate 
themselves on health and fitness. You will leave ready to take on the 
world,' she said.

Josie, a qualified personal trainer, will lead the sessions which will include military circuits, BoxFit and dance classes.

She describes the boot camp as a "fitness holiday" where she will pass on the knowledge she has gleaned on how to burn fat through exercise and eating well - without yo-yo dieting.

She said: 'I had tried everything to lose weight.
 All I ever wanted to do was beat my genetics. I've found a way of doing
 that now and I want to show others the way.Â 

'Changing habits and getting fit is no easy road for a person starting
 their weight-loss journey. The key to everything is educating yourself,
 setting realistic goal and loving the person you are.'

She added: 'Forget fad diets!
Nine out of 10 people on a fad diet will always end up putting weight on 
again. The healthiest way to loose weight is to eat natural and clean 
foods. The environment we live in almost wants us to be sick and fat. We
 need to make a change together so the food industry changes with us.

Josie said she will give talks on nutrition during the boot camp revealing how her knowledge of food has changed, helping her drop from 16st 7lb at her heaviest to a svelte size 8 now, weighing 10st 2lb.

'I will advise on how I shop for food, eating habits and all the little tips I've learnt along the way to keep fit and healthy,' she said.

'Some people think its all about the amount of calories you eat vs the amount of exercise you do, but it's so much more than that. Some of my friends eat the same things I once did, but will never put the weight on. It boils down to your genetics, what you eat, your environment, how you shop for food, how you feel about yourself, your addictions and all sorts of factors.'

Josie's mission to get the nation active doesn't end with her boot camp. She's also joining forces with ballet dancer Darcey Bussell for a day of mass participation exercise classes.

Called the BIG BURN, the stars will each take centre stage to lead sessions for 1,500 people at a time.

The fitness routines choreographed by Darcey and Josie have been specially designed to suit all levels of fitness ability.

Strictly judge Darcey's session is a full body aerobic workout programme based on dance steps from ballet to the jive and Charleston.

Meanwhile, Josie will lead a series of intense work-outs from her fitness DVD, '21 Day Fat Burn', which was released in January.

The unique fitness event will be held at Alexandra Palace in North London on Saturday, 31st May.
