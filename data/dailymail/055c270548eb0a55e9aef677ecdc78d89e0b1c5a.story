A Chinese official was removed from his post after he was pictured accepting a piggy back ride from a resident of a typhoon hit city through flood water - because he didn't want to ruin his shoes.

A picture of the official, known only as Wang, sparked outrage when it was posted on Chinese social media website Sina Weibo.

The photo was taken as Wang visited the city of Yuyao, in Zhejiang province, as the area suffered widespread flooding after being hit by a devastating typhoon which left 10 people dead.

Natural disaster: Yuyao City, in Zhejiang province, China, was hit by heavy flooding following a typhoon. An official was reportedly pictured being carried across flood water because he didn't want to ruin his shoes

According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, a caption posted alongside the photograph claimed that Wang was being carried because he was wearing a pair of expensive shoes made of cloth.

But the Sanqishi Township government, which employed the official, claimed that he had been set to remove his shoes to walk barefoot to a flooding victim's house.

But according to MSN reports, despite Wang's insistence that he would walk, the local picked him up anyway and carried him through the water.

Wang was given a second piggy back by the man as the group left the house.

Whether the official had intended to walk as suggested by reports or not, the online fuss created by the picture saw him removed from his post as director of the township's construction office.

Hundreds of thousands of people had to be evacuated from their homes after Typhoon Fitow hit southeastern China last week.

The typhoon cut power in many parts of the region and high speed rail services were suspended as winds hit 125mph.

According to reports, parts of the area, including Yuyao, saw up to 11 inches of rainfall in just 17 hours and were hit by extensive flooding.

Around seven million people in the province were affected in total.

According to the South Morning China Post, fighting broke out in the city last week after residents were angered by state television news reports that the flooding had subsided and people had 'gone back to their normal lives'.
