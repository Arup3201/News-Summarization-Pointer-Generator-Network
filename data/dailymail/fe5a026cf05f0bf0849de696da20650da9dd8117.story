Lawsuit: Chris Sevier, 36, pictured, filed a 50-page complaint in federal court last month blaming Apple for letting his access porn

A married Nashville lawyer and amateur model is suing Apple claiming the tech giant should have blocked him from accessing porn when he, apparently by accident, typed 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google.

Chris Sevier, 36, filed a 50-page complaint in federal court last month claiming the supposedly innocent spelling mistake resulted in him viewing a plethora of pornographic images that 'appealed to his biological sensibilities as a male and lead to an unwanted addiction,' which then 'poisoned his life' and ruined his marriage.

Sevier, an army veteran who on a Model Mayhem profile lists his age as 26, states in the suit that Apple should sell all products with an installed porn-filter. He is seeking damages from the company.

'The Plaintiff is a victim of Apple's product that was sold to him without any warning of the damage the pornography causes,' the suit reads.

'In using safari, the Plaintiff accidentally misspelled "facebook.com" which lead him to "f***book.com" and a host of web sites that caused him to see pornographic images that appealed to his biological sensibilities as a male and lead to an unwanted addiction with adverse consequences.'

He added: 'But for the Plaintiff's use of the Apple product, the quality of the Plaintiff's life would have been much better and injury would have been avoided.'

Servier goes on in the complaint to 
allege 'unfair competition' between the porn stars and his wife, brought
 about by his use of the Apple product, and thus 'interference of the 
marital contract.'

'The Plaintiff became totally out of synch (sic) in his romantic relationship with his wife, which was a consequence of his use of his Apple product,' the complaint reads, according to Abovethelaw.com.

'The Plaintiff began desiring, younger more beautiful girls featured in porn videos than his wife, who was no longer 21.'

He said his subsequent failed marriage caused him emotional distress to the point of hospitalization.

Apple has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Later in the suit, Sevier goes on to point out that a preset porn-filtering software wouldn't just have saved him from his 'unwanted desires' it would help 'mom and pop' bricks and mortar porn shops because it would be harder for websites to survive.

'Unregulated internet porn is hurting brick and mortar or 'mom and pop' porn shops,' he writes.

'This is no different than how illegal downloading of musical content and movie content has caused the collapse of traditional record stores and video rental entities, such as block buster (sic).'

The complaint was filed the same month Servier was charged with aggravated stalking for incessantly emailing country music star John Rich.

According to The Tennessean, one of the emails included a picture of a scantily clad Sevier draped in an American flag and covered in a substance 'believed to be representing blood.'
