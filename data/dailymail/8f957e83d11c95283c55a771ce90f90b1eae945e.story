Tony Romo will travel to London and will prepare as if he will play against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The quarterback sat out the Dallas Cowboys’ lacklustre 28-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals after suffering two minor fractures in his back during last week’s defeat to Washington.

‘We’re betting on him playing. If we didn’t think he could play, he wouldn’t be on that long flight,’ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.

Back-up Brandon Weeden was error-strewn in Arlington, and failed to find a receiver in the first half. He ended the day completing 18-of-33 passes for 183 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.

And Jones was less than complimentary about his side’s meagre offense, telling NFL Network: ‘Very limited today. I’m surprised it was that limited.’

Romo did not practice all week but the decision not to play him was taken just 90 minutes before the game.

‘He progressed each and every day, never to the point where he could practice. So obviously without getting any work up to this point, it was a fairly easy decision once we got to gameday,’ said head coach Jason Garrett.

DeMarco Murray’s 100-yard streak was ended in the defeat, with the running back finishing with 79 yards from 19 carries.

Murray is leading rusher this season with 1,133 yards and became the first player to rush for 100 yards in eight straight games.

The defeat saw the Cowboys move to 6-3, relinquishing the lead in the NFC East to the Philadelphia Eagles following their second straight defeat.

The Cowboys arrive in England on Tuesday, a day after the Jacksonville Jaguars, who play the second of their four-game Wembley deal on Sunday.

Despite a late rally in Cincinnati, the Jaguars moved to 1-8 following a 33-23 defeat to the Bengals. The decision-making of rookie quarterback Blake Bortles continues to infuriate, but he nevertheless showed signs of promise, particularly in the second half. And undrafted rookie Allen Hurns had an impressive outing with seven catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns.
