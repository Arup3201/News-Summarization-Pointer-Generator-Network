A six-year-old who has endured more than 30 operations has been given a new lease of life, saved by her grandmother who donated a kidney.

Ella Chadwick was born with the rare congenital nephrotic syndrome, and had both of her kidneys removed when she was 19 months old.

The youngster has had 38 operations and was facing having dialysis treatment for the rest of her life.

When a kidney transplant from her father Martin failed in October 2010, Ella's parents gave up hope.

Ella Chadwick was born with the rare condition congenital nephrotic syndrome, which caused her to suffer kidney failure at 19 months. Both her kidneys were removed and she was put on dialysis until her father Martin donated one of his kidneys

When the organ donated by Mr Chadwick failed, Ella's parents gave up hope. But her grandmother Christine Chadwick (pictured with Ella) stepped forward offering to donate one of her kidneys to help the six-year-old

But Ella's grandmother, Christine Chadwick, stepped in and offered to be a donor.

The 58-year-old was found to be a match for her young granddaughter and the operation took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

Ella's mother Karen Hughes, 33, from Manchester, said: 'It's been an incredibly difficult time for us as a family but it's such a relief to see her up and about.

'We didn't know if she would be strong enough for the operation right up until they cut her open.

'Ella was on dialysis at home until she was strong enough, but after the first transplant failed we barely dared hope this time round.

'Christina was so brave volunteering to give her a kidney - as soon as they said it she was happy to get tested there and then.

'I didn't dare dream we would ever get to this point, never mind how well she has done. Ella is definitely one amazing little girl.'

The concerned parents first took Ella to the doctors with her condition when she was just three weeks old, when they noticed she had a red 'outie' belly button.

But they were told unless it got worse or became painful it was nothing to worry about.

Miss Hughes said: 'We had another check up when she was six weeks old and she had lost some weight.

Ella, who is from Manchester, was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where she has had her transplant operation

The youngster, who had been on dialysis treatment, is recovering well in the hospital, and her parents Karen Hughes and Martin Chadwick hope she will be allowed home soon

Since she was 19 months old, Ella, pictured with her parents, has had 38 different operations

The kidneys of people with nephrotic syndrome do not work properly, causing large amounts of protein to leak into their urine.

It can affect people of any age, but it is often first detected in children aged between two and five years old.

The loss of protein can cause a range of problems, including swelling of body tissues and increase a person's chance of catching infections.

Symptoms can be controlled by medication.Children with the condition have times where their condition is under control, when they are in remission.

ion can flare up, when symptoms return in times of relapse.

A small number of children have congenital nephrotic syndrome, which means it is inherited.

These children tend not to do as well.They may, as in Ella's case, experience kidney failure and need a transplant.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome is caused by an inherited faulty gene. For the condition to be passed on, both parents must have a healthy copy of the gene and a faulty one. They then have a one in four chance that any children will develop the condition.

Nephrotic syndrome can affect people of any age, but it is commonly seen in young children.It affects more boys than girls.

Only about one in every 50,000 children are diagnosed with the condition each year.

'After that we were in and out of hospital trying to find out what was wrong with her.

'In my head I never thought it would be anything serious - if she was poorly she would not be eating or sleeping, but she was behaving like a perfectly normal baby girl.'

Eventually a blood test diagnosed Ella with congenital nephritic syndrome.

The condition means the proteins and fats that are meant to be absorbed and excreted in the urine are not.

The result is that fluids in the blood stream leak into the body's tissues, flooding the kidneys.

Miss Hughes said: 'As a parent after hearing those words it consumes your life day and night.

'You can never unhear them no matter how much you try and push them to the back of your head.

'It would keep me awake at night and then when I finally got to sleep I would wake up with a sudden urge to check on her.'

Ella is currently recovering at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and it is hoped she will be out in six weeks.

Miss Hughes, added: 'It's been a rollercoaster for us.

'We don't want her to go home until she is better but it's so hard being away from our family and friends.

'Her illness has led to complications - she now can't walk unaided and needs a wheelchair.

'Ella has been on life support five times - it's amazing how much work the kidneys actually do and the knock on affect on her whole body.

'We are so proud of Ella - we have the bravest, strongest little girl.'
