The dead lie stacked up on trays, while the survivors fight for their lives in hospital.

These are the young victims of a suicide bomber triggered an explosion while football fans were watching the World Cup in Nigeria.

At least 14 people were killed in the blast which went off in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, soon after the Brazil vs Mexico game on Tuesday night.

The explosion at an illegal World Cup viewing site in Damaturu northeast Nigeria killed at least 14 people

Witnesses said a tricycle taxi was driven into the outdoor area before the bomb went off.

Police
 said the death toll was 14, with 26 people wounded. One hospital worker
 told the BBC however that he had counted 21 bodies.

There was 
no immediate claim of responsibility but Boko Haram, an armed Islamic 
group that wants to turn Nigeria into an Islamic state, was suspected.

Security
 experts have warned that Islamic militants might attack crowds watching
 the World Cup in public places in Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, as they 
did in 2010 in Uganda.

The explosions in Kampala, Uganda, at two sites 
where people watched the 2010 World Cup final on TV killed 74 people. 
Al-Shabab, a Somali insurgent group, set off those bombs.

Nigeria's
 military has promised increased security but appears incapable of 
halting a stream of attacks by extremists holding more than 250 
schoolgirls hostage.

Police
 assistant superintendent Nathan Cheghan said rescue workers were being 
careful for fear of secondary explosions, often timed to kill people who
 rush to the scene of a bomb blast.

The
 kidnapping of the girls two months ago and failure of Nigeria's 
military and government to rescue them has roused international concern.

The United States is searching for the girls with drones and has sent experts along with Britain and France to help in counter-terrorism tactics and hostage negotiation.

Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau has threatened to sell the girls into slavery unless the government agrees to exchange them for detained extremists, but President Goodluck Jonathan has said he will not exchange prisoners.

Nigeria's military has said it knows where the girls are but that any military campaign could get them killed.

Boko Haram wants to enforce an Islamic state in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, with a population almost equally divided between Christians and Muslims.
