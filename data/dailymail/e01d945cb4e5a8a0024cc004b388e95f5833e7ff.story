Rev. David Dickinson has quit as vicar of The Holy Trinity Parish Church in Hoghton, Lancashire, after parishioners disliked his evangelical style

A vicar has quit after elderly parishioners mounted a whispering campaign against him for introducing ’happy clappy’ hymns into his church services.

The Rev David Dickinson had boosted congregations at his church in the picturesque Lancashire village, attracting dozens of young families and their children.

But his efforts to modernise the church services caused a wave of resentment among older worshippers.

And when he got them all to clap along to ‘He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands’ and ‘Shine Jesus Shine‘ many older parishioners felt it was beyond the pale.

The final straw for the vicar, known to worshippers as Dave, came when most of the choir boycotted a recent wedding and members of the congregation had to step in to save the day.

Last night parishioners said the popular vicar had been forced to quit after ruffling the feathers of more traditional churchgoers.

A member of the Parochial Church Council said: ‘It’s absolutely disgusting what has happened here. We have lost a fantastic vicar because of a minority of wicked people.

‘It is pure evil. How they can call themselves Christian is beyond me. They are simply hypocrites and they are the ones who should leave, not the vicar.’ 

One church council member, who asked not to be named, said: ‘99 per cent of us would have him back in a second. We all love him so much. David is a wonderful man and a wonderful vicar.

‘There are lots of families who only go there because of him. To have 50 or 60 children going to services on Sunday is fantastic. He is the best vicar I have ever come across and he just has this way of communicating with youngsters.

‘It’s a sorry state of affairs when a man like this can be driven out by a very small number of traditionalists.’

Church leaders, including the local bishop, have spoken of their disappointment at his resignation.

And the church choir has been temporarily disbanded as Bishop John Goddard pledged to resolve ‘issues’ within Holy Trinity Church in the village of Hoghton, Lancashire before appointing a successor.

Rev Dickinson had been vicar at Holy Trinity for eight years after retiring as a religious studies teacher at St Wilfred’s high school in Blackburn.

The historic church, which was built in 1823, contains a Grade II listed organ. The village is home to less than 900 people.

Villagers said Rev Dickinson, 55, who is married to Gillian, was ‘very popular’ but a minority of parishioners had objected to his evangelist style.

One church-goer said youngsters were encouraged to help pick hymns and would clap along to modern favourites.

She said: ‘Two Sundays of the month were family services but there were traditional communions and services too - he catered to everyone.

‘The family services were done in such a way to make it easier for the children to understand, but it still followed the church of Evangelism.

‘At every service Rev Dickinson always preached to everyone about giving their life to Christ. He thought that was part of his Evangelical mission. And if you hadn’t already let him into your life, to do so.

‘He always did that - some people liked it, some people didn’t. The choir would sing at every service so it was a shock when they walked out at the wedding.’

Parishioners say the tension between Rev Dickinson and up to a dozen long-term churchgoers - some of them members of the Holy Trinity choir - had been brewing for more than two years.

Another churchgoer said: ‘His style was very evangelical - it might be that that didn’t sit well with people.

‘He would preach like that one week but the next be very high church. He was trying to keep everyone happy.’

Another said: ‘I think it is such a shame. He did a beautiful service for my daughter who died in her sleep a few years back. He supported me and my family.’

Rev Dickinson refused to comment about reasons for his resignation saying: ‘It’d be totally inappropriate for me to discuss this.’

A spokesman for the Acting Bishop of Blackburn, the Right Rev John Goddard, said: ‘We have every intention of appointing a new vicar to the parish, but will delay the matter until issues leading to the resignation have been resolved.

‘The Bishop is keen to stress that he regards Rev Dickinson as a fine priest.’
