Britain will see a 10C drop in temperatures as the nation is plunged back into freezing conditions.

Up to 5in of snow is predicted in higher areas as the mercury hits -4C tomorrow in parts of Scotland, forecasters have warned.

The dip will start in the far north and spread down across the country until it reaches the far south, which has seen double-digit temperatures in recent days and was covered in a thick layer of fog this morning.

The Met Office has put out several yellow warnings, including one for rainfall in East Anglia and snow across central England and Yorkshire.

The entire country will be affected by the chill, thanks to frosty winds sweeping in from the east from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia.

The north-easterly will bring snowfall to parts of Country Durham 
today and tomorrow, while Newcastle will be hit by flurries of snow 
tomorrow and into Monday morning.

Met
Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: 'There will be a brisk easterly 
wind and it will really feel bitterly cold, especially in the south 
where there will be a massive drop in temperatures so it will feel very 
icy.

'For example in the south tomorrow, with a maximum temperature of 4C and a wind speed of 20 knots, it will feel like -1C.

'It will increasingly fall as sleet and snow overnight, but it will be patchy with some areas seeing snow and some seeing none.'

Forecasters are predicting more snow to fall over the next few days prompting the Met Office to issue warnings

Three day forecast

The weather warnings come after a 
brief respite of 'spring-like' weather this week, as parts of the 
country enjoyed temperatures of 17.5C – hotter than Ibiza.

But tonight the cold front will bring a band of rain, sleet and snow will 
then sweep south, with strong, freezing winds making the temperatures 
feel even colder than they are. The icy weather will continue on Monday,
when snow is predicted across Britain.

The
mercury nudged 13C in the West yesterday, but by the evening the cold 
snap had already began to descend – with temperatures dropping to 2C in 
Scotland.

Look out: It seems winter isn't over yet as the entire country is set to be met with a big chill

Wind speeds are going to increase over 
the weekend, going up to 30mph in Devon. And forecasters say the 
freezing temperatures, which are below average for March, show no sign 
of shifting in the near future.

Andy Smith, from the AA, urged motorists to take care in the wintry conditions. He said: ‘After a pretty good couple of weeks, there could be a sting in the tail for drivers who may have thought the bad winter weather was all over.

‘March is actually often one of the most extreme and varied months for weather and a cold easterly wind this weekend will plunge the country back into winter.'
