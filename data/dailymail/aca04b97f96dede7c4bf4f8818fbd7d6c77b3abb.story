A Tennessee man was robbed after a woman stripped naked and swam in his pool to distract him while her accomplice made off with jewelry and a handgun from his home.

The 54-year-old victim was at his Crossville subdivision home on Saturday afternoon when a couple who were his neighbors approached him.

The woman suddenly ordered her husband to go back and fetch her cigarettes before she began chatting to the victim about his pool.

After a few moments, she asked if she could take a swim, according to Crossville Police Officer Camden Davis.

The man agreed, and led her to his backyard where the pool was located.

She then asked if it would bother him if she took a dip without her swimming costume. He said that it wouldn't be a problem.

She proceeded to remove her clothes and jump into the swimming pool.

She swam for about 20 minutes, with the home owner sitting poolside the whole time.

The home owner then went inside to retrieve a towel for his visitor and she dried herself and said goodbye.

When the woman left, the man went back inside and noticed a handgun, jewelry and medication missing.

The value of the goods was placed at $1,195, according to the police report.

The two suspects have been identified by police but police are searching for them for questioning.
