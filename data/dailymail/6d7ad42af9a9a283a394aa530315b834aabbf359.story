Falkland Islanders started voting  yesterday in a sovereignty referendum seeking to counter Argentina’s claim over the British-ruled territory.

Diplomatic tension between Britain and Argentina has flared more than three decades after the Falklands War.

Falklands-born and long-term residents will cast ballots on whether they want to stay a British Overseas Territory.

A high turnout is expected from among
the islands’ population of roughly 2,500, and officials are due to 
announce the result tonight.

An overwhelming 'yes’ vote is likely, prompting Argentina to dismiss the referendum as a publicity stunt.

But John Fowler, deputy editor of the
islands’ weekly newspaper, the Penguin News, said: 'We hope the 
undecideds, or the uninformeds, or those countries that might otherwise 
be prepared to give the nod to Argentina’s sovereignty claim, might have
pause for thought after the referendum.

'This is an attempt to say 'hang on a minute, there’s another side to the story'.'

The local Falkland Islands Government has mobilised a major effort to get as many of its 1,650 registered voters as possible to cast their secret ballots today and tomorrow

People queued to vote at the town 
hall in the capital Stanley, nearly 8,000 miles from London, where 
posters proclaim: 'Our Islands, Our Choice’.

'I have no wish to be part of Argentina,’ said Rob McGill, 67, of isolated Carcass Island, who voted by post.

'I consider myself a Falkland Islander, but my ancestors came from Britain,' he said.

The post office produced a line of official stamps to mark the occasion.

In distant islands and far-flung sheep farms, ballot papers were being flown and driven in by mobile polling stations.

Some islanders are the descendants of British settlers who arrived eight
or nine generations ago and the Falklands retain an unmistakably 
British character despite a sizeable community of immigrants from Chile and Saint Helena.

Residents say fiery remarks by Argentine President Cristina Fernandez 
and her foreign minister, Hector Timerman, have galvanised patriotic 
sentiment on the islands, which lie nearly 8,000 miles from London and just a 75-minute flight away from southern Argentina.

Tensions have risen with the discovery of commercially viable oil 
resources in the Falklands basin and by Fernandez’s persistent demands 
for Britain to hold sovereignty talks over the Malvinas, as the islands are called in Argentina.

The Government says it will only agree to negotiations if the islanders want them, which they show no sign of doing.

Timerman said last month the referendum had the 'spirit of a 
public-relations campaign' and the foreign ministry accused Britain of 
pursuing 'irresponsible initiatives in bad faith'.

'This new British attempt to manipulate the Malvinas issue through a 
vote by the population that it implanted is forcefully rejected by 
Argentina' a ministry statement said.

There has been broad Latin American support for Argentina’s position.

Argentina says the sovereignty dispute can only be decided between London and Buenos Aires.

The 10-week Falklands War killed about 650 Argentines and 255 Britons and 
ended when Argentina surrendered.

It is widely remembered in Argentina as a
humiliating mistake by the brutal and discredited dictatorship ruling at the time.

No one in Argentina advocates another attempt to take the islands by 
force, but some analysts say the current tough strategy may prove 
counterproductive by antagonising islanders.
