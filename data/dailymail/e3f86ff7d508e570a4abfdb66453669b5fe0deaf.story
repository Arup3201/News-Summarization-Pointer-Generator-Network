It seems a roaring fire wasn't the only thing keeping Bronze and Iron Age Scandinavians warm through cold winter nights.

From northwest Denmark, from 1500 to 1300 BC, to the Swedish island of Gotland as late as the first century AD, Nordic people were drinking an alcoholic ‘grog’.

Chemical traces of the ingredients of the drink were found buried in tombs alongside warriors and priestesses,

Ancient Scandinavians drunk an alcoholic mixture of barley, honey, cranberries, herbs and grape wine imported from Greece and Rome.

By analysing chemicals found in ancient jars, scientists revealed that the drink was a hybrid of local ingredients.

These included honey, bog cranberry, lingonberry, bog myrtle, yarrow, juniper, birch tree resin, and cereals including wheat, grapes barley and rye.

The research proves the existence of an early, widespread, and long-lived Nordic grog tradition - one with distinctive flavours and probable medicinal purposes.

It also provides the first chemically proven evidence of importing grapes from southern or central Europe as early as 1100 BC, demonstrating both the social and cultural prestige attached to wine.

Samples of the drink were found buried in tombs alongside warriors and priestesses. Pictured here is a uoung woman, believed to be a priestess, buried in an oak trunk coffin under a mound at Egtved in Jutland, Denmark

With Dr McGovern's help, Delaware-based 
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery recreated the Nordic grog in October 2013, 
using wheat, berries, honey and herbs.

According to Dr McGovern, the grog tastes sour, like a Belgian lambic.

There are also other options available to those who want a taste of Bronze Age Europe.

The Swedish brewery Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri, for instance, created different version of grog called Arketyp.

‘About the closest thing to the grog today is produced on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea,’ Dr McGovern noted.

‘You can taste Gotlandsdryka in 
farmhouses. It’s made from barley, honey, juniper, and other herbs like 
those in the ancient version.'

‘Far from being the barbarians so vividly described by ancient Greeks and Romans, the early Scandinavians, northern inhabitants of so-called Proxima Thule, emerge with this new evidence as a people with an innovative flair for using available natural products’, said Dr Patrick McGovern, lead author of the paper.

‘They were not averse to adopting the accoutrements of southern or central Europeans, drinking their preferred beverages out of imported and often ostentatiously grand vessels,# he added.

‘They were also not averse to importing and drinking the southern beverage of preference, grape wine, though sometimes mixed with local ingredients.”

To reach their conclusions the researchers, based at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, obtained ancient residue samples from four sites in a 150-mile radius of southern Sweden and encompassing Denmark.

The oldest, dated 1500 – 1300 BC, was from Nandrup in northwestern Denmark, where a warrior prince had been buried in an oak coffin with a massively hafted bronze sword, battle-axe, and pottery jar whose interior was covered with a dark residue that was sampled.

A second Danish sample, dated to a later phase of the Nordic Bronze Age from about 1100 – 500 BC, came from a pit hoard at Kostræde, southwest of Copenhagen.

A brownish residue filling a perforation of a bronze strainer, the earliest strainer yet recovered in the region, was sampled.

A third Danish sample was a dark residue on the interior base of a large bronze bucket from inside a wooden coffin of a 30-year-old woman, dating to the Early Roman Iron Age, about 200 BC, at Juellinge on the island of Lolland, southwest of Kostræde.

The bucket was part of a standard, imported Roman wine-set, and the woman held the strainer-cup in her right hand.

A reddish-brown residue filling the holes and interior of a strainer-cup, again part of imported Roman wine-set, provided the fourth sample.  

Dating to the first century AD, the strainer-cup was excavated from a hoard, which also included a large gold torque or neck ring and a pair of bronze bells, at Havor on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea.

According to Dr McGovern, the 
importation of southern wine grew rapidly in the Bronze and Iron Ages, 
and eventually eclipsed the grog tradition - but never completely.  

Many
 of the ingredients in Nordic grog went on to be consumed in birch beer 
and as the principal bittering agents of medieval beers, before hops 
gained popularity.

'The base of Kvasir is a toasty red winter wheat, and the bog-grown berries deliver a pungent tartness,' according to the website.

'While a handful of hops is used, the earthy, bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs.'
