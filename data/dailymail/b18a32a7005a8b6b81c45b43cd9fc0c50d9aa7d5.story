An Iraq war veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder told
police he killed his friend execution-style.

Paul Vermillion, 30, of Anchorage, Alaska, admitted Dec 5 to
Alaska State Troopers that he shot Genghis Muskox, 27, dead – but he said the
killing was in self defense.

‘I executed the threat,’ Mr Vermillion said to investigators, a source told the Peninsula Clarion.

Shot dead: Genghis Muskox, 27, was killed by friend Paul Vermillion

Troopers arrived at Mr Vermillion’s vacation home in Cooper
Landing, a town about 100 miles south of Anchorage, after he called 911 to
report the killing and discovered Mr Muskox’s bullet-riddled body.

The slain man had been shot twice in the head and multiple
times in the chest, authorities told the Clarion.

When asked by cops if he killed the man, Mr Vermillion
replied ‘yes.’

They immediately arrested the Army vet and charged him with
first-degree murder.

Mr Vermillion told police he shot the man while defending
himself after the two men got into a fight and Mr Muskox choked him, his family told the Clarion.

‘He might have shot off his mouth, and he might have gotten
himself into trouble,’ Susan Muskat, Mr Muskox’s mother, told the Alaska Dispatch, but
she vehemently denied her soon was violent.

Free spirit: Mr Muskox moved around a lot and held many different jobs

The month since the killing has seen a groundswell of
support for Mr Muskox, but people have also been quick to point out the
eccentric Minnesota native had a tendency to drink and talk too much.

Both men were charged with drunk driving last year, records showed.

Prior to living in Alaska, Mr Muskox had been living on a
houseboat in San Francisco. He had run afoul of local authorities there after
he was found tossing his dog Coffee Bean into the harbor, a friend told the Dispatch.

He was charged with animal cruelty but would later claim
Coffee Bean loved the water, but was forced by officials to get the dog fixed
before they would return her to him.

Mr Muskox left for Alaska soon after that and found jobs as
a tree climber and a handyman, which is how he met Mr Vermillion. The
contractor he worked for was hired by Mr Vermillion’s family.

The two men quickly became close pals, friends told the Dispatch,
but there were signs of trouble in their kinship.

Tommy Dixon, who grew up in Minnesota with Mr Muskox and
visited him in Alaska, called the killing 'an execution' and told the Dispatch of a troubling story he was told by
the now-deceased man.

A tendency to find trouble: Multiple people said Mr Muskox perhaps tended to drink and talk too much

Devastated: Girlfriend Jenna Miller posted a series of heartbreaking messages on Facebook after Mr Muskox's death.

‘Genghis said once before the guy 'switched,' Mr Dixon
recalled. ‘He said Paul pointed a rifle at him and said, 'What are you doing
here?’

‘I think the guy (Vermillion) was f****d up from being in
war,’ Mr Dixon concluded.

Several people told the Dispatch that Mr Muskox was trying
to help Mr Vermillion cope with being disabled after surviving two Improvised
Explosive Device attacks.

‘That was what he was, and that's what he did,’ Shawne
Baccari said. ‘I'm just heartbroken… He was amazing.’

Multiple people told the Dispatch that both men had a tendency
to drink too much, but they were both good people.

‘Neither one of them seemed angry,’ a mutual friend told the
Dispatch. ‘They were both very polite. Genghis was definitely a character. Paul
was a bit of a character himself. I never saw any animosity.’

Jenna Miller, the girlfriend who moved from California to be with Mr Muskox in Alaska, quit her job and has been left without the man she dropped everything for.

'Baby how will I live if I can't gaze into those eyeballs anymore????' THe heartbroken woman posted to a picture on his Facebook page. 'My heart was in there. I love you.'

Mr Vermillion pleaded not guilty to an array of counts
including first degree murder. He is due back in court Feb 10.
