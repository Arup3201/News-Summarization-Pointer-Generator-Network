Americans living in the eastern U.S. have certainly been feeling the cold this past week, but now they can see it.

This weekend, NASA released a satellite photo which shows the Midwest and East Coast turned white with snow and ice thanks to a recent blast of Siberian and Arctic air. 

However, the blast has contributed to 21 weather-related fatalities in Tennessee since Monday, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. They include 11 people who died of hypothermia and five victims of motor-vehicle accidents.

'Looks like the states have been sitting in a freezer,' the space agency said in a statement. 

The picture was taken by NASA's Terra satellite 200 miles up from Earth on Friday when record low temperatures were set across the nation including in Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina and Georgia.

Any hopes of a big thaw should be retired for the time being. Another 'Siberian Express' weather system is forecast to hit Sunday, causing a rain-and-snow storm to hit parts of the East Coast and South.

Six inches or more of fresh snow was forecast for parts of
the Northeast by early Sunday, according to the National Weather
Service (NWS). Bitter cold is also expected, but conditions
should start to ease in many areas by mid-morning, the service
said.

Following nearly a week of cold and ice in Tennessee, Governor Bill Haslam elevated the state on Saturday to a higher level  of emergency, which means hard-hit areas may be eligible for state and federal assistance.

The state, which has more than 44,000 power outages, is expected to get around a half-inch of snow Sunday night, with some freezing rain and sleet in parts of West Tennessee.

Boston, which had already been hit by 98.7 inches of snow going into the weekend, saw only about an inch Saturday,
but local weather watchers there were forecasting the total
tally to hit 100 inches by midnight. The city's total is well
above the average yearly total of 31 inches

The new round of harsh weather is part of a system that has
cut a curving, 2,000-mile path from southern Missouri to Maine.

Snow and ice contributed to major delays at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York Saturday, with some arriving
flights delayed more than two hours, and flights destined for
Newark International Airport in New Jersey were delayed more
than three hours, according to a Federal Aviation Administration
advisory.

Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings were in
effect until Sunday for parts of West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
New York, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire, the NWS said.

The system dropped steady snow on Washington and Baltimore
as it pushed up the East Coast Saturday. West Virginia saw 18
inches of snow, according to state officials.

NWS warned that 'structural collapses' are possible for
rooftops overloaded with the persistent snowfall. Maryland State
Police said people had abandoned their vehicles along
interstates and roadways. 

In Kentucky, 10 people have died since Monday in
weather-related incidents, said Buddy Rogers, a spokesman for
Kentucky Emergency Management.

Pennsylvania authorities said Friday at least two people had
frozen to death outside.

A 119-year-old record low temperature for February 20 was broken
in Washington, with a temperature of 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus
15 degrees Celsius) recorded at Ronald Reagan Washington
National Airport.

On Monday morning, there is a possibility of heavy snow to fall over areas of the central Rockies, and  rain is expected in parts of southern California to  the southern High Plains, according to NWS.

A front extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf Coast is predicted to move into the Southwest towards the southern tip of Florida, and also over the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico by Tuesday.

The southern Plains to parts of the Mississippi Valley will have freezing rain and sleet during the day and throughout the evening on Monday.

Rain will also develop from the southern Plains to the Southeast through Tuesday, while light snow is expected to fall over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley in the evening.

Temperatures are set to be between 25 and 40 degrees below average for parts of the central and southern Plains, and 20 to 35 degrees below average from parts of the Lower and Mississippi Valley to the Ohio valley and Lower Great Lakes.
