No doubt this duck was getting excited about its big moment as Taiwan prepares to see in the New Year.

But then it all went horribly wrong... leaving the 50ft-tall yellow rubber superstar somewhat deflated.

The massive inflatable - designed by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman to be a giant version of the popular bath toy - burst today while it was on show at the port of Keelung in the north of the country.

Crowds had already started to gather by the port of Keelung in the north of Taiwan today when tragedy struck...

One theory is that the giant duck, designed by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, was attacked by eagles

Nooooooooo! The end is nigh for the rubber duck

It had been on display there for 11 days, only to explode at around noon -Â  hours before large crowds were expected to gather to welcome 2014.

The cause of the deflation, which was caught on film, is a mystery.

However, one theory is that it was attacked by eagles.

Huang Jing-tai, one of the organiser's for tonight's festivities, said: 'We want to apologise to the fans of the yellow rubber duck. The weather is fine today and we haven't found the cause of the problem.

'We will carefully examine the duck to determine the cause.'

Clearly cursed, this is the third time bad fortune has befallen the giant inflatable in Taiwan.

In November, a similar duck deflated when its air pump malfunctioned following a power outage during an earthquake.

And in September, yet another duck was taken ashore as a typhoon approached.

As well as Taiwan, the duck has visited 
various other famous waters around the world, including the cities of 
Sydney, Osaka and Auckland.

The duck is deflated for transportation and then re-inflated on location using a generator.

The artist claims the duck reconnects people with their childhood.

Mr Hofman said he wanted to bring joy with his giant duck, which he claimed helped reconnect people with their forgotten childhoods.

'My sculptures cause an uproar, astonishment and put a smile on your face,' he said.

'They give people a break from their daily routines. Passers-by stop in front of them and enter into conversation with other spectators. People are making contact with each other again.'

In a statement on his website, he said: 'The Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn't discriminate people and doesn't have a political connotation.

'The friendly, floating rubber duck has healing properties: it can relieve tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!'

The artist's other works include Fat Monkey - a giant monkey made from 10,000 brightly coloured flip-flops - and a giant cuddly toy rabbit called Big Yellow Rabbit.

On the first leg of its tour of Taiwan, the giant duck appeared at the Glory Pier in the port of Kaohsiung (above)
