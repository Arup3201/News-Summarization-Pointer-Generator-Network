Louis van Gaal has dismissed recent praise of his team by claiming Manchester United are still nowhere near good enough.

The Dutchman's side laboured to a 2-0 victory against League One Yeovil Town in the FA Cup on Sunday afternoon and, despite a decent run in the Premier League, Van Gaal insisted there is significant room for improvement.

The former Barcelona and Ajax coach also revealed that the patience shown by United's supporters during their slow start to the season had caused him to feel guilty.

'The first feeling I had was especially after 11 matches, when we had 13 points, and I came into the stadium walking and I thought now the fans shall not be pleased,' he told MUTV. 'But they were rising up and clapping their hands when I entered the stadium.

'I felt not so happy myself because I was responsible and guilty for the results so I am very happy we won a number of matches in a row [afterwards]. 

'I have had the time to know all my players and they are very good. It's an exciting time and it's why I became a manager - because I want to work with young people; it keeps you young, and you can make a team out of it.

'We are still building up a process. I think, as a trainer/coach and manager, that I have to analyse the performances of my players because that is the most important thing and that shows how far we are in the process. 

'That is still not good enough, in my opinion, but I hope we shall improve.' 

Van Gaal also admitted that he had been surprised with the patience of the supporters early in the season
