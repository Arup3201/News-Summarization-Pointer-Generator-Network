Video footage of a glowing squid-like creature swimming in a harbour, might have baffled experts, but the mysterious animal has now been declared a hoax.

Stunned eyewitnesses had filmed the strange, luminescent, tentacled creature, which was flashing a variety of colours floating close to the top of the water in Bristol.

But it has now been revealed that the paranormal animal was part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote a new TV programme.

Creature from the deep? It has now been revealed that the 'alien squid' was part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote a new TV programme

Sightings of the creature by the public puzzled marine biologists.

Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said: ‘It's very intriguing - I don't really know what to make of it.’

The guerrilla campaign was created to launch a new show called ‘The Happenings’ on Watch, which features the magicians ‘Barry and Stewart’ and is made by the producers of Derren Brown.

The TV show is described as a ‘new type of narrative magic show’ that brings film scenes to life, which are unleashed upon unsuspecting residents from towns across the UK and the U.S.

It launches on Monday December 9 at 9pm on Watch.

The videos, which include ‘paranormal’ events and what is described as a ‘giant bioluminescent alien’ have racked up over one million views since they appeared on YouTube four months ago.

The squid looked more mysterious at a distance but the new images allow people to see how the 15ft model was constructed

Bristolians took to social media to report the 15ft, squid-like alien pulsing beneath the water in the city's harbour.

Videos and images shot by stunned locals of the tentacled alien first appeared on Tuesday and within 24 hours over 3.5 million related tweets were written.

Before the hoax was revealed, one Twitter user questioned whether the squid had escaped from Bristol Zoo.

This bizarre sight greeted people walking along Bristol harbourside - described by some as an 'alien-like creature' floating underwater

Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it.

Some people suggested that Bristol artist Banksy might have had something to do with the strange object.

Marine biologists admitted they were baffled by the footage and suggested it could have been a marine salp which had drifted off 
course by the weather.

Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said before the unveiling: 'This is either a very interesting animal or someone's very cool interpretation of a marine creature.'

Marine biologists claimed the footage could be a marine salp which had drifted off course by the weather.

Dr Simpson said: 'There is a possibility that it is a special type of jellyfish or a marine salp. It's very unusual and I haven't really seen anything like it before though.

'What makes it even more unusual is that fact that it showed up in the middle of a really busy area.

'There are various marine animals that have biological illuminating abilities and they are able to make themselves flash.

'It
 is entirely possible that it is a marine creature which has been 
brought into the harbour because of the storms or maybe it was trying to
 shelter from the stormy seas.

Alex Gordon-Lennox, 22, who was one of the many people to witness the strange creature, said: 'It was just floating down the harbour. I've never seen anything like it before.

'I only noticed it because it was flashing and was so bright. I was out with some friends that night so we watched it travel down the water a bit and then it just seemed to disappear.

'It looked a bit like a jellyfish or a squid or something. It was amazing.'
