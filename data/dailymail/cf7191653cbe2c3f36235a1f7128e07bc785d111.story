Chris Froome’s chances of winning next year’s Tour de France have been enhanced by some key new signings at Team Sky.

Sir Dave Brailsford has responded to a difficult 2014 Tour for his team by recruiting highly-rated Czech rider Leo Konig from NE on a two-year, seven figure deal.

Nicolas Roche, son of former Tour champion Stephen, has also moved to Sky but the recruitment of 26-year-old Konig is the most significant.

Seventh in this year’s Tour and considered both an outstanding climber as well as an excellent TT rider, Konig even has the potential to one day lead the team.

But he will join initially as Froome’s chief lieutenant alongside Richie Porte in a bid by Brailsford to secure a third Tour title for Sky.

Team Principal Sir Dave Brailsford said: ‘We’ve signed five quality riders for next season and each one of them will help strengthen and enhance the squad.

‘We’ve always set our standards high and been very ambitious with our goals. We want to win the biggest races and constantly improve as a team and these new riders have the proven experience and developing talent to perform now and in the future.

‘We have a strong nucleus of riders at Team Sky and these signings will be excellent additions to the squad. They all bring their own qualities and we’re looking forward to welcoming them to the team and seeing them in action next season.'
