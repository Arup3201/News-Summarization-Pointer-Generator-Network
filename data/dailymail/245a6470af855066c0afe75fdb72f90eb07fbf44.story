At 24 and a half, Pip is way too advanced in years to be learning any new tricks.

But as probably the oldest dog in the world – and most certainly in her home county of Essex – she already has plenty of tricks under her belt – or rather her collar.

The terrier-whippet cross is believed to have become the most senior canine after the death of a 26-year-old pet in Japan earlier this month.

And Pip has lived a life that most young pups could only dream of. Jumping through hoops of fire, sniffing out weapons and even meeting Royalty, she has packed a lot into her 170 dog years.

She is still a key member of a display team for whom she has performed 1,000 times, and was singled out for praise by the Queen after the Royal Tournament at Earls Court in 1997. Pip took the mantle of the world’s oldest dog after the death of a Shiba mix in Japan called Pusuke.

But she still has a while to go before she can lay claim to being the oldest recorded dog in history – a title held by Bluey, an Australian cattle dog who was 29 when he died in 1939.

Pip’s owner Tiffany Dyer, 36, of Brentwood, Essex, said: ‘It is wonderful to know that she is the oldest dog in the world but the main thing for me is her quality of life.

‘She has the right amount of exercise and a very good diet but she is a little old lady now so she needs her time to relax and does have problems with her eye-sight and hearing.’

Miss Dyer’s father Roy, 68, said: ‘After the team performed for the Queen, Her Majesty said “Mr Dyer, that was absolutely brilliant”.’

As well as her weapon-hunting and fire-jumping activities with the Essex Dog Display Team, Pip has been helping children overcome their fear of dogs.

She is unlikely to get in the official records because Miss Dyer does not have a birth certificate for her, having taken her on at one when she needed re-homing.

Old ladies:  For the past 20 years Pip, left, has been helping children with a fear of dogs. Pusuke, right, the world's oldest living dog according to Guinness World Records, died on Monday, December 5 aged 26
