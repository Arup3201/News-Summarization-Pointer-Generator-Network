Feeding the horses is a wholesome activity but might need an adults-only warning in future after a pensioner came across two X-rated carrots in one bag.

Pam Wilson, 65, discovered the rude vegetables that look like a naked man and woman in a bag of vegetables.

Ms Wilson said she was left in fits of giggles after digging out 'Mr Carrot' from the bag last week.

Saucy: The suggestive carrots were discovered by Pam Wilson as she fed her friend's horses

Mr and Mrs Carrot: One looks like a man's lower half while the other resembles a woman with her legs crossed

The carrot appendage resembles a man's lower half complete with his 'meat and two veg'.

Ms Wilson then reached into the bag and found 'Mrs Carrot'.

The retired home tutor said she laughed even more when she picked up the vegetable that looks like woman with her legs crossed.

Ms Wilson, from Louth, Lincolnshire, said: 'I thought it was quite humorous when I pulled out the male-looking carrot.

'But I couldn't believe my eyes when I picked a Mrs Carrot to go with him.'

Ms Wilson amused herself by taking pictures of the carrot couple. Some even included Mr Carrot giving a rose to his beloved.

Humorous: Pam Wilson arrange the carrot couple in a range of positions before feeding them to the horses

But, sadly for the vegetables, their shape did not spare them their fate for very long.

She said: 'I took some pictures of them arranging them into different positions and then I fed them to the horses.

'I didn't see the point in keeping them they weren't my carrots - they were for the horses.

'And they seemed to quite enjoy them. Everybody I have shown since thinks they are hilarious.

'It's a little bit naughty - but you've got to have a giggle haven't you.'
