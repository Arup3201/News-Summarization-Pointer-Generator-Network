Prince Charles showed his soft side today as he enjoyed a tender moment with a local school girl.

The youngster was clearly pleased to see the royal and leaned in for a kiss on his cheek after he and the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, visited La Macarena Church in Colombia. 

A group of young schoolchildren had waited patiently for the Royal's arrival and cheered gleefully as he greeted them.

Pucker up! The Prince of Wales is kissed by a local school girl after he and the President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos visited La Macarena Church, La Macarena in Colombia, on the third day of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall's tour to Colombia and Mexico

It's been a busy day for the Prince of Wales, who is currently on a royal visit in Colombia. 

Earlier in the day, Charles jokingly waved his arms in the air as if saving himself from falling in when he visited one of the world's most stunning natural phenomena - a river that runs red.

He flew by helicopter in to former guerrilla-held territory to see Cano Cristales - known as the liquid rainbow - a river that appears to change colour.

The Prince experienced the impressive sight caused by algae on the riverbed changing hue at different times of the year, from green and yellow to blue and black and famously red.

Earlier Charles spoke movingly about the loss of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten, when he visited Bogota's Centre for Peace, Memory and Reconciliation which commemorates those killed and displaced during five decades of violence in the fight against guerillas and drug cartels.

In a speech about how he had 'experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence' and stress: 'Many of you will probably not know that my own much-loved great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and members of his family ... were murdered in Northern Ireland, just over 30 years ago.

'So I feel I do understand something of the bewildering and soul-destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure.'

Out and about: The Prince of Wales and the President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos have a walking tour of Cano Cristales

The crystal clear waters of Cano Cristales are likely to become a major tourist attraction now the area - once in the hands of Farc (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) guerrillas - is firmly in the hands of the government.

Julia Miranda, director of Colombia's national park, hosted Charles' visit to the national wonder and said after the royal had left: 'It was marvellous. The red colour of the waters was very intense.

'He was really happy to be here and he asked many questions and seemed really interested in the geography of the area.'

Charles was also joined during his visit by Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon who has been instrumental in helping to preserve Colombia's Amazon region.

He joked of Charles' entourage that the picturesque spot was known as the FARC country club where a guerrilla general would bring his partner and they would swim in the waters.

The President and the Prince walked along the rocky riverbank and looked down at the miniature waterfall and also the swirling whirlpool that have been cut out of the rocks by the water.

Earlier the Prince had flown to the huge Chiribiquete National Park that encompasses the Amazon rainforest where it crosses into Colombia.
