Tottenham striker Harry Kane hailed a 'dream come true' after marking his England debut with a goal within two minutes of action at Wembley.

Kane replaced captain Wayne Rooney in the 71st minute and headed home with  his third touch to cap off a comprehensive 4-0 win for England over Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier.

The 21-year-old claimed his debut goal was the best moment of his career so far as Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling added to the scoring.

'Not too bad is it. It’s the start that I dreamed of and to see it come true is amazing,' Kane told ITV. It’s all a bit of a blur at the moment but I’m delighted, I’m delighted for the lads and most importantly we got the three points.’

Asked whether it's the best moment of his career so far: ‘Yeh by far, obviously to represent your country at senior level is the top and hopefully I can continue to do it and hopefully it’s the first of many.

The red hot Spurs striker would relish the chance to start against Italy in a friendly on Tuesday: 'Yeh of course but that’s up to the boss, If I’m called upon then that would be great,' added Kane. 'We’ll see what happens, recover over the next couple of days and look forward to it.’

Manager Roy Hodgson was evidently pleased with Kane's instant impact at Wembley.

‘He’s had a wonderful season so far and crowned his England debut with a goal, a great goal as it was a marvellous piece of skill from Raheem (Sterling), with good movement from Kane to the back post and a very determined header. So it couldn’t be better for us at the moment, a very satisfying evening for us.’

England captain Wayne Rooney was full of praise for his fellow striker: 'It's fantastic. International football is different , so to score after just 80 seconds is incredible, we’re all delighted for Harry and hopefully it’s the first of many.

Rooney had several chances to add to his impressive England goal tally and hit the woodwork twice in the first-half: 'I was a bit disappointed with the first one which hit the post. I felt I got a shove which knowcked me off balance but the second one I had to go to the far corner and unfortunately it hit the post,' said the England skipper. 

'I’m happy, I scored, we won, it’s a big three points in this qualifying campaign.

‘Since the World Cup we’ve been fantastic with some great victories,' added Rooney. 'We’re scoring lots of goals, we’re a really energetic team, so I think a lot of team around Europe will look at the team and will be frightened.'
