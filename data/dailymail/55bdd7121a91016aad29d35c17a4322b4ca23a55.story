Tragic: Audrey Wakefield was 82 when she fell backwards off a chair weeks after a stroke and broke her back - but it went undiagnosed by medics at Mid Staffordshire hospital

Doctors at scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire Hospital failed to notice an 82-year-old grandmother had broken her back - and discharged her before she died.

Audrey Wakefield was admitted after falling backwards off a chair onto a beside table in her nursing home on February 20 last year.

The grandmother-of-two was left with severe head injuries, bleeding on the brain, and a broken back.

But she was merely given stitches before being discharged and returned to Manor House nursing home in Stone, Staffordshire.

Two days later, Mrs Wakefield became erratic and was rushed to nearby University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS).

There, doctors discovered she was bleeding into her brain and had broken her vertebrae.

She was immediately sent to Douglas McMillan Hospice in Stoke-on-Trent where she died on April 11.

Today, South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh heard that doctors could not explain why the broken back was not spotted.

Dr Indira Natarajan, a consultant physician at UHNS, told the inquest: 'On February 24, she was admitted with confusion and spent time on another ward before being referred to the stroke ward.

'A scan showed that she had damage to the spine and a bleed into her brain. She also had thrombosis in her bladder.

'I cannot say why another unit did not carry out the scan, it is hard to say, I think I would have carried out the scan, but I cannot know the circumstances.

'After some time it was decided that our care was doing more harm than good and she was very distressed. After consulting with the family we moved her to palliative care.'

The inquest heard that Mrs Wakefield had suffered as stroke in January and was cared for at UHNS before being sent home with difficulty speaking.

Mrs Wakefield was sent back to her nursing home with a broken back by staff at the scandal-hit hospital

Mrs Wakefield's daughter Anne Dicks told the court the stroke team had never visited her mother.

She said: 'I know that no one visited her. The home had no central heating, she was sent to the care home because she was an ice block and there were snow drifts outside.

'I was the next of kin and no one asked me before she was discharged the first time. My father was suffering from shock.'

Lesley Powell, who is manager of Manor House home, said: 'She suffered the fall apparently when she attempted to get out of the chair she was in unaided and toppled backwards onto a unit.

A consultant physician at UHNS told the inquest she could not see why another unit did not carry out scans

'Staff called an ambulance at 16.35 and she was taken to hospital at 21.05. She wasn't seen as an emergency.'

Dr Terence Hollingworth, a pathologist who carried out Mrs Wakefield's post mortem told the coroner that she had died of bronchial pneumonia and a closed head injury.

He said: 'The broken back was significant in that it showed that she had fallen backwards and that was how the head injury came about.'

The inquest was adjourned to continue at a later date.
