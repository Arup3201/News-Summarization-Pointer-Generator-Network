An Alabama jury has found a woman guilty of capital murder after she made her  9-year-old granddaughter run for three hours as punishment - causing her to collapse and die.

Joyce Hardin Garrard faces the death penalty or life without parole for the February 2012 death of Savannah Hardin, after the verdict was delivered on Friday. 

Garrard showed no reaction when the verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies. She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently.

Joyce Hardin Garrard is led back to the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Alabama, after being found guilty of capital murder. She made granddaughter Savannah Hardin, 9, run for three hours as punishment in 2012

The youngster collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood. She died three days later in hospital 

Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry. 

Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about 3½ hours of deliberation. Garrard's husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing.

Garrard is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday. Jurors will hear additional testimony and make a decision on whether to recommend life without parole or death. The final decision is up to the judge.

Authorities claimed the 49-year-old woman forced Savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy. Savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital.

The defense denied the woman meant the girl any harm, but jurors rejected that claim.

Garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse. Garrard testified that the girl did run, but only as practice for races at school.

Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.

Garrard walks to the Etowah County Judicial Building on Friday to prepare for a hearing. She now faces the death penalty or life without parole 

Assistant District Attorney Carol Griffith said Garrard killed the child intentionally by berating her and making her run around the yard picking up sticks

'She was tortured,' Griffith said.

Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department.

Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said.

But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day.

The 49-year-old walks in handcuffs around her feet, waist and arms, accompanied by two officers  

He said, 'I think we have all had the thought: "If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'' He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support.

'Then it becomes "Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell",' he said.

Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon.

Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence.

Savannah's stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin has also been charged with her murder, which carries a life sentence.

The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth while in custody in February 2012.
