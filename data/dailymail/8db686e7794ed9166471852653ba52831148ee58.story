Celebrity Big Brother exile Ken Morley acted like a 'professional pervert' who deliberately fluffed lines during the filming of a double glazing advert so he could 'slap' a model's bottom, it was claimed today.

Sarah Whitefoot said working with the 'creepy' former Coronation Street star, 71, was torture because he 'couldn't take his eyes off my cleavage'.

The actor was thrown off Celebrity Big Brother this week for using 'unacceptable language' including the repeated use of the word 'negro' and saying two female housemates had 'the best a**** he's ever seen'.

Model Ms Whitefoot, who is married with a son, claims he treated her like a sexual object and 'within minutes of meeting me he (Morley) was putting his arm round me and slapping my bum'.

Fresh claims: Model Sarah Whitefoot says that Ken Morley had slapped her bottom during the filming of a double glazing advert

Facing the public: Morley told presenters and viewers of Loose Women yesterday he was not sexist or racist

Sarah Whitefoot claims filming with Ken Morley was terrible because he was ogling and touching her

She also says the filming of the short Safestyle UK double glazing advert in 2002 needed an extraordinary 20 takes, which she believes was deliberate so he could spend more time touching her.

She told The Sun's Ruth Warrander: 'He was a professional pervert — as though as this was the way he normally acted, as if it was acceptable. I was clearly just an object to him. It was quite sinister really.

'He was putting his hands round my waist, cuddling me and patting my bum'.

Ms Whitefoot says she put up with his behaviour because 'he was famous' and she was 'trying to get my acting career off the ground'.

Despite earning almost £1,000 from the advert she said she asked never to work with Morley again. She said she was pleased he was thrown off the Channel 5 show because: 'I am just so glad he has been exposed for who he really is'.

Yesterday the actor faced the public for the first time since his controversial comments, but insisted he was not racist or sexist. 

The 71-year-old actor repeatedly clashed with his housemates and was evicted from the show for using 'unacceptable language' including  use of the word 'negro' in a conversation about former Boxer Frank Bruno.

Prior to leaving the house, Morley, who had already received a final warning after he branded US singer Alexander O'Neal a 'nice big fat negro'.

He was called to the diary room immediately and told to leave after describing a row he had with boxer  Bruno, where he again used the racist term.

In a discussion with Keith Chegwin, he recalled the conversation he had with Bruno, where he told the boxing legend: 'Hello, Lord Fauntleroy here - turn down your negro rhythms.'

Early exit: The actor arrives home  after being thrown off CBB for his 'offensive' language

Morley, who appeared in pantomime in Bradford with the former boxer in 1996, recalled the conversation he had with Bruno, where he told the sportsman: 'Hello, Lord Fauntleroy here - turn down your negro rhythms'

Morley, who played  Reg Holdsworth in Coronation Street for a decade, told presenters and viewers of ITV's Loose Women that he apologised 'unreservedly' for his behaviour, and maintained he was not racist, but had used an 'outdated expression'

He also refused to apologise for his comments deemed by many of his female housemates to be sexist, instead complaining of their 'provocative' clothing, and incidents he said were cut from the show.  

Rather than saying sorry for causing offence by referring to house mate Cami Li as a 'slut' or for saying both Li and Page Three girl Chloe Goodman, 21, have some of 'the best a**** he's ever seen', he instead claimed producers had edited out bad behaviour from some of the other contestants.

Pressed again on whether his comments had been sexist he replied that some of the women housemates from America had been wearing 'provocative' clothes.

'In the context of the show, the ladies from America, they work in various aspects of the entertainment industry. One does a transsexual act and part of that is to dress in provocative clothes.

'When they arrived here they insisted on wearing the most daring clothes they could get away with.'

Former Coronation Street star Ken Morley was called to the diary house immediately after describing a row he had with Frank Bruno, where he used a racist term, and was told to leave

Singer Jamelia then put to Morley that his comments had made the female housemates feel uncomfortable, saying: 'You didn't care about offending people'.

He was told his comments had offended hundreds of viewers, but replied 'I don't know the people who have been upset'.

MailOnline has approached Mr Morley's agent for comment.
