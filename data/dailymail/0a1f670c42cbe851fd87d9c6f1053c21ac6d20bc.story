She may not have been born a Duchess. But baby Camilla still came into the world by royal approval.

Yesterday her husband, Prince Charles, revealed a hitherto unknown royal fact: that he and his future wife were delivered by the same gynaecologist-obstetrician - but in very different surroundings.

The prince made his revelation on a visit to King's Hospital in Camberwell, south London, where, by coincidence, the Duchess of Cornwall was born to Major Bruce Shand and his wife the Hon Rosalind Shand on July 17 1947.

The man believed to be responsible for her safe delivery was the Queen obstetrician, Sir William Gilliat, who also worked at King's.

A year later - on November 14 1948 - Charles was delivered by the same eminent medical man but in the more rarefied surroundings of Buckingham Palace.

'My darling wife was born here but amazingly we had the same gynaecologist and nurse,' the prince told fascinated staff.

The couple visited several parts of the hospital including its neo-natal unit where Camilla cheered worried parents and their babies as she cooed and pulled funny faces.

She was particularly taken with five-month-old Jessie, who laughed and gurgled at the royal face-pulling.

One mother said: 'Camilla was fantastic. She had Jessie in fits of giggles and was so good with him, pulling funny faces to make him laugh'

Mum Amy Benardout, 19, said: 'Camilla was fantastic. She had Jessie in fits of giggles and was so good with him, pulling funny faces to make him laugh.

'She's a gran herself so she's obviously good with babies.

'Jessie was born with a bowel defect (gastroschisis) last August and we've been here in the unit ever since.

'He's got to have another operation soon to lengthen his bowel, and he'll be here for a year, but the future looks bright.'

Before he left Prince Charles told hospital staff: 'The work you do here is fantastic, particularly having seen the neonatal unit and elderly wing- ever more significant with our advancing age!'

Afterwards the Duchess was able to see first-hand wash bags now handed to victims of rape and sexual assault that she helped to devise.

Camilla came up with the idea after meeting victims and discussing what would make them feel 'more human' after going through such a traumatic ordeal and subsequent forensic examinations.

With the help of her private office and supporters she drummed up enough donations from companies including Marks & Spencer, Champneys, 2 True and Trevor Sorbie to make up 750 of the bags which are currently being handed to women – and men – seeking help from The Haven rape crisis centres in London.

The programme will be trailed on a two-year trial basis, although there are hopes to expand the initiative.

Speaking about her idea the Duchess said: ‘When you are ill, the first thing that you want to do is wash your hair and clean your teeth. The same applies here.

‘It is a small something to make women and girls who go through such a terrible ordeal feel just a little bit human again.

‘We are starting in a small way but I hope that we will be able  to expand the scheme. It won’t change what has happened but might offer a small crumb of comfort at what is a very difficult time.’

The Duchess was shown round The Haven centre at King’s Hospital, which is one of three centres in London that help around 140 victims – including men and children – each month.

Most are brought in by police but a proportion refer themselves, often after years of abuse or sexual violence.

The Duchess met several members of staff including a nurse, counsellors and a senior forensic practitioner who deal with the centre’s clients.

‘It must be quite a daunting experience,’ said the Duchess as she discussed the courage victims often had to find to report their experiences.

‘Do a lot of people decided they don’t want to take it [reporting their assault] further?

‘I think you all do a wonderful job, thank goodness for people like you.’

After
 being shown the wash bags which contained  shampoo, conditioner, 
handcream, a flannel, bodywash,  toothpaste and a toothbrush and 
mascara, she said: ‘You can’t even change what happened but you can make
 the journey better.’

Jo 
Delaforce, Matron of the Havens, said: ‘I can’t tell you what this 
initiative means both to us and our clients. It makes them feel worthy 
again. When you experience something like they have you have no 
self-esteem, no self-worth and experience a lot of self-doubt. Many 
experience self-blame too.

‘To be given something like this, to enable you to wash and feel clean again and then take home, makes you feel valued.

‘A
 few years ago when I went round for donations to some of the big 
companies they either didn’t want to know or would only give us 
something if their name was branded on the side. The Duchess has made 
this happen.’

With the help
 of her private office and supporters she drummed up enough donations 
from companies including Marks & Spencer, Champneys, 2 True and 
Trevor Sorbie to make up 750 of the bags which are currently being 
handed to women - and men - seeking help from The Haven rape crisis 
centres in London.

The programme will be trailed on a two-year trial basis, although there are hopes to expand the initiative.
