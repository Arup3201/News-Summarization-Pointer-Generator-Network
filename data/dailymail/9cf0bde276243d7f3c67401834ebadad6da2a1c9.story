Ian Holloway launched an assault on elements of his own supporters last night after a large number of Millwall fans mocked the travelling Leeds contingent over the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Holloway was left appalled by crass and disgusting chants relating to the sex crimes committed by the late entertainer in Leeds and, unprompted, demanded an end to vile chanting at matches.

He said: ‘I didn’t like the banter to be honest. I don’t think it was respectful, I really don’t.

Disrespect: Holloway criticised the Millwall supporters who mocked Leeds fans about Jimmy Savile

‘I don’t think [Savile chants] are right. I don’t care where he is from — that [Savile’s actions] is an absolute disgrace. Let’s stop and think about what he has actually done. That’s the most important thing and we don’t see that. “Oh, it is a bit of banter”. It isn’t funny, is it? I don’t think so.

‘Nobody likes a laugh more than me but I’m respectful — and that’s what I’m trying to show to Leeds United.

‘Until we make a stand the world ain’t right. How often do we turn a blind eye to things? I want to look after our people. Some of the stewards aren’t as big as me. Why can’t people in the stand say, “Chuck this guy out?” Coming into a ground doesn’t give you the right to say those things.’

Millwall have worked hard in recent years to tidy their unruly image, with Holloway highlighting the fact that they were rated as having the most improved family experience last season.

He added: ‘I am bursting with pride about my club, but I will ask my fans if they think that is right. It is disrespectful.’

The fans’ behaviour took the shine of an impressive Millwall win that exposed the weaknesses of Leeds’s playing staff at a time when their off-field antics are drawing scrutiny. For Dave Hockaday, this defeat — inflicted by goals from Mark Beevers and Shaun Williams — was bad. 

The only consolation was that the second half was not as bad as the first and, perhaps, the man known as the manager eater will have no appetite for head coaches.

Hockaday was quick to make the distinction in terminology as he attempted to explain a performance that will not have escaped Massimo Cellino’s attention. How could it when the Italian goes where the team goes. He was in the dugout before the game, and briefly on the touchline ahead of kick-off to talk to the groundsman.

He was also in the dressing room and exchanged a handshake with his head coach. But there were no words, even if there was, presumably, a lot to say after a showing as weak as this.

Hockaday said: ‘I will talk to the owner tomorrow. I saw him before the game, I shook his hand afterwards. He was talking to the Millwall groundsman about I don’t know what — he wants to learn about English football.’

He won’t have liked much of what he learned here. Beevers was left unmarked for the opener, Noel Hunt blew a great chance to equalise early in the second half and Williams secured the points for Millwall with a late penalty.

‘First half we didn’t perform, didn’t stick to the game plan,’ Hockaday said. ‘Second half we got their attention and made a fist of it. We responded well. But football is about moments.’

At this moment, Leeds have a lot to work on.
