A lawyer for the man
accused of shooting two police officers during a protest rally outside
the Ferguson, Missouri, police headquarters last week said on
Monday that his client was beaten when he was taken into custody, an
allegation police called 'completely false.'

Jeffrey L. Williams, 20, had bruising across his back, on
both shoulders and his neck, and a welt on his head and a mark
on his face, attorney Jerryl Christmas said, adding that he met
with him for two hours on Monday but could not take pictures. 

'He was beat up by the police,' said Christmas. 'He was beaten when he was taken into custody.'

Attorney Jerryl Christmas told reporters on Monday that he met with Williams for two hours but police wouldn't allow him to take pictures

In a mugshot of Williams released on Sunday his face and neck appeared to have several cuts and bruises, although Christmas didn't make clear if those were the injuries he was referencing. 

Williams had appeared briefly in court on Monday morning
without counsel and did not enter a plea. He is charged with two
counts of first-degree assault, a class A felony that calls for
10-30 years, or up to life in prison.

The shooting was the latest violent incident in months of
demonstrations in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, after a white
police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown
during a confrontation in August.

In announcing Williams's arrest on Sunday, St. Louis County
Prosecutor Robert McCulloch told reporters Williams had admitted
firing the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday and
told authorities he was not shooting at police.

'With regard to the allegations that Jeffrey Williams was
'beaten' by police, the St. Louis County Police Department calls
these allegations completely false,' spokesman Brian Schellman
said in a statement. 

Schellman said Williams was taken immediately to St. Louis County Police headquarters after his arrest, interviewed by detectives on video and audio, booked and evaluated by a nurse as every inmate is, to determine if he is fit to be confined.

Christmas said Williams was taken into custody on a
probation warrant and did not know he was being arrested until
he was taken for questioning.

No one responded Monday at the Williams address listed in
court records, a one-story blue house that had trash strewn on
the lawn. Neighbors declined to comment.

Police had called the shooting an 'ambush' of the officers,
who were standing side by side, by a gunman embedded with
protesters, but McCulloch said on Sunday that Williams may have
been shooting at someone else.

Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize
or know Williams as a protester.

'Clearly this was not a police ambush and police were never
the target,' Christmas said, adding: 'It could have easily been
the protesters who got shot instead of the police.'

The shooting of the officers followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the U.S. JusticeDepartment released a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing.

The Justice Department, which launched an investigation
after Brown's shooting, found pervasive racial bias in
Ferguson's policing and municipal court practices. Its police
force is mostly white while two-thirds of residents are black.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, its city manager and
its municipal court judge have resigned.

Williams, who had been on probation for possession of stolen
property, is accused of firing shots from a car just as a rally
after Jackson's resignation was breaking up.

Demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after Brown's
shooting in August and again in November when a grand jury
declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson.

Police drew criticism for mass arrests and use of gas
canisters, rubber bullets and armored vehicles in the days after
Brown's shooting, a response officials said was needed to quell
the unrest.

A U.S. District judge on Monday allowed a federal civil
rights lawsuit filed by people arrested in August to continue. 

The lawsuit names Ferguson, St. Louis County, the chiefs of both
departments and other officers as defendants.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said he believed the 20-year-old suspect attended last week's protest before the shooting happened. Activists said Williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight-knit group.

'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' McCulloch said of Williams' contention that he did not fire at the officers.

Williams is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action. He made a brief court appearance Monday, and the case was scheduled for a later date. Court officials said he did not yet have an attorney.

McCulloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with Williams and that the investigation is ongoing.

Williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene, McCulloch said. He also said tips from the public led to the arrest.

Williams is being held on $300,000 bond.

Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters, who also had not heard of him.

Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement.

'This is a fear tactic,' she said. 'We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.'

John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, 'I don't know him. I've never seen him.'
