Bruce Holland, 64, had eaten a few mouthfuls of a chilli pie when he passed out at the Queensland pub

An Australian man has died while taking part in a pie-eating contest after declaring: 'Jeez, this chilli pie is hot', it was reported today.

Bruce Holland, 64, collapsed while taking part in the food contest at a pub in Queensland and died in hospital 90 minutes later.

Friends who were with him at the Bushland Beach Tavern, near Townsville, said they believed he suffered a heart attack after eating just a few mouthfuls of a pie.

The pie-eating contest was held during the half time break in a rugby match which Mr Holland and his friends were watching on the tavern's TV.

Arthur McMahon, a spokesman for the tavern, said it was the first time the pub had hosted a food competition and Mr Holland was the first to put his hand up to take part.

'He was always up for raffles or anything and used to like winning things,' Mr McMahon told Brisbane's Courier Mail newspaper.

'At half time they had this chilli pie competition and people were asked to volunteer and Bruce put up his hand.'

After just a few mouthfuls of pie, however, Mr Holland started to gasp and sat down with a glass of water before he passed out.

'There were seven other people in the competition and the meat was not overly hot,' said Mr McMahon.

But friend Michelle Bradley said Mr Holland's last words were: 'Jeez, this chilli pie is hot!'

Two
nurses were said to have administered CPR to Mr Holland while they 
waited for an ambulance to arrive, but he was declared dead at 
Townsville Hospital.

An autopsy will be held to establish the cause of death.

Mr Holland's death has shocked the close-knit community of Bushland Beach.

'I'll always know him as a happy-go-lucky man,' said Mr McMahon.

'He never had a bad word to say about anyone and was very well liked amongst the community.'Â
