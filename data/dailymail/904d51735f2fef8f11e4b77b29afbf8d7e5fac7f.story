The young husband of a self-confessed Satanic serial killer has said in a jailhouse interview that he's still enamored by his teenage bride despite her claim to have murdered more than 22 people.

Elytte Barbour told CNN from Columbia County Prison in Pennsylvania that the news hasn't changed the way he feels about Miranda Barbour, 19.

'I still love her,' Barbour said over a secure telephone line from the jail where he's awaiting trial for allegedly luring a man through Craigslist, strangling and stabbing him 20 times with his love, three weeks after they were married.

Speaking to CNN Wednesday, 22-year-old Barbour acknowledged, 'Everyone wants to know about her credibility but wouldn't comment on whether her confessions were valid. However, he said she was upfront with him in 'about 50/50' of the alleged slayings, with respect to specific names of victims and the locations of the murders.

He insisted he'd been cooperating with police so far, adding 'It seems like I have my life or death on the line right now.'

The interview comes after his father-in-law Sonny Dean said he would support his daughter's execution if she is found guilty and even hold the hand of the victim's widow as she'd killed.

Dean said he believes his teenage daughter may have been involved in one other murder besides the 
November 11 fatal stabbing of Troy LaFerrara, 42, in Sunbury.

But he denied that she has killed 22 people - as she claims - and branded her a 'manipulator.'

Police said LaFerrara met Barbour through her Craigslist ad, which offered companionship in exchange for money. Barbour, like the fictitious serial killer Dexter, said she only killed 'bad people.'

'Killer': Miranda Barbour (with a police officer in December) has been involved in more than one murder, her father has claimed. She is also accused of stabbing a man to death after meeting him on Craigslist

Investigators allege Barbour stabbed 
LaFerrara about 20 times in her parked car as her husband, Elytte 
Barbour, held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck from the back seat 
and then dumped his body in an alley.

The
 self-confessed teenage serial killer has claimed to have been involved 
in a satanic cult and that she had a favorite knife which she added 
notches to every time she slayed another victim.

Dean told The Daily Item that his daughter was a heroin addict and is a liar and manipulator, but he doesn't think she is a mass murderer.

'Miranda lives in a fantasy world,' he said.

Barbour
 told The Daily Item last Friday that she had killed fewer than 100 
people but stopped counting at 22. She said she lured a man into an 
alley in Alaska and watched as the leader of a satanic cult to which she
 belonged shot the man before telling Barbour it was her turn.

'Believe very little of what Miranda says,' said Dean, of Texas. 'She has a long history of extreme manipulation and dishonesty.

Victim: Barbour's father said he would hold the hand of his victim's widow, Colleen LaFerrara, while watching his daughter get executed. Colleen is pictured with husband Troy on their wedding day in 2011

Investigation: Miranda Barbour is pictured right in her mug shot and left with her baby son. The father of the child died when her boy was one and authorities are now looking to see if his death was suspicious

'She is good at manipulating people. She is the most manipulative person I have ever known.'

It is possible she participated in a killing in Alaska, he said. He also did not dispute her claim of being a satanist.

'The reason I think that the Alaska incident is a possibility is that Miranda ran away from home at least two times that I remember, both for over a 48-hour period,' he said.

'Once was around the age of 13 and once was sometime the following year, when she was 14. I don't know what took place during either of those 48-hour periods.'

Dean also said she had been in and out of treatment centers after she became hooked on heroin, and that she was so persuasive she was able to talk her way out of the centers.

'We couldn't stop it from happening and she was out.' he said.

He
 said once Miranda became hooked on drugs they refused to let her out of
 the house unsupervised - meaning she could not have carried out the 
many murders she has claimed.

'Once
 all this stuff with drugs started happening we locked our house down,’ 
he said. ‘She wouldn’t have had the chance to do any of these things she
 said.’

His ex-wife Elizabeth Dean also denied her daughter could have been a serial killer.

Dean said he prays for peace and comfort each morning for LaFerrara's 
family, especially the victim's widow, Colleen LaFerrara.

In
 a prepared statement to the family, he said if a jury decides his 
daughter should be executed, 'I would stand side by side with you, take 
your hand, and silently pray that some good may come of this.'

According to a police affidavit, Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing LaFerrara until she and her husband were presented with evidence.

'The defendant stated that they committed the murder because they just wanted to murder someone together,' police said of Elyette Barbour.
