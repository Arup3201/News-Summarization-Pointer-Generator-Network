It sells quality furniture, operates on a plush split level and even has its own coffee shop like many out of town superstores.

But this store is actually a charity shop, which opened its doors yesterday in Stockton-on-Tees with the promise that it is unlike all other charity shops in the area.

Daisy Chain sells a range of goods, including furniture, clothes and books while raising cash for the charity of the same name, which supports children with autism and their families.

The idea to open the shop came from the chair of the charity's trustees, Albert Dicken, one time managing director of the Dickens Home Improvement chain

Opening the shop was the idea of the charity's chair of trustees, Albert Dicken, the one-time managing director of the Dickens Home Improvement chain.

Charity chief executive Judith Haysmore said: 'We are going for the experience.

'We have a coffee shop and it doesn’t smell like a charity shop and it doesn’t feel like one.

'Our tag line is shop, donate, volunteer. We are hoping that people will come along and donate something, buy something, have a coffee and a think about volunteering to help local families.

Proceeds raised from the shop will go towards the Daisy Chain charity, which supports children with autism and their families

'The charity needed a sustainable income so we can still be there for the parents supporting them - I also think it will raise a lot of awareness about autism.' 

The store sells a wide range of secondhand goods as well as some new items.

Shoppers are able to purchase sofas, dining room furniture and even wallpaper as well as other household accessories such as cushions, mirrors and clocks.

There is even items for the garden such as patio sets and barbecues.

On the mezzanine level there is a clothes and accessories section selling clothes, handbags, jewellery and shoes.

One of the first customers in the store was Julie Brookes, 45, whose son Ian has been helped by the charity.

He suffers from Aspergers Syndrome, a form of autism, which affects how suffers react in social situations.

Mrs Brookes said: 'I think the store is fantastic - and the money raised is going to such a good cause.'

Upmarket charity shops such as this one in Stockton-on-Tees are on the rise, with the number of charity shops rising by 30 per cent since 2008

The number of charity shops in Britian has increased by 30 per cent since 2008 and they have performed well financially against other High Street shops.

More and more stores are sprucing up their shop floors to give themselves more of a boutique or superstore feel to draw in customers.

In some stores, gone are the disorganised rails of old clothes and piles of books as they have been replaced with bright, modern interiors with some even selling one-off vintage items and unwanted designer goods.

Last year, David and Victoria Beckham donated more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes to the Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea in London to support the Typhoon Haiyan appeal.

Shoppers wanting to get their hands on some of the couple's old designer clothes queued around the block in a bid to buy some of their unwanted items.

In addition, the charity Oxfam has eight shops, which they describe as boutiques, selling one-off, sometimes vintage clothes to help their cause.

Retail guru Mary Portas also took on charity shops in one of her TV series saying they needed to become 'less smelly' if they were to help revive the High Street.

Ms Portas, helps to runs 11 stores for Save the Children, agreed that charity shops had a ‘vital role’ to play saving the high street.

And last year she said: 'If you create a charity shop that is a beautiful, respectful place people will give you great stuff and actually respect it in a better way, which in turn makes more money for charity.'
