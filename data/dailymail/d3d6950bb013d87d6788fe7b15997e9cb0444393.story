Kurdish protesters who today staged a mock ISIS-style execution in London  after Alan Henning was killed by the terror group have been blasted for mocking his death.

Two men were pictured wearing blood-spattered orange jumpsuits with knives held to their throats outside Downing Street today as part of Kurdish protests demanding stronger action against ISIS.

However their actions have been 'condemned' by a Muslim group, who said Mr Henning's death should not be used for political gain.

Shocking: Kurdish anti-war protesters stage mock ISIS-style beheadings outside Downing Street today

Anger: The demonstration came just a day after Alan Henning was beheaded by ISIS fighter Jihadi John

Opposition: The demonstrators, some of whom have been on hunger strike since Wednesday, are demanding more heavy weapons to help Kurdish fighters defeat ISIS

Mohammed Shafiq, the cheif executive of the Ramadan Foundation, said: 'I think anyone who has seen the outpouring of grief today will be totally disgusted by anyone who is staging mock executions.

'The Kurdish activists have a right to protest and demand extra weapons, what they do not have the right to do is mock Mr Henning’s death and recreate the execution.

'We reject this and condemn it without hesitation. What today should be about is Barbara and Mr Henning's family, not about trying to use the death for political gain.' 

Several hundred Kurdish activists, some of whom have been on hunger strike in central London since Wednesday, are demanding heavy weapons and anti-tank missiles for use against ISIS.

They fear the town of Kobani, on the Syria-Turkey border, is about to be overrun by the terror group, which could lead to another massacre. 

Their actions are likely to increase the emotional strain on Alan Henning's family, who have already said they are 'numb with grief'.

Paying tribute to her husband today, Barbara Henning said: 'As a family we are devastated by the news of his death. There are few words to describe how we feel at this moment. 

'Myself, Lucy and Adam, and all of Alan's family and friends are numb with grief.Alan was a decent, caring human being. His interest was in the welfare of others. 

'He will be remembered for this and we as a family are extremely proud of him and what he achieved and the people he helped.'

Mr Henning's brother also expressed hatred for the terrorists, describing the killers as 'scum', and saying he hoped they 'get what's coming to them'. 

Protest: Some activists have vowed to go on hunger strike outside Downing Street until their demands are met

Hurt: The protest will likely cause further hurt to Mr Henning's family who say they are already 'numb with grief'

Elsewhere today the Stop the War Coalition also organised a march to Donwing Street, calling for Britain to halt it's bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq. 

Holding placards that say 'stop bombing Iraq' and 'don't attack Syria', activists branded the attacks on Islamic State 'insane'.

Referring to the brutal murder of British aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of Islamic State Francis O'Neill, 36, from Oxford said he had 'every sympathy' with his family, but said dropping bombs is not the answer.

Mr O'Neill said Britain inflicts 'equal barbarity' on the people of Iraq, but people here feel 'distanced' from it. 

'Whether you see someone being beheaded or being hit by a drone strike...It makes no difference.'

RAF jets began bombing missions against militant positions in Iraq a week ago and David Cameron announced that two more Tornado bombers will join the mission on Thursday.

Mr Cameron has said he is also considering extending bombardments to Syria, the stronghold of ISIS, where the U.S. and other allies are already attacking.

However, the Prime Minister has said he will seek fresh parliamentary approval before doing so.
