Mia Farrow has admitted that Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son, instead of Woody Allen.

Rumours
 about the parentage of her son Ronan, 25, have long dogged Mia Farrow, and she finally addressed
 the issue in an interview saying the legendary crooner was 'possibly' 
his father.

But on Wednesday, in reference to the claims, Ronan Farrow put in his two cents by tweeting: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.'

It comes as 
her adopted daughter Dylan spoke for the first time about how she is 
tormented by 'crippling' fears over her alleged abuse at the hands of 
Woody Allen in a new Vanity Fair article.

Claim: Mia Farrow has admitted Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son Ronan, instead of Woody Allen

Dylan Farrow reveals that she refuses to ever say her famous adopted 
father’s name and admitted: ‘I’m scared of him, his image.’

The
 Oscar-winning director, now 77, has always vehemently denied his former
 partner Mia Farrow’s claim that he sexually molested Dylan and no 
charges were brought after the scandal made headlines around the world 
20 years ago.

Elsewhere in 
the interview, Farrow, now 68, said that 
Sinatra was the great love of her life, and says, 'We never really split
 up.'

Relationship: Farrow fell for the legendary crooner Frank Sinatra and married him in 1966 when she was 21 and he was 50

When Vanity Fair asked
 Sinatra's daughter about Ronan being treated as if he were a member of 
her family, Nancy Sinatra Jr told them: 'He is a big part of us, and we 
are blessed to have him in our lives.'

Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50.

The
 marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her 
critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie 
with her husband. They divorced in 1968.

Two
 years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The 
couple adopted three children and also had three biological children 
before divorcing in 1979.

In
 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, 
although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and 
starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986.

Any similarities? Farrow dropped the bombshell that Sinatra, left, could be the biological father of her son, Ronan (right) in a Vanity Fair interview. He has taken to Twitter to dismiss her claims

Her
 relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having
 an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22.

It was believed that the
 news Allen may not be his father could be welcome to Ronan - the 
pair had a very public falling out when Allen began his romantic 
relationship with Previn.

Claims: Dylan Farrow, pictured with adopted father Allen in 1989, claimed he sexually abused her

'He's
 my father and married to my sister. That makes me his son and his 
brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said.

'I
 cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be 
morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they 
are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all 
adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship.

Following
 the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Farrow 
launched a messy custody battle over their three children.

During
 the proceedings, which were closely followed, Farrow claimed that Allen
 had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan, though the judge dismissed 
the claims because they were not substantiated.

But
 Dylan – who is reportedly married and has changed her name to Malone – 
now says: ‘I have never been asked to testify. If I could talk to the 
seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify.

‘There’s
 a lot I don’t remember, but what happened in the attic I remember. I 
remember what I was wearing and what I wasn’t wearing,’ she tells Vanity
 Fair’s November issue.

‘The
 things making me uncomfortable were making me think I was a bad kid, 
because I didn’t want to do what my elder told me to do.’

The
 attic, she adds, pushed her over the edge. ‘I was cracking. I had to 
say something. I was seven. I was doing it because I was scared. I 
wanted it to stop.’

She 
told the magazine that for all she knew ‘this was how fathers treated 
their daughters. This was normal interaction, and I was not normal for 
feeling uncomfortable about it.’

The
 ‘Midnight in Paris’ director’s New York publicist was unavailable for 
comment on the claims early today. His lawyer Elkan Abramowitz told the 
magazine that he still denies the allegations of sexual abuse.

Dylan claims in her first interview that Allen contacted her twice by post.

The
 second time, during her senior year of university, a large stuffed 
manila envelope arrived at the school, filled with pictures of the pair 
of them together.

According 
to her, the accompanying letter read, ‘I thought you’d want some 
pictures of us, and I want you to know that I still think of you as my 
daughter, and my daughters think of you as their sister. Soon-Yi misses 
you.’

Eight of Farrow’s 14 adopted and biological children spoke for the article.

Fletcher
 Previn reveals that he 
has photoshopped Allen out of every single family photo and edited him 
out of family videos so that none of them would ever have to see him 
again.

'We can look at them and be reminded of the good and not be reminded of the bad,’ Fletcher tells writer Maureen Orth.

Of
 the two decades old scandal, he adds: ’There were casualties, who were 
totally derailed. It had a different impact on everyone, but everyone 
had a reaction.’

Fletcher singles out his sister Lark, who died at 35. ‘I really do think he’s got some blood on his hands,’ he says of Allen.

Farrow
 had a 12-year relationship with Allen, whose latest film ‘Blue Jasmine’
 had the director’s best ever UK opening this summer - but the couple 
never lived together.

She and the children stayed in her massive Upper West Side New York apartment while he had a home on the other side of the city.

In
 a 2005 interview, Allen confirmed that he no longer has relationships 
with his three children from his relationship with Farrow.

'Well,
 I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in 
court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair.

Today,
 Farrow is far removed from the media circus. Her focus is now activism,
 in Africa, as a UNICEF ambassador and on more than 20 missions of her 
own, particularly to the Darfur region of Sudan and to neighboring 
Chad.

Ronan says he is ‘so proud’ of his large family.

‘I
 grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next 
to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and 
Minh, who is blind,’ he tells Vanity Fair.

‘I
 could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with 
cerebral palsy. I saw problems and needs, so the next thing you think 
is: "O.K., what are you going to do about it?", he adds.

And the strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy.

He
 enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving
 on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a
 year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree.

Since
 leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State 
Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and
 Pakistan.

He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009.

After
 working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now 
moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with
 Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination.

In spite of the drama, Soon-Yi and Allen stayed together, eventually marrying in 1997.

The couple have since adopted two children named Bechet and Manzie Tio, their names paying homage to two jazz musicians.

'The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things,' Allen has said.
