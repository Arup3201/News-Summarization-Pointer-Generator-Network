A woman driving an ambulance and an elderly patient were killed this morning when the vehicle crashed into a tree, police said today.

The ambulance is believed to have left the road after the accident involving a car, which happened in the New Forest in Hampshire shortly after 9.30am today.

The driver of the car, a man in his 20s, was arrested at the scene of the accident on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention.

'I thought nothing of it at the time, but as I got to the other side of Brockenhurst the traffic had stopped dead.'

The double-crewed ambulance belonged to South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SCAS) and was transporting the patient to Southampton General Hospital.

'South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust is conducting appropriate welfare checks with the families of all involved,' a spokesman for the service said.
