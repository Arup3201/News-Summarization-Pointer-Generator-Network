Adi Viveash's Chelsea U19s side stormed into the UEFA Youth League final following a 4-0 mauling of Roma in the semis. 

After a tense and goalless first-half, midfielder Charlie Colckett's deflected shot gave Chelsea the lead. Striker Dominic Solanke then scored a brace, before substitute Tammy Abraham wrapped up the win with a tap in on 83 minutes.

Chelsea will now face Shakhtar Donetsk's U19s team in the final.

Roma had initially defended strongly, but capitulated after the break. 

Chelsea made two changes from the side that started the quarter-final victory over Atletico Madrid last month, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Charly Musonda coming into the line-up. 

Andreas Christensen, who started in midfield against Atletico, was paired with Jake Clarke-Salter at centre-back, while Ola Aina and Jay DaSilva occupied the full-back positions. 

Loftus-Cheek was partnered in midfield by Colkett and Musonda, with the latter operating in the hole behind the front-three of Solanke, Jeremie Boga and captain Izzy Brown.

Chelsea were rewarded for their persistence in the second-half with two goals inside four minutes of the restart. The first came at the end of a driving run from Brown, which saw the ball bounce kindly into the path of Colkett for him to wrong-foot the goalkeeper with an awkward shot.  

A second goal followed from Christensen's excellent long ball forward, met by the run of Solanke who rounded the rushing keeper to fire into an empty net. 

After Boga had an attempt spilled by the keeper, Solanke was on hand to poach his second and Chelsea's third. Solanke has now netted 11 goals in this year's Youth League and is the competition's leading scorer. 

The rout was completed when Abraham, on from the bench, converted Kasey Palmer's cross.
