These are the incredible images of a daredevil boldly gliding with a trapeze artist dangling from his parachute.

The professional circus performer and paragliding pilot performed gravity-busting acrobatics over the Lake Annecy in Geneva.

The astonishing act sees fearless trapeze entertainer Roxane Giliand take to the skies before dropping down 12ft below pilot Gill Schneider with no shoes or helmet on.

She is held on by one safety tie as she swings in the air 600m above ground.

The nail-biting actions were captured by adventure filmmaker Adrien who paraglided alongside the pair to have a close up view of the remarkable flight.

And despite having to combat blistery winds and lethal heights, the duo insisted that their moment must be captured perfectly - so demanded the film crew record them doing it again.

Outdoor enthusiast Adrien, 31, said: 'I was shooting the video with the trapezist and it was the last sequence to shoot before ending the video.

Pilot Gill Schneider, 29, came up with the idea to have Roxane perform with him at a great height. He teamed up with his father's circus class to mix juggling, trapeze and other circus arts with paragliding

'They were pretty far away the first, so they insisted we do it again get closer and show audiences.

'I'm delighted we did it because people were completely amazed.'

Pilot Gill, 29, came up with the idea to have Roxane perform and teamed up with his father's circus class to mix juggling, trapeze and other circus arts with paragliding.

The courageous duo surprised all involved by calmly taking to the skies and caused a stir among spectators who avidly watched their intrepid act.

Adrien said: 'People were completely 
amazed.

'A lot of them nearby took pictures when we were shooting and it 
was really fun to entertain them.

'But actually, they were pretty far away, so we hope that the images can bring them closer to the action.'

Onlookers have been shocked and amazed at the feats. The film crew recorded the performers twice to get the best images possible

Double the skill: Talented circus performers were captured working with incredible focus
