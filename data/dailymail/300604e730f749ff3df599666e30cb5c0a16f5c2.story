A teenage student was horrified to wake up after a drunken DIY tattoo party to find friends had inked a penis on her shoulder.

Holly Aston, a self-confessed former 'wild child', said the embarrassing tattoo had 'ruined her life' as she cancelled holidays and postponed university because she feared it would be 'revealed'.

She was just 17 when she allowed drunken friends to draw 'whatever they wanted' on her with a DIY tattoo gun she had bought on the internet.

The teenager from Birmingham, now 20, kept it hidden from her parents for two years, but now the truth has come out.

'I had tattoo parties with my mates. We'd have some drinks and tattoo each other - it was stupid,' she said.

'It was during one of those parties that things got out of hand. I let my mates draw whatever they wanted.

'I have the word 'Dyke' on my ankle, and then one drew the penis on my shoulder. I knew what they were doing and didn't mind at the time. It was just a joke and I thought it was funny.

'But then I woke up the next day, looked at it and thought 'Oh God, what have I done?'

'I had to keep it covered up in the summer; if I went swimming I tried to cover it with plasters because I didn't want children seeing it.

'I turned down family holidays because I was hiding it from my mum and dad. I thought they'd kill me.'

The self-confessed former 'wild child' also has a tattoo of Storm from X Men on her forearm 

Miss Aston has a diploma in animal management and wants to study animal behaviour and welfare, but said she couldn't afford to remove it.

'I want to go to university this year and to be taken seriously without this silly tattoo, but I can't afford the thousands of pounds it would cost to remove it,' she said.

She said it was easy to buy a tattoo gun off the internet for about £50, but there was no instructions about keeping it sterile.

'We were very lucky not to get an infection or blood poisoning,' she said.

'I had my first tattoo done by a qualified bloke who had turned part of his house into a studio.

'I had a large picture done on my forearm of a comic book woman. It's supposed to be Storm from X Men, although I just chose it out of a book because I thought it was cool.

She is appearing on Channel 4 series Bodyshockers: Nips, Tucks and Tattoos tonight with presenter Katie Piper (centre) who helps her tell her horrified parents

'My family hated it but I still went on to get more.' 

She is appearing on Channel 4 series Bodyshockers: Nips, Tucks and Tattoos tonight and the production team has paid for her to get her three tattoos removed by laser in Harley Street.

Katie Piper, who battled back from an horrific acid attack, helped Miss Aston break the news to her horrified parents as part of the programme.

'She helped me tell my parents, who reacted better than I thought they would,' said Miss Aston.

'I thought they'd be really angry but my mum Patricia was more disappointed that I hadn't told her about it.' 

'I thought Katie would look at me and think 'What an idiot' but she saw the funny side.'

The 19-year-old has just had her fifth session and said her tattoos are almost gone.

'I feel like I can start afresh now,' she said.
