A toddler whose mother was struggling to kick a heroin habit died after drinking methadone from a child's beaker that was left on a set of drawers in his parents’ home, a court heard today.

Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March after drinking the drug from a beaker left in the room of his mother Sally Dent and father Shaun Binfield, where he also slept.

Dent and Binfield are now on trial, charged with their son's manslaughter and cruelty to a person under 16 as it is alleged they failed to keep methadone and other drugs out of the reach of the child.

Tragic: Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March after drinking methadone from a child's beaker that was left on a set of drawers in his parents' home, Nottingham Crown Court heard

Opening her prosecution case, Yvonne Coen QC told a jury at Nottingham Crown Court that Dent, who repeatedly dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock, was struggling to get over a heroin habit.

Dent has a history of drug use going back many years and is being prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the habit, Ms Coen told the court.

A child's beaker with methadone was left on a set of drawers in his parents’ bedroom where he also slept, so it would be ‘within easy reach’ of his mother, Ms Coen alleged.

Dent awoke to find Riley unconscious in bed next to her and called 999 on March 13 last year.

She described her son to police as ‘a gorgeous little boy’ and a ‘loveable rogue who got up to the usual mischief’, the court heard.

‘Not only would (the beaker) have attracted him to it like a little bee to a honeypot but it was also within easy reach of him,’ she said.

It was ‘grave negligence’ by his parents to leave the dangerous drug in a beaker, which the toddler would have thought was juice, the prosecutor told the court.

Paramedics arrived to find Riley lifeless. His heart had stopped beating and his lips were blue, Ms Coen told the court. The toddler was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after arriving.

Friends and family of the couple wept in the dock as Ms Coen told the jury that post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal.

He is believed to have consumed between 10ml and 20ml of methadone, the court heard.

The couple originally told officers that Riley must have climbed on top of a wardrobe in the bedroom where the methadone was usually stored in a locked wooden box, Ms Coen told the court.

She claims that Binfield, who was watching television in the other room on the morning of the incident, let Riley go back into the bedroom unsupervised, knowing that methadone was within his reach and knowing that Dent was sleeping off drugs she had taken the night before.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow and the pair - who both deny all the charges - remain on bail.
