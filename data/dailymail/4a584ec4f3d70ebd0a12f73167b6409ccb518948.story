A London-based designer has come up with a collection of zombie-proof vehicles, just in time for Halloween.

Donal O'Keeffe from Cork in Ireland, created the Zombie Survival Series with 3D rendering after being inspired by his love of horror films.

The 31-year-old put the collection together after imagining what city-life would be like if the streets were taken over by wandering undead, from which there would be no safer escape than one of these modified, mobile fortresses.

Graphic designer Donal O'Keeffe was inspired to create the collection with 3D Rendering by his love of horror films and fascination with how they 'put people out of their comfort zone'

A typical London bus is kitted out with survival equipment including barrels for water and canned foods in the collection which imagines survival in a post-apocalyptic world

'The concept for the series sprouted from my love of detailed 3D cross section renders,' said O'Keeffe, who works predominantly within broadcast.Â 

'Their inherit ability to infuse narrative through the placement of 
details.

'I really wanted the viewer to study and create for themselves, 
to theorise about whom the survivor or survivors are and what kind of 
background they came from.'

'I paired this interest with my love of horror films and their ability to place people outside their comfort zones.'

'I felt the concept of an end of civilization/zombie attack would be 
an ideal way to explain these bizarre and abnormal creations.'

His designs range from a London taxi to a Royal Mail van stuffed with survival foods including potatoes and baked beans.

Speaking to core77.com, the designer said: 'Each one was rendered and created for large format printing.

'Plus I 
felt the concept of protection from the outside world and our attempt to
 cling onto some form of reality was fascinating.

The graphic designer from Cork, Ireland, said he was inspired by his love of 3D rendering as well as his passion for films such as Zombieland, starring Jesse Eisenberg

'These themes lead me to the zombie survival vehicles.'

Alongside basic necessities like water and food are more personalised items imagined by O'Keeffe with individual characters in mind.

Photographs, books and rosary beads are among weapons such as knives and rifles, as the driver tried to imagine people who 'live, drive and survive' in the modified vehicles.

'I also wanted to put some small detailed textures somewhere in the vehicles - blood stains, scrawled writings, pop culture designs etc,' he said.

'I've also had people interested in commissioning new pieces personal to them, such as modeling their father's car and filling it with his favorite possessions. Even modeling and designing whole buildings.'

'From the bookshelf on the upper storage space of the royal mail van to the American flag stuck in the grille of the yellow taxi.'

All of the vehicles are equipped with a map at the driver's seat.

In addition to fuel reserves they each have a weapon of choice ranging from pick-axes to machine guns.

Prints of the images can be purchased online.
