Fair condition: Doctors still do not know what caused Teresa Heinz's seizure-like symptoms on Sunday

The doctors treating Secretary of State John Kerry's wife have ruled out a brain tumor or a stroke but are still unable to determine what caused her seizure-like symptoms.

Teresa Heinz, John Kerry's 74-year-old wife, was rushed to the local hospital on Sunday when she had the mysterious health incident during a vacation at their family's vacation home on Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts.

After stabilizing her condition, she was flown by private jet to Boston where the experts at Massachusetts General Hospital have not yet been able to determine the root problem.

By Tuesday afternoon, they have added heart attack to the list of possible explanations that they ruled out.

'As evaluations continue, she, Secretary of State John Kerry, and their family are deeply grateful that physicians have ruled out a variety of possible triggers or other ailments, including heart attack, stroke, or a brain tumor,' Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement.

Though her condition was initially deemed critical, she was downgraded to fair on Monday.

Kerry is expected to leave her side for the first time on Tuesday as he heads to Washington briefly in order to formally begin a long-planned U.S.-China economic conference before returning to Boston later tonight.

Heinz, seen with Kerry when the election results came in during the 2004 election, is said to be very happy that he is the Secretary of State and is okay with him traveling much of the year

The decision for him to leave seems to be one that his wife would approve of.

The Washington Post's gossip column, Reliable Sources, says that she has been telling friends that she is very proud of him for the work he is doing as the nation's top diplomat.

Though she was supportive of his dashed presidential aspirations when he ran in 2004, many took her personal wealth and worldliness as detractors.

Heinz, who inherited her first husband's money from his family's stake in the eponymous ketchup company when he died in a plane crash in 1991, speaks five languages and spends her time working with charities and raising awareness for breast cancer research.

She was diagnosed with the disease in 2009 and had several lumpectomies and radiation treatments to treat the cancer.
