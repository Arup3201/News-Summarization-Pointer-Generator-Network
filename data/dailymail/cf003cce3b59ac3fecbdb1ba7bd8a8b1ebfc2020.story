A charming video shows how one family's pet pygmy anteater makes sure an infant kangaroo stays off his turf.

The clip shows the moment the anteater stands on two legs and spreads his like a scarecrow, sending the frightened joey hopping sharply away.

It was filmed and uploaded by U.S.-based writer and conservationist Julia Heckathorn, who keeps the exotic animals to educate children. 

I am anteater, hear me roar: The pygmy anteater stands up on its hind legs in an intimidating pose

Mummy! This kangaroo joey knows its best to make a sharp exit when his anteater housemate comes by

The anteater's bizarre scarecrow pose is in fact the very same defensive position it would adopt if it felt threatened in the world.

In their natural habitat of Central and South America, pygmy anteaters' main enemies are jaguars and pumas which hunt them in the grasslands, swampy areas, and forests where they live.

When chased into a corner, the anteaters would rear up on their hind legs, roar loudly and slash desperately with the sharp claws on their front legs.

Ms Heckathorn's Search For The Hidden Clover project combines her writing and art with educational events and conservation work.

USDA licensed to keep and exhibit exotic animals, she works to raise awareness of endangered and at risk species from all over the world. 

Her current conservation project (and subject of her latest book) is saving the three-toed pygmy sloth species and their habitat, Escudo Island, Panama.

You can see more of here videos on her YouTube channel and find out more about their upcoming projects on their Facebook page.
