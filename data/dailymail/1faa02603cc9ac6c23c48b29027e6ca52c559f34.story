Pet lovers across the nation are outraged at a Michigan woman whose dog ate a bag of marijuana — then laughed as the poor pooch got stoned.

Laure Milsee said she came home to find that Thor, a 3-year-old pitbull mix, looked lethargic and was drooling.

She soon discovered why.

'So my dog Thor has gotten into our bag of weed. He ate $20 in weed,' she says in a video of the incident, which went viral after it was posted on Facebook.

'So he's super duper f******' fried. I don't know what to do. I hope he doesn't die. He's tripping.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

In the video, Milsee at first sounds concerned as Thor struggles to remain standing.

But then she begins to laugh uncontrollably as the dog falls over and hits his head against a wooden door.

Milsee told a local news station that she posted the video out of concern, so her boyfriend could see how the dog was acting and help her figure out what to do.

'Because I laughed at the end, people are taking it as though I'm cruel 
to him — I'm not,' Milsee told  WXYZ. 'It was late. I had spoke to one of my
 girlfriends who is an animal advocate and she said to keep giving him 
water and bread.'

Thor has covered from the incident and is back to normal, his owner says

Milsee
 told the station that animal control is looking into the incident.

But 
she insists she took him to the vet afterward and has the paperwork to 
confirm Thor is just fine.

'I love my animal,' she told WXYZ. 'I love my kid. I have a cat too. I take care of my animals.

'It was a mistake. I shouldn't have posted the video.'

Dog owner Laure Milsee says she took Thor to the vet after the incident and was told he was doing fine.
