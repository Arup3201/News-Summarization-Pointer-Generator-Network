RadioShack is a step closer to closing after the New York Stock Exchange sought to follow up its recent suspension of the company's shares with a delisting from the exchange. 

The company that introduced the first mass-market personal computer looks set to go out of business  after years of heavy losses.

Up to 27,500 jobs are at risk at the beleaguered retailer which thrived through decades of changing home electronics technology.

The retailer has tried to woo customers with a nostalgia drive, decking out stores with examples of early equipment it once sold.

But hope of a turnaround for the Texas company is fading fast as the New York Stock Exchange seeks to delist it after suspending trade of its shares on Monday.

Store managers have been instructed to ship big-ticket items to more profitable locations while some of its 5,500 stores continue to close. 

Half a dozen store managers told The Associated Press that they have been instructed not to talk about the company's dire financial straits.

The company received rescue financing from a group of investors led by hedge fund Standard General after a bankruptcy warning in September but its CEO recently admitted it might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay afloat.

Analysts say online retailers including Amazon have contributed to RadioShack's decline.

'Every year, RadioShack's core customer grew a year older and new consumers realized they would never set foot in one,' said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.

RadioShack spokeswoman Merianne Roth declined to comment.

Long known as a destination for batteries and obscure electronic parts, the company has sought to remake itself as a specialist in wireless devices and accessories.

In a management shake-up, RadioShack hired Walgreen Co. executive Joseph Magnacca and former Treasury Department adviser Harry J. Wilson to help with its turnaround efforts. 

It worked with popular brands like Beats Audio and redesigned almost half of its U.S. locations — some 2,000 stores — in an effort to entice younger shoppers.

But growth in the wireless business is slowing, as more people already have smartphones and see fewer reasons to upgrade their equipment.

RadioShack, which has not turned a profit since 2011, still operates nearly 5,500 stores and employs about 27,500 people worldwide, according to its last annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company, founded in Boston in 1921, began as a distributor of mail-order ship radios, ham radios and parts. 

In the 1950s, it entered the high-fidelity business, touting a device called the 'Audio Comparator,' a then-novel switching system that allowed the customer to mix and match components and speakers in the listening room.

In 1977, RadioShack started selling the TRS-80, known affectionately by its users as the Trash 80, making the company as important in the microcomputer space as IBM or Apple.

Fort Worth financial planner Jay Ellis fondly remembers setting up walkie-talkies from kits sold at RadioShack.

'I think it's a shame. They were the go-to place for electronics parts,' he said. Now, 'it seems to be a mobile phone and remote-control toy store. If they're still selling kits, they're not marketing them very well.'
