On what turned out to be a rather mild Monday night in Stoke, Chelsea picked up a crucial 2-0 win which ensures that Jose Mourinho's side are top of the Premier League at Christmas.

It means the Stamford Bridge club have lost just one of their last 20 league matches played on a Monday, having won 12 and drawn seven.

But they still have have much work to do to catch Manchester United in a league table ranked by Premier League games won on the first day of the week.

While Chelsea currently sit in eighth position, it is United who are kings of the 'Monday club', having won 38 of their 55 games, a win percentage of 69.1 per cent.

Considering United went through a recent 14-month gap - from August 2013 to October 2014 - without playing a league match on a Monday night, it is a decent feat to still be top of the table.

Although Chelsea have played just 42 matches on a Monday, their win percentage is considerably lower having won 19 (45.2 per cent).

Arsenal sit in second place with 30 wins in 55 games (54.5 per cent), while Manchester City are in third with 27 victories in 60 (45 per cent).

Tottenham Hotspur have played the most matches on a Monday of any side in Premier League history, although they are yet to experience one this season. The White Hart Lane club has 26 wins in 65 matches (40 per cent).

West Ham are no strangers to a Monday match, having played 64. However, they have only picked up 18 wins, hence a disappointing percentage of 28.1 per cent.

West Brom may look ahead to their match against Everton at Goodison Park on Monday January 19 with trepidation. The Baggies have a woeful record on a Monday with a win percentage of just 10.5 per cent (two in 19), which is the worst percentage of any side who has registered at least one win.

Sunderland also have a poor record of five wins in 32 (15.6 per cent), while Hull are still to win a match on a Monday after six attempts. Bear in mind that these teams are likely to face one of the bigger clubs in one of Sky Sports' showpiece TV slots.

A special mention must go to Sheffield Wednesday. The Owls have an impressive record of 15 wins in 24 Monday Premier League matches (62.5 per cent), although they have not played in the top flight since being relegated in 2000.

The next Monday night match we look forward to is Liverpool against Swansea at Anfield on December 29. For the record, Liverpool have 26 wins in 60 (43.3 per cent), while Swansea have won just one in four (25 per cent).
