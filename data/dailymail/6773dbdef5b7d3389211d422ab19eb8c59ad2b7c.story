Senator Dianne Feinstein has gone on record saying she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells present in the US laying in wait to carry out an attack similar to the deadly incidents that rocked Paris last week.

The California Democrat and former Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman made the ominous comments while appearing on CNN's State of the Union Sunday to talk about the waiver program, which allows foreign nationals from 38 countries to enter the US for up to 90 days without a visa.

Calling the waiver program 'America's Achilles heel,' Feinstein noted that the people suspected of shooting up the offices of the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo and attacking a Kosher grocery store in Paris were French citizens - and people from France are permitted to enter the US without a visa.

Ominous remarks: Senator Dianne Feinstein said on CNN she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells present in the US

Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured here January 11 at an International meeting against terrorism in Paris, said the US is keeping track on suspicious individuals

While brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, responsible for the murders of 12 Charlie Hebdo staffers, were on a no-fly list, Senator Feinstein pointed out that had they wanted to enter the US, they could have done so using a fake passport.

‘They can come back from training, they go through a visa waiver country, and they come into this country,’ Feinstein said. ‘We have a big problem here.’

Feinstein, who has long been a vocal critic of the waiver program expanded under President George W. Bush to boost tourism, issued a warning against terrorist sleeper cells on US soil.

‘I think there are sleeper cells, not only in France, but certainly in other countries, and, yes, even in our own,’ Feinstein said. ‘So I think this calls for vigilance. It calls for seeing that the national security organizations of our country -- the intelligence community -- is funded fully, is directed ably, is cooperating with ... British intelligence, French intelligence, German intelligence, as we do.’

The attacks in France last week left a total of 17 people dead over the course of three bloody days, including 12 cartoonists and staff at Charlie Hebdo and four shoppers shot dead inside a grocery store during a hostage crisis perpetrated by the Kouchi brothers’ accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly.

Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack by the masked gunmen to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly's satire.

All three suspects were killed by French police during near-simultaneous raids at a suburban printing plant and the Kosher market in Paris.

Recent polls show that Americans are deeply concerns about a similar terrorist attack at home.

A Rasmussen poll released Sunday found that 65 per cent of Americans believe it is at least somewhat that an attack on 'those critical of Islam' in the US will occur over the next year, reported the Washington Times. 

During his appearance on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder tried to reassure the public that the Obama administration is doing everything possible to keep tabs on suspicious individuals.

‘We have a universe of people who we focus on using legitimate means and keep track of them,’ Holder said, adding that they have no information at this time on specific threats.

Congressman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said over the weekend that the House Homeland Security Committee, which he chairs, plans to launch an investigation to identify potential security loopholes in the visa waiver program.

‘I think we need to take a look at the visa waiver program again, and see what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening, because I believe it will happen, if it hasn't already,’ McCaul said.

The White House also announced that President Obama will host an anti-extremism summit February 18 to discuss ways to stop the radicalization and recruitment of Americans by terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS.
