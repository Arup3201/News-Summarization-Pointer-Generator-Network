Arsene Wenger has hit back at the critics of Mesut Ozil, after he failed to impress yet again during Arsenal's defeat 2-0 at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday night.

Non-existent throughout, the Gunners' record signing was hauled off after just 62 minutes, and much of the criticism of the midfielder's recent displays has been nothing short of scathing.

But Wenger insisted that the Germany World Cup winner will soon be back to his best and that his heat maps are proof that he is still having a key influence on games - despite the fact Ozil is yet to register a goal or assist this season,.

'Why should he be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1,' said Wenger.

'Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what?

'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game. You have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life.'

It has been suggested that the formation Arsenal are currently playing, with Ozil often playing out on the right, does not suit the German's talents. But Wenger believes that is merely a side issue.

'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch.'

Here then, are Ozil's heat maps from his last four Arsenal games:

They show that Ozil's involvement was minimal in the defeat in Dortmund and he was stuck out on the left against Everton.

However, Wenger was half right as Ozil popped up more in the centre against Manchester City and particularly at Leicester. 

On the Dortmund debacle, Wenger added: 'It’s a bit unfair because I believe that our offensive talents on Tuesday night [against Borussia Dortmund] were not in their best condition, and they couldn’t express that talent.

'On the other hand it’s post-World Cup. He came back on August 11. You know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best, that can happen.

'They should not be concerned and just support him. I understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good. You help.

'A club is a union between players, supporters and directors. You have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well.'

Wenger revealed that Mathieu Debuchy will undergo an exploratory operation on his ankle injury this evening which will determine how long he is out for.

If he does not need further surgery, it will be six weeks before his return, but if he needs to go under the knife it will rule him out for at least three months.

'We’ll know tonight [Friday]. He has an exploration of his ankle tonight and they go in and look how the ligament is damaged, and after that we know if he does need surgery.

'If he doesn’t, it’ll be six weeks, if he does need surgery it’ll be three months. At the moment we don’t know.'

Calum Chambers, who missed the Dortmund game through illness, is set to return this weekend, and the 19-year-old looks set slot in at right back in the absence of Debuchy.

'I like his attitude, I like his intelligence and I like the fact that he came into the team with a good resistance to the pressure and just played his game,' said Wenger of Chambers. 'I am very impressed by him.'
