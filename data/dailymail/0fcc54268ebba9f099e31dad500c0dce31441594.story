It's a virus that originated in birds, but the newest strain of avian flu has killed 162 harbor seals in New England and scientists warn it could be even more dangerous if it jumps to humans.

Researchers revealed on Tuesday that the aquatic mammals, which washed up dead or dying on the shores of Maine and northern Massachusetts last fall, were infected with the H3N8 strain of influenza.

The seals suffered horrifying skin lesions, a previously unknown symptom in flu deaths, and pneumonia as a result of a virus that they contracted from North American waterfowl, according to researchers at Columbia University.

Even more worrying is the fact that the virus has mutated to develop the ability to infect the cells of mammals -- a first for the avian pathogen.

New threat: Flu killed more than 100 harbour seals in New England last year after jumping from waterfowl

The announcement follows the reemergence
of swine flu in the United States as four people at a county fair in 
Indiana had to be hospitalized after catching the virus from their hogs.

Scientists believe the virus entered the seals' bodies by infecting the small number of cells with avian receptors that the species carries.

Once inside, the pathogen mutated to infect cells with mammalian receptors -- making it much more potent and allowing for the possibility that the strain could infect humans.

'Whenever you get a virus that spills over from one species into another and causes disease that is a significant concern,' Dr Simon Anthony, a research fellow at Columbia University's Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiologic Research, told Mail Online.

'When you get a virus jumping over from distantly-related species like waterfowl to seals, it's cause for even greater concern.

'And and when that disease mutates to infect a new kind of receptor and cause disease, it's even more concerning.'

Researchers say there is no evidence the virus can infect humans now, but they worry about the potential effects of the virulent strain if it is able to mutate further and infect humans.

Deadly: The strain of flu that infected the seals is disturbing because scientists never predicted the virus was mutate from waterfowl to marine mammals

Unlike the H1N1 'swine flu' outbreak in 2009, which infected millions of people but killed only 0.002 percent, the so-called 'seal flu' could prove much deadlier.

However, it looks as though swine flu is back in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control counts 17 cases of the H3N2 strain since 2011.

The most recent outbreak came at the LaPorte County Fair in northern Indiana when four people were hospitalized for flu-like symptoms.

All of the cases were people who had handled hogs at the fair barn. Several of the animals tested positive for the same virus, which has traces of bird flu.

H3N8 has evolved mutations known to ease transmission and cause more severe symptoms. Specifically, the virus has the ability to target proteins known as cytokines found in human lungs.

Deadly: Scientists are worried because the flu strain appears far deadlier than the H1N1 strain, which kills just 0.002 percent of infected people in 2009

This could cause the immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself, causing tissue damage.

Dr
Anne Moscona, from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, who 
led the researchers, said: 'There is a concern that we have a new 
mammalian-transmissible virus to which humans haven't been exposed yet. 
It's a combination we haven't seen in disease before.'

The strain is closely related to one that has been circulating in North American birds since 2002. But unlike the bird strain, it has adapted to living in mammals.

The warning from scientists is published in the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology, mBio.

Outbreak: Flu cases are low in North America and Europe, though the east coast of Africa and southeast Asia continue to struggle with outbreaks

One cause for concern was the fact that few scientists had considered the possibility of a bird flu virus infecting seals, said the researchers. It highlighted the fact that pandemic influenza can appear in unexpected ways.

'Flu could emerge from anywhere and our readiness has to be much better than we previously realised,' said Dr Moscona.

'We need to be very nimble in our ability to identify and understand the potential risks posed by new viruses emerging from unexpected sources.

'It's important to realise that viruses can emerge through routes that we haven't considered. We need to be alert to those risks and ready to act on them.'

As of January 2012, the World Health Organization has confirmed there have been 583 cases of H5N1 (avian flu) in humans leading to 344 deaths.

Avian flu has all but disappeared from the headlines since the 2009 swine flu pandemic, but it continues to sweep across the globe, jumping from birds to humans to swine and back again. 

The flu has taken numerous forms since it first mutated and passed from birds to humans -- with varying degrees of infectiousness and lethality.

The 2009 'swine flu' outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 became a global pandemic when it infected millions of people and spread to nearly every country.

The virus was thought to have spread from birds and later transmitted to pigs, which served as a 'mixing vessel,' which allowed the infection of humans.

It was widespread, but the symptoms were relatively mild, similar to season flu. Public health officials fears the flu would mutate again and become more virulent, but that never happened.

The mortality rate remained at just 0.002 percent -- killing just two out of 100,000 people infected.

The strain spread to the United States in April 2009 and by May 2010, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over.

A more deadly, and concerning, strain, H5N1, has spread to 15 countries after being transmitted to humans from poultry.

Since 2003, the World Health Organization has discovered 607 cases of the disease in humans, killing 358 people.

In 2012, 29 people have been infected so far and 18 have died.

However, the disease is confined to just 15 countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East and has yet to reach the western world.

So far in 2012, human cases have been isolated to Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam.
