Rail traffic in two directions from Schaffhausen, a town on Switzerland's northern border with Germany, was interrupted and buses were being used instead.

In December a train derailed in the 
Swiss Alps early Sunday when it rammed into mounds of snow from an 
avalanche blocking the tracks.

Only two passengers and two crew 
members were on the train when the accident occurred around 6:00 am 
(0500 GMT), BLS spokeswoman Stephanie Hofer told AFP and no-one was 
injured.
