Andrew Gale has yet to discover what his short-term disciplinary future holds but is already hatching big plans for a new era of Yorkshire success under his captaincy.

Gale is likely to hear during the next two days whether, and if so when, he will face an England and Wales Cricket Board hearing over alleged racial content in his on-field spat with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince.

He has already paid for his conduct that day at Old Trafford earlier this month, serving a mandatory two-match ban which covered Yorkshire's victory over Nottinghamshire when they clinched the County Championship title at Trent Bridge two weeks ago and their 'coronation' final fixture at home to Somerset.

Andrew Gale was prevented from joining Yorkshire's trophy presentation due to the ongoing inquiry

Additionally, and controversially, he was prevented from joining Yorkshire's trophy presentation in Nottingham as it emerged the ECB's inquiry into his altercation with Prince was still ongoing.

Gale, and Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves, were not at liberty to discuss that case during a Q&A session with club members in the Headingley long room at lunch against Somerset on Tuesday.

The half-hour set-piece was an occasionally chaotic occasion, due to a faulty microphone which interrupted Gale and Graves many times.

Both, however, did manage to convey their resolve to be part of a decade of domination of English cricket for Yorkshire.

Yorkshire's captain was accused of using racially offensive language towards Lancashire's Ashwell Prince

More than 300 members packed the venue, and were immediately informed no questions could be answered about 'the current situation with Yorkshire and the ECB'. 

Graves spoke of his pride at having come a 'hell of a long way' with what was a 'club in crisis' when he first began investing in Yorkshire 12 years ago.

Graves, also an ECB vice-chairman, made it clear too - irrespective of the outcome of the disciplinary procedure facing the captain - he has long valued Gale as a pillar of Yorkshire's team.

Recalling why he first decided to become involved at Headingley, Graves said it was 'for people like Andrew Gale - because to me, that is what Yorkshire cricket is all about ...'.

Together, Graves hopes they can help ensure there is no false dawn this time - as there was when Yorkshire last won the title, in 2001.

Colin Graves said Yorkshire's county success 'could be the start of an era, for the next 10 years'

'I believe it could be the start of an era, for the next 10 years,' Graves said.

'That's the target I'm setting, for Yorkshire to dominate - county cricket, one-day cricket.

'I think we've got the coaching staff, the players, the academy ... to achieve that.'

Gale has the same aspirations.

He noticed 'summat special' about Yorkshire even when they first joined up at the start of this season, determined to erase the disappointment of a late fade into runners-up spot the previous summer.

As for that long-term future, Gale added: 'This should just be the start of things for Yorkshire cricket.

'We've got to go on now and win trophies year after year.'
