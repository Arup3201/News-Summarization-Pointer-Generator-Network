In the last 25 years, they have been to the moon and back, defeated an evil robotic dog and have even masterminded a prison escape.

Now Wallace and Gromit are heading to a museum, and it could be one of the last settings for Britain's favourite animated duo.

Never-before-seen drawings penned by creator Nick Park will be put on display in the M Shed in Bristol just days after hinting that he may bring the series to an end.

They chart the Wensleydale-loving man and his dog from their inception in the late 1980s up until the first feature-length film, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit in 2005.

The sketches were penned by animator Nick Park when he first came up with the idea for Wallace and Gromit

The initial idea began with just a plasticine master and his dog, before it developed into one of the most popular comedy franchises in television history

How they are today: The Wallace and Gromit we know and love haven't changed at all from the initial sketches

They include sketches from
when the British animator was in the first stages of developing the idea  - 
which started as a plasticine master and his dog.

The drawings show the dynamic duo in various forms, from scraggly drawings in pencil to more defined versions done in ballpoint pen.

Some show Wallace trapped in a giant mousetrap, paddling on a lifeboat and using a remote controlled iron.

The sketches, which will be unveiled for the first time tomorrow, chart the thinking of Park as he thought up different storylines for the duo.

The show opens just days after Nick Park said he was 'unsure whether to continue' the cartoon franchise because of the ill health of Peter Sallis, 93, the voice of Wallace.

The sketch book includes drawings of Preston, the robotic villain in A Close Shave

The designs, including ideas for inventions, will be displayed at the M Shed in Bristol

Merlin Crossingham, creative director of Wallace and Gromit at Aardman, said he was very excited to be holding an exhibition in the place where the characters were born.

He said: 'This exhibition really does show off Bristol’s creative scene. It’s all about stories that were created here by people living in the city.

'But, as well as an exhibition, it will allow people to step into the story board and hopefully inspire creativity, as there will be opportunities for them to do some drawing.

'All of our ideas began as small doodles, and some of them were brought to life and can be seen here, so it would be great to inspire others to do the same.

'We are so excited to be able to hold this just down the road from where it’s all created: we always have such a warm response from people in Bristol.'

The franchise began on Christmas Day 1989 with A Grand Day Out.

The short film, which was aired on BBC, saw Wallace and Gromit planning a trip for the Bank Holiday, and decide on the moon.

In order to get there, they build a rocket in the basement of their fictional, semi-detached home.

Landing on the lunar surface, they encounter a moving fridge that follows them around during their stay.

A famous line comes when they leave for Earth, with Wallace telling Gromit: 'No crackers Gromit... we've forgotten the crackers.'

The film lasted just 23 minutes, but the characters would grow into mainstays of Christmas television in the UK.

The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse of the Were Rabbit and A Matter of Loaf and Death all followed and were huge successes.

They are constantly repeated when it comes to the festive period.

Throughout the 25 years on air, they have received a huge number of accolades and broke a number of viewing records:

A Grand Day Out - 1989 (was nominated for Best Animated Film at Academy Awards, but lost out to Creature Comforts, which is also a Nick Park creation)

The Wrong Trousers - 1993 (won the Academy Award for Best Short Film)

A Close Shave - 1995 (also won the Academy Award for Best Short Film)

The Curse of the Were Rabbit - 2005 (the first feature length film, lasting 88 minutes)

A Matter of Loaf and Death - 2008 (topped the BBC Christmas Day viewing figures with an average of 14.4million viewers)

Other characters that can be seen include
 one of the slugs from Creature Comforts, Shaun the Sheep, and Preston, 
the robot dog from A Close Shave.

Original sets from The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave will also be on display, as well as props from the hit show.

But
 it’s not just props from the show that are going up for display. 
Visitors will also be able to see the Oscar and Bafta awards that the 
show have won.

Tim Corum, deputy director of Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, said: 'We are so excited to be able to host this event.

One set includes a living room scene where Gromit uses the vacuum while Wallace sits back and relaxes

Merlin Crossingham, Creative Director of Wallace and Gromit, makes some final adjustments to the model of Lady Campanula Tottingham, who featured in The Curse of the Were Rabbit

The set may be one of the last chances to see the models, as the show's creators, Aardman Animations, are considering bringing the story to an end

'It’s something different that we hope everyone will be able to enjoy. The story behind Wallace and Gromit is an inspiring one, with groups of friends coming together to create something so successful, we hope it will inspire more creativity in the city. We know it’s there.'

The display includes some ideas that are yet to be used, including a hover-car, a stretch limo and a scene depicting Wallace and Gromit in a floating bath tube.

Speaking previously Mr Park has said Wallace was inspired by his dad, who loved tinkering in the shed.

Visitors will be allowed to peer into the sets. One is of Gromit measuring his prized marrow from The Curse of the Were Rabbit

The creators said they were 'very excited' that people would be able to see 'where the characters were born'

Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park grew up drawing cartoons and started making films with his mother when he was 13

Nick Park was the creative mind behind one of the most successful stop-motion film projects in history.

He was born in Lancashire (which is why he originally wanted Wallace to have a Lancastrian accent).

He grew up with a keen interest in drawing cartoons and would make films with the help of his mother when he was 13-years-old.

He studied Communication Arts at Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University) and then went to the National Film and Television School, where he started making the first Wallace and Gromit short film, A Grand Day Out.

In 1985, he joined Aardman Animations in Bristol, where he worked as an animator.

One of his first projects was on Peter Gabriel's video for his track, Sledgehammer.

As he worked on the first Wallace and Gromit film, he made Creature Comforts, where zoo animals were matched with the voices of people talking about their home lives.

His first Wallace and Gromit feature, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, was released on 5 October 2005, and won Best Animated Feature Oscar at the Academy Awards, in 2006

On 10 October 2005, a fire gutted Aardman Animations' archive warehouse.

The fire resulted in the loss of most of Park's creations, including the models and sets used in the movie Chicken Run.

Some of the original Wallace & Gromit models and sets, as well as the master prints of the finished films, were elsewhere and survived.
