Footballer Shane Duffy faced criticism online after a tweet sent from his account showed support for the IRA

Everton and Ireland defender Shane Duffy has apologised after support for the IRA was sent from his Twitter account during a St Patrick’s Day booze-up.

The 21-year-old, who switched from playing for Northern Ireland to the Republic in 2010, apologised to his followers on Twitter, claiming that someone else had accessed his account.

The tweet, which was retweeted on Duffy’s account, read: ‘UP THE RA’ and prompted followers to  berate him for supporting the organisation.

The tweet was originally posted accompanied by #COYBIG, which stands for ‘Come on You Boys in Green’.

The defender, who also posted  a picture of two pints of Guinness and a photo of him out celebrating St Patrick’s Day with friends, apologised, saying that it wasn’t  him who retweeted support of  the IRA.

After a barrage of abuse, the under-21 Ireland captain tweeted earlier today: ‘Haha wow this Wernt me!!!!’

He wrote again later, adding: ‘Sorry everyone some little paddy had my phone last night tweets wernt me.. sorry if it offended anyone!! cant leave ur phone anywhere now!!’

Commenting on the amount of abuse he was getting on Twitter following the posting, he wrote: ‘Wow so much hate on something I didn’t do.

'Fair enough gotta take it because its my twitter. And again It was not me who tweeted...And retweeted loads last night! Really am sorry if it offended anyone.. Sorry guys!’

Some of his 49,000 followers, however, didn’t believe him, with one Twitter user saying: ‘Lad, you need to knock this “somebody got my phone” business on the head. It’s making it a million times worse.’

The defender replied: ‘u want me to make a lie up? It’s what happened!!!’

He said that most of the abuse he was getting was from Rangers and Northern Ireland fans, adding: ‘Mostly all rangers and Northern Ireland fans giving me abuse? Give it a rest.’

Shane Duffy posted a series of apologies for the retweet, which said 'UP THE RA' and claimed it was not him who reposted the message

Last night Under-21s manager Noel King said he had no comment to make about the row.

Last May, Sunderland and Ireland winger James McClean quit Twitter after being targeted by online sectarian death threats.

The 23-year-old, from Derry, deleted his Twitter account. At the time a source close to the player added: ‘He has decided to stop using it as a direct result of the abuse and death threats posted. He is unlikely to use it in future.’

He returned to Twitter again, but deleted his account after tweeting that rebel anthem The Broad Black Brimmer by the Wolfe Tones was his favourite song.
