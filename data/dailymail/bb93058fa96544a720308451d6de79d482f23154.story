The owners of a Utah horse ranch are facing more than 100 neglect charges after deputies acting on a tip discovered three horses buried in a shallow grave, several others so malnourished they couldn't stand, and another stuck in a fence and too weak to break free.

Utah County Sheriff's office has arrested Trudy Childs, 59, and her son, Rory Childs, 31, on 101 counts of animal cruelty and 31 counts of livestock at large, Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon said.

Accompanied by a veterinarian, Utah County Sheriff's visited the Smokey Mountain Ranch in Spanish Fork housing about 100 horses last week after getting a report from a neighbor.

Five of the animals have died in recent weeks and about 12 others are ‘skin and bones, at death's doorstep,’ Cannon said. He said Trudy Childs has told them that 12 horses have died recently from starvation.

Utah County Sheriff James Tracy called it one of the largest and most severe cases of animal abuse he has seen in 35 years, according to Desert News.

It's the first arrest for Rory Childs, but his mother has been previously charged with animal cruelty and more than 400 counts of livestock at large, Cannon said. Deputies have had regular contact with what he said has been a problematic ranch.

Trudy Childs has 24 cases pending against her in 4th District Court. She is facing 165 counts of livestock at large, 38 counts of livestock on a highway, 38 counts of maintaining a public nuisance and one count of cruelty to animals.

Rory Childs called the charges false and unfair, and said they'll fight them in court.

‘We've been doing everything we can to keep them fed and get them back healthy,’ Rory Childs said.

He said they're stuck in a legal dispute with a ranch near Ogden owned by Linda Barrow and her son Justin Barrow that was supposed to feed and take care of their horses in a contractual agreement they entered into.

Unimaginable cruelty: Officials said the horses have lost 300-400lbs over the course of several months

They are unable to sell the horses due to the ongoing case. He said the ranch wasn't feeding the horses, and that they got them back last fall in bad shape.

However, Justin Barrows said that the Childs family have not paid them for months, prompting Barrows’ company to file a lawsuit seeking $55,000, the Salt Lake Tribune reported They also put a lien on the horses and intended to sell them to recoup some of the lost income.

Childs said their ranch has been in the business of horse breeding for about 30 years, but they were unable to do their annual sale of baby horses last fall due to the legal dispute.

Without that money, they haven't been able to pay the $1,500 and $2,000 a week to feed all the animals in their charge, Rory Childs said. On their website, the Childs ask for donations to help feed the horses.

Blame game: The Childs family said another ranch was in charge of feeding and caring for the animals, which they had failed to do

But Cannon said the Childs have made no effort to get help or sell the horses.

‘It doesn't matter that they may not have the means to buy the food or the feed for the horses,’ Cannon said. ‘That doesn't absolve them of their responsibility.’

On her Facebook page, Mrs Childs, a mother of four, outlined her ambitions plans for the horse ranch, which included building a large indoor arena with facilities for horse shows, corporate etreats and clinics.

‘We will be seeking investors for a celerbrity re-hab in the near future,’ she wrote.

Her son Rory’s Facebook page also paints an idyllic picture of their operation, with the photo gallery crammed with images of healthy-looking, glossy horses and joyous celebrations held on the ranch. Reality, however, has proven to be different. 

Authorities have been giving the emaciated horses food and water. Cannon said it likely took about six months of consistent malnourishment for the 12 horses near death to get to that state.

According to Utah County Sheriff's deputy Sean Peterson, most of the horses have lost 300-400lbs.It will likely take the same amount of time for them to recover, if they do. Cannon said it is likely that more horses will die.

There was only one source of water for the horses, and they hadn't been drinking from it, Cannon said. The veterinarian said that's likely because the water was dirty or causing them to get sick, he said.

‘We're not saying they weren't fed at all,’ Cannon said, ‘but were not getting fed enough.’

Trudy and Rory Childs are scheduled to be back in court on February 25.

Uncertain future: The horses rescued from the Childses' ranch cared for by the sheriff's office with the help of local residents, but they could potentially be returned to their owners

On Wednesday, law enforcement  officials inspected four different pastures belonging to the Childs in Spanish Fork, Mapleton and Spanish Fork Canyon, where they came upon horses so emaciated that their ribs and bones could be seen nearly breaking through the skin. 

Some of the animals were stuck in barbed wire fences after trying desperately to reach trees on the other side so that they could eat the bark.

One colt between the ages of six and eight months was so weak from starvation that it couldn't stand up.

Cannon said a local veterinarian examined the horses and rated them on a scale from one to nine, with nine being the healthiest. He said all the horses' in the Childses' care were at category one to three.

‘It was sick,’ Peterson told Daily Herald. ’I was born and raised here and have been around horses most of my life. This is the most heartbreaking thing I have ever seen in my whole life.’

The rescued horses are currently being cared for by the sheriff's office with the help of local residents who have been donating feed. Their future, however, remains uncertain at this point.

Cannon said the animals could be taken away from the Childses through civil or criminal cases or they could eventually be returned to them.
