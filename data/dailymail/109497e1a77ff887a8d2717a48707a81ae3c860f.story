The mother of Columbine High School shooter Dylan Klebold is planning a memoir in which she will confront the 'indescribable grief and shame' she has lived with since the 1999 tragedy.

Crown Publishers said on Tuesday that it had acquired a book by Susan Klebold, saying she was compelled to share her story after the murders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and other schools. 

The book is currently untitled and has no release date. Klebold will donate any author profits to mental health research and charitable organizations.

Susan Klebold, pictured in 2003, the mother of Columbine killer Dylan Klebold, is writing a memoir to confront the indescribable grief and shame she feels since her son murdered 13 at his high school in 1999

Dylan Klebold and fellow senior student Eric Harris killed 12 students and one teacher and injured 26 others at the Colorado school before taking their own lives in 1999.  

The large-scale attack also involved a fire bomb used to distract fire fighters. 

At the time, it was the worst school shooting in the country's history before 2012, when shooter Adam Lanza killed 20 students and six teaching staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

Susan Klebold has previously described her feelings in an essay for Oprah Winfrey's O magazine and in interviews for Andrew Solomon's book, Far from the Tree.

Mrs Klebold and her husband Tom Klebold, have spoken little to the press following the Columbine tragedy, The New York Times reported in 2004, but did not move or change their names.  

In her lengthy essay for O Magazine in 2009, Mrs Klebold wrote: 'In the weeks and months that followed the killings, I was nearly insane with sorrow for the suffering my son had caused, and with grief for the child I had lost.'

She continued: 'But while I perceived myself to be a victim of the tragedy, I didn't have the comfort of being perceived that way by most of the community. 

I was widely viewed as a perpetrator or at least an accomplice since I was the person who had raised a 'monster.''

Mrs Klebold also told author Andrew Solomon: 'I can never decide whether it’s worse to think your child was hardwired to be like this and that you couldn’t have done anything, or to think he was a good person and something set this off in him.'

The killers' diaries from the time offered chilling details about their activities in the months before the attack. They had 'to do' lists, with each purchase of gasoline or a weapon marked off, and they had a hit list with at least 42 entries, all of them blacked out.

On a calendar entry for April 20, 1999, the time 11.10 is at the top - an approximate reference to the time the attack began. 

Elsewhere in the calendar are notations including 'get nails' and 'get propane, fill my clips' and 'finish fuses'.

'Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don't want to die, the rest MUST (expletive) DIE!' Harris wrote in a journal entry from October 1998, six months before the attack.

A scrawled entry in Klebold's day planner apparently sketches out April 20, 1999, down to the minute, starting with a 6am meeting, a 10.30am 'set up,' an 11.12am 'gear up' and at 11.16am, 'HAHAHA.'
