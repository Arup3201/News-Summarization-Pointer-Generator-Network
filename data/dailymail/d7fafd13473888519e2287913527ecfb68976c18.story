Police will have to destroy mugshots of innocent people following a landmark case brought by a 15-year-old.

The boy went to court after being told his image would be held until he reached 100 – even though no charges were laid against him.

The High Court ruled yesterday that retaining photographs of suspects who have never been charged was a breach of their human rights.

Police forces will now have to trawl through their records deleting images, including those of people cleared at trial.

The teenager from Peckham, South 
London, was arrested on suspicion of rape in April 2009 but no charges 
were brought when a witness failed to confirm an offence took place.

When he asked to have his details 
removed he was told the mugshot could be retained until he reached the 
age of 100. He was 12 at the time.

Blow: Police argued the powers to keep suspect's pictures on file was vital in the fights against crime. (File picture)

Human rights: The latest High Court judgement means police cannot hold photos, fingerprints and DNA of people who have not committed a crime

The second claimant was a cyclist 
from Chelsea accused of assaulting a police community support officer 
who stopped her riding on a footpath in April 2007.

Police have faced a series of allegations, over recent years, of creating a Big Brother society after obtaining and keeping innocent citizen's private information.

The Met Police were accused of a ‘back-door surveillance scheme’ after it emerged there were harvesting millions of pieces of mobile phone data from people who have never been convicted of any crime.

Officers could also access and copy website histories and email content from smart phones, including records of activity on Facebook and other social networking sites.

The data, will be stored indefinitely, even if the suspect is either released without charge or, when prosecuted, cleared by the courts, police said.

Under the £50,000 scheme, some 16 
terminals designed to harvest the mobile phone data, have been placed in police stations across London and 300 
officers trained to use them.

In 2008, the European Court order police to delete the DNA and fingerprints held on a national database from suspects later cleared of wrongdoing.

The damning verdict, the 17-strong panel said keeping the records 'could not be regarded as necessary in a democracy'.

Before 2001, the police had to destroy DNA samples of individuals acquitted or not charged.

But a rule change has allowed them to keep profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The details of about 4.5million people are held on the database yet one in five - including 40,000 children - had never been charged with an offence.

At the time the Home Office said the register has proved a key intelligence tool in solving 3,500 cases - including high-profile rapes and murders.

The 60-year-old, who was described as
 of good character, had DNA samples, fingerprints and photographs taken 
but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge her with any 
offence. When she complained, the Metropolitan Police refused to delete 
her record.

The force’s policy, which is based on
 the Home Secretary’s code of practice, is to retain mugshots for a 
minimum of six years, although this can be extended indefinitely. 
Scotland Yard argued that it was necessary to keep the photographs to 
prevent crime and disorder.

But Lord Justice Richards said the 
policy drew ‘no adequate distinction’ between those who are convicted 
and those who are either acquitted or not even charged.

The judge, sitting with Mr Justice 
Kenneth Parker, concluded: ‘I am not satisfied that the existing policy 
strikes a fair balance between the competing public and private 
interests and meets the requirements of proportionality.

‘In my judgment, therefore, the 
retention of the claimants’ photographs in application of the existing 
policy amounts to unjustified interference with their right to respect 
for their private life and is in breach of Article 8 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights.’

The judge granted the force a few months to revise their policy.

Home Secretary Theresa May now has two weeks to lodge an appeal on the ruling, which has implications for all police forces.

The courts have already ruled that it is unlawful to keep innocent people’s fingerprints and DNA indefinitely.

But Lord Justice Richards said the 
Met would not have to delete details of the teenage boy’s alleged 
offence from the police national computer.

Yesterday John Wadham, general 
counsel for Equality and Human Rights Commission, which backed the test 
case, said: ‘There is no good reason why the police should hold on to 
information about people who have not committed any crime.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are urgently examining the implications of today’s ruling.’
