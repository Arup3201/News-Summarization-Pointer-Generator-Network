Tiger Woods gave a rare glimpse into his family life as he celebrated his latest tournament win with a giant hug from his four-year-old son Charlie.

In touching scenes, Woods scooped up his young son on the 18th green after cruising to victory at the WGC-Bridgestone in Ohio yesterday.

Following intense media scrutiny after he was accused of cheating on his wife Elin Nordegren in 2009, Woods has been careful to keep his children Charlie and five-year-old daughter Sam out of the public eye.

But four years after the infidelity scandal, Woods's professional and private life are much more stable.

Woods has been dating international skier Lindsey Vonn since March and in recent months the couple were pictured on holiday with his two children.

Yesterday, Woods stormed to victory with a score of -15 and was seven clear of runner up and defending champion Keegan Bradley.

Before he teed off, a relaxed Woods was seen holding Charlie's hand as the pair strolled through the parking lot and, rarely for an international star, there was no security of hangers-on in sight.

After claiming the win, Charlie was carried over to the 18th green for a celebratory hug with his dad.

The youngster was dressed in a red top, to match his father.

Amid cheers and a scrum of photographers, Charlie buried his head in his dad's neck as they walked towards the clubhouse.

Woods's victory strengthened his hold on the top of golf's world rankings.

It was his 79th career win taking him
within three of Sam Snead's all-time record, and took his average point
total from 12.46 to 14.19.

Asked about the US PGA Championship 
at Oak Hill next week, he told CBS: 'I'm really looking forward to it. I
feel like my game is pretty consistent.

'That's one of the things I've 
noticed this year is that I have hit it pretty good most of the year and
weeks I've putted well I've been able to win so it's been pretty good 
so far.'
