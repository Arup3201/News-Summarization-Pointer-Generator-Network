Juventus coach Massimo Allegri has admitted that his prized asset Paul Pogba could be sold as Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid continue to track the midfielder.

The Frenchman starred for the Italian club in a 2-0 victory over Chievo at the weekend and scored a stunner from the edge of the box.

Allegri praised the 21-year-old's performance but admits that he could be sold if the price is right.

He said: 'I think Pogba scored an extraordinary goal and the second goal was an equally extraordinary assist.

'Everything in life has a price, unfortunately. I don't think it is a problem we need to consider right now.

'It is difficult to replace world class players, but it can be done, as football goes on.'

Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid have all been linked with moves for the France international

The 47-year-old believes that the talented Frenchman can only get better.

He added: 'Having said that, Pogba is only 21 years old, has a good 10-15 years ahead of him and more importantly has the qualities to do much better than he is now.

'To win games you need great players, otherwise there wouldn't be players that clubs pay €100m for. As with every profession, there are levels.'

The midfielder was previously at United before moving to Turin. he has been heavily linked with a return and Chelsea are also keen.

Real Madrid are known admirers but the Spanish giants could face a transfer ban the same as Barcelona's as they are investigated for signing two youngsters from Venezuela.
