Phil Jones played as a deep-lying midfielder, but it didn’t feel like a midfielder’s performance.

He was embarrassed by Giorgio Chiellini for their goal, and he was lucky to get away with losing his man at the previous set-piece.

When England were in possession, he didn’t work hard enough to get on the ball — he was happy to let Chris Smalling bring the ball out.

Out of possession, he often flew out in an attempt to deal with the danger. This is fine when he wins the ball, but a very risky tactic. 

In fairness, he dropped back nicely in between the centre halves regularly, which is clearly what he feels comfortable doing. 

The main problem is that he has a habit of chasing the ball when he can’t win it. He looks like he’s been fired out of a cannon! He’ll need to assess situations better and hold his position in front of the back four.

Sir Alex Ferguson famously labelled Jones the next Duncan Edwards, but he didn’t look very Edwards-like. At 23, it feels like we’re still trying to figure out his best position.

He is being asked to play a role that needs to be filled by a more technically-proficient player — like Andrea Pirlo. 

Wayne Rooney looked excellent against Italy, like the elder statesman leading his younger team-mates.

He does everything with intelligence and showed his quality with 30-yard diagonal balls and a fine effort against the crossbar.

England captain showed a good understanding with Harry Kane on their first start together

He also linked up really well with Harry Kane, especially in the second half. It looked like they had a kind of telepathic togetherness.

I’m sure that will be something Roy Hodgson will be keen to see more of in the future.

It’s interesting how, recently, strike partnerships have seemed like a thing of the past, but Rooney and Kane demonstrated they have an excellent understanding and play like a pair, not individuals. 

Jagielka shows why he's still valuable to Roy 

When you look at Phil Jagielka’s rise in international football, it has been completely without fanfare.

He had a couple of hairy moments, but still looked the best defender on show in Turin, weighing in with countless clearances and blocks. He also reads the game very well.

Jagielka fared better than fellow defender Chris Smalling who was forced to withdraw after feeling unwell

He was relegated to the Championship with Sheffield United in 2007 and bought by Everton, where he took a while to mature. 

But right now, he looks better than Smalling and Jones, who have had a lot more hype surrounding their breakthroughs into the England squad. 

Jagielka was left out against Lithuania, but showed he should still be first-choice.
