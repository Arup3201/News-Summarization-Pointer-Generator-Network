Scottish actor David Tennant talked for one minute on the subject of Shakespeare's stage direction, 'Exit, Pursued by a Bear'

David Tennant has become the most successful debut contestant on Radio 4’s quiz show Just a Minute.

He made it through a full 60 seconds without repetition, hesitation or deviation.

The actor talked for one minute on the subject of Shakespeare’s stage direction, ‘Exit, Pursued by a Bear’, without once being interrupted on his very first appearance on the show.

It is believed to be the first time in nearly 50 years of the show that a contestant has made such a fluent debut.

Host Nicholas Parsons congratulated the Doctor Who and Broadchurch star on his performance.

After hearing the effort, which was received with uproarious applause by the Radio 4 audience, the host Mr Parsons said: ‘A newcomer, coming on in this very difficult game, we make it sound easy for the listeners. And it is very difficult.

‘And you have gone on, on your first attempt, speaking for 60 seconds without repetition, hesitation or deviation. Well done… I think you can relax now David.’

The actor replied: ‘Can I leave now before I ruin my record?’

The episode, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 last night, saw him join Stephen Fry, Julian Clary and Paul Merton for the Just a Minute challenge.

Mr Tennant  delighted with his first topic, Shakespeare’s stage direction from The Winter’s Tale ‘Exit, Pursued by a Bear’.

Calling it ‘the most famous direction in theatrical history’, Mr Tennant – who recently appeared on stage in Hamlet – spoke at length about the precise staging of the play.

The long-running quiz show, which began in 1967, sees contestants challenged to speak for one minute ‘without repetition, hesitation or deviation’.

It has played host to the cream of British acting and comic talent over the years.

A spokesman for Radio 4 said the Just a Minute team could not recall any other example of a newcomer making it through a full minute on their first attempt saying it was ‘very possibly’ the only time it had happened.
