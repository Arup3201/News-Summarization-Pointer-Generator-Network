Friends and allies of Baroness Thatcher expressed 'surprise and disappointment' last night as it emerged President Obama is not planning to send any serving member of his administration to her funeral.

Whitehall sources have revealed that the US delegation at tomorrow's service in St Paul's Cathedral will be led by two Reagan era secretaries of state: James Baker and George Shultz.

Though President Obama himself had not been expected to attend, there had been speculation that he would be represented either by Vice President Joe Biden or wife Michelle. However, the Obama administration had said it would not be attending Thatcher's funeral before the Boston bombings

The Queen's decision to attend Lady 
Thatcher's funeral has effectively elevated it to a state occasion 
unprecedented for a political figure in Britain since the death of Sir 
Winston Churchill in 1965.

Other world leaders, including 
Canada's Stephen Harper, Mario Monti of Italy and Polish Prime Minister 
Donald Tusk, are attending the service in person.

A key Reagan-era ally of Baroness Thatcher, former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, will attend

President Obama paid tribute to Lady Thatcher's towering achievements when her death was announced last week.

But a US embassy spokesman confirmed 
that no serving member of his administration would be present to pay 
their last respects, citing a busy week in US domestic politics.

Former US vice president Dick Cheney and ex-secretary of
state Henry Kissinger will attend the funeral, Downing
Street said today.

Former defence secretary Dr Liam Fox, 
Lady Thatcher's closest ally in modern-day politics, said: 'I think it 
would be both surprising and disappointing if after President Obama's 
fulsome tribute to Lady Thatcher, the American administration did not 
send a senior serving member to represent them.'

Sir Gerald Howarth, chairman of the 
Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group of MPs and peers, said: 'The 
bonds forged between the UK and the US through Ronald Reagan and 
Margaret Thatcher was instrumental in ending the Cold War and liberating
 millions of people.

'That the present administration feels
 unable to be represented as the world marks the extraordinary 
contribution Margaret Thatcher made will be a source of disappointment 
to those who served with her in that great endeavour.'

The US embassy insisted no snub was intended, but confirmed that Mr Baker and Mr Schulz would represent the US.

'This is a hugely significant week in terms of US domestic politics,' a spokesman added.

He said that both the First Lady and 
the Vice President were 'the President's point people on gun control', 
adding: 'This is a week when there is a lot of movement on Capitol Hill 
on gun control issues.'

Last night police in London were under pressure to crack down on plans to insult the memory of Lady Thatcher at the funeral.

Hundreds of protesters have pledged to turn their backs as her coffin travels through Central London.

Campaigners said Scotland Yard had 
effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law 
and will not provoke arrests.

The insult is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police.

It will be seen by millions worldwide as the occasion is beamed live around the world on TV.

Police chiefs said they are 'not there
 to uphold respect' and said demonstrators who are merely 'insulting' 
are unlikely to face arrest. But they faced a backlash from many who 
questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead 
stateswoman.

Hundreds have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege.

They want to occupy high- profile points of Lady Thatcher's three-mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed.

John Cooper QC, the architect behind 
the back-turning protest, said the public nature of the funeral means it
 is impossible to ban insulting gestures.

He said: 'Simply saying it is beastly,
 horrible or distasteful – a point of view that I can understand – does 
not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that 
rightly wants to legally demonstrate.'

Retired chief constable Dr Tim Brain 
said police are forced to tread the line between the right to protest 
and upholding the law.

He said on BBC Radio 4 that police 
will be 'very firm' if protest becomes disruption, for example if 
objects are thrown at the funeral procession.

Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit 
described protesters as 'mindless bigots' but said police cannot 
intervene if they obey the law.

She was always so particular about detail, passionate about getting things right.

So in the semi-darkness of pre-dawn 
London yesterday, through virtually deserted streets, they counted the 
exact number of steps it will take to carry Baroness Thatcher to her 
funeral service, and timed her journey to the second.

In a full and detailed rehearsal, each
 man, woman and horse involved in the last stage of the procession 
enacted the role they will play tomorrow.

It created the bizarre but often 
stirring spectacle of military marching bands playing to no one, 
bearskin guardsmen with no crowds to flank – even a minister saying a 
prayer over an empty coffin.

This was the last chance any of them 
had to practise for the real thing – the largest funeral in Britain 
since that of the Queen Mother in 2002.

Ceremony: The funeral will be the biggest Britain has seen in many years, costing around £10million

The coffin is taken up the steps of the cathedral at dawn as the services want no mistakes on Wednesday

Journey: The coffin is show here on the gun carriage as it heads towards St Paul's

Sombre: This is the path the flag draped coffin of Margaret Thatcher will follow later this week

Salute: Lady Thatcher's coffin will be carried on a gun carriage though the City of London to St Paul's cathedral where a funeral service will be held on April 17

Beneath grey skies, and then into the 
sunrise, a ten-strong bearer party carried and escorted a flag-draped, 
weighted coffin from St Clement Danes, the RAF church on The Strand.

Tomorrow this is where the coffin 
bearing Lady Thatcher will be transferred to a horse-drawn gun carriage 
after its journey by hearse from Westminster. From here, along Fleet 
Street and across Ludgate Circus, it will be taken to St Paul's 
Cathedral for the funeral service.

In a salute to Lady Thatcher's 
celebrated legacy, the pall-bearers were selected from soldiers, sailors
 and airmen closely associated with the Falklands war.

A single bell tolled as they set off 
for St Paul's. They then moved along the route to the strains of Chopin,
 Beethoven and Mendelssohn funeral marches. On the day, thousands are 
expected to line the streets.

Pressure: More than 700 members of the services will take part in the funeral procession

Pomp: The honour guard from the three military services, from regiments linked to the Falklands War, carry the coffin

Funeral: The coffin will be taken from St Clement Danes Church, pictured this morning, to St Paul's, by gun carriage

Waiting: Lady Thatcher's coffin is shown here on the aisle of St Clement Danes Church

Yesterday only a scattering of 
early-morning spectators got a preview of the event, involving nearly 
800 servicemen and women.

The rehearsal finished before most commuters had even begun their journey.

In the interests of military 
precision, a final calculation confirmed that the procession would have 
to walk at 70 steps a minute over a journey of some 1,200 yards, as well
 as allowing time for choreographed pauses. It was clearly a useful 
fine-tuning exercise – the coffin is reported to have arrived three 
minutes and 15 seconds over schedule.

Major Andrew Chatburn, who has the job
 of organising it all, said the rehearsal was vital to allow those 
taking part 'to get a feel for how it's going to go so they can perform 
their duties with confidence on the day'. And, of course, to do Lady 
Thatcher proud.

Poised: As the coffin heads towards St Paul's, men and women wait outside the cathedral for the procession to reach them
