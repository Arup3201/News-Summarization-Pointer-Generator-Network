A&E units will not cope with the surge in patients this winter unless bosses make urgent changes, MPs have warned.

Just one in six casualty units has enough consultants working during its busiest hours and most are ‘relying too heavily’ on junior doctors.

A report published today warns of an impending ‘crisis’ as more than 100,000 patients now spend at least four hours in A&E every month.

A&E: MPs are warning that NHS bosses must quickly draw up plans on how they will cope with the expected rise in patients this winter

It says the launch of the NHS 111 helpline made problems worse as unqualified call centre workers sent patients unnecessarily to casualty.

MPs on the health select committee say NHS bosses must quickly draw up plans on how they will cope with the expected rise in patients this winter.

Their report revealed how consultants may be absent for the 16 busiest hours of the day – between 8am and midnight – in 83 per cent of casualty departments.

But to cover gaps in rotas, trusts are spending about £500,000 a year on locum doctors who tend not to be as skilled, it said. Junior doctors do 12-hour shifts without breaks and many work seven nights in a row ‘under intense pressure’, it added.

The report comes as the number of emergency cases is soaring. A lack of GP out-of-hours services has been blamed for patients increasingly arriving at A&Es with non-urgent problems.

And Britain’s ageing population has led to rising numbers of elderly people being admitted for long-term treatment.

Winter this year was particularly busy, with many staff reporting departments at breaking point as they dealt with cases of flu, chest infections and the vomiting bug norovirus.

Although summer is usually quieter, the 
heatwave has triggered a surge of patients suffering from sunstroke, 
heart problems and allergies.

Dr Cliff Mann, of the College of Emergency Medicine, warned that staffing levels ‘had come to a crisis’. He claimed the methods used to plug rota gaps were ‘untenable and unsustainable’.

Tory MP Stephen Dorrell, chairman of the health select committee, said: ‘The system is “flying blind” without adequate information about the nature of the demand being placed upon it. The committee is mindful of pressures which will build during next winter and is concerned that current plans lack sufficient urgency.’

He said he was ‘not convinced’ that the plans so far presented to him by NHS chiefs, senior GPs and ambulance bosses were ‘adequate’.

Britain's ageing population means rising numbers of elderly people inevitably require treatment

He added: ‘We think it is extraordinary that consultant coverage for a minimum of 16 hours a day during the working week is guaranteed in only 17 per cent of designated A&E departments. The figure is even lower at weekends and there are high vacancy rates for senior staff and consultants leading, inevitably, to high locum costs.

‘We know that early assessment by a senior clinician can improve outcomes and accelerate a patient’s progress through hospital, but for this to happen there must be sufficient numbers of senior staff in the emergency department.’

MPs also said the NHS 111 helpline was in the ‘last chance saloon’, although they claimed it has the potential to work.

Hospital watchdog Monitor says £500million should be spent recruiting 10,000 extra staff including 1,100 consultants, 1,300 junior doctors and 4,000 nurses and midwives.

Dame Barbara Hakin, the chief operating officer of NHS England, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's very disappointing that accident and emergency departments don't have as much consultant cover as we would all wish them to have.

'We need to work much harder at making this an attractive profession for young doctors, so we can recruit them.

'Inevitably if you have a situation where you don't have the best possible resource, then that can compromise making sure patients get the best treatment.

'We need to do two things about this. First and foremost, we need to look at how we can make our accident and emergency departments the very best they can be, which means improving recruitment.

'But also, we need to make sure that the patients who don't need to be there and don't want to be there aren't. That's about tackling issues in general practice, in community services and in social care which will help to keep the patients that we are most concerned about - the vulnerable and the elderly - in their own homes.'

Dame Barbara agreed there were 'difficulties' with the roll-out of the 111 service, adding: 'If certain providers had done what they said that they were going to do and had the call handlers in place to talk to patients, then it would have been fine. That didn't happen.

'But we were able within a very few weeks to get a really great service, and the 111 service is now stable.'
