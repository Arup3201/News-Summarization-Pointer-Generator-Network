London Mayor Boris Johnson is interested in taking over the capital’s Blue Plaque scheme, a week after The Mail on Sunday revealed its future was at risk.

Mr Johnson, right, has asked his officials to investigate ‘the costs and practicalities’ of running the London scheme, which has so far placed more than 850 plaques on properties across the capital.

Senior figures within the Mayor’s Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport believe the idea ‘makes sense’ and are looking at ways he could take over the scheme from English Heritage.

One senior Government source said: ‘Other local councils run their own versions and there’s no reason why the Mayor can’t be responsible  for the London version.

‘They could probably do it a lot more efficiently than English Heritage for a fraction of the cost.’

English Heritage, which took over responsibility for the Blue Plaques in 1986, says the future of the scheme is ‘uncertain’ because it can no longer afford the £250,000 annual cost.

The plaques cost an average of £965 to install at a time when English Heritage’s budget is dropping from £130 million to £92 million.

Plaques that have already been approved are still expected to be installed by a team reduced to two full-time employees.

A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office last night said that  Mr Johnson had asked for details about the running of the scheme but insisted he had made  no further decisions.

Meanwhile, the National Trust last night dismissed reports it was willing to step in and save the scheme.
