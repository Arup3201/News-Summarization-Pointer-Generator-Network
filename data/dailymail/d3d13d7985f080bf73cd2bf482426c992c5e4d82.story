There is still time for more to come but with knowing nods to Diego Costa (Chelsea), Rio Ferdinand, Mauricio Isla (both QPR), Fraser Forster (Southampton) and Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal), these are my top five signings made by Premier League clubs so far this summer.

5) Romelu Lukaku - Everton

Everything about this signing sings of a new era for Everton Football Club. Soon after paying the wages to keep Gareth Barry, Bill Kenwright has again answered his critics among the Goodison faithful by laying out some serious cash by way of £28million for Lukaku.

If Roberto Martinez is as good as his many fans believe he is then he can only deliver improvement for Everton this season. He is the first manager at the club in many years who can’t say the board didn’t fully back him.

So it’s a massive statement from Kenwright, Martinez and all at Everton. But it will be meaningless unless they make the break into the top four and/or win a trophy. Just like when Lukaku gets in front of goal, there needs to be an end product for Everton after spending so much. You’ve got to admire Martinez for putting so much pressure on himself.

Knows where the net is: The young Belgian impressed hugely while on loan at Goodison Park last year 

4) Enner Valencia - West Ham

Some might look at this signing and think it’s a knee-jerk reaction to a player having a good World Cup with Ecuador, but Valencia’s ability was talked about widely before the tournament got underway.

If West Ham’s much talked about commitment to a new attacking style is for real, then the forward should flourish.

I’ve seen him score with his left, his right and his head. He can bag a set-piece goal too, and he’s dynamic in the box.

It’s a shame for the Hammers that he will miss the start of the season with injury, but one of the key issues to any potential success could be whether he adapts to the Premier League.

3) Cesc Fabregas - Chelsea

How do you replace Frank Lampard? It could have been a massive issue for Chelsea as they said goodbye to their record scorer - one of their best players in an incredible 10 years of success at the club – and, along with John Terry, a huge talisman at Stamford Bridge.

But Jose Mourinho dealt with it superbly by bringing in Fabregas. If it’s true that Arsenal chose not to sign their former captain then that’s bizarre, especially as they have allowed potential rivals Chelsea take him.

He’s a goalscorer and a creator, and he’s proven in the Premier League and in Europe. You can’t ask for much more.

2) Calum Chambers – Arsenal

Pound for pound over the long term this could be a brilliant signing. Arsenal could get 15 years or more out of Chambers – it could prove to be a bargain.

But don’t be fooled into thinking Arsene Wenger is a genius who could see Chambers as a centre half when nobody else could. It was former England Under 19 coach Noel Blake who picked Chambers at the heart of the back four for a game against Turkey earlier this year and he was excellent.

Sadly the FA have seen fit to dispense with that kind of coaching bravery and Blake is now helping Jose Riga achieve mission impossible at Blackpool.

But England may benefit from Wenger’s bravery. Slotting the teenager in at centre half at Wembley for his debut is bold, but Chambers was excellent, and he could solve a problem for the national team in a position where Roy Hodgson needs help.

Talent: The Ecuador forward was one of the standout performers at the World Cup in Brazil

That'll do nicely! Chelsea were aware that they needed someone to replace Manchester City's Frank Lampard

1) Bojan Krkic – Stoke City

It’s down to the player himself but this has the potential to be one of the best signings in Stoke’s history. When he burst on to the scene at Barcelona, Bojan was brilliant.

Make no mistake, he had all it takes to be as good as Lionel Messi. But he didn’t continue the progress as many expected, and he’s now hoping to be the new Crouchy, rather than the new Messi.

He was on the bench for the Champions League final three years ago, but when Ibrahim Afellay was rewarded with a late substitute appearance, Bojan felt he could not continue playing under Pep Guardiola - he felt he couldn’t even speak to the manager any longer, and so he moved on.

Power: The ex-Barcelona forward was lauded by Pep Guardiola but had to move on from the Nou Camp 

At his best Guardiola had said Bojan was one of the few players who had a ‘magical touch’, and before that Pep’s predecessor with the Catalan giants, Frank Rijkaard, called him ‘a treasure.’

After picking up Marko Arnautovic last summer, and now signing Bojan, those who doubted Stoke’s commitment to a change of style under Mark Hughes need doubt no longer. The commitment is there, so let’s see what it brings on the pitch next season.

Bojan is 24 this month – he’s still relatively young. If he can recapture the form he was showing at the Nou Camp as a teenager, then it could be brilliant for all at the Britannia Stadium.

One thing is for certain, we are about to find out if he can do it when it’s wet and windy in Stoke.

Missing man: Arsenal's new striker Alexis Sanchez doesn't make the top five despite his pedigree
