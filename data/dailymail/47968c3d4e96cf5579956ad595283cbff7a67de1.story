It is one of the defining images of Christmas, as children cosy up to Santa on his knee to tell him exactly what presents they want.

But in an age of 'government guidance' and overcautious school bosses, it was only a matter of time before it became a tradition of the past.

A rising number of schools are now forbidding children from sitting on Santa's knee, with increasing numbers of teachers banning any physically contact with Santa at all.

Thing of the past: The scene of children sitting on Santa's knee could be over after government guidance suggested there should be no physical contact between Father Christmas and children.

With those playing 'Santa' no longer required to pass a CRB check, more and more schools are opting to 'err' on the side of caution and impose strict rules on children visiting Father Christmas.

Parents who volunteer for the role of Santa don't have to undergo CRB checks as they do not come into regular contact with children.

But those who want to don the red suit and big festive white beard can now only do in many schools as long as they are not left alone with the children and don't let them sit on their laps.

Government guidance now states: 'Under no circumstances must a volunteer who has not obtained a CRB disclosure... be left unsupervised with children.'

Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the Daily Telegraph this ruling meant many members had decided it is better if Santa avoided all physical contact with children.

He said: 'The climate we work in, and the risk of getting it wrong, mean many school leaders err on the side of cuation.

'And if you are going to 'err' on the side of caution, that's the side most parents would prefer.'

A spokesman for the Department for Education said children could still sit on Father Christmasâ€™s knee as long as parents were consulted and were 'completely comfortable' with the situation.

Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, told the Telegraph: 'It would be a great shame if misinterpretation of regulations deterred schools from traditional festive celebrations.'
