Schools are resorting to having kitchen ‘pods’ dropped in by crane as the fiasco surrounding Nick Clegg’s free meals pledge deepens.

More than 1,700 primaries have no cooking facilities, it emerged – as research revealed just how ill-equipped they are to meet the promise to four to seven-year-olds from September.

Some plan to hire or buy self-contained mini-kitchenettes which can be lowered into the playground, as they have no permanent kitchen.

KitchenPods, fully self-contained kitchens that can be delivered to schools and can be up and running within a matter of hours

Others will be forced to provide cold packed lunches to be eaten at classroom desks.

Figures compiled by the BBC found that 1,749 schools have no kitchen at all. Many more need improvements to their kitchens before they can deliver the promise.

The research emerged as a former adviser to Education Secretary Michael Gove said that the Liberal Democrats gave his department ‘just a few hours’ notice of the £1billion policy.

Henry de Zoete said the sudden announcement at last year’s Lib Dem conference meant the ‘hard graft’ needed to develop the details of the policy could not be done.

This had led to problems with implementation and ‘changes in position’, he said.

The developments came as headteachers questioned the ‘ethics’ of handing free meals to well-off children rather than targeting those who are judged most in need.

Leading children's food expert and No.1 parenting author, Annabel Karmel MBE, has given traditional school food a radical overhaul, with new child-approved  menus for schools that will be launched this coming September

Ministers have launched a range of initiatives aimed at helping schools meet the September deadline to deliver  the policy.

These include setting up a ‘small schools taskforce’ – a coalition of caterers, kitchen designers and others – to assist those with less than 150 pupils.

It is preparing to launch a pilot next term, which will involve providing up to 30 schools with kitchen pods – small kitchenettes that can handle up to 80 meals.

They cost between £26,000 and £38,000 to buy or about £10,000 a year to hire.

Schools can order bespoke pods based on their pupil numbers and existing equipment.

Annabel Karmel, the chef and author, has designed a range of menus that can be easily prepared in the pods, including familiar dishes such as spaghetti bolognese.

Under Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg’s policy, schools will be required by law to provide a nutritious meal – whether it is hot or cold.

One headteacher yesterday  told how he could not afford the staff needed to supervise pupils at lunchtime.

Despite a call, and subsequent promise for free school meals, more than 1,700 primary schools have no cooking facilities and are too ill-equipped to meet the pledge

Duncan Churchill, of Mudeford Infants in Dorset, told the BBC’s Daily Politics show: ‘We are talking about children as young as four walking round with trays of food. They need supervision and that costs money.’

Mr Churchill said the free packed lunches already delivered to eligible pupils by outside caterers were ‘the sort of stuff you get on a train, where it’s been left to sweat’.

He questioned whether spending tens of thousands on giving free meals to pupils in ‘leafy Dorset’ was the best use of  the funds.

Pete Mountstephen, chairman of the National Primary Heads group, raised ‘ethical issues’ with the policy.

Mr Mountstephen, who is also head of St Stephen’s CofE Primary in Bath, said some families could easily afford to spend £400 a year on packed lunches, cash that could be better spent on those in real need.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘Schools are receiving a huge amount of support to provide free school meals.

‘We are providing £150million to improve kitchens and dining facilities, as well as £22.5million specifically to help smaller schools to provide these meals.’
