Pretty in a navy and blue lace dress and with her glossy red hair swinging around her shoulders, Princess Beatrice was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a charity dinner in London last night.

With her was her mother, Sarah Ferguson, who showed off her newly slimline figure in a tailored black suit and matching cashmere top.

The pair were attending the Bell Pottinger Charity Dinner at Lancaster House, a vast Georgian palace now owned and run by the Foreign Office.

Once known as York House, the imposing building was once owned by another Duke of York, Prince Frederick, the second son of George III.

The supper, which was held to raise funds for Northwood African Education Foundation, which aims to raise funds for schools in Azezo area of Gondar in north-western Ethiopia.

Princess Beatrice, 26, is the patron of the charity and in her profile on its website, expands on her love of Africa and her passion for good causes.

The event, which also included an auction, saw singers Jamelia and Lucy Kay lend their support to the cause, with Ms Kay later performing.

But despite their best efforts, all eyes were on the royals and Fergie in particular - thanks in no small part to her svelte new look.

The erstwhile Duchess of York has long battled with her weight and has spoken openly of her battle to shed the pounds.

Now fit and healthy, the Duchess has had more good news in recent weeks after it was revealed that the Queen allowed her to hold a charity gala at Windsor Castle - a sign, say royal watchers, of a return to the royal fold.

While the Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law, Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship.

Close: Although divorced, Prince Andrew and his former wife remain close and still live together

Friends: The Duke of Edinburgh is said to be 'baffled' by their enduringly close relationship 

The couple, who still live together, separated in 1992 but remain on good terms and brought up their daughters together.

It has been claimed that Prince Philip has never forgiven the Duchess for the embarrassment she caused the Royal Family during the 90s - during which time she embarked on an affair with a Texan oil tycoon while pregnant with her second child and was photographed ­having her toes sucked by her 'financial adviser'.

Thrown with the help of her former husband, the event, which took place close to her 55th birthday, was for the benefit of Children in Crisis.
