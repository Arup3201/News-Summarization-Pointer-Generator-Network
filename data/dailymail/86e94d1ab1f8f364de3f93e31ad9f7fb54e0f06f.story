Is crack-smoking Rob Ford actually in rehab?

That is the question troubling Toronto after their embattled mayor decided to break his silence one week after taking a leave of absence to deal with alcohol and drug addiction.

Despite declaring rehab to be 'amazing', citizens of Canada's largest city are dubious their mayor is where he says he is, with sightings of Ford around town reaching fevered level as members of the public upload pictures to Twitter.

Indeed, by speaking to the media Ford has inadvertently fanned the flames of speculation as to his whereabouts, especially after the confusion surrounding his flight to Chicago.

Reports suggested that Ford did fly to the United States to seek rehab as expected, but instead returned to Canada after withdrawing his application, after which the media lost track of the drug-addled mayor.

And his apparent upbeat demeanor in Wednesday's interview, in which he compared rehab to his childhood football camp, just days after hitting rock bottom as sparked huge rumors on social media that he is not telling the truth.

The very fact he is giving media interviews and claims to be calling constituents has caused many to doubt his claims of treatment, considering the strict conditions of entry imposed by many rehabilitation facilities.

These usually include the removal of cell phones and for a period all contact with the outside world.

His refusal to give up his location too has led to doubt that he seeking help for his problems and ridicule online.

'Sounds like Ford is having an awesome time in rehab. Which (sic) exactly how I imagined week 1 of battling a serious alcohol addiction would be,' wrote one commenter to Twitter on Wednesday.

However, Ford's brother, Doug, has refuted all claims the mayor is not in rehab.

He told reporters on Tuesday that Rob Ford is 'in rehab facility, 100 percent,' but would not divulge where out of respect for the other patients.

However, Doug Ford was also quoted by reporters as having said his brother is in a 'rehabilitation program.'

Doug Ford told reporters his brother is not in any kind of out-patient program.

Furthermore, Doug Ford claims he received a phone call from his brother's doctor on  Wednesday asking the media to calm down.

However, while it is evident the media do not know where Rob Ford is, it is not clear what they are supposed to be backing off from.

'This is not about just Rob, this is about all the other patients. You can't put their jeopardy at stake here of their recovery,' said Doug Ford at Toronto's city hall on Wednesday.

The frenzy about Ford's whereabouts hit new levels earlier this week when a young woman updated Twitter on Tuesday that she had seen the mayor at a Tim Horton's in Toronto's west end.

She told CP24 on Wednesday she is adamant it was Rob Ford and that he changed his clothes in the coffee shop bathroom,

'When he went into the store he was wearing a black suit but when he came out he was wearing a grey, track suit,' she said.

Two Tim Horton's workers also told CBC News they saw him.

Again, rushing to his brother's aid, Doug Ford told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that it was actually him at the Tim Hortons and not Rob Ford.

'That was me at the Junction. That was me that pulled over,' said Councillor Ford at city hall Wednesday.

'I was taking pictures and handing out T-shirts. That was me on my way down here. So, please, do your due diligence.'

Adding to the speculation as to Rob Ford's whereabouts was Aaron Spivak, a hockey player who tweeted he saw the mayor in Richmond Hill and uploaded a picture.

Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, a Ford family ally said that Toronto deserves to know where its mayor is.

'I would say to you right now that at the very least the city should know the city that he's in for treatment, and with some verification that he is in fact being treated,' he said.

Speaking from his undisclosed location, Ford said that there's no timeline for his return to office, but Ford has assured his supporters he'll be back in time to gain re-election later this year.

'Of course, I am coming back and I am going to kick butt,' he told the newspaper.

'I will be on the ballot for mayor in October, guaranteed, and I will do well.'

He joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.'

Ford said the rehab center treats 'addictions to alcohol and other things' and is 'worth every penny.'

After a week of being clean and sober, the mayor said he's starting to come to terms with what has happened over the past year but he said he is hopeful he can right his wrongs.

'At first, I was mad. I was mad at myself and saying, "Why me?"' he told the Sun. 'But then I realized it could have been a whole lot worse.'

He said the very public fall from grace was possibly what he needed to shake him into action.

'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better.'

Ford refused to reveal the name of the treatment center he's checked into, out of respect for the other patients, and he wouldn't even confirm it was in Canada.

He said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city pub. He said he woke up and 'I told Dougie, 'I am going away' and then started looking up rehab and treatment centers.'

Ford told the Sun his family knows where he is and he's been speaking to his children regularly, though they don't know why he's getting help.

He said the past week has been tough but he described going into rehab as the 'best decision' he has ever made and said he wishes he'd done it sooner.

'I said to myself, "Am I going to try to cover it up for the rest of your life or deal with it and go to professional help?"' Ford recalled. 'I decided to get help.'

Ford's lawyer said last week that the mayor had left Toronto for rehab after a video surfaced that appeared to show him smoking a crack pipe late last month — nearly a year after reports of an initial video that appeared show him smoking the drug.

The last time Ford visited the United States was in early March, when he appeared on the "Jimmy Kimmel Live" television show in Los Angeles.

'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes,' Doug Ford told the AP. 'As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob.'

Doug Ford said he has spoken with his brother since he entered the program and that he is doing well.

'He's feeling great actually. He's feeling good. He's bought into the program and he's getting the support he needs,' Doug Ford said.

City councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong said Doug Ford spoke to Rob again on Tuesday and the mayor was on the phone when Doug passed the phone to him. Minnan-Wong said the mayor is in 'good spirits' and is 'working out.'

'He told me he was in rehab,' Minnan-Wong said. 'I think Rob misses council and he would like to be here.'

Shelley Carroll, a Toronto city councilor, said Ford's location should be made public. 'I'm not buying that it can't be divulged,' Carroll said.

Councilor Giorgio Mammoliti said the mayor should provide a doctor's note.
