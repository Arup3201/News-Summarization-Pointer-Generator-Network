A benefits cheat who claimed £24,000 in disability payments while opening the batting for his village cricket team is set to lose his home after being ordered to repay the money he scammed from the system.

Stewart Lorains, who was also the team’s wicket keeper, scored 614 runs in 41 games between 2009 and 2012 after telling benefits authorities he was constantly in pain, slow at walking, and needed daily assistance with washing, going to the toilet and dressing.

The 54-year-old was continuing to claim Disability Living Allowance when investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions observed and secretly filmed him turning out for Boosbeck cricket team, in North Yorkshire.

Benefits cheat Stewart Lorains claimed thousands in disability payments while playing for his local cricket team

Lorains told benefits bosses he was in 'constant pain' and needed help washing and dressing while at the same time racking up more 600 runs for the Boosbeck team in North Yorkshire

After authorities launched a bid to claw back the cash yesterday, prosecutor Martin Towers told Teesside Crown Court that Lorains benefited from his crime to the tune of £24,505.

The court heard there was £16,209 available from his existing assets which could be returned to the state.

Mr Towers said that the house Lorains shares with his wife in St Cuthbert’s Walk, Saltburn, east Cleveland, was valued at £74,500, and the outstanding mortgage repayments on it were £42,081 in total.

Lorains' 
lawyer, Tamara Pawson, told Judge Peter Bowers that he would 
now have to sell the house, adding: 'It is his only main asset.'

Lorains described cricket as 'my life and soul' and also worked as a boxing coach

Lorains pleaded guilty to failing to notify a change of circumstances at an earlier hearing last year.

The cricket-lover - who had been described as an 'active sportsman' and 'upstanding member of the community' before the scam -  was given a four-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months.

He had begun claiming benefit in November 2008 for arthritis, diabetes and asthma, but by May 2009 his condition had improved.

Lorains - who described cricket as 'my life and soul' and who according to the Boosbeck club website had a batting average of 18 - was also a boxing coach and football referee, Miss Pawson told an earlier hearing.
