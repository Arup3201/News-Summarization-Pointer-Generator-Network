As the clock ticks down on Alexis Sanchez’s time with Barcelona, the duel to secure his signature increasingly appears to be a straight foot-race between Liverpool and Arsenal to sign up the electric Chilean forward.

After a glittering performance at the World Cup in Brazil, Sanchez holds all the cards as he deliberates over his future.

Here, Sportsmail assesses all that he needs to know ahead of making the life-changing decision. From the stadium and training-ground, to the managers and the supporters, we cast our judgement over which club is bigger: Arsenal or Liverpool?

Come and get me! It now looks inevitable that Chile star Alexis Sanchez will leave Barcelona this summer and Arsenal and Liverpool are the two favourites to pounce

STADIUM

Arsenal may have the more futuristic home these days but most observers would accept Anfield remains the most febrile stadium in English football, reserving that unrivalled din for the special occasions, even if it is not what it once was on a weekly basis.

The sign in the tunnel tells the players ‘This Is Anfield’ but on those special European nights, they need no reminder, as the pillars and rafters of this famous stadium shake and the songs, chants and banners cascade down from all sides.

Long overdue development plans are set to take place in the near future to expand the stadium towards a 60,000 all-seater capacity. In the corporate complex that is the Emirates Stadium, you can often be left feeling impressed by the infrastructure but cold by the atmosphere and it may continue to be that way as long as prices remain high, altering the demographic and cutting off the supply to the every-day football fan.

SHOT US YOUR POTS

 Arsenal’s domestic and continental success may be impressive but pales in comparison to the might of Merseyside, with Liverpool boasting 18 leagues titles to Arsenal’s 13 and five European Cup’s to Arsenal’s one Cup Winners’ Cup and one Fairs Cup.

Arsenal may have won more FA Cups, but for heritage and global reputation, Liverpool, whose European trophy haul surpasses Ajax and Barcelona, are only matched by Manchester United in English football.

MANAGER

Despite the nine-year trophy drought, Arsene Wenger retains an aura that will attract talent to the Emirates Stadium.

Arsenal may have fallen behind their rivals but they maintained the aesthetic beauty that so characterised the performances of Wenger’s finest teams and this is recognised on the continent.

Footballers know that they will invariably improve under the parental qualities of Wenger, who has three Premier League titles and FA Cups on his CV in English football.

In Brendan Rodgers, however, Wenger has competition. The Northern Irishman has emerged as one of Europe’s brightest minds, working under Jose Mourinho, and altering the landscape of British football by transporting Catalonia into South Wales at Swansea before restoring Liverpool into a title-challenging force with tactical intelligence and motivational methods.

This summer, as Rodgers is tasking with rebuilding his squad as Luis Suarez heads out of the exit door, will go some way to indicating the strength of his powers of persuasion, with high-end stars a necessity to replace the troublesome Uruguayan.

Rising star: Brendan Rodgers has all the attributes to be a successful manager, as shown by Liverpool's tilt at the Premier League title last season

GLOBAL FAN BASE

The Arsenal Twitter feed has just under 4million followers, compared to Liverpool attracting just 2.86m.

Evidently, Arsenal’s global reach has been amplified by success in the 1990’s and the early part of the 2000’s, during the explosion of globalisation as the North London club tapped into the commercial opportunities available.

Liverpool remain a huge attraction, particularly in the Middle East and Malaysia but Arsene Wenger’s Invincibles captured the imagination in the Far East, and the club eclipsed Manchester United as the most popular in China, according to surveys earlier this year.

Arsenal’s domestic support may not compare to Liverpool’s more visceral, passionate following but the commercial incentives available to Sanchez may be greater if he is to be based in London.

TRAINING GROUND

As with all elite clubs these days, both Liverpool and Arsenal boast immaculate, top-of-the-range facilities, from gymnasiums and specifically designed synthetic pitches to swimming pools and high-end rehabilitation rooms.

While Liverpool’s training base has been there since the days of Bill Shankly, Arsenal’s was only developed in the late 1990’s, on the specific request of Wenger, who was determined to elevate standards at Arsenal.

Partially funded by the proceeds of Nicolas Anelka’s transfer to Real Madrid, Arsenal invested millions in a brand new plush training centre at London Colney, even being used by the England national team on several occasions.

CHANCE OF SUCCESS

Liverpool are without a league title for 24 years, since the days when it was simply called Division One before the Premier League swept into town.

Arsenal had gone nine years without a single trophy before their FA Cup success in May. The odds of silverware do not seem too favourable at either destination but both these clubs may feel that the last campaign could act as a kick-start for something special to take place.

Nonetheless, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea all strengthening in the transfer market, it would represent a major surprise if either Liverpool or Arsenal emerged as title winners next season, while European success would appear to be some way off for both sides.
