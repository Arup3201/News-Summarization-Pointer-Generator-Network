I’m ready for the challenge, so I’ve officially applied for the job. I want to be the next manager of Peterborough United.

But Darren Ferguson’s sacking at the ABAX Stadium at the weekend shows how incredibly difficult it is to make it in football management in this country.

Less than a year after winning a trophy at Wembley, with three promotions under his belt, Ferguson was axed.

He’s had to sell top players, but still sustain a challenge in those circumstances. This season results have been terrible since October, but three of his key signings – Jon Taylor, Marcus Maddison and Jack Baldwin – have been injured for large chunks of the campaign.

Peterborough is not a football hotbed. Attendances at London Road, the home of Peterborough United, are awful. Under 6,000 was the average last season, and in the Championship the previous season it was just over 8,200.

That income isn’t enough so Posh have to make their own money by signing players on the cheap, and selling them for big profit. If this is successful, the policy works, and the club flourishes.

Ferguson’s sacking is unfathomable when you put it into the wider context, when you take time to look beyond a run of shocking results since October, and indeed examine the reasons behind that poor form. His success at making players better, making them worth large sums of money, helping them develop the talent and mentality to play for bigger clubs at a higher level, has proved his undoing.

In the last 24 months Ferguson has lost players like George Boyd, Dwight Gayle, Lee Tomlin, Tommy Rowe, Mark Little, Craig Alcock and Britt Assombalonga. That lists includes two captains, well over 100 goals, and several promotions.

Boyd is the classic example: he produced his best-ever performance for Posh at Millwall in a 5-1 win in February 2013. A few days later he joined Hull City and Posh were relegated.

Tomlin scored a hat-trick as Posh completely outplayed Reading in a 6-0 win in August 2013. Four days later, he refused to play for the club in a home defeat by Crawley and demanded they let him leave. He eventually joined Middlesbrough the following January. Posh flopped in the play-offs.

Striker Assombalonga had a brilliant first season at Posh bagging goals galore. Last summer he was with the squad for the pre-season training camp in Portugal. Fans were told he wouldn’t be leaving, the manager was under the same impression. Yet hours before the start of the season he joined Nottingham Forest for a record fee. Posh have never recovered and struggle to score.

Key summer signings Taylor and Maddison were brought in to provide and score goals – both have been injured for huge chunks of the season. In one of the rare games they played together, Posh absolutely destroyed Crawley 4-1 away from home to go second in the table. I was there that day and Posh could have scored 10.

Under Ferguson this season one of the club’s talents from the academy Joe Newell has blossomed, and proved many of his noisy doubters wrong. Credit to the manager for sticking by his player when most of the fans thought he was a no-hoper.

Ferguson has made mistakes: he cannot spot a good goalkeeper; he trusted the wrong man – Jack Payne - to be captain of the club this season – he’s not a leader and his game crumbled under the pressure; he discarded a club legend Grant McCann brutally and unnecessarily; and his ability to change a game that’s hurtling towards defeat has consistently been woeful.

This is about how incredibly difficult it is to succeed at unfashionable clubs in the lower leagues.

Posh are a small club in the Fens with a loyal but tiny fanbase.

If I get the job I'll bring 24-hour energy, expertise drawn from 40 years watching football and over 25 years reporting on it, picking the brains of some of the best and worst coaches and players in the game worldwide.

I’ll play old-style wingers, overlapping full backs, I’ll ask my centre halves to be beasts, I’ll ask my two central midfielders to be creative and destructive at the same time. Hit the wingers as often as possible. Get forward!!!

My policy will be to score more goals than the opposition: it might not always work, but when those players come off the pitch win, lose or draw, the fans will know they tried to entertain and went for the win.

Wives, partners and families of players and staff will be well looked after, with the aim of providing a network of friendship and support within the Posh family.

My only foreseeable problem is winning the trust of the players, a sceptical bunch who are falling over themselves to apologise to Ferguson for getting him and his staff the sack. I’ll do a deal with every single one of them individually, the terms of that deal will remain private, it won’t involve money, but it will involve an incredible amount of support and goodwill both ways. I’ll expect them to run through brick walls for me - because they know I’ll do the same for them.

It’s a tough place to succeed in the lower leagues.

I get on with chairman Darragh MacAnthony, which is a bonus, and I have a love/hate relationship with director of football Barry Fry which I think will work out perfectly. He’ll be pulling one way, I’ll be pulling the other, but I know how to get round Barry, no problem.

Give me the job, because if you don’t you’ll never know how brilliant it could have been.
