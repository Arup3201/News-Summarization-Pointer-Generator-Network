It is a tradition going back 150 years, with hardened swimmers jumping into the sea at Brighton on a crisp Christmas Day. 

But Brighton and Hove City Council has decided it will close the beach on Christmas Day over 'safety fears' after a man got into difficulty in the waters earlier this year and another swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago.

Brighton Swimming Club agreed to follow the council's lead and cancel its annual festive swim after its dedicated group of 30 experienced swimmers taking part has swelled to 4,000 revellers turning up at the beach in fancy dress and after heavy drinking in recent years.

Brighton and Hove City Council has banned a Christmas day swim after two previous incidents and will be closing its beaches around Palace Pier to prevent revellers taking part in the swim, as they did in 2011 

The Christmas Day swim in Brighton has seen thousands turn out to take part, like this reveller in 2010 

A spokesman for the council said: 'This year the council will be taking extra measures to discourage swimmers from taking a Christmas Day dip by closing the beaches around the Palace Pier.' 

The council said it had decided to close the beach after fears over the safety of people getting into the water on Christmas day. 

An experienced male swimmer had to be rescued in October and a spokesman said they were concerned a similar thing could happen during the festive swim. Also in 2012 a woman died during a similar swim in Hastings and a year earlier a man had to be rescued.

Seafront Manager Chris Ingall added: 'Sea swimming takes skill, stamina and knowledge of the physical dangers and should only be for the very experienced, using suitable wetsuits, in very calm conditions and with a friend.

'Even on a calm day sea currents, undertow or a sudden change in weather can create life threatening hazards without warning.

'Even experienced swimmers can get caught out.'

The cancellation ends a 150 year tradition for Brighton Swimming Club. 

Fiona Southwell, sea swimming coach at the club, said it was a shame for club members but necessary to ensure people's safety as the event had become so large and unwieldy it was dangerous. 

In 2011 dozens of swimmers turned up at Brighton beach for the swim and a man had to be rescued 

In 2009 a team of Santas took part in the swim, but fancy dress can make it dangerous for the inexperienced

She said there are no lifeguards on the beach on Christmas Day and it was impossible to rely on the swimming club and the RNLI to look after thousands of people who lack understanding of the tides and risks of swimming in such cold temperatures.  

She said: 'It's become unsafe. We have an 8C sea that people have to get into by jumping off a shelf. People are not aware of the environment and dangers. 

'Hypothermia was one of the biggest problems we had and the event just became unmanageable. It went from being a club-only swim to a massive public. 

'When it started there were about 30 people in our club taking part. 

In 2008 a Christmas day swimmer is pictured in full Santa outfit taking part in the swim in freezing waters 

'But our club basically became responsible for looking after 4,000 ridiculous people in costumes who were throwing themselves in the sea after drinking alcohol.' 

Ms Southwell was one of the people who rescued a man taking part in the event three years ago, who had been drinking heavily the night before and had come in fancy dress - which can often restrict swimmers once they are in the water. 

She added: 'The biggest turnout we ever had was when we nearly lost a member of the public. I and three other club members had to go in and save this man. That was really the end of the line. 

'We fully support the council. We are sad that we've had to stop a 150 year tradition but we fully support this for health and safety reasons.' 

Last year as the south of Britain was battered by heavy rain and storms Brighton and Hove Council also closed the Palace Pier in a bid to stop people venturing into the sea. 

Members of Brighton Swimming Club, pictured in 2002, will not be able to take part in the swim after the club cancelled the event because it has become dangerous with too many inexperienced people turning up 

Brighton Swimming Club said people have been turning up without knowledge of the dangers of swimming in cold waters and often after a heavy night's drinking, putting themselves in danger once they get in the sea 

Ms Southwell added: 'We supported this action by the council. What we do is pretty extreme and specialised. We can't be seen as a bad example and encouraging the normal public to think it's ok to do what we do.' 

She said it was especially dangerous at Brighton because the pier is shelved - meaning people have to drive straight into the freezing waters to take part.

At beaches like in Exmouth, where the Christmas Day swim is still due to take place this year, the risks are much lower as people are able to walk into the sea from the wide beach.

Last year dozens of swimmers braved the cold to swim in the Serpentine in London for the Peter Pan Cup 

Serpentine Swimming Club said the popular Christmas Day swim would be going ahead as planned this year

Serpentine swimming club, based in London, is also going ahead with an annual Christmas Day swim this year. It will be the 150th anniversary of the event, which begins at 9am as swimmers compete for the Peter Pan Cup. 

Author J M Barrie became associated with the Christmas Day race in 1903 and donated the first cup for the winner. 

The traditional Saundersfoot swim, this year with a World War One theme, will also take place on New Year's Day in Wales.
