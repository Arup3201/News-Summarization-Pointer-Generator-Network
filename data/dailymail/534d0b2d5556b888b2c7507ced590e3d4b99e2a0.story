Early learning programs may help children stave off obesity along with helping them do better in school, a new study suggests.

Researchers from the University of Michigan looked at the BMIs of 19,023 children enrolled in Head Start - a federally-funded pre-school education service for low-income families.

After a year, almost three-quarters of the 16per cent who were initially obese had a become a normal weight. Similar patterns were seen for overweight infants on the course.

Early learning: Head Start programs have been shown to help poor children do better in school, but they may also help them fight obesity, a study suggests 

This trend did not apply to children from Medicaid families and only slightly so with those from wealthier, privately insured families.

Lead author Julie Lumeng says there a several factors of Head Start that could have a positive impact on a child's BMI.

The quality of federally-regulated food provided may be higher than that in other child care facilities and pupils could have more opportunity for physical activity.  

Researchers say the potential benefits are important because obesity is so hard to treat and disproportionately affects low-income children.

Dr. David Ludwig, a Harvard Medical School pediatrics professor and director of an obesity prevention center at Children's Hospital Boston, called the results 'encouraging'.

Head Start is a federal pre-kindergarten program offered free in every state to low-income families.

It often involves full-day preschool, focusing on school readiness, healthy eating and physical activity. 

Many programs provide children two daily meals, and give families health and nutrition advice. 

More than 1 million U.S. children participate.  

Nationwide, about eight per cent of preschoolers are obese, but the rate was mostly higher during the 2005-13 study.

The recent piece of research was published online Monday in Pediatrics.
