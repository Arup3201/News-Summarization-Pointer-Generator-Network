The mother and father of a eight-year-old boy who allegedly died of scurvy will no longer face criminal charges, prosecutors  said today.

Julie Seabridge, 46, and her husband Glynn, 47, had faced trial amid accusations of child neglect following the death of their son Dylan in 2011.

But Swansea Crown Court heard today that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to drop the case against the Pembrokeshire couple following a 'detailed review'.

District Crown Prosecutor for Wales Iwan Jenkins said Mrs Seabridge was too unwell to stand trial while saying it was 'not in the public interest' to pursue the case against Mr Seabridge.

'We have recently concluded a detailed review of the prosecution case against Glynn and Julie Seabridge, in relation to the tragic death of their son Dylan,' he said.

'Due to the very complex and serious nature of this case, expert advice and guidance has been sought from a number of sources by both the prosecution and defence teams.

The case against the parents was dropped after lawyers concluded Julie Seabridge was too ill to stand trial and it would not be in the public interest to pursue proceedings against her husband

'Taking account of the very many factors involved, it is our view that Julie Seabridge is unfit to face criminal charges on health grounds.

'In relation to Glynn Seabridge, our conclusion is that it is not in the public interest to pursue a prosecution against him.

'There are a number of public interest factors weighing against the need for a prosecution of Mr Seabridge in this case. 

'These are related to concerns about his health and the likely effect of a prosecution on him, as well as the nature of the case and the likely penalty that a court would impose in the event of a conviction.'

The couple denied any wrong doing and claimed that Dylan had a medical condition which meant he wasn't getting enough vitamin C. 

The CPS added its decision did not 'imply any finding concerning guilt or criminal conduct'.

Mr Jenkins added: 'The CPS makes decisions only according to the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and it is applied in all decisions on whether or not to prosecute.

Scurvy used to affect anyone who was at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored.

They would begin to suffer when they could not get enough vitamin C - vital for the body as it needs it to make collagen, a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage.

Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down.

Signs of the condition included muscle and joint pain, fatigue, red dots on the skin, and bleeding and swelling of the gums, which can lead to teeth falling out.

In 1753 A Royal Navy Scottish surgeon, James Lind, realised that citrus fruits - which have large amounts of vitamin C - could combat the condition and published a study on it.

Modern treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C. 

'As a result of our review conclusions, we have today informed the court the prosecution offers no evidence against either Glynn or Julie Seabridge.'

While criminal proceedings have now concluded, a coroner's probe into Dylan's death is yet to take place.

His inquest was opened and adjourned three years ago.

At the full hearing a coroner will be unable to apportion blame over the death due to law.

However, is it is expected that the fact-finding mission will give an official cause of death as well as looking at the events leading up to the tragedy.Scurvy was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea.

But it is almost unheard of due to modern diets and health care .

Symptoms of scurvy are lethargy, spots on the skin, spongy gums and bleeding from the nose.

Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C.

This should quickly reverse the harmful symptoms of scurvy, the NHS says.

Foods such as cabbage, grapefruit, sweet potatoes, lemons, broccoli, limes and tomatoes are all good sources of the essential vitamin.
