Around 1,500 airline passengers were forced to land at the wrong airports today as fog and emergency repairs forced Gatwick to shut their main runway.

A total of 24 flights were forced to touch down at other UK destinations due to
the combination of poor visibility and runway repairs, a Gatwick 
spokesman said.

Engineers were carrying out planned maintenance work to the airport's main runway overnight, leaving just the second landing strip open.

Shutdown: Gatwick Airport operators were forced to divert planes this morning due to poor visibility and runway repairs

The south-east of England was blanketed in fog this morning for the first time after days of hot weather.

However, the sky is expected to clear later and temperatures could hit 25C in London and the south-east of England.

Met Office forecaster Ruth Steele said: 'There is an area of quite extensive mist and fog which might be a bit slow to clear.

'By mid-day it should be clear and most places will be throughout the morning with some potential for showers later.

'There is still potential for temperatures between 22C and 24C. The centre of London expected to be the warmest and temperatures could hit 25C.'

In the north-east, Newcastle will have a cloudy day and temperatures are expected to reach no higher than 14C, while in Manchester it will be 19C.

Fog this morning meant short and medium-haul 
flights from Gatwick had to be diverted to Stansted, Luton, Bristol and Heathrow from
around 12.10am onwards.

Closure: Runway repairs were being carried out at Gatwick - and the back-up landing strip could not be used because of fog

A spokesman for Gatwick Airport said that the main runway was shut for maintenance repairs overnight.

'We had some planned runway maintenance 
works scheduled for last night which all flight operators were informed 
about and when we do that we have to use our second runway which is a 
visual strip,' he said.

However, he added that as pilots have to land manually on this second runway it could not be used during foggy conditions.

As a result, 24 planes were diverted to other airports. All the passengers were transferred back to Gatwick by coach.

Easyjet, British Airways and Thomson passengers were affected by the disruption.

Three BA short-haul flights due to depart Gatwick this morning have been cancelled because of the disruption and eight flights have been delayed, the spokesman added.

The main runway reopened at 5.30am and there was no disruption this morning.
