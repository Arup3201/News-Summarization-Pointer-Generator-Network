The owner of a suburban Chicago pizzeria was gunned down early Thursday morning saving his beloved wife during an attempted armed robbery after closing.A drifter has been charged with two counts in the shooting death of Giovanni Donancricchia, the heroic pizzeria owner who distracted the shooter while his wife fled to safety. Returning to defend his business, Giovanni was then allegedly shot in the chest, according to police.Donanricchia, 64, allegedly saw Matthew Brown-Turner enter his Cicero pizzeria after midnight Saturday morning, pull a gun on his 62-year-old wife Angela and attempt to rob the joint, officials said. Rising to the occasion, Giovanni was able to get his wife to safety before returning to defend his restaurant. The Italian immigrant was shot in the chest and the gunman fled the scene, cops said.

Hero: Giovanni Donancricchia hurrying his wife out of their pizzeria before later returning to confront the armed robber

‘Giovanni observed the offender with the gun and entered through the swinging door and physically confronted the offender, giving his wife time to escape from the area,’ the Chicago Tribune reported officials said in a statement.Brown-Turner, 25, then reportedly fled down an alley and was arrested early Friday morning after admitting to a friend during a news report that he was the killer. It didn’t take the friend long to call police and gave him up, cops told the Tribune.

The alleged killer was denied bail Saturday after being charged with murder and attempted armed robbery, according to media reports. Identified in conflicting reports as either a Chicago man or as living in Buffalo, Brown-Turner later made incriminating remarks during police questioning, according to officials.

This is not Brown-Turner’s first run-in with the fuzz. He previously pled guilty to felony drug possession in May 2009 after being arrested by Chicago police on suspicion of heroin possession the previous month, records show. A warrant was then issued two years later after repeated parole violations, that warrant was also served during his Saturday arraignment, according to reports. The suspect is currently being held in a local jail.

Thug: Brown-Turner was snitched on by a friend after admitting to being the killer while they watched a local tv news report on the shooting

Donancricchia had owned Albano’s 
Pizzeria for 25 years and had worked his whole life since immigrating to
Chicago from Sicily in 1968 at the age of 19. The restaurant was 
popular among locals in Cicero, about 10 miles west of Chicago, and even
featured on multiple local and national TV shows, according to media reports.‘My
father built his business for 25 years and to shut down his dream won’t
make sense,’ the Donancricchia’s son Saverio told WLS. ‘We also want to
reopen in his memory and to continue his legacy.’ Saverio told the 
station his family will reopen the now-closed pizzeria June 28, with an 
off-duty police officer hired as security.

'It makes us feel safer. We plan on going back into the restaurant and getting it up and going and re-establishing it at some point soon. It might not be as soon as we think we can do it because it's been difficult for all of us on and off. At times we keep it together. At others we fall apart,' the slain man's son-in-law Bill Fleischer told the station. Cicero town officials hailed the popular pizza chef as a hero.‘Giovanni Donancricchia was a real hero,’ Ray Hanania, Cicero Town spokesman, said in a statement cited by multiple local media outlets. ‘When he discovered that an unknown person had entered his restaurant from the backdoor with a weapon, and confronted his wife Angela, his first concern obviously was for his wife's safety. With a disregard for the threat the killer posed to him, he ushered his wife out of the restaurant and harm's way, which saved her. He then returned to confront the suspect when he was shot and killed.'
