Five cannon that were once used by Blackbeard to terrorize the Atlantic shipping lanes have been recovered from a wreck that belonged to the notorious pirate.

The cannon, one weighing 3,000lb, are the latest artifacts divers have salvaged from the wreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge, which ran aground off North Carolina in 1718.

Since the wreck was found on a sandbar in Beaufort Inlet in 1996, a team of archeologists have scavenged the ship for treasures including gold dust, coins, glass beads and a pewter syringe.

'Today is definitely a red-letter day: five guns coming off the site,' David Moore, who has been part of the recovery team from 1996, told CBS News.

The weapons, brought to the surface on Monday, would have fired 6lb cannon balls at any ships daring to confront them.

'This is spectatular. This is the most cannon we have ever raised in a single day,' Faye Mitchell, of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, said.

'We also raised two concretions which are these barrel hoops they used to store food provisions and things like that,' she told WPTV.

Historians believe the largest cannon found was made in Sweden, meaning Blackbeard who was also known as Edward Teach or Thatch, had guns from different countries on board.

Feared: The Queen Anne's Revenge, a former slave vessel, was the head of Blackbeard's fearsome flotilla

In total, 40 cannon were believed to have been on board the Queen Anne's Revenge, a former French slaveship taken by Blackbeard and his men off Martinique in 1717.

Since the wreck was discovered in 1996, 22 of the ship's guns and about 280,000 artifacts have been recovered.

The location and size of the ship, as well as the finds, has led experts to conclude that the ship really is the Queen's Anne Revenge.

'It's in the right place, from the right time. The artifacts are all dating to the appropriate period. She was the right size ship. It's nothing else it can be,' David Moore, from Beaufort's maritime museum said. 

Once the cannon and other artifacts have been recovered, they are sent to a laboratory in Greenville to be cleaned and analyzed.

'For every month we spend here on the
 site, you spend 11 or 12 months in the lab getting these artifacts 
cleaned and interpreted and analyzed,' Mr Moore said.

The five cannon will be the last of the treasure to surface this year, as the dive ends for the year.

'We're going to continue excavating the site and have it completed by 2014,' project director Billy Ray Morris said.

An exhibition of the finds, including an 11ft anchor weighing nearly 3,000lb that was found in 2011, is on display at Beaufort's North Carolina Maritime Museum.

Other finds have included onion bottles, bells, buckles and a partly gilded hilt thought to have held Blackbeard's sword.

After running aground off North Carolina in 1718, the pirate escaped to another ship in his flotilla and continued his life of piracy for another six months until forces hired by Virginia's governor killed him.

To prove the pirate was dead Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard, who led the fatal attack, returned to Virginia with Blackbeard's severed head hanging from his ship's bow.
