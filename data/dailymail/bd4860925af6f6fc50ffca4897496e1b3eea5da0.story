When lonely yachtsman Colin Hodgson met widowed church warden Bertha Stanley, he became obsessed with winning her heart.

Although told his attentions were unwanted, he bombarded her with gifts, phone calls, invitations and notes declaring his love – eventually forcing Mrs Stanley to go to police, who handed the retired engineer a caution.

But even that was not enough to stop Hodgson, 75, taking his campaign of harassment to more disturbing lengths.

Colin Hodgson, 75, became England's oldest stalker after pleading guilty to stalking Bertha Stanley, 64

When Mrs Stanley, 64, went to her late
husband’s grave on the anniversary of his death, she found her stalker 
had beaten her to it – leaving behind a handwritten love letter in 
anticipation of her arrival.

Yesterday
the sailor’s obsession earned him a criminal record as he narrowly 
escaped jail and was served with a restraining order barring him from 
contacting Mrs Stanley.

But
he remained apparently unrepentant, saying after the court case: ‘I 
have been led down the garden path and stabbed in the back.'

Hodgson
lives in a £400,000 cottage in the village of Copster Green in 
Lancashire’s Ribble Valley, but spends much of his time staying on a 
motor cruiser moored in Skippool Creek, near Poulton-le-Fylde, where he 
also has a collection of yachts. He met the church warden in November 
2009 when she saw him sitting alone at St Anne’s Church in the village 
of Singleton, close to his yacht club, a court heard.

‘They
started to chat,’ Don Green, prosecuting, told Blackpool Magistrates’ 
Court. ‘Later he discovered she was a florist and found out her work 
phone number. He invited her to an event at his yacht club but she told 
him she was a widow and not interested in a relationship. She said she 
was flattered but did not want to go on a date.’

However,
the court heard that Hodgson started to make frequent calls to Mrs 
Stanley and her staff, despite her making it clear that she did not want
a romance.

Mr Hodgson met florist Mrs Stanley at St Anne's Church, in Singleton (pictured), where she was a church warden, before bombarding her with unwanted gifts, love letters and invitations for holidays

He invited 
her on skiing holidays and even sent ski boots and clothing to her home.
He would park his car opposite her shop, Fylde Flowers, and one note he
left declared: ‘I am in love with you and would go to the ends of the 
Earth for you.’

Colin Hodgson's unwanted attention of widow Bertha Stanley escalated after they met at her local church.

He began by finding out her telephone number and where she worked but after she refused a date he started to bombard her with calls.

He invited her onto his yacht and on a ski holiday and sent her ski boots and clothing.

Mr Hodgson waited outside her house and floristry business and referred to her as his 'lady friend'.

He also sent her bizarre gifts including vitamins and a road sign.

The 75-year-old was arrested after Mrs Stanley found a love letter he had left on her late husband's grave on the anniversary of his death.

He had tracked down the date of his death and where his grave was positioned.

He also
began to send bizarre gifts such as vitamins, a road sign and pottery, 
as well as love poems, and referred to her as his ‘lady friend’.

‘This is a lengthy case involving this man’s unrequited love which turned obsessive,’ Mr Green said.

Mrs
Stanley finally called police who gave Hodgson a caution, making him 
one of Britain’s oldest recorded stalkers. But he continued to bombard 
her with notes.

Matters
came to a head on the anniversary of the death of her late husband, 
Francis, when she went to visit his grave at the church where she first 
met Hodgson.

Guessing 
she would be there, Hodgson had traced the grave and left another love 
letter there. ‘She was shocked and personally violated,’ Mr Green said.

Hodgson was arrested, telling police that he did not think what he had done was harassment.John
McLaren, defending, said: ‘My client thought he was helping someone but
she did not want help. He is a lonely man … and does not have any 
family of his own.

‘He was clearly besotted by this woman. However he now wishes to apologise – he is a chastened man.’

Hodgson
was jailed for 50 days, suspended for 12 months. He was also placed on 
12 months’ supervision, made the subject of a 12-month restraining order
and ordered to pay £360 costs.
