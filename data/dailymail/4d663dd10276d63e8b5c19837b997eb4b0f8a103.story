Three college students and members of one of the nation's top Ultimate Frisbee teams were killed when a semitrailer truck slammed into their SUV after it spun into the wrong lane on an icy Minnesota highway.

The accident happened around 3 p.m. Friday on Highway 3 near Northfield, the Minnesota State Patrol said in an incident report.

All three people killed were students at Carleton College, based in Northfield. The State Patrol identified the deceased as James P. Adams, 20, of St. Paul, Minnesota; Paxton M. Harvieux, 21, of Stillwater, Minnesota.; and Michael D. Goodgame, 20, of Westport, Connecticut.

Two others in the SUV, including the driver, were listed in stable condition Friday, according to a news release from the college. The driver of the truck was not injured.

All of the students were wearing seatbelts, according to the State Patrol, and no alcohol was detected.

It's
 not known where the teammates were headed, but it's possible they were 
driving to the airport to fly to California to play in a tournament 
against Stanford University.

Eric Sieger, media relations director for Carleton College, told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune the students played on the school's Ultimate Frisbee team, which finished third in the country last year.

Sieger said Adams was a chemistry major, Harvieux was a computer science major and Goodgame was majoring in political science.

He said officials couldn't recall another time three students at the 2,000-student school died in a single day. A prayer vigil was planned for Saturday on the campus.

Carleton President Steven G. Poskanzer released a statement Friday offering 'heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the families and friends' of the three students who were killed.

'The collective Carleton soul aches for the loss of these three young men. Right now, we need to focus all our love and compassion on supporting the families and friends of all these young men, along with everyone in our community who cares for them,' he said.

Many people who knew the three young men have taken to Twitter to express their grief and shock at their untimely deaths.

'James Adams was one of the best teammates I've ever had. He showed us what true leadership meant. He was all heart,his loss has broken mine,' tweeted a teammate.

'Prayers being lifted for the Harvieux family. Another life gone too soon. RIP Paxton you'll be forever remembered,' wrote another.

'Michael Goodgame was great writer, a tenacious editor, a caring human being. I'm grateful to have worked with him. He will be missed,' tweeted a Carleton student who worked with Goodgame on the college newspaper.
