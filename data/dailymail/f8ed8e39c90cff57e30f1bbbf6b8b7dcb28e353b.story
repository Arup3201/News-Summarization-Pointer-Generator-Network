Disgruntled tourists are taking to TripAdvisor to slam an extinct volcano that overlooks the centre of Edinburgh for not having wifi, gift shops or enough places to sit.

With a rating of 4.5 the natural beauty has been voted the top attraction in Scotland’s capital after more than 4,500 user reviews on the travel website.

But there are some sightseers who aren’t happy that the windswept peak doesn’t offer an internet connection for their devices or benches to sit on while enjoying the breath-taking views.

One visitor wrote a one-star review on TripAdvisor after visiting Arthur's Seat and finding no wifi connection

One of the one-star reviews of the famous hill lashes out at the absence of any seat at the top ‘for photographs’.

In a TripAdvisor review, one of the visitors wrote: 'Despite the great views after a strenuous walk, what really lets this place down is the lack of amenities.

No gift shop, no free wifi. Nowhere to sit unless you want to sit on the floor. The user added: ‘Could really do with something like a Tesco Express up there so you could buy snacks and things, probably a Starbucks too for a sit down and a coffee’.

Another, who climbed the ancient 822ft slope, added: ‘It was too high and at the top no seat.

‘With the name Arthur's Seat we had expected a chair for photographs.’

One reviewer said that the signage was not clear, and added: ‘It's sad that there is nowhere to buy any food or drink and not even a small gift shop to buy a postcard.’

Another visitor added: ‘But beware of the dogs. People let their dogs run wild up here. It ruins the whole place.

‘Lots of runners and walkers going round the path that rotates the whole hill, but as I say, dogs attack and ruin the whole place.’

Despite a handful of negative reviews, Arthur's Seat tops TripAdvisor's list of must-see Edinburgh attractions - with the website awarding it a 2014 certificate of excellence.

Angus Miller of Geowalks, which leads walking tours around the landmark, said he was ‘not surprised’ the attraction was top rated - and accused those laying into it of being ‘spoon fed’.

He said: ‘I suppose if you have that kind of mentality you do expect just to be able to pick up a coffee and go to the toilet.

Another user complained that 'there is nowhere to buy any food or drink' or a postcard' atop the peak

‘But it's actually a wild area within the city. A lot of people go up there in city shoes as well, and the paths are quite rough.

‘People expect a city walk, but it's wild land. Obviously people are used to being spoon fed.’

He added: ‘I sometimes get people getting confused on tours. I had some guys from Newcastle, and one pointed to Fife and asked if it was Wales.

‘But I'm not surprised that it's top rated - it does seem to be the one thing that people coming to Edinburgh feel the need to do. People seem to be really enthusiastic about it.

"It's such a contrast from the busy streets. It's amazing - the views and the scenery.’

A visitor to Edinburgh Castle wrote on the website that he has 'seen more impressive stuff at Disneyland'

Martin Gray, ranger and visitor services manager for Historic Scotland, which looks after Arthur's Seat, said he was ‘delighted’ visitors had rated the attraction so highly.

He added: ‘In regards to some of the more unusual comments - whilst we are keen to receive feedback, it is after all a mountain - and we would ask any potential visitors to prepare for it as so that they can safely enjoy the wildness of this most special of Edinburgh landmarks.’

Arthur’s Seat was just one of a number of Edinburgh landmarks to face tourists' wrath.

The Scott Monument on Princes Street was deemed ‘too high’ and ‘a dizzying harrowing experience’.

And a visitor to Edinburgh Castle described its 500-year-old crown jewels as ‘a paltry crown and the Stone of Destiny’, adding: ‘I have seen more impressive stuff at Disneyland’.
