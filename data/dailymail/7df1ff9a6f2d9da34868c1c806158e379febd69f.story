International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde today revealed she has been charged with 'negligence' in a French corruption probe dating back to her days as finance minister.

The shock announcement came a day after she was grilled by a special court in Paris that probes cases of ministerial misconduct, the fourth time she has faced such questioning in the case.

Ms Lagarde, one of the world's most powerful women, said the decision to investigate her was 'totally without merit'.

Asked whether she intended to resign from the IMF after her fourth round of questioning before magistrates, she responded: 'No.'

She and her former chief of staff 
face questions about their role in a 400 million-euro (£318 million) 
payment to a businessman.

Questioned: IMF chief Christine Lagarde has confirmed she is under investigation in a French corruption probe that dates back to her days as finance minister. She is pictured arriving at a Paris courthouse in March

In exclusive comments to the AFP news agency, she said: 'The investigating commission of the court of justice of the French Republic has decided to place me under formal investigation.

'I have instructed my lawyer to appeal this decision which I consider totally without merit.'

In France, being placed under formal 
investigation is the nearest equivalent to being charged and happens 
when an examining magistrate has decided there is a case to be answered.

It does not, however, always lead to a trial.

Ms Lagarde said she would return to her work in Washington later in the day.

The
£318million payment was made to Bernard Tapie in a dispute with state-owned bank 
Credit Lyonnais over the botched sale of sportswear company Adidas.

Critics have said the deal was too generous and was symptomatic of the cosy relationship between money and power in France.

The
 court investigating the Tapie payment has been constituted specifically
 for allegations of wrongdoing against office-holders.
