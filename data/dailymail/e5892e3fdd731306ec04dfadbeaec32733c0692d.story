Chelsea were denied another clear penalty  in their 2-0 win over Newcastle – fuelling Jose Mourinho's suspicions that the club is suffering from a media campaign which is influencing referees’ decisions.

Chelsea moved two points clear of Manchester City with their victory at Stamford Bridge but their afternoon wasn’t without controversy after referee Roger East missed a clear handball in the penalty area from Fabricio Coloccini in the 55th minute, which prevented Diego Costa’s cross reaching its intended target.

Jose Mourinho was visibly agitated at what he thought were a number of poor calls made by ref Roger East

Moruinho was charged by the FA last week for voicing his concerns after Cesc Fabregas was booked for a dive two weeks ago against Southampton, when a penalty clearly should have been awarded.

And with Mourinho again declining to speak to the media it was left to his assistant Steve Holland to question the decision of Holland though was more conciliatory that his boss might have been.

‘It could have been a penalty,’ said Holland. ‘It would be nice today not to talk about referees. I think the referee had a good game. I think the team won today regardless. Coloccini had his arm in the air. You could make an argument out: “Why did he have his arm in the air?”

‘The ball clearly struck his arm. Had it not done, the ball would have gone into the area. For sure you could make an argument out for that being a penalty kick but our preference would be to try to focus on the improved performance in the second half.’

Chelsea though were fortunate that East chose to be lenient when Nemanja Matic stopped Remy Cabella with an outstretched-straightened arm in the 73rd minute, choosing to award only a yellow card to the midfielder.

‘There were a couple of challenges from Matic which were a little bit over zealous,’ said Newcastle stand-in coach John Carver. 

Mourinho had plenty to say during the game but he remained tight-lipped after the final whistle

‘I was worried for Remy. He’s only six stone, soaking wet – but he’ll get more of that. He just has to move the ball a little bit quicker.’

Mourinho has failed to appear for scheduled press conferences since his FA charge last week and a Chelsea spokesman said: ‘There is an FA charge and he decided to take a back seat while that is in play.

'The club and the board fully support his position on this. The fact that he wanted to get into a debate over refereeing, over what he saw as a campaign, we full support that to. We think it should be something that can be debated.’

Mourinho clashed with Newcastle coaching staff but he later made up with caretaker boss John Carver
