A Harley Street plastic surgeon could be struck off after he was found guilty of teaching nurses how to administer Botox to patients illegally.

Dr Mark Harrison charged the nurses £400 a day for the training courses at his central London clinic, during which he told them they should give Botox to patients without a prescription.

After being exposed by an undercover investigation, the 51-year-old surgeon denied wrongdoing, but he has now been found guilty of encouraging the nurses to break the law.

Guilty: Surgeon Mark Harrison, pictured appearing in a promotional video, told nurses to use Botox prescriptions on multiple patients

Botox can only legally be administered by a doctor, to a patient with a valid prescription - but a loophole in the law allowed Harrison to authorise nurses to perform the procedure simply by speaking to them on his mobile.

He charged £30 for each 'consultation' - and offered a day-long training course at his practice, Harley Aesthetics, to prepare nurses who want to administer Botox, which makes the skin smoother and is commonly used as an anti-wrinkle treatment.

In 2012, a BBC journalist went undercover posing as a trainee nurse to film the doctor secretly during one of his 'Introduction to Botox' courses.

Harrison, who lives in a £4million Kensington townhouse, apparently told nurses to use Botox on one patient even though it was prescribed for someone else, and encouraged them to ignore a patient's medical history.

He was filmed telling the nurses: 'Strictly speaking a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient. We use it on a number of people. Is it ever an issue? No.

'It is not legal, but it's what everybody does... doctors, professors, me. Just order a vial in your name - it's not policed at all.'

Prescription: The doctor spoke to nurses on the phone and authorised them to administer Botox to patients

In the recording, he also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before administering Botox they should go ahead with the procedure nonetheless and he would authorise it afterwards.

At a Fitness to Practice hearing in Manchester, a disciplinary panel rejected claims that Harrison had been a victim of 'entrapment' by the BBC investigation.

He was also found guilty of making dishonest and misleading statements to an preliminary hearing of the General Medical Council, but cleared of other misconduct charges including a claim that he encouraged nurses to top up Botox with saline solution.

At a previous hearing, Harrison said: 'I can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients, to use vials between patients would be dangerous. It would be unacceptable.

'However, in the context of Botox where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time, I would contend that that is not dangerous, but I have not been accused of doing it.'

Clinic: Harrison practiced from this address in Harley Street, where the courses were held

But finding him guilty, the panel said: 'Dr Harrison, during the Botox course, encouraged attendees to order Botox in the name of patients for whom it was not intended to be used. Dr Harrison, on several occasions, encouraged this practice.'

He now faces further hearings to decide whether his fitness to practise medicine is impaired.

Harley Aesthetics was one of the UK's largest providers of Botox, offering a range of treatments starting from £200.

Harrison built up a network of hundreds of nurses who would call his mobile whenever they wanted authorisation to inject a patient with Botox.

In the wake of the investigation into his practice, the General Medical Council has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as Botox, meaning they must hold a face-to-face consultation with the patient.
