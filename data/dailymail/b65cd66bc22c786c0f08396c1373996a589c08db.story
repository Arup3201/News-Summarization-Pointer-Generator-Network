'This company is a fantastic place to work and our work life is centred around having fun and enjoying what we do,' Travelator said.

'It's things like this that make you feel like you're being rewarded for a years' worth of hard work.

'It only lasts a couple of hours, but it's amazingly fun and everyone gets involved.'

They said the office workers always had new costumes and tactics, with this year's competition being won by the Australian general manager
