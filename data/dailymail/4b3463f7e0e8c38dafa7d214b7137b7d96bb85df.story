Rudy Gestede underlined his value to Blackburn Rovers – and Crystal Palace – as he helped the Championship side into the fifth round at the expense of nine-man Swansea.

Gestede is the subject of a £3.5million bid from Palace but Blackburn are refusing to sell their leading scorer for less than £5m.

They left the Benin international on the bench and he came on to score the decisive second goal in the 78th minute in front of just 5,928 supporters at Ewood Park.

It not only showed that Gestede is unlikely to have any trouble scoring against top-flight opposition, but also why Blackburn’s Indian owners Venky’s are holding out for an extra £1.5m.

Manager Gary Bowyer said: ‘If you look at the last striker that moved into the Premier League and for how much, you’re not talking peanuts these days.

‘Our owners have rightly put a value on him. If that value is match then there’s a decision to be made, but at the moment the figures are nowhere near what they are looking for. If Rudy goes, he will be a big miss.

‘We had no trouble putting back in the squad and putting him on. People involved in the game might try and turn players’ heads but he’s conducted himself magnificently well.’

Bowyer acknowledged that the sending-off of Swansea centre-back Kyle Bartley in the sixth-minute ‘levelled the game’.

Bartley was caught out by the sheer pace of Josh King as the striker chased Matt Kilgallon’s long ball and appeared to lean into his opponent on the edge of the penalty box.

Both players went to ground and it seemed a harsh decision by referee Craig Pawson to produce a straight red card.

Swansea were then reduced to nine men two minutes into added time at the end of the game when Gylfi Sigurdsson allowed frustration to get the better of him and ploughed into the back of Chris Taylor.

The Icelander will now miss the next three Premier League fixtures against Southampton, Sunderland and West Brom, completing a miserable couple of weeks for the South Wales club in which leading scorer Wilfried Bony was sold to Manchester City and they lost 5-0 at home to Chelsea.

‘The season won’t fizzle out, I will make sure of that,’ said manager Garry Monk, who dismissed speculation linking his club with a bid for Gestede’s strike partner Jordan Rhodes.

‘It’s my job and I won’t accept that. We are in a difficult moment but it’s important we come through that together.

‘The first red card was a coming together. Whose arms were across who? You are running a risk as the last defender but, to be fair to the attacker, he didn’t appeal.

‘The second one was harsh. He had a lunge but it wasn’t reckless or dangerous. I think it warranted a yellow card but the ref couldn’t wait to get the red out.

‘You can’t react like that though and I spoke to Gylfi about it afterwards.’

Sigurdsson had fired Swansea ahead in the 21st minute with a stunning right-foot strike into the top corner from 25 yards.

The lead lasted less than two minutes, however, as Tom Cairney knocked down Marcus Olsson’s looping cross to the far post and Taylor hooked the ball past Lukasz Fabianski.

Bowyer sent on Gestede and Rhodes and it was the former who made the breakthrough 12 minutes from time. Gestede’s header from an Olsson cross was blocked but the ball fell kindly for him to bundle it home from close-range.

Craig Conway made sure of Blackburn’s place in the fifth round in the 89th minute when Fabianski allowed his effort from 20 yards to slip through his grasp and trickle over the line.

Bowyer admitted it was a shame that more fans were not at Ewood to see it with the crowd roughly two thirds down on Blackburn’s average league attendances this season. Only a small contingent made the trip from Swansea for a lunchtime game in Lancashire that was being televised on BBC Two Wales.

‘I understand the situation,’ said Bowyer. ‘It’s the end of the month and people aren’t flush with money.

‘Hopefully we’ll get another home draw against a Premier League team and see if we can try and fill it.’
