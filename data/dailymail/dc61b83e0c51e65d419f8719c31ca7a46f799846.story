Deep beneath New York, a giant subway construction project is taking place - and here are the latest pictures of it.

The $4.45 billion project to extend the Q line up and down Second Avenue in Manhattan is expected to be ready for riders by the end of 2016. 

The project will dramatically improve accessibility for the millions of New Yorkers who live on the eastern side of Manhattan.

The line is often referred to as 'The Line That Time Forgot' because it has been an on-again off-again city project since 1929.

When it is completed in 2016, it will be the first new subway line added to the city since 1932.

Last year, construction on the line got some negative attention after a series of accidents.

In
 March 2013, firefighters were called to the construction site to pry a 
worker, 51-year-old Joseph Barone, out of quicksand-like muck. It took 
them four hours to get him out and treat his injuries.

Then in August, back-to-back 'controlled' explosions sent debris shooting onto the street like mortars.
