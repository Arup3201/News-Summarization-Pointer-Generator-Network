Trolleys splashed with blood, curtain rails covered in dust and very suspicious brown marks on the shower floor. 

These were the horrific findings of hospital inspectors - despite the some of equipment in question being marked, quite incredibly, as 'clean'.

The authority responsible for the hospital in question, Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, has now been reported to the Scottish Government over repeated failures to meet hygiene standards.

Numerous pieces of equipment contaminated with blood or body fluids were found by staff from the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate (HEI) when they first visited on September 16 and 17.

During the visit, inspectors found 'significant amounts of dust and grime' in several areas of the hospital.

On their follow-up visit, inspectors were told that more people, equivalent to eight full-time staff, had been recruited to the housekeeping service.

They found that the standard of environmental cleaning in the wards and departments inspected had improved.

However, they noted faecal contamination to the panels at the back of two communal toilets and on one toilet wall, and faecal contamination on the nurse call bell beside a toilet.

They called for immediate action to minimise the risk of infection and returned unannounced on October 3 to assess whether there had been improvements. 

But on their second visit, staff again found patient equipment contaminated with blood and body fluids.

This included four patient trolleys and a bed frame, as well as five commodes which were tagged as clean.

The HEI has now issued seven requirements and three recommendations for NHS Lanarkshire to address, and has raised its concerns with the Scottish Government. 

It found 'significant improvements' are needed to ensure the environment and patient equipment in all wards and departments are clean.

Inspectors also said that standard infection control practices need to be recorded accurately in the data management system to target areas where improvement is needed.

HEI chief inspector Susan Brimelow said: 'I am extremely disappointed by the findings from this inspection.

Inspectors also found splashes of 'body fluid' on seated scales at the hospital during the second visit

'Significant amounts of dust and grime' in several areas of the hospital, the hygiene report found 

'During inspection on September 16 and 17, we found patient equipment which was not clean and a poor standard of environmental cleanliness in all wards and departments inspected.

'We escalated our concerns to senior management on September 17 2014 and requested that immediate action be taken to minimise the risk of infection.

'We also asked NHS Lanarkshire to produce an improvement action plan to show how these issues would be rectified.

'On Friday October 3, we returned unannounced, to ensure improvements had been made and to assess progress with the improvement action plan.

'Although we saw some areas of improvement, issues with the cleanliness of patient equipment and the environment remained.

'Due to the serious nature of our findings, I escalated my concerns to the Scottish Government.

'We will continue to inspect Hairmyres Hospital to ensure that improvements are made, as every patient coming into hospital should expect their local hospital to be safe and clean.'

However, inspectors did find some areas of good practice such as good hand hygiene and use of the correct personal protective equipment.

Substantial improvements' are needed to ensure the environment and patient equipment in all wards and departments are clean, the inspectors said

Ian Ross, chief executive of NHS Lanarkshire, said: 'We are sorry that we fell below our own high standards of cleanliness of patient equipment and the environment at Hairmyres Hospital.

'We have acted swiftly to put in place a comprehensive action plan to address these issues. This includes making our systems more robust so there is assurance that patient equipment is clean and ready to use.

'We are also putting in place a system of firm supervision to monitor cleaning tasks giving us full confidence that our wards and departments are meeting a high standard of environmental cleanliness.

'I want to reassure patients and visitors that we have already made substantial improvements at Hairmyres Hospital following the HEI visits.

'Further progress against our action plan will be closely monitored by the NHS Lanarkshire board, which is committed to ensuring all our hospitals provide a safe and clean environment.' 

Health Secretary Alex Neil said: 'This inspection report reveals unacceptable standards in Hairmyres Hospital and I've been clear that NHS Lanarkshire must address the issues highlighted, and ensure that the failures of the PFI provider in relation to cleaning standards specified in the contract are addressed as a matter of priority. 

'It is extremely important that patients and the public continue to have confidence in the cleanliness of Scottish hospitals and the quality of NHS Scotland services - that is why we have introduced these inspections as one of a range of measures to tackle healthcare associated infections.'
