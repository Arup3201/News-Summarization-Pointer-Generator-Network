A couple who left their dog to 'cook to death' in their car as they ate Sunday lunch at a pub which featured in the ITV soap Emmerdale, have been banned from keeping pets.

In temperatures reaching 30C, Millie, a seven-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, 'undoubtedly suffered' in the sweltering heat, despite The Woolpack being a dog-friendly pub.

After discovering Millie's body in their car, Anne, 70, and Kenneth Naylor, 59, reported her death to the RSPCA in Bradford, before asking staff at the centre if they had any puppies they could adopt on the SAME day.

Anne Naylor and her husband Kenneth enjoyed Sunday lunch at The Woolpack in Esholt. The pub was formerly used to film scenes for the ITV soap Emmerdale. The couple left seven-year-old Millie in the back of their car

The couple, were eating at The Woolpack pub in Esholt while Millie, was left in their car on a baking hot July afternoon.

They were banned from keeping animals for three years and each fined £150 after appearing at Bradford Magistrates' Court, yesterday.

They both pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal on July 7 - a day where temperatures were close to 30C.

The Woolpack pub, in Esholt, featured in the ITV soap from 1976 until 1998 when filming moved to a purpose built village on the Harewood Estate.

Millie, a Staffordshire bull terrier, died after an hour in the car with temperatures reaching around 30C

The court heard that despite The Woolpack being a dog- friendly pub - allowing pets in the pub and providing water for them outside - the Naylors decided to leave the seven year old dog in their car while they had Sunday dinner.

When they returned an hour later the animal was dead.

They drove to the Bradford office of the RSPCA where they revealed what had happened.

According to staff they then asked if there were any puppies they could have - a claim the couple deny.

Nigel Monaghan, prosecuting, said: 'It beggars belief that after this they can ask for a puppy from the RSPCA.'

Steven Kaye, defending, said: 
'They deny that they asked the question about getting another puppy. 
They say they have no intentions of getting another dog.'

RSPCA staff found the dog's body tethered to a seatbelt in the back of the car.

When
a member of staff visited the pub to investigate two hours later, at 
around 3pm, they recorded the outside temperature as 28C.

The couple claimed to have left a back window open, parked in a shady area and left water in the car.

A statement from the vet who carried out the post mortem, Graham Roberts, was read to the court.

It
said when dogs are left in hot cars their body temperature rises 
quickly, heart rate increases and they can suffer from vomiting and 
diarrhoea.

It added: 'The dog would develop heat stroke and would have undoubtedly suffered.

'It
would have become more distressed as it attempted to cool itself. It 
must be one of the most unpleasant ways for a dog to die. A dog in a hot
car is essentially cooked to death.'

In mitigation, Mr Kaye said the couple were of good character and had shown remorse after Millie's death.

He added: 'This is a very sad case. They loved this dog for many years and have to face the fact they are responsible for her death.

'They didn't feel it was a particularly hot day.'

He said Mr Naylor had an inoperable brain tumour, and asked for that to be taken into account when sentencing.

As well as the fine, the couple have to pay the RSPCA £100 costs each.
