Salma Parveen's husband strangled her to death with a scarf after she told him their marriage was over

A spurned husband who murdered his wife by strangling her with a scarf after she told him their marriage was over has been jailed for life.

Muhammed Hussain Iqbal, 29, killed Salma Parveen, 22, in the bedroom of their marital home after she announced that she was leaving him.

Iqbal took Salma, a bank clerk, by surprise and killed her by wrapping a scarf around her neck as she was getting read for work on April 29 last year.

After throttling her to death he then 
bound her hands and feet with more scarves and hid her body in their 
house in Coventry before fleeing on a train for London.

He then handed himself in to police a day later where he admitted: 'I come from Coventry where I’ve committed a murder.'

Despite confessing to killing Salma in police interviews, Iqbal pleaded not guilty to one count of murder.

But he was found guilty by a jury of four men and eight women after a three-week trial at Stafford Crown Court.

He was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars.

Sergeant Mick Griffiths, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'Throughout this trial Iqbal claimed that he didn’t intend to kill Salma and that he had suffered a loss of control due to provocation.

'He has changed his defence and alleged in court that Salma attacked him with a knife.

'This was pure fabrication and the jury saw through these lies.

'Their relationship had broken down and Salma wanted him to leave the family home.

'Iqbal chose his moment carefully and then struck. Salma had no chance to defend herself and he killed her in a fit of temper.'

Muhammed Iqbal, who was today handed a life sentence for the murder of his wife, had fled to London from the couple's Coventry home before handing himself in to police

The court heard the couple married in an Islamic ceremony in 2012 but to secure Iqbal’s visa - which expired this year - he wanted to tie the knot in a civil ceremony.

The jury were told Salma was murdered within hours of Iqbal allegedly seeing her kissing another man.

He became enraged when he found out 
Salma - who had been having an affair with a city councillor for over 
three years - had cancelled the wedding just weeks before her death

Married Coventry councillor has  Kamran Caan admitted to the court he had an affair with the 22-year-old which started in 2009 or 2010.

The Labour representative for Upper Stoke called Salma his 'Cinderella' in text messages but said he said he had no intention of leaving his wife for her.

The court heard they had exchanged numerous other messages in the weeks before her death and had arranged to meet on April 30 - the day after she was killed.

After sentencing Salma’s family paid tribute to a 'beautiful' daughter.

They said: 'Salma was the spark of our family and full of ambitions and dreams waiting to come true.

'Her life has not only been taken away from her, our lifestyle, spark and bonding of the family has also gone with her.

'Salma was the person we could trust with our eyes closed, the person who was always there for us, the person who we all looked up to.

'She was so beautiful and so was her heart. She was full of energy and up for any challenge regardless of how difficult it was.'
