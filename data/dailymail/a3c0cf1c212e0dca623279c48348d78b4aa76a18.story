Cancerous tumours may grow faster at night time, a new study has found.

Israeli researchers found that cancer cells grow and spread around the body more quickly during sleep, because of the relationship between two receptors in cancer cells.

They concluded that giving cancer treatment at night might be more effective than administering drugs in the day time.

Tumours may grow and spread more quickly at night time, because of the relationship between two receptors in cancer cells, Israeli researchers found

The study looked at the activity of two receptors in cancer cells in mice.

Receptors are protein molecules on the cell's surface or within cells which take in biochemical messages secreted by other cells and pass them on into the cell's interior.

Scientists found that a receptor called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) - which causes cancer cells to grow and migrate - is suppressed by the activity of another receptor.

The second receptor binds to a steroid hormone called a glucocorticoid (GC).

GC plays a role in maintaining the body's energy levels during the day.

It is often called the stress hormone because levels of the GC steroid rise in stressful situations to make the body fully alert.

With multiple receptors, the cell receives all sorts of messages at once, and some of these messages can take precedence over others.

Scientists found that when the GC receptor is bound to the steroid hormone GC, the activity of the EGFR receptor in promoting the growth and migration of cancer cells is suppressed.

They tested levels of EGFR in mice throughout the day and found that the receptor is much more active during sleep and inactive in the early morning waking hours.

Researchers explained that levels of GC steroids peak in the day and tail off at night, meaning in the day time the body suppresses EGFR's activity in promoting cancer cell growth.

However, in the night when levels of GC steroids are low, EGFR is not suppressed, and promotes growth and migration of cancer cells.

The scientists then wanted to know how their findings affected treatment using drugs which fight cancer.

It could be more efficient to give anti-cancer drugs at night, the study found

They gave Lapatnib - a drug used to treat breast cancer – to mice with cancer.

Lapatnib is designed to inhibit EGFR and so to prevent the growth and migration of the cancer cells.

In the experiment, they gave the mice the drug at different times of day.

They found that there were significant differences between the sizes of tumours in the different groups of mice, depending on whether they had been given the drug during sleep or waking hours.

These findings suggested that it is indeed the rise and fall in the levels of GC steroids over 24 hours that promotes or inhibits the growth of cancer.

Researchers concluded that it could be more efficient to give anti-cancer drugs at night.

Professor Yosef Yarden, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, one of the study's researchers, said: 'It seems to be an issue of timing.'

'Cancer treatments are often administered in the daytime, just when the patient's body is suppressing the spread of the cancer on its own. 

'What we propose is not a new treatment, but rather a new treatment schedule for some of the current drugs.'

The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.
