A 74-year-old man has been charged with assault and child cruelty as part of an investigation into historic child abuse in the care system in North Wales.

Peter Steen, from the Wrexham area, is charged with three offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and four charges of child cruelty, the National Crime Agency said.

The offences are alleged to have taken place against four boys and one girl - aged between 13 and 16 - from 1978 to 1986. He has been bailed to appear at Mold Magistratesâ€™ Court on June 12.

Steen is the third person charged under Operation Pallial, which is looking at offences allegedly committed against people aged between six and 19 from 1953 to 1995 at care homes in North Wales.

Earlier this week MailOnline reported how Richard Dafydd Vevar, 62, from Wrexham, had been charged with two offences of indecent assault against a boy aged between 13 and 16. Another man, John Allen, 72, has been charged with a string of child sex offences and awaits trial later this year.

Latest figures show 37 people have been investigated as suspects under Pallial, with 20 arrests made. A total of 255 people have reported allegations to the NCA, and information from 212 is under active investigation. Some 28 care homes in North Wales are involved in the investigation.

At the time the investigation was announced, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, from Merseyside Police, senior investigating officer for the inquiry, said: 'Operation Pallial is investigating new allegations of historic child abuse, some from victims previously known about and some from victims who have come forward for the first time.

'All victims of abuse have a right to expect all allegations of abuse, no matter how much time has passed, to be investigated professionally and appropriately. We will do so.

'Equally importantly, if offenders are still alive, they must be identified, investigated and brought to justice, with those who still have access to children being prioritised.'
