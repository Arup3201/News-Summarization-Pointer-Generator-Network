William Shakespeare famously penned the wisdom that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

So what exactly is in a name? 

Apparently quite a bit, at least according to this list compiled by Kidspot, detailing the most definitive monikers likely to brand your child a 'bogan'. 

But first, a definition. 

bogan/ˈboʊgən/ (say ‘bohguhn)

noun Colloquial (mildly derogatory) 1. a person, generally from an outer suburb of a city or town from a lower socio-economic background, viewed as uncultured; originally typified as wearing ugg boots and tights, or footy shorts and thongs in public and having a mullet hairstyle.

The bogan baby-a new phenomena for Australia?

Endearingly and embarrassing ingrained into Australian culture, the bogan is a familiar figure at the local pub, wearing footy shorts and thongs, or a bejewelled matching tracksuit and poorly disguised hair extensions.

A harmless and often entertaining local legend, the bogan is as much a part of the nation's image as BBQ's and beaches. But is the cultural legend of the ever-present bogan possessive of characteristics a parent would want for their new child?

Whilst parents can often be overwhelmed when searching for potential names for their progeny, it is best to choose wisely. A baby's sobriquet is, after all, branded onto birth certificates for all eternity.

What does a name say about a person, or mean for a baby's future?

It can seem safe to settle on a compromise of a traditional name spelled a new way, or to call a child after a person or place which evokes hopes for the future, but what do the names really mean for a new baby? 

Guru's of Aussie culture Kath and Kim poked fun at the prolific trend of creating a unique baby name. Baby Epponnee-Ray was the butt of many commentators jokes, as was the intention.

And it seems that no young girl is complete without her very own apostrophe these days. Chris Lilley's Jai'me can attest to that, and with names such as Princ'ess making the cut, one can only wonder where the symbol might work its way into.

As the list, which pokes fun at quite offensively and outrageously bogan titles, proves, getting adventurous with baby names may be fun, but perhaps not always wise.

6. Holden 

7. Kash 

8. Storm 

9. Tyson 

10. Zaiden 

Girls:

1. Caprice

4. Mercedes 

5. Nevaeh 

6. Princ’ess 

7. Rybekkah 

8. Shiraz 

9. Skylah 

10. Vegas

Recently, various spellings of common names such as Brittney and Mikayla, or Jacob and Jason, have all paved the way for names which make the list such as Jorja (Georgia).

Mercedes, Cruz, Holden and Vegas all seem to fall into an 'aspirational' category of wanting fame, fortune, or glamour for one's child.

So here is a selection of the top names, with commentary from Kidspot included (try not to laugh).

Kash, Vegas, Tyson, Prin'cess and more bogan baby names!

The Victorian Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages recorded that there were 6,932 unique girls names and 5,965 unique boys names registered in 2013. 

Jackson was a unique name growing in popularity, with 199 baby boys given the name last year. 

There were varied spellings of Jackson, with 140 boys were named Jaxon and 32 named Jaxson.  For girls, Isabella was a popular choice for girls with 332 plus variations including Bellas, Isobels, Mabels and Arabellas.

Director and Registrar Erin Keleher noted that parents choose names for a range of reasons including honouring their family, tradition and popular culture, the Registry's website said.

Whilst a bogan baby name is not a death sentence, and may even be a convenient conversation starter as the children get older, these names will certainly draw attention and probably questions.

Winning gold in this particular event, which classifies as almost Olympian in the gymnastic-like contortions of regular names, is perhaps not something to aim for after all. 

How have you chosen your children's names?

Making a name unique can be tough- so many parents settle for unique spelling instead

Misspellings, apostrophes, and more!

Does your child's name make the top of the bogan list?

@highlight

What does a name mean for a baby's future?

@highlight

Caprice: French for “impulsive change of mind”, Caprice recalls a shiny Holden sedan and a clear-stilettoed stripper all at once. Not the classiest associations to be made with your daughter, but each to their own.

@highlight

Anfernee: When you take an entirely respectable name like Anthony and deform it so it sounds like you’re missing your front teeth, you gots to be bogan.

@highlight

Kash: Ah, a misspell of the already mega-bogan, money-grubbing name Cash. You’d better be ready for a massive five-finger dollar-sign ring and a gold tooth on this kid.

@highlight

 Vegas: While it’s been a tight race down this list, I do believe that naming your baby girl after the cheapest, tawdriest, most debaucherous city in the world takes the bogan cake.

@highlight

Tyson: Sure, why not name your child after a bad-ass boxer with a face tattoo who did hard time for an unspeakable crime (allegedly)? Oh, but use his last name ‘cause dats mo’ bad-ass than plain ol’ “Mike”.  

@highlight

Princ’ess: As if naming your daughter Princess isn’t bad enough, you also feel the need to insert a completely random apostrophe in the middle of it? Similar specimens include D’Lilah and Al’xandra, but at least the apostrophe actually replaces a letter in these cases. (NB: that’s what apostrophes do).
