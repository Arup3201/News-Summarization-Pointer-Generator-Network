Retreat: Chancellor George Osborne has backed down on two particularly unpopular parts of his March Budget but many may still pay more for their pasty if it is warmed after baking

Millions are celebrating today as the hated ‘pasty tax’ is to be reversed after a huge campaign across Britain caused a Government U-turn.

But it appears many could still end up paying around 50p more if they want the delicious snack piping hot.

George Osborne has decided that as long as hot takeaway food is cooling naturally, it will not be subject to 20 per cent VAT, as planned.

Greggs, Britain's biggest high street baker, does not reheat food and is celebrating this morning as it will no longer be forced to put up its prices and potentially sack staff.

Its shares, which plunged by 15% when the tax was announced in March, have jumped up 30p with today's news.

But controversially, as many pasties are kept warm in smaller bakeries under lights or on hot plates, the tax will still apply to these purchases, raising its cost to an average of £3.

The price increase, up from an average of £2.50, will also apply to ones kept in foil or packaging that keeps it hot, or reheated in a microwave.

Only pasties, and other hot snacks like sausage rolls and pies that are served straight from the oven or are allowed to cool down in a glass cabinet, will continue to be tax-free.

So unless pastry enthusiasts time their trip to the bakery just as they are just baked they will have to pay more for a warm one.

In a letter to the Treasury select committee the Chancellor will also announce a retreat on another controversial measure in his badly received March Budget - a proposal to levy VAT at 20 per cent on static holiday caravans.

Instead, they will be subject to just five per cent VAT.

Both VAT rises prompted uproar among Tory MPs in the regions -- with particular anger in the South West at the pasty tax and in the North over the caravan levy.

Mr Osborne has now had to stage three retreats over measures in his Budget, which is blamed by many MPs for starting a slump in the polls for the Conservatives. 

He has already had to announce a £30million compensation fund for churches that would have been hit by plans to start levying VAT on alterations and improvements to listed buildings.

Exemption: The change means food that is allowed to cool in a glass cabinet, such as these pasties in a branch of Greggs, will still be VAT-free

But the rethink on the pasty tax, following a consultation period which has seen bakers march on Downing Street and Ed Miliband visit a branch of Greggs to protest, will be greeted with delight on the Tory backbenches.

Tory MP for Camborne and Rerduth, George Eustice, who has led a campaign for a U-turn, said: ‘This is very good news. It is everything we and the industry have asked for.

‘The key principle is that provided no attempt is made to keep pasties hot, and they’re just cooling naturally, then they will be exempt from VAT. That’s pretty much the position now.

‘Everyone knows Cornish pasties are best eaten lukewarm. This shows we have got a Government that’s doing genuine consultations and listening to public concerns.

Backlash: Hundreds of bakers protest outside Downing Street during a day of action over the controversial 'pasty tax' late last month

‘This will catch what was always the stated target -- supermarkets selling hot rotisserie chickens which they keep hot for hours and sell in foil packaging, and then don’t pay VAT.’

Complex rules: Pasties left to cool naturally are to be exempt, but food in foil packaging is not

MPs from all three main parties had warned ministers the original proposal was unenforceable and would hit jobs and businesses.

VAT is not charged on most food and drink or hot baked goods but is payable on takeaway food sold to be eaten hot. However, hot savouries including pasties and pies are currently exempt.

Ministers originally suggested that all food sold ‘above ambient temperature’ should be subject to VAT to close the loophole.

Now, Treasury sources said it would only be applied to food which is kept hot, or where the natural cooling process is delayed – for instance, where businesses keep food hot in heated cabinets, or under hot plates and heat lamps.

It will also be levied where food provided in heat retaining packaging or other packaging specifically designed for hot food – for example foil-lined takeaway packaging for Indian and Chinese takeaways.

However, it will not be applied to pasties or pies cooling in glass cabinets or displays.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Budget announced a consultation on a change to VAT on hot take-away food, designed to remove inconsistency and ambiguity in the system and level the playing field across the take-away food market.

‘After extensive engagement we have improved the policy, addressing practical concerns, ensuring that the new regime could be as simple as possible to apply.

We have addressed these in a way that allows us to remove the inconsistent VAT treatment, while not imposing any additional requirement on businesses to test the temperature of their products.’

Tory MP Graham Stuart, who organised a mass petition of Parliament by more than 25 MPs, welcomed the move on the caravan tax.

He said: 'We are delighted. It is a victory for the campaign to persuade the Government to think again.

The Government’s U-turns on charging VAT on pasties and static caravans will add £110 million to the deficit, Labour has claimed.

Shadow Treasury minister Lord Eatwell challenged ministers on why the change was not announced in Parliament.

During questions in the House of Lords he asked what other uses for the £110 million had been considered by the Treasury.

Lord Eatwell said: 'The Government’s announcement on VAT yesterday will add £110 million to the annual deficit and cumulatively to the public debt.'

He asked Treasury Commercial Secretary Lord Sassoon to 'explain to the House why the announcement was not first made in Parliament, in contravention of the ministerial code.'

He joked: “And does VAT now apply to humble pie?”

Meanwhile Tory peers have defended the decision.

Lord Sassoon said: 'On a number of issues, including the VAT changes, we said we would consult.

'We have consulted and come up with what we believe is a the right approach having talked to a range of interested parties.'

'Many backbenchers and, privately, ministers behind the scenes talked to the Government and we were successful in persuading them to review the original decision.

'It is great news for the manufacturing industry and also for the park and coastal communities all around the country.'

Mr Stuart said he was happy with the compromise, acknowledging the state of the economy and the need to raise revenue.

Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Gilbert welcomed the pasty tax move after tabling an early day motion and raising the issue at Prime Minister's Questions.

He said: 'The Cornish people have won and there will be dancing in streets from Land's End to the Tamar as people hear that the Government has dropped their plans to clobber local people and local businesses with this tax.

'The strength of feeling from local people and the national baking industry has been clear since these proposals were announced.

'Plans to extend VAT to batch-baked goods would have been unfair, unenforceable and would have cost jobs and investment across the country.

'Since the Budget, I have worked with the industry to find an alternative and I'm delighted that the Government has listened and agreed.

'This alternative, that I proposed in meetings with the minister and through parliamentary debates, is a workable solution that creates a level playing field with other sorts of hot food and won't endanger jobs, investment or growth.'

Chancellor George Osborne caved in on his plans to charge the 20% rate of VAT on hot baked snacks such as pasties and pies and this has helped Britain's biggest baker.

The climbdown, which followed a campaign to scrap the tax that was supported by 300,000 signatures, saw Greggs shares rise 9% today.

They are up 30p to nearly £5 this morning and rising further.

Last month Greggs revealed a 1.8% drop in like-for-like sales in the 19 weeks to May 12 abnd warned it would be under sustained pressure because of the tax rise.

Greggs chief executive Ken McMeikan said today: 'This is fantastic news for the customer more than anything.

'If we had to put up prices by 20% in the current marketplace when consumers are having a very difficult time we expected there would be an impact on sales but we don't know what it would have been.

'I think the Government deserves to be applauded.'
