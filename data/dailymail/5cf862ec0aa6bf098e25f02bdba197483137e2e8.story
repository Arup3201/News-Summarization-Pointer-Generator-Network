The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore definitely picked the right profession. 

While the topic of weather can be rather doldrums for most, the 50-year-old meteorologist finds it all fascinating as evidenced by his over-the-top on-air reaction to a rare occurrence of thundersnow in Plymouth, Massachusetts Sunday morning.  

In video of the broadcast, Cantore is seen silently waiting, hoping to hear a clap.  

The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore had an on-screen freak-out on Sunday when he witnessed a rare occurrence of thundersnow during a storm in Plymouth, Massachusetts 

When the first lightening strike hits and the snow around him is illuminated, Cantore throws his hands in the air and starts jumping up and down 

'Oh yes, yes, yes! We got it baby, we got it, we got it. Woo! Woo! We got it. Yes. Listen to that! Listen to that!' Cantore yells after the first strike

When the snow around him is illuminated with a flash, Cantore jumps for joy and yells: 'Oh yes, yes, yes! We got it baby, we got it, we got it. Woo! Woo! We got it. Yes. Listen to that! Listen to that!' 

Cantore continues to freak out as five more lightening strikes occur in the span of just a few minutes. 

For Cantore, the moment is priceless. 

'You can have your $500million jackpot in Powerball or whatever it was but I'll take this baby' he says emphatically near the end of the weather phenomenon. 

It has been snowing near non-stop in the Boston, Massachusetts area for the past month, with residents struggling to keep up with the accumulating snow.

Some 400 flights were cancelled at Boston's Logan airport and none took off Sunday morning. Blizzard warnings have been put in place for coastal communities from Rhode Island to Maine through Monday. 

Five more claps of thunder are heard during the span of just a few minutes in coastal Massachusetts 

'You can have your $500million jackpot in Powerball or whatever it was but I'll take this baby' Cantore says
