The overnight fame that comes with joining one of Britain's most popular soaps must be hard to deal with - as EastEnders star Ben Hardy can testify.

The 23-year-old, who last June became the sixth person to play Peter Beale on the show, admits he struggled to cope with the attention.

'I didn't realise the impact it would have on my life,' says Dorset-born Ben. 'The show is so popular that lots of people approach you and ask for photos. Everyone's lovely, but sometimes if you'd rather be on your own it's the last thing you want to do.'

Ben Hardy, who plays Peter Beale in EastEnders, says that he found it difficult to adjust to sudden fame

In fact, Ben found it so hard to cope with fame he shut himself away in the west London home he shares with his actress girlfriend of four years Kat, also 23.

'For a while I didn't want to leave the house,' he reveals. 'Eventually I just got sick of being indoors. Now I take steps not to be noticed when I don't want to be. For instance, I live near Westfield shopping centre, so I won't go there at the weekend.

'But I guess it's just one of those things, and I'm grateful to have such support from EastEnders viewers.'

Ben's profile is set to become even higher as the 'whodunnit' murder mystery of Lucy Beale grows.

As Lucy's 
on-screen twin he's right in the thick of it - and will even be named as
 a suspect. The storyline is set to run into next year, the BBC1 
flagship soap's 30th anniversary.

'I'm
 chuffed to be getting gritty stuff,' says Ben. 'I liked the love story 
with Lola but it's nice to get stuck into a storyline like this. None of
 the cast knows who the killer is, and everyone's talking about it.

Ben says that although he enjoyed the love story between Peter and Lola (pictured), he is enjoying being part of a grittier story line on the show

'I don't think being the killer would fit Peter's character, but I wouldn't shy away from it if that was what was decided.'

Ben, who starred in West End play The Judas Kiss before joining EastEnders, admits he found the transition from stage to screen difficult.

'On stage you rehearse for five weeks and it goes out to 300 people,' he says.

'In EastEnders you get ten minutes to rehearse and seven million people watch it! After such a short rehearsal time you often feel there's more to give. It's frustrating but you just have to put it to one side and get on with your next scene.

'If I had to choose I'd say I prefer the stage, as that's what I've always done. I'd love to play a lead in the theatre.'

For now though, Ben, who's up for Sexiest Male at next month's British Soap Awards ('It's flattering but it's not an accolade for acting, it's genetics!') is happy on Albert Square.

'I don't know how long I'll be in EastEnders. I'll see what happens, what storylines I get,' he says.

Ben is also equally easy-going about matters of the heart - specifically whether he and Kat, who met in the same class at acting school, plan to marry.

'I fancied Kat the moment I met her. She's great and we moved in together about a year ago.

Marriage? I'll see how it goes - we're both young so there's plenty of time yet.'

Holidays: sun or snow? The hotter the better because I like to get a tan and it's cold all the time here.

Greasy spoon or silver service? I prefer an upmarket place because I like a nice cut of steak with chips.

Rum or vodka? Vodka - with lime and soda. It's good for my waistline!

Sport: watching or playing? Both. I played a lot of rugby growing up and I go and watch Arsenal all the time.

Music: pop or rock? I was at Justin Timberlake's London concert recently and turned into a screaming fan!

Cars: vintage or modern? If I could drive any car then it would be the beautiful, old-school Ford Mustang.

Brad Pitt or Joaquin Phoenix? Joaquin. I don't know how he didn't win an Oscar for The Master.
