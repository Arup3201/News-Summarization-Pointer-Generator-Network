Rural drivers concerned they will be banned from using bull bars on their cars have formed a lobby group to raise awareness of how vital they are in the bush.

The Bull Bar Council of Australia has opened up a Facebook page plastered with cars destroyed by accidents they say would have been avoided if the car was equipped with a bull bar, including a 'famous' picture of a dead kangaroo on the back seat of a car after flying through a windscreen.

Police have recently launched a crackdown across New South Wales on bull bars, issuing defect notices to drivers, particularly ones with five-post bull bars, which have been illegal since 2003.

The concerns from bull bar owners have gone underway after a man was believed to be killed when a kangaroo went crashing through his windscreen in Perth

But Nick Wright, who started the Facebook group in July told Daily Mail Australia that there were no clear reasons as to why police are issuing defect notices or warnings to people.

'We’re not entirely sure why police are cracking down on bull bars – Roads and Maritime and police have not made any comments,' he said.

'They tell the media that they're enforcing rules that have been place in 2003 but there's no actual rules that states in the Australian Design Rule (ADR) that "five post bars are illegal.'

Mr Wright, 25, from Taree NSW said the kangaroo incident from October 2006, saw a 50-year-old man die after a car moving in the opposite direction hit the kangaroo, pushing it through the windscreen of the victim's car near Manjimup, 300km south of Perth.

'The photograph of the dead kangaroo in the backseat pretty much sums up the whole point on why it's so important to have these necessities in rural areas,' he said.

Facebook users have taken to the Bull Bar Council of Australia page to form a united front on the issue and raise awareness that lives will be put at risk if they get banned

Another similar incident occurred west of Brisbane in October last year when a six-year-old girl sitting in the back seat of her family car died from a kangaroo smashing through the front windscreen before it exit through the rear window.

Mr Wright said that not only do bull bars save lives, they also prevent major impacts to the engines of vehicles involved.

'If someone was driving in the middle of nowhere and was struck by a kangaroo with no bull bar protection - they would be stranded with no food or water, and even phone reception - So we need to make sure bull bars stay legal,' he said.

A family car was written off after hitting a kangaroo out of Mount Gambier South Australia. The driver said the damage would have been minimal if he had a bullbar

'Rural vehicles operate on rural roads and small towns so there's not a lot of people around and they're not distracted by their mobile phones,' Mr Wright said.

'Children are taught to cross roads safely at a young age but I'm still yet to hear someone teaching a kangaroo, feral pig or wombat how to cross the road.

'I am aware that children do the unexpected sometimes and run out on the road to chase a ball but the potential risk of an animal strike on a rural vehicle without a bull bar are greater than the likely hood of hitting a pedestrian.

This is not a five post bullbar but it was enough to save the lives of this driver and his dad after they hit a cow at 105kmh

Northern Tablelands MP Adam Marshall raised the issue in NSW Parliament, saying he had been inundated with phone calls, emails and letters from people who had been issued with defect notices or warnings from police for having bull bars on their vehicles which don’t comply with Australian Standards.

'People are trying to do the right thing - they are trying to protect their vehicles and their loved ones yet they are being penalised,' Mr Marshall said.

'Many drivers in my electorate have been caught and have been issued with defect notices by highway police patrol for bullbars that have been factory-fitted or fitted by accredited smash repairers and they have unwittingly been driving around - some of them for many years - with bullbars that do not comply with Australian standards.'

This driver of this vehicle said if only he had his five poster bull bar - this wouldn't have happened

'They are incurring expenses of sometimes in excess of $4000 to replace those bull bars which are compliant with the rules,' Mr Marshall said.

'Bullbars are essential for many people living in rural areas, protecting vehicles and, more importantly, protecting people's lives, especially on our roads with huge numbers of kangaroos and other animals around,' he said.

'It's completely reasonable for people who buy a new vehicle from a dealership fitted with a bullbar or have one fitted by accredited businesses assume that it meets with Australian standards. After all, why would a car dealer or a smash repairer fit a bullbar that is illegal? Why would bullbars that don't comply be allowed to be manufactured and distributed?'

This driver said her bull bar saved her life after colliding with an embarkment while falling asleep at the wheel. 'I believe bullbars make a huge difference when it comes to living in the country'

Mr Marshall told the Parliament that he had personally taken the issue up with Minister for Roads and Freight Duncan Gay and Minister for Fair Trading Matthew Mason-Cox.

'Both Ministers were very concerned about the situation and I’m grateful for the action that’s been taken already,' he said.

'The NSW Centre for Road Safety is liaising with NSW Police to raise awareness, as I have with local police, that people are being inadvertently caught in this blitz on illegal bull bars. The Centre is also urging that common sense prevail and those who are unwittingly caught should not be unduly penalised.

'Additionally, the Centre, Roads and Maritime Services, police and NSW Fair Trading are now all working together to gather evidence about manufacturers which are producing and selling these non-compliant bull bars.

'In the meantime, I’m going to keep pushing the case for a change of approach over bull bars to ensure people in rural areas are not unduly penalised for staying safe on the road.
