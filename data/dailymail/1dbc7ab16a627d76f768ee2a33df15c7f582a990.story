Ad follows the 'Live Young' theme

Adults look into a mirror, see themselves reflected as babies and start dancing with their inner children

Evian has brought the dancing babies back for its latest ad campaign, and the video has racked up over 29 million YouTube views in less than a week.

Titled Baby & Me, the spot shows adults who are shocked to see themselves reflected in the mirror as infants.

Then both babies and grown-ups break into a series of complicated dance moves.

Babies are back: Evian's new ad campaign, which has received 29 million views so far, features CGI-enhanced infants dancing in the street

The music is Ini Kamoze's 'Here Comes the Hotstepper,' remixed by French electro artist Yuksek.

According to AdWeek, the campaign will include an outdoor campaign that 
will bring the baby-and-adult mirrored-dancing concept to life on 
digital posters - and will also include an app that allows users to 'babify' themselves via facial recognition software.Â 

'The babies 
are true to our story and heritage,' Laurent Houel, global brand 
director for Evian, tells the magazine.

Baby branding: Evian has been associated with young children since 1935 when it was recommended as a water for babies

'The love affair of the brand with 
babies started in France in 1935, when Evian was first recommended as a 
perfect water for babies.'

'BETC had the idea to go beyond this, and leverage the 
babies into a powerful symbol of purity and youth.'

The company's 2009 spot Roller Babies holds the official Guinness World Record for most-viewed online advertisement to date with more than 65 million views so far.
