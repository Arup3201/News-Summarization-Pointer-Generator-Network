This Indian villager is addicted to eating bricks, gravel and mud, stomaching at least three kilos of his surroundings every day.

Pakkirappa Hunagundi, 30, first developed a taste for the seemingly inedible objects at the age of ten.

Ever since, he has snacked on walls and streets of Karnataka, India - and claims to suffer no ill effects.

Addicted: Pakkirappa Hunagundi has been eating the brick, gravel and mud of Karnataka, India, for years

Despite suffering from the condition since the age of 10, Mr Hunagundi claims to have no digestive side effects

The bizarre eating 
disorder is thought to be a form of Pica, an illness which gives sufferers an appetite for substances without any nutritional 
value.

Sporting a full set of normal-looking teeth, Mr Hunagundi blasts any suggestion he should curb the addiction.

He said: 'I have been eating bricks and rocks for around 20 years now. I love eating them. It has become a part of my life.

'I started at the age of 10. Now it feels like a necessity to me. I can skip meals, but not bricks or mud.

'I have suffered no side effects. My teeth are absolutely fine. I can bite into the hardest stone without a problem.'    

The condition is believed to be a form of Pica, which gives sufferers an appetite for seemingly inedible objects

Despite numerous attempts by doctors and his mother to curb his addition, Mr Hunagundi loves it

His mother has spent 20 years trying to dissuade her son from eating away parts of their house and village.

But Mr Hunagundi says the the building material tastes 'A1' - an Indian term for the best.

Branding it better than 'divine nectar', he says it is best served with a glass of water.

He said: 'Other than bricks, mud and stones, I don't like anything else. Even if you offer me divine nectar, I won't take it.

'My mother says don't eat all this. She keeps insisting, but even if she gives me chicken fry, I don't eat it. I don't like that at all.

'I need mud and bricks to eat. I can't help my own habit.'

People from all over have come to his small village in the south west of the country to see his 'skill' in action

Plated up: While others eat stir fry, Mr Hunagundi is content with building material, washed down with water

He claims he would turn down 'divine nectar' if he had the option to eat a brick, which he highly recommends

One villager said: 'I have known him since childhood. He has always eaten mud and stones since then.

'Even a tiny stone in the mouth hurts so much. But he eats mud and stones everyday with so much ease. We find it extremely strange.'

After news of his brick eating spread, Mr Hunagundi has been inundated with people wanting to watch him going about his everyday activity.

His mother (right) tries to serve him rice every day, but each time he refuses, telling her he is happy this way

Mr Hunagundi, a labourer, has to assure his mother that although he keeps eating the house, he can't stop

One friend said: 'He has become very famous, but he is a poor man. We wish someone would help him.

'When we see him, we feel very bad. We have tried to convince him many times, but he does not listen. We have given up now.

'We advise him not to eat. But when he comes to our field, he goes around eating mud. He relishes hot charcoal too like a snack.'

Villagers say they have grown accustomed to his strange habits, which many find fascinating

Since his father died, Mr Hunagundi has to look after his family, and hopes people will pay to watch him eat brick

Mr Hunagundi, who works as a labourer in his village and struggles to make ends meet, now intends to travel the country to showcase his act.

He said: 'My father died four years ago. I have to take care of my mother. We don't have any income. So I want to make use of my talent.

'I want to show people what I can do. I want to earn some money.'
