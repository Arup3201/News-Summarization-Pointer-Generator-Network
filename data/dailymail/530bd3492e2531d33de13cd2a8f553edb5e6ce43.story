Jailed: Lee Kershaw, 38, was today jailed after sexually assaulting four women while on duty

A policeman was today jailed after sexually assaulting four women in their homes while he was on duty.

Lee Kershaw, 38, who worked for Humberside Police in Hornsea, attacked the 'vulnerable' women on four separate occasions in 2008.

He used his uniform and police car to gain their trust, before sexually assaulting them in their own homes.

Now, he has been jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court after pleading guilty to four offences of sexual assault and four of misconduct in public office. 

The court heard Kershaw, a former soldier, had been previously imprisoned in 2009 for attempting to rape a woman in her home while her young son was strapped to a pushchair in the next room.

During the same period of time, he also sexually assaulted two other women while he was on duty.

Kerhsaw, who served with the Royal Engineers for ten years before joining the police force, changed his name from Lee Rackham following his five-year prison term.

But after his release in June 2012, four further allegations of sexual assault were made against him.

The court heard how all of Kershaw's victims - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had been approached while he was dressed in uniform.

David Bradshaw, prosecuting, said in one of the cases, the police officer had been called to a domestic incident in June 2008 in Hornsea, East Yorkshire.

Kershaw interviewed the woman, who was 'distraught and highly emotional', the court heard.

He then told her he had some documents he needed her to sign, before arriving at her home 'fully dressed in uniform' and touching her intimately as she sat on the settee.

'She signed some forms and was sat on the settee. He engaged her in conversation and committed the offence,' Mr Bradshaw said.

Despite the woman confiding in a friend, she did not report the assault 'for fear of reprisals', the court heard. The attack only came to light when she spoke to another police officer in October 2012. 

Mr Bradshaw said Kershaw’s second victim had just come out of a long-term relationship and had been 'heartbroken' when she met him. 

The mother-of-three, who was 33 at the time, went out drinking with a friend and an argument took place, during which her friend was arrested by police, he said.

The officers who were called to the incident, one of whom was Kershaw, then offered to take the woman and the friend home to 'remove them from the problem'.

The woman was later awoken by a knocking at the front door and, because she was still drunk, answered the door naked. She found Kershaw stood on the doorstep. the court heard.

She then went upstairs to get dressed and remembered being on the bed when the officer touched her intimately.

Kershaw rang her up a few days later, and 'asked her to meet him in lay-bys', but the woman ignored him, said Mr Bradshaw. 

She only reported the assault when she read about Kershaw's other convictions, the court heard.

Meanwhile, the third victim was approached by Kershaw in December 2008 when she was staying with relatives in Hornsea.

She came across a road traffic accident, and the road was blocked, so Kershaw asked her to help him manage the traffic, the court heard.

At some point, the woman gave him her number and the address of where she was staying and later, Kershaw turned up at her house in a police car, apparently to 'make enquiries as to her welfare'.

The victims' family went to bed, leaving them alone, and Kershaw engaged her in conversation, during which he told her personal details about himself. 

Mr Bradshaw said: 'The longer he was there the more uncomfortable she became.'

After the victim moved away from Kershaw, he followed her into the kitchen and then sexually assaulted her. 

The woman felt she was not able to tell anyone and ignored what had happened until she received a phone call from police some years later who said they were investigating Kershaw’s conduct.

Kershaw’s fourth victim was having problems with her 14-year-old daughter, who kept stealing and going missing, and her husband when they met, the court heard.

Mr Bradshaw said Kershaw turned up at her house in full uniform, before he removing his stab vest and 'settling down on the sofa'.

He then went from the living room into the hallway and to the front door, where without warning, he 'kissed her fully on the mouth'. 

She pushed him out of the front door and ten minutes later he rang her to say: 'I’m sorry I do not know what came over me, you are a very attractive woman.'

When he was arrested on October 28, 2013 Kershaw, from Cottingham, claimed one of the women had been flirting with him and another found him 'sexy' in his uniform, the court heard.

Caroline Goodwin, defending, said that since being released from prison, the former officer has set up a business as a joiner, and tried to move on with his life, but has been held back by the claims.

'This has not been able to take place because he has been held back by the further offences hanging over him like the sword of Damocles,' he said.

Behind bars: Speaking today, Recorder Jonathan Carroll said Kershaw (pictured) had targeted at least two of his victims for their vulnerability

'Clearly he was convicted in the name of Rackham and tried to make a fresh start and so the opportunity to move on again and forward is going to be the rug pulled from underneath his feet. 

'It’s all very unhappily part and parcel of the same course of conduct. These were individuals who came across the defendant in his line of work. The defendant was dealing with these individuals as part and parcel of his job. 

'This is not someone who has been trawling the internet. This is someone who in a very privileged role as a police officer, came into contact with these individuals.'

Sentencing Kershaw, Recorder Jonathan Carroll said at least two of the former policeman's victims had been targeted for their vulnerability.

He told Kershaw: 'You targeted them and preyed upon them knowing they were highly vulnerable individuals. You used your uniform and police car to give authority to your presence.'

He added: 'The vast majority of us are taught from an early age that if you are in danger, difficulty or in trouble, we should turn to a police officer to go and get help. 

'Policing is conducted by consent and that consent depends entirely on trust. It’s your conduct and conduct of this type that drives a complete coach and horses through that trust, destroying the relationship between police and the people they seek to serve.'

Speaking after the case, Humberside Police Detective Superintendent Mathew Hutchinson said Kershaw 'abused the trust that was placed in him as a police officer' by committing 'a number of very serious offences'.

He added: 'I would like to praise the victims for their bravery. Coming forward to report allegations such as these can be extraordinarily difficult and these women have demonstrated real tenacity and courage.'
