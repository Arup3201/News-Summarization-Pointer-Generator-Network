Chelsea could be set to be the dominant force at the top of the Premier League for years to come if the club's youngsters fulfill the promise they are currently showing.

Alex Kiwomya - nephew of former Arsenal and Ipswich striker Chris - smashed home a sensational volley on Tuesday as Chelsea Under 21s beat their Norwich counterparts 5-0 in the Premier League International Cup.

Kiwomya unleashed a ferocious strike that flew past the Norwich keeper before he could even set himself to open the scoring in the first half after Jay Dasilva's pinpoint cross from the left.

The 18-year-old forward showed perfect technique and great athleticism as the ball rocketed off his right boot at lightning speed to set Chelsea on their way to a comprehensive victory.

The quality continued in the second half too, as Jeremie Boga curled a 25-yard free kick into the top corner with expert precision.

Boga stepped up to the ball with a short run-up before hitting a devilish strike that curled and dipped to make it 3-0 to Chelsea after Norwich defender Adel Gafaiti sliced Kiwomya’s cross into his own net.

Dominic Solanke added a brace late on to make the scoreline look even more convincing as Chelsea's next generation ended the year in style.
