Christmas jumpers, diet books and plastic surgery vouchers are among the least wanted festive gifts – but four in ten will fake joy when receiving them, a survey has found.

On average, we receive eight Christmas presents and hate two of them, even though they are worth £87.

Nationwide, that means a total of £4.4billion is wasted on 104million unwanted gifts. Men most dread receiving gaudy ties, ridiculous Christmas jumpers and cartoon socks.

Topping women’s list of unwanted presents are diet books, tacky ornaments and plastic surgery vouchers.

A quarter of the 2,000 adults surveyed admitted buying gifts they know the recipient will dislike.

The poll, which was carried out by lastminute.com, also revealed that what men and women most want is cash to spend on themselves, while 18 per cent would like a beach holiday.
