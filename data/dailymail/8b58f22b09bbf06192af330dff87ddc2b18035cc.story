An academy headmaster paid nearly £230,000 a year also raked in cash running a business based at the school.

Sir Greg Martin enjoyed a 56 per cent pay rise last year.

He is also sole director of a company which managed a health club and accommodation business on his school’s site and his ex-wife is the school’s deputy head.

A probe by the National Audit Office found Sir Greg’s firm was paid £508,000 in management fees over the past three years alone. 

Sir Greg Martin (pictured), headteacher of Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, enjoyed a 56 per cent pay rise last year, taking his total pay package up to just under £230,000 including pension contributions

Investigators were unable to determine the extent to which he benefited from the arrangement, which the Department for Education has now ended.

The NAO said Sir Greg ‘received payments in the form of director’s remuneration and/or dividends’ on top of his headteacher’s pay.

Now the Education Funding Agency, an arm of the DfE which policies academies, ‘is planning to undertake a review of academy heads’ salaries’.

In a report published today the NAO reveals Sir Greg was handed a pay rise of 56.5 per cent in 2012/13, taking his pay package to £229,138 including pension contributions. This made him ‘one of the highest paid executive heads in the country’.

Yet earlier this year Ofsted downgraded his school – Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London – from ‘outstanding’ to ‘good’.

The report also reveals that for nearly two years the day-to-day running of the school has been delegated to Sir Greg’s ex-wife, Nathalie Parker, who earned a salary of between £115,000 and £120,000.

NAO investigators found a ‘complex’ structure had grown up around Durand Academy and organisations linked to it.

They uncovered evidence of a ‘large number of conflicts of interest in the way that it managed its academy and its assets’.

Sir Greg (pictured) employed his ex-wife at the school, who earned a salary of between £115,000 and £120,000

These included a contract with a lobbying and public relations firm – PLMR – whose managing director, Kevin Craig, is the school’s vice-chairman of governors.

Payments totalling £583,000 were made to PLMR over three years.

Durand Academy recently became the first state primary to open its own secondary boarding school.

Pupils aged 13 to 18 are bussed to a mock Tudor mansion in Stedham, West Sussex, each week for an ‘Eton-style experience’.

The NAO said it had been told of ‘value for money concerns about the boarding school’, which is being backed by the Government to the tune of £17.34million.

Sir Greg – who was knighted for services to education in last year’s Queens Birthday Honours – married Miss Parker in May 1996. The pair, who have two sons together, divorced three years later.

Miss Parker was appointed acting head at Durand in September 2012. The NAO report said Miss Parker ‘was appointed through an externally advertised, competitive process and Sir Greg was not on the panel that appointed her’.

It also emerged that Sir Greg received an unspecified sum for running a leisure and accommodation business at the school. The non-profit London Horizons business – a gym, health spa and flats – generates income which is ploughed back into the school.

London Horizons has paid GMG, a firm of which Sir Greg is listed as the sole director, for running the business for more than a decade.

Between 2011 and 2014, £508,000 was paid in management fees from London Horizons to GMG.

After scrutinising Durand’s accounts, the EFA earlier this year ordered the academy to terminate the contract with GMG due to the risk of a ‘conflict of interest’.

Research by the EFA suggests contracts at 17 academy trusts in 2012/13 were improper or irregular. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It just feels wrong that individuals sitting on the board of the Durand Academy Trust could set up such a complex web of organisations and companies some of which are selling goods and services to the academy.

‘It’s not at all clear if individuals within the trust were improperly benefiting from these companies.’

A spokesman for Durand Academy Trust said: ‘Sir Greg has a hugely demanding role and he has always innovated. We are privileged to retain the services of such a dedicated education leader.’
