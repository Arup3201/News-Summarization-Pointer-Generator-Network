Rand Paul has continued to smear former President Bill Clinton by calling him a 'serial philanderer' that was a threat to women in the workplace as a result of his extra marital affairs.

Today's appearance on CBS This Morning was just the latest interview where he was asked about comments originally made by his wife Kelly in a Vogue spread that ran this September.

'The only reason I'm bringing it up is because people keep asking me and if you ask me a question then I'll most likely answer the question,' he said on CBS.Â

Bringing up the past: Senator Rand Paul now called former President 'a serial philanderer' which comes in contrast to how he said the Democrats consider him 'the greatest thing since sliced bread'

'There's been a lot of talk of a war on women and I am very concerned that women be treated equally and fairly in the workplace and one of the worst things that can happen is if your boss takes advantage of you in the workplace so really, for all these people who stand up for Bill Clinton who say he was the greatest thing since sliced bread- he was a serial philanderer but he also was someone who took advantage of women in the workplace and that's an old fashioned thing from a long time ago.'

The Republican Senator's thoughts on the former President's affairs is being given more airtime recently because he is widely considered to be one of the top prospects for his party's presidential nominee in 2016.

If that is the case, he will likely be facing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is in the front-runner position for the Democratic nomination, meaning that they may be competing for the same job.

When asked what his accusations of Mr Clinton had to do with Mrs Clinton, he said 'it's hard to separate them'.

Denial: Bill Clinton infamously claimed he never had sex with 20-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky

'It's not her fault. She's had to tolerate the same sort of problems from him, I guess, over time.

'It's more a question of the entire Democratic Party who says there's a war on women and that somehow the other party's committing this and yet they support and defend a guy who really in the workplace was doing something inexcusable, should not be tolerated.

'So really there's a question of hypocrisy and I think people don't like hypocrisy.'

This is not the first time of late that Paul has been questioned about the issue, and it seems the subject has come up in every interview he has given in the past week beginning with Meet the Press on Sunday where he called the former President as displaying 'predatory behavior'.

Still together: Senator Paul said that while the former President's philandering ways were not the 'fault' of Hillary, he said that it was 'hard to separate' the husband and wife duo (seen here on New Year's Day)

'He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his 
office. There is no excuse for that,' Paul said during the NBC show.

In spite of Paul's effort to bring the former President's philandering ways back to the forefront, it hasn't had too much of an effect in his standing in the polls.

Real Clear Politics averaged out the results from CNN, Quinnipiac, Public Policy and McClathy polls matching the former Secretary of state and the current Senator from Kentucky, and Mrs Clinton ended up winning by 10.2 points.
