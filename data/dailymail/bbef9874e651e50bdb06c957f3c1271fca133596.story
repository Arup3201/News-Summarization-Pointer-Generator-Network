Google is under pressure to change its translation tool after it emerged it automatically replaces the word 'gay' with homophobic slurs like 'f****t', 'poof', 'queen' and 'fairy'.

More than 50,000 people have have signed a petition demanding the U.S. web giant re-programmes its translate system, which is used by 500million people every month. 

When translating 'gay' from English into Spanish, French or Portuguese Google Translate comes back with 'f****t,' 'poof,' 'fairy' and 'dyke' as synonyms.

Google has apologised and said it is working to fix the problem, but MailOnline can reveal the translate system is still bringing up hateful words.

Offensive: The Google Translate tool, used by 500million people a month, brings up 'poof', 'queen' and 'f*****t' when translating 'gay' from English to other languages

Still happening: Google has said it is working to 'fix the issue' but MailOnline has found that translating gay from Greek to English still brings up these offensive terms

Campaigners from equality group All Out made the shocking discovery that Google was using hateful insults instead of neutral language for 'gay'. 

When the Russian word for 'gay' is translated into English, some of the results thrown up include 'pansy boy', 'fairy' and 'sodomite.' 

The petition website says: 'Imagine learning English and being taught to say hateful insults instead of neutral language for 'gay'. 

'Google Translate - used by over 500 million people every month - was suggesting slurs as synonyms for the word 'gay'.

'Thousands of us signed the urgent petition and Google heard us. This is how powerful we are when we stand together'. 

Google has confirmed they were aware of the offensive translation and are trying to fix the issue. They have also said sorry.

Outrage: More than 50,000 people have signed this petition demanding that Google reprogramme the online tool

A spokesman said: 'As soon as we were informed that some of our translations for certain terms were serving inappropriate results, we immediately began working to fix the issue.

'We apologise for any offence this has caused people.

'Our systems produce translations automatically based on existing translations on the web, so we appreciate when users point out issues such as this.'

Gay rights group Stonewall have said the translation tool has revealed how much of a problem homophobic language is.

A spokesman said: ‘This demonstrates how commonly offensive slur words are used online to describe lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. 

This is indicative of how much of a problem homophobic language is, and we hope it encourages others to stand up against it next time they see it or hear it. We're glad Google has apologised and is working on a fix.’
