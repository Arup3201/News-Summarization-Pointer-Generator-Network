Southwest Airlines pilots who recently landed at the wrong airport in Missouri have told investigators they were confused by the small airport's runway lights, believing it to be a larger airport in nearby Branson, the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.

The pilots of Southwest Flight 4013 from Chicago's Midway Airport said in interviews with investigators that they had programmed the Boeing 737 flight management system for the Branson airport, NTSB said.

But as they were approaching to land at night last Sunday, they first saw the airport beacon and bright runway lights of Graham Clark Downtown Airport, located in Hollister, Missouri, and mistakenly identified it as the Branson airport, which is 7 miles away.

Uncommon around these parts: A small crowd gathers at the M. Graham Clark Airport in Hollister, Missouri Monday to see Southwest Airlines jet that landed there by mistake. The pilots who mistakenly landed the jet there Sunday were grounded Monday pending an investigation

Whoops: Pictured is the flight path of Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 on Sunday. The flight, carrying 124 passengers and five crew members, was scheduled to go from Chicago's Midway International Airport to Branson Airport but somehow veered 9 miles off course

The captain had not previously landed 
in Branson, and the first officer had previously landed there once, and 
that was during the daytime, NTSB said in an update on the incident. 
They didn't realize until the plane touched down that they were at the 
wrong airport, the NTSB said.

During
 the landing approach, the pilots contacted the Branson control tower. 
They were told by controllers they were 15 miles from their target. But 
the pilots responded that they had the airfield in sight. Controllers 
then cleared the plane for a visual approach to land on Branson runway 
14. That means the pilots were relying on what they could see rather 
than automation to orient the plane.

Instead,
 the midsized airliner with 124 passengers on board landed on the 
Downtown Airport runway, which is half as long as the Branson runway. 
The runways are oriented in a similar direction. Passengers later 
described the plane coming to an extremely hard stop just short of a 
ravine at the end of the runway, and the smell of burnt rubber.

NTSB said the pilots 'confirmed that they utilized heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop.'

Besides
 the pilots, NTSB said investigators also interviewed a Southwest 
dispatcher, who was on the flight, riding in the jump seat, and listened
 to the cockpit voice recorder. Investigators have also begun to analyze
 the plane's flight data recorder, which contains about 27 hours of 
recorded data from the jet's computer systems.

Welcome to Branson? Confused passengers were first told by a crew member they'd landed at the correct destination. A pilot then spoke on the intercom: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you we landed at the wrong airport

Wrong runway:  Flight 4013 from Chicago landed at Taney County Airport instead of Branson Airport. The Boeing 737-700 carried 124 passengers and a crew of five

Delay: After a five hour delay, passengers were bussed to the correct airport and re-boarded the plane to continue their journey

The
 captain has been with Southwest since 1999 and has about 16,000 flight 
hours, including about 6,700 hours as a captain on the 737. The first 
officer has been with Southwest since 2001 and has about 25,000 flight 
hours.

Instances of 
commercial jets landing at the wrong airport are unusual, but not 
unheard of, according to pilots and aviation safety experts. Usually the
 pilots are flying a visual approach in clear weather.

The
 instances also typically involve low-traffic airports situated close 
together with runways aligned to the same or similar compass points.

We've arrived: The Southwest Airlines jet landed at an airport nine miles away from where it should have been

The incident in Missouri is the second time in two months that a large jet has landed at the wrong airport.

In
 November, a freight-carrying Boeing 747 that was supposed to deliver 
parts to McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kan., landed nine miles 
north at Col. James Jabara Airport.

The company that operated the flight
 later said in a training video that the crew was skeptical about the 
plane's automation after the co-pilot's flight display had intermittent 
trouble, and the pilot chose to fly visually when he spotted the 
brightly lit runway at Jabara.

Last
 year, a cargo plane bound for MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Fla., 
landed without incident at the small Peter O. Knight Airport nearby. An 
investigation blamed confusion identifying airports in the area, and 
base officials introduced an updated landing procedure.

Where they landed: The jet landed at Taney Airport. The runway is half the length of the one at Branson airport

So near, yet so far: Branson Airport (pictured) is where the plane was supposed to have landed

The M. Graham Clark Airport started as a dirt runway in the late 1960s. The longest of the two asphalt runways there is 3,738 feet.. At the commercial Branson airport, the concrete runway is more than 7,000 feet in length.

In December, Southwest Airlines announced it will cease operations at the Branson Airport in June after serving the airport for about 15 months.
