Alastair Cook wants England to get on top of their problems with spin after India took a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five one-day series.

England started well and got to 82 for no loss, before crumbling to 227 all out.

Spin accounted for six of their wickets, having done for seven of them in defeat in Cardiff earlier in the week.

Sort it out! Alastair Cook wants England to get on top of their problems with spin after India took a 2-0 lead

Frustrated: England started well and got to 82 for no loss, before crumbling to 227 all out against India

'We got off to another good start, 80 for none, and we expected to make more,' Cook said on Sky Sports 2.

'(Spin) is something we need to keep trying to work on, we're not doing it right.

'I think the ball spinned off the pitch more in the morning than it did in the afternoon but I still don't think it was a 230 pitch.

'We need to keep working because if we don't we will keep not getting enough.'

India were then able to knock the runs off with six wickets to spare, with England not having the same weapons in their own spin department.

'We are trying to find the quality spinners,' Cook added. 'India are blessed with a lot of quality.

'I didn't think Trent Bridge would spin as much as it did but you have to adjust to that.

'The bottom line is we didn't play very well with the bat.' 

Stumped: Cook says England 'need to keep working because if we don't we will keep not getting enough'
