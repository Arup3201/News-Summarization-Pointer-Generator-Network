Deputy mayor: Councillor David Thomas has blamed the Police Federation for Torbay Council's coin toss

Councillors in a seaside resort could not decide whether to allow takeaways in a children's park - so they tossed a coin.

Members of Torbay Council voted to ban fast food businesses from Cary Park in Torquay, Devon, after the coin landed on heads instead of tails.

They have blamed their controversial voting method on the Police Federation, which elected its new leader on a 50/50 spin just weeks ago.

Steve White, a former firearms officer, took the helm of the national organisation after a split in the ranks over his appointment was settled by the flip of a coin.

Now, Torbay Council's deputy mayor David Thomas, who chairs its place policy development group, has defended its decision to do the same.

'I opted to use a random method of decision, which was a toss of a coin,' he said.

'If
 you look at election law in a local or general election if the vote is 
an even split - say 5,000 and 5,000 - the decision has to be made by the
 presiding officer.

'They have to decide any method they choose.

'They can toss a coin or use a short straw or put candidates’ names in a hat and the one pulled out is counted as an extra vote. That’s a valid and legal way of deciding an election.

'Only two months ago the Police Federation of Great Britain appointed its chairman by the toss of a coin.

'I
 thought in my infinite wisdom as a lowly councillor in Torbay that if 
this was good enough for the Police Federation and if it is good enough 
to decide on an MP it was good enough for Torbay Council.'

Angry: Today, the council's method of voting was condemned by caterer Claire Hall (pictured), who operated her Atomic Cafe at the park last summer. She said: 'It just seems like a game to them. I think it is  unprofessional'

Councillor Thomas said he had been unable to use his casting vote on what was a split decision because he had a personal interest in the issue, as the owner of his own mobile catering firm.

The four other councillors had been divided over the issue - with Steve Darling and Beryl McPhail against takeaways in the park, and Ken Pritchard and Jackie 
Stockman in favour of them.

As a last resort, council officer Charles Uzzell had tossed the coin at a private meeting of around 20 councillors, 15 of whom did not have the authority to vote.

They all watched as it landed on heads - meaning that no takeaways would be allowed in the park.

Their recommendation will now go to Torbay mayor, Gordon Oliver, who will make a final decision.

Cllr Thomas said: 'This decision is basically a recommendation to the mayor. It is his decision what he does. He can either listen to what was said or do something totally different.'

Today, the council's method of voting was condemned by caterer Claire Hall, who ran her Atomic Cafe at Cary Park last summer.

'It just seems like a game to them,' she said.  'I think it is very unprofessional and I feel completely disillusioned.

'This is no way to treat all the people who supported me last year who really want to see a facility there.'

Cllr
 Thomas said the decision to ban food takeaways from park was not aimed at individual businesses.

But he 
accepted that the vote - if rubber-stamped by the mayor - may ‘affect an 
individual business this year’.

Last
 year, Ms Hall secured a 200-signature petition to reinstate her 
airstream van at the park when her trading licence was revoked after her
 first few days of trading.

She said she was concerned about competition from Decoy Park in nearby Newton Abbot.

'Torbay will lose all its parents to Decoy Park with its facilities, toilets and play area,' she said.

'The council should think about providing a kiosk there with at least one toilet. It is an ideal spot.'

Councillor Darling, who voted against the proposal, said he did not think the coin toss had been a 'satisfactory way' of dealing with the matter.

'I understand where [Cllr Thomas] was coming from with a toss of a coin as 
it is legal, but it makes the council look ludicrous,' he said. 

Councillor Stockman agreed, saying: 'I think the chairman, knowing he had an interest
 and couldn’t make the decision if it was an even vote, should have 
handed over the chairmanship to another member of the committee for that
 item of the agenda only.

'Then
 no-one would have been put in the position of deciding something on the
 toss of a coin which is not a good way of making a decision on 
anything, least of all that.'

But Councillor Beryl McPhail said: 'It is not the most desirable way of dealing with 
things, but in these circumstances it seemed to be an acceptable way of 
resolving the situation.'

The Police Federation came under fire last month after electing its new leader on the flip a coin.

Former firearms officer Steve White was chosen to take the helm of the beleaguered organisation after a 50/50 split in the ranks over his appointment was settled on the toss.

His controversial election came just days after the scandal-hit police union was warned that it ‘must change or die'.

Addressing the Federation’s 
conference in Bournemouth last month, Theresa May accused officers of treating the public with 'contempt' over the way they treated victims of abuse and domestic violence. 

She also announced that she was scrapping all Police Federation 
funding this August because the organisation sits on 'vast reserves' of cash worth 
tens of millions of pounds.

The Home Secretary's intervention came as a fourth police officer was 
sacked over the Downing Street 'plebgate' row involving the former Tory 
Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell.

The Police Federation, which represents 126,000 rank-and-file policemen and women, has also been rocked by accusations of bullying and obsessive secrecy.

Speaking after Mrs May's attack, Mr White pledged to implement change, saying: 'This has been an historic week.

'We have been given a clear mandate to progress the reforms needed to better represent the hard-working police officers throughout England and Wales.'
