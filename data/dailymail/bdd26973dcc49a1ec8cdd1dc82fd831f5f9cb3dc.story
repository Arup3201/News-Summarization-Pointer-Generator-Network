Neither Quesenberry nor Miss Lewis have contacted relatives or friends since allegedly taking off together.

Virginia State Police have classified the 16-year-old's disappearance as an endangered missing person alert and believe she may be in danger of sexual exploitation.

Quesenberry has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

It is unclear if the pair have remained in the local area or left the state of Virginia. 

Police believe that Florida may be a possibility.  

According to a missing poster, Miss Lewis is 5'3' and weighs 160lbs. She has black hair with red highlights.

The parents of the 16-year-old (pictured) have asked the 33-year-old man who took her to 'drop her off in a safe place' 

She was last seen wearing light blue jeans, a navy blue t-shirt, a black fleece, and brown moccasin-style shoes.

Quesenberry was described as a white male with brown hair and brown eyes. He is 5'7' and weighs 195lb.

The girl's parents, Brandon Lewis and Teneara Dial, have asked Quesenberry to drop her off in a safe place.
