Recovering well: Hussein Benhaffaf, right, pictured with twin Hassan and parents Angie and Azzedine, needed a life saving operation

One of the conjoined twins dramatically separated in a high-risk operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital three years ago has survived further life-saving surgery.

Hussein and Hassan Benhaffaf had their liver, bladder, gut and intestine divided in February 2010 when they were just five months old, after being born conjoined from chest to pelvis.

Now Hussein has returned to the London hospital to undergo surgery for an incisional hernia, believed to have been caused by wounds from the first operation not fully healing.

Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday from Hussein’s bedside, his mother Angie Benhaffaf, 40, said: ‘It’s the first time since they were separated that I’ve absolutely feared I’d lose one of them.

'I worried that Hussein wasn’t going to live through that night. I was terrified.’

Hussein, who lives with his mother, his father Azzedine, 40, sisters Malika, nine, and Iman, six, and his twin Hassan in Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland, is now recovering well.

It was the little boy’s third procedure.

Hassan has had six since they were separated, including operations to help correct his scoliosis, a curvature of the spine.

Angie and her husband work as full-time carers to the twins.

She said: ‘Some days I wake up and feel that it’s all too much, too tough.

‘Then I remind myself that I have to be positive for my children.

'All we want now is for them to stay healthy and happy, and for one day to make whatever dreams they have come true.’

Angie learned that the twins she was carrying were conjoined at her 12-week scan.

She said: ‘To this day, I carry a photo of that first scan in my purse and whenever I look at it, it reminds me of how far the boys have come.’
