A horrifying video has been released showing dozens of corpses with their hands tied behind their backs lined up by a river in Syria.

The bodies of at least 65 males, apparently shot 
in the head, were found in a district of the
northern Syrian city of Aleppo earlier today.

Blood was seeping from their heads 
and some of them appeared to be young, possibly teenagers, dressed 
in jeans, shirts and trainers.Â 

A Free Syrian Army captain said that many more bodies were still being dragged from the water.

Massacre: A horrifying video has been released showing dozens of corpses with their hands bound behind their backs lined up by a river in Syria

Killed: Blood was seeping from their heads and some of them appeared to be young, possibly teenagers, and dressed in jeans, shirts and sneakers

Opposition activists posted a video of a man filming at least 51 muddied male bodies alongside what they said was the Queiq River in the rebel-held Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood of Aleppo.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which says it provides objective information about casualties on both sides of Syria's war from a network of monitors, said the death toll could rise as high as 80.

It was not clear who had carried out the killings.

The Queiq River rises in Turkey and travels through government-held districts of Aleppo before it reaches Bustan al-Qasr.

'They were killed only because they are Muslims,' said a bearded man in another video said to have been filmed in central Bustan al-Qasr after the bodies were removed from the river.

A pickup truck with a pile of corpses was parked behind him.

It is not clear who carried out the killings - human rights groups have accused both government forces and the rebels of carrying out summary executions.

Government forces and rebels in Syria have both been accused by human rights groups of carrying out summary executions in the 22-month-old conflict, which has claimed more than 60,000 lives.

Rebels pushed into Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, over the summer, but are stuck in a stalemate with government forces.

Storm: Syrian rebels stormed a government intelligence complex in the oil-rich east of the country on today, freeing at least 11 people held in a prison at the facility, activists said

The city is divided roughly in half between the two sides.

The revolt started as a peaceful protest movement against more than four decades of rule by President Bashar al-Assad and his family, but turned into an armed rebellion after a government crackdown.

More than 700,000 people have fled, the United Nations says.

After five days of heavy clashes around the intelligence compound in the city of Deir el-Zour, rebels finally overran the complex early Tuesday following intense fighting overnight, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Opposition figures were reportedly being held at the jail on the complex's grounds, but it was not immediately clear whether those freed Tuesday are fighters or activists.

Government forces responded to the rebel advance by unleashing a series of airstrikes on the compound, trying to push the opposition fighters from the facility.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said last month that government forces are shelling and bombing Deir el-Zour almost daily. It said tens of thousands of Syrians, many of them wounded, remain trapped in the city.

Also Tuesday, regime warplanes also carried several airstrikes on rebel positions in restive towns and villages around Damascus, including eastern Ghouta and Yalda, and hit other suburbs with artillery, the Observatory said.

The group relies on the reports from activists on the ground.

After capturing several major army bases and government outposts, the rebels control large swathes of land in northeastern Syria.

Assad's troops, however, continue to hold a tight grip on the capital after nearly two years of conflict.

The areas on the capital's doorstep have been rebel strongholds since early on in the revolt. In recent months, the rebels have used them as a base from which they have been trying to push into central Damascus, the seat of Assad's power.
