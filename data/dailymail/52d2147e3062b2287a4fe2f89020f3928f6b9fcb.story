Chelsea remain confident that they will secure the signature of Loic Remy despite Arsenal's dramatic intervention on Saturday night by matching their £8million bid.

Remy's representatives were already in talks with Chelsea and the deal is in its advanced stages.

The price of the transfer fee is not in dispute as Remy has a fixed clause in his contract to leave to join a Champions League team.

Adios: Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has agreed a loan move to AC Milan on a two-year deal

Chelsea became aware of Arsenal's interest late on Saturday but feel they have done enough to tie up the deal, having started talks in earnest on Friday once Fernando Torres joined AC Milan on loan.

However, Arsenal's immediate need for a striker is more pressing.

Given the injury to Olivier Giroud and Arsenal will hope that being a compatriot, Arsene Wenger will be able to persuade Remy he will have more first-team football at Arsenal given that Chelsea's first choice striker will clearly be Diego Costa.

Form: Remy scored an impressive 14 goals in 26 league games during a loan spell at Newcastle last season

Versatile: France international Remy would give both clubs options both at central striker and in wide channels
