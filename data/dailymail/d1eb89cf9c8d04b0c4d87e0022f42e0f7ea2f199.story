Defeat was just a few minutes old and the emotions came
hustling in, wave upon wave. There was disillusion, despair, bewilderment and
weary resignation. On the face of Roy Hodgson, you could read the entire,
distressful history of England at the World Cup.

The old ones will recall those expressions flickering across
the frosty features of Sir Alf Ramsey in Mexico 1970. In turn, the same
emotions were to visit men like Ron Greenwood, Sir Bobby Robson, Glenn Hoddle,
Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. Humble pie became their staple diet, for
all were ultimately confronted by the reality that the world will not buy what
England has to offer.

Haunted: Roy Hodgson is the latest England manager to have reality check

The plot never changes. It follows a seemingly predestined
course and ends not with a bang but a whimper. Having studied the sobering
process for so long, even England's travelling followers have finally modified
their expectations. A great deal of hard currency crossed the bars of Sao Paulo
the other evening in return for a torrent of strong lager. Yet, thankfully, little
damage was done to people or property. For disappointment was muted, the
history lessons had been slowly digested.

Yet still, in those first, vulnerable moments, Hodgson
seemed devastated. For he had worked unsparingly at his task. Preparations had
been expensively perfect, the camp was happy and hopeful and raw promise seemed
to be delivering heartening performance. After so much concentrated effort, the
manager had allowed himself to believe the words of that terrible old World Cup
song: 'This time, we'll get it right.' And they didn't. As Greenwood, Robson
and the rest could testify, they never do.

This time, in fact, the errors arrived in clusters and the
culprits formed a long, disorderly queue. Steven Gerrard performed like a
Steven Gerrard tribute act, enduring a nightmare of hapless imprecision.
Leighton Baines was similarly culpable, while charity insists that we do not
mention the defensive efforts of Phil Jagielka. All this and Joe Hart turning
in the kind of display which confirmed the growing reservations about his
general competence. As a former Premier League manager confided after the
match: 'The truth is, England don't have a defence.'

Forward planning: Roy Hodgson is expected to stay on as England boss

One bizarrely popular response was to blame the absence of
John Terry. Yes, that John Terry. All would have been well, it seems, had we
pleaded with the man who was properly stripped of the England captaincy for the
vile abuse he screeched at Anton Ferdinand and who later rejected international
football. You may recall the almighty chasing he received in Bloemfontein at
the last World Cup finals on the day that Germany put four past England. The
notion of a return to Terry is both frivolous and demeaning.

Then there is the matter of the manager. Once again, knees
jerk and sanity is suspended.

'Sack him!' screams the pack. 'He's got to go',
bawl the hunt followers. While a prominent bookies' runner, shamelessly
inciting mug punters, offered 9-4 that Hodgson is no longer manager of England
come September: 'It would appear that tactics, team selection and motivation
are things potentially lacking in Hodgson's armoury,' drivelled the impertinent
huckster. Already, the pursuit  carries the whiff of the lynch mob.

Now clearly, Hodgson has made errors. The omission of Ashley
Cole was a decision he will surely regret. Cole may no longer be the surging
athlete of old but he would have proved a more effective defender than the
struggling Baines. And the selection of Frank Lampard remains difficult to
comprehend. Lampard has yet to kick a ball in this World Cup. If he is again
ignored for Tuesday's irrelevant scuffle with Costa Rica, then the public may
deserve an explanation for his presence in the squad. And if England's young
pretenders really did freeze for the crucial match with Uruguay -  having
bloomed so bravely against Italy - then we are entitled to ask how it happened
and why it was not foreseen.

But Hodgson is a football manager; he is not an alchemist.
England's performances are governed by the number and quality of the
players at his disposal. It is scarcely the manager's fault that the numbers
are so small and the quality so tepid that he is forced to send out
Jagielka  and Gary Cahill as the country's unchallenged central
defensive alliance.  Sacking the manager would represent a failure
of the imagination, a placatory bone tossed to the chasing hounds.

On the ball: Hodgson has to learn from the mistakes he made at World Cup

Yet there were fears that the Football Association chairman
Greg Dyke might stoop to a populist gesture. After all, his last notable
gesture - that embarrassing throat-slitting charade at the World Cup draw -
proved a remarkably accurate prophecy. Fortunately, Dyke has recognised the
futility of abandoning Hodgson at this stage and has announced his support of
the manager through to 2016.

His next step, of course, should involve an outright
confrontation with the Premier League, who were created with the boldly
declared and palpably fraudulent aim of improving the national side. Already,
Dyke has asked the central question: 'If your top league is largely foreign-
owned with foreign managers, why should those in control care about developing
the England team?' But his subsequent attempts to address the problem have been
incoherent and unconvincing. Quite possibly he is hopelessly handicapped by his
past.

As a prominent television executive in the early Nineties,
Dyke played a crucial role in the League's formation. The consequence of his
pioneering efforts could be seen in the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo, on
Thursday evening. At such times, English football treads a well-worn path.
After the initial shock and the subsequent eruption of public anger, those
charged with running the game wring their hands, shake their heads and solemnly
promise that this affront to our national dignity must never be allowed to
happen again. Then the new season arrives, fresh millions are expended on
new  foreign recruits and we return to our usual orgy of Super Sundays and
Magic Mondays. And the nation  forgets how it felt to be humiliated with
the whole world watching and sniggering.

One man at least will never forget. The merest glance at
that crumpled face told us how savagely he was suffering. Hodgson had
entertained high hopes that he might break the mould at this World Cup, that he
might achieve something quite dramatic with his young, striving, adventurous
players. But old habits die hard. Success is reserved for better, more
deserving football teams. And within the space of two unhappy matches, Roy
Hodgson has joined the ranks of Greenwood, Robson, Hoddle and the rest.

All gifted men, all fine football managers. And all victims
of the English disease.

P.S

As English football takes its early bath, the search for
scapegoats begins in earnest. The suspects so far include the manager, the
coaches, the media, the defence, the strikers, the pitches and the weather. And
yet, the most culpable candidate by far has slipped clean away. He is an
orthopaedic surgeon at the Medica Uruguaya hospital in Montevideo. On May 22,
this gentleman was required to repair part of a meniscus cartilage in the knee
of a celebrated athlete. He did his job with such disobliging brilliance that
his patient (pictured above) felt able to play international football precisely four
weeks later. And the rest, as they say…
