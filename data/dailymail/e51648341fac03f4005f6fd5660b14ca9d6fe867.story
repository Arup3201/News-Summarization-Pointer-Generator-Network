After some of the worst weeks of his leadership, he may have hoped that taking on a former pop singer in a TV debate would provide a welcome boost.

But Ed Miliband was left humiliated last night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Myleene Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax.

The party leader looked lost and bewildered as the former Hear'Say singer tore strips out of his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million.

Today Mr Miliband tried to laugh the row off, writing on Twitter that the NHS needs a mansion tax 'Pure and Simple' - a reference to Hear'Say's biggest hit song.

TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister.

Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘For me, it’s so disturbing – the name in its own right: “mansion tax”.

'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It’s like a garage.

‘When you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax, it’s true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time. 

'The people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £140million, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they’ve got their tax rebates and amazing accountants. It’s going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years.’

Mr Miliband responded: ‘I totally understand that people don’t like paying more in tax. The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.’

Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.'

But former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer joined in the debate and angrily told Mr Miliband: ‘You’re going to screw me royally.’ 

Host Tom Bradby tried to calm things down, saying: ‘Ed’s getting a bit isolated here.’

But Miss Klass, 36, interrupted: ‘Ed’s getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work.’

Getting more frustrated, she added: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.

‘You need to have a better strategy and say why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?’ The confrontation immediately started trending on Twitter.

Miss Klass sold her former marital home last year for £1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage

Myleene and Ed enjoyed a quick drink with the other panel members and presenter Tom Bradby last night

Scott Reid tweeted: ‘You know it’s gone truly surreal when Myleene Klass goes full Paxman on Miliband.’

 Edward Mayes wrote: ‘Ed Miliband is currently being schooled by Myleene Klass on his mansion tax policy. That political heavyweight.’

Caron Lindsay added: ‘Myleene Klass is wiping the floor with Ed Miliband on The Agenda – he could be making case so much better.’

Another user wrote: ‘Ed Miliband says he’ll take on terrorists, two minutes later he loses an argument to Myleene Klass.’ 

Miss Klass sold her former marital home last year for £1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage. 

She currently lives with her daughters in a rented home in Highgate, north London, that is worth around £3 million.

If she chooses to buy a house in future it is likely to fall into any mansion tax bracket that would be introduced by Labour.

Miss Klass was a member of the pop band Hear'Say, which was formed by the ITV show Popstars in 2001

Ed Miliband admitted he has problems with photo opportunities, and suggested Kim Kardashian could help him improve his image.

The Labour leader has insisted that the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich.

He has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t-shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in Manchester.

Appearing on ITV's Agenda last night, Mr Miliband held up a spoof newspaper front page, with the headline: 'Em plays the Kim Kard.'

It was a reference to Kim Kardashian's expertise at the photo opportunity, and the extraordinary pictures released last week in which she posed naked on the front of Paper magazine, under the headline 'Break the internet'. The images sparked countless spoofs online. 

Explaining his front page, Mr Miliband said: 'You'll know she ‘broke’ the internet this week with a risque photo opportunity. 

'Now all politicians have problems with photo opportunities, me more than most, so I have decided to hire Kim to help me with the photo opportunities.'

Myleene says you can only buy a garage for £2million – in fact it's a sprawling mansion with an indoor swimming pool and a sweeping drive

Myleene Klass joked last night that in some parts of London buying a property sitting above the proposed £2million Mansion Tax limit would probably only stretch to a garage.

But in fact it can stretch to a mansion  and outside the capital something even grander.

However, the singer is right about garages, because last month one went up for sale for an eye-watering £550,000. 

Overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. 

This is what £2million can buy you: 

Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million.

In Islington a four-bedroom terraced property was on sale for £2,000,000. A similar house on the same street sold for £430,000 in 1999, and is now estimated to be worth £2,036,764.  Conservative MP Greg Hands said: 'Elderly people would find it impossible to pay amounts of up to £30,000 per annum to live in their family home which in many cases they have been in for 30 years or more.'

A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. There are also fears that, if the tax is introduced, the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting Government revenue.

Just outside Glasgow, a four-bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £2,100,000. The property, which was completely rebuilt in 1999, boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design. Other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year.

In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value.

This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966.

A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost.

Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax.

A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry.

And for £550,000....
