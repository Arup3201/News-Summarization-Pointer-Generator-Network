Sir Alex Ferguson spent time with the European Ryder Cup caddies before his motivational speech to Paul McGinley's players at Gleneagles on Tuesday night.

The chat included Fergie telling big Leeds United fan Billy Foster, bag man for Lee Westwood, that he had taken 17 players from Elland Road during his reign at Manchester United.

McGinley said: 'Billy Foster right now is a big Leeds United fan and I think Sir Alex said to him that he got 17 players from Leeds to end up at Man Utd and that bit hard when Billy had a go.

'Billy let him know what he thought in no uncertain terms. I think the caddies enjoyed he was standing up to Alex Ferguson in this room full of all his peers.

'It was just a bit of banter and in fairness to Sir Alex, he's used to this. He's in the dressing room and he's in that banter all the time. This was very normal for him.

'But the biggest stick was Thomas Bjorn being a Liverpool fan and a lot of stick to Ian Poulter for being a big Arsenal fan.'
