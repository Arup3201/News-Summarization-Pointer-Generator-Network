When nine-month pregnant Holly Cross felt a sudden and searing pain in her stomach, she thought she was going into labour.

The 23-year-old described feeling 'something burst', just days before her second child was due.

She was rushed to hospital where doctors performed an emergency Caesarean section.

But as well as delivering her son, doctors discovered a 10-inch cyst attached to one of Mrs Cross' ovaries had popped, causing the agonising pain.

Holly Cross was nine months pregnant when she felt something burst inside her stomach. The 23-year-old thought she had gone into labour and rushed to hospital where doctors found a cyst attached to her ovary had burst

Tests revealed the cyst, found during a C-section as doctors delivered her second son Joshua, pictured left, was cancerous. Mrs Cross is pictured with her older son Liam, right

Tests carried out on the cyst revealed the mother-of-two had ovarian cancer.

Terrified she would die, leaving her husband Ray, 24, to bring up their sons alone, Mrs Cross opted to have a full hysterectomy, to try and rid her of the cancer.

‘I was devastated when I was told I had cancer, I thought I was going to die,’ she told MailOnline.

The mother-of-two, from Chatham in Kent, had been at home with her husband and their three-year-old son Liam, in September 2013, when she complained of feeling sick from the pregnancy.

‘I wanted the baby to be born so I could get on with feeling normal again and enjoy family life,’ Mrs Cross, said.

‘Then I felt a popping sensation and a piercing pain in my stomach.

‘I was doubled up in pain and thought I was having a heart attack and was convinced I was going to die.’

She was rushed to Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, where doctors monitored her baby.

They found its heart rate had dropped so Mrs Cross was taken to theatre for an emergency C-section.

Baby Joshua was delivered safely, weighing 7lbs, 13oz.

‘When I came round doctors told me they’d found a cyst and had taken a biopsy to run tests,' she told MailOnline.

'In the meantime I could go home. I was stunned, but it hadn’t sunk in that it could be cancer. I was too busy embracing my new role as a mum-of-two.

Mrs Cross, pictured with Liam after the birth of Joshua, believes her unborn son wriggling around caused the cyst to burst. She said: 'I believe had it not been for my baby, Joshua, wriggling around, which I think caused the cyst to burst, it could have continued to grow and the cancer could have spread'

Around one in every 50 women in the UK develops ovarian cancer during her lifetime.

While the causes are not yet completely understood, the risk of developing ovarian cancer is very low in young women, the risk increasing with age.

More than 80 per cent of cases occur in women over the age of 50.

Most ovarian cancers start in the cells that cover the surface of the ovary. 

Symptoms of the disease include:

Because the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be mistaken for symptoms of other non-cancerous conditions, there can often be a delay in diagnosis.

Health bosses advise that if a woman has suffered bloating, feeling full, pain or discomfort in the lower tummy and needing to pass urine more often or more urgently for more than a month, they should see a GP straight away.

‘A week later the results showed I had cancer. Nobody knew how long the cyst had been growing.

‘In a way I was lucky to be pregnant as I hadn’t had any symptoms that would have made me aware I had ovarian cancer.

‘I believe had it not been for my baby, Joshua, wriggling around, which I think caused the cyst to burst, it could have continued to grow and the cancer could have spread.

‘It’s popping made the doctors aware of it, which saved my life.’

The paramedics, who arrived at the couple's house, told Mrs Cross the pains were contractions and that she had gone into labour.

‘But I knew they were a lot worse than that,’ she said.

‘I was struggling to breathe. I thought I was having a heart attack. As I held my stomach, it felt as hard as rock.

‘I remember Liam tried to comfort me by rubbing my back and saying, "Mummy, are you OK?".'

She added: ‘The pain I had been in wasn’t from labour pains but the cyst bursting.’

‘I was told that cysts were quite common during pregnancy so I thought everything was going to be alright and all I had to do was recover from my caesarean.’

However, a week later, Mrs Cross received a phone call from the hospital asking to come back in to see doctors.

There, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

Doctors gave her the option of having the ovary affected removed, or a full hysterectomy to make sure the cancer did not spread.

The latter would cause Mrs Cross to experience the menopause, at the age of just 22.

Terrified she would die, leaving her husband Ray, 24, pictured, to bring up their sons, Liam and Joshua,  alone, Mrs Cross opted to have a full hysterectomy, to try and rid her of the cancer

‘I was devastated at first but I decided I’d had my two boys and didn’t want there being any chance the cancer could come back,' she said.

'I wanted to see my boys grow up. I was prepared to do anything for my family.'

On November 6, 2013, Mrs Cross had the procedure, with surgeons removing her womb, cervix, lymph nodes, appendix and both ovaries.

After suffering an infection, the mother-of-two was kept in hospital for a further month.

She said: ‘One week I was in hospital I felt so ill I asked Ray not to bring the boys in to see me.

'I didn’t want Liam to see me in pain again. He’d been so upset the time the cyst had burst.

‘During those weeks I was in hospital I felt like I didn’t get the chance to bond with my new baby boy.

'When I was allowed home I realised he’d changed so much and I’d missed that.’

Mrs Cross was told the cyst contained fluid and cancerous cells, that could have leaked causing the cancer to spread.

In January 2014 she began chemotherapy.

‘I was grateful I had a lot of help with the boys and I came home and played with them when I could,’ she told MailOnline.

‘I said yes to everything Liam wanted to do because I knew that a week later I could be feeling too tired to do anything with him. So we went to the park, the zoo, the farm, activity centres.’

The mother-of-two underwent chemotherapy and has since been given the all-clear from cancer. She is raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support to help others facing the disease

Mrs Cross, who lost her hair during chemotherapy, didn’t want her sons to see her bald, so she wore wigs to cover it.

She completed her chemotherapy in May this year and her hair started to grow back straight away, marking the end of her battle with cancer.

Earlier this year, Mrs Cross decided she wanted to help others facing cancer by raising money for the cancer charity, Macmillan Cancer Support.

‘Because my stomach was still sore, following the caesarean and hysterectomy, I knew a running event could potentially put a strain on my wounds,’ she said.

‘Then I heard about the Great London Swim, taking place on August 30, so I suggested to Ray we could take part, and we began to train for it.

‘I found being in the water relaxing and I could spend time with our boys in the pool too.’

Mrs Cross has now been given the all clear but will continue to have regular check-ups.

She said: ‘Finally I’m getting to put the past behind me, and make up for lost time with my boys. They’re all that matter to me.’
