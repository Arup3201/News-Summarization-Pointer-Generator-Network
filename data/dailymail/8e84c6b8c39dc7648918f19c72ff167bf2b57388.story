A homeless woman who was living out of an SUV for weeks with her three children and two grandchildren recently got a big helping hand from a group of concerned Minnesota police.

Kim Washington was a woman in a desperate situation. When her relationship in Florida turned violent, she packed up her kids and drove to her Twin Cities hometown.

When she got there, she found nowhere for them to stay and bad turned to worse. She thought things were getting even more desperate when police started coming around.

Desperate situation: Complaint calls poured in from area residents as days the family spent in the vehicle turned to weeks

Even she was shocked at how kind the officers were to her and her family.

'I was very leery of them,' Washington admitted to KMSP. 'Every time I saw them I was like, "Oh Lord, here they come to harass us." [But] a lot of them were kind, empathetic, and they understood. I appreciate them.'

According to the Pioneer Press, some of the officers would drop by with pizza for the family and books for the 1- and 2-year-old grandchildren.

'It made an awesome difference,' Washington said. 'You don't feel so invisible.'

Meanwhile, as the time Washington, her three, 12-,  20-year-old children and her grandkids spent in the SUV stretched from days to weeks, officers began getting more complaints from residents of the St. Paul neighborhood where they were parked.

Serve and protect: To Washington's surprise, police who responded to complaints about the family wanted to help Washington, not hassle her

Officers Mary Alberg and Theresa Spencer wanted to find a better, more permanent solution to Washington's problem.

'They were not going to give up on keeping the family together,' Cmdr. Jill McRae, who ended up buying the family a motel for the night, told the Pioneer Press.

Alberg and Spencer ended up pitching in some more, giving the family several comfortable days in the motel as they searched for more permanent help.

That help soon came thanks to a local TV news story about the family's plight.

A connected viewer reached out to the family with help getting into an area shelter that's usually full.

Washington is in search of work and says she has experience as a women's advocate in a domestic abuse shelter, a medical assistant and other jobs.

Now, as she edges closer to reclaiming her independence, Washington has the police she once feared to thank for the strides she making.

'I wasn't a big fan of the police, but them helping allowed us to view them in a different light and say, 'Yes, they really do want to protect and serve,' she told KMSP. 'It was really nice.'

Washington (here with two of her children) and her family were put up in a motel for several nights when police in the area pooled their funds to help her. Now she's found a longer-term solution in the form of a homeless shelter
