One of the 20 skulls returned home to Namibia after being taken to Germany for experiments over a century ago

Hundreds of jubilant Namibians turned out to welcome home 20 skulls which had been taken to Germany to prove theories of white racial superiority more than a century ago.

The fragile skulls, consisting of four females and 16 males, including a young boy of about three, had been kept at Berlin's Charite University.

Namibian Prime Minister Nahas Angula told the crowd at the country's Windhoek airport that the skulls were a 'testimony to the horrors of colonialism and German cruelty against our people.'

He added: 'The Namibian nation accepts these mortal remains as a symbolic closure of a tragic chapter.

German Ambassador Egon Kochanke said he welcomed home the skulls and added it was time for the two countries to move forward.

The
skulls arrived in Berlin sometime between 1909 and 1914 having been 
removed from their bodies and preserved in formaldehyde intact with 
faces, skin and hair.

They 
were used by scientists as they tried to prove the 'racial superiority' 
of white Europeans over black Africans by analysing the facial features 
of the heads.

Sometime during the 1920s, the heads were further dissected until only the skulls remained.

Researchers say the skulls do not show any sign of violence, and it is not clear how the people died, though they were possibly victims of German forces in Namibia at the time, or died in a German-run concentration camp.

Some members of the country's Herero and Nama tribes waved banners demanding reparations from Germany for what some historians call the first genocide of the 20th century.

Historians say German troops killed and starved to death 60,000 of the 85,000 Herero people from 1904-07.

Herero warriors in military uniform chanted 'We are ready for battle! We are going to fight!' as a leader, chest covered in animal skins, led a cleansing ceremony watched by tribal chiefs in red and yellow hats.

Hundreds of people in ceremonial dress were at the airport - Nama women in white dresses with gathered skirts, Herero women in scarlet and emerald green Victorian robes topped by head-dresses shaped like the horns of cows that are the traditional source of wealth. They sang hymns and traditional praise songs.

Two of the 20 fragile skulls are to be unveiled later at another ceremony at Parliament Gardens in downtown Windhoek.

It is not known how many hundreds more skulls may remain in Germany.

Years of acrimonious negotiations led to the return. Nama chief David Fredericks said his people still want all the skulls sent to Germany returned, and they demand to know the names of the people whose skulls have come home.

'I am happy that the skulls have been 
returned, but we know some have been deliberately made to disappear ... 
the skulls of chiefs,' he said.

Germany
only apologised for the massacres in 2004, during ceremonies marking 
the centenary of the start of the Herero uprising against German 
colonisers.

The skulls had been kept at Berlin's Charite University where they were used to test racial theories

But the German government does not acknowledge that there was a genocide of the Herero in what it then called German South West Africa.

Germany also has refused Herero demands for reparations, saying it gives generous aid to Namibia's government for all the country's two million people.
