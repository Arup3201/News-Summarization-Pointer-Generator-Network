Her family reported her missing to police on Sunday. Ms Morris lives with her mother.

Dowagiac Public Safety Director Steven Grinnewald told MailOnline today that the missing woman is not believed to be in a relationship nor have any mental health problems.

Police have no reason to believe that the woman is in danger, he said.

Limited searches have been taking place, made difficult by the fact that Ms Morris does not have a cell phone or credit card that could be traced.

Deputy Grinnewald said today that the police do not have any reason to believe the young woman is in danger. Ms Morris does have a criminal record but the officerÂ would not provide further details.

The people she was with on July 24 have been interviewed.

A missing poster describes Ms Morris as 5'2 with brown hair and brown eyes. Dowagiac Police Department have issued a phone number for tips - 269 782 9743.

Her family have created a Facebook page to share information about the missing woman.
