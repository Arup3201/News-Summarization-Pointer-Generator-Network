Roy Hodgson last night admitted he underestimated the demands of a World Cup and claimed it could take up to six years to get the best out of this group of players.

Hodgson, who is preparing his team for the final, meaningless group game with Costa Rica on Tuesday, said: ‘I’ve realised that, at this top level in a World Cup, it is unbelievably unforgiving.

‘A moment of misfortune can throw everyone into a realm of despair that you didn’t know was possible. I’ve learned how painful it is to build up your hopes and to see a lot of good preparations be of no avail because it didn’t get us to where we wanted.

Failure: England were eliminated from the World Cup after losing their two opening games to Italy and Uruguay

‘This game will tell me a lot about the players. It’s been a very tough few days and it’s hard to pick yourselves up for a game that, even if you do well in, serves no purpose.

‘The 100-cap players will find that hard. We’ll learn a lot about the others. I’ve liked what I’ve seen around the hotel and in training. I’m now giving them the opportunity, not because I can, but because this is a good team and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right.

‘We just hope the next two, four to six years will bring some dividends. We are no longer capable of going through, but we’re trying to build the confidence and use the potential of some quite talented players who have emerged on the scene.

‘All we can do is hope that, when these players are reaching their best years at the age of 28 or 29, the work shows some dividends.’

England face Costa Rica at the scene of the 1950 World Cup defeat against the USA and Hodgson has made a raft of changes to the team that was beaten 2-1 by both Italy and Uruguay. He named it yesterday before the team started their final training session inside the stadium.

Next generation: Players like Raheem Sterling represent England's future

Frank Lampard will captain the side and will move level with Sir Bobby Charlton on 106 caps when he leads England out here. Lampard spoke passionately about the future of the national team before the Italy clash last week and told the players to prove they are men when they face Costa Rica in the Mineirao Stadium this afternoon.

Lampard, who will make a decision on his international future over the summer, said: ‘We have to show we are men. It’s a good test of character and it’s been a tough few days. We came here to do better than what’s turned out.

‘Wayne, Steven, and Joe have all said we’re disappointed, but as grown men we have to move on. This is about showing the pride of wearing an England shirt, whether it’s a friendly or a game like this.

‘It would be easy to roll over and say it hasn’t been our tournament, and go home with three defeats. If we can take anything from this tournament it’s been the progression behind the scenes and, hopefully, a win.’

Man up! Frank Lampard has sent a rally call to England's players to not leave the tournament without a win

Lampard insisted that the management and coaching staff did everything within their power to make sure the team was successful in Brazil.

He added: ‘There’s great ability, the most successful league in the world. The young players who have come into this squad were the ones we were  crying out for in the aftermath of the South Africa World Cup.

‘We have to make the most out of our attributes, all the English attributes, and if we can bring it to the table then it might be the magic dust. We have to try to learn. Talent will win you competitions. We’ve prepared very well for this tournament — they’ve not missed a trick, so there are no excuses for us players.

‘But it’s about performing on the pitch. We can hope that talent blossoms and there’s more beneath.’

Lampard also responded to Harry Redknapp’s claim that a number of Tottenham players had begged him to find an excuse to withdraw them from international duty during his spell at White Hart Lane.

Next big thing: Ross Barkley will be handed a start for England's final World Cup game

Got the nod: Jack Wilshere and Luke Shaw (L) will also be given an opportunity to show what they can do

The former Chelsea midfielder said: ‘I don’t know of any present players, but if there are individuals like that then I’m sure their England careers are nothing to write home about. It should be the pinnacle. If you want to be at home or on holiday with your mates then it wouldn’t be the right attitude.’

Hodgson has changed his entire defence for tonight’s game, giving a competitive debut to Luke Shaw, and has also brought in Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere to start alongside  Lampard in midfield.

Although Liverpool forward Rickie Lambert is completely fit, he has been overlooked in favour of a third successive start for Daniel Sturridge.

Surprise package: Bryan Ruiz's Costa Rica have gone from underdogs to possible group winners

Hodgson added: ‘We have a different team and I want everyone to go home having taken part and played in this game. We are conscious of the fact that the fans are devastated. We came into the hotel and received a lot of sympathy.

‘We want to take some encouragement from that and recognise that this is a top-class international on the biggest stage.

‘Costa Rica have taken he football world by surprise and this is a chance to show that we can compete, a chance to show we have a lot of pride in our performance.

‘This is a great opportunity for the team to go out there on this fantastic stage and show that they have a lot of potential and are already good enough to wear the England shirt.

‘And I believe they will not let us down.’
