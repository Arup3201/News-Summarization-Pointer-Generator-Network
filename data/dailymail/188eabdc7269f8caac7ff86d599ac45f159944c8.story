The eldest son of missing Utah mother Susan Powell told his teacher 'my mom is dead' after her disappearance and also told police she went on the camping trip with them but 'did not come back'.

This is just some of the shocking evidence released in sealed court documents about the initial investigation into the mother's disappearance, who went missing in December 6, 2009. Her body has never been found.

The documents also revealed that authorities immediately classified the case as a murder and kidnapping probe, according to the heavily redacted court documents released on Tuesday.

Despite what seems like overwhelming evidence against her husband Josh Powell, he was never arrested or even labeled a suspect, leaving him free to kill himself and his young sons at their home in Washington state earlier this year.

Loss: A report has found that social workers failed to consult law enforcement before allowing Josh Powell to see his sons, who he killed in a house explosion. Their mother Susan was missing

Missing: Susan Powell vanished from the couple's Utah home in 2009. She had said she feared her husband

The documents reveal that a search of the Powell home turned up blood evidence not only on the sofa, but on nearby carpet and a tile floor.  Forensic tests showed it belonged to Susan.

They also found Susan's purse with all her cards, money and identification. When they told Josh about this, he did not seem concerned and did not ask if they had found her throughout the whole investigation, according to documents.

What police did not tell Josh, the documents reveal, is there was also a safe deposit key in her purse.

When they traced it to a local Wells Fargo, they found that only Susan had access to it and she had used it only twice.

Inside the box was a folded letter addressed to her friends and family with specific instructions that it should not be shown to her husband, writing that she didn't trust him.

The letter - signed by Susan and dated June 28, 2008 - stated that Josh Powell threatened to destroy her if she ever divorced him and 'leave the children without a mother and father'.

She also wrote that if she died, 'it may not be an accident even if it looks like one'.

The affidavit, which is just a part of a large number of sealed documents in the missing mother's case, also reveal that when police searched Josh Powell's van after he returned from the late-night camping trip with his sons, they found a generator, blankets, a gas can, tarps, circular saw, humidifier, utility knife, latex gloves, rake, sleds, and a shovel.

They also found Susan's cellphone with no SIM card in it.

When questioned about his impromptu 
late-night camping trip, Powell told authorities he was testing out a 
new generator, according to the documents.

As well as eldest son Charlie telling investigators his mother had gone camping with them but 'decided to stay and not come home', Susan's other son Braden, who was just two at the time, said his mother was 'in the trunk'.

On January 3, 2010, Charlie Powell was attending church in Puyallup, Washington, when the teacher said she was going to have to get his mom or dad because he was misbehaving.

He answered with 'no emotion and without hesitation' that 'my mom is dead', according to documents which were released by the Salt Lake Tribune.

After interviewing many of Susan's friends as part of the investigation, authorities were told about bizarre comments
Josh Powell made at his wife’s Christmas work party regarding 'how to kill 
someone, dispose of the body and not get caught'. 

Information was also received during 
this investigation that Josh Powell was the beneficiary of several life 
insurance policies totaling $1.5million on Susan Powell.

Probe: Powell had always mainatined his innocence and said she had gone missing when he was camping

He also said he liked 
to go camping in Utah's west desert because it was filled with mine 
shafts and tunnels and was the perfect place to 'dispose of someone and
no one would ever search for the body', one of the recently released documents 
states.

After detectives seized the family 
van, Josh went that evening to the Salt Lake City International Airport 
to rent a car. He kept the car for two days and drove it 800 miles.

He subsequently refused to speak with 
police or to take a lie detector test. Within ten days of his wife’s 
disappearance, Josh Powell had cancelled Susan Powell’s upcoming 
chiropractic appointments, told their day care provider the children 
would not be returning and withdrawn all the money in his wife’s IRA 
accounts.

On December 6, the day Susan 
disappeared, her friend Jovanna Owings told police she was at the Powell
home and Susan 'became very tired after eating a meal Josh had prepared
for her'. That was the last time she would see her.

Utah authorities maintain the 
investigation remains active and open, but said the documents reveal 
their painstaking efforts to close the case and find Susan.

Jailed: Disturbing journal entries of Steve Powell, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison, have been released

Stalker: Multiple photographs of Susan that 
appeared to be secretly taken were stuck to the book, like this one of 
her 'applying makeup'

Sick: The Pierce County Sheriff's Office 
released about 3,000 pages of evidence in the case against Steven 
Powell, including entries from his journals that detail his 
uncontrollable love for his daughter-in-law Susan Cox Powell

The records help 'make the public aware, to some extent, of what's been 
going on', West Valley City police Sgt Mike Powell said on Tuesday.

'We've
been working diligently and very hard on this investigation.'

Publicly, they would only say the case
remained active while sharing little else, and they never specifically 
labeled Josh Powell a suspect.

Anne Bremner, an attorney for Susan 
Powell's parents, said that's not good enough. She has been fighting for
the release of the entire case file under a Utah law that provides 
victims the same rights and access to investigative records as criminal 
defendants.

'We'll keep making attempts to get the
full measure of the records,' Bremner said on Tuesday. 'Until I'm 
satisfied that I have everything, my clients have instructed me to keep 
going forward.'

Other documents released this week chronicle Steven Powell's uncontrollable love and spiraling obsession with Susan.

In passages from 17 spiral notebooks written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about and urges towards Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes they would be together.

He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem of her being married to my son.

'The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.'

He also wrote: 'My biggest problem as well as my greatest pleasure lies in the fact that for over a year I have been madly in love with my daughter-in-law, Susan.

'I have never lusted for a woman as I do for Susan.'

He admitted in the passages that he secretly recorded his daughter-in-law from as early as January 2003 and would watch videos of her while masturbating.

He admitted 'looking at her naked body under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 'sick' thing to do.

His obsession with her, he said, 'represents the first time I’ve mentioned fetishes and what might be considered sociopathic. I mean, who looks under the bathroom door with a mirror?'

The journal included countless photos of Susan and different parts of her body. He also revealed he stole some of her belongings including her underwear, her hair and even discarded wax strips.

He was jailed in June for 30 months on charges of voyeurism against his neighbor's children.
