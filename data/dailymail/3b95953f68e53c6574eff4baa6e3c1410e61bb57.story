Fragments of DNA from two unidentified people were found on the bag holding the body of MI6 spy Gareth Williams.

The traces were discovered during a 
search in which ‘almost everything conceivable’ was done to find out if 
anyone else had been in the flat where his body was found.

But a forensic expert admitted neither is likely to lead to a suspect because they contain partial and common fragments of DNA.

Mystery: The body of spy Gareth Williams was found in a bag in his bathroom in Pimlico in August 2010

Scotland Yard detectives are now pinning their hopes on tests on a green hand towel recovered from the secret agent’s kitchen.

Ros Hammond, of LGC Forensics, said: 
‘There is hope. Tests are still in progress and there may be some 
promising results . . . within a matter of weeks.’

Her findings will be 
seized upon by detectives desperate to identify a third party who they 
believe padlocked Mr Williams, 31, in the holdall.

The naked and decomposing body of the 
code-breaker was found a week later in the bath of his flat in Pimlico, 
London, on August 23, 2010.

The latest evidence came as the inquest into his mysterious death entered its final stages at Westminster Coroner’s Court.

Experts said that despite being young 
and fit, Mr Williams would have succumbed to the ‘soporific’ effect of 
carbon dioxide poisoning ‘within two to three minutes’ of being zipped 
inside the North Face holdall.

Three pathologists agreed he either 
suffocated or was killed by a mystery poison that cannot be detected 
because it disappeared during decomposition.

Summing up the forensic evidence found
in Mr Williams’s home, Mrs Hammond said the first trace of unidentified
DNA, from the handle of the bag, may belong to a police forensic 
scientist who also left a trace on the dead man’s hand.

The second, recovered from the 
padlock, is likely to be old and contained a fragment of DNA found in 
half the British population.

Mrs Hammond said there was no evidence
that DNA had been cleaned from the flat, but admitted a third party 
could have avoided leaving traces by wearing protective clothing and 
gloves.

Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked 
inside a holdall in the bath of his flat

Pathologist Dr Ian Calder said Mr Williams probably died from hypocapnia, a fatal accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood.

He said the spy may have had no time 
to realise he was in danger before being overwhelmed by the gas as it 
built up in the bag with every breath.

Another pathologist, Dr Richard 
Shepherd, said the spy must have got into the bag himself as it would be
‘extremely difficult’ to place a ‘floppy’ dead body in such a neat 
position.

He said there was no evidence Mr Williams was manhandled but conceded he could have been sedated or forced inside at gunpoint.

The second week of the inquest into 
Mr Williams’ baffling death heard evidence from three pathologists who 
examined his body in minute detail.

The hearing was also told that DNA was 'at least' two other people was found in the flat where the MI6 officer was found dead.

They
found few clues as to what happened in the final moments of his life 
which led to his body being found in a padlocked North Face holdall in 
his bath.

But they agreed 
that the high-flying code-breaker either died from some form of 
suffocation or was killed with an undetected poison.

Coroner
Dr Fiona Wilcox was told that decomposition, accelerated by his 
position in the bag during a hot summer month in his heated flat, 
hindered their investigations.

The dead man’s MI6 boss has been criticised for failing to act decisively until seven days after he failed to turn up for work.

Dr
Calder said carbon dioxide can cause ‘havoc with the chemistry of the 
body’ as it leaves the victim confused and unable to act.

The
results, known as hypocapnia, would include headaches, then confusion 
and eventually unconsciousness and cardiac arrest, the inquest heard.

Dr Shepherd said the spy got into the 
bag himself as it would be ‘extremely difficult’ to place a ‘floppy’ 
dead body in such a neat position.

He said there is no evidence Mr Williams was manhandled but conceded he could have been sedated or forced inside at gunpoint.

He said: ‘I think it would have been a very difficult process to achieve, getting a body so neatly into a bag. Were he to be alive and struggling I would anticipate there to have been injuries.’

Speaking about carbon dioxide poisoning, he added: ‘There may have been a period of awareness but it may have been short and rapidly contradicted by his decreasing ability to escape.’

Asked about how he may have died in the bag, Dr Shepherd said a struggle for fresh air would have been a ‘strong driver’ for an attempt to escape.

But he added: ‘There would have been a time when he was aware, it is possible. But carbon dioxide poisoning can cause confusion very quickly.’

Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of 
his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth
Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence

Forensic scientist Ros Hammond said there was DNA detected on the bag and handles which did not come from Mr Williams but there was 'no complete indication from one individual.'

She said it involved 'complex mixtures' and that it was 'not always possible to unravel the mixture and identify the individual', meaning they are 'unconfirmed components.'

She also said DNA found on the bag could have been deposited years ago and said there were no samples consistent with his work colleagues - samples were obtained from 15 anonymous colleagues - being in the flat.

The inquest heard Mr Wiliams had several small grazes on his arms which could be consistent with an attempt to open the bag, but not a panicked escape attempt.

Mystery: The spy's body was found inside the bag, padlocked from the outside

Unsolved: The inquest has heard that 
whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one 
and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry'

Dr Benjamin Swift said the cause of Mr Williams’ death was ‘unascertained’ but that poisoning or asphyxiation were ‘probably rather than possibly’ to blame.

He said the badly-decomposed condition of the body indicated the spy probably died shortly after he was last seen alive on August 15.

The inquest had heard how it would have been almost impossible for Mr Williams to lock himself inside the bag with a small brass travel padlock.

Two experts tried more than 400 times to seal themselves inside an identical bag but were unable to do so, saying escapologist ‘Houdini would struggle’.

The detective responsible for the investigation has said she is convinced a third party must have been involved in his death or a cover up.

Fragments of unidentifiable DNA were found on the zip but there are no other traces of anybody else in his flat.

The inquest is expected to conclude tomorrow.
