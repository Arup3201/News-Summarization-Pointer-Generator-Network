A Welsh policeman has become an internet star after he was filmed performing a Maori-style Haka in the middle of a street before a rugby match.

PC Rob Green spends most of his days responding to serious crashes on Wales' roads, but found himself bringing Cardiff city centre to a standstill as he joined rugby fans for the tribal war cry.

PC Green, wearing full armour and his police helmet, needed little coercion to join in with Welsh fans before the clash with New Zealand last Saturday.

The enthusiastic officer had onlookers in stitches as he performed the Haka, which was caught on camera.

More than 120,000 people have watched the policeman's imitation of the All Blacks' pre-match ritual and the video has been shared on Twitter and Facebook more than 22,000 times.

PC Green said: 'I joined in with the Haka because I think it's nice to show the human side of the police.

'The safety of the public is paramount at all times of course but it was nice to have the opportunity to enjoy with the fans, especially those from overseas.

'I just hope that the New Zealand fans in particular will see that South Wales Police officers are positive and professional but there's a human side to all of us too.'

PC Green, who gave up rugby as a schoolboy 'due to a massive lack of talent', said he knew the moves from watching All Blacks' matches on television.

'[New Zealand are] the best team in the world so I've watched them do the Haka on the TV so many times. I like to think they'll be pretty impressed with my moves. I did go a bit wrong at one point but I'm sure they won't mind.

'To be honest I'm waiting for Strictly [Come Dancing] to come knocking on my door now.'

The officer, a member of South Wales Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, in  Swansea, was drafted in to help police Cardiff city centre after more than 70,000 rugby fans descended on the Welsh capital for the Autumn International match.  

'When we're drafted in for football or rugby matches it's our opportunity to get out and meet the public, which is something I really enjoy and something that's important to me.

'I joined the force 19-and-a-half years ago to protect the public and being with them out on the streets is part of this role.

'There's nothing quite like 70,000-plus fans all there to watch a game of rugby between two of the best teams in the world - everyone is there for a good time and to enjoy themselves and it's great to be a part of that.'

By the time PC Green finished his shift, his colleagues had already pinned a note to the door of his office reading 'PC Sonny Green's Office' - a reference to New Zealand player Sonny Williams.

Friends of the officer in Australia and New Zealand also got in touch after seeing the video online.   

The video was posted on the South Wales Police Facebook page, where dozens of people have commended the policeman for his actions. 

Ron Collins said: 'Well done Rob Green. You are a credit to your uniform.'

Another user Howard Wilkins added: 'We need more coppers like him - well done PC Rob Green!'
