Languidly leaning against a window sporting a sharply tailored blazer, cream shirt and slouchy peg leg, Miranda Kerr looks every inch the model businesswoman in the new AW campaign for Mango.

In another, the Australian model, who has been the face of the Spanish brand for just over a year, is seen wrapping up warmly in a Scandinavian-style fair isle knit, edgily ripped boyfriend jeans and a cosy sheepskin coat.

A third shows the 30-year-old pouting and leaning back against a wall in a party-perfect black mini-dress complete with an edgy leather hem.

Miranda Kerr is the star of Mango's AW campaign

The Australian model replaced Kate Moss as the face of the brand late in 2012

The new campaign was shot on location in New York by veteran photographic duo, Inez & Vinoodh and was styled by Geralding Saglio.

'I had a great time shooting the Autumn Winter campaign for Mango with Inez and Vinoodh,' the Australian model told Grazia.

'They are an amazing team to work with - we have such a good time together.'

Stylis Geralding Saglio pulled the mannish looks together from the retailer's AW collection

She added: 'The clothing is especially fun this season with a punk-inspired edge. I loved that Inez and Vinoodh kept the look of the campaign very raw and natural and I think it compliments the collection very well. They did a fantastic job, as always!'

Fans used to seeing Miranda wearing a lot less needn't panic though,

This week the Instagram addict has been sharing behind the scenes pictures from her latest bikini shoot.

Miranda said of the shoot crew team: 'They are an amazing team to work with - we have such a good time together.'

The 30-year-old complimented the photographers: 'The clothing is especially fun this season with a punk-inspired edge. I loved that Inez and Vinoodh kept the look of the campaign very raw and natural.'

And alongside the the swimsuit-clad 
photograph she revealed more than just her fantastic figure, as
 she shared what makes her happy.

The
 mother-of-one posted an image of herself at the beach on Sunday in which she forms a heart with her hands while wearing 
an animal print string two-piece.

'To love and be loved is one of the greatest gifts in the world,' she wrote as a caption to go alongside the photo.

The brunette mother shared another swimsuit shot shortly after in which she 
can be seen in a black bikini top and a long black skirt.
