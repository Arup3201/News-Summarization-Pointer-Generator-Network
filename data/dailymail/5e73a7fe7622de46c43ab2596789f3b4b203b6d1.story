Green initiatives: Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced agreements to buy energy from 27 new renewable energy projects until 2040

More than £4billion in lucrative energy contracts was yesterday handed out to wind and solar schemes – but green lobbyists immediately insisted it was not enough.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced agreements to buy energy from 27 new renewable energy projects until 2040.

The subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms, five solar arrays, two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants. 

Mr Davey said the schemes will eventually power 1.4million homes. But parts of the green energy industry said they had not been treated fairly in the bidding process. 

The ‘Contracts for Difference’ scheme, which will guarantee energy firms a fixed price for their power for 15 years, will be funded by ordinary householders through their electricity bills.

The scheme adds a subsidy on to the basic wholesale cost of electricity as part of the Government’s drive to expand renewable energy projects.

The subsidies will cost up to £315million a year - an estimated total of at least £4billion over the lifetime of the scheme once fluctuations in the energy market are taken into account.

Solar industry leaders complained that wind had been favoured by the Government, despite solar being cheaper.

Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said: ‘The soon to be cheapest and most popular renewable - solar power - has lost out in a complex auction scheme that favours big players and genuinely established technologies.

‘Is a policy that trips up the UK’s emerging solar industry really a successful policy? We don’t think so.’

Alex Fornal, head of project development at Solar company Juwi, which made three unsuccessful bids, said wind had taken most of what was already a ‘minuscule’ budget.

‘If properly supported solar will become the first renewable to compete with conventional generation by the end of the decade,’ he said.

Simon Bullock of Friends of the Earth added: ‘Ministers should be investing far more on the UK’s huge renewable energy potential.’

Critics of renewable energy subsidies said green power firms needed to ‘grow up’.

John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘This industry is behaving like a spoiled brat - you can never give it enough subsidies, it will always want more.

‘They have to grow up and come into the real world and compete.’

Mr Davey insisted the ‘reverse auction’ process - in which lower bids were favoured for the contracts - would save bill-payers a total of £110million a year.

‘This world-leading auction has delivered contracts for renewables projects right across the UK,’ he said.

‘These projects could power 1.4 million homes, create thousands of green jobs and give a massive boost to home-grown energy while reducing our reliance on volatile foreign markets.

‘The auction has driven down prices and secured the best possible deal for this new clean, green energy.’

The Government’s independent Committee on Climate Change estimates that green subsidies and taxes currently add £45 to dual gas and electricity bills – a figure that will rise to £100 by 2020 and £175 by 2030.
