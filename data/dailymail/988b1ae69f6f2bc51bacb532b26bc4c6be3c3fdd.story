A father sent a chilling text to his wife that he had killed their four children before then trying to take his own life.

Prosecutors in the northern state of Lower Saxony, Germany, said police found the bodies of the four youngsters, aged five, seven, nine and 12, in the town of Gross Ilsede on Thursday evening.

Their 36-year-old father had suffered serious injuries, "presumably" from trying to commit suicide, and was now in an induced coma in hospital.

According to the prosecutor in nearby Hildesheim, the man had left a suicide note detailing "marital problems" and said that his wife was abroad on holiday at the time.

It is believed that the man told her about the deaths of their daughter and three sons by text message. She then passed the message on to relatives, who contacted the police.

When officers arrived at the family's semi-detached home, they found the children's bodies and their seriously injured father, along with the suicide note.

According to German newspaper, The Local, prosecutors said the children had suffered "cut injuries" and were thought to be asleep at the time of the attack.

Crime scene: an investigation is now underway into the deaths of the four children

A murder inquiry has been opened and police continue to hunt for the weapon used in the killings.

The father will be arrested on suspicion of murder when he awakes. 

Despite the note indicating there were marriage problems, there is no indication that the couple were separated.

The prosecutor’s office added that the man was not previously known to police and described the family as "completely ordinary."

According to reports, the mother has now returned to Germany. Autopsies are expected to be performed today.
