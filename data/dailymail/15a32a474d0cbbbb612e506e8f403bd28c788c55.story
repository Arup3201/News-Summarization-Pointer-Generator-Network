When you're thinking about a hair update, it's sometimes hard to know where to start; what or who to trust.

You might flick through a hair magazine and find a style you like - only, you know it's taken hours to create on a professional model, and it's been photoshopped to death.

Or, you might find a picture of a celebrity hair style you want to copy - but good luck finding out who the stylist is or what exactly they've had done to their hair.

Web tool called HAIRCVT.com is here and set to revolutionise the way we 'shop' for a new hairstyle

While of course they do a better job than we ever could, hairdressers can only guess at how to recreate an image presented to them. 

Now, a new web tool called HAIRCVT.com is here and set to revolutionise the way we 'shop' for a new hairstyle; by showing us real results on real people from real appointments - and then letting us book with their stylist.

This way, depending on what the appointment was for, the hairdresser will know exactly how that hair you loved was created.

Whether you want the same cut, dye or style - as long as they did it, and your hair is not too dissimilar to the original client's, they can recreate the look.

As long as your hair is suitable and similar - you could have the exact same thing done as you see on screen

HAIRCVT.com has everything from cutting edge fades done in Dalston to bouncy blowdries in Chelsea and retro updos in Holloway.

It lets users browse thousands of real hairstyles and filter them by sex, hair colour, hair type or price band.

Each hairstyle is smartly categorised so you can refine their search using associated word tags;  type of hairstyle, technique, location, or salon.

Once you find the style for you, you can get told the name of the stylist and then  click through to see their portfolio of appointment results and price list for various services.

Then you're given all the information you need to call and book.

Easton Regal on Clerkenwell Road in London were one of the first salons to sign up to the service when they started up in summer.

Co-owner Bryn Wilkins says: 'I love precision cutting, that's my signature style and with HAIRCVT I can really show it off with no gimmicks.

'I love the tool. When we build our hair galleries, consumers can see, for real, the haircuts and colours that we are so good at and that we enjoy doing.

With HAIRCVT you can even see the back of a style - something you can never do with magazines

'Our galleries are a true reflection of the hairdresser's specialities and skill. Some hairdresser like to cut, some love to colour and some are great at hair-up.

'Being able to show your client the back of a haircut is something you can never do when looking at hairstyles in magazines - but with HAIRCVT you can.

'Our portfolios are also handy when clients are finding it hard to describe what they want from their hair. The web tool serves another purpose as a visual aid in day-to-day consultations. The haircuts are not only the hairdresser's work; they are on real people and not models.'

Makers say all of the hairstyles are selected from the best salons in London and suitable for all price ranges. 

From top names like John Frieda, Gina Conway and Easton Regal to the best up-and coming salons like Blue Tit, Stunt Dolly and Luke Jacob further East; from the premium to the budget, what you see is what you get.

With more than 1,500 hairstyles loaded up from London-based salons so far, HAIRCVT hope to branch out nationwide and into Europe.
