A collaborative campaign between  and a popular ice-cream brand and an equality organisation is set to turn up the heat on the federal government to legalise same sex marriage.

Dubbed #EqualityCalling, the initiative is a mass voice-mail campaign which urges the public to record messages supporting gay marriage that will be automatically delivered to their federal representatives.

Ben and Jerry's and Australian Marriage Equality will debut a custom phone box at the popular Mardi Gras' fair, with the crowd being urged to leave a voicemail on it for their local MP.

The #EqualityCalling phone box, which will feature in the Fair Day on 22 February, is an iconic London phone box given a Mardi Gras rainbow coloured makeover that will serve as a powerful symbol of solidarity.

Those unable to attend can leave their messages of support on the #EqualityCalling hotline, which is: 1300 663 679.

Kalli Swaik, a spokesperson for Ben & Jerry's Australia, said the company is an adamant supporter of the cause.

'We're immensely proud to support an issue that embodies so many of our core values, ' she said.

'We believe that everyone in a loving relationship should be able to celebrate their commitment to each other in marriage, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.'

Ben and Jerry's is also renaming its iconic ice cream flavour Chocolate Chip CookieDough to 'I DOugh, I DOugh' so fans can also show their support across the country.

Australian Marriage Equality, a national organisation launched in 2004, believe the campaign offers an pivotal link between the government and the public.

 'It will give marriage equality supporters a quick and easy way to reach all their federal representatives and it gives us a way to publicly highlight the substantial number of contacts politicians are receiving from constituents,' said Rodney Croome, the company director.

Polls show that 72 per cent of Australians support marriage equality in Australia, suggesting the campaign could be met with substantial support.
