A California driver was killed at the wheel after a metal pipe smashed through his windscreen and impaled him to his seat on Wednesday morning.

The 33-year-old man was found dead in the driver's seat, with the car's engine still running, by a highway patrols officer. No one else was in the car.

After the pipe smashed the window of the Volvo XC70 the car veered into the center divider and came to rest on the embankment, near Livermore just after 8am.

No witnesses spotted where the 2ft pipe came from, but it was described as being similar to those used to secure loads on to large trucks. 

'No witnesses saw it bouncing down the road, nobody's called in to say that they lost anything of this sort,' patrol officer Tyler Hahn said.

An officer for California Highways Patrol said it was unlikely that the owner of the pipe will be traced because the pole had no markings. 

Sgt Rick Luciano, of the highways patrol
department told ABC7: 'It somehow came loose, flew through the air and went 
through the windshield.'

The pipe impaled the driver, who died at the scene of the crash on the busy commuter route.

The victim has not yet been name, but it is believed that he is from Rocklin near Sacramento. 

Mr Hahn described the crash as 'a freak accident' and said was 'literally is being in the wrong place at the wrong time'.
