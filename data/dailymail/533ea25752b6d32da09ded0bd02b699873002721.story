Meet the adorable twin sisters who are stealing tourists' hearts at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

At barely a month old, the pair of cheetah cubs are being hand-raised by staff and receiving around-the-clock care with regular bottle feedings.

Thousands of people have fallen in love with the tiny cubs after the zoo released an 80-second video that shows them wrestling in their enclosure, excitedly drinking milk from a bottle and struggling to walk at such a young age.

Pile on: The cheetah cubs were born at San Diego Zoo Safari Park in early September

Weighing just three pounds each, the curious cheetahs playfully bite each other and make tiny squeaking noises as visitors look on. 

Because their mother, Allie, has been unsuccessful in raising her previous litters, staff decided to hand rear them at the park’s cheetah breeding facility.

While they’re adorable now, the cubs will eventually move on to a carnivore diet and grow into big cats with a weight of up to 140 pounds and incredible speed.

The cheetah is the fastest land mammal on the planet with a speed of around 60 mph.

Zoo staff say the cubs are becoming increasingly active now that their eyes are open and their vision is becoming clearer, and they are full of personality.

Eileen Neff, lead keeper at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, said: ‘Every baby's different, but these cheetahs really seem to be developing quickly in our eyes.

‘They are great eaters, they started playing when they were just three or four days old. They could barely walk at that time, so it was pretty interesting seeing them tumbling around with each other.’ 

Fast friends: The cubs will eventually be paired with a domestic dog for companionship

But the cute factor doesn’t end here.

Without their mother to learn from, the cubs will eventually be paired with a domestic dog for companionship.

The dog's body language instructs the cheetah that there's nothing to fear in new or public surroundings, which relaxes and calms the young animal.
