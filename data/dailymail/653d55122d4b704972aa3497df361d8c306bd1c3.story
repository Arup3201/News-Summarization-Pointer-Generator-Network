A psychology professor accused of masterminding the murder of her alleged rapist in Orange County, California, has spoken out, saying she is the victim of a violent rape and of her abusive ex-boyfriend, who murdered her rapist.

Patricia Esparza, 39, says 18 years ago she was forced to join a group of people, including her then ex-boyfriend Gianni Van, 44, in kidnapping Gonzalo Ramirez, 24, and witnessed them beating him as revenge for allegedly raping Esparza in her dorm room.

Esparza is one of four suspects to face charges for the 1995 killing of Ramirez, whose body was found hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the side of a road in Orange County. A fifth suspect died in July.

The married mother and professor at Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland, was offered a deal: plead guilty and face just three years behind bars. She refused the deal, saying she won't admit to something she didn't do.

If convicted for the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez, she could face a life sentence. Esparza spoke to NBC's Today from her prison cell yesterday.

She told Today that her then ex-boyfriend Gianni Van kidnapped Ramirez and forced her to be a party to a violent beating, then two weeks later made her marry him, knowing that as his spouse she could not be compelled to testify against him.

Esparza told the Pasadena Star News that she and Van had never lived together.

Speaking out: Esparza spoke to NBC's Today show about the case, saying she was forced into witnessing violence against Ramirez by Van but didn't know he had been murdered

'Never, ever did I give any indication that I wanted Gonzalo Ramirez to be harmed,' she told Dateline.

'What I can tell you is that I was dragged, pressured, bullied, intimidated into that night when they actually took Gonzalo Ramirez,' she said.

'I never saw him dead. I didn't know that he had been dead. But I was terrorized by the violence that I witnessed.'

Esparza says she was not aware Ramirez had been murdered until weeks later when she was questioned by police.

Esparza, a professor at Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland, was arrested in the cold case murder late last year after re-entering the U.S. for an academic conference.

The four other suspects in the case have all pleaded not guilty.

'It just hurts me so much that I had 
been raped, and here he [Van] is, instead of consoling me, he destroyed 
the rest of my life,' she said.

'You know, the abuse was difficult, the rape was difficult, but dragging me through that night, it haunts me.'

Prosecutors say Esparza is playing the 'victim card' and is using her psychology knowledge to sway public opinion to her side.

'She’s a very sophisticated defendant,' prosecutor Susan Kang Schroeder told Pasadena Star News.

'She
 has a Ph.D in psychology and she knows how to play on people’s 
emotions, including the use of her 4-year-old daughter as a prop at the 
press conference. This is a woman who is trying to act like the victim 
in this case when the real victim was brutally murdered and the case 
went unsolved for 20 years.'

Esparza refused the plea deal on November 20, saying, 'The principle of what they're asking me is to plead guilty to something that they know I am not responsible for,' she said.

She
 will now face trial for one felony count of special circumstance murder
 - a charge that can carry a life sentence without parole.

Prosecutors are calling the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez a 'revenge killing.'

They allege that on 15 April, 1995, a 20-year-old Esparza was at a bar with a group of friends 
including former boyfriend Gianni Van, when she pointed out Ramirez, 
claiming he had raped her in her dorm room at Pomona College a few 
months earlier.

According to the prosecution, Esparza, 
Van, Kody Tran, Diane Tran and Shannon 'Jailbird' Gries followed Ramirez
 when he left the bar in the early hours of the following morning.

They intentionally rear-ended his vehicle, say prosecutors, forcing him to get out of the car to inspect the damage.

He was then kidnapped. His body was found on the side of Sand Canyon Road in Santa Ana hours later.

Esparza
 says she was forced by the aggressive Van to identify Ramirez and then 
coerced to keep the secret of his murder for almost two decades.

Diane Tran, Shannon Gries and Gianni Van have also been charged. All have pleaded not guilty.

Kody Tran died after shooting himself in a  standoff with police last year.

According to the Los Angeles Times,
 Esparza says she met Ramirez in a Santa Ana nightclub. The next morning
 he asked her to breakfast and offered to drive her and some friends 
back to Pomona College.

Once in her dorm room, he raped Esparza, who went to a school nurse and was given the morning-after pill.

She was too ashamed to report the rape to authorities and the nurse did not advise her to do so.

'I don't think I was thinking at that
 time,' she said. 'I felt ashamed. I felt guilty. I didn't want to come 
forward because I didn't want my family to know.'

Julie Ann Rojas, who was Gries then-girlfriend, testified that she was with Van and Esparza the night Ramirez died.

She
 said Van, Gries and Kody Tran attacked Ramirez while she and Esparza 
went to a bar. After about an hour Roja and Esparza went to the 
transmission shop owned by Kody Tran where Esparza said she saw Ramirez 
tied and hanging from the ceiling.

Esparza's
 current husband Jorge Mancillas, a world-renowned medical researcher, said that his wife was told that Ramirez was 'roughed up' and was unaware of the murder until weeks later when she was questioned by police.

Esparza, who says she suffered years of sexual abuse by her father as a child, told reporters at a news conference Wednesday 20 November that she lived in fear of Van for years after the attack.

'All I knew is that I wanted to survive,' she said.

'All I knew was that these people were dangerous and I just needed to stay quiet and withdraw and come out of that night alive.'

Senior deputy district attorney Scott Simmons said there is sufficient evidence 'to prove she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.'

Mancillas and Esparza's four-year-old daughter Arianna were in the courtroom as she was handcuffed.

The family lives in a small town in France on the Swiss border and Esparza is an assistant professor of psychology and counseling at Webster University.

She will return to court on December 23. 

Esparza and Mancillas have set up a petition at change.org to try to persuade Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas to drop the charges against Esparza.

'We are astonished that Norma Patricia, a rape victim, is now being treated as a criminal. We are also concerned about the effect this past year has had on her 4-year-old daughter and the long-term impact this will have if the situation is not resolved in her favor,' the petition reads.

'In continuing to pursue her you are sending a troubling message to other rape victims who already have a sense that they will not receive justice within the legal system.'
