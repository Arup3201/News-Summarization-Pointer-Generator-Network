Just seven weeks ago, Steve Peters seemed to be a cure for all sporting ills. A quiet word from the good doctor in your ear and you’d be strong, focused, a winner – like his clients Steven Gerrard, Luis Suarez or Ronnie O’Sullivan.

How things can change. In this World Cup, Peters’ famed 'inner chimp' has fallen from the highest branches and hit the ground with an almighty crash.

The first alarm bells rang out on April 27 when Gerrard committed Premier League title suicide against Chelsea. The following week, Peters’ greatest supporter O’Sullivan surrendered his world snooker title to Mark Selby.

Disappointment: Peters was mooted as the man who could cure England's World Cup woes

Since then, things have gone from bad to worse for Peters in Brazil.

The England squad he was to work with have looked uncomfortable under pressure – something Peters was meant to put right. In fact, results have got even worse.

And on Tuesday night, his influence hit rock-bottom when star pupil Suarez unlearned everything he was supposed to have taken from regular contact with Peters and bit Giorgio Chiellini in a moment of utter madness.

It was Suarez’s third offence and the Uruguayan’s reputation and career now hangs in the balance, probably to the discomfort of his eminent English sports psychiatrist.

Eye witnesses said Peters – revered in British cycling as the reason they dominated the world at the London Olympics –  did not strike a confident or assertive figure during his time with the England squad as if the whole World Cup circus was a bit of a culture shock.

Certainly, there was no obvious advantage in terms of results to having him in the 72-man England back-up party.

Wayne Rooney didn’t stay calm or confident enough to take a good chance against Italy when it came along and England lost.

When the Uruguay match reached its conclusion, Gerrard made a costly error and the defenders didn’t react quickly enough to cover. Peters was trumpeted as someone who could make the difference in penalty shoot-outs but England didn’t even get that far. 

Disappointment: Peters was working with Liverpool before he joined up with the FA and England

Gurus: Peters with former British Cycling chief Sir Dave Brailsford in 2011

It’s the first really difficult spell Peters has endured in sport after a long run of success – he is consultant to Team GB’s cyclists and the physciatrist for Team Sky who boast Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins -  and it will be interesting to see how he handles it.

Peters became celebrated with his book The Chimp Paradox, modestly described on its own website as ‘a groundbreaking mind model’.

The testimonies from Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Gerrard are gushing. ‘Steve's been excellent. He is a specialist in what he does and a genius in that field, and is such an understanding guy.’

Gerrard said about his new guru: ‘He is the best. I’ve played my most consistent form for Liverpool and England since seeing Steve.’ Apart from slips and backward headers, presumably.

Peters inspired the GB cyclists who dominated the London Olympics and O’Sullivan credited him with turning his career around after bouts of depression.

At Liverpool’s training ground at Melwood, Rodgers would speak enthusiastically and at length about the methods Peters used to help Suarez with his severe anger management problems.

It involves controlling the part of the brain that works on animal instinct – the inner chimp – with the part that is rational. Peters is hailed as a ‘mind mechanic’ but in Natal, his efforts to change Suarez looked rather hollow and empty.

RONNIE O’SULLIVAN

Gifted snooker star who turned to Peters after depression left him unable to compete properly. Peters was in O’Sullivan’s dressing-room during this year’s world championship final against Mark Selby, which the underdog won 18-14

STEVE GERRARD

Always prone to self-doubt, Gerrard found Peters’ calm reassurance helpful as he reached the twilight of his career. But high-profile and important mistakes for club and country, against Chelsea and Uruguay, have left the Liverpool and England captain “broken” by his own admission

LUIS SUAREZ

Looked at one stage like being Peters’ biggest success. Suarez overcame racism and biting bans to be the Premier League’s star player last season. But now back to square one after sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Resurrection: Ronnie O'Sullivan is another who credits Peters with helping to rejuvenate his career

Hunger: Peters also worked closely with Luis Suarez during his time with Liverpool

SIR BRADLEY WIGGINS

Helped Wiggins become Britain’s first Tour de France winner and Olympic champion in 2012 but since then the rider has been riddled with injury and loss of form, and has been supplanted by Froome as the main rider for Team Sky

VICTORIA PENDLETON

British cyclist who was going to retire after the 2004 Olympics until she was persuaded otherwise by Peters. ‘I’m not a natural optimist, but Steve showed me there’s a positive in everything if you look for it,’ she said. Pendleton  went on to win Gold at the London Olympics

SIR CHRIS HOY

Peters was known as ‘head coach’ to the British cyclists at Beijing and London, such was his influence. Hoy won three golds in China at the 2008 Olympics and said: ‘"Without Steve I don't think I could have brought home triple gold.’

Spin doctor: Steve Peters also helped Victoria Pendleton during her cycling career

Golden boy: He also significantly helped Britain's most successful Olympic Sir Chris Hoy
