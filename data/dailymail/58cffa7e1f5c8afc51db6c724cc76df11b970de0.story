Women have branded its latest clothing ranges unfashionable, poor-fitting and confusingly sized.

So perhaps it is little wonder that Marks & Spencer’s clothing division  has reported its worst sales performance for three years.

The high street giant admitted a string of mistakes with its womenswear was behind the 10 per cent fall in profits.

The disappointing performance was 
highlighted by a surge in sales by budget fashion chain Primark, with 
hard-up consumers flocking to its cut-price clothing.

Primark said its rise in profits was 
thanks to the increasing numbers of middle-class converts – customers 
who might usually turn to M&S for their clothes.

Responding to M&S’s fall in 
pre-tax profit to £289.5million for the half-year from £321million in 
the same period the previous year, chief executive Marc Bolland said he 
had inherited a list of problems from his predecessor, Sir Stuart Rose.

He said these included the retailer’s 
computer systems, which were ‘not fit for purpose’ and the stores 
themselves, which ‘lacked inspiration’.

The Dutchman also said M&S’s 
website was poor, while its supply network was ‘complex and inflexible’ –
resulting in stores running out of stock on popular items.

On its website – which allows 
customers to leave reviews of the clothing they have bought – there are a
string of complaints about the quality of some of the fabrics used in 
the clothing, and the ‘inconsistent’ sizing which has left many women 
confused.

Some styles are also branded ‘uncomfortable’, ‘frumpy’ and ‘unflattering’.

Yesterday M&S said it had taken decisive action to turn the clothing division around and back key fashion trends.

Mr Bolland said a lingerie range 
designed by supermodel and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had shifted
more than 100,000 pieces since the end of August, making it one of the 
fastest-selling ever.

Mr Bolland has also overhauled the 
retailer’s clothing team, hiring former Debenhams and Jaeger boss 
Belinda Earl to revitalise womenswear and Janie Schaffer – who formerly 
worked at Victoria’s Secret – as the new director of lingerie.

He made a barbed jibe at Primark’s 
success – saying M&S would focus on quality when it launches its own
version of ‘fast fashion’, adding: ‘We are not interested in disposable
clothing ranges.’

But Primark supremo George Weston, 
buoyed by a 15 per cent rise in sales to £3.5billion for the year, 
snapped back, saying: ‘We don’t look on ours being disposable either – 
what makes us difficult to compete with is our quality which is good, 
particularly on basics like T-shirts, underwear, nightwear and towels. 
Our quality stands in comparison with anyone out there.’

Mr Weston, boss of Primark’s owner 
Associated British Foods, said he had even had to increase the number of
tills by a third in Primark stores to take shoppers’ cash.

But both retailers warned recent 
trading had been tough, with Mr Bolland warning the market was 
‘volatile’ and the second half of the year would be tough as retailers 
tried to outdo each other with price-cutting promotions.

Critiqued: Drop-a-Dress-Size Floral-Print Silhouette Stretch Dress is a bad fit, customer reviews say

M&S customers’ dissatisfaction with many of the retailer’s products is shown in the reviews they have written on its website, which include:

Bootcut Denim Crystal jeans £32.50 ‘They dragged on the ground when I walked and the hem was about two to three inches wide and very heavy. I used to have perfect length fit from jeans from Marks and Spencer, what has happened?’

2-Pack: Assorted  Padded T-Shirt Bras £22.50 ‘Does anyone try these on at the design stage? These look great and are the right size BUT, and it’s a big BUT, the straps are so far out towards your shoulders they cut into your arms. Unless you walk around behaving as though you have a coat hanger down the back of your shirt, they are really uncomfortable.’

Drop-a-Dress-Size Floral-Print Silhouette Stretch Dress with Secret Support £59.00 ‘Really like the style but the 8 was too tight and the 10 too big. Had to return.’

Body-Shape Denim Lana Straight-Leg Jeans £25.00 ‘I don’t know how I managed to get these so wrong! I’m usually a 12 medium but when I tried these on they were two inches too short, low on the waist so gave me a muffin top where I don’t really have one.’ ‘A great fit... for about two hours. After four hours of wearing them they were falling down and I quite literally stepped out of them without undoing them... needless to say they have gone back. Come on Marks, get it right! Try some quality-control before you put them on the shelves.’

Per Una Abstract-Print Gathered Pleat Dress £39.50 ‘This had to be returned as it didn’t fit correctly. Disappointed with the sizing – no continuity! Two other dresses ordered with this one, all different styles and all three had to be returned as didn’t fit.’

Per Una Gathered-Waist Paisley Print Dress £45.00 ‘The dress was very nice but didn’t fit me well, was large across the top so the neck hung awkwardly at the front. I went into the store and tried a size smaller, but although it was a bit too tight, the neck part was still too loose.’

Limited Collection  Contrast Trim Blouse £29.50 ‘Lovely blouse but cut very straight and I found it gaped too much around the bust area.’

Per Una 3D Appliqué Pencil Skirt £45.00 ‘This is not good; the fabric has a very “man-made” feel to it; it is rather unflatteringly clingy and the so-called appliqué is not! It is devoré and not well done. I was disappointed and it went straight back.’

Per Una Slash-Neck Paisley-Print Dress £39.50 ‘I had high expectations for this dress [pictured right], but was so very disappointed. Frumpy, tight across the chest and arms; even a size larger was too tight. Looks lovely on the model but awful on me! It was probably the most unflattering dress I have ever tried on.  A no-no!’
