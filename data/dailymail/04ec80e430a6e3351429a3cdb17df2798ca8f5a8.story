A man claims he has only 100 orgasms before he loses his ability to get an erection forever.

The 34-year-old, known only as ‘RLS’, says doctors have diagnosed him with a rare condition which means each time he ejaculates, scar tissue will form in his penis.

Eventually, the build up of scar tissue will mean he will no longer be able to achieve an erection, he says.

He claims he has seen a range of doctors who are unable to explain the cause of his condition.

A man claims doctors have said he only has 100 orgasms left before he loses his ability to get an erection forever. He apparently has a condition where hard scar tissue forms in his penis each time he is aroused, which will eventually make it impossible for his penis to become erect. Posed by model

They have called it ‘idiopathic fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa’ – which essentially means unexplained fibrous tissue - hard, scar tissue - forming in the penis.

However, doctors have told MailOnline that while fibrosis – the build up of scar tissue – in the penis which leads to impotence is possible, it would be impossible to predict the exact number of orgasms a man would have before his penis ‘stopped working’.

In a post on the website BroBible, RLS, who lives in the U.S., said he has now seen the ‘full battery of experts’ and specialists.

He said: ‘Basically, there’s a reservoir in your penis that fills with blood when you have an erection. 

'In my case, every time I get one, it causes an autoimmune reaction [where the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue by mistake] which causes a scar tissue build-up in the reservoir.

‘Ultimately, the scar tissue will make it impossible to ever get [an erection] again.'

He has apparently been told he is the first case anyone has ever seen - and has left doctors baffled. 

Fibrosis of the penis is a symptom of a rare condition called Peyronie’s disease, which usually affects men over 40 years old – although it can happen to men of any age.

A thickened area or one or more hard lumps form in the shaft of the penis.

As a result, it can become curved, and men can experience pain during an erection, or are sometimes unable to get one. 

Doctors do not exactly what causes Peyronie’s disease, but it has been linked to an injury or repeated blows to the penis, and is associated with low testosterone levels.

But RLS says these explanations don’t apply to him.

The man says he has not worn briefs or experienced an injury to his genitalia, so doctors are baffled as to what is causing the build up of scar tissue 

He says he doesn’t wear briefs or use saunas, and has experienced no blunt force to his genitals - and so his case has baffled doctors. 

In his post, RLS says he has now accepted he will eventually lose his ability to get an erection, after trying every therapy possible.

He said: ‘I’m 34 years old and I have a finite amount of real, working, orgasm-capable erections remaining. They estimate I have about a hundred nuts left.’

Despite trying every conceivable therapy and medication available, nothing works, he says.

Therefore, he says he has been through the ‘five stages of grief’ and accepted he will be impotent in future.

But while he is able to accept his fate, he says he still doesn’t know how to cope with it.

He has to refrain from masturbation, and feels he needs to be selective with women.

He said: ‘Lately, I’m terrified of sex itself. I slept with one woman since the diagnosis, but when she wanted to go for a second round, a wave of incredible panic swept over me.

‘I burst into a cold sweat and my chest felt like it was gonna cave in on itself.

‘Since then I’ve been chaste as a nun, but I toss and turn all night with crazy, disturbing sex dreams, and now I’m worried that I’ll lose a nut to a wet dream.’

He is now searching for others that might be suffering from the same condition, and wants to start a dialogue about how men can cope with the knowledge they might be impotent in the near future.

But doctors contacted by MailOnline said they were sceptical about RLS’ diagnosis. 

Professor Raj Persad, a consultant urologist at Bristol Royal Infirmary, said he was not convinced.

He told MailOnline: ‘“Idiopathic” means “unexplained”. There are conditions like fibrosis which makes blood flow to the penis impossible.

‘But there are lots of causes of fibrosis, such as trauma.

‘There would always be a cause of fibrosis in such a young man, and doctors should be able to find it.

‘It sounds like his problem is either psychogenic, or he’s suffering from Peyronie’s disease.’ 

Another urologist told MailOnline it would be ‘impossible’ to predict how many times a man with fibrosis could ejaculate before suffering erectile dysfunction. 

And Dr Ian Eardley, a consultant urologist at Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust and a spokesperson for The Urology Foundation, said RLS’ diagnosis sounded ‘implausible’.

He told MailOnline: 'You can get fibrosis and scarring, usually caused by blood flow problems to the penis.

‘But it wouldn’t stop him ejaculating as that’s a different mechanism.

‘Blood flow isn’t related to usage – fibrosis wouldn’t be made worse by sex, in fact it might improve.

‘There is blood flow through the penis all the time. 

'Therefore it's difficult to conceive why getting an erection would cause an autoimmune reaction to blood, when it’s flowing through the penis all the time.

‘Ejaculation and erection are two separate mechanisms. If you get fibrosis you may lose an erection. There are men with fibrosis who can climax and ejaculate but they can’t get an erection.

‘It’s possible he has Peyronie’s disease, but that’s normally in much older men and it’s very rare.

'However there is a theory that Peyronie’s disease has an autoimmune function.'
