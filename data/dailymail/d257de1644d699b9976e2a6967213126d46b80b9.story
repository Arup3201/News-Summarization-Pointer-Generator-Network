The champagne had just been smashed against the hull and the proud buyer was preparing to take ownership of his gleaming new $10million yacht.

But moments later disaster struck when the 90ft expedition vessel capsized almost as soon as it left the slipway.

Newly released video shows the accident unfold as celebrations quickly turn to shock when the boat tilts to one side and then plunges to one side, knocking into the side of the marina.

Off balance: A $10million yacht tilts perilously to one side as soon as it is launched at a marina in Washington

Danger: Workers look on in horror as the yacht lists further to one side at the Cap Sante Marina in Anacortes

Witnesses
 said the brand-new 90ft yacht, named Baden was launched at the Cap Sante 
Marina in Anacortes after being built for an owner who planned to circumnavigate the globe.

The six 
people on board were helped ashore by onlookers and one person had to 
be rescued from the bilge at the bottom of the boat.

Coast Guard Petty Officer Jordan Akiyama says two were checked out at a hospital.

KOMO reports a boom has been placed around the yacht as a precaution but there's no sign of a fuel spillage.

The yacht is reportedly worth $10million and was being delivered to its new owner when it capsized.Â

Northern Marine in Anacortes was the builder of the boat, which had just been purchased.

According to witnesses, the water was completely calm and flat at the time of the capsize.

'The
 boat tilted to one side, and although not unusual, the amount of tilt 
was a bit more than normal,' Wes Fridell of Northern Marine told KIRO-TV.

'So
 we paused to collect ourselves and assure that everything was going to 
be right, and then as we continued to lower it down, it pitched, and 
that's when it went over.'

The company that built the boat will be responsible for the cost of the salvage operation.

The buyer of the boat told KIRO-TV that they are 'absolutely heartbroken' by the boat's capsize.

Investigations into the accident are 
continuing, but it is thought the dolly carrying the weight of the port 
side dropped off during the launch, causing the ship to list to one 
side.

In a 
statement, the company Northern Marine said: 'Since the casualty, there 
has been much speculation as to what happened, often with little or no 
supporting evidence.

'Northern
 Marine has launched more than 35 vessels, ranging from 57ft to 151ft 
motoryachts, with all of its trawler models having been launched using 
transport dollies at the same ramp where the accident occurred on the 
18th (of May).

'Northern
 Marine continues to have complete confidence in its trawler designs, 
all of which have been tank-tested and passed the same United States 
Coast Guard stability standards applied to commercial fishing vessels 
operating in the North Pacific.'
