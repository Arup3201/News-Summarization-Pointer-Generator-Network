Sir Cyril Smith, the ultimate political heavyweight, is not the first person you would associate with the modern obsession of exercise and keeping fit.

Yet the massive 29-stone former Liberal Democrat, who needed eight yards of material for his suits, will be remembered in his home town of Rochdale after councillors decided to dedicate a sports centre in his honour.

The politician's name will live on in the Greater Manchester area when the 'The Sir Cyril Smith Sports Complex' opens its doors next year.

Big idea: Sir Cyril Smith has had a sports centre named after him in his home town of Rochdale

A one-time fiery contender for the leadership of the party he died aged 82 in September last year.

The renaming of the town's sports centre after the former mayor, who had a 75-inch waistline, came about after town hall chiefs asked for suggestions for the name of their revamped sports centre.

Rochdale councillor Dale Mulgrew, Sir Cyril's godson, was responsible for the dedication idea.

But it has sparked anger in the town with opponents declaring it 'daft' to name a sports facility after such an overweight public figure.

Sir Cyril 
Smith was known for his larger-than-life personality forged out of a 
difficult upbringing as an illegitimate child, when such things still 
mattered.

He is believed to be Britain's heaviest MP, peaking at 29 stone and 12 pounds (about 190 kilograms).

His nickname, 'Big Cyril', was 
also the title of his autobiography.

A common joke on the size of the 
Parliamentary Liberal Party in the early 1970s was that only one taxi 
would be needed to transport the entire party; after Smith's election, 
the party could fill two taxis.

After
a lifetime of public service, which included a spell as Mayor of 
Rochdale with his mother as Mayoress, he died in his sleep in a nursing 
home weighing just ten stone following a battle with cancer.

Meanwhile Councillor Mulgrew has defended the naming decision and said: 'Apart from the plaque that we intend to unveil outside the town hall 
next month, which really is no more than a small civic commemoration, 
the town won't have a totemic, significant memorial in lasting tribute 
to Cyril's work.

'After all, Gracie Fields has a theatre.

'Clearly, a lot of Cyril's work over his time was around education, and 
clearly the new leisure centre will have a schools dimension because it 
will be used during the day by our local education establishments.

'This
is about a lasting memorial, irrespective of the facility, and Cyril 
would have promoted the community and social aspects of this building.'

Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk added: 'It just goes to show how out of touch Rochdale Lib Dems have become. Even Cyril would have thought this was a daft idea.'

The centre, which will open next year, will have an eight-lane 25-metre swimming pool, a learner pool with a moveable floor, a sports hall, thermal and fitness suites, dance studios and a youth gym.

Sir Cyril, a bachelor who once said he was 'married to politics', served as Rochdale's MP from 1972 until his retirement in 1992.

He won the seat by securing a huge swing away from Labour - becoming only the seventh Liberal MP in parliament at the time.

Sir Cyril, who was knighted in 1988, remained active within the Liberal Democrats until only a few months before his death.
