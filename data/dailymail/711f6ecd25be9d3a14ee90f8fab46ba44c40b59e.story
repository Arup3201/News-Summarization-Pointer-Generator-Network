Second wife: Leslie Phillips with Angela Scoular

At 89, Leslie Phillips wants to make the most of every moment.

Which is why tomorrow he is to marry for the third time.

The veteran comedy actor has fallen for Turkish social worker Zara Carr, a friend who was a ‘source of great strength’ to him as he coped with the death of his second wife.

Phillips said he has known Miss Carr,
 who is half his age, for more than ten years and they had developed a 
‘nurturing relationship’.

‘I’ve
 had some very dark moments in the last few years, but as Zara and I 
spent more and more time together, I came to realise there is life yet 
to live,’ he said.

Last
 night he told how the death this week of his old friend, Peter O’Toole,
 had spurred on his decision to make Miss Carr, said by friends to be in
 her forties, his third wife.

‘Zara
 is a wonderful woman, who not only looks good but has an amazing 
brain,’ he said. ‘I love her very much. I suddenly realised I don’t have
 much time and want to make the most of every moment.

‘We were friends for many years – she lived nearby and we always enjoyed each other’s company.

‘Then,
 after my wife died, we started to see more of each other and struck up a
 lovely companionship.’ Phillips has had a long and tangled romantic 
life.

His first 
marriage was to actress Penelope Bartley, in  May 1948. The couple had 
four children, Caroline, Claudia, Andrew and Roger. He and Miss Bartley 
divorced in 1965.

After another relationship with actress Vicki Luke, he fell in love with former Bond girl Angela Scoular, 21 years his junior. Phillips’s first wife Penny had been crippled by a stroke and he and Miss Scoular looked after her until her death in a house fire in 1981.

They married in 1982 and remained together until Miss Scoular’s death in 2011. The couple did not have any children together, but Phillips brought up Miss Scoular’s son, Daniel.

Miss Scoular suffered from manic depression and was battling terminal bowel cancer when she took her own life in 2011.

Phillips, best known for his roles in the Carry On films and the ‘Doctor’ comedies, said Zara had helped him cope with the loss of his wife.

The couple will marry in a register office in the West End followed by a blessing at a London church.

‘We enjoy our time together and she makes me very happy,’ he said.

‘We have a deep connection but we’ve planned things sensibly – it’s not a whirlwind romance. When he was asked how old his fiancee is, Phillips replied: ‘I’m not too sure!’
