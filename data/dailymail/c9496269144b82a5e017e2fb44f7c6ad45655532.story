On the whole us Brits have got a bad reputation overseas.

Whether it's lounging by the pool shouting up to your friend's hotel balcony, spilling beer like it's water or lunging at anything in a skirt,   being in a foreign clime becomes like a passport to loose behaviour.

From Lanzarote to Majorca and Thailand to Beirut, our strange whims, afternoon drinking sessions and often total disregard for local custom means we stick out like a sore thumb.

Unsurprisingly then, a study by TravelSupermarket  found that out of all  nationalities, Britons think their fellow countrymen are the most likely to stand out as tourists  on holiday, Germans came a close second.

Over a third felt they would have a more 'authentic' travel experience if they blended in better with the locals. For those who care, here are a few obvious pointers of where you are going wrong.

There's little wonder us Brits have got a bad rep overseas - we stick out like a sore thumb. If there's one thing we're not, it's inconspicuous... 

Keep your clothes on

In general, unless  on a beach, this is a good code to live by. Who wants to see nipples at lunch? Last year the German newspaper Bild ran an article dissecting the atypical Brit abroad. 

It was titled 'Bild explains the English Patients (of Majorca)' and one of the charges  leveled against us was something called 'Prince Harry syndrome', or the 'pathological need constantly to undress'. They also described British women as  suffering from 'underwear amnesia'. 

Remember where you left your underwear, be mindful of local customs and cultures (especially around places of worship) and (to help you with the point below)  keep your shirt on where possible.

Brits will shed their clothes at the merest hint of a sunny day, so expect copious amount of fleshy mounds once they hit the beach. German newspaper Bild has described this phenomenon as 'the pathological need constantly to undress', which seems a little harsh

Wear sun cream 

Nothing says I'm a Brit abroad like sun burn. Even if you haven't seen sunshine for the best part of a year it's best to pretend you know what you are doing.

A  Superdrug poll found that nine million Brits get sunburn every single time they go abroad and one in ten admit to burning twice on the same holiday. Inflamed, beetroot skin is not only horribly uncomfortable but it makes you look like a complete rookie. 

Sunscreen is cheating! Lobster pink skin never has been, and never will be, a good look, yet many Brits still refuse to cover up or slap on the sunscreen

Tip: suncream can often be bought more cheaply in the country you are travelling to so resist the £10 bottle at the airport and buy some at the nearest supermarket.

Don't be a yob 

The international community views Brits as a loud, abrasive, heckling bunch of hee-hawing numpties. We don't bother to learn the local language, preferring to speak English increasingly loudly and slowly until we get what we want.

Being polite goes a long way. Learn some local words, chat to your waiter, hotel manager or fellow guests and always be courteous. As your mother told you, manners cost nothing.

Drinking 

Almost as obligatory as showing your boarding pass to cabin crew is the British airport drink, or ten. Never mind that it's 8am and the Heathrow Wetherspoons hasn't opened. You'll find a drink and, probably, won't stop until you return home.

If there's one thing Brits abroad are good at, it's drinking. By the pool, in the pool, or even down a tube, we'll guzzle just about anything with a minimum 40% alcohol content

Studies show that half of British holidaymakers drink alcohol every day on summer breaks - and one in three  admit to boozing in the departure lounge. It's pretty likely that even Brits trekking to Machu Picchu will be weighed down by vodka.

Save yourself a horrible injury, a misjudged fling or jail time and sip rather than guzzle. 

Around half of Brits admit to drinking every day while they're on holiday, and one in three admit to boozing in the departure lounge. It's OK to take a day or two off, promise...

Union Jacks

Just in case locals  missed you doing any, or all, of the above, you can be sure to let them know of your proud heritage by splattering Union Jacks across all your holiday gear. 

This is the perfect way to show other what a hopeless foreigner you are, how ripe you are for pick pockets and opportunistic salesmen. Worst offending items  are towels, shorts, hats and bags. Just leave it behind or, better yet, don't buy it in the first place.

You'll never guess where I'm from? Brits love to advertise their heritage via tacky Union Jack holiday accessories. Just put it away, please!

Ridiculous hats 

Brits abroad and silly hats are like moths to a flame. Sombreros, handkerchiefs tied into knots and promotional pork pie headgear might protect your head from the sun but they do nothing for your image.

Fry ups

If there is a time and a place for a fry up it is not while watching the sun rise behind the French Riviera or after a night sipping cocktails on a remote Malaysian island.

If we're not on the sauce, we're probably sloshing it all over a hearty Great British fry up. Our ability to chow down a hot plate of bacon, sausages and eggs in sweltering heat is the stuff that legends are made of

It's almost impressive how diligently Brits abroad force down a hot plate of beans, sausages, eggs and bacon even in sweltering 30 degree heat. 

A international survey by hotels.com revealed the full English fry up to be the world's favourite breakfast. It also found that a quarter of us take teabags, brown sauce and even bacon with us when travelling. 

Adventurous Brits love to sample the local cuisine when they're abroad. Did you know that McDonald's now has restaurants in 120 countries around the world? The possibilities are mind-blowing...

But part of visiting another country means trying new things, food included, and breakfast is the perfect place to start.

Socks and sandals 

Just because Bruce Willis and David Beckham have been spotted sporting this confusing sartorial statement doesn't give you a right to. It's not ironic, it's not practical and it will give you sock marks.

There is simply no excuse for pairing socks with your sandals. Ever. 

Britain has a rich history of sock and sandal wearing, mostly from those north of 50, and last summer there was  a moment when fashion commentators tried to persuade us it was a good look after Prada and Louis Vuitton catwalks showed them together. 

Still, there's no quicker way to look like a very British idiot abroad than by wearing them.
