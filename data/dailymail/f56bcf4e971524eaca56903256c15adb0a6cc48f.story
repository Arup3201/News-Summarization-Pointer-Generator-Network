A husband who rented a billboard in an attempt to find his wife a new kidney says he is reminded of her every time he drives by the sign he rented to try and save her life.

Jim Nelson's wife Sharon, from Salinas, Kansas, was on a transplant waiting list, before the couple decided to take matters into their own hands.

They decided to head out onto the highway where Mr Nelson climbed up onto the board to paint their message.

Wanted: A Kansas couple decided to take matters into their own hands. Sharon Nelson, 73, and her husband James, 70, rented a billboard on Interstate 70 in Jewell, to advertise Sharon’s plight for a new kidney

Experienced: Jim, a Vietnam veteran and former mural painter, borrowed a 12-foot ladder and painted 'I Need A Kidney' along with his phone number on the white billboard

Tedious: Sharon Nelson had been in and out of hospitals since she was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 2008, and since 2009 she had been on dialysis because the cancer treatment damaged her kidneys

On an overcast morning last December, Jim parked his truck on the side of Interstate 70, gathered a few supplies and headed over to a blank billboard he had leased a day earlier, at a discount from a friend. 

Mr Nelson, a Vietnam veteran and former mural painter, borrowed a12-foot ladder and painted 'I Need A Kidney?' along with his phone number. 

'We decided it was worth a try,' she said. 'It was so cold when he was on the ladder. The ladder was unstable because the ground was uneven. I was in the pickup, ready to call 911 if he fell off.' Mrs Nelson said.

Although his wife died just a few weeks ago, his cause and effort to find his beloved a transplant was a valiant one. 

Mrs Nelson had been in and out of hospitals since she was diagnosed withbone marrow cancer in 2008, and since 2009 she had been on dialysis.

Jim dedicated himself to learning everything there was to know about kidney donations.

Hoping: Numerous people came forward looking to donate a kidney but none of the offers crystallized

Last chance: Jim painted the sign last December. He climbed a ladder and began painting the sign he hoped would save his wife’s life

New lease: The sign, and everything that followed it, seemed to rejuvenate Sharon, who had borne years of treatment. She seemed to get great joy out of her conversations with callers, making at least one new friend

Depair: For all the calls they received, for all the kind words and prayers and encouragement, no concrete leads materialized and Sharon passed away in September 

A final goodbye: In September, Sharon’s health took a turn for the worse. Jim told her how he felt about her but held out hope

When Sharon began using a home dialysis system, he learned how to help operate it, and when home dialysis was no longer possible, he drove her 65 miles round trip to the hospital in Concrodia, three times a week, so it could be done there.

Between treatments, he tried to keep her as comfortable as possible. He made up a little bed in the backseat of the couple's car, with pillows and blankets, and drove her to one of the local fairs

In 2010 she began considering a transplant and the search for a potential donor began.

She was then approved for a transplant in February. but the search for a matching donor wasn't easy.

Sharon had type O blood, and she can only receive a kidney from a donor with the same blood type, 

In the months before her death, numerous people got in touch hoping to help out, but none were a match. 

Several volunteered to be her donor but none were acceptable candidates, others called to let Jim and Sharon know that they were thinking about them, praying for them. 

Most, though, offered their own kidneys, assuming it was feasible.

'One of the people, who is a perfect blood match, had had tuberculosis, so they were unable to donate and the other phone calls have been the wrong blood type,' she said.

'We have had a great number of phone calls,' she said. 'It is an impulsive thing, offering to give your kidney. We have been very grateful. It was a wonderful response and our community has been very supportive.'

In the weeks after the sign went up, it all seemed possible. Jim started to feel like his idea might actually work and that it was only a matter of time before the right person saw it.

The sign, and everything that followed it, seemed to rejuvenate Sharon, and she enjoyed chatting with callers. 

'She was her old self again,' Jim says. 'Just chipper and positive-thinking, and just upbeat.'

But days turned into week and weeks turned into months.

No regrets: In the weeks since the funeral, Jim had tried to come to grips with the loss. He still blames and wonders if there was something else he could have done to save his wife's life

Moving on: The sign on the Interstate is gone and so is his wife, but he is left with a lifetime of happy memories 

Jim pursued any option he could think of. He wrote letters to universities that were on the cutting edge of kidney research. He called different institutions, trying to get Sharon into experimental programs but it made no difference.

In September, Sharon's health took a turn for the worse and after coming down with a fever and chills she passed away one fall afternoon.

As Jim come attempted to come to terms with the loss of his wife he keeps wondering if there was something more he could have done. 

His message on the sign is gone now.

He parked his truck on the side of I-70 to paint the sign away.

As he did so, he wiped the tears from his eyes, thankful for the time he and his wife got to spend with one another, grateful for the kindness of strangers, and happy thinking of the times that will live long in the memory.
