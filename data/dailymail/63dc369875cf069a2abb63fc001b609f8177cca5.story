Welcome to modern football, the Glazer family. Welcome to the game everyone else plays — are you ready for what lies ahead?

Manchester United’s owners have had it easy since they arrived here in 2005. They relied upon the genius of Sir Alex Ferguson to keep producing teams who enabled them to stay at the top.

Their ownership has resulted in five Premier League titles, three League Cups and a Champions League but those trophies had nothing to do with bold statements in the transfer market. They were down to the inspiration of Ferguson.

Success: Sir Alex Ferguson ensured a continuous flow of trophies despite Man Utd's relatively modest net spend

History: Now Sir Alex Ferguson has retired, Man United are going to have spend more to be competitive

Now, with United facing a  huge fight to get into the top four, they need a new approach. They need to show they are prepared to spend. The clubs who stay at the head of the game invest in the future from positions of strength, which is why the signing of Juan Mata is intriguing.

Is this a pointer to the future or simply a break from the norm?

Do not think for one moment the £37million paid for Mata will cure all United’s ills. To get back to where they were under Ferguson, dominating domestically and constantly posing a threat in Europe, they need another three or four of those transfers.

Goodbyes: Man United need to spend more money than the £37million Juan Mata they will pay Chelsea for Juan Mata

New challenge: Juan Mata will be hoping to spend more time on the pitch for Man Utd than he did at Chelsea

United have never been afraid of spending but since the last time they broke their transfer record — for Dimitar Berbatov (£30.75m) in 2008, four months after they won the Champions League in Moscow — their rivals have been bold.

The Glazers, by contrast, have been complacent and the evidence across Europe stacks up against them — none of the clubs they want to compete with have hesitated when it comes to paying massive fees.

Real Madrid have gone beyond £80m twice since 2009; last summer Barcelona paid £51m for Neymar; Paris Saint-Germain went higher to get Edinson Cavani, as did Monaco when they landed Radamel Falcao.

Record: Real Madrid were prepared to spend £86 on Gareth Bale last summer, a world-record fee

Previous highest fee: Dimitar Berbatov held the record for the biggest Man Utd transfer fee, at £30.75m, before Mata

Quality does not come cheaply and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge explained to me in December the moment Bayern Munich realised they would be fighting an uphill battle if they didn’t follow the lead of others and spend big.

It revolved around the Spain midfielder Javi Martinez. Bayern were debating spending €40m, but ultimately the question came down to, ‘Would he make a difference?’

The answer was ‘Yes’ and Martinez ended up playing a key role in Bayern winning the Treble.

Other than Robin van Persie, how many players capable of making a difference have United bought since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009?

In that time, their net spend has been £68m, dwarfed by the likes of Real Madrid (£307m), Chelsea (£306m) and Manchester City (£367). Even Stoke (£72.5m) have spent more.

Mata will make a difference to United. If he produces the numbers he did for Chelsea — he has been directly involved in 45 goals (scored 18, assisted 27) since 2011 — then they have a chance of pegging back Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton in the race for the top four.

His arrival will also lift a squad who are on their knees following the latest setback against Sunderland; nothing beats seeing a quality addition walk into the dressing room and David Moyes will hope Mata can do for his squad what Eric Cantona did for Ferguson in 1992 — add quality and galvanise those around him.

But the men who hold the key to United’s future are the Glazers. Are they going to stand up to the challenges of modern football, or are they going to coast along without any real spending?

If they choose the latter option, this season is unlikely to prove a one-off.

Thrills at the top, chills at the bottom

The most exciting Premier League season of recent years has had the unusual impact of removing a word we use frequently from our conversations — mid-table.

Think about it: the League is so open that practically every club in the top flight has something to play for with 16 games left and nobody is just drifting along.

Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are fighting to be champions; the four teams below them are involved in a tremendous scrap to secure the final Champions League place, while eighth-placed  Newcastle will feel they can still qualify for the Europa League.

Table toppers: Arsenal currently lead the way in the Premier League, one point ahead of Man City

Threat: Cardiff, scoring here against Man City, may be bottom of the table, but can still trouble the top teams

Aston Villa are 10th with 24 points, but given that bottom club Cardiff have 18, not one team in that pack will be able to relax, with the fear of relegation haunting them. That just leaves Southampton, who are ninth with 31 points, looking isolated.

Of course, the situation will change over the coming weeks but as we look  forward to another round of matches in midweek, it is brilliant to see such interest being generated. You only have to think back to this stage 12 months ago when everyone knew Queens Park Rangers and Reading were going down and Manchester United effectively had the title sewn up. What we have now is what football should be all about. 
.................................................................................................................................No excuses if Sunderland drop

Sunderland fully deserve their first trip to Wembley since 1992 and they should enjoy every minute of the Capital One Cup final.

In no way, though, should their progress in this competition be used as an excuse for the position they currently occupy in the Premier League table — and if they end up being relegated in May, they should not compare themselves to either Birmingham or Wigan.

Birmingham, of course, went down in 2011 after dramatically winning the League Cup. But when they beat Arsenal at Wembley, they had two games in hand on their relegation rivals and were just one win away from going 10th in the table.

Ecstasy: The Sunderland players celebrate after their League Cup penalty shootout joy against Man Utd

No excuses: Given some of the results Sunderland have had this season, they should beat the drop

Complacency — they took just nine points from the final 12 games — led to Birmingham’s season unravelling. Wigan’s situation was different as all their high-pressure games came at the end of last season and it eventually it became emotionally and physically draining; remember, they played in the FA Cup final four days before they had to go to Arsenal and win to stand any chance of surviving. Sunderland, by contrast, will have plenty of time after the March 2 final to try to save their top-flight status.

A team who have beaten Manchester City and Everton in the Premier League, and knocked Manchester United and Chelsea out of the Capital One Cup, clearly have the talent to stay up.If they fail to do that, they will only have themselves to blame because they shouldn’t have any other distraction.

My top five... FA Cup potential shocks

The fourth-round draw might be lacking a blockbuster tie but that does not mean the FA Cup will be a breeze this weekend for the Premier League sides in action.

If anything, the opposite will be true as plenty of teams in the lower divisions will be out to make a statement.

1 BIRMINGHAM v SWANSEA

It has been alarming to see Swansea’s 
form tail off so badly and Michael Laudrup will see this fixture as a 
chance to restore some confidence. Birmingham City, though, will have 
other ideas and will be looking for Lee Novak to get into dangerous 
areas.

2 BOLTON v CARDIFF

Cardiff sprang a surprise at Newcastle
 in the last round but their form since has been poor and Bolton, in 
need of a lift after being thrashed 7-1 at Reading, could upset them.

Mark Davies, back last month from a cruciate injury, can dictate in the Bolton midfield.

3 SOUTHEND v HULL

Roots Hall is a compact little 
stadium, the type you associate with giant-killings, and this tie has 
the ingredients for another — not least as Southend manager Phil Brown  
is taking on his old club.

Hull will have to keep an eye on Southend’s leading scorer, Kevan Hurst.

4 WIGAN v CRYSTAL PALACE

The holders survived a scare against MK Dons and now they will be aiming to create a shock of their own.

Crystal Palace have done well since Tony Pulis took over but it will be difficult for them at the DW.

5 SHEFF UTD v FULHAM

After dumping Aston Villa out in the 
last round, Sheffield United under Nigel Clough will fancy their chances
 of making the last 16, especially with home advantage.

Fulham are vulnerable with relegation fears on their mind.
