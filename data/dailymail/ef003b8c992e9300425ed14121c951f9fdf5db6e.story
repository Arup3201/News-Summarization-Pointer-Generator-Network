A mother has lost 12 stone in nine months after her children begged her to take control of her weight.

Annette Skinner, 46, shrunk from a size 32 to a size 14 after her son Alex came home upset that she didn't look like other mothers.

Her daughter Kelly, 25, was also concerned her mother's weight would restrict Alex's upbringing, and he too would be bullied as she had been as a child.

At her peak, Annette, from Walsall, 
weighed 25st 10lb. She says she was so big that people didn't realise she was pregnant with Alex.

Annette Skinner was nearly 26 stone when her children begged her to lose weight. She has since lost more than 12 stone and now runs regularly

She told MailOnline: 'I have never been skinny, but over the years, because I was happy and "comfortable", I just piled on the pounds. 

'Chocolate was my biggest downfall – I got through
a few big bars of Galaxy a day. Any junk food I opened, I had to 
finish.

‘I was basically in total denial – it was the story of my life. I became a hermit of my own making, never 
seeing what other people saw.

'Maybe that was because I never looked 
below my neckline in the mirror. As stupid as that sounds, it’s true.

Annette, who now weighs 13 stone, with daughter Kelly and son Alex. She says chocolate was her biggest downfall. 'I got through a few big bars of Galaxy a day. Any junk food I opened, I had to finish'

‘I’d tried loads of diets, but even if I lost weight, I would always put it back on – and some.'

Over the years, Annette's family had voiced their concerns about her weight and her health - she was often breathless and suffered from sore knees. 'I refused to go to social events that 
would put me in situations where my weight would be the topic on 
everyone’s lips.

'And instead of listening to my husband Kevin when he was trying 
to help me, I would just bite his head off by saying: “if you don’t 
like it, you know where the door is!”

'He was just worried about me, but I always had to retaliate. I think the amount of weight I had to lose just seemed so much that it was a mountain I didn't think I could face climbing.

The turning point came when Annette’s daughter Kelly sat her down to voice her fears about her mother’s health.

Annette's daughter Kelly says she was bullied at school for having the 'fat mum' and didn't want her brother Alex to suffer a similar fate

Annette says she often felt breathless and had sore knees due to her weight

‘She said she didn’t want Alex to feel the same way she had growing up – not being able to join in with normal activities a child should do.

‘Growing up she was the one in the class that could never go to swimming parties as I would never go in the pool with her. She was also bullied at school for having the "fat" mum. 

'We couldn't do the simplest of activities such as going to the park due to me being short of breath or as the mother-daughter shopping trips that she watched all my friends doing.'

To add to her guilt, the next day Alex came home from school and dropped his own bombshell.

'He came in and said: "Mummy, why can’t you look like other mummies?”

Annette and Kelly now exercise together regularly and say they have a much closer relationship

‘It quite honestly broke my heart. I was in pieces and something inside me just switched and I thought “this really needs to happen”. 

At this point, Annette had been a member of her local Fitness First gym for a year, having been bought a membership the year before by her mother.

Annette says: 'I would go, but make any excuse to do as little as I could. I would also convince myself I had "exercised" – and that gave me a right to eat what I wanted - even if I'd just done five minutes of walking.

‘My confidence was also so low that I had the constant fear of everyone staring at the fat lady on the treadmill.

‘Now I know that most people don’t give two hoots about other people in the gym – we’re all there for the same reason.'

But on 1st August 2011, Annette took the bull by the horns and began her exercise programme. 'I decided to get a personal trainer to kick me a kick start,' she says.

'He asked me "what do you want to 
achieve", and I said “I just want to look normal” – the last time I had 
looked normal was when I was a teenager.’

Her
initial sessions with Paul, her personal trainer, were ‘very hard 
work’, involving a combination of walking and the bike. She then went on
to have three sessions a week.

‘He
never put me on a diet – he just gave me tips on how to eat healthily. 
There was no crash dieting as I just knew that wouldn’t be sustainable 
in the long term. 

‘I lost two stone straight away because I was so big, then around one stone a month.’

Annette with her mother - who initially bought her the gym membership. For the first year, she admits she was in denial and would go for just five minutes each time

Annette now weighs 13 stone and due to exercising three times a week, had also managed to keep the weight off.

'That has actually been much harder than losing the weight,' she says. Now I see Paul just once a week and the rest I do myself. 

'But I must stress you have to be in the right place when you start something like this - the reason I think I was so successful is because I really wanted it.

'Over the past year and a half I have seen the gym in a new light - I never believed walking through that door would change my life like it has. But thanks to Paul I am now half the woman I was. Last year I went to a party and some of my old school friends didn’t recognise me.'

Annette says she now feels terrible guilt for what she put her family through.

Her
daughter Kelly, who encouraged Annette by going to the gym with her, 
said: ‘My mum has been a “big” woman for as long as I can remember. 

‘She is such a loving, caring and giving human being but when I was growing up her large frame altered my 'normal' upbringing.

‘I was never deprived of anything that I needed but what she gave in love she lacked in other areas.

Annette says she is 'truly a new person. Not only by the way I look but also my confidence is sky high, from the woman who always looked at the floor, I now hold my head high'

‘The final straw was one year ago when 
my brother came home from school and said: “mummy, why don’t you look 
like the other mummy’s?" I could no longer stand the thought of my mum 
making my brother suffer the same fate that I did.

'I sat her down and 
told her my worries about her health and what my brother will miss out 
on should she not do anything about her weight.

'Since that day she has 
never looked back and watching her go from a size 32 to a 14 has been amazing.

‘She has lost more than my total weight and my brother’s height in inches. As a result we are a lot closer; we 
now workout together, we go shopping any chance we get and to top it all
off my brother has never missed one swimming party. I’m one very proud 
daughter.’

Annette agrees her weight loss has boosted her relationship, with Alex, too. 'We now go to the park, swimming and race along the road together. Last year I did a 5k run in 40 minutes – there’s no way I could have done that before. 

‘I can truly say I am a new person, not 
only by the way I look but also my confidence is sky high, from the 
woman who always looked at the floor, I now hold my head high.

‘The other day I caught sight of myself 
in the gym and didn’t recognise myself – there was someone normal 
staring back at me. I’ve basically lost a whole person in weight.

'My only regret is I never did this 
earlier. I am ashamed of
myself before and feel I was very selfish towards my family. For that, I truly apologise to my loved ones.'

Annette has been nominated for a New You Achievement Awards in the Inspiration category. This is offered to support all Fitness First members who have achieved something great over 2012.  For more information: www.newyouawards.co.uk/ and www.fitnessfirst.co.uk
