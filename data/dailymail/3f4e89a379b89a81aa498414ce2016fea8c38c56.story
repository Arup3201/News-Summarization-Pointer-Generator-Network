He is no stranger to controversy and has made headlines for his views on rape, paedophilia and aborting babies with Down’s syndrome.

Yesterday Professor Richard Dawkins turned his attention to the subject of people who set fireworks off all year round and the distress they cause animals.

The 73-year-old biologist unleashed a furious rant on-line after he claimed his beloved dogs were left terrorised by the loud bangs.

Taking to social network site Twitter, Prof Dawkins told his one million followers the explosions are no longer reserved for specific celebrations: ‘It isn’t Guy Fawkes Day. It isn’t New Year. It isn’t even a weekend. Why are there fireworks, terrifying the dogs and other non-human animals?’

Prof Dawkins, who taught at Oxford University until his retirement in 2008, added in a second Tweet: ‘Selfishly, I like fireworks. But I suspect that my dogs’ terror is typical of thousands of animals, tame and wild. Don’t you care about them?’

Prof Dawkins, an outspoken atheist, made his comments on Monday night, several days after Diwali, known as the festival of light and celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs, which saw scores of fireworks let off last week.

In theory the next set of rockets should not be expected until November 5 – when bonfire night marks Guy Fawkes’s unsuccessful plot to blow up Parliament in 1605.

Prof Dawkins takes to twitter to vent his spleen about the letting off of fireworks all year round

According to Prof Dawkins, this is no longer the case. He later tweeted: ‘Many replies to my firework tweet say it’s only 2 or 3 days a year. If only. In Oxford it’s most weekends and often (as now) weekdays too.’

The academic was flooded with support for his comments, made on Monday night, from dog owners across the world who called for firework displays to be restricted or banned.

One wrote: ‘We had to lock our dog in the bathroom with a fan running to dull the noise this year. Terrified of sounds for weeks after.’ Another posted: ‘My mother’s dog was diagnosed by the vet with a “stress reaction” related to fireworks on July 4 here in the US.’

Others told how their dogs had run away or been injured after being scared by the noise.

And many of Prof Dawkins’s followers from overseas shared their own nations’ rules on firework use, including in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada, where use of fireworks requires a permit to be obtained. Private displays are also prohibited in most of Australia.

In the UK, under the Fireworks Regulations 2004, anyone over the age of 18 can buy and use fireworks

One Twitter user wrote: ‘Believe it or not Prof, but even South Africa has banned private fireworks years ago in consideration to pets and animals.’

In the UK, under the Fireworks Regulations 2004, anyone over the age of 18 can buy and use fireworks. Some shops are only licensed to sell fireworks around special events, such as New Year, but others are licenced all year round.

According to the Dogs’ Trust, 66 per cent of dogs in the UK are frightened of fireworks.

A recent survey carried out by the charity found that 80 per cent of pet owners believe fireworks should be restricted to organised official displays.

Describing the distress fireworks can cause, a spokesman for the campaign group Peta said: ‘Richard Dawkins is absolutely right… [fireworks] can be a nightmare for animals as, from their perspective, it seems that World War III has suddenly broken out. The booms, bangs, pops and whizzes of Catherine wheels, Roman candles and other fireworks ignite fear, terror and panic in our beloved animal companions as well as in birds and other wildlife.’

Prof Dawkins did not elaborate on the number of dogs he owns during his Twitter discussion but in a photoshoot for a newspaper last year he was pictured clutching his dog Tycho. Another of his dogs called Pamba died five years ago.

Earlier this year the scientist said babies with Down’s syndrome should be aborted - and parents should ‘try again’.

He was also condemned by women and child abuse victims for referring to ‘mild date rape’ and ‘mild paedophilia’ in a Twitter discussion about ‘logical thinking’.
