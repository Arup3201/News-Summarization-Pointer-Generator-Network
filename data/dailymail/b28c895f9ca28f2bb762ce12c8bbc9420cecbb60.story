Former New York Knicks power forward Anthony Mason is in a critical condition tonight after a massive heart attack.

Retired NBA writer Peter Vecsey tweeted earlier Wednesday that the 48-year-old athlete suffered congestive heart failure and had four surgeries over the course of nine hours.

His two sons, Anthony Jr and Antoine, are currently at his bedside at the hospital. Mason's mother, Mary, will celebrate her 90th birthday tomorrow.

Mason's old team sent out this tweet Wednesday as news of his health crisis began circulating online 

According to Vecsey, the 6-foot-7, 350lbs Mason has been struggling with heart problems recently.

On Wednesday, he was at a hospital undergoing tests when he suffered a heart attack.

While the Knicks would not directly address Mason's health crisis, the team sent out a tweet that read: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Anthony Mason and his family.'

Mason played for six different teams between 1989 and 2003, including five memorable seasons with the Knicks in the mid-90s.

In 1994, he helped the New York team reach the NBA Finals. A year later, Mason was named the league's Sixth Man of the Year, and in 2001 he became an All-Star with the Miami Heat.

Known for his aggressive, physical style on the court, Mason gave himself the nickname 'Locksmith', saying, ‘Put me on anybody, and I’ll lock them up,' according to the New York Post.
