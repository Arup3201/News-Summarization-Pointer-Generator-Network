Plans to make one of Heathrow Airport's runways more than four miles long in a move campaigners say will cut night-time noise over London have gone on show to the public.

The so-called 'Heathrow Hub' plans will see the northern runway at the west London terminal doubled in size and divided into two - with a 650-metre 'safety zone' in the middle - allowing planes to use either end at the same time.

The proposal - which would see the M25 diverted into a tunnel beneath the super-sized landing strip - is an alternative to plans to build entirely new runways either at Heathrow or Gatwick Airports.

Organisers of the third option - which  say it could be finished by 2023 - have shown  off their plans in an advert taken out in national newspapers over the past week.

The idea has been put forward as an alternative to building entirely new runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick to boost airport capacity

The artists' impressions of the plan show the runway extending way out to the west of the airport, north of a proposed terminal six, which would be built next to the current terminal five.

Those behind the campaign say it would cut the noise of flights over London by shifting early morning flights to the new section of tarmac, meaning planes land and take off two and half miles further away from the capital.

They claim the scheme would bring in the economic benefits of further airport expansion at a lower cost, requiring less land and with reduced disruption.

Former Concorde pilot Jock Lowe, the leader of the Heathrow Hub concept, said: 'Our proposal would cost billions of pounds less than Heathrow Airport's plan to build a third runway and the latest Airports Commission report said it expects our expansion plan to boost the UK economy by up to £214bn and to create as many as 163,000 new jobs nationwide – double the benefits offered by expanding Gatwick.'

As well as the huge runway, the scheme  also includes plans for better rail access to the site.

Campaigners behind the plan say early morning flights could be shifted two miles west, meaning planes fly 800ft higher, thus reducing noise for west London residents living underneath the flight-path

The plans were unveiled to the public after the Government's airports 'tsar' Sir Howard Davies, whose commission is evaluating the three schemes, warned all of them would cost more than they claim.

His commission calculated that an entirely new runway to the north-west of Heathrow would cost around £18.6billion as opposed to Heathrow Airport Ltd's estimate of £14.8billion.

A new runway at Gatwick, estimated by Gatwick Airport Ltd to cost £7.4billion, would cost an estimated £9.3billion.

The third shortlisted option - an extension of the existing northern runway at Heathrow - would cost £13.5billion - higher than the £10.1billion estimated by Heathrow Hub.

Davies will deliver his final report on which scheme should go ahead in summer 2015.

Organisers say early-morning flights will be told to land on the western end of the new runway, cutting noise to nearby homes in west London

As well as plans for extending the runway, the 'Heathrow Hub' campaign wants to connect the airport to HS2 rail link planned for the UK

The plan is being put forward by a consortium including former Concorde pilot Jock Lowe, who says it would be cheaper than other plans
