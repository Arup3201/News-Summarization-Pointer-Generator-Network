Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes Liverpool remain title contenders despite the departure of last season’s top goalscorer Luis Suarez to Barcelona. 

The Reds narrowly missed out on winning the league last season to Manchester City by two points, with Suarez contributing 31 goals as Brendan Rodgers' side played a swashbuckling brand of football.

In it to win it: Steven Gerrard believes Liverpool can still challenge for the title despite selling Luis Suarez

Deadly: Suarez (right) scored 31 Premier League goals last season as Liverpool finished second

Suarez's goalscoring exploits saw him earn a £75million to the Nou Camp in July, but Gerrard says Liverpool will still challenge for the league even without the mercurial forward.

The former England captain cites the sale of Fernando Torres to Chelsea in 2011 as an example of how the Anfield outfit moved on when they lost another key player.

Gerrard said: ‘I can understand what people are thinking, because he is such a good player. I am his No 1 fan and no doubt there is a hole that will be left when someone like that leaves.

‘But it was exactly the same when Fernando Torres moved on. This club is so big that it moves forward, it’s not about one player.

‘We have been really sharp in the transfer market to soften the blow of a world-class player going. Now everyone needs to share the responsibility of Luis moving on and that starts with me.

‘Last year we were in it until the end and that has given us the belief we are genuine contenders.’

Moving on: Gerrard says Liverpool will get over losing Suarez just like when Fernando Torres joined Chelsea
