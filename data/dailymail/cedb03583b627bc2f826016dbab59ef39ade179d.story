Manchester City have drawn Bayern Munich in the Champions League group stages for the third time in four seasons. City, who have never won the competition before, will also face CSKA Moscow and AS Roma in Group E.

City faced Bayern Munich in the group stages last season, where they lost 3-1 at the Etihad, before travelling to Munich and winning 2-3.

Two seasons previously, in 11/12, City faced Bayern again, where both sides won their home fixture 2-0. 

Group E: Manchester City in training this week

Bayern Munich

Manchester City's Head-to-head: P 4 W 2 L 2 D 0

Star man: Arjen Robben

Manager: Pep Guardiola

Stadium: Allianz Arena

European pedigree: The 2013 European Champions are formidable opponents. 

Five-time European Champions and with a spine of players who helped Germany win the World Cup, Bayern Munich are, alongside Real Madrid and Barcelona, one of the best three sides in Europe.

Did you know: This is the third time in four seasons that City have drawn Bayern Munich in the Champions League group stage.

CSKA Moscow

Manchester City's Head-to-head: P 2 W 2 L 0 D 0

Star man: Alan Dzagoev

Manager: Leonid Slutsky

Stadium: Arena Khimki

European pedigree: Despite being seeded third, in this group CSKA are undoubtedly the minnows. 

This is the first time since 2008 that they are playing Champions League football for the second consecutive season, and they have never been past the quarter-finals. 

Moscow is not an easy trip, but they may well struggle.

Did you know: CSKA met Manchester City in last season's group stage, with City winning both games and scoring seven times in the process.

Roma

Manchester City's Head-to-head: P 0 W 0 L 0 D 0

Star man: Miralem Pjanic

Manager: Rudi Garcia

Stadium: Stadio Olimpico

European pedigree: Roma have reached the Champions League quarter-finals twice in the last decade, and their squad is as good as it has been in years. 

A brilliant start to last season faded somewhat, but they still finished second in Serie A and are no pushovers.

Did you know: Manchester City have never faced Roma, but the Italian side did suffer their worst ever European defeat in Manchester when they lost to United 7-1 in 2007.
