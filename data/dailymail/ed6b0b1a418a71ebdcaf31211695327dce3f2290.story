Part-time DJ: A picture of Brad Houston from the
Facebook page he uses to promote his music work. He had a fling with drugs mule
Michaella McCollum

Drugs mule Michaella McCollum is not a drug dealer and her party girl public image is not a true reflection of her character, her former lover has claimed.

Part-time DJ Brad Houston enjoyed a five-day fling with the Northern Ireland woman in Ibiza shortly before she was arrested trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of Peru.

'She's a 20-year-old girl, like anyone's normal daughter. She's not a drug dealer,' he said.

The web developer from Salisbury also 
said he believed McCollum was innocent because she had no cover story to
account for her week-long disappearance, which sparked a global 
internet appeal.

'If she was going to do a big 
£1.5million drug deal or be a mule, the last thing she would do would 
(be to) get an international search for a missing person while she was 
doing that,' he said.

'She would have set her Facebook 
status or contacted her parents. She would have had a cover story. But, 
out of nowhere she just disappeared.'

McCollum, 20, from Dungannon, Co 
Tyrone, and co-accused Melissa Reid, 20, from Glasgow, last week pleaded
guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge.

They had hoped the behind-closed-doors
admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence but prosecutors 
have demanded more information before accepting their admissions of 
guilt.

Speaking on a prime-time chat show 
aired by Irish national broadcaster RTE, Mr Houston said he never saw 
McCollum take drugs in Ibiza and he did not believe she was involved 
with criminal gangs.

'If I thought she was involved with 
dangerous people I do not think I would have spent any time with her,' 
he said. 'I have a career and I have a son as well so I wouldn't want 
anything that could get me in trouble.'

He also dismissed claims McCollum may 
have been in financial difficulty because she had saved enough money to 
pay for accommodation for the whole season.

'She really did pride herself on being a strong Irish independent woman,' he added.

Although their affair was brief, Mr Houston claimed to have a made a 'real connection' with the former nightclub hostess.

Photographs of the loved up pair drinking champagne on a boat were posted on his Facebook page.

He said: 'I was there for a week and we spent five days together and I really did fob off my mates to spend time with her.

'We got on the sauce and drunk quite a lot; went to a few clubs and done some really good stuff together. We had some really deep conversations so we really did connect well out there.'

McCollum and Reid initially claimed 
they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to board a flight from 
Lima to Spain with 24lbs of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their 
luggage when they were arrested.

They
have been detained by the authorities in Peru since last month and were
transferred to the Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima after their recent 
court appearance.

Prison hell: Mr Houston said that during his five-day fling with McCollum in Ibiza they 'got on the sauce and drunk quite a bit' he never saw her take drugs and he did not believe she was involved with criminal gangs

Both women had been working on the Spanish party island of Ibiza this summer although Mr Houston said he never heard his former lover speak about a friend called Melissa.

'The name Melissa never came up,' he told the Saturday Night Show.

Mr Houston said he had not previously spoken out because he was in shock but now felt compelled to try and change the public perception of his ex.

'I can't really change what's happening with the court case over in Peru but, perhaps I can change the public's view on Michaella because there has not been a lot of support,' he said.
