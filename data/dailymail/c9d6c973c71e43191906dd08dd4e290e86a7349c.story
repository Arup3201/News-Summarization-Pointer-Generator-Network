Italian Paolo Di Canio has criticised the inability of English footballers to adjust the pace of their game to suit the hot conditions expected at the World Cup.

'As a coach, it happened to me several times,' said the former Sunderland and Swindon manager.

'I would ask for a lower tempo to respond to certain technical and tactical details, but I couldn’t do anything, they all continue the same.

'Historically, a weak point is that the English concede absurd goals, incredible. I have looked over some of the examples of their goalkeepers, and they have made some incredible mistakes.'

Italy, England’s first opponents in Brazil, have not won since September but Di Canio, who did not win an international cap, believes they are better equipped than Roy Hodgson’s team to cope with the heat and humidity of Manaus, in the Amazon rainforest.

'I’ve noticed some difficulties for Italy but the Italian players have the value of flexibility, they can change position,' he said.

'They may lack a true identity, but at a physical level our work from the past two weeks will be better than that of the English, who are exhausted.

'England are missing parts, the reserves are not up to scratch. The players are tired - I really like Wayne Rooney but he arrives in these competitions cooked, because he plays a lot of games in the season.

'He gives all of himself in every game and the Brazilian temperatures will be very hard for him. In England they do not have a winter break and it is great to play at Christmas, but they then pay for this in June. In this period, fatigue can be devastating.

'England have freshness, youth, but it will be difficult for them to go through. They are unable to manage themselves. They always put in the maximum and always have to give 200 per cent.'

Di Canio picked out Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Ross Barkley as 'interesting talents' in the England squad and hailed teenager Luke Shaw was 'one of the best full-backs in Europe'.

But he added: 'The English have a problem. They play little together. They do not attack the space and must have a better understanding.'
