Sunderland's wait for a win will extend into October for a second season in a row, but their former loanee Ki Sung-yeung believes players and supporters should keep faith in Gus Poyet. 

Swansea midfielder Ki enjoyed a successful loan spell under the Uruguayan last season.

‘Sunderland fans need to be patient because it will all be worth it in the end,’ he said.

Sunderland and Swansea have gone more than six hours between them without a league goal

‘When Gus came in he tried to build a team with a passing game. Last year sometimes it worked and sometimes not.

‘The players have to keep listening to what Gus has to say. Don’t forget Swansea have had this style a long time now and it doesn’t happen straight away. It takes time to get it right.’

The home side rallied in the wake of Angel Rangel’s 80th-minute dismissal for two bookable offences but the closest they came was a pair of wayward headers from misfiring frontmen Connor Wickham and Steven Fletcher, both still without a league goal this season. But Swedish midfielder Seb Larsson is refusing to panic.

But midfielder Sebastian Larsson insists now is not the time to panic 

‘I’m not worried yet,’ he said. ‘It depends on how you choose to look at it. You could say we have not won a game, but on the other hand we have lost just one.

‘I believe if we keep performing like that we will pick up enough points.’

Swansea boss Garry Monk argued that the length of the grass affected his side’s passing game.

‘It was not as conducive to playing flowing football as we are used to,’ he said.

‘I am not saying that is the reason we didn’t play well but it obviously contributed.’ 

Garry Monk was satisfied with a point at the Stadium of Light after his team was reduced to 10 men
