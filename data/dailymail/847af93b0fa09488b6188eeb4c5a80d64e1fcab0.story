Bill Cosby has refused to address the scores of rape allegations that have been hurled at him in recent months, but that doesn't mean he isn't working to clear his name. 

The comedian is allegedly paying private investigators six-figure fees to dig up dirt on the more than two dozen women who have come forward to accuse him of rape, according to a report in the New York Post.

A source told the paper that Cosby has hired a Glendale, California, firm to discredit his many alleged victims' stories.

Hitting back: Bill Cosby has allegedly hired a team of private investigators to dig up dirt on the many women accusing him of rape 

Cosby allegedly spoke with his legal and public relations teams about the sex scandal, and his response to it, at a recent meeting.

'If you’re going to say to the world that I did this to you, then the world needs to know, ‘What kind of person are you? Who is this person that’s saying it?’ ' Cosby said, according to an anonymous source who was present at the meeting. 

'You can’t say that I put something in your coffee, threw you in a cab and then you go on and live a high-profile life, a famous life and you never complain. You mean you never reported it to the police? You never tell anyone?' Cosby continued, referring to one of his accusers, Beverly Johnson.

Johnson claimed that Cosby raped her after slipping a drug into her cappuccino during a visit to his home in the 1980s.

Another source who says they have worked with Cosby for at least a decade confirmed the tactic and said it has already been successful in finding information to discredit both Johnson and another alleged victim, Katherine McKee.

The team discovered that Johnson's live-in boyfriend at the time only heard her say nice things about Cosby and that McKee, an ex-girlfriend of Sammy Davis Jr, wrote posts praising the comedian online after the alleged rape, according to the Post. 

In a published interview, McKee also once said she is 'used to lying'.

McKee, now 65, is the latest woman to publicly come forward to accuse Cosby, saying the comedian raped her in a Michigan hotel room in the early 1970s after inviting her to a party on a boat in Detroit. 

The former actress, who appeared on Sanford and Son and even The Bill Cosby Show, never spoke of the incident in public before last week.   

'It was a rape, but it seemed so strange to call it that. We think of rape as a stranger who attacks you in a parking lot,' McKee, now a casting agent, told the New York Daily News. 'I chalked it up to another powerful person in Hollywood who just felt he could take what he wanted from women.' 

Cosby's attorney Martin Singer would not confirm whether the comedian had hired any private detectives.
