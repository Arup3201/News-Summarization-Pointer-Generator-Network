Forget Chanel handbags and green juices, all you need to gain a loyal following on Instagram is a chihuahua and a pair of scissors.

Collage artist Klee Van Schoonhoven, 37, spends her spare time photographing her tiny pooch Goldie in amusing positions using pages cut out from fashion magazines.

The cleverly created project sees the ten-year-old pooch pose alongside famous style icons including Kate Moss and Pharrell Williams.

One photograph even sees the stylish pup take on the role of the infamous US Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

Klee, who lives in New York, says she originally started the project, which she shares on Instagram, with a children's book in mind, but Goldie's expressions and attitude leaned more towards subtle adult humour.

'I have always loved and collected images from fashion magazines,' said the creative student. 

Klee doesn't use computer trickery to create her images and simply relies on her dog's patient to get the perfect picture - seen here posing with Pharrell Williams

Klee loves reading the positive comments that Goldie receives online and says its great to turn photos that often make women feel bad about themselves, into something humorous 

'I found the juxtaposition of a chihuahua and high-end fashion highly amusing and thought others would too - that's when I began the Instagram feed.'

Klee captures Goldie using just her iPhone and never manipulates her images with software.

She said: 'I have a set at home where we shoot everything. I create most of the props using magazine clippings that I cut into shape and mount.'

Klee says that Goldie can be a real diva on set and will bark when she is ready to have her photograph taken

Goldie's amusing poses have earned her almost 5000 followers on Instagram

Goldie proves to be a real diva on set and gives her owner anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute to get the shot before becoming distracted and trotting off.

Klee says that when it comes to photographing her pooch she always adheres to her demands. 

'Sometimes she will randomly hop onto set and bark to let me know she is ready to shoot.

'I just prepare the props and follow her lead - don't let her fool you, she's the boss.' 

Klee takes her professional looking shots using nothing more than her iPhone camera 

Goldie only gives Klee 30 seconds to a minute of her attention before she chooses to walk off set

Klee says that she was thrilled with the response and was happy that Goldie has picked up a lot of fans in the internet with the dog having almost 5,000 followers on Instagram.

'I love reading comments which say seeing a picture of Goldie being her naturally ridiculous self has brightened their day.

'If Goldie's head breaking through pictures of perfection that might normally make someone feel bad about themselves makes them smile - then that makes me happy.' 

Klee creates her props by cutting images out of fashion magazines and mounting them
