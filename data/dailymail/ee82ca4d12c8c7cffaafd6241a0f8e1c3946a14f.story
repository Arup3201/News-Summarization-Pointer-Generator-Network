Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon has died following a long and difficult battle with colon cancer.

The 59-year-old had initially been diagnosed with the terminal illness in 2012 when he was given just three months to live.

A big animal rights advocate, Simon had previously announced that he would donate his $100 million fortune to his charity once he passed. He died at home in L.A. on Sunday surrounded by his family and his beloved dog.

'For those of us who knew him, his voice will forever echo in our minds; his sense of humor will continue to make us laugh; and his compassion and generosity will continue to impact our lives,' The Sam Simon Foundation said in a statement issued to TMZ.

'Sam, you will be missed by many, but there is a particular sadness among our clinic staff. We have been together for so long, and your absence will forever leave a void in our lives.'

'A great man; I owe him everything,' tweeted The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, adding that his passing was 'an enormous loss.'

Simon was last interviewed in November when he described his illness as the 'most amazing experience of my life', because he was surrounded by his loved ones.

After his diagnosis in 2012, Simon immediately teamed up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation.

Having defied that diagnosis' original death sentence, Simon then pushed ahead and has funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities. 

'They showed me my scans', said Simon to NBC's Maria Shriver Project during last November's interview.

Philanthropy: Simon had decided to donate his estimated $100 million fortune to charity

'They said these are the scans of a dead man. I said, 'Is it curable?' And they said, 'We don't use that word.'

'I will say that the doctor said, 'I can't cure you, but my job is to keep you alive.' And he has done a remarkable job of it.

'He has done great. I have never been happier, so thank you doctor.'

However, Simon did not shrink from the realities of his condition, nor fail to inject some trademark humor.

'Cancer is a horrible disease,' he said.

'Its everything that everybody always tells you. It's a journey, it's a fight. But, if you want publicity and you want to pick up girls, then cancer is the greatest thing in the world.'

Simon had no children and wasn't married so had decided to give his millions to causes he cared passionately about. 

He had been married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s. They divorced in 1991 and remained close up until Simon's passing.

Having already lived longer than doctors initially gave him, Simon told Maria Shriver that amazingly, his happiness was a direct result of his cancer diagnosis.

'Somehow I ended up surrounded by people who love me and take care of me and will do anything for me. That is called happiness. I think I may have had a problem letting it in before.

'Cancer has been a fight, a journey, an adventure and the most amazing experience of my life.'

Simon spent his final months funding projects that feed homeless people and saved animals from being killed in animal shelters. 

Simon created the hit cartoon alongside Matt Groening in 1991. He technically retired from The Simpsons in 1993, but his severance package earned him about $10 million a year.

Asked why he decided to dedicate his fortune and final months to animal rights, Simon was unequivocal.

Sam Simon, who made a fortune as co-creator of The Simpsons, died on Sunday. Before his death the nine-time Emmy-winning writer-producer used his wealth to, among other causes, help shut down roadside zoos and abusive animal shows, fund a dog-rescue haven in Malibu, and fight hunger

'The thing about animals that speaks to me so much is that my passion for the animals and against animal abuse is based on the knowledge that these creatures which think and feel can't speak for themselves,' said Simon to NBC.

'I feel it is my responsibility to speak for those who can't speak for themselves.'

Simon grew up comfortably in Beverly Hills, where his father was in the garment industry, not showbiz.

After turning his drawing talent into a job at an animation studio that made cartoons for kids, Simon submitted a script, on spec, to the ABC comedy Taxi. His script was bought and produced, and Simon, in his 20s, was hired as a staff writer and soon rose to be the showrunner.

From there he joined a new NBC sitcom called Cheers, where he was staff writer for its ascendant first three seasons.

In 1987 he became a writer and executive producer on the Fox comedy series The Tracey Ullman Show, teamed alongside James L. Brooks, the comedy legend with whom he had worked on Cheers and Taxi, and, of course, cartoonist Matt Groening. They became the founding fathers of The Simpsons.

The Simpsons began as interstitial cartoon clips aired during the otherwise live-action Ullman show until, in 1989, it was spun off as a Fox half-hour of its own.

Simon was named creative supervisor, and he hired the first writing staff as well as creating several Springfield citizens, including Mr. Burns, the cadaverous industrialist, and Dr. Hibbert, the buffoonish physician.

Although Simon remained the least-known of the three creators, by many accounts he was the most hands-on.

'You can't overstate his contribution to The Simpsons,' said talk-show star Conan O'Brien, who was a Simpsons writer and producer in the early 1990s. 'No one's smarter than he is.'

The show - TV's first successful prime-time animated series since The Flintstones nearly three decades before - caught the public off-guard with its sly but perceptive look at the culture.

'With The Simpsons people didn't know what they were gonna see,' says Simon. 'They didn't have a clue.'

The show was given time and free reign to flourish by the fledgling Fox network. 'I don't think you get that sort of creative freedom with any broadcast shows today.'

Simon left The Simpsons after its fourth season in 1994 owing to a strained relationship with Groening.

But it was a lucrative departure. His exit deal entitled him to royalties from The Simpsons annually pad Simon tens of millions of dollars.

He played no role on the show in nearly 20 years (not even watching it, he said), even as his name remained in the weekly credits along with Groening's and Brooks' - and his checks rolled in.

This sweet annuity helped bankroll the causes and alternative lifestyle he came to embrace.

Among with his charitable efforts, he established the Sam Simon Foundation, which rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist disabled veterans and the hard-of-hearing. 

In March, 2012, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' Norfolk, Va., headquarters were christened the Sam Simon Center in recognition of his support for that organization.

Simon's largesse also carried over to humans, too, including a Los Angeles food bank that feeds 200 families each day in Simon style: with a vegan menu.
