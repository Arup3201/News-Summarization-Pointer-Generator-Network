A rare phaser gun prop from the original series of Star Trek is tipped to make $60,000 when it goes under the hammer - 50 years after it first appeared on TV screens.

Star Trek is now considered one of the greatest television programmes ever made and original props demand a high price among its legions of dedicated fans around the world.

Sci-fi history: This fibreglass phaser prop from the original series of sci-fi serial Star Trek is expected to make as much as $60,000 when it goes under the hammer at a specialist prop auction in Los Angeles next month

Experts say the phaser appears in an episode called Assignment: Earth, broadcast on March 29, 1968. They even traced the scene it was used in by matching up scratches and blemishes on the prop.

They found it was being held by a security officer in Enterprise's transporter room in the opening sequence of the episode.

Assignment: Earth, which followed the crew of the Enterprise on a journey back to Earth for research purposes was the 55th in the original series of Star Trek.

The prop has been described as 'an incredible piece of television history' and is tipped to fetch $60,000 when it is auctioned at Propworx near Los Angeles.

It belonged to the production company behind Star Trek, Desilu, and was sold off after filming ended in 1969. It has been owned privately ever since.

Some wear and tear: Nut the prop has been described as 'an incredible piece of television history' and is tipped to fetch $60,000 when it is auctioned at Propworx near Los Angeles on February 21

A spokesman for Propwox said: 'This is an exceptionally rare screen-used fiberglass phaser pistol from Star Trek: The Original Series, and one of only two such examples that is known to have survived from the 60s.

'This incredible piece of television history has been exhaustively researched and precisely screen matched to the mid-grade phaser prop featured in an opening scene in the episode Assignment: Earth where it is seen in a close-up view on-screen in the hand of a security officer in the transporter room.

'It is the presence of both a uniquely contoured scratch line and a small blemish formed by excess paint - both on the front face of the pistol body - as well as perfectly matching orientations of the attached silver nozzle ring and the right-angled metal plate on top that have enabled this particular prop to be positively identified on-screen in that memorable time-travel episode, which originally was broadcast on March 29, 1968.

'Furthermore, it is extremely likely that this historic hand prop, as part of the Desilu inventory, was utilised in the filming of several other episodes during the second and third seasons of the original series in addition to Assignment: Earth.

'While this hand prop features some paint wear, surface scratches and some seam separation and missing knobs and accent pieces that is typical of rare screen used TOS memorabilia.

'It is undeniably a visually exciting, sturdily-constructed and highly presentable piece of Star Trek history - a truly iconic and highly desirable addition to the finest of Star Trek and Hollywood memorabilia collections.'

The auction will be held on February 21.
