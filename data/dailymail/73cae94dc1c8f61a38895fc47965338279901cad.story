Google's inbox shows live alerts and updates

Google has launched an new email
service it hopes will help people organise their lives.

Called 'Inbox', it mixes traditional email with live alerts for appointments, flight
bookings and package deliveries.

Google said the service was designed to deal with the way email has changed.

'Email started simply as a way to send digital notes around the office,' said Google's Sundar Pichai.

'But fast-forward 30 years and with just the phone in your pocket, you can use email to contact virtually anyone in the world…from your best friend to the owner of that bagel shop you discovered last week.'

The new Inbox will address the rpboem of getting too much email.

'With this evolution comes new challenges: we get more email now than ever, important information is buried inside messages, and our most important tasks can slip through the cracks—especially when we’re working on our phones. 

'For many of us, dealing with email has become a daily chore that distracts from what we really need to do—rather than helping us get those things done.'

For now the new service is being provided alongside Gmail,
which was launched in 2004. 

It will be available on the Web as
well as on Android smartphones and iPhones.

Google said it was sending out invitations to selected Gmailusers to try out the new service.

Users can also email the
company at inbox@google.com to get an invitation.

'Inbox is by the same people who brought you Gmail, but it's
not Gmail: it's a completely different type of inbox, designed
to focus on what really matters,' the company said in a blog
post.

Google said Inbox displays real-time updates to emails - for
example, showing the delivery status of items bought online.

Inbox highlights the key information from important messages, such as flight itineraries, event information, and photos and documents emailed to you by friends and family.

It will even display useful information from the web that wasn’t in the original email, such as the real-time status of your flights and package deliveries.

It lets you add your own Reminders, from picking up the dry cleaning to giving your parents a call and can show the relevant numbers alongside tasks.

It also shows reminders in a more accessible way that allows
users to more easily keep track of chores and appointments.

The company said the new application also enhances features
that are already available in Gmail that allow users to view
purchases and bank account statements grouped together.

Google's shares were up 1.7 percent at $547.33 in early
afternoon trading Nasdaq.
