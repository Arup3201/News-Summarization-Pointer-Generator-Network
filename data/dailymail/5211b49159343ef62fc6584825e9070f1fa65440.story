A jet black Rolls Royce Silver Shadow which belonged to legendary country singer Johnny Cash is going up for auction this week.

The plush British-built vehicle was gifted to Cash in 1970 by television network ABC when he was at the height of his fame.

At the time, Cash - nicknamed the Man in Black because of his trademark black stage outfit - was the star of the network thanks to his successful weekly music variety show The Johnny Cash Show.

However, it's not clear how much the vehicle will go for with the auctioneers refusing to name an estimate price and no reserve placed on it.

The sleek Rolls Royce Silver Shadow was originally ordered as a gift for singer Johnny Cash

It was used to chauffeur Cash around in the 1970s, but was then sold into private hands the following decade

The TV network's order specifications included it being left hand drive with a privacy partition between the front and back seats, and having Cash's initials emblazoned on to the rear doors

The luxury classic also boasts a twin-carburettor V8 engine and independent front and rear suspension

The programme featured the great and good of rock and roll and country music including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor.

Cash, then 38, opened each show with a performance and the programme often included songs from his wife June Carter Cash and the Carter Family singers.

The show was a hit with viewers, and in recognition ABC forked out $9,500 - around $60,000 or £37,000 in today's money - to have the Roller custom made in Cash's trademark black throughout.

They even had his initials JRC embedded into the doors in gold.

Cash sold the 1970 long wheelbase Silver Shadow in the mid 1980s and it has since passed through the hands of several private collectors.

The luxury classic boasts a twin-carburettor V8 engine, three-speed automatic transmission, independent front and rear suspension and four-wheel disc brakes.

The auction house is refusing to place an estimate value on the car and say it is being sold without a reserve

It is going under the hammer with 32,000 miles on the clock at an auction in Las Vegas held by classic car specialists Barrett Jackson.

Experts say the historic motor will be auctioned with no reserve - but they are remaining tight-lipped about how much they expect it to sell for.

Craig Jackson, chairman of Barrett Jackson, said: 'In the early 1970s Johnny Cash was pulling in phenomenal ratings with his TV show. It ran for 58 episodes and had some of the biggest stars of the time on it.

'It was one of the biggest shows on TV at the time and as a reward ABC gave Johnny this Rolls Royce Silver Shadow - a black Rolls for the 'Man In Black'.

'They paid $9,500 dollars, a substantial amount of money, to have it custom-made in England and shipped out to the USA. To make it even more special they had his initials painted in gold on the rear doors.

'Johnny used it until the mid 1980s when he sold it to a private collector.

'Johnny Cash was a huge star and with this car you're not just buying a piece of rock and roll memorabilia, you're buying something that he actually used.

'There has been a lot of interest in this car. It is in mint condition and it could well be bought by a museum or a fan.

'It's selling with no reserve so it will sell regardless of price. We don't put estimates on cars - we will find out what its real value is on the auction day.'
