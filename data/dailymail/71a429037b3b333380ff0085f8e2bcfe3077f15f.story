A retired GP told last night how his wife died in a swollen waterfall as he tried desperately to save her.

Malcolm Jones was walking with Sue, 60, at a beauty spot near their home in the Lake District when she slipped and fell in.

He followed her into the water but the torrent prevented him from reaching her and she was washed down a series of fast-flowing falls and out of his sight.

Tragic: Sue and Malcolm Jones, of Satterthwaite, Cumbria, above, were out walking at Force Forge when the mother-of-two slipped into a powerful waterfall and fell to her death

Mother-of-two Sue, 60, was a popular member of the community in Satterthwaite, Cumbria. Several people have sent cards and flowers to Dr Jones and the village church is flying its flag at half mast out of respect

‘At one point I could see her but I 
could not get to her because she was trapped between rocks,’ he said. 
‘When I finally got to her I knew it was too late.

‘I managed to drag her on to the bank and then I crawled up on to the main road for help. It was freezing cold.’

Police
 said a passer-by raised the alarm at 10.45am on Saturday and fire and 
ambulance crews were at the scene at Force Beck, Force Forge, near 
Coniston, by 11am.

The 
mother of two was flown by air ambulance to the Royal Lancaster 
Infirmary, where she was later pronounced dead. Police are not treating 
the incident as suspicious.

Dr Jones, 61, and his wife of 36 years moved
 to the old vicarage in the village of Satterthwaite, Cumbria, close to 
the scene of the tragedy, two years ago after enjoying many holidays in 
the area for more than a decade.

They previously owned a holiday cottage in Satterthwaite and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire.

Since
 making the permanent move north, they had spent their time renovating 
their new home. Dr Jones said: ‘We have always travelled to the Lakes 
and we knew that we would eventually want to move here.

‘This
 was the house my wife had always had her eye on and so when it came on 
the market we decided to take the opportunity to move here. It is a 
beautiful place to live, and Sue loved everything about it.’

The
 couple’s daughter Emma, 29, and her partner Simon Cole, took over the 
village’s Eagles Head pub in November, with all the family becoming 
popular members of the community.

A devoted housewife and enthusiastic cook, Mrs Jones also helped out in the pub.

Dr
 Jones said: ‘Sue loved developing the friendships she had made with the
 villagers. We felt very settled here, the community is very small and 
everyone welcomed us.

‘She 
was just so excited to be helping in the pub – she had so much fun 
helping out. It gave us both a new lease of life really.’

The
 couple’s son, paediatric doctor Andrew Jones, 32, who lives in South 
London with his wife Sonya, 31, said his mother ‘was very content and 
happy with what life had to offer right now’.

He
 said: ‘Emma and my mum were extremely close, and so when Emma and Simon
 decided to buy the pub it was the best thing that could have happened.

‘She was thrilled to be helping out, everything was really busy and thriving for them.’

He
 added: ‘She was a very soft, loving person who was elegant and 
beautiful inside and out. It is down to mum that we are such a close 
family, and so it is her legacy that we do her proud and stick together 
at this horrible time. We have lost such a special person.’

The village community has been left devastated by the tragedy. The Rev John Dixon said: 'The church and the village are very shocked by what has happened'

Daughter
 Emma said: ‘Her priority was her family and her friends. She did 
everything for everybody and could never do enough for us. She was the 
most amazing host and loved having us all together as a family.’

Villagers
 are devastated by the tragedy. The Reverend John Dixon said: ‘The 
church and the village are very shocked by what has happened.’

The
 coroner for south and east Cumbria Ian Smith has been informed of Mrs 
Jones’s death. Her funeral is due to take  place at Satterthwaite Church
 next week.
