Cambridge professors will set tough new maths A-levels after the university became the first in Britain to intervene in the exam system, amid concerns about the quality of the country's qualifications.

Its mathematicians will script new syllabuses and exam questions as part of the Government's reforms to drive up education standards, it was reported today.

Cambridge's department of pure mathematics is said to have submitted a report to the Department for Education outlining how new-style maths A-levels should be structured.

Changes: Cambridge's department of pure mathematics is said to have submitted a report to the Department for Education outlining how new-style maths A-levels should be structured

Cambridge wants changes to be made because most talented students who it recruits don’t have sufficient basic maths skills to help them ‘confidently engage anything other than routine problems’.

‘Existing A-level curriculums treat topics superficially and the UK has lost the tradition of teaching school mathematics coherently and in depth,’ the report said. ‘The effect on Cambridge is acute.’

The document by department head Professor Martin Hyland suggests that A-levels should be focused around a series of ‘key mathematical ideas’, reported the Daily Telegraph.

This is expected to include combinatorics, trigonometry, complex numbers, centres of mass and probability. In addition it recommends ‘graded sets of problems’ should be set for bright teenagers.

Most of the assessments will be focused towards all students, but the university is also suggesting the creation of a ‘range of demanding questions to challenge the most able’.

Cambridge University report

The Government announced earlier this year that it intends to give universities, particularly the most elite institutions, a ‘far greater role’ in designing A-levels in the future.

It comes amid concerns that the qualifications are failing to prepare teenagers for degree study. But a leading higher education group has said it is against the plan.

Universities UK said it does not believe it would be ‘advisable or feasible’ for the sector to ‘take ownership’ of the qualifications.
