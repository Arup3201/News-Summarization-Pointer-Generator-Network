TV presenter Phillip Schofield has become the latest celebrity to lose weight using the 5:2 diet.

The This Morning co-host, 51, told audience members at a recent filming of Mrs & Mrs that he had already lost 9lbs on The Fast Diet.

The new diet sees followers fasting for two days a week, reducing their calorie intake to 600 for a man or 500 for a woman.

Speaking in between filming for the ITV game show, Phillip told the crowd: 'I am on the new 5:2 diet. I’ve been doing it for about three weeks and am really hungry.'

He admitted he had already shed half a stone and he has since lost a further two pounds.

Phillip is the latest in a string of stars who follow the diet, which was created by medical journalist Dr Michael Mosley and appeared on a BBC2 Horizon documentary Eat, Fast & Live Longer last year.

Michael teamed up with journalist Mimi 
Spencer to co-write The Fast Diet book, which has sold over 340,000 
copies and has been reprinted 13 times.

It has been at the top of the Amazon UK book charts over the past few weeks and recently hit the top 10 in the health and fitness book bestsellers on the US site.

Explaining the diet, Mimi recently wrote in You magazine: 'A food-free window twice a week helps the body repair itself. Get that body back on the scales after a few weeks and it should weigh a bit less.'

Food writer Hugh-Fearnley-Whittingstall admitted in January he had lost 8lbs on the diet.

He said at the time: 'I’ve lost eight pounds already, and I find the whole thing rather exhilarating. I feel I might just be part of a health revolution.

'But is it really sustainable, for me or for significant numbers of others? Can I honestly say I’m backing myself to be fasting regularly a year from now? I very much want the answer to be yes.'

Australian model Miranda Kerr, Beyonce, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck and Christy Turlington are also rumoured to have tried the diet.

The 5:2 diet tells followers to eat normally for five days a week – up to 2,000 calories a day for woman and 2,500 for men.

However, for the remaining two, women limit their food intake to 500 calories a day and men 600.

Supporters claim the regime is easier
to stick to than a traditional diet, and research has found links 
between fasting and the body’s ability to repair itself.

However, critics question whether extreme calorie restriction is healthy and warn that fasting can be addictive.

MailOnline has contacted Phillip's representative for comment.
