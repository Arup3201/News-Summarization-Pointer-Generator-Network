Mario Balotelli has made it clear he wants to join Arsenal.

The striker is furious he has been blamed for Italy getting knocked out of the World Cup.

He was always set to leave AC Milan this summer but he is now convinced, not least because he feels he is a target for ‘ultras’ racists and despite problems he encountered in the Premier League while at Manchester City, he recognises that England is more cosmopolitan – especially London.

On the move? Mario Balotelli wants to join Arsenal after a disappointing World Cup with Italy

Home: Balotelli is back in Italy after a disastrous World Cup in Brazil with his national team 

Balotelli wants to force a deal through with Arsenal next week because he is worried the Gunners have other striker targets in mind, such as Real Madrid’s Alvaro Morata.

Southampton, who sold 18-year-old Luke Shaw to Manchester United for £27million plus add-ons, could snap up 16-year-old left back protegee Oscar Borg from West Ham.

Borg is yet to sign as a scholar for the Hammers but would cost the Saints around £220,000 under academy compensation rules.

Real Madrid have pulled out of the race – first revealed in the Football Grapevine – to outbid Barcelona for Luis Suarez.

Instead, Real are poised to sign Colombian Radamel Falcao – who has missed the Word Cup through injury – from Monaco in a £60million deal.

That could see Madrid drive down Suarez’s fee significantly.

Uruguayan Edinson Cavani, currently of Paris St Germain, will come back on the radar of Manchester United if Wayne Rooney does not agree to how Louis van Gaal wants to utilise him.

It is understood Van Gaal is set to play hard-ball with Rooney as a statement of intent of who is charge at Old Trafford.

Fernando Torres wants to stay at Chelsea and Frank Lampard may even offer to play for the club rather than go ‘on loan’ to QPR ahead of playing for New York City in the MSL.

Tottenham believe they will sign Swansea left-back Ben Davies when the transfer window opens on July 1.

iSay

This week there is really only one thing to say.

Despite some terrific games, goals and excitement, professional football no longer feels Jogo Bonito – the beautiful game.

Allegations of FIFA corruption, bungs for betting syndicates and a player assaulting a fellow professional for no reason.

There is an old newspaper saying: Dog bites man, no story. Man bites dog, big story.

But, far from losing his livelihood or even liberty, Suarez arrived back in Uruguay following his ban after an unprovoked assault on Italian Giorgio Cheillini hailed as a national hero.

Banned: Luis Suarez was handed a four-month suspension for biting Giorgio Chiellini

Indeed, he can look forward to a pay rise if a move to Barcelona goes through.

Sometimes justice and morality around modern football seems to be upside-down.

After all his grandmother has been quoted as saying the FIFA ban was ‘barbaric’ and he has been treated like a, er, ‘dog’ as if HE has been the victim of rough, rough justice.

Talk about barking.

Libero

Roy Hodgson clings onto Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, but how can they possibly be the future?

Both of them have been great players. And top blokes, too.

But the fact is that, either as a partnership or in their own right, for all their caps they have not influenced their country as they have done their respective clubs.

Yet, misguidedly, Hodgson thinks Gerrard and Lampard can help bring the Young Lions on.

Yes, having some experience in the middle of the park would help Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and, possibly, Ravel Morrison.

So why not look to West Ham’s Mark Noble and Hull’s Tom Huddlestone? They are both 27 and were both magnificent midfield leaders for their clubs last season.

Back Heel

Luis Suarez has moved into No 1 position for the most outrageous incident on the pitch at a World Cup.

And the previous worst? Well, not his ‘Hand of God’ incident at the last finals, nor Diego Maradona’s in 1986, and not even the Antonio Rattin turn out in 1966.

The spat between Dutchman Frank Rijkaard and German Rudi Voller at the 1990 finals was vile. 

BTW

In a week when football has been in moral maze – some might argue malaise – let’s not forget the positive power of the game.

Tony Adams, Joe Cole, Gary Mabbutt and Nigel Winterburn were among ex-stars who, on Friday night, added their weight to support Refuge Week – a charity connected to Olympic hero Mo Farah.

Stop Press

A Dutch aerospace engineering company, Ruimtevaartbedrijf SXC, have said that if Holland win the whole thing, they will fly the squad and manager Van Gaal into space.

It brings a new dimension to the old cliche about being ‘Over The Moon.’

FOTB

It’s understandable why Liverpool have kept their foot on the ball and not responded to the Suarez situation until they have seen the fine print.

Last time around, the club’s knee-jerk reaction backfired.

What next? Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool must decide what to do about Suarez

VIDEO Suarez family say he should leave Liverpool

But it’s not as if Liverpool are close to taking a moral stance.

They want to maximise a commercial asset.

Condemning Suarez would only result in his transfer fee plummeting even more.

Liverpool wanted £100million but now think they can still get £80m despite all the baggage.

That’s how the business of football has become – even for a club with such strong views on morals.

Y-Factor

Why does the FA think a proper post-mortem into the debacle in Brazil is not required?

Why is Hodgson, who has presided over dire showings at two tournaments, seemingly fire proof?

The answer is, for all the so called modernisation at the FA, the ‘blazers’ in charge want a yes man who ticks the boxes rather than a man who would tear up some trees.

I-bet

Robin Van Persie is 20-1 to score a hat trick against Mexico with Coral.
