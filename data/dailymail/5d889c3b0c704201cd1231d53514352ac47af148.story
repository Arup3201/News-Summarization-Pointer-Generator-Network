An up-scale Indian hotel group is preparing to launch a package  for female tourists designed to ensure their safety while in Delhi in a bid to win back tourists after increased reports of sexual violence against women in the country.

The Leela Hotel Group's New Delhi branch will soon be offering their Kamal (meaning  lotus) program for women who visit the city that starts with complimentary airport transfers with a trusted driver to interaction with female only staff while at the hotel and in public.

The Leela Palace will host Kamal guests on a female only floor, with an all-female staff from the initial check-in, to concierge, butler and housekeeping staff. The hotel will boast security cameras in all public areas, and also implement security screenings.

Private or all-female spa access will also be an option while the hotel will arrange female guides to help tourists around the cities many sights.

The full extent of the program will be launched by Leela on September 15 but it was a matter of time before tourism operators took matters into their hands.

Repeated incidents of violence against women in India has seen many foreigners shun the country, and the most high-profile and prolific offences have taken place in New Delhi.

The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative says one rape occurs every 30 minutes in India, a horrifying statistic that prompted strong words from India's recently elected prime minister Narendra Modi at his first Independence Day address.

Women-only: Exclusively female staff will attend to Kamal guests, from concierge to housekeeping

'When we hear about incidents of rape, our heads hang in shame,' Modi told the nation.

Little has however been done beyond token gestures, and official bodies continue to warn women against travelling alone in India.

The UK Foreign Office tells female tourists, including its own staff, to steer clear of public transport and to avoid taxis or auto-rickshaws after dark. Rather, women should order radio taxis through their hotel when it's more likely the driver as proper qualifications. 

Full package: Kamal will be available across all rooms from the basic to this deluxe Maharaja suit with a pool

'British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa, Delhi, Bangalore and Rajasthan and women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men,' the Foreign Office warns. 

'Serious sexual attacks involving Polish, German and Danish women travellers have been reported so far in 2014. Women travellers should exercise caution when travelling in India even if they are travelling in a group.'
