Earlier this year, jobless mother of 11 Heather Frost caused outrage when it was revealed that she would be moving into a taxpayer-funded £500,000 home with her brood.

But although the resulting furore cost her the house, Frost, who appears in new Channel 5 documentary On Benefits And Proud, is unrepentant.

In the film, the foul-mouthed 37-year-old from Gloucestershire is seen telling her friends that as far as angry taxpayers are concerned, her view is 'f*** the lot of them.'

Outspoken: In the aftermath of the controversy, Frost appeared on Good Morning to defend herself

'It's a f***ing s****y council house,' she adds.
'Everyone wants to believe what they read in the f***ing papers don't 
they.

'Every child needs a house, a roof over their head I should say, 
don't they? It 
wasn't our choice for the council to build a new house, it was theirs.

'No one's put a gun to their f***ing head. I think they [other people] 
are jealous. F*** the lot of them! Everyone's entitled to their opinion 
but everyone's entitled to a place to live.'

Frost, who receives benefits totalling £900 per week - the same as someone who earns £60,000 a year - is now looking forward to a council-funded renovation of her current home, which will see the two three-bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to create a permanent six-bedroom house.

The cost of the renovation will run into thousands of pounds, and includes a new kitchen and bedrooms.

But despite the vast expense to taxpayers, who spend a staggering £100 million on benefits every day according to Government figures, Frost, who has never had a full time job, says the system is put there to help people like her.

'Yes, people don't agree with the 
benefits system and s*** like that but the benefits system is put there 
to help people that can't go out and work,' she asserts.

'Yes, it's my choice and my 
decision to have a large family but there's no law out there to say how 
many kids you can have or can't have. There's people out there with more
kids than me, that's my argument.'

Home: Frost stands in the doorway of her current home which is to be totally remodelled at taxpayer's expense

She adds: 'Fred
West or someone who murdered someone wouldn't have got as much s*** in 
the press as what I got. 

'You only get what you're entitled to. We
have to budget. You know, a weekly shop costs quite a bit, then gas and
electric for both houses - it's all got to come out of it.

'By the end 
of the week, you can guarantee you're skint. We can't afford to take the
kids to Spain or on posh holidays.'

As a result, in order to make ends meet, Frost says she is forced to enlist the help of local shoplifters who sell her purloined goods for half the price of what she would splash out legally in a shop.

'Everybody has to get stuff off shoplifters, don't they,' she says. 'Wouldn't have enough to live otherwise.

Renovation: This three-bedroom home and the one next door will be renovated for the Frost family

Lost: The £500,000 home described by Frost as 'just a s***y council house' that she won't now be moving into

'I'd be lost
without my shoplifters because they bring all my washing powder. They 
do it for half the price of what the shop does.'

When not entertaining shoplifters, Frost says she is looking forward to seeing what kind of response those who do eventually get the £500,000 home she almost moved into.

'Are the people who get it going to get as 
much grief as what I got?' she asks. 'The £500,000 house was built for somebody. So lets
see if they get the s*** I got for being allocated it.'
