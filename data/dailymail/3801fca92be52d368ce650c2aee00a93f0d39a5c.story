Talk about a complete and utter washout. 

This marching band received an unexpected soaking from the pitch irrigation system while providing the pre-match entertainment for Germany's international friendly with Argentina last night.

And things didn't get much better for the band as the evening went on either, as they then had to witness their team lose 2-4 at the Esprit-Arena, in Dusseldorf.

The match itself saw Manchester United new boy Angel di Maria inspire Argentina to a victory over their World Cup final conquerors.

Only four members of the Germany team which started the biggest match in world football on July 13 were selected, and the transformation from the Rio de Janeiro showpiece was dramatic.

Di Maria set up the first three goals for Sergio Aguero, Erik Lamela and Federico Fernandez before adding the fourth in a game filled with chances at both ends.

Argentina led 4-0 early in the second half but Andre Schurrle pulled a goal back for Germany before Fernandez turned a Mario Gotze effort into his own goal, on a night when only players from the English Premier League found the back of the net.

Germany coach Joachim Low was surprisingly unperturbed following his team's performance in the defeat, even managing to find positive things to say about the young and inexperienced team he fielded. 

Yet after a final celebration in Dusseldorf on Wednesday, where the recently retired Philipp Lahm, Miroslav Klose and Per Mertesacker were presented with gifts before an appreciative crowd, Loew said it was time to get back to work and get ready for the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

'It's nice to come together one last time to say farewell to all the players who are not with us anymore,' Low said.

'It wasn't really possible to do that after the World Cup in Berlin. But after tonight's gathering that is going to be the end of the World Cup (celebrations).'
