A paedophile who has been jailed for sexually abusing young boys was close friends with child-killer Roy Whiting and was worshipped by him as a 'God', it has been claimed.

Speedway cycling coach Michael Green, 71, was jailed for nine years on Friday for attacks on two boys in Hampshire in the early 1980s.

Now it has emerged he was a friend, coach and mentor at the time to Whiting, who was jailed in 2001 for abducting and killing eight-year-old Sarah Payne in a crime which shocked the nation.

The link has been revealed by a former mutual friend who released a photo of Green and Whitingn now 55, grinning together at a speedway track.

The friend, who wanted to remain anonymous, fears the pair may have fuelled each others' perversions while close friends at the Crawley Tigers Cycle Speedway Club, West Sussex.

Jailed: Now 71, Michael Green had a mental breakdown after he was convicted

They grew close through a shared love of the sport and were pictured together at an awards ceremony.

'It's one hell of a shock for the sport,' said the source. 'Was Green involved in the sport to do this? He put a lot of money into the sport but was there an ulterior motive?

'He did a lot of good for the sport and attracted a lot of top riders but it is sad, so sad.

'He was a clever guy, but odd. Roy and Mike were very close.

'Some people have asked, "Did one push the other?" You've got two guys with that sort of mentality in one place.

'I think Mike Green was God in Roy Whiting's eyes. If there was a photo they were in it together.'

Green was jailed at Hove Crown Court after a jury convicted him of one count of rape and two indecent assaults.

The victims were both teenagers in the early 1980s and although they are both now physically strong men, they struggled to come to terms with what had happened, the court heard.

Judge Anthony Niblett told Green: 'By your actions you caused [the rape victim] physical pain and emotional harm.

'But, far more significantly, you caused him emotional and psychological trauma from which he has suffered to this day.

'He had no-one to turn to for help at that stage in his life.

'He kept the secret of what you had done to him until well into his adult life.

'His adolescence and early adult life were afflicted by alcohol and drug abuse, used to block out what had happened.

'Only
 in later years, when he remarried, helped and supported by his wife, 
has he been able to unburden himself and begin to come to terms with 
what has happened.'

One of 
Green's victims said after the sentencing: 'The impact that this man has
 had on me and on my life has been like a life sentence.

'Today I can find some closure as justice has been done.'

Defence barrister Jonathan Ray QC said Green, from Hove - who denied the charges - suffered a mental breakdown after being convicted.

But Judge
Niblett described Green as a 'sexual predator', and told him: 'You've been in denial for decades. You've shown no remorse.'

Police have encouraged any further victims of Green to come forward.

Whiting was jailed for life in 2001 when he was convicted of abducting and murdering eight-year-old Sarah Payne in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex.

Her death was the trigger for legislation, widely dubbed 'Sarah's Law', which allows people to ask police if someone who has contact with children is a convicted sex offender.

Since the law came into force in 2011, more than 5,000 applications have been made to police which resulted in parents learning the past of 700 paedophiles.
