They have been billed as Asia's latest unmissable tourist attractions, and these pictures prove they can be seen from miles around.

Man-made 'Supertrees' as tall as skyscrapers are lighting up the night sky over Singapore.

The towering structures, stretching 50 metres into the sky, have giant steel and concrete trunks and thousands of thick wire rods for branches.

Lighting up the sky: The towering structures, made from concrete and steel, are up to 50 metres tall

They form part of the Gardens By The Bay project, a massive £350million development in the city's Marina Bay area.

Fitted with solar panels, hanging gardens and rainwater catches, the trees will be used to display plants from across the globe.

A vast green space is also to be created in the area under plans to make Singapore the 'botanical capital of the world'.

Once completed, the park will house a cluster of green conservatories and will also become home to the Singapore Garden Festival.

Visitors will be able to take in a panoramic view of the gardens via an aerial walkway, dubbed the OCBC Skyway.

The walkway, which links the artificial trees, is suspended 22 metres above the ground - about seven storeys high.

Other grand plans include a dramatic 'light and sound' show, which is due to be held on the site every night from July 2.

City leaders want to create a continuous ring of greenery, with three gardens wrapping around the Marina Bay area.

They want tourists to be able to enjoy the outdoors as well as the city's famous bustling urban centre.

Plans: Once completed, the park will house a cluster of green conservatories and will also become home to the Singapore Garden Festival

Colossal: The imposing trees have concrete trunks weighing hundreds of tonnes, while thousands of thick wire rods have been used to create artificial branches and canopies

Domineering: The island's vast skyscrapers can be seen behind the trees while smaller, real real trees struggle to reach the same immense heights

'The botanical capital of the world': The incredible installation was created as a national landmark as the island looks to create a vast green space in its Marina South district

Horticultural heaven: The entire structure will house a cluster of green
 conservatories when it is completed where, inside, visitors can find 
plants from all over the world

Ambitious project: The Gardens at Marina South is one of three waterfront garden projects under the massive Gardens By The Bay initiative

Upward bound: The towering supertrees will be hard to miss for the thousands of people expected to descend on the recreation area when it opens
