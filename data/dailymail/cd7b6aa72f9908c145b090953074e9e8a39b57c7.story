A Canadian who filmed himself driving a lap around Manhattan in just 24 minutes has been jailed for a year by a New York court in his absence. 

Adam Tang, 31, posted a video of his trip around the island, where he drove at speeds in the region of 100 miles per hour, in August 2013. 

Tang, who posted the video on YouTube under the name AfroDuck Productions, failed to turn up to court for his sentencing hearing.

According to the New York Daily News Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ann Donnelly criticised Tang for not having any respect for the laws of New York state or city. 

She said: 'This is a person who sped around our city as fast as he could, reaching speeds of almost 100 miles per hour at some points and for what? So he could indulge some juvenile fantasy about who could drive the car the fastest around New York City.' 

Prosecutors claimed Tang's credit card details showed he spent two nights in Vermont before crossing the border to Canada. 

Tang, it is alleged, drove around Manhattan in a 255bhp BMW Z4 3.0 convertible at an average speed of 69 miles per hour. On some stretches his car almost hit 100 miles per hour. During the loop, he is forced to stop at six sets of red lights.

The stunt is similar to a 1976 film shot in Paris by Claude Lelouche called Rendezvous. In the movie - which is shot in just one take - Lelouche drives through Paris on an early Sunday morning at break-neck speeds to meet a woman.

However, unlike Lelouche's classic, Tang stops at red lights and never crosses to the wrong-side of the road.

Self proclaimed: Tang flaunted his speeding in a YouTube video that has drawn more than 875,000 views

In Tang's video, he starts recording from the 116th Street on the FDR heading downtown, before using the Henry Hudson Highway and back onto 116th Street in just 24 minutes.

During the summer of 2013, a record was set for the fastest loop around Manhattan starting from 116th St. on the FDR heading downtown, up the Henry Hudson Highway, and back down to 116th St. in just 24 minutes. 

'The city's roadways are not a racetrack,' District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement.

But defense lawyer Gregory Gomez suggested that while Tang might have pushed the envelope on traffic regulations, he didn't commit a crime, reports NBC.

Gomez said Thursday he respected the verdict and would focus now on getting Tang to court, arguing for 'an appropriate sentence' and determining whether to appeal. 

Tang — known to the YouTube world as 'AfroDuck' — was arrested in September 2013, after the video appeared and police traced him through his computer's Internet address.

'I am a car fanatic,' Tang told officers when they arrived, according to a prosecution court filing.

The stock trader said he'd wanted to break unofficial speed records for looping Manhattan, but he insisted he didn't do it recklessly, the document said.

'I put a lot of esteem into driving and being a conscious and aware driver,' he said.

The nighttime footage captured a car zooming along highways and streets that ring Manhattan, weaving around other cars as brake lights flash at its approach, but also stopping for six red lights.

In March, Tang rejected a plea offer that would have entailed two months in jail. His lawyer said then that Tang, married to an American woman, wanted to avoid any criminal record because of possible immigration complications.

Tang was arrested again in April, after police said they found him driving in the Bronx although his license had been suspended because of his earlier arrest. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving, a traffic infraction, and paid a fine, Gomez said then.
