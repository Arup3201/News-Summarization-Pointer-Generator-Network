Next time you develop an embarrassing itch or lump, you might want to reconsider turning to health websites to diagnose your symptoms.

A researcher has discovered that a number of major health websites are 'leaking' web users’ search terms to third-party advertising and marketing companies.

And while there is no evidence that the information obtained is being misused, Professor Marco Huesch said that failure to address concerns about his findings may diminish trust in health-related websites.

The study made clear that there is no evidence that any company is misusing the information that web users 'give' them, but said failure to address concerns may diminish trust in health-related websites and reduce the willingness of people to use them

In theory, he said, the data could make it possible to identify an individual user's health conditions.

Professor Huesch, of the University
 of Southern California-Los Angeles and Duke business school, used freely
 available interception software to monitor 20 leading health websites.

Popular websites used in the research included WebMD, Weight Watchers, Men's Health and NHS UK.

By entering search terms such as 'herpes', 'cancer' or 'depression' into their search engines, he discovered that all 20 sites used at least one method to track its users. Shockingly, on average the sites used six or seven different ways to track their webpage visitors.

A 'tracking element' is a long-acting computer script that reports to a third party - such as an marketing company - about a user's online behaviour on a website.

Professor Heusch also found that 13 of the 20 websites contained one or more tracking elements while five of the 13 sites that had trackers had also enabled social media button tracking.

No tracking elements were found on doctor-oriented sites closely tied to professional groups however.

'A patient who searches on a "free" health-related website for information related to ‘herpes’ should be able to assume that the inquiry is anonymous,' wrote Professor Huesch.

'If not anonymous, the information knowingly or unknowingly disclosed by the patient should not be divulged to others. Unfortunately, neither assumption may be true.'

Huesch worries that the data passed on to third parties could be used in combination with tracking and other information obtained from social media websites to create highly revealing profiles of individual users.

'In theory, someone could build up a very powerful document with all of your medical conditions, the drugs you're taking, where you work, who your relatives are, where you live, and other personal information,' Huesch told The Verge.

He is not entirely against targeted 
advertising however - a common tactic employed by many sites to allow 
advertisers to serve-up ads based on a user's browsing history.

He just believes that the current situation, where the industry largely polices itself, is not ideal.

'There's a balance to be found there, but right now, we're too far in one direction.'

Heusch made it clear in his write-up however, that he has no evidence that any company is misusing
 the information or creating the profiles he described.

But he still believes action needs to be taken.

He said: 'Failure to address these concerns may diminish trust in health-related websites and reduce the willingness of some people to access health-related information online.'

Huesch's findings were published in a research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine.
