Three women from Florida brutally beat a 14-year-old girl  in a gruesome display of child abuse on Friday after the girl was suspended from school. 

Ishiyah McGhee, 30, Janine McGhee, 39, and Moriyah McGhee, 32, were charged with child abuse with intent to cause bodily harm--and they even smiled for their mugshots.

Police from The Volusia County Sheriff's Office responded to a call from a witness who saw the women chase the flustered girl from her Deltona home.

Ishiyah McGhee, 30, decided to model her orange jumpsuit with a big smile

The girl was only in her bra and panties because the three women had forced her to strip off her clothes so that they could hit her with belts. She appeared to be severely beaten down.

The New York Daily News reports that Ishiyah and Janine were holding belts and breathing heavily when officers arrived and that the three women were taken to Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach and have since been released.

The victim was taken to a hospital for cuts and welts and was given over to the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The Daily News reports that the women, whose relationship to the victim has not been released, went to the girl's school on Friday morning for a meeting about her suspension.

After the meeting is when the alleged beating began.

Janine McGhee, 39,  also sported a little smirk after being arrested for beating a 14-year-old girl with two other women

The ladies started beating the girl in the parking lot as they were leaving the school and it dangerously escalated.

They allegedly slapped her, pushed her against cars, and choked her by her necklace.

When the girl arrived home, she attempted to run away from the suspects who later dragged her to the house by her sweatshirt and choked her with the hood.

Janine McGhee allegedly tried to fight the victim and that is when the argument became increasingly violent.

The malicious beating continued until the police arrived at the scene. The girl's identity has not been released because she is both a minor and a victim.

The Mail Online contacted the Volusia County Sheriff's Office but no one was available for comment.
