Mod fashion queen Mary Quant invented hot pants and the Chelsea Girl look, helped 
popularise the mini skirt, created the skinny rib sweater and changed 
the face of make-up for ever.

And now, a sketchbook of fashion designs that a young Mary threw at her tutor in a rage for dismissing her ideas has emerged and is for sale.

Quant, famed for inventing the mini skirt in the 1960s, was a young college student when she went to Alfred Page with the book full of outlines of dresses.

A sketchbook of fashion designs that a young Mary Quant threw at her tutor in a rage for dismissing her ideas in the 1940s before she shot to fame has emerged for sale

She sought his opinion on a particular coloured fabric design but didn't like the answer that came back.

The designer in the making became hot-headed and hurled the hefty document at Mr Page before storming out.

The college lecturer kept hold of it 
and after Quant became a famous designer in the 1960s he passed it down 
through his family, telling them the story of how he came by it.

His granddaughter has now unearthed it and has made it available for sale in Dorchester, Dorset.

Mary Quant was credited for inventing hot pants and the Chelsea Girl look and changed the face of make-up for ever

Amy Brenan, from Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, said: 'This is a fascinating document that comes with excellent provenance.

'Although Mary Quant was a student at Goldsmith's College in the 1950s, students from all London art colleges socialised together and she met Alfred Page who was a lecturer at the Royal College of Art.

'According to the vendor, the granddaughter of Alfred Page, he told her that Quant asked for his opinion on one of the coloured fabric designs in the sketchbook.

Alfred Page, her college lecturer, kept hold of the sketches and after Quant became a famous designer in the 1960s he passed it down through his family

Quite a few of them have been coloured using gouache paint whilst others, like this, are just very basic pencil outlines including one of a wedding dress

'He told Quant that he didn't think it was very good, at which point she hurled the sketchbook at him and walked out in a huff. She never came back to collect the book.'

There are designs and outlines on every sheet of the 20 page book.

Quant completed each design in pencil and they depict female models wearing designs for full-length evening dresses or suit combinations.

The sketchbook is being sold with a pre-sale estimate of £200 on April 10

Another few pages appear to be designs for printed fabrics.

Although none of the sketches are signed or dated, a simple drawing of a box of Icimla face cream has helped to date it.

It shows the new floral design of the cream's packaging which came into being in the 1940s, previously, the face cream had been in a jar.

Amy Brenan said: 'These sketches are likely to have been done by Quant in her early years as a student, before she became famous, making them quite significant.

Quant designed the kind of sexy, affordable clothes her arty friends wanted to wear; tiny tunic dresses, knickerbockers, flared hipster trousers. Then everyone else wanted them, too

'It is clear from the quality of them that they are by a very well trained and skilled hand. It is a great collection of working ideas and designs.

'It is likely Mary Quant still holds most of her own designs which makes this sketchbook quite a rarity.'

The sketchbook is being sold with a pre-sale estimate of £200 on April 10.

Mary Quant's revolutionary innovations were tights for mini-skirts and waterproof mascara
