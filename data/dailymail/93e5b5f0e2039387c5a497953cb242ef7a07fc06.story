Georgia flesh-eating victim, Aimee Copeland's recovery is coming on, according to her father, who blogged  yesterday that his daughter is already able to do 200 sit-ups in seven minutes, thanks to a gruelling rehabilitation training.

Andy Copeland's pride was evident as he told how Aimee, 24, also completes a programme of 400 leg lifts in the same amount of time as well as 'planks' and 'sideplanks'.

To keep her fighting spirit in check, her physical therapist make Aimee say a complete sentence with each repetition, one her father says is usually something along the lines of: 'My therapist is a sadist.'

The long road: Aimee Copeland smiles bravely as she is transported to the rehabilitation clinic on July 2nd where is already able to do 200 crunches in seven minutes thanks to a dedicated physical therapist

The truth, he revealed in a lighthearted blog entry, is that Aimee loves the physical therapist at her east Georgia rehab clinic and is already stronger than a lot of people.

Andy wrote: 'At this point I have to pause and ask a simple question. How many of you can do two hundred crunches in seven minutes?'

The student's incredible recovery comes after just weeks after she was finally released from Joseph M. Still Burn Center at Augusta's Doctor's Hospital.

Aimee, a humanist psychology student from Snelville, had been recovering there after a zip-lining accident on May 1st left a rare flesh-eating bacteria known as necrotizing fasciitis, wreaking havoc on her body.

Pensive: According to Andy's blog, Aimee is made to say complete sentences after each repetition during her sessions which include crunches, leg-lifts and other abdominal strengthening exercises

Sticking together: Andy and Donna Copeland have been building an 'Aimee wing' at their Snelville, Georgia home as Aimee gets stronger in preparation for her prosthetic limbs

Doctors amputated one of her legs, a foot and most of both hands to stop the deadly bacteria from spreading and during the six week stint, Aimee drifted in and out of consciousness and on and off life support as doctors laboured tirelessly to overcome the disease.

Now that she has been moved to the rehabilitation clinic, her father says her determination is relentless and has already vetoed his plans to drive her around in a wheelchair friendly van when she returns home. 

Fun times: Aimee is determined to return to life as normal and was outraged by her father's suggestion that he chauffeur her around in a wheelchair friendly vehicle

Hippie chic: Old photographs of Aimee show an energetic and active young student who will no doubt be relying on the $150,000 prosthetic limbs he parents are hoping to afford to give her the freedom she enjoyed before

According to his blog post, Aimee's reaction on learning about his new automotive purchase was: 'No way! I am not going to be chauffeured around town like a handicapped person.'

Without relaying his concerns about his daughter's future driving career to Aimee herself, proud father Andy wrote: 'The simple fact is that between her ears, Aimee is 100%. She knows that she can accomplish anything she wants and that lacking the hands or feet to accomplish such tasks is only a minor inconvenience.'

Road trip: Though Andy joked that his daughter was a terrible driver even when she did have all her limbs, his tone turned more serious as he wondered how how she thinks she could drive with her disability

Both he and his wife, Donna, have been hard at work building what they call 'an Aimee wing' onto their home to make sure her life can return to normal as soon as possible and she can get on with studying for her master's degree.

The extension will include a bedroom, fitness room, sunroom and study and will be accessed by a special lift built by concerned volunteers.

In the meantime, the Copelands have also been trying to raise the funding to buy their brave daughter the $150,000 prosthetic limbs that she hopes will allow her to live as independently and actively as before her horrifying ordeal.
