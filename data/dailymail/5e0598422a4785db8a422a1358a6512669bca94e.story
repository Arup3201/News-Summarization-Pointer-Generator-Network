A new report investigating the impact of economic factors on expanding waistlines has found the popularity of Wal-Mart Supercenters and other warehouse clubs to be the single biggest contributor to the nation's weight gain.

The National Bureau of Economic Research's working paper - entitled Can Changing Economic Factors Explain the Rise in Obesity? - investigated the impact of economic factors such as the cost of food on obesity.

According to the report, people weighed more when the cost of calories decreased — which explained 36.5 percent of total BMI gains.

A new report investigating the impact of economic factors on expanding waistlines has found the popularity of supercenters and warehouse clubs - including Wal-Mart - to be the single biggest contributor to weight gain

The density of an area’s supercenters and warehouse clubs significantly affected the obesity rate, according to the study.

Opening an additional store per 100,000 residents increased an area’s average body mass index by 0.24 units, or 10.8 percent of the sample obesity rate, the study found. 

The overall effect: 'These estimates imply that the proliferation of Wal-Mart Supercenters explains 10.5 percent of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s.'  

Additional economic factors to blame for the obesity crisis included more restaurants, rising cigarette prices and fewer blue-collar jobs.

These variables combined, controlled for demographics, explain 37 percent of the increase in Body Mass Index in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010, as well as 59 percent of the rise in severe obesity, the paper found.

'We live in an environment with increasingly cheap and readily available junk food,' Charles Courtemanche, assistant professor of economics at Georgia State University, told the Washington Post. 

The National Bureau of Economic Research found that supercenters, followed by restaurants, as the economic factor with the biggest influence on expanding waistlines 

'We buy in bulk. We tend to have more food around. It takes more and more discipline and self-control to not let that influence your weight.'

Courtemanche co-authored the working paper with the University of Louisville's Joshua Pinkston, Christopher Ruhm of the University of Virginia, and the University of Iowa's George Wehby. 

Lower BMI results meanwhile were found to correlate with factors such as fitness-center expansion and increases in gas prices.

Obesity rates have more than doubled in adults and children since the 1970's.

While recent estimates suggest that the overall rates of obesity have plateaued or even declined among some groups, obesity is widespread and continues to be a leading public health problem in the U.S.

More than one-third - 34.9 percent or 78.6 million - of U.S. adults are obese. 

Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death. 

The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars; the medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight. 

The proliferation of Wal-Mart Supercenters explains 10.5 percent of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s claims the new report

This isn't the first report to link obesity to Walmart. 

A study published in the March 2011 issue of the Journal of Urban Economics found that obesity levels increased wherever a Wal-mart Supercenter opened.

The research 'tracked extensive health and population data between 1996 and 2005'.

They focused on areas of the U.S. where Walmart Supercenters moved in, providing the communities with access to lots of low-cost food.

'The researchers found that one new Walmart Supercentre per 100,000 residents meant an average weight gain of 1.5 pounds per person sometime over a 10-year period dating from the store's opening,' the story says.

'It also boosted the obesity rate by 2.3 percentage points, meaning that for every 100 people, two who weren't obese ended up in that category after a superstore opened.'
