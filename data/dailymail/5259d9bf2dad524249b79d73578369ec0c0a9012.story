A Massachusetts teen brought a Boston TV sports reporter to his junior prom - who happens to be dating Red Sox third baseman Will Middlebrooks.

Cameron Stuart, 16, launched a social media campaign last October to convince Jenny Dell to be his date, The Veritas reported at the time.

Stuart's campaign - called 'The Movement' - included using the Twitter hashtag '#HelpCamStuartBringJennyDellToProm' and trying to get her attention at a Red Sox game, the paper reported.

Dell said yes after she saw Stuart holding a sign with the hashtag before a November parade for the Red Sox, the Veritas said. 

On Thursday night, Dell came to Stuart's house - and shared a snap of the couple smiling on Instagram.

'Rockland Prom w/@CameronStuart15! #BulldogNation,' she wrote.
