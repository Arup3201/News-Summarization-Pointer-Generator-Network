A retired professional basketball player has been accused of stealing more than $14,000 worth of Apple products before pawning them off for a third of the price.

Former NBA pro Rex Chapman, 46, was arrested on Friday after allegedly shoplifting during several visits to a store in Scottsdale, Arixona.

According to police, Chapman would make it appear as if he paid for goods, including headphones and harddrives, at the self-service checkout, before visiting a local pawn shop.
