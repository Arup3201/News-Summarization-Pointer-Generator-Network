Tiny: Ms Greening made the claims for an intern working for her last summer

Transport Secretary Justine Greening has made two expenses claims for 10 pence on bus fares.

The Conservative MP for Putney claimed for the miniscule amounts of behalf of an intern who was working for her last summer while she was Economic Secretary to the Treasury.

The minister put in for the claims which were charged to an Oyster card on two mile-long journeys between Tooting and Balham, south London.

A spokesperson for the MP stressed that Ms Greening did not claim for travel expenses herself.

The spokesperson added that Ms Greening, who became Transport Secretary four months ago, always cover expenses for her interns.

A standard bus fare using an Oyster card currently costs £1.35, but would have cost £1.30 last summer when the claim was made.

Ms Greening spokesperson said the intern in question had a daily spending limit on their Oyster card, which is where the two 10p discrepancies came from.

The spokesperson added that Ms Greening was 'following Parliamentary guidelines' in reimbursing the intern's travel expenses, which they are entitled to claim.

Ms Greening's claim was revealed as the latest round of expenses claims were made public.

It total, the Transport Secretary claimed £76.20 on bus and Tube fares for the intern between last July and September.

In October and November, £3.5m of claims on office costs, travel and rent were processed.

When the expenses scandal erupted in 2009, some truly penny-pinching claims were revealed. Here are some of the best:

1p - Jeremy Hunt's phone bill for a 12-second mobile call

25p - A carrier bag for Labour's Anne Snelgrove

38p - Crunch Corner yoghurt from Asda for the wealthiest MP, millionaire Shaun Woodward

39p - Bob Blizzard bought a single paperclip

61p - Dominic Grieve claimed for 'cheese things'

67p - Ginger crinkle biscuits for Austin Mitchell

79p - Superglue for Keith Vaz

82p - A flapjack claimed by Garry Streeter

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Ms 
Greening's predecessor, claimed £103.20 for new business cards and 
another £72 for headed paper.

Mr Hammond was also criticised in 2009 when it 
emerged during the MPs’ expenses row that he claimed just £8 short of 
the maximum allowance for a second home in London from 2007 to 2008 even
though he lived in the commuter belt town of Woking.

The latest round of expenses revealed a typically bizarre selection of items which ministers charged to the taxpayer.

They include senior Labour MP Adrian 
Bailey's £13 claim for attending three Remembrance Day services in West 
Bromwich, as well as twice claiming £2.25 for 'tea and cake'.

The £80,000 a year minister also charged the taxpayer £3.35 for ‘cake, apple, coffee and two plums’ last November.

The claims are permitted under Parliament’s supposedly tough new expenses rules and were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

However, the Ipsa could not explain the discrepancy in Ms Greening's two 10 claims.

When the expenses scandal was unearthed in 2009, the cheapest claims ranged from 1p phone calls to carrier bags, paperclips, and even a 38p Crunch Corner yoghurt claimed by millionaire MP Shaun Woodward.
