Rumours are currently flying as to what Tesla’s big announcement, scheduled for later today, will reveal.

Last week, the car maker's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the company would unveil ‘the D’ and ‘something else’ on 9 October - although a time wasn't given. 

One of the announcements is thought to be an upgrade to existing Tesla cars such as driver assist technology, while the other could be a new sports car akin to a Bugatti.

Here comes 'the D': California-based Tesla is set to make two major announcements today. Rumours claim they may reveal a sports car that goes 0-60 in three seconds. The development was teased by chief executive Elon Musk on Twitter last week (pictured)

In an interview with Aspen Institute’s Walter Isaacson, Musk revealed that one of the features would be something current Tesla owners could just ‘turn on’, reported Vanity Fair.

He also confirmed that guesses on the internet were 'directionally correct, but the magnitude is not appreciated yet.'

Elon Musk has indicated that one of the announcements might be something existing Tesla users can just ‘turn on’.

This may indicate he will reveal driver assists, such as a system to monitor your speed or lane driving assists.

This may also be a change in the technology that gives the Tesla greater range.

Other rumours suggest they will release an electric supercar that can go 0-60 in three seconds, rivalling other cars like the Bugatti Veyron.

This indicates it is a planned upgrade to modern Tesla cars, or perhaps something they can purchase as an addition.

Theories about what the other announcement might be range from a self-driving car, a Tesla with greater range or an all-wheel drive vehicle.

However according to website Electrek, the announcement will be a new sports car called the P85D that can go from 0 to 60 in less than three seconds.

This would be a new ‘supersport’ version of the current Tesla Model S.

They claim a source has revealed ‘the D’ will be a supercar, which will be able to compete with other high-end vehicles like Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Ferraris.

And Electrek is banking its money on the other announcement being autonomous driving - possibly a form of driver assist.

Speculation suggests this may be technology that helps regular a car’s speed, and also warn it of any dangers when moving into another lane.

Last week on Twitter Musk said: ‘About time to unveil the D and something else.’

But when internet commenters revealed that ‘the D’ had some rather rude connotations, Musk let slip some more information.

‘I love the Internet. Comments had me literally ROFL. No, it wasn’t intentional. Glad I didn’t mention the other letter!’

However, according to website Electrek, the announcement will be a new sports car called the P85D that  will be able to compete with other high-end vehicles like Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Ferraris.. This would be a new ‘supersport’ version of the current Tesla Model S, and separate to the existing Tesla Roadster (shown)

Based on Musk's next tweet (shown) some have suggested the announcement may be a driver-assisted version of one of Tesla's previous cars, such as the Model S. In the image, the teased car looks to be similar to the Model S. Earlier this year Tesla revealed the 'Model 3' mainstream electric car

Some have suggested the other letter might be a ‘P’, although what either could stand for is unknown.

Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances.

The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes.

Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the year. 

Earlier this year, Tesla unveiled the Model 3 - a mainstream version of its other electric vehicles priced around £30,000 in the UK and $35,000 in the US.

At the time Musk unveiled his displeasure at being unable to call it the ‘Model E’ due to legal action from Ford.

The previous two Tesla cars are called the Model S and the Model X, and Musk apparently wanted to spell out the word ‘sex’ with all three. 

'We were going to call it model E for a while and then Ford sued us saying it wanted to use the Model E,’ Musk told Auto Express at the time. 

‘I thought this is crazy, Ford’s trying to kill sex! So we’ll have to think of another name.’ 

Exactly what the letter 'D' for the new announcement is trying to spell if anything, though, remains to be seen.
