A scaffold malfunction left two window washers dangling 69 stories high over New York City on Wednesday afternoon.

The incident occurred at One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western hemisphere at a staggering 1,776 feet.

The Fire Department of New York City rushed to the building after a 911 call was placed by someone inside when the scaffold broke sometime around 12:45pm.

Dangling: The scaffold malfunction occurred 69 stories high at One World Trade Center at around 12:45pm Wednesday afternoon

Rescue: The FDNY shared this photo from inside the building as they decided on the best method to safely get the washers inside

Terrifying height: The collapsed scaffold can be seen from blocks away, and crowds gathered near the building to take photos

Safe and sound: One of the workers is pulled in from the scaffolding by a member of the fire department

The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez, who has been a window washer for five years, and Juan Lizama, who has been on the job for 14 years. 

In the end, FDNY broke a window on the 68th floor to get the two men that were trapped off the scaffold and safe inside the building, this after 90 minutes dangling from the broken rig. 

The workers were going up the building when one of the motorized cables supporting the scaffold snapped or came loose. 

The two looked remarkably composed in photographs taken just seconds after they were back inside the building, and neither appears to have been injured. 

They were both taken to Bellevue Hospital with mild hypothermia said Patrick Foye, executive director of the Port Authority.

The two workers, who work for a company called Upgrade Services that contracts out to the Port Authority, were trapped on the south side of the building, and both were tethered.

On the Upgrade Services website, One World Trade is prominently displayed on the homepage as a featured client. 

A representative for the company declined to comment. 

Window washers have been seen on the building the past few days getting the building ready now that construction is complete. 

'This is a case where our first responders (were) working in tandem to have not one escape route, but two, to make sure these individuals would be safe,' said New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio.

'Thank God, Plan A, which was the Fire Department’s approach to get them out through the window…has succeeded and both of them are safe.'

He also added there will be an investigation into what went wrong. 

Getting a look: Workers on the site looked to see what was happening as the workers dangle 69 stories up

Clearing the area: Police and security ushered guests away from the building as the FDNY prepared to break the glass windows

Grabbing a pic: Bystanders snapped photos of the trapped men and some took video which made its way to social media

One World Trade, which stands where the Twin Towers used to be located in Manhattan, has only recently opened, with new tenants including magazine giant Conde Nast just starting to move in this week. 

The State of New York and Port Authority also have offices in the building.

Tense moments: A crowd of people look on before the NYPD began clearing some people out of the area

On the scene: A New York City police officer stands guard outside the building, where two streets were briefly shut down

First to arrive: The Fire Department says they responded to a call shortly before 1pm on Wednesday

Inside view: Just Tuesday Vogue editor Hamish Bowles shared a photo of a window washer getting to work outside Anna Wintour's office at One World Trade

One World Trade is 104 stories high and is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The new building was designed by  American architect David Childs.
