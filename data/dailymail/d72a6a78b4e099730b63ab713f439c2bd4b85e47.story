Louis van Gaal will be hoping his car trouble isn't a bad omen for him ahead of Manchester United's clash with Everton this weekend.

The Red Devils boss suffered a flat tyre whilst out and about driving and signing autographs on Thursday. 

And he will be hoping his team aren't similarly deflated in their upcoming game against Roberto Martinez's Everton side on Sunday.

The last time the two sides met in April, Everton won 2-0 at Goodison Park in a match that ultimately cost Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes his job.

United are coming off the back of last week's 2-1 victory at home to West Ham, but they will be without captain Wayne Rooney following his red card in the game.

Van Gaal, meanwhile, will be hoping to secure back to back wins for the first time as boss against an Everton side who are coming off the back of a long trip to play in the Europa League FK Krasnodar in Russia on Thursday night.

The Man Utd boss also stopped to sign a few autographs for some fans
