While Anders Lindegaard may not be at the World Cup this summer after Denmark failed to qualify, it's fair to assume the Manchester United goalkeeper is still enjoying his summer.

The Red Devils stopper's new wife has posted yet another stunning photo of herself, posing in the summer sun.

Sharing the snap on via her Instagram account, Misse Beqiri said: 'Summer it is...', as she posed in a black bikini.

The international goalkeeper married the Swedish model last month whilst on holiday in Mauritius.

Lindegaard tied the knot on the beach before tweeting: 'Best day of our lives! Thanks everyone for making it so special.'

Lindegaard's
 glamorous new wife, who attended the Manchester United end of season 
awards a year ago, also shared a picture of the happy couple with the 
caption: 'Luckiest girl in the world.'

The
 Denmark international posted a link to his new wife's instagram earlier
 this year and said: ‘Street smart and drop dead gorgeous. Thank god she’s mine.’

The pair, who have a son together, have been dating since 2012.

Lindegaard
 arrived at Old Trafford in 2010 from Norwegian side Aalesunds and has 
made 19 United appearances having acted as deputy to Edwin van der Sar 
and David de Gea.
