Millwall manager Ian Holloway tore into referee Andrew Madley for sending off Sid Nelson in their goalless draw against Reading.

Holloway's side had to play the whole second half with 10 men after Nelson was shown a red card for a late challenge on Michael Hector just before the break.

The referee had to get between two groups of players to calm the situation before it got out of hand.

Holloway said: 'It was a shocking red card. I watched it again and it looked far worse than it was. Sid was a split second from kicking the ball, there wasn't any malice.

'The players around didn't help with their reaction. Sid didn't deserve that.'

Reading boss Steve Clarke disagreed. 'Having watched it again, the lad was reckless,' he said. 

'In today's climate it's a red card. You would've got away with it in my day. Now when you make a tackle you have to be more careful. The referee was on the spot. He sees it better than us on touchline.'

Holloway started five players signed this month and though they were initially playing like a side who barely knew each other managed to carve out the best chances.

Stefan Maierhofer headed a long ball down to Lee Gregory who hit a first-time drive bouncing towards the bottom right corner but inches wide of the post in the first half.

Then in the second debutant Jos Hooiveld, on loan from Southampton, powered a header on target from Shaun Williams' free kick and Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici was at full stretch to push it over.

The first 20 minutes were starved of chances until Reading took the initiative.

Oliver Norwood sent in a corner from the right towards the near post on 22 minutes and Hal Robson-Kanu got to the ball first but his header was weak and caught by Millwall goalkeeper David Forde.

Four minutes later Norwood struck an effort from all of 30 yards which bounced awkwardly in front of Forde who got his body behind the ball.

On the half-hour Diego Fabbrini finally carved out a first chance for Millwall, wriggling between four Reading players inside their penalty area before digging out a cross from the left touchline, only for Federici to leap from his line to cut the ball out.

A game of vague chances suddenly flared up a minute before the break, but not for the right reasons as Nelson dived in on Hector.

Emotions from the sending off extended into the second half and increased the intensity as the sides traded blows.

A minute after kick off, Reading's Jordan Obita struck a shot into the ground after making a late run to the back post but it was beaten out by Forde, who then kept out Daniel Williams' follow-up from distance.

Then Gregory made a dart to the near post and powered a header that had Federici scrambling but fell, again, narrowly the wrong side of the post.

Reading took advantage of their extra man from then on, dominating possession but failing to turn it into a goal.

The point did little to help either side in their bid to avoid an end-of-season relegation fight.
