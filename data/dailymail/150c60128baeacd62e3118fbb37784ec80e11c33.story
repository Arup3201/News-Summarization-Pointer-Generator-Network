Jack Wilshere is at the centre of another smoking controversy after a picture emerged of the Arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub.

The England star, 23, is recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by Manchester United in November and is expected to make a first-team return by the end of the month.

This picture of Wilshere posing with friends and holding the pipe, reportedly taken at a London nightclub last week, was uploaded to Instagram on Tuesday before being removed, but then subsequently reposted on Twitter, leading to criticism from fans on the social media network.

The diminutive midfielder was back in light training for Arsenal last week 

Shisha or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco, usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar, through a bowl and hose or tube 

It is the third time Wilshere has been caught up in a furore involving smoking.

He was pictured holding a cigarette outside a London nightclub in 2013 and again at a pool party in Las Vegas last summer after the World Cup finals in Brazil.

After that incident Wilshere admitted he regretted his actions, saying: ‘I have been seen before doing it. I said then I made a mistake and I have made a mistake again. I am young and I will learn from it.’
