Speaking exclusively with MailOnline from the jail in Santa Barbara, 32-year-old Ruiz denied murdering the sisters and claimed he had been scapegoated by military police commanders desperate to find a culprit for their killings.

'I will not declare myself guilty.This is all a lie,' he said. 

'I am also feeling pain, just like anyone would who loses someone they have spent time with. I'm also in mourning for Sofia.'

Police revealed they are investigating other crimes believed to have been committed by the man described as a 'dangerous narcotrafficker'. Allegations include rape, murder and dozens of disappearances.

It comes as MailOnline can reveal 22 bullets were fired at Miss Alvarado and her sister in the brutal attack. 

Maria Jose was shot ten times while 23-year-old Sofia was struck by 12. 

Wearing a green and yellow baseball cap, red T-shirt and a pair of green Crocs, Ruiz seemed relaxed as he sauntered from his cell in the northern Honduras prison, through busy communal areas.

Ruiz denied allegations of leading a criminal lifestyle and claimed he was a hardworking cattle farmer 

Ruiz was arrested last week before and allegedly led police to the women's lifeless bodies  in a river bank

Denying his guilt, the 32-year-old said he thought he had become a scapegoat for military commanders 

Police claim he has already admitted killing the sisters and even led investigators to the muddy grave where he and three other alleged accomplices had buried their bodies.

But Ruiz insisted: 'This is all a lie. I have kept my mouth shut since they arrested me. I never confessed or said anything about the murders.

'This is the first time I have made any comment about what happened. I don't know where all these stories are coming from because I haven't said anything to any policeman.

'I will not declare myself guilty. The police needed to find someone to blame so they came after me. I don't know why. 

'They arrived at my house with 100 men to arrest me and had no respect for me or my family in our home.

'Now I'm only distraught for my mother who is hearing all these stories about me.'

Ruiz admitted he was romantically involved with 23-year-old Sofia, but said the Miss Honduras winner's sister was just his 'mistress'.

'I have a common-law wife back in my village, and we have a young son together. Sofia was my mistress, it's normal here. My wife and my mother didn't know about her. 

When asked when he last saw the two sisters, who went missing on November 13 after attending Ruiz' birthday party at a spa resort in the hills outside Santa Barbara, he declined to comment.

'I don't want police to find out what I am going to say at my court appearance,' he claimed.

But he said: 'I consider myself a quiet, hardworking man. I'm a farmer, I spend my day looking after my cows. What they are saying about me is not true.

'I'm worried for my mother, I was the one paying the bills and buying the food. Now she's living on her own with no-one, I don't know what she will do if I stay here.'

At his family home, in the village of San Vicente, ten miles outside Santa Barbara, Ruiz's mother Lucia Rodrigues said her son was a 'daddy's boy' who took care of her after his own father was shot dead six years ago.

His elder brother David was also gunned down in February this year, leaving just the two living alone in the large detached home.

The sisters had not been seen since attending Ruiz's birthday party at a hillside spa resort on November 13

The girls' distraught mother earlier revealed childhood photographs of the pair together as she came to terms with their tragic deaths

Set back behind large wooden gates and high walls, it is the largest house in the dusty mountainside village by quite some margin.  

Police have alleged the the family once ruled a powerful drugs cartel, with both Ruiz's father and brother murdered by rival gangs. 

Lucia Rodrigues said her son was a 'daddy's boy' and could not have carried out the killings 

Far from a quiet life of tending cattle, they claimed Ruiz had been give control of the cartel following their deaths. 

But Ms Rodrigues claimed her son was just a simple, hard-working farmer and said she refused to believe that he could be responsible for the young women's murders.

'It's not just because I'm his mother, but he is a sweetie and I miss him,' she said.

'He would always be calling me to stay he loved me and ask how I was. He'd come home with fruit or food he knew I liked, just so I knew he had thought about me.

'He worried about me and always reminded me to take my medicines for my nerves and high blood pressure.

'He became the man of the house after they killed his father, then his elder brother. He was a mummy's boy. He always preferred to stay at home with me rather than go out.'

Ms Rodrigues said she had no idea her son was involved with Miss Honduras' sister Sofia, a primary school teacher.

She said: 'He didn't tell me what he did when he wasn't at home. All I knew was that he spent his day looking after the eight cows his father left him. 

'He worked so hard, finished building the house his father started and paid all the bills. I never had to worry about anything.'

Ms Rodrigues, who also has a 25-year-old daughter who lives in the city of San Pedro Sula, 60 miles away, also believes her son's claim that he was framed for the murders. 

Ruiz, who lives with his mother in this house in Santa Barbara, was portrayed as a hard working farmer by his relative. Police however allege he lived a crime-ridden life, accusing the man of rape, kidnap and murder 

The farmer's mother, Lucia, runs this snack store in the dusty village. Police claim however the family has been involved in organised crime and drug trafficking for years 

'How can someone like that be the monster they are saying he is. I never once saw Plutarco with a gun in his hand. 

'I know (he) is not a bad person. But people will say, she is his mother and will always believe in him, so what am I supposed to say?

'On the night after the girls are supposed to have been murdered he arrived back home at around 9.30pm, ate his dinner as normal, changed his clothes and went to bed, no differently than any other day.

'It was a few days later when they came and arrested him. It was a complete shock to me.'

Breaking down in tears, Ms Rodrigues sobbed: 'My dream now is to see him set free. The first thing I've been doing every morning since he was arrested is to pray for my son, that God will give him strength to get through this. If he remains a prisoner, I don't know what I'm going to do.'

Back at the Santa Barbara jail, prison director Isidor Nunes claimed Ruiz' protests of innocence will not convince a judge or jury to set him free.

'Of course he's not going to testify against himself. Ruiz is a dangerous narcotrafficker and the whole town is frightened of him. Everyone knows what he is capable of,' he said. 

'He inherited a drugs empire and a fortune from his father and he is used to getting his own way, because he always had power and money on his side. 

Police discovered the sisters' lifeless bodies in a muddy grave on a river bank in Santa Barbara five days after they were last seen at Ruiz's birthday party at a spa resort

Examinations revealed the women had been shot 22 times between them before their deaths last week

'Maybe he thinks he will be able to buy his freedom, but I don't think it will work this time. His case is being dealt with by a federal judge, not by the court here in Santa Barbara, someone who won't be intimidated by threats or bribes.' 

'What you hear in the community is that he has raped women, threatened and killed people, and is behind the disappearances of lots of people who have dared to cross him.

'Not only did he confess these latest murders to police, he has already been bragging about his other crimes to fellow inmates in prison. He can't deny them.

'No victims have come forward yet but I believe they are waiting to see if he will stay in prison.'
