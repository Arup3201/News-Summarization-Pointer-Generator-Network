A teacher who force-fed a seven-year-old boy custard, restrained another child with a belt and slapped a third pupil across the face has been banned from the profession.

Amanda Whitfield, 60, made the boy - identified only as Pupil A - eat the dessert even though he was crying and gagging at the time.

The Teaching Agency panel ruled that feeding a child in this way was 'plainly inappropriate' and she was banned from the profession for two years.

Force feeding: Amnda Whitfield, 60, made a boy eat custard when he was crying at St Stephens Primary School in Launceston, Cornwall

Mrs Whitfield was teaching children with learning or communication problems at St Stephens Primary School, Launceston, Cornwall, at the time.

The panel was told on a separate occasion she slapped another seven-year-old, known as pupil E, across the face.

And the teacher pinched a girl, identified as G, on the nose to force her to open her mouth..

In a fourth separate incident she used a belt to hold a child to a chair and then did not report the incident to more senior staff at the school.

Feeding: A boy, seven, was force-fed custard, the panel ruled

The panel, chaired by Kathy Thomson, found five of the nine charges against Mrs Whitfield were proven as they ruled she was guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.

They said that the teacher, who had worked at the school for 20 years, had previously enjoyed a 'long and excellent career'. However, she resigned from her post in September 2008.

Her ban from the classroom is imposed by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

In their ruling, the panel said: 'The proved facts, in our view, indicate misconduct of a serious nature
 and conduct that falls significantly short of the standard of behaviour
 expected of a teacher.

'We recognise the challenging circumstances in which Mrs Whitfield was working and the complex needs of the children.'

They added: 'Mrs Whitfield's actions of inappropriate restraint, slapping a pupil and inappropriate feeding methods jeopardised the safety and well-being of children under her supervision; on these occasions, she failed to understand and act upon her duty to safeguard children in her care.'

Mr Gove said that there was a risk the teacher would do the same things again as he backed the findings.

He said: 'The facts found proved have put the wellbeing of young and vulnerable 
pupils in jeopardy. Furthermore, Mrs Whitfield has shown no real insight
 into her behaviour or the effects of that behaviour.

'The panel has judged that there is a real risk that her behaviours will
 be repeated given her apparent inability to learn from her experience 
and adapt her practices accordingly.'

The teacher now has 28 days to appeal the decision to the High Court.
