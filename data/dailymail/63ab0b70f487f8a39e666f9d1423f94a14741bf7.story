Arsenal would be teetering on the edge of the relegation zone were it not for summer signing Alexis Sanchez.

The £30million man brought in from Barcelona has virtually been single-handedly keeping Arsene Wenger's side competitive with his goals and assists this season.

Although this has been far from a vintage Arsenal season and they sit sixth in the table, were it not for Sanchez's crucial contribution of eight goals and two assists they would be in 17th on 10 points.

Sanchez has earned them an extra seven points already this campaign. Against Crystal Palace he set up Aaron Ramsey to turn a 1-1 draw into a win and his double against Sunderland secured victory.

He scored versus Leicester and Manchester City to salvage a point in both games and earned them one more against Hull by scoring and setting up Danny Welbeck's last-minute equaliser.

The Chilean's form is up there with the best, with 12 goals in his last 14 games in all competitions and it appears Wenger has found the goal-scorer he needed.

'His quality is exceptional, he takes responsibility and goes at people. He fights, he can score, that is what you want from great players,' Wenger has said this season.

Even being a modest 5ft 7in tall has not stopped him finding the net not only with both feet but in the air. After rising between two burly Burnley defenders to head in against them, in their 3-0 win in which he scored twice, Wenger said: ‘I didn’t count on him in the air at all.

'But I know that in the air it is more about desire and he has that. He is a winner and finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0-0. That’s what is important.

'We are in a job where you can always improve. He is unbelievably keen and every day wants to practise.’

The Frenchman has even compared Sanchez to Luis Suarez, adding: 'There are similarities with Suarez a little bit. By going at you, by being where you do not expect him to be in the box and by having that huge desire to be at the end of things.'

Given how Liverpool are so desperately struggling with out the Uruguayan, Wenger will not want to become so reliant on one player.
