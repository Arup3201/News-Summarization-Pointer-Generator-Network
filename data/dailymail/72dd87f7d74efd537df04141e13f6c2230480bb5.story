He hasn't bought a new car in 14 years, doesn't go on overseas holidays and takes home just a fraction of the money he earns.

Glastonbury Festival organiser Michael Eavis has revealed he takes a salary of just £60,000 a year, despite the event turning over more than £32million.

Eavis, 79, says he's not interested in the money and donates £2m to charity each year after paying his staff's wages and event costs.

The father-of-five says his take-home pay is so modest that he earns less than his top dairy herdsman at Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset.

He last bought a new car 14 years ago and does not holiday abroad, instead opting to stay at his holiday cottage in Cornwall.

'I suppose I am a lot better off than I would have been for sure, but I don't have millions or anything,' Mr Eavis told Western Daily Press.

'I get a wage of £60,000 but I pay more than that to my cowman.

'I am not going to buy a flashy car - I bought a Mini for my wife 14 years ago.

'I don't really like going on holiday - I just have a little cottage in Cornwall.

'There is no money stashed anywhere.

'We do a lot on the charity side - we aim for £2million a year.'

Mr Eavis, who has overseen 32 festivals in the last 44 years, said he does not like to carry over any profit into the next year - and gives any excess cash away.

'I like to go into the following year on the edge - I like that, I like the challenge,' he said.

'Yesterday, the girls said there is a quarter of a million left over. 

'I said let's get rid of it, send it on to the charity today.'

The festival employs around 150 people full time throughout the year and 25,000 during the event.

So far, Lionel Richie is the only name to be confirmed for the 2015 festival, which sold out in less than half an hour.

Eavis said he felt his team had done well when it came to picking headliners.

'There are only 30 headliners in the world - people who can pull more than 60,000 people,' he added.

'We have had all but two of them at the moment.'
