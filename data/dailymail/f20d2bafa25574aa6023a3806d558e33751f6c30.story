A scathing letter directed at 7th Heaven's Stephen Collins and his attorney charges that the shamed actor's estranged wife is being taunted with baseless accusations 'to create a smokescreen to shift focus away from the actor's despicable behavior.'

In the letter obtained by MailOnline, Faye Grant's attorney  Martin Singer, dubbed 'the guard dog to the stars,' by The New York Times, lashes out at Collins and  Mark Vincent Kaplan, for 'false and fabricated statements about Faye Grant to try to justify Collins' conduct.' 

Last week Kaplan pointed the finger of blame at Collins' wife of 27 years, claiming that she had been threatening to leak the taped confession for years.

Martin Singer, the lawyer for Faye Grant has lashed out at 'pedophile' Stephen Collins and his attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan, for 'false and fabricated statements about Faye Grant to try to justify Collins' conduct'

Accusations: Faye Grant has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totaling $14 million

'Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled,' he told TMZ. 

Singer's letter, sent Friday, tells Kaplan that 'it is outrageous that you would stoop so low as to communicate false and fabricated statements about my client to justify your client Stephen Collins' conduct.

'It is malicious and outrageous,' the letter continues, 'that you would choose to spread defamatory lies accusing my client of supposedly engaging in extortion.

'My client is not seeking a dime from your client beyond that to which she is entitled pursuant to California Law, and you very well know it.'

Grant has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totaling $14 million, including more than $5 million in property, an art collection worth $40,000, her husband's vintage guitar valued at $100,000, and his $16,000 Rolex.

Continues Singer, 'You are well aware of the fact that my client never used the tape at all in the dissolution proceedings.To the contrary, after your client refused to obtain treatment within a few months of the taping, my client gave the tapes to the NYPD and the LAPD.

'It is offensive that you are disseminating false and misleading statements defaming a victim like my client.' 

Singer ends the letter asking for an immediate retraction from Kaplan and warning that Grant will 'exercise all her remedies against you, by which you will be exposed to significant liability for defamation and false light invasion of privacy.'

Grant's divorce attorney, Larry Ginsberg, had also railed against Kaplan's accusations against Grant in a TMZ report last week.

The legal letter comes on the heels of new revelations that Collins could have molested at least one child as recently as 2007,  according to the latest allegations made by Grant..

Collins famously starred as the Reverend Eric Camden in the TV series 7th Heaven and according to Grant, her husband used the celebrity that came with that role to gain the trust of two parents so he could sexually abuse their child.

The hit show ran from 1996 until 2007, which means that Collins may have molested children well after the crimes he has allegedly confessed to.

An audio recording from a 2012 couple's therapy session in which Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to three young girls emerged last week. According to Collins, none of those incidents had occurred after 1984.

The latest allegations are included in an email that Grant sent her husband last year which has been obtained by TMZ.

New York City police announced last week that they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s.

The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a then-14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972.

An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed.

Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative.

She reported the abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations

'Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,' Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November.

The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed for divorce.

Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in a therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation.

Grant stated her husband has said two of the girls he molested were abused when they were between the ages of 10 and 14 years old.

She has also claimed that he had sexual thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant.

She said just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused.

'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because 'you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth' was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ.

'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added.

A source close to Collins dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely untrue.'
