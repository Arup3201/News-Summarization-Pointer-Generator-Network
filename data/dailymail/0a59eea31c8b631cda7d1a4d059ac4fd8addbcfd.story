Killed: Renisha McBride was shot in the head after knocking on a door in a white suburb of Detroit as she, according to family, searched for help following a car accident

A 19-year-old Detroit woman was reportedly shot dead in the back of the head while family members say she was searching for help early Saturday in a white neighborhood outside the city.

Renisha McBride was driving through Dearborn Heights, Michigan around 2:30am when she was in a car accident. At some point after knocking on the door of an area home, she was killed by the homeowner.

Now her family is demanding the man responsible must pay, but police seem to belive he killed her in self defense because he thought she was a criminal.

Police first said McBride’s body had 
been dumped in the comparatively wealthy suburb because of its proximity
 to the city. That story has changed, however, and now authorities say 
she was killed near where she was found.

And they’ve identified the man who shot her, though it still unclear whether he was even the one who alerted authorities.

Police
 won’t release his name or say whether he’s in or out of jail. A 
neighbor who spoke to police on the scene said they believed it was a 
self defense case.

‘He 
say, somebody tried to get in his house, or seems like force,’ the 
neighbor told WJBK. ‘He got scared and shot the person.’

But
 McBride’s family says that cannot be true, that McBride would never 
hurt anyone and simply needed help in a neighborhood that was strange to
 her.

And that doesn’t explain why she was shot in the back of the head.

Suffering: Renisha's family, including her aunt Bernita Spinks, say she would never hurt anyone and was shot out of racism, though police reportedly told someone at the scene it was a self-defense case

Angry: 'You wanted her dead,' said Dmetria Burnett of her cousin Renisha's killer. 'For somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice about it? He shouldn't be free at all'

‘He
 did not have to pull that gun out and he did not have to kill my 
niece,’ said McBride’s aunt Bernita Spinks. ‘Especially if she was 
leaving off the porch.’

McBride's cousin agreed.

‘You wanted her dead,’ said Dmetria Burnett of her cousin
Renisha’s killer. ‘For somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice
about it? He shouldn’t be free at all.’

Spinks said the man should have called 911 instead of just pulling out a firearm.

‘The police would have been pulling up in 2 or 3 minutes in Dearborn Heights,’ she said.

Spinks believes her niece died because of racism and wonders what would have happened had she been the one who shot a stranger: ‘Would I be standing here? No. I’d be in jail without a bond.’

Scene: Police haven't named the shooter, but local reports put the scene of the incident--and of Renisha's final breaths--on this Dearborn Heights, Michigan suburban front porch

Police have thus far released very little information on the case, which tragically parallels a case from just a few weeks back.

That’s when 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell crashed his car in North Carolina on September 14.

As he searched for help in a suburban neighborhood, he knocked on a door. The homeowner called 911 thinking that Ferrell, who was black, was trying to break into her home.

When police arrived and Ferrell approached them, he was Tasered. When he continued to approach them, Charlotte Police Officer Randall Kerrick opened fire and shot him 10 times.
