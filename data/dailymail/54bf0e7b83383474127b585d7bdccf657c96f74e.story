With breakfast being the most important meal of the day, it's pleasant to be able to devour it with a smile on your face.

And one hen owner had a particularly uplifting morning when her eggs came funny side up.

Pauline Whiting, from Newbury, Berks, reached into the chicken coop in her garden to find a smiley-faced shell grinning back at her.

Yolk joke: The bizarre markings on five-year-old Harriet the hen's feelgood egg, which her owner found in the chicken coop in her Berkshire garden

She had noticed her five-year-old hen Harriet laying a number of strange-looking eggs as she grew older, but this unusual one took her breath away.

The 56-year-old raced inside to show husband Henry the big, happy egg, which measured 3ins by 1.5ins.

Mrs Whiting, a dog breeder, then cracked it open and made an extra-satisfying omelette.

She believes the appearance of the cheery looking shell was down to the hen's advanced years - as well as her comfortable free-range lifestyle.

'I went to collect the eggs as normal and saw one huge egg,' said Mrs Whiting.

Cracking comedy: Pauline Whiting's prize chicken really made her morning with her entertaining egg

'When I looked closer I saw two shaded 
areas on the shell just like a pair of eyes and then a large curve which
made it look like a smiley face.

'Harriet is five-years-old which is 
quite old, and that can often mean discoloured eggs or strange shapes. 
But she has never laid anything like this before.

'It certainly made me smile and I like 
to think it was grinning because it was the biggest out of the lot and 
looks rather chuffed.

'I couldnâ€™t have kept it because it would have eventually gone off, so we decided to eat it.'
