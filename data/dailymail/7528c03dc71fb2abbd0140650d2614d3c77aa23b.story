What better way to enjoy yourself on World Orang-utan Day than with a celebratory drink. Willow and Jantan, Taronga Zoo's resident Orang-utans, did exactly that in their Sydney enclosure on Tuesday morning.

The hybrid primates were given an array of warm herbal teas to get them through the miserable rainy morning, according to their keeper Katie Hooker.

'It's not something Orang-utans would normally get in the wild, but it's just herbal, non-caffeinated tea and it’s part of the enrichment program we have for them, to make sure they get a lot of different things out of each day. We give it to them more so in winter,' Ms Hooker told Daily Mail Australia.

Their keeper, Katie Hooker, said they were given non-caffeinated tea as part of an enrichment program 'to make sure they get a lot of different things out of each day'

'They love it. We have lots of different flavours for them and they love the raspberry tea the best, but chamomile and ginger too.'

Ms Hooker went on to describe the practical joke that Willow, the 29-year-old female Orang-utan, recently played on her keeper, saying that like little children, 'they always try to push the boundaries'.

'She's incredibly intelligent. We run training sessions with them every day and as part of them we teach them to present different body parts to us which helps with medical treatment if they ever need it.

'When I train, I use a target stick, so if I want Willow to give me her shoulder I put it on her shoulder and say ‘"shoulder", reinforce her good response with my food and then I slowly start moving the stick further away.

'Recently in a session, I asked for her shoulder and she gave me every other body part - her nose and her foot and her hand - and eventually she went and got a stick and came back and decided to target my shoulder, so she decided she was going to train me.'

'They love it. We have lots of different flavours for them and they love the raspberry tea the best, but chamomile and ginger too,' Ms Hooker said

'They are facing a great threat from the palm oil industry,' Ms Hooker said.

'About 300 football fields worth of natural forests are being cut down every hour to plant palm oil and it’s found in a lot of products, about 8 out of 10 products on supermarket shelves including chips and cookies right through to shampoos.

'Farmers like to clear the primary forest [rather than re-planting] because they can get money for the timber they clear – and unfortunately the animals that are found end up on the black market.'

The greatest threat to Orang-utans around the world is the unsustainable palm oil companies, which clears up to 300 football fields of their natural habitat every hour

The Sumatran Orang-utan is considered 'critically endangered', with less than 6,600 left around the world.The Bornean species are also declining dramatically, with less than 54,000 left in the wild   

Ms Hooker recommended that Orang-utan and other wildlife lovers encourage the use of sustainable palm oil and sustainable wood, while avoiding buying wooden products made with Indonesian Teak

The devastating clearing of their natural habitat has led to the endangerment of the two Orang-utan species, with the Sumatran Orang-utan being labelled at a 'critically endangered' level with less than 6,600 left around the world.

The Bornean species are also declining dramatically, with less than 54,000 left in the wild.

Ms Hooker recommended that Orang-utan and other wildlife lovers encourage the use of sustainable palm oil and sustainable wood, while avoiding buying wooden products made with Indonesian Teak.

'Another thing that we can do is to write to the government to try and get them to encourage companies to label their products if they're using sustainable or non-sustainable palm oil,' she said.

'Currently, palm oil can just be listed as a vegetable oil, so as consumers we don’t have the right to make a conscious choice.'
