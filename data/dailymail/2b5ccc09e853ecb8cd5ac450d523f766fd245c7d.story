A girl has overcome cruel bullying at school to succeed at the usual combination of both kickboxing and as a beauty queen.

Charlotte Rowlett, now 23, from Sheffield, was living in fear  at school so took up karate to protect herself from vicious attacks from other students.

As a teenager, she competed in one-on-one fights outside the classroom and took up kickboxing to boost her confidence.

Charlotte is skilled at the unusual combination of pageantry and mixed martial arts

After training with her partner Danny, also 23, she went on to become a mixed martial arts expert, she turned her hand to pageants and was thrilled to be crowned Miss British Empire South Yorkshire 2014.

Charlotte, who works as a nail technician and trains at Marsdens All Styles in Hillsborough, was often tripped and kicked by fellow school pupils.

But she claimed gold and silver medals at various interclub competitions for fighting and performing technical katas (choreographed routines).

Charlotte said: 'I wasn't what you'd call a cool kid in school.

'I was quiet and had a small close group of friends.

'It started off with name-calling in primary school but in secondary school it got much worse - people started shoving and tripping me and locking me out of classrooms.

'I remember being spat on and people putting chewing gum in my hair or on my seat - it was awful.

'After a few sessions of karate I really started to enjoy it - it really boosted my confidence.

To marry her two hobbies, Charlotte has to abstain from fighting properly for around six weeks before a beauty contest to avoid getting any unsightly bruises or cuts 

'Bullies always look for an easy target which I no longer was - I walked with my head held high.

'Then I started a school yard relationship with Danny and I've never looked back since.'

Two years ago, Charlotte swapped her boxing gloves for nail polish when her mother Alison, 49, entered her into the Miss Chesterfield competition.

She went on to win her first crown and after this year's event in her home town of Sheffield is preparing to compete in the national Mrs Galaxy event next year.

Thrilled Charlotte married her kickboxing partner Danny, an engineer, in June after being together for 10 years.

Charlotte says doing pageants have helped boost her confidence 

She said: 'It's a complete contrast to be fighting one minute then dressing up for a beauty pageant a few weeks later.

'But I really love doing both and they've really helped me beat the bullies and show people what I can do.

'I don't fight properly for around six weeks before a beauty contest because there'd be nothing worse than turning up to a competition covered in cuts and bruises.

'I still do some training with Danny at home but we make sure we don't go all guns blazing in the build-up to a competition.

'It's a great way for us both to let off steam and I know he'll always help me with my technique to make sure I'm getting the most out of it.

'The pageants have helped me build my confidence even further - I never realised the amount of good work they do with charities - it's very rewarding.'

Grateful Charlotte has thanked her mother, Alison, 49, and long-term partner Danny for helping her beat the bullies.

The beauty queen said: 'I never wanted to go out and fight with people - it was just a way for me to feel safer if something did happen.'

Charlotte - who is the current Mrs Sheffield Galaxy - will compete at the national finals in February next year and if she wins will represent the UK in Florida.

The Mrs Galaxy event forms part of the United Kingdom Galaxy Pageants which specialises in allowing married women to compete.

Charlotte is sponsored by Sistachic Hair Extensions and Beauty and her dress sponsor and creator is KMR bespoke Bridal and Occasion Design.
