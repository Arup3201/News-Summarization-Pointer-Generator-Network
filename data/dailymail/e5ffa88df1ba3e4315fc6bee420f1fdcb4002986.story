Thames Water sparked fury yesterday when it announced it will not pay corporation tax for up to a decade.

Britain’s biggest water supplier has already been berated for racking up more than £1billion in unpaid taxes.

But as it reported soaring profits after the summer heatwave, finance director Stuart Siddall said: ‘It will be seven to ten years until we pay tax.’

Vetoed: Thames Water wanted to impose an extra increase on bills of eight per cent, but regulator Ofwat said there was no evidence it was necessary

Labour’s Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called it ‘deeply unfair’, saying Thames Water – which is owned by an Australian consortium – had an ‘obligation to pay their fair share in tax’.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy, who helped expose tax avoidance by Starbucks, said: ‘The reality is that much of this will never be paid.

‘They are never going to stop spending money on infrastructure, which means they will probably never pay tax. Companies like this have to say when and if they will ever pay tax.’

Troubled: Last month Thames Water had a 8 per cent price rise slapped down by a regulator

Thames Water can delay tax payments under government rules as it invests large amounts on new pipes and sewers. Its planned £4.2billion ‘super-sewer’ under London means it will not be due to pay tax for years.

The company’s sales rose 8 per cent to £976.5million between April and September, with pre-tax profits up by a fifth to £134.2million. Last month, its plans to hike prices by 8 per cent were slapped down by regulator Ofwat.

Thames Water said last night it would use any extra money from its capital allowances to help customers who struggle to pay their bills.
