Dangling like spiders 250ft above craggy rocks, this team of daredevil gardeners need a strong head for heights to keep the nooks and crannies of this medieval castle free of unwanted greenery.

As part of the work to conserve St Michael's Mount, just off the south Cornwall coast, this 'extreme weeding' takes place three times each year to ensure the walls are constantly kept clear.

The only way the four-strong team of gardeners can carry out their work is to abseil down the 50m high castle walls, located on an island 300m from the mainland.

Head Gardener, Lottie Allen, said: 'It is a thrilling and unique experience to tend these gardens which are designed to be viewed from above. On a personal note, abseiling allows me to appreciate the spectacular views of our gardens across the seasons and in all weathers.

A team of four gardeners abseil down the 250ft cliff face at St Michael's Mount off the coast of Cornwall to weed the plants 

The 'extreme weeding' takes place three times each year at the 12th Century castle to ensure the walls are constantly kept clear 

'We weed these areas three times a year not only to ensure the stonework remains intact and strong but also to allow the succulents planted within the walls, such as aloes and aeoniums, to thrive and flourish.

'Abseiling has become an important skill to complete essential strimming and planting of the many nooks and crannies within the cliff face where plants grow in spite of the salty winter storms and the baking summer temperatures.

It is one of only three places where 'extreme' weeding takes place, the others being Bodiam Castle in East Sussex and Scotney Castle in Kent.

In January, the team will be planting an area above the East Terraces with succulent plants such as Agaves and Aeoniums, daisy-like Osteospermum and Agapanthus.

They will also be pruning a large Puya – a genus of the pineapple family which has started to lean away from the rock face.

Photographer Steven Haywood  spent a day in mid-September circling the island in a boat to ensure he captured daredevil gardeners Jack Beesley and Darren Little from all angles.

He said: 'It seemed really extreme for two National Trust gardeners to be so high just so they could tend to the plants. But it's the only way they can, so it's a means to an end.

'The gardeners were specially trained to ensure it was completely safe.' 

Originally the site of a Benedictine Chapel, the spectacular castle dates from the 12th Century and is cared for in partnership by the National Trust and the St Aubyn family.

The family, which have lived at St Michael's Mount since 1647, donated St Michael's Mount to the Trust in 1954 – but retained a 999-year lease for them to live in the castle.

One of the most famous of Cornwall's landmarks, the island is steeped in both legend and folklore and boasts stunning panoramic views across Mounts Bay to Lands End.

It was a key port for trading tin to the rest of Europe from 350BC and was named after a vision of the Archangel of St Michael appeared on the Mount.

The castle has featured in a number of films and was used as the exterior of Castle Dracula in 1979 film Dracula as well as appearing in 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again, as two guided missiles flew over the English countryside.
