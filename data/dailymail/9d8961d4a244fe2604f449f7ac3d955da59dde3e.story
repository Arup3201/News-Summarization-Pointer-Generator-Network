Head of Sport Lee Clayton gives his view on  whether some of England's younger players should represent the Under 21s next summer in the Czech Republic

There has been plenty of talk of full internationals joining the Under 21s in the summer after Gareth Southgate and his squad qualified for the European Championship.

Arsene Wenger and Roberto Martinez have already come out and stated it wouldn’t be beneficial to their players to play and that’s no surprise as they will always look after their clubs’ interests rather than the national team’s.

That is a big problem in this country. My view is it’s not a black-and-white case.

Angel Di Maria is following the greats like Thierry Henry and Didier Drogba in taking England by storm so early... but can Mesut Ozil recover from his teething problems? 

Fully fledged regulars for club and country — like Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling — would benefit from a free summer.

But for players like Calum Chambers, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and John Stones — squad players at the moment for the seniors, who won’t play 40-50 games this season — it would benefit them and the squad.

That sort of tournament experience could be vital for the senior European Championship in 2016.
