A grand jury has refused to indict five students at New Jersey's William Paterson University who were accused of kidnapped and gang-raped a female freshman in a dorm, officials have said.

Jahmel Latimer, Darius Singleton, Garret Collick, Noah Williams and Tremaine Scott, all aged 18, allegedly restrained the victim at the campus's Overlook South residence hall on November 25.

They forced her to perform multiple sex acts on them, before preventing her from leaving the room, it was claimed. They were all expelled after the unidentified student reported the alleged attack.

The five were also arrested and charged with crimes including conspiracy, criminal restraint and aggravated sexual assault. They denied the charges during a December court appearance.

But now, the defendants have seen all the charges against them dismissed after the Passaic County grand  jury  decided not to indict them over the alleged attack in Wayne, officials said on Thursday.

Latimer's attorney, Ron Ricci, said attorneys for each of the men had provided evidence 'that this was not a sexual assault'. He added that the case had been presented to the grand jury on Monday.

'The facts demonstrated that this was not a sexual assault, and the actions of those young men were not in violation of the law. It clearly wasn't a crime,' Mr Ricci told The Record.

In reference to the publicity surrounding the 'gang-rape' case, he added: 'It was outrageous that these young men had to go through the publicity that they had to go through.'

In a statement to NJ Advance Media, Chief Assistant Passaic County Prosecutor, Lisa Squitieri, confirmed the grand jury's decision not to indict the five students.

'The case was investigated and then presented to the grand jury, but the grand jurors declined to indict and entered a no bill,' Ms Squitieri said.

During the alleged attack, Latimer, of Hoboken, Singleton, of Jersey City, Collick, of Paterson, Williams, of Camden, and Scott, of Vineland, reportedly blocked the girl's entrance at the dorm.

They then allegedly turned out the lights and used 'physical force or coercion' to attack the victim. They forced her to perform sex acts on them, before imprisoning her in the room, it was claimed.

According to the Record, which obtained the freshman's complaint to police, Latimer was accused of pulling the woman by the hair and forcing her to perform sex acts.

The other four men were alleged to have conspired to commit sexual assault, restrained another person unlawfully and exposed them to risk of serious bodily injury.

The defendants, who all studied at the university, were each handed $200,000 bail. However, this was later lowered to $50,000 bail by the Passaic County prosecutor's office,

The charges last year came just weeks after an article in Rolling Stone magazine described an alleged gang rape on campus at a fraternity house at the University of Virginia.

Defendants: In a statement, University President Kathleen Waldron said the school's independent student conduct process would continue despite the grand jury's verdict. Above, Singleton (left) and Williams (right)

The article detailed the alleged sexual assault of a freshman woman by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012. However, a police investigation later ruled there was no evidence of an assault.   

In a statement about the latest case, University President Kathleen Waldron said the school's independent student conduct process would continue despite the grand jury's verdict. 

'The University does not take any allegations of sexual assault lightly and will continue to adhere to all legal requirements and University policies and procedures in such matters,' she said.

'We are committed to the safety and well being of all our students.'
