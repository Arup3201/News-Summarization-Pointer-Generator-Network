Marks and Spencer was caught up in a new mis-selling scandal last night over its campaign to sign up energy customers.

More than 200,000 households now get their gas and electricity through M&S Energy but it is claimed many were misled over savings being offered.

For five years the retailer has had salesmen approaching shoppers in-store and persuading them to sign up on the spot to switch their energy supplier.

Mis-selling: An M&S whistleblower claims sales staff used tricks to bamboozle 
clients into signing up to new energy deals even though they might cost 
them more than their old supplier

Some of the sales teams earned up to £3,000 a week in commission for getting the signatures.

But the Daily Mail has learnt that M&S has suddenly banned its salesmen from signing up new customers in store because it wants to avoid further accusations of mis-selling.

The company could now face claims from thousands of customers and any victims referred to the Energy Ombudsman could be paid compensation of up to £5,000 each.

M&S has accepted that some 
customers may have been mis-sold contracts but claim it was ‘less than 
one per cent of customers’.

A
whistleblower has told how staff were trained to target M&S 
customers nicknamed ‘Gladys’ – meaning ageing women who would be keen on
saving money and easy to sign up.

Inviting: An M&S energy sales leaflet

The source claimed sales staff used a host of tricks to bamboozle clients into signing up, even though the new deals might cost them more than their old supplier.

The root of the problem was ‘comparison books’ given to all M&S Energy staff.

These were supposed to show customers accurate prices for gas and electricity from their existing suppliers, such as British Gas, and the prices being offered by M&S Energy.

But the books rounded up prices to the nearest £50, leaving scope for staff to mislead. Realising the danger the books represent, bosses have demanded staff return them all – with threats of the sack if any are kept.

The in-store sales teams are still being paid but have been forbidden from signing people up, the key part of their job.

All they can do is direct potential customers to go online or phone the M&S Energy helpline – as in both cases all details of the transaction are either audio-recorded or retained on computer, meaning the firm can fight any compensation claims.

The whistleblower said: ‘I’ve worked for M&S Energy for years – and while their party line is that only one per cent of customers were mis-sold to, most of us think it’s a lot more than that.

‘As far as I’m concerned the only people I didn’t mis-sell to were the tiny minority who brought their energy bills with them so they could do a proper comparison, or the small percentage who did genuinely save with us.

‘Our pay is around £12,500-£15,000 a year basic plus commission – and sometimes that commission was £3,000 a week.

‘Before we were told to sign people up on the spot, and if we weren’t meeting targets they sent us to find a “Gladys”, the official training term for an older woman considered easy to sell to.

‘People rarely had their bills on hand, which you need for a proper price comparison, so we used all sorts of tricks to get them to sign up, including doing rough estimates of their energy use based on the size of their home, but which we could stretch to our advantage.’

When the Daily Mail made undercover visits to M&S stores across the country this week, all the M&S Energy staff we could find refused to sign us.

The scheme is run in partnership with energy firm Scottish and Southern Energy, which M&S bosses are blaming for the looming crisis.

When it was launched five years ago, M&S executive Carl Leaver said: ‘The energy sector can be quite complex and we want to make it simpler for our customers.’

The relationship with SSE soured in April when it was fined a record £10.5million by energy regulator Ofgem for ripping off up to one million customers.

MPs and consumer groups called for criminal prosecutions for fraud as it emerged that many customers were persuaded to sign up to get gas and electricity from SSE after salesmen, including those in M&S stores, assured them they would save. In fact their bills rocketed, sometimes by hundreds of pounds a year.

Last night an M&S spokesman 
admitted that its energy salesmen were no longer allowed to sign up 
customers in store – and effectively accepted that its previous sales 
process had not followed ‘best practice’.

The spokesman said: ‘This is a past issue which SSE has taken action to resolve. We take our responsibility for selling energy very seriously and believe our new in-store sales process follows best practice by allowing our customers to finalise the sale process at home, staying in control of the final decision making.’

The spokesman added that the ‘comparison books’ seized back from staff were due to be replaced with computer tablets, but said Ofgem accepted they had been ‘compliant’ with regulations.

She said there was nothing unusual for a company to require staff to return old work property.

Hannah Mummery of the Consumer Futures pressure group said: ‘Energy suppliers have begun to realise that poor behaviour has eroded customer confidence – hopefully we’ll see better behaviour in the future.’
