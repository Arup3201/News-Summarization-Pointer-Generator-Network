Robin Williams’ half-brother has paid tribute to the star, saying he meant a ‘very great deal’ to him.McLaurin Smith-Williams, 67, shared a mother, Laura McLaurin, with the tragic comic - who was found dead from apparent suicide at his home in Tiburon, California, earlier today - and is still coming to terms with the shocking news.

When contacted at his home in Memphis, Tennessee, he exclusively told MailOnline: ‘I would very much not like to talk about this right now. He means a very great deal to me. Thank you.’

McLaurin has previously talked about how Robin and his other half brother Todd – who had the same father as the funnyman, but who passed away in 2007 – used to meet up with their families every year.

He told the Chicago Tribune in 1991: ‘All three of us grew up as only children - Todd, myself and Robin. I was adopted by my mother’s parents after her divorce from her first marriage. Todd grew up with his mother.

‘We all get along famously. Todd is no blood relation to me, but we’re real close.’

Robin’s first two wives, Valerie Velardi, whom he was wed to from 1978 to 1988 and Marsha Garces Williams, whom he was married to from 1989 to 2008, have yet to comment on his passing.

When contacted, Charlotte Filbert - who the Good Will Hunting actor was linked to in 2008 - sounded distraught and a little shaken.

She told MailOnline: ‘I’m sorry, but this is just not a good time right now.’

Following the discovery of the 64-year-old’s body, his wife, Susan Schneider, issued a statement. She said: ‘This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings.

‘I am utterly heartbroken ... It is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.’

Robin is also survived by his three children; son Zachary Pym, 31, who he had with Valerie and Cody Alan, 22, and daughter Zelda Rae, 25, who he had with Marsha.

Many who met Robin have fond memories of their encounters with him, such as Jonna Dzilsky, who grew up in the same neighbourhood as the Mrs. Doubtfire star lived with Valerie, in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles, in the early 80s.

She remembers how he used to give her and her friends lifts in his car, a red BMW, as youngsters.

She said: ‘He used to pick us up after we’d been hitchhiking. He was so funny.  I used to have a horse who used to get loose and eat his wife’s flowers.  And she would scream at me and he’d come out and say “oh, its OK they’re just kids.”'

‘I was between around eight and eleven at the time.   

‘He was crazy, he would pick us up if he saw us trying to get home, and he would do jokes and try and scare us in the backseat, he was just so funny.

‘He was particularly nice to me because his wife would scream at me all the time.

‘Whenever we saw him we’d flag his car down to get rides. We knew he’d be a fun person to hang with on the way home. And he always made sure we got home safe and he dropped us at our door.

‘To hear that he [took his own life] makes me think there is a whole layer of depression I don’t know about, and that I am thankful I don’t know about.’

Marin County Sherriff’s office have released statement saying they received a call at approximately midday saying a male adult had been found unconscious and that Robin was later pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation into the cause, manner, and circumstances of the death is currently underway by the Investigations and Coroner Divisions of the Sheriff’s Office.
