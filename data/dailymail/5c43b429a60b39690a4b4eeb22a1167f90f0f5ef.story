A Tory  MP spoke of  his ‘nightmare’ last night after he was forced to wait more than a year  to clear his name over fraud allegations.

The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that Peter Bone and his wife Jennie would not face charges over the funding of residential care for his mother-in-law.

But the MP said it was absurd that the police had spent more than a year probing claims that were without foundation, and warned that innocent people across the country have been let down by the police.

Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, with his wife Jennie said their 'nightmare' had come to an end after being told they will not face criminal charges

Mr
 Bone, 61, also claimed that the strain of the events contributed to his
 wife being diagnosed with breast cancer last week, arguing that the 
couple’s ordeal had condemned her to anxiety and sleepless nights.

Their
 constituency home was raided by police in March last year and they 
were  interviewed under caution a month later amid claims that they had 
misused funds from the sale of a house belonging to Mrs Bone’s mother, Dorothy Sweeney.

The police 
passed a file to the CPS in November but they only decided to drop the 
case yesterday. Mr Bone, MP for Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, told
 the Daily Mail: ‘This nightmare has lasted more than a year from the 
time when the police raided our house. It is just absurd that justice 
takes this long.

‘The trauma
 my family has been through is unbelievable. Our reputations were under a
 cloud for a year – and I am an MP. The shocking thing is that any 
innocent person in Britain can have this happen to them at any time.’

He
 added: ‘My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer last week. We would 
argue this ordeal contributed to it. If this had all been dealt with in a
 few months she would not have gone through all the sleepless nights and
 worry.’

Mrs Bone is locked 
in a dispute over care home fees with Northamptonshire County Council 
which is still the subject of a civil case.

Mr Bone said he and his family ave suffered trial by media

It
 has been reported that the Bones were under investigation for 
misleading the council about the sale of Mrs Sweeney’s home.

But Malcolm
 McHaffie, deputy head of the CPS special crime division, said: ‘Having 
carefully considered all of the available evidence, we have decided 
there is insufficient evidence to charge any criminal offence.’

Exonerating
 the Bones, he said: ‘The evidence showed: firstly that the woman’s 
mother considered the suspects’ conduct to be acceptable; secondly that 
the suspects acted openly in declaring the sale of the mother’s house to
 the council; thirdly that no element of dishonesty could be proved. 
Therefore we have advised the police to take no further action.’

Mr
 Bone said: ‘There were unfounded allegations made by the county council
 which took the police an extremely long time to investigate when they 
were without any foundation, which the CPS has made clear in its 
remarks.

‘We were 
interviewed only once by the police. We were never arrested. We were 
never charged with any offence whatsoever and yet this has been hanging 
over us for an entire year.’

Mr and Mrs Bone have already filed official complaints with the police and the local council over their conduct.

The
 MP said: ‘We were lied to throughout the process by the police about 
what was going on. People ought to be entitled to know what is happening
 and they ought to be entitled to swift justice.’

He
 said he will now raise the difficulty some people have in getting 
speedy justice with the Government’s top law officer, Dominic Grieve.

‘This
 is something I will talk to the Attorney General and the Home Secretary
 about,’ Mr Bone said. ‘It is not acceptable for anybody to be treated 
like this. We have been contacted by many people who find themselves in a
 similar position to us.’

He added: ‘We are naturally delighted that this nightmare has now come to an end.’
