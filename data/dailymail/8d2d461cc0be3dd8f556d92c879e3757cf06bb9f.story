The BBC has defended a controversial joke about Prince Harry which suggested the young royal had snorted cocaine.

Comedian Jo Brand made the quip on BBC1 quiz show Have I Got News for You on Friday night as panellists discussed the christening of Prince George.

The 56-year-old stand up star said: ‘George’s godparents include Hugh van Cutsem – I presume that’s a nickname as in Hugh van cuts ’em and Harry then snorts ’em.’

Comedian Paul Merton was seen gaping at the guest presenter, while a stunned Ian Hislop balked and asked: ‘Have we lost the lawyers?’

'Slur': Jo Brand read a joke claiming Prince Harry takes cocaine and editors left it in the pre-recorded show

The corporation is now under fire for 
allowing the joke to be left in after the pre-recorded show was edited. 
Last night it insisted the remark was ‘tongue in cheek’.

Critics have also attacked the 
programme for mistakenly naming Hugh van Cutsem, rather than William van
 Cutsem, as Prince George’s godfather. Hugh, a longtime friend of Prince
 Charles from Cambridge University, died last month.

Although Miss Brand did not write the 
joke, she has announced she will not apologise for the comment, which 
she read from an autocue.

The presenter, a member of 
anti-monarchist group Republic, said: ‘I didn’t write it. I read it out 
from the autocue. I thought it was funny. I don’t really understand what
 the fuss is about.

Watch the joke broadcast on Have I Got News For You on Friday night:

Allegation: This is the first and only time Prince Harry, pictured here leaving the chapel following the christening of his nephew Prince George, has been accused of taking class A drugs

Shocked: Panelist Paul Merton gaped at the regular guest presenter's comment, broadcast on Friday

'Defamatory': Ian Hislop (left) suggested the joke was defamatory saying, 'have we lost the lawyers?'

Not Hugh: Critics attacked the BBC for mistakenly naming 'Hugh'. Godfather William van Cutsem, here leaving the christening with wife Rosie, has a brother called Hugh and his father, Hugh, died last month

‘I am not going to apologise. I didn’t write it but I did say it so I am culpable in some way.’

Prince Harry, 29, a captain with the 
Army Air Corps who has served on two tours to Afghanistan, has 
previously confessed to smoking cannabis when he was a teenager. 
However, he has never been accused of taking cocaine or any other class A
 drugs.

Former head of the Army Lord Dannatt 
told a Sunday newspaper: ‘It might have been said as a joke but the 
suggestion is outrageous. It is a very unfortunate joke to make and most
 inappropriate.’

Honourable: The fourth in line to the throne has served on two tours of duty to Afghanistan as an Apache pilot

Tory defence minister Anna Soubry 
added: ‘That is disgraceful, shoddy, appalling and out of order. Prince 
Harry does an outstanding job in the Army and always goes the extra mile
 to help wounded service personnel and veterans.

‘Jo Brand should not have stooped to 
that level and both she and the BBC should apologise. It is a really 
cheap shot at somebody who has no right of reply and they know will not 
sue for libel.’

A Clarence House spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘We wouldn’t comment on something like that.’

However, the BBC said in a statement: 
‘Have I Got News For You is a satirical news quiz and the audience is 
used to the often irreverent humour. This was clearly a tongue-in-cheek 
comment.’

Historic moment: The BBC has also been criticised for its limited coverage of the heir's christening

The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the 
Royal christening in which two minutes and 20 seconds was devoted to the
 event and it was given bottom billing on BBC1's News at Six, presented 
by George Alagiah

It is the latest in a series of blunders by the BBC over their coverage of Prince George’s christening.

Jeremy Paxman forgot Kate Middleton’s 
title as he announced her return to public life on Newsnight last week, 
while BBC News was also criticised for treating the occasion as a 
‘tail-end afterthought’ on its six o’clock and ten o’clock bulletins.

BBC2’s current affairs show Newsnight failed to mention it at all.
