Britain could be forced to pay benefits to more Turkish migrants and their families after losing yet another EU court case.

The UK had argued it should be allowed to opt out of an agreement giving workers from Turkey the same benefit rights as those from the EU.

Ministers feared the Brussels ‘power grab’ would make Britain an even more attractive destination for immigrants and would lead to higher spending on welfare payments and pensions.

Britain could be forced to pay benefits to more Turkish migrants and their families after losing yet another EU court case 

It took the European Commission to court in a last-ditch attempt to get out of the deal. 

But in a ruling quietly announced last week, Britain lost the case and was told by judges at Europe’s highest court it could not opt out.

It means any Turks who are allowed to come to Britain to work will be able to claim benefits for themselves and their families as well as building up pensions, which they could then transfer back to their home countries if they retire there.

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘The British public quite rightly expect that those who come here should contribute.

‘We will be examining the full implications of the ruling.’
