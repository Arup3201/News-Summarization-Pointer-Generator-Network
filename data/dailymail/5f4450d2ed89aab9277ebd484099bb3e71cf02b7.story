Britain was given the green light to block welfare claims from European ‘benefit tourists’ yesterday following a landmark ruling by EU judges.

In a major boost for the Government’s reforms, the European Court of Justice said jobless EU migrants cannot move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves.

It ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job, and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers. 

The European Court of Justice ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits 

The ruling was widely seen as reinforcing Britain’s efforts to restrict benefit payments to EU migrants and was interpreted as showing that the UK can remove EU migrants if they cannot support themselves and are not looking for work.

David Cameron heralded the ruling. ‘This is good news and a step in the right direction,’ he said. ‘The right to go and work in another European country should not be an unqualified right. There should be rules about restricting benefits.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is an excellent ruling and supports our view that people coming to the UK who don’t have sufficient resources to support themselves and would become a unreasonable burden should not be able to access national welfare systems.

‘The case underlines that free movement is not an unqualified right and will have a major impact on the way the Commission interprets law in future.’

He said the ruling showed how the EU needed clearer rules to help countries keep control over ‘national welfare systems’.

The case revolved around Elisabeta Dano, a 25-year-old Romanian single mother who moved to Germany in November 2010 with her five-year-old son and lived in her sister’s flat in Leipzig.

She was capable of working but had never had a job in either Romania or her adopted country – and was not even looking for work. She also had a conviction in Romania for petty theft.

While in Germany, Miss Dano received nearly £150 per month in child benefit and around £100 in ‘maintenance’ payments. Neither of these payouts was challenged by the German benefits office and were not considered by the European judges.

Twice, the local job centre refused her application for ‘basic provision’ benefits worth around £300 a month to jobseekers. She made a court appeal and the case was referred to Luxembourg.

The court rejected Miss Dano’s claim and made clear that her right of residence in the country was dependent on her having ‘sufficient resources’ of her own.

The 25-year-old Romanian mother at the centre of the court case had tried to claim benefits in Germany without properly looking for work.

Elisabeto Dano was living in Leipzig with her son when she applied for benefits and her local job centre refused when she failed to take up jobs that were suggested to her.

Both the job centre and a Leipzig court said that Dano, who moved from Germany in 2010 to live with her sister, 'had not really been looking for work.'

Dano appealed her case all the way to the European Court which today ruled: 'States must have the right to refuse social benefits to unemployed migrants. She did not have sufficient means of support when she moved to Germany,' and therefore could not justify her right to remain.

It means she could not bring a case against the authorities based on EU anti-discrimination rules, the judges ruled.

It also declared that free movement rights are dependent on migrants not being an ‘unreasonable burden’ on the host country’s social security system.

The judges said Miss Dano had not looked for a job and did not have enough money to look after herself. As a result, she could not claim a ‘right of residence’ in Germany and use its welfare system as her ‘means of subsistence’.

They declared: ‘A member state must have the possibility of refusing to grant benefits to economically inactive Union citizens who exercise their right to freedom of movement solely in order to obtain another member state’s social assistance although they do not have sufficient resources to claim a right of residence.’

EU migrants who come to Britain are banned from claiming jobseekers’ allowance for the first three months they are here. For the subsequent six months they are allowed to claim, if they can prove they are actively looking for work – although this is to be reduced to three months.

After that, they must produce compelling evidence they are going to get work or they can be refused benefits. In January, ministers announced they were banning jobless migrants from claiming housing benefit.

Stephen Booth, of the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘This ruling reinforces many of the changes to the UK rules which the Government has already made. However, it doesn’t change the fact that EU migrants working in the UK on low incomes immediately gain access to in-work welfare such as tax credits and social housing.

‘The UK should therefore continue to seek changes to EU law to ensure that benefits are only paid to those EU citizens which have made a contribution in their new country.’
