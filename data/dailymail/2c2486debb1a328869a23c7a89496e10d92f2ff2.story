Parents have long complained that it is a daily struggle to drag their sleepy sons and daughters out of bed in the morning in time for lessons.

But a new study aims to show that lie-ins and a delayed school start could actually help improve teenagers’ exam results.

This is because their body clocks are behind those of adults and they are less likely to be ‘optimally alert’ during morning lessons.

Almost 32,000 Year Ten and 11 pupils (aged 14-16) from 106 schools will take part in the Teensleep project, led by the Oxford University Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute.

The scheme involves incorporating sleep education and 10am starts on to the secondary school curriculum and analysing the impact on GCSE results.

In the first year, a group of teenagers will be given sleep education – such as the benefits of getting enough rest – and the other control group will not.

The following year, one group of students will start lessons at 10am, one will receive sleep education, a third will receive both and a fourth group will have neither, continuing with normal school starts of between 8.30-9am.

Pupils will be expected to keep sleep diaries and some will wear electronic devices, measuring the length of time they manage to rest each night.

Researchers will look at the impact on attainment of five good GCSEs including English and maths as well as other areas such as the effect of mobile phones and tablets on sleep.

Professor Russell Foster, the director of the Oxford University Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, said that a teenager rising at 7am was the equivalent of 5am for an adult.

He said: ‘Recent advances in our understanding of the neuroscience of sleep has shown that the body clock of teenagers is delayed.

‘This biology, along with the impact of social media and other sociocultural influences, delays bed and wake times and greatly shorten sleep.

‘Our project will be the first large-scale randomised control trial to explore whether a later start to the school day, along with educational programmes regarding the importance of sleep, will have a positive impact upon both academic performance and overall health in the teenage population.

It could also involve highlighting the benefits of getting a good night’s rest to pupils, such as being more likely to win a place on a sports team if they are on top form and appearing more attractive to the opposite sex, researchers suggested (File photo)

Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine at Oxford University, said: ‘We know something funny something happens when you’re a teenager. You seem to be slightly out of sync with the rest of the world.

‘Of course, your parents think that’s probably because you’re a little bit lazy and opinionated and if only you got to bed early at night, you’d be able to get up in the morning.

‘But science is telling us in fact there are developmental changes during the teenage years, which lead to them actually not being as tired as we think they ought to be at normal bedtime and still sleepy in the morning.’

He added: ‘What we’re doing in the study is exploring the possibility that if we actually delay the school start time until 10am, instead of 9am or earlier, that additional hour taken on a daily dose over the course of a year will actually improve learning, performance, attainment and in the end school leaving qualifications.

‘If we adapt our system to the biological state of the young person, we might have more success than having to fit them into our schedules.’

The curriculum support will help youngsters understand the importance of sleep and eliminating distractions from electronic devices.

It could also involve highlighting the benefits of getting a good night’s rest to pupils, such as being more likely to win a place on a sports team if they are on top form and appearing more attractive to the opposite sex, researchers suggested.

The sleep research is among six neuroscience projects awarded grants totalling almost £4million by the Wellcome Trust and the Education Endowment Foundation.
