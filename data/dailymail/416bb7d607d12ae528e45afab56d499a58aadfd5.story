Angel di Maria has only been at Manchester United since August - yet already it seems his affection for the club has rubbed off on his family.

His wife Jorgelina Cardoso posted a picture of herself and their daughter, Mia, wearing Red Devils tops - with 'Di Maria - 7' on the back on Friday.

Di Maria signed for United from Real Madrid in a £60million summer deal and has certainly hit the ground running at Old Trafford.

Three goals in nine appearances - including a sublime chip against Leicester City - have already endeared him to the United faithful.

And now, it seems his wife and daughter have done too.
