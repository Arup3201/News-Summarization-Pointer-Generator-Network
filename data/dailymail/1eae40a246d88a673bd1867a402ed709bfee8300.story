Two teenage girls accused of strangling a pensioner are alleged to have told friends that the killing made them feel 'like heroes' from a violent video game.

The two 15-year-olds allegedly told pals that the killing had made them feel like characters from the notorious game Grand Theft Auto, in which players roam a fictional city stealing cars and killing people.

The pair from Udine, in north east Italy, are said to have told police they strangled 67-year-old Mirco Sacher, after he tried to rape them.

The girls, known only as A and F because of their age, are then alleged to have stolen his car and fled, driving some 40 miles down the motorway, despite having neither having a driving licence.

Investigation: Two teenagers from Udine, in north east Italy, are said to have told police they strangled 67-year-old Mirco Sacher, after he tried to rape them

Inspiration: Two teenage girls are alleged to have killed a pensioner in Italy and told friends that they felt 'like heroes' from the violent computer game Grand Theft Auto

Mr Sacher was found dead with his trousers down, in fields on the outskirts of the city, which is close to the border with Slovenia.

An autopsy found that the man had been in a 'prolonged and violent' fight before he died.

Two of his ribs were broken.

Prosecutors allege the pair committed a 
violent attack on the former railway worker in order to rob him and have
asked that they pair be charged with aggravated murder, rather than 
manslaughter.

Police are investigating cashpoint withdrawals around the time of the death on Sunday afternoon.

According to the testimony of two older friends of the girls, they showed little remorse after the violent incident.

Accused: two friends of the teenagers, who cannot be named because of their age say that the girls likened their experience to the controversial computer game, pictured, and were 'almost laughing and without any emotion' when they allegedly confessed to the killing

Sonny Rizzetto, 21, one of two friends to whom the girls confessed, told Italian television: â€˜Almost laughing and without any 
emotion they told us they had killed a man, started his car, and fled 
driving at 150 km/h on the motorway.

'More than once they told us ''It was like being in a video game, we felt like the hero of GTA."'

They had gone to a supermarket before the incident to buy high strength alcohol, planning an afternoon of drunkenness, he added.

Mr Rizetto said he and his friend convinced the two teenagers to go to the police after they heard the story of Mr Sacher's death.

Mr Sacher, who worked on the railways for 35 years, was single and lived n the house where his mother had lived.

Neighbours have described him as 'reserved'.

Grand Theft Auto, which is made by Edinburgh-based firm Rockstar North, has been criticised in some quarters for depicting carjackings, drive-by shootings and prostitution.
