Mike Jones put himself in the running for the worst Premier League decision ever when he cautioned Sergio Aguero for simulation earlier this season at St Mary’s after Jose Fonte wiped him out; he now has the worst two after a shocking penalty for Liverpool against Leicester.

Raheem Sterling broke away down the flank and crossed the ball. Leicester centre-half Wes Morgan was sliding to try and block the cross which he did as the ball hit him flush in the face. 

Jones, who was well positioned, considered the incident for a second or two and then blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty spot.

Sometimes players contribute to poor refereeing decisions with dives or play-acting but this was an error all of Jones’ making. He also awarded Liverpool a second penalty, again for handball although this time the ball did actually strike the hand of defender Danny Simpson.

Whether it was deliberate could be debated for a long time but Leicester manager Nigel Pearson summed up these decisions by saying they are random and that cannot be right.

One that could not be disputed was when Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green slid out of his penalty area to stop Swansea’s Wayne Routledge.

Somehow referee Anthony Taylor and his hapless assistant Matthew Wilkes missed the offence which would surely have resulted in a red card for Green had it been seen.

Taylor did show his red card later but he was wrong. Karl Henry went through Routledge with an overly physical challenge which did merit a dismissal and Routledge reacted by confronting his opponent.

Quite how Henry ended up with a yellow card and Routledge a red defies all natural justice and hopefully the FA will rectify on appeal. No wonder Swansea manager Garry Monk feels aggrieved at refereeing decisions.

Kevin Friend joined the New Year’s Day fun as he awarded Hull a free-kick just outside the penalty area when Abel Hernandez was clearly fouled inside. Friend later dismissed Antolin Alcaraz for the softest – wrong – second yellow card which of course cannot be appealed.

Add in the penalty that Stoke should have had against Manchester United for a Chris Smalling handball and Southampton’s Florin Gardos escaping a clear and obvious red when bringing down Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez when clean through on goal.

As you can see, it was another poor match day from the select group of referees.
