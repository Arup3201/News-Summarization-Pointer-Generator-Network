Britain is basking in unbroken sunshine today as temperatures soar to the mid 20s. 

But forecasters have warned sun-worshipers to make the most of today's rays as rain is on its way.

Weather experts at the Met Office have said there is a dreary week ahead for Britain as today's bright spell will be followed by heavy downpours and thundery bursts. 

The coming days will see temperatures level off in the low 20s, and cloud will sweep across the country.

Thundery showers have hit the UK in the past days - and a string of flood alerts have been issued with thunderstorms predicted to bring torrential downpours.

Stormy conditions have already arrived in Wales where, yesterday, a hospital worker was hit by lightning through an open window.

She was in the middle of her shift at Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, North Wales, when she was struck, suffering burns to her hand.

Patients said the strike was 'like a bomb going off' when it hit a communications mast knocking out the phone system at the 540-bed hospital.

Yet more rain is expected across the country on Monday, although it will be brighter between the heavy showers. This is set to continue into next week, with some dry and bright conditions along with light showers, he added.

This year has already seen record bad weather, with the wettest winter in more than 100 years in January and February.

Unsurprisingly, scientists in Reading have recorded the wettest first five months of the year since  records began in 1908, when a total of 18inches (457mm) of rain fell on the Berkshire town between January and May this year.

A one-mile charity swim in the sea was cancelled today because of forecasts of strong winds and 'big' waves.

Organisers of the Castle to Castle swim in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall, said this afternoon's event could not go ahead because conditions were likely to be too dangerous.

Around 400 swimmers had signed up to take part in the swim from Pendennis Point across the bay to the beach below St Mawes Castle to raise funds for the RNLI.

An RNLI spokesman said: 'The swim has been postponed because the forecast yesterday said it was looking bad for today, the wind was looking pretty strong and the swell pretty high.'

The event will now take place later in the summer but a date is yet to be confirmed. However, Cornwall is set for another fine day of sunshine.

A bolt of lightning blew the roof off this house during fierce thunderstorms which swept over Britain.

Emergency services were called to the detached property in South Molton, Devon, after it was struck at around 4.30am yesterday.

Five
 fire engines arrived at the scene to tackle the blaze, including a 
turntable ladder to extinguish the flames which had engulfed the roof 
and first floor.

The British Red Cross Fire and 
Emergency Support Services team also attended along with teams from 
Western Power, the Environment Agency and South West Water.

Fire crews contained the blaze to the first floor and roof of the house and were damping down by 7am.

David
 Bartlett, of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue, said: 'The building 
was struck by lightning which caused a fire in the roof space.

'It
 is not common for a fire to break out after a house being struck by 
lightning - it was unlucky it took hold and ignited something 
flammable.'

A spokesman for the brigade added: 
'The roof and first floor of the property was severely damaged. The 
ground floor sustained severe water damage.'

The aftermath: Fire engines from South Molton, Barnstaple and Chulmeigh went to the blaze

Residents living nearby described the lightning strike as 'like a bomb going off'.
