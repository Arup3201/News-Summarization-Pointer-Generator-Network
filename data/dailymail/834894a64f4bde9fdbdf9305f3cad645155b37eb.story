American fighter jets and drones continued to pound Islamic State militants in Iraq Wednesday, and military planners weighed the possibility of sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to Baghdad, U.S. officials said, even as the insurgents threatened to kill a second American captive in retribution for any continued attacks.

The airstrikes came in the hours after militants released a gruesome video Tuesday showing U.S. journalist James Foley being beheaded and underscored President Barack Obama's vow Wednesday afternoon to continue attacks against the group despite its threats.

The most visible threat to emerge came at the end of the video when Steven Sotloff, a Miami freelance journalist, appeared as a militant spoke directly to President Barack Obama.

'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,' he says on-camera.

Boom: The wreckage of a car belonging to ISIS militants lies along a road after it was targeted by a U.S. air strike near the Mosul Dam on Wednesday

ISIS jihadis warned in a video released Wednesday that Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist from Miami, would be the next to die if President Barack Obama continues to send planes and drones into Iraq to attack the terror group

Ready to go: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel talked last week to a group of U.S. Marines preparing for deployment to Iraq; the Pentagon said Thursday that as many as 300 more would be sent in to help stabilize Baghdad

According 
to a senior U.S. official, the number of additional troops currently 
under discussion would be fewer than 300, but there has been no final 
decision yet by Pentagon leaders.

Officials said that the forces, if approved, would mainly provide extra security around Baghdad.

The 14 latest airstrikes were in the area of the Mosul Dam and were aimed at helping Iraqi and Kurdish forces create a buffer zone at the key facility.

U.S. Central Command said Thursday that America's military have conducted a total of 90 airstrikes across Iraq. 'Of those 90 strikes,' CENTCOM said in a statement, '57 have been in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam.'

U.S. intervention has helped Iraqi and Kurdish troops reclaim the dam from the insurgents.

The militants, a trio of British jihadists known to their captives as 'the Beatles,' threatened to kill Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who they also hold as a hostage, if the U.S. continued to conduct airstrikes.

The officials who spoke to the Associated Press were not authorized to discuss the ongoing operations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

It was not clear Wednesday if Obama would have to adjust his recent notifications to Congress under the War Powers Act to accommodate the higher U.S. troop level in Iraq if more soldiers and Marines are deployed.

Currently there are about 748 U.S. forces in Iraq, in addition to the approximately 100 troops that have routinely been assigned to the Office of Security Cooperation in Baghdad.

Under the current war powers resolutions sent to Congress, Obama authorized up to 775 U.S. troops for security assistance, assessment teams, and advisers at two joint operations centers in Baghdad and Irbil.

Foley, a 40-year-old photojournalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. Officials have said the video appears authentic.

Horrifying: American photojournalist James Foley is beheaded in a video released by a trio of British ISIS militants known to their captors as 'The Beatles'

Released on websites Tuesday, the video shows a man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat.

Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen.

After the captive makes a statement, the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at the neck of the captive.

The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground, his head on his body.

At the end of the video, a second man – identified as Sotloff – is shown and the militant warns that he could be next captive killed.

Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013 and freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.
