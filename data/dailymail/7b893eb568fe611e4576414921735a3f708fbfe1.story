A new season means a brilliant excuse for a new wardrobe, and this autumn the best-dressed legs are wearing thigh-high boots.

Best worn with a high hemline and a flash of thigh, the over-the-knee boot has shrugged off any panto connotations and is now a High Street staple.

Kate Moss has always been a champion of this subtly sexy look, wearing hers with shaggy coats or boho dresses.

Daring takes on the look: Miley Cyrus wearing checkered Tom Ford boots and Rita Ora wearing prim Chanel in Paris

Peek-a-boot: Both Miranda Kerr (wearing Hermes boots) and Lady Gaga (in Balenciaga) show a bit of thigh 

The 39-year-old showed off two styles
in a recent film for shoe brand Stuart Weitzman and she's not the only 
celebrity we can be taking style notes from.

Miley
Cyrus, 20, clashed hers with a vintage dress on the red carpet at the 
EMAs, Perrie Edwards, 20, wore hers with a smart pinafore on a day out 
and 30-year-old Miranda Kerr teamed her Hermes heels with a graphic 
printed dress.

Thigh-highs don't come cheap though. Make yours work as hard as possible by choosing a dark colour and a wearable heel.

The favoured colour: Both Millie Mackintosh and Perrie Edwards of Little Mix opt for black

Two takes, one trend: Rumer Willi wears pale grey suede while Dakota Fanning chooses biker-inspired boots
