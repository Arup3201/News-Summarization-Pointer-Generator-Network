Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has warned current incumbant Louis van Gaal that he will alienate the club's fans if they don't start playing to their traditional strengths.

Van Gaal's tactics have been criticised by many recently with his usage of striker Wayne Rooney in a central midfield role one sticking point, while Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie faulter up front.

On Friday, United legend Paul Scholes described the Red Devils' brand of football 'miserable', while another ex-stalwart, Gary Neville caused a stir when he compared them to a pub side earlier this season.

The Red Devils manager has received criticism from Paul Scholes who called their style 'miserable'  

United travel to Preston in the final fifth round FA Cup tie on Monday night, where the Dutchman's ideology will once again be closely scrutinised - especially if the League One outfit cause an upset.

And Docherty believes Van Gaal must improve his team's style or face a wrath of disgruntlement from the fans.

'Van Gaal's record abroad is fantastic, with Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Ajax,' said Docherty, speaking on behalf of William Hill, Official Supporter of the FA Cup.

'All those teams played great football under him but he's got to start producing very, very quickly at United. The supporters will expect them to be doing better than they are at the moment.

'Once the crowd start to get on you if you don't give them what they want – and they're the ones who pay your salary – they'll start showing disillusionment with the way the team is playing.

'The fans at United have been brought up with great football – two wingers going down the touchline, raining crosses in to the strikers. That's not happening.

'You've got to give the supporters what they want, and you can't really see a lot of progress at the moment, with the money he's already spent, let alone the money he's set to spend this summer.'
