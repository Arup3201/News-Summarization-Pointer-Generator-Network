Frittered away: Dennis Harold, 60, spent six years stealing from London recruitment firm Devonshire

A City worker stole almost £3million from his employer then frittered it away on gambling, chauffeur-driven cars and a Thai bride.

Dennis Harold, 60, spent six years inventing fake companies and temporary staff to transfer funds from London recruitment firm Devonshire Appointments, where he was a payroll administrator.

Today the father-of-four was jailed for four years - along with a colleague who discovered the scam but took £1million to keep quiet.

The Old Bailey heard Harold, a trusted employee of 14 years, squirreled away £2.9million through more than 20 invented bank accounts between 2007 and 2013.

He then squandered an estimated £1.2million, much of it on his gambling addiction as he paid repeated visits to casinos.

He frittered away £97,000 on chauffeur-driven cars and taxis alone, as well as a 'difficult divorce' and sending money to Thailand where he had a fiancee or wife.

The fraud was finally exposed in 2013 when an audit uncovered a small discrepancy in the accounts.

Harold initially tried to cover up it up by presenting auditors with false documents, but when that failed he confessed to his bosses.

Yet his scam could have been stopped just a year after it began, the court heard.

Harold's colleague Shamsur Rahman, 38, discovered the swindle in 2008 - then demanded a cut of the ill-gotten gains to keep quiet.

Motivated by 'pure greed', father-of-three Rahman pocketed £1.1million which he used to put £300,000 towards a £600,000 house in north London.

He also bought a luxury £54,000 car and gave jewellery to his wife. 

Rahman, who is originally from Bangladesh, was later made redundant but continued asking Harold for money from the fraud, prosecutor James Norman said.

When Rahman's home was searched by police, they also found £120,000 in cash stuffed in a rucksack, a bag and a jacket pocket.

Harold, of Dagenham, Essex, who walks with a walking stick and suffers from hypertension and diabetes, admitted fraud by abuse of position.

Rahman, of Enfield, north London, admitted acquiring criminal property and pledged to pay the money back.

Jailing them each for four years, Recorder Michael Wood QC said: 'This was an appalling breach of trust by both of you.

'You, Mr Harold, were employed as a payroll administrator who was trained to use the computer system. You created false temporary staff to disguise payments to accounts controlled by you.

'In excess of 20 accounts were created and nearly £3million was taken from the fraud. It went on for six years and I have no doubt it would have continued but for an audit carried out and the fraud discovered.'

'I accept you showed great remorse - It’s hard to imagine a worse abuse of trust.

'You squandered your £1.2million in casinos and taxis and as I understand it you have nothing to show for it.'

Addressing his co-defendant Rahman, the judge added: 'Your motivation was pure greed.' 

'You were only able to repay the money because you were thrifty with the proceeds of the fraud, rather than frittering it away.'
