A disgraced detective who slipped away from his police duties to meet his drug dealer and buy rocks of crack cocaine was behind bars today.

Det Con John 'Sam' Griffiths, 31, should have been investigating Boxing Day burglaries for Cheshire Police but instead sneaked off during his shift to pay £50 to feed his secret addiction.

He put off colleagues who asked him to go to a house where there had been a break-in, claiming he was a 'committed to an inquiry', before appearing at the crime scene 35 minutes later.

Later, in the run up to another meeting, Griffiths texted the dealer saying: 'Mate it is my birthday and I want to meet you but last time it was rubbish. Is it rock this time? I will get a few if it is good', a jury heard.

Other texts read: 'Hi mate that stuff was okay on Friday but it was mixed. If you give me a pure bag I will give you £80.'

Another said: 'I'm hearing good things my friend, save one for me and I'll be there later.'

He also wrote: 'Ten minutes pal get me a good one ready'.

The officer was arrested along with his Albanian dealer Bledi Malecaj, 32, after police kept surveillance on them and watched as they completed a transaction near a hotel in Manchester.

Griffiths, who was based in Warrington, confessed he had been regularly using cocaine for 12 months.

He had become hooked on the drug after snorting it with a colleague because he was experiencing 'difficulties' at home.

He quit the force last April.

Griffiths, from Chorlton, Manchester, was convicted of misconduct in a public office and possessing cocaine following a week-long trial at Manchester Crown Court, and was jailed for eight months.

Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'Your conduct has greatly eroded public confidence in the police. The serious aspect of this case was of course that you were a police officer charged with public duties which are sadly are now behind you.

'You were meeting on a regular basis with criminals that were supplying drugs. On December 26 you put your own addiction before your duty.

'It is undoubtedly the case that because of the amount of contact you had with the dealers you were very close to them indeed. This is the shortest possible sentence when the public has been let down as badly as they have here.'

Earlier, the court heard how Griffiths joined the Cheshire Constabulary in 2003 and served in Ellesmere Port and Warrington.

Addicted: Griffiths admitted he had been regularly using cocaine for 12 months - sometimes with a colleague

He met his downfall after sending texts to PC Mike Burton in July last year that made reference to buying drugs and adding: 'I'm psyching myself up'.

The court heard that Mr Burton's brother knew a dealer and he and Griffiths would snort cocaine when out drinking after work. As his habit grew, Griffiths began calling and texting Malecaj directly.

The dealer would use names like 'Terry' and 'Eddie' during communication.

On Boxing Day last year, Griffiths had been working a 9am to 5pm shift investigating burglaries.

Richard Vardon, prosecuting, said he began using a police radio belonging to another officer who was off duty and at 1.16pm told his control room he was attending a call in Partington, which is usually under the jurisdiction of Greater Manchester Police.

Starting at 2.23pm, there was a series of calls between the officer and a drug dealer.

Mr Vardon said: 'At 2.46pm he was asked to attend a burglary in Warrington. He stated he was committed to an inquiry but would attend within the hour. The prosecution say this is entirely bogus. The police radio used by him cell sites in the area of Blackfriars in Manchester.'

At 2.48pm, Griffiths called the dealer, before leaving Manchester to travel back to Cheshire, where he arrived at the burglary at 3.21pm.

It was claimed the second meeting between Griffiths and his dealer took place the following January while he was off duty.

He was seen by officers in the Waterhouse pub in Manchester, where he bought a meal by card and got cashback to pay for his drugs.

At 7.38pm, he texted the dealer in 'a pally way' and met him near a Travelodge.

Police officers claim that they saw some sort of exchange between the two, at which point they arrested Griffiths and Malecaj.

Griffiths was seen dropping a small, resealable plastic bag on to the pavement, which was found to contain cocaine.

Malecaj was caught in possession of £50 and seven plastic baggies containing white powdered cocaine. He was later jailed for two years for possessing drugs with intent to supply.

Burton was arrested but later released without charge. He has now quit the force.

Griffiths said he has since given up drugs and found another job.

Det Supt John Armstrong, of the Cheshire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department, said after the case: 'Sam Griffiths brought the Constabulary and its people into disrepute by engaging in blatant criminality and he will now face the consequences of his actions.

'Improper conduct and criminality committed by those who are appointed to protect the public and uphold the law, will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly.

'Any officer who misconducts themselves in this or any other manner, will be subject to a thorough investigation and will face significant likelihood of a criminal prosecution and swift removal from the Force. Random and intelligence-led drug testing are adopted by the Force and any officer may be subject to spontaneous testing.'
