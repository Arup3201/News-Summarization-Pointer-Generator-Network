For Bebe, the Manchester United player that never was, it ended as inauspiciously as it began.

Last Tuesday, at the dingy Merseyrail Community Stadium, the home of Conference side Southport, the curtain came down on Bebe’s peculiar career at Manchester United.

Having underwhelmed once more for the reserve team, he was substituted after 45 minutes but emerged early from Warren Joyce’s half-time dressing down and took his place on the substitute’s bench.

It was there that supporters asked the Portuguese winger if he would be leaving this summer and with a big grin, Bebe brazenly replied: ‘I go, I go, I go’.

Fast-forward 72 hours and he was gone. Incredibly, for a player that did not start a Premier League match in four years at Old Trafford, United received £2.3million from Benfica and they are entitled to 50 per cent of any future fee that the Portuguese side receive.

In truth, it is a handsome return for a player who, sadly, never really belonged at Old Trafford, written off within six months by Sir Alex Ferguson and shunned immediately by David Moyes and Louis van Gaal.

Certain things, however, should be made clear.

First, that Bebe, aged just 20 when he joined, does not deserve this notoriety. His story is, to an extent, an inspiring tale of a young boy who lived rough on the streets of Lisbon and came to play for one of the world’s most famous football clubs. It is the stuff of Hollywood films, as Bebe was plucked from the wilderness and handed a place at Casa do Gaiato, a charity-funded orphanage in Loures.

Here was a player without even a Wikipedia profile, earning just £12,000 a year with Portuguese third division club Estrela, who had performed at the Homeless World Cup and now, here he was, playing for Manchester United.

If we take away the gross misjudgement by United for a moment and assess this on a purely humane level, for Bebe to be wearing the jersey of Manchester United was something quite remarkable, even if there was to be no fairy-tale ending in a red shirt.

Bebe’s contribution to United is encapsulated in a three minute YouTube clip called ‘The Bebe Crossing Show’, where a an appearance against Wolves descended into ridicule as attempted cross after attempted cross flew straight into the stands. On that day, Bebe, on as a substitute was himself substituted.

2013/14: Loaned to Pacos de Ferreira, plays 27 times and scores 13 times.

2014/15: Sold to Benfica for £2.3m

Sources at Old Trafford noted that the fame disorientated Bebe a touch and he was taken in by the bright lights of Manchester. His application in training, he later admitted himself, was not up to scratch although United coaches would also point out that his technical deficiencies meant he may already have been a lost cause.

Clearly, though, United saw something at some stage to convince them to pay the £7.4m buyout clause to release Bebe from a 5-year contract at Guimaraes in the summer of 2010.

United scouts had spotted him scoring goals in pre-season for his new side but it later emerged that Bebe was available for just £125,000 five weeks earlier at his previous club Estrela.

There has been much chin-wagging and conspiracy theories over the role of super-agent Jorge Mendes in the deal but it was another Portuguese man, Carlos Quieroz, that convinced Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill to commit to the purchase, despite the United manager having never seen Bebe play, either live or on the television. Quieroz, the highly valued assistant of Ferguson for several years, provided a glowing recommendation.

As it transpired, it was a reckless gamble by United but Bebe has gone some way to repairing his reputation in Portugal. Last season, he scored 13 goals for Pacos Ferreira in the Portuguese top-flight, an impressive return for a side that finished second from bottom.

In Portugal, the narrative of their post World Cup post-mortem involved much consternation at the decision to overlook Bebe in their squad for Brazil. In his homeland, at least, Bebe is now taken seriously.

It is a far cry from the days when United supporters at reserve games would sing, only half-in-jest: ‘If Bebe scores, we’re on the pitch.’

Bebe may afford himself a wry smile when he realises that he will be playing Champions League football this season while United are not.

Benfica, the biggest club in Portugal and regular challengers in Europe, are no small-fry outfit and for them to hand Bebe a four-year contract, they clearly sense some of the potential that Quieroz identified now coming to fruition.
