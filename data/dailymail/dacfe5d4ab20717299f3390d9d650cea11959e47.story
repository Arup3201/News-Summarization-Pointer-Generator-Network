St Patrick’s Day celebrations and Rob Ford sound like a bad combination and so it has proved after new video emerged of the Toronto mayor behaving erratically.

The cell phone footage was filmed by a teenager at around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday night.

In the footage, Ford is seen swearing, stumbling and acting erratically outside city hall while wearing a beaded necklace in honor of St. Patrick’s Day.

The footage was broadcast by CTV on Sunday night and features Ford calling someone a ‘f***ing idiot!’

The video starts with a woman speaking to Ford from her car, while her son films it.

‘No problem, no problem, no problem,’ Ford is heard saying in the video as he tries to hail a taxi.

After being hugged by one man, Ford approaches a cab and then can be heard shouting ‘f***ing idiot!’

Ford reacted with irritation when a CTV reporter questioned him about the video during the Patrick’s Day Parade on Sunday.

‘Give me a break, guys,’ he said. ‘Are you serious? Were you drinking last night? You never drink, right? You guys don’t drink.’

The weekend incident comes two years after Ford’s drunken St. Patrick’s Day party inside the mayor’s office and months after he swore off drinking entirely after he admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor.'

After his crack-smoking confession last November, Ford swore off booze entirely, claiming that he had a ‘come to Jesus moment.’

He admitted to drinking again in January after video surfaced online of him inside the Steak Queen restaurant in Etobicoke where he appeared intoxicated as he swore and ranted in Jamaican patois.

On Saturday, Kevin Spacey has hit back at accusations made by Ford and his brother that he doesn't take photos with fans, Tweeting a photoshopped image of himself wedged between the two politicos.

Spacey, who plays cold and calculating U.S. Vice President Francis Underwood on hit drama House of Cards, was reacting to a complaint made earlier in the week by the Rob and Doug Ford, who were backstage at Jimmy Kimmel Live on the same night as the actor.

The embattled mayor said he wouldn't know Spacey 'if I ran over him'.

Ford's brother called the actor 'an arrogant SOB', saying there were strict instructions that no photos were to be taken with Spacey by anyone.

The pair made the comments on their YouTube show Ford Nation, which is named after the mayor's supporters.

Along with the photo he tweeted, Spacey wrote: 'When did Mayor Ford start doing what people tell him to do? All you had to do was ask, guys. Here's your pic.'

During Spacey's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the actor cracked several jokes at the mayor's expense when Spacey appeared after a brief cameo by Ford.

'That's the first time I've had to follow a Ford,' Spacey quipped.

'And one that was so banged up.'

When Kimmel thanked Spacey for sharing a dressing room with the mayor, Spacey responded: 'Well, he threw up all over it, but those are the chances you take.'

Ford has been under great pressure to resign since he admitted smoking crack last year, and several videos have emerged that showed him seemingly drunk or high.

His antics have made him the target of late-night television comedians and embarrassed Canadians.

City Council stripped him of many of his powers but does not have the authority to remove him.

Undaunted, Ford has vowed to run for re-election this fall.
