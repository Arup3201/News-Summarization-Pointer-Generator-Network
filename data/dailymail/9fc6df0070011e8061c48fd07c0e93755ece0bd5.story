This luxury flat has been put on the market with a price tag of £9million - thanks to its view of London's hidden 'tropical' garden.  

The apartment block is situated on South Street in Mayfair, overlooking Mount Street Gardens, which was once a meeting place for Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower.  

Although the garden is open to the public, its entrance is tucked between two shops in the quiet area, and many locals who stumble across it are shocked to discover its existence.  

Luxury: A flat in this apartment block is going up for sale for £9million thanks to its position overlooking Mount Street Gardens

Tropical: The garden is believed to have an unusually warm micro-climate which allows trees such as palms to grow

Interior: The flat boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a large reception room and a dining room

The trees in the garden include several tropical varieties rarely found in Britain, including silver wattle from Australia, Canary Islands palm trees and Chinese willows.  

It is believed that the plants are able to flourish thanks to the garden's secluded location, which gives it an unusually warm micro-climate.  

This flat, which overlooks the garden from a luxurious apartment block, is being sold for £8.75million via Wetherell Estates.  

It features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a double reception room with very high ceilings and a dining room.  

However, the main attraction will surely be its location, as well as the view over Mount Street Gardens.  

Location, location, location: The apartment block is situated in the heart of Mayfair, overlooking the relatively little-known garden

Dining room: The lucky new owner will be able to host in style in the £9million flat, being sold by Wetherell Estates

Classy: The living room with its grand piano is reminiscent of the lifestyle enjoyed by fictional aristocrats such as Bertie Wooster

Corridors: The hallway next to the staircase is pictured left; on the right is another corridor with an ornate window

The land originally formed part of a huge fortification dating from the English Civil War, where Oliver Cromwell defended the capital against royalist troops.  

It then served as a graveyard and burial ground before being converted into a garden in 1889, at a time when Mayfair was rapidly becoming one of London's most fashionable areas.  

During the Second World War, Winston Churchill and General Dwight D. Eisenhower would walk in Mount Street Gardens while discussing how to defeat the Nazis.  

Eisenhower was based in nearby Grosvenor Square, headquarter of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied High Command.  

Fashionable: The block of flats as it appears from South Street, located in one of the most expensive areas in the country

Entrance: The building is entered through this striking antique doorway

View: The flat looks right over Mount Street Gardens, which is unknown even by many locals

Green: The master bedroom looks out onto a relatively rural scene, with trees crowding the landscape as well as other apartment blocks

In the intervening decades, the garden has become particularly popular with Americans, thanks to its location near the U.S. Embassy.  

Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell, said: 'These wonderful Mount Street Gardens are Mayfair's best hidden secret.  

'Hidden behind the boutique shops of Mount Street and yet close to Park Lane and Oxford Street they provide a secret and tranquil oasis of greenery in the heart of London's West End.  

'The views from the apartment onto the gardens are superb, and the view is simply priceless.'
