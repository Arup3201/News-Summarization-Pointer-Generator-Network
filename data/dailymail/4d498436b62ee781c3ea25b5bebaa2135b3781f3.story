Guinea pigs which have no fur are the latest pet craze sweeping across Britain, but animal campaigners say the sickly pets are a huge responsibility

The wrinkly skinny pigs, which are selling for £120 each, are almost completely bald and have to live inside with their owners during the winter to keep warm.

The cute creatures, which look like the Clangers from 1970's kids TV, do not occur in the wild and were a genetic mutation, created in The Institute Armand Frappier lab in Montreal in Canada in 1978.

Bald: Skinny pigs, which are naturally hairless, are growing in popularity as pets and sell for around £120. But animal campaigners say they can suffer health problems and urged pet lovers to think twice before buying

A spokeswoman from the RSPCA said the lack of fur can cause unnecessary pain, discomfort, illness and behavioural problems and that no animal should be bred primarily for how it looks.

She added: 'The RSPCA wouldn't recommend people buy these animals due to the welfare problems associated with selectively breeding them for lack of hair, and because they will have complex needs that must be met to keep them happy and healthy.

'Animal charities are full to the brim with small animals looking for homes, and we would urge anyone interested in having a pet to consider re-homing a compatible pair of rescue guinea pigs instead.'

The chief vet of animal welfare charity Blue Cross, Caroline Reay, has concerns about the increasing commoditisation of animals, including the rise of ‘handbag’ and wolf-like dogs.

She said: 'Many pets are bred for particular traits, but when choosing any pet, you should never base the decision on appearance alone.

'It’s really important to remember that "skinny pigs" have the same welfare needs as regular guinea pigs, although with a hairless variety, owners will also need to give extra protection from the cold, sun and injury, which their fur would usually provide.

'The main concern for Blue Cross is that it is increasingly easy to buy a pet on a whim without giving proper thought to the commitment needed.'

Their lack of hair has made them hugely popular with allergy sufferers and an increasing number of Brits are buying the coat-free guinea pigs as family pets.

'I've always been fascinated by unusual pets and when I saw my first skinny pig I knew I had to have one,' said Karen Brown, who looks after more than 40 skinny pigs in her home and is the leading breeder in the UK.

'I bought a lilac and white sow called "Peanut", and so it all began. I love the fact they live indoors with me and they have become like part of the family.

Cute: Skinny pigs have only tiny tufts of hair on their noses and feet

'They are cheeky, inquisitive, gentle and friendly, so they are good fun and make great pets.'

Skinny pigs have tiny tufts of hair on their noses and feet, but otherwise they are completely naked from birth, with their plump bodies and stumpy legs on show.

They come in a variety of skin colours, including albino, chocolate, silver, cinnamon, lilac, white, golden and even Dalmatian - which are white with black spots.

'I love the Dalmatian markings on any guinea pig and find it particularly striking in the hairless," added Karen.

The markings on the animals vary, with chocolate brown being a popular choice among pet lovers

'My favourite colour is chocolate. They are the most popular alongside well marked darker Dalmatians.'

Unlike traditional guinea pigs, skinnies cannot live outside as they would never survive the cold and have to be kept warm in a heated home.

On warm sunny days they can graze in the garden, but need sun-cream of factor 50+ so their delicate skin does not get burnt by the sun.

Skinnies also have a higher metabolism than normal guinea pigs in order to maintain their body heat, which means they eat a lot of food.

'They will happily munch away all day long,' said Karen, who runs KabSkinnies in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

'They can also be messy as they never manage to keep all the bedding in their cages and quite noisy too.

'They soon learn to recognise a fridge door opening or the rustle of a bag that could mean food, and a whole herd can start calling loudly in anticipation of being fed.

'They are really entertaining little creatures and have great personalities.'

The cute creatures, which are now ethically bred in the UK, can live up to six years and enjoy the company of other skinnies and their owners.

She added: 'They are always better pets if handled well from birth and boars usually being more affectionate than sows.

'It's so hard to imagine my precious little skinny pigs have descended from lab animals.'
