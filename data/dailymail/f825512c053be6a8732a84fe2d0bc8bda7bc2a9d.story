This is the dramatic moment rescue workers finally began the process of winching a cave explorer to safety after he spent a week trapped 3,200 feet below ground.

Johann
 Westhauser, 52, suffered serious head injuries seven days ago while exploring 
the Alpine Riesending cave system near the Berchtesgaden, close to the Austrian
 border.

The £2million process to bring him to the surface is expected to take several days, but finally got under way after doctors assisted 
by 200 rescue specialists climbed two and half miles down into the cave to treat Mr Westhauser and make sure he was well enough to be 
brought out.

Transport: Rescue workers finally started the process of winching injured cave explorer Johann Westhauser to safety yesterday after he spent a week trapped 3,200 feet below ground

Rescuers had strapped Mr Westhauser to a stretcher (pictured), as they transported him through the labyrinth

The first words Mr Westhauser uttered upon seeing Italian rescue workers approach him on Saturday morning were: 'I am feeling OK.'

After two days treating him inside the caves, rescuers finally strapped Mr Westhauser to a stretcher, with the process to carry him out of the network of tunnels now well under way.

'We are very glad that the patient is able to tolerate the transport so well,' doctor Johannes Schiffer said. But it will still take several more days to get Mr Westhauser to the surface.He has a heating system and a neck brace attached to him in a bid to avoid further brain swelling on his journey back to the light.

Some German media reported that doctors considered boring into his skull while underground to relieve pressure on his brain, but it is unclear whether this procedure was actually carried out.

Johann Westhauser may have been trapped for a week, but a group of Chilean miners hold the world record for surviving the longest time stuck below ground.

The 33 men were trapped for a total of 69 days following the collapse of the San José copper-gold mine on August 5, 2010.

It wasn't until October 13 that the last miner was lifted to safety in a tiny capsule that could only hold one person at a time and took a full 15 minutes to reach the surface.

All 33 miners survived the traumatic ordeal, with almost all of them in a good medical condition with no long-term physical effects.

Part of their incredible feat of survival was due to a spirit among the men that they must simply accept their situation and not panic.

Despite having 
suffered a serious brain injury, certain passages within the caves are so narrow that the explorer will be expected to get up and walk himself.

Foam, of the type used in building to insulate walls, has been sprayed on him to both cushion and warm him on his journey. He is also medicated - tranquilized, in effect - to keep him calm in the cold, pitch darkness where progress is agonisingly slow.

There are, for example, five shafts measuring 200 feet each, that he must be pulled up with only a few centimetres between him and the dripping rock face.

Mr Westhauser was seriously injured by a falling rock while he was wearing a helmet during the early hours of last Sunday morning.

By
 the time a paramedic reached his side he was already showing the first 
signs of hypothermia, as the temperature in the spot where he is lying 
underground never reaches above 3C.

It
 can only be reached by crawling through a labyrinth of tiny spaces, 
rappelling down sheer drops and making difficult climes in the pitch 
dark.

If weather makes air support impossible, the Bavarian Mountain Rescue service (members of which are pictured) says it will make the trips using pack mules

Mr Westhauser, who 
works as a physicist in Karlsruhe, is strapped into a specialised 
stretcher, wrapped in a sleeping bag and layers of styrofoam to keep him
 warm.

A
 doctor with the rescue party is carrying a skull drill in case he 
begins to suffer bleeding on the brain, which could cause the pressure 
in his skull to rise to dangerous levels.

The
 mission to bring out Mr Westhauser is becoming a race against time. Storms are 
forecast for the area where the cave entrance is located. Heavy rain 
could flood the cave, which acts as a drainage system for the mountains.

Helicopters have been 
making up to ten trips a day to the entrance to the cave system, which 
is 6,000ft up in the Bavarian Alps. If weather makes air support 
impossible, the Bavarian Mountain Rescue service says it will make the 
trips using pack mules.

Specialist rescue workers from Switzerland and Italy have arrived to help with the arduous rescue effort, which could take up to several more days and even weeks

German
 newspapers are already beginning to ask questions about the cost of the
 rescue operation, but authorities are refusing to comment on how much 
has been spent.

Stefan 
Schneider, deputy director of the Bavarian Mountain rescue, told 
Suddeutsche Zeitung: 'For us, salvation is at the forefront.

'We do not ask if someone is insured or not – we are committed to the rescue.'

Cave rescue specialists from Germany, Italy and Switzerland have all been drafted in as part of the rescue mission.

The
 giant Riesending complex is under the Untersberg mountain range. 
According to legend, the Holy Roman Emperor sleeps beneath the mountains
 and will one day emerge to lead Germany to glory.

The
 entrance to the caves was only discovered in 1995. Mr Westhauser's 
expedition had set out to map uncharted areas of the cave and was 
scheduled to take a month.
