A toddler who has cheated death three times is recovering back home with his delighted parents.

Carla Drew, 24, and Kevin Davidson, were convinced they were going to lose their son Olly after his stomach was born outside of his body.

He came through the ordeal but needed CPR at nine weeks old. Then just four months later, the couple were told Olly had a liver tumour and needed chemotherapy straight away.

Little miracle: Ollie with his mother Carla, who was convinced she would lose him

The 16-month-old has now finished treatment, and is recovering well at home in Benton, North Tyneside, with the help of his big sister Lily, three.

His mother said: 'We will never do the lottery because we are already the luckiest people alive.

'I think when even the doctors are saying "we don't know how he is still here", you know your son is special.

'I never expected him to come back from any of his operations, but here he is.'

Olly, pictured here with mother Carla, father Kevin and sister Lily, suffers from the rare Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder which puts him at risk of cancer and other illnesses

The toddler suffers from the rare Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder which puts him at risk of cancer and other illnesses. 

His parents were repeatedly told to expect the worst, and due to his fighting spirit, now describe him as their 'little miracle'.

Mr and Mrs Davidson found out about Olly's condition when he was in the womb.

The odds were stacked against Olly but now he is back at home and learning to walk

Doctors had to operate immediately after he was born to correct his stomach, and it wasn't until 15 days later that he could be held by his parents. 

Mrs Davidson, a full-time mother, remembers gazing at her newborn baby as he was treated in an intensive care unit.

She said: 'We were told he was very poorly and to expect the worst. All of his major organs were shutting down and he was on all sorts of different drugs to keep him alive.

'I thought how am I going to cope with losing a baby?'

After a few weeks, Olly made it home, but because of his condition, his tongue grew unusually large and it led to severe breathing difficulties.

In November 2011, his father Kevin, a chef, had to give his nine-week-old son CPR and the youngster was rushed to hospital for surgery and placed on oxygen.

But during a routine scan in March last year, the family received another devastating blow. Olly had a tumour on his liver and would need to start chemotherapy the next week.

He had the tumour, and a quarter of his liver, removed during a seven-hour operation but he suffered peritonitis, an inflamation of the abdomen wall, straight after.

The odds were stacked against Olly but now he is back at home and learning to walk, however because of the syndrome, medics will need to keep an eye on him for years to come.

Carla said: 'They told us to expect the worst and to say goodbye. But he pulled through.

'I just want to thank the people at the Royal Victoria Infirmary who looked after Olly. We are lucky to have such a brilliant hospital and everyone there has been amazing.'
