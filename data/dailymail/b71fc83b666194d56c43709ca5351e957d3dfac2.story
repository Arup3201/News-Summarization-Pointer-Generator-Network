The Pope has been accused of failing to stand up to the brutal military junta that slaughtered tens of thousands of Argentines in its so-called Dirty War.

Critics say Jorge Mario Bergoglio did little to help those who disappeared when the country was under right-wing military rule – and too much to criticise the left-wing opponents of the generals.

He has even been accused of turning a blind eye to the rounding up and torturing of his own Jesuit priests, something he strongly denies.

The baggage of Argentine history also means potential diplomatic difficulties for Britain over the Falkland Islands.

At a mass in Buenos Aires last year, on the 30th anniversary of the invasion of the Falklands, the Pope referred to the British as ‘usurpers’ and called for the Argentine dead to be thanked.

He said: ‘We come to pray for all who have fallen, sons of the Homeland who went out to defend their mother, the Homeland, and to reclaim what is theirs, that is of the Homeland, and it was usurped.’

‘The Homeland cannot exclude from its memory, anyone who was called; it has to take charge of so many hearts with scars, and say thank you to them, to those who stayed on the island or those submerged in the water, to all of them.’

At another anniversary service in 2008, he referred to those who sought to ‘de-Malvinise history and reality’.

Bergoglio was the rector of an Argentine seminary at the time of the Falklands War in 1982.

However the most damning criticism of the new Pope comes from the Argentine human rights lawyer Myriam Bregman, who has accused him of allowing his own Jesuit priests to be rounded up and tortured by the junta death squads, and of failing to intervene when families begged him to help find babies kidnapped by the regime.

Bergoglio was head of the Jesuits in Argentina in the 1970s as the Dirty War began, first under the ageing Juan Peron and later under the military junta.

Miss Bregman said that church leaders knew what was happening in the Dirty War, yet backed the regime. ‘The dictatorship could not have operated this way without this key support,’ she said.

The Pope has been charged by critics with failure to confront a regime that killed its opponents, including not only left-wing guerillas but thousands of students and others considered ‘politically unacceptable’.

The period became a by-word for brutality, with thousands of families suffering the disappearance of loved ones and the adoption by the armed forces of murder methods such as throwing detainees out of aeroplanes.

One form of torture for families was the kidnapping of babies of mothers murdered as enemies of the regime and their adoption by families approved by the military dictatorship. The bishops of Argentina, led by Bergoglio, published an apology in October last year in which they acknowledged that the church had not protected its faithful.

However the statement still blamed leftists as well as the junta for the killings.

The bishops appealed for information about where bodies had been buried or knew identities of stolen babies to come forward.

However the apology came too late for liberal and left critics.

They point to Bergoglio’s refusal to give evidence in open court on the events of the 1970s until 2010, when his answers were considered evasive by some.

He is also accused of failing to prevent the torture of two of his own Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics, both supporters of left-wing liberations theology who were seized by the regime in 1976.

However supporters of Bergoglio say he took risks behind the scenes, including visiting the home of dictator Jorge Videla to say mass and appeal for mercy.

The two men were released and Bergoglio did not discuss the incident until 2010.

The new Pope is said by supporters to have worked regularly and at some danger to himself to curb the excesses of the military.

Bergoglio is also accused of failing to help a family whose baby was stolen despite appeals to do so from Rome. The family have called his attitude ‘cowardly’.

Estela de la Cuadra, whose family helped launch the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in the final years of the junta, said: ‘He doesn’t face this reality and it doesn’t bother him. The question is how to save his name, save himself. But he can’t keep these allegations from reaching the public. The people know how he is.’

Bergoglio has stood out strongly against the current government of Cristina Fernandez, saying last year that Argentina was suffering from demagoguery, corruption and efforts to re-establish authoritarianism.
