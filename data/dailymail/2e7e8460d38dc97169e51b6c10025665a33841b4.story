The American Meteor Society released this map showing where the fireball was seen - and appealed for anyone who saw it to report the sighting via their website

One witness in Silver Spring, Maryland, said that it 'looked like a plane on fire close by.'

'It was a huge yellow burning tail streaking what seemed right over the city," another poster from Virginia Beach wrote.

'It was angled in a way that it looked like it was going to crash into the city.'

Others described the meteor, which appeared a little after 7 p.m., as white, blue or green.

Other initially mistook it for a flare.

One caller from Fairfax described the fireball as a 'momentary flash following the trail of light, but and bright and blue, which very quickly disappeared.'

A caller in Springdale, said they thought the meteor was a flare or a fireball and that it 'appeared to hit the ground.'

The AMS also plotted exactly which direction people saw the meteor coming from

A similar event happened on Monday evening, viewed by at least 100 people from Maryland north to Connecticut.

The organization says 'several thousand' meteors that could be classified as fireballs enter the atmosphere every day, but most go unseen because they burn up over oceans or uninhabited areas.
