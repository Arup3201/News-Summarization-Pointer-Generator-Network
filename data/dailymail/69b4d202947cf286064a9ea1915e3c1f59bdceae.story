Under pressure: RBS, led by chief executive Stephen Hester, pictured, is set to be hit by a £150m fine over market rigging

Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be 
fined about £150million for participating in market manipulation 
offences similar to those engaged in by Barclays, it has been revealed.

Sources
 said RBS has admitted guilt of offences similar to those committed by 
Barclays' traders, though at RBS they were more isolated and less 
serious.

And today, as more
 revelations trickled out about the unfolding scandal, the bank's chief 
executive Stephen Hester said he will not take a bonus this year 
following problems experienced by the company’s NatWest bank.

The news comes after a sacked RBS trader accused his bank bosses of colluding with staff to rig the financial markets to maximise profits in an explosive set of court documents revealed today.

The
 bank is thought to have accepted that it will probably have to pay 
about half as much as the £291 million in fines imposed on Barclays, 
according to the Times.

Any settlement with the various regulatory authorities is thought to be several months off, the Times said.

Stephen
 Hester, the CEO of RBS, will now face the same tough questions that 
have bombarded his Barclays counterpart Bob Diamond, who has come under 
increasing pressure to resign in the wake of the scandal.

Barclays
 agreed on Wednesday to pay a record $453 million fine to US and British
 regulators for attempting to manipulate the London Interbank Offered 
Rate in 2005-08.

Britain's
 banking woes deepened today as the Financial Services Authority said it
 had settled with four banks - Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Lloyds - after 
finding evidence they mis-sold products to protect small businesses 
against a rise in interest rates.

Compensation
 could run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, lawyers have said, 
although Lloyds said the cost for it would not be material.

The
 FSA said from 2001 to date, banks sold around 28,000 interest rate 
protection products to customers, although it did not did not say how 
much it would cost the banks.

A string of mis-selling cases has 
rocked the financial services industry for over two decades and banks 
are already likely to pay upwards of £9 billion in compensation for 
mis-selling loan insurance.

The Libor mis-selling scandal is 
expected to draw in many banks globally, but Diamond has found himself 
first in the firing line after U.S. and British authorities fined 
Barclays $450 million on Wednesday for manipulating the London interbank
 offer rate (Libor).

Under fire: The Libor mis-selling scandal is expected to draw in many banks globally, but Barclays boss Diamond has found himself first in the firing line

Prime Minister David Cameron said 
Diamond - who was running the investment banking arm Barclays Capital 
when the rigging occurred in 2005-2009 - and other bosses had some 'big 
questions to answer'.

Britain also called in the fraud squad to investigate possible crimes.

'Politicians
 have already been baying for blood and calling for the head of Bob 
Diamond, especially as he was in charge at BarCap at the time,' said 
Stephen Peak, manager of the Henderson UK Alpha and European Absolute 
Return funds and a shareholder in the bank.

'We
 feel that the Barclays board will instinctively wish to resist this, as
 Diamond is clearly the architect and leading light of Barclays, but 
feel that the pressure may be too great.'

Earlier, Tan Chi Min, a former head of delta 
trading for RBS’s global banking and markets division in Singapore, 
alleged that managers at RBS condoned collusion between its staff to set the 
Libor rate artificially high or low to maximise profits.

He
 named five staff members he claims made requests for the Libor rate to 
be altered and three senior managers who he said knew what was going on.

He also says the practice 'was known to other members of [RBS]’s senior management'.

Mr
 Tan, who was eventually sacked for gross misconduct, worked for RBS 
from August 2006 to November 2011and alleges that senior members of 
staff knew about Libor fixing, and that the behaviour started while Fred
 Goodwin was chief executive

During his dismissal case he accused Brevan Howard, one of Europe's largest hedge funds, of asking RBS to change the Libor rate.

He accused the fund of telephoning the bank on in August 2007 asking if they could change the bank's Libor submission.

Investigation: The ex-RBS employee alleges that senior members of staff knew about Libor fixing, and that the behaviour started while Fred Goodwin was chief executive

Banks submit their rates to Thomson 
Reuters which then calculates the Libor rate and distributes it on 
behalf of the British Bankers' Association.

The fund was not named in the court case and was not being sued for any wrongdoing.

Tan alleged that it was in fact common 
practice among senior RBS employees to make requests to the bank's rate 
setters as to the appropriate Libor rate.

In
 the court papers filed in New York as part of a class action, Mr Lin 
also implicates hedge fund bosses who have given thousands of pounds to 
the Conservative Party.

It 
is claimed that hedge fund Brevan Howard asked RBS to fix financial data
 by making false submissions. The fund donated £10,000 to the Tories and
 spent £3,542 on flights for George Osborne to attend a conference in 
2008.

RBS said it was confident of mounting a successful defence against Mr Tan’s claims.
