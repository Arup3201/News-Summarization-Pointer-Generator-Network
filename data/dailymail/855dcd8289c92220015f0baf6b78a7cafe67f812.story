Prince Charles will break with the Queen’s habit of discretion when he becomes King and continue to speak out on issues close to his heart, it was claimed today.

According to an unnamed source quoted in The Guardian, the heir to the throne is ‘ready to reshape the monarch’s role’ when he accedes to the throne. 

The newspaper claimed Charles wants to make ‘heartfelt interventions’ in national life, in stark contrast to his mother who rarely utters a word on matters of public debate – including September’s Scottish referendum.

The Prince frequently speaks his mind, often controversially, on issues that he feels passionately about such as the environment, farming, health, education and architecture.

While some see his interventions as well-meaning, others – including some former ministers – have accused him of meddling. 

Next week the Supreme Court will rule on a legal battle by The Guardian to publish 27 of Charles’s so-called ‘black spider memos’, correspondence sent by the Prince to ministers on a variety of issues affecting public life.

Clarence House, backed by former attorney general Dominic Grieve, has argued that the Prince has a right to express his opinions and for those views to be kept secret in order to protect the monarchy’s political neutrality.

But critics of the Prince say his ‘meddling’ and ‘lobbying’ over national affairs have put him in an invidious position.

Now what the paper describes as a ‘well-placed source’ says of his future role: ‘He will be true to his beliefs and contributions. 

'Rather than a complete reinvention to become a monarch in the mould of his mother, the strategy will be to try and continue with his heartfelt interventions, albeit checking each for tone and content to ensure it does not damage the monarchy.

‘Speeches will have to pass the following test: would it seem odd because the Queen wouldn’t have said it or would it seem dangerous?’

The paper also quotes Patrick Holden, an adviser to the Prince on sustainability, as saying: ‘The Prince understands the need to be careful about how he expresses concerns…but I do think he will keep doing exactly that.’

Clarence House described the claims as ‘speculative’, but a spokesman added: ‘The Prince of Wales cares deeply about this country and has devoted most of his working life to helping individuals and organisations to make a difference for the better.’
