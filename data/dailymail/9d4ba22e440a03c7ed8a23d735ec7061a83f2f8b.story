Paris Saint-Germain have had a new offer for Adnan Januzaj rejected, the Manchester United attacker's agent has claimed.

Januzaj has been used sparingly at Old Trafford this season by Louis van Gaal, despite becoming a rare bright spark for the Dutchman's predecessor, David Moyes.

The Belgian international has found opportunities in the first team hard to come by after Angel di Maria signed from Real Madrid.

And the 19-year-old attacking playmaker has  been repeatedly linked with French champions PSG, who are languishing in third place in Ligue 1 this season and trail leaders Lyon by four points.

'PSG have shown themselves to be interested this winter,' Januzaj's representative Dirk de Vriese told Foot Mercato in France.

'They directly contacted Manchester United for information. Van Gaal announced that he (Januzaj) cannot leave this winter. Not as a permanent transfer nor as a loan. 

'The coach considered him as an important player for (the) squad. He is counting on everyone. It seems like a definitive decision, I don’t think that it can change.'

PSG's manager, the former United defender Laurent Blanc, is a long term admirer of Januzaj's talents.

They had a bid for him rejected before he penned a five-year contract extension with the Premier League side in October 2013.
