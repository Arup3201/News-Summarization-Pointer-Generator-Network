You're likely to be rated as more attractive when pictured in a group than when alone, according to new research.

Being pictured with friends could boost your perceived attractiveness as people tend to 'average out' everyone's facial features when looking at group photos.

Observers perceive each individual's face as
 more average than they would otherwise - and average faces are deemed more attractive. The phenomenon is dubbed the 'cheerleader effect'.

Research suggests those who are thought to look most average and most attractive, due to lack of oddities.

'Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies,' says Drew Walker, a psychological scientist.

He carried out the study alongside Edward Vul of the University of California, San Diego.

Their findings were published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, reported Science Daily.

'Perhaps it's like Tolstoy's families: Beautiful people are all alike, but every unattractive person is unattractive in their own way,' says Walker.

The character Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother first coined the term in an episode of the popular TV show.

He
 said the Cheerleader Effect (Bridesmaid Paradox, Sorority Girl 
Syndrome, and, for a brief window in the mid-90s, the Spice Girls 
Conspiracy) is when women appear 'hot' - but only as a group, not 
individually. If you take each member of that group individually they are in fact, on the contrary, unattractive, as flaws become more obvious.

Walker and Vul set out to find out wheher the attractiveness of average faces, coupled with the tendency to encode groups of objects as an 'ensemble', might support Stinson's theory.

To test this, researchers performed five experiments with over 130 undergraduate students who were shown pictures of 100 people, and asked to rate their attractiveness.

Sometimes the person being rated was in a group portrait with two other people, and other times the pictures were cropped to show the person alone. Overall, participants rated both female and male subjects as more attractive in the group shot than when pictured alone.

Being seen in a group offers an attractiveness benefit roughly enough to bump someone up two per cent.

'The effect is definitely small, but some of us need all the help we can get,' said Vul.

In several other experiments, Walker and Vul discovered that the pictures don't need to be from an organic group portrait to obtain this effect.

Participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of one person out of a collage of 4, 9, and 16 pictures. The 'group' picture was still rated more highly than when that individual's picture was presented alone.

'If the average is more attractive because unattractive idiosyncrasies tend to be averaged out, then individuals with complementary facial features - one person with narrow eyes and one person with wide eyes, for example - would enjoy a greater boost in perceived attractiveness when seen together, as compared to groups composed of individuals who have more similar features,' says Vul.

In the study, 'group' pictures were rated more highly than pictures of individuals presented alone
