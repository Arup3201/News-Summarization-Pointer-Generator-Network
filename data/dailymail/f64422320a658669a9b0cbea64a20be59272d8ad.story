A British woman is being forced to bring up her daughter alone after her medic husband was denied permission to join her in the UK.

Elizabeth Celi Parr met Ramiro Alexander Celi Moreno in his native Ecuador - the couple have been married for two years and had their first child, Olivia, 21 months ago.

But despite his medical training, he has been banned from moving to Britain because the Home Office says the family does not earn enough to support itself.

Family: But Elizabeth Celi Parr and Ramiro Alexander Celi Moreno are currently forced to live separately after he was denied permission to move to Britain to be with his wife and daughter Olivia

Wedding day: The couple were married in 2011 after meeting in Mr Moreno's native country of Ecuador

Ms Parr - the daughter of two Conservative councillors - says that both she and her husband have been offered jobs at the family firm and rent-free accommodation with her parents in Devon.

'I am a British citizen, we are happily married and both very skilled - I never thought for a moment I would not be allowed to come back to live in my own country with my husband,' the 29-year-old said.

'The ridiculous thing about not allowing Alexander to come here, where he could earn good wages, is that I am now a single mother. Were it not for my parents I would probably have to go on benefits.

'We would not be a burden and there is plenty of room here - even with me, my parents and my sister we are rattling around here.

'The Government idea is supposed to be to lessen the burden on taxpayers but it increases it - I cannot understand how these rules are helping anyone.'

Ms Parr met Mr Moreno, 33, in 2006 - ironically, when she was struggling to secure an Ecuadorian visa allowing her to work as an English teacher.

The pair wed in 2011 and lived in Argentina and Chile, but when Olivia was born they decided to settle near Ms Parr's family in Colyton.

They were confident that Mr Moreno's background as an on-call doctor would enable him to secure a well-paid job, while Ms Parr was receiving maternity pay from her previous job at an investment bank.

She was being paid £13,000 - but even though she had substantial savings, the application was refused because she did not meet the £18,600 threshold required by the Home Office in order to ensure that prospective immigrants can support themselves.

A large proportion of British families would fail to meet the income requirement, which is much higher than the minimum wage.

Together: Mr Moreno is not even allowed to visit the UK in case he stays in the country illegally

It was imposed by Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012 as part of Government attempts to reduce net immigration below 100,000 a year by the time of the next election.

However, despite the crackdown which has left families such as Ms Parr's separated, citizens of Romania and Bulgaria will be allowed to come to Britain without any restrictions from January.

In addition, the Government has struggled to deport a number of criminals and anti-British activists such as Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, who both put up legal fights for years before finally being forced to leave the UK.

Ms Parr lodged an appeal against the decision in April, and was told this month that she would have to go to court to contest the visa refusal.

Mr Moreno is not even allowed to apply for a tourist visa to visit his wife and daughter for a short period, because officials say he might attempt to stay in Britain illegally.

Heartbreak: Ms Parr insists the family is able to support itself thanks to her husband's medical training

Playing: Ms Parr is now working at her family firm, a traditional tannery based in Colyton

'Myself and Olivia went over for a holiday in July, but it was a nightmare - I spent 24 hours travelling with a crying baby,' she said.

Ms Parr has now set up a support group for other families in the same situation as her, and has met with the Archbishop of Westminster in a bid to further her cause.

She is working as a project manager for the family business, a leather tannery named J & FJ Baker & Co Ltd which has been owned by her relatives for 150 years and still uses traditional oak bark techniques.

Her father Andrew is chairman of the local parish council, while her mother Helen sits as a Conservative on East Devon district council.

A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Mr Celi Moreno’s application was refused because it did not meet the necessary financial requirements. As there is an appeal outstanding in this case it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'
