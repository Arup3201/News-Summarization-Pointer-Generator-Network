President Obama shocked workers at a New York City Gap store on Tuesday when he made a surprise detour to shop for the women in his life.

Obama's visit came after the retailer's February decision to raise workers' minimum wage, but the president was clear he'd also stopped in to buy a gift.

'I think the ladies will be impressed by my style sense,' Obama joked to the dumbstruck Times Square store staff.

Presidential visit: President Obama stopped into the Times Square Gap store on Tuesday, much to the surprise of store staff

The ladies in his life: Obama looked at several options and said he was t the store in search of a gift for the first lady and his daughters

A hoodie? A worker first suggested a hoodie for Mrs. Obama, but the president was quick to shoot that idea down

Upon his arrival, a worker first suggested a hoodie for Mrs. Obama, but the president said that isn't the first lady's thing.

Instead, he was shown the line of V-neck sweaters in a rainbow of colors, though he gravitated toward the not-so-plunging neck lines.

'I'm worried the V-neck is going to slip,' he quipped.

Eventually the president settled on a black and white stripped sweater, as well as a pink number, for his daughters.

Political purpose:The president was at the Times Square store with the dual purpose of pushing for Congress to increase the minimum wage

'I think the ladies will be impressed by my style sense,' Obama joked to the dumbstruck Times Square store staff.

Stripes! Obama also bought a black and white striped sweater

'Who's going to ring me up?' he asked.

Though
 it wasn't quite so simple. Obama said it was rare that he carried 
around his wallet and wasn't altogether sure how to pay.

'Oh wow, so you can sign the machine?' he said after he swiped.

The president then assured everyone it was a joke. 'They had these around the last time I shopped.'

Then the president got down to business: his push to get Congress to raise the federal minimum wage.

'Who's going to ring me up?': Obama said he wasn't accustomed to doing much shopping these days

Declined: Though he was offered the chance to sign up for a store card, the president turned it down

'He's better looking in person,' said cashier Sonia Del Gatto

Obama took the time to greet the staff and make his pitch for increased minimum wage. 'It's not only good for them and their families, it's also good for the entire economy,' he said. 'I want to congratulate the Gap for doing the right thing.'

He thanked the Gap for taking it upon themselves to raise wages, a move he said will help families across America.

'It's not only good for them and their families, it's also good for the entire economy,' he said. 'I want to congratulate the Gap for doing the right thing.'

The stunned workers seemed flattered with the president's visit to their store. And one returned his compliment in kind.

'He's better looking in person,' said cashier Sonia Del Gatto.

Salesman in Chief? The president has turned pitchman in many ways in recent weeks. He's only just made headlines for a surprise appearance on the edgy web comedy Between Two Ferns in which he sat with actor Zach Galifianakis and made a pitch for Obamacare
