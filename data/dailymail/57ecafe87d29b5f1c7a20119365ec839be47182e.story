Patrick Bamford has been on the Etihad Stadium pitch just once before. He was in the crowd for a Bon Jovi concert.

On Saturday, the Chelsea loanee is out to make himself the headline act when Championship side Middlesbrough take on Manchester City in the fourth round of the FA Cup. One day, though, he hopes to take centre stage, guitar in hand.

For the 21-year-old boasts many talents away from football. Not too many professionals can say that an offer from Harvard University was the back-up plan to a career in the game. And neither are many English players conversational in German and French, with Spanish on the ‘to do list’.

Indeed, Grantham-born Bamford — once a promising rugby union full back — was a straight-A student and took his GCSE and A-Level exams a year early at the prestigious Nottingham High School. But it is music in which he has always excelled. He can play the piano, violin and saxophone and is on the lookout for a Teesside-based guitar tutor. In the meantime, he is teaching himself.

‘Every day after training I play for about an hour, or until my fingers get sore,’ the England Under-21 striker tells Sportsmail as, perhaps unknowingly, he taps his fingers on the desk. ‘I don’t want to p*** off the neighbours too much because the sound-proofing in my flat is awful.

‘But I love it. I just typed “easy songs to learn” into YouTube one day and this American guy — Martyzsongs — popped up. He doesn’t know it, but I spend an hour with him every day.’

In Bamford’s playbook are Oasis, Rod Stewart, Van Morrison and the aforementioned Bon Jovi.

After studying Technology and Design at university, the Russian penned a thesis on a suit that can be used as sportswear.

The former Nottingham Forest trainee — who joined the Blues for £1.5million three years ago — said: ‘When I first signed for Chelsea I went to a charity dinner where I was drawing the raffle. One of the prizes in the auction was Bon Jovi tickets. There didn’t seem to be much interest so I put in a bid of £60 and won — it was brilliant.’

Recognising a bargain ties in with Bamford’s economics A-Level and the offer from Harvard, the American Ivy League university which invited him to study business (and play football) aged 17. He is also shrewd enough to know that the odds are stacked against Boro this afternoon.

‘I think we’ve got a chance, I really do, as long as we stick to our game plan,’ says Bamford, who turned down Harvard in favour of his scholarship at Forest. ‘I saw City against (Sheffield) Wednesday in the last round and they were pushed all the way and I watched Arsenal beat them last weekend.

‘I see it as a one-off chance to prove yourself against top opposition, to express yourself and get your name out there.’

It is at Stamford Bridge, however, where he ultimately hopes to strike the right chord. Jose Mourinho’s former Real Madrid assistant, Aitor Karanka, is in charge at Boro and the Chelsea boss insisted in the summer that Bamford move to the North East. 

Mourinho makes regular checks on his progress and has taken a shine to the erudite and engaging youngster. ‘The first time I met him was with the technical director and my dad,’ Bamford recalls. ‘He walked in and said, “What do you want?” I told him, “To play for Chelsea”.

'I think he liked that. When I left he was very emotional and gave me a hug goodbye and told me to do my best. It meant a lot.’ 

There is, of course, a danger that Bamford will never get to play under Mourinho.

Romelu Lukaku scored 32 Premier League goals over two seasons on loan at West Brom and Everton yet was still offloaded. Bamford has 34 goals during loan stays at League One MK Dons, Derby County and Boro.

But there is something entirely convincing when he tells you he will play for the Blues.

‘I believe so, yes,’ he returns when the question is put to him.

‘Whether it’s next year, or the year after, I believe I will be there.

‘Of course, I will be doing well to displace Diego Costa! But I’d like to think I could maybe go back next season as the third-choice striker and then challenge for the position of second striker. I’ve got full belief in myself.’

There is something reassuringly ruthless about Bamford. He is also smart enough to detach himself from terrace emotion. After all, how many Forest season-ticket holders would sign for Derby?

And then, having scored eight times for the Rams and starred in a 5-0 thrashing of his boyhood team, return to the City Ground as a fan?

The message, then, is clear: when Bamford sets his sights on something – playing for Chelsea, learning the guitar or teaching himself Spanish – nothing will get in his way.

‘I love it here, but at the end of the day it’s a job,’ he says.

‘Sometimes that’s hard with fans – especially last year at Derby with it being a big thing joining them as a Forest fan – then you leave them.

‘I watched Forest quite a bit at the start of the season and the Derby fans hated it, they didn’t seem to appreciate that when I was there it was a job and I did my best professionally.’

For now, he is fully signed up to Middlesbrough’s top-flight bid. 

Last weekend, when Forest beat Boro’s promotion-rivals Derby thanks to Ben Osborn’s late winner in the lunchtime kick-off, Bamford hit the roof.

‘You should have seen my celebration in the changing-room,’ he laughs.

‘I was jumping in the air when Ben scored. I was with him all the way through from 10-year-old at Forest to when I left for Chelsea.

‘I went on the pitch with a smile that day.My friend scored, Forest got a win which they needed, our rivals got beat and we went on to win as well – it was a good day.’

There is still hope, however, that this season will not be his last at the Riverside. At the end of the day, what Jose says, his players do.

‘It’s possible that I could be back next season,’ he admits.

‘If we do get promoted and I have a sit-down with Jose and discuss what is best, then perhaps it might be to come back here for game-time.

‘That could well happen because I honestly think we will win promotion. We have a brilliant togetherness and I don’t think there is a squad as good as us in the Championship.’

On Saturday, though, it is all about the FA Cup.
