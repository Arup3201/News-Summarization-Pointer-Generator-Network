Rent boy Ciaron Dodd who is alleged to have had drug fueled sex with disgraced bank boss Paul Flowers

A male escort allegedly paid for sex by shamed Co-operative Bank chief Paul Flowers is a convicted armed robber who attacked a Co-op store, the Daily Mail can reveal.

Ciaron Dodd, 21, a part-time model and £650-a-night escort, described this week how the Methodist minister showered him with gifts and took him for nights out to the theatre.

However the rent boy did not reveal how as a teenager he was part of a gang which terrorised a string of  convenience stores – including, in an extraordinary irony, a Co-op.

Dodd was sentenced to nine months’ detention when he was 17 for carrying out the raids armed with knives and coshes.

Targets included the Co-op branch  in the Cheshire village of  Grappenhall, with the gang’s eventual haul including £285 in cash and £1,000 worth of cigarettes and scratch cards.

He and six other youths involved in the two-month crime spree appeared before Warrington Crown Court where

Dodd was locked up for nine months at a young offenders’ institution.

Dodd has described how he took part in threesomes with Flowers and another rent boy after taking a  cocktail of substances including cocaine, ketamine and the party  drug GHB.

He has backed up his claim by producing damning messages sent by Flowers, 63, from his work email – in which he organised the drug-fuelled threesomes.

In one, Flowers wrote: ‘Been waiting for you to come and have some  coke (cocaine) and k (Ketamin) with me. P x’

Earlier this week, Dodd said: ‘I knew what he did for a living and couldn’t believe how debauched he was. Every time he saw me he knew he was risking everything – but he just didn’t seem to care.

‘He took me to the theatre and gave me presents like chocolate and wine. I was old enough to be his grandson but he didn’t seem to think we looked like the odd couple.’
