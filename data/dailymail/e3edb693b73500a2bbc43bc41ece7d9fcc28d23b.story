wearer drop a dress size, while being made of machine-washable, 
crease-resistant material.

Bandage-style dresses have attracted a following from celebrities such as 
Gwyneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham and Eva Longoria for their figure-hugging designs.

FEMAIL writer Deni Kirkova put the Body Frock dress to the test, but what did she think?

'I felt snug and sucked in in the black slip. It feels like super firm controlwear with thick, good quality fabric which smooths the silhouette and pushes my boobs up (double thumbs up).

'The lace dress itself was a little less forgiving, a little too much coverage all over and quite long for my liking.

'Though the lace was good quality - you can tell it’s not any old high street dress.

'Definitely worth the money.'
