The new uniforms to be worn by the U.S. snowboarding team may be a patchwork of patriotic red, white and blue, but the designs are not made in the USA.Their uniforms, unveiled by manufacturer Burton Tuesday night, are built around the competition jacket with squares of stars, stripes and plaids.The company is now defending its choice to use foreign labor and fabrics to produce the uniforms, which will be worn in 2014 in Sochi.

Fox News reports that Vermont-based Burton claims it's impossible to produce uniforms of high technical standards without going abroad.

'To achieve this level of performance and function, Burton turned to its best, long-standing and most trusted technical partners around the world to produce the uniforms, to ensure that our high technical and design standards were met,' Burton Snowboards said in materials obtained by Fox News.

'For example, the original quilt was sourced in the U.S. and brought back to Vermont to be deconstructed and reconstructed for jacket fabrication with Vermont-based designers.'

The design was inspired by a handcrafted patchwork quilt spotted at an antiques fair, according to the company. The way the fabric is printed, no two items with the quilt fabric are quite the same.

The uniform includes base-layer henleys, warm-up pants, fleeces and five-pocket corduroy snowpants.

Men and women competitors will wear more or less the same look.

'The vintage quilt and flag print of 
the jacket combined with the corduroy pants give the uniform an 
'heirloom hippie' vibe that lines up with snowboarding's laid-back 
culture while paying respect to America's longstanding creative 
heritage. It will stand out in Sochi for sure,' said Greg Dacyshyn, 
chief creative officer, in a statement.

The
fabric, however, is high-tech with exterior layers of proprietary 
waterproof and breathable laminates developed in conjunction with the 
U.S. Army Natick Research, Development & Engineering Center.

Various
components of the uniforms were made in different places due to the 
specificity of the performance materials, Burton said. For example, the 
fabric was printed in Japan and the corduroy made in Taiwan.

'And finally, the majority of the 
actual snowboards that the Burton athletes will ride in Sochi are being 
handmade in Vermont at Burton Headquarters in Burlington. As a global 
sport, snowboarding knows no borders. We’re proud that we used our best 
vendors from around the world, including our own Craig’s facility in 
Burlington, Vt., to ensure our American riders have the 
highest-performance gear during one of the biggest competitions of their
lives,' the statement concludes, reports Fox News.

Foreign made: Ralph Lauren was criticized for his 2012 Summer Olympic uniform which was made overseas

Uniforms made by Ralph Lauren for U.S. athletes at the 2012 London Summer Olympics were criticized for being made overseas.

Olympic athletes are outfitted during their competitive events by individual, sport-specific manufacturers. This is the third consecutive Olympics that Burton has partnered with the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association.

All American athletes will be wearing matching Fair Isle sweaters and peacoats for the closing ceremony. The opening ceremony outfits have not yet been revealed.

The Sochi Games begin February 7.
