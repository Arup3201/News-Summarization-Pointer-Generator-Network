before a Spanish court.

The
 list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace 
criminals thought to have fled to Spain which was once the destination 
of choice for Britain’s most notorious fugitives.

Now
 the ‘Costa del Crime’ is the worst place to go on the run. Since 
Captura was launched in 2006, 53 out of 63 suspects named in previous 
appeals have been caught and this latest crop has been dubbed the 
‘unlucky 13’.

Crimestoppers 
founder Lord Ashcroft said: ‘There are still a number of dangerous 
criminals who see Spain as a safe haven to hide from their past, but 
with the support of the Spanish and UK public we can bring them to 
justice.’
