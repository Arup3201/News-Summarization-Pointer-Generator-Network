Hull City goalkeeper Steve Harper is a contender for the vacant managerial position at Carlisle United.

The Cumbrians sacked former Republic of Ireland international Graham Kavanagh on Monday following a poor start to the season.

Harper already has his UEFA A coaching licence and is keen to embark on a career in the dugout. 

Stopper: Harper has been a solid goalkeeper over a long career but now wants to go into management

Under contract: The goalkeeper, who spent 10 years at Newcastle, still has nine months on his Hull deal

Gone: Graham Kavanagh was axed from his first managerial position as boss of League Two's Carlisle United

Tigers boss Steve Bruce is aware of Harper’s ambition but the former Newcastle stopper still has nine months to run on his contract at the KC Stadium.

The 39-year-old made 199 appearances for the Magpies before joining Hull last summer.

Kavanagh, meanwhile, was axed in the wake of Saturday’s 5-0 defeat at Cambridge, which left Carlisle third bottom of League Two and with just two points from five games.

A club statement read: ‘Unfortunately results on the field have not reflected that effort and hard work and from the 40 league games last season, following Greg Abbott’s departure, and through the five league games this season there has been an average of one point per game. 

Axed: Kavanagh oversaw three defeats and two draws as Carlisle got off to a poor start in League Two

Carlisle official statement: 'Saturday’s result at Cambridge was a “tipping point” for those concerned'

Gone: Club captain Paul Thirlwell and goalkeeping coach Tony Caig have been placed in temporary charge

‘This resulted in relegation to League 2 in May 2014 and it was felt we were continuing to head in the same direction this season. Saturday’s result at Cambridge was a “tipping point” for those concerned with the running and management of Carlisle United Football Club.’

Club captain Paul Thirlwell and goalkeeping coach Tony Caig have been placed in temporary charge.
