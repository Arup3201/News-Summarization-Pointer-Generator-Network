Talk about sailing too close to the wind!

Charter captain Kevin Johnsen, his dog Boede and friend Aaron Osters were cruising around the Florida Keys in search of lobster when they were confronted by not one, but five enormous waterspouts.

But rather than head back to port, the brave boaters pointed their vessel at the heart of one of the twisters and sailed right through.

Incredible: Charter captain Kevin Johnsen and his friend Aaron Osters were cruising around the Florida Keys when they were confronted with five waterspouts

Phenomenal: Johnsen said the wind was so strong, it completely opened his boat's deck hatches

The pair captured the weather phenomenon six miles north of Marathon in an 11-minute video Johnsen posted on YouTube.

The powerful storm caused torrents of water to hit the camera lens.

'With plenty of lobster in the box, a great opportunity presented itself to film a close encounter with a weather phenomenon,' Johnsen, who has lived in the Keys for more than 20 years, wrote in a post with the clip.Â 

'This is my third time going through a waterspout in a boat, this one a mere 1/6 of the big waterspout from several years back. Fortunately, this time I had a video camera!'

The experienced sailor said he was literally blown away by the close encounter.

'It's a low-pressure system so your ears pop. I mentioned in the video that all my hatches had opened straight 
up in the air,' Johnsen told Bay News 9.

'Fortunately nothing got sucked out of the boat. It's a 
very intense fan, basically.'

'Calculated risk': Johnsen said he has sailed through waterspouts before but has advised other boaters not to take the risk

Blown away: The sailors said it was lucky they weren't sucked into the twister as they sailed through it, describing it as an 'intense fan'

A waterspout looks like a tornado, with a giant whirling cloud suspended beneath a low-lying cloud, dropping to a body of water.

Johnsen said he was lucky his boat wasn't sucked into the powerful twister.

'This not for anybody to try EVER and this is a delicately calculated risk based on dozens of fluid variables that change by the second,' he wrote on his YouTube page.

'Waterspouts are typically short lived F0 rated tornadoes on the water with winds under 72mph.

'This was a likely an F0 waterspout, yet was strong enough to completely open my deck hatches and forcibly move the boat more than I expected.

'The approach was intended to go with the wind at high speed to minimize the effect, yet provide the fullest, safest experience. Again, don't ever do this! If you do, you're gonna need a bigger boat!'
