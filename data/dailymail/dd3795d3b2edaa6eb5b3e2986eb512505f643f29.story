There are few, if any, drawbacks to feeling happy and now a new study has shown that a positive state of mind can boost our brain power.

Researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices complete with football tables, slides and crazy golf are a waste of time, or whether they boost productivity.

The scientists discovered that happy people outperformed their stressed counterparts and were more-efficient employees.

It is well known that good moods can be contagious, but researchers now think that happiness can even spread through the world wide web.

American researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts.

Researchers, from the University of California analysed more than a billion Facebook status updates, among more than 100 million users, and found that positive statements generated similar messages among friends.

And they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones.

The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, examined posts by people in cities where it was raining - known to increase the number of negative posts and reduce the number of positive ones - and the impact this had on the status updates of people in cities where it was not raining.

To make sure there was no ‘topic contagion’ all weather-related status updates were removed from the analysis.

Each additional positive post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts.

A number of modern workplaces now offer staff fun things to do during their lunchbreak.

Google was among the first large firm to incorporate games tables and fun distractions into its offices.

While the company has gone from strength to strength, researchers have wondered if the firm’s 'work hard play hard' work ethic has been part of its success.

‘For more than 30 years, it has been claimed that a way to improve software developers’ productivity and software quality is to focus on people and to provide incentives to make developers satisfied and happy. This claim has rarely been verified in software engineering research,’ the study says.

Now a team of researchers from the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in Italy have proved that Google’s strategy is a good one, after collecting data from 42 computer scientists at the university.

They tested students to investigate how their emotions and moods affected their programming abilities as well as their creativity and problem solving, IT World reported.

‘Among the many skills required for 
software development, developers must possess high analytical 
problem-solving skills and creativity for the software construction 
process,’ the study says.

After
 measuring the emotional states of the students using what psychologists
 call the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience Affect Balance 
(SPANE-B), they tested the creativity of each participant by 
asking them to write captions for photographs, which were scored by a 
panel of judges.

Researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices, exemplified by Google (pictured) which come complete with football tables, slides and crazy golf are a waste of time, or whether they boost productivity. They found that happy software developers write better code

They were then asked to play a game to investigate their problem solving skills and the time they took to solve the puzzle provided a score on their analytical capabilities.

They failed to show that happiness boosted creativity, but they did find that happy software developers were better at problem solving – a skill highly-prized by businesses such as Google.

‘The empirical data supported a difference in the analytical problem-solving skills of software developers regarding their affective states,’ the study says.

‘More specifically, the results suggest that the happiest software developers are more productive in analytical problem solving performance.’

So it seems that it is worth tech companies investing in fun activities for coders at work.
