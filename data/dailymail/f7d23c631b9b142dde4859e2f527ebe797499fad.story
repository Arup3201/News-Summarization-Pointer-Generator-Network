Sir Terry Wogan has been delighting his TOGs (Terry’s Old Geezers/Gals) on Radio 2 for many years

Book now for our Christmas lunch with a galaxy of stars from the worlds of showbusiness and drama. We’re delighted the hugely popular broadcasters Chris Tarrant, Nicholas Parsons and Sir Terry Wogan and the distinguished actress, Sheila Hancock, will entertain us with stories of their lives and books under the benign and witty stewardship of our master of ceremonies, Gyles Brandreth.

Chris Tarrant is a household name, most notably as the frontman for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? A successful DJ on Capital Radio for 17 years with 4,425 shows to his credit, he has also made the popular television shows Extreme Railway Journeys and Chris Tarrant Goes Fishing. His bestselling memoir Dad’s War: Father, Soldier, Hero was serialised in the Daily Mail. Like so many people, Tarrant regrets he didn’t talk more to his father about his wartime experiences and his book is a moving tribute to the parent he wishes he’d known better.

With a long career as an actor and radio personality, Nicholas Parsons CBE is also the much-loved chairman of Just A Minute — the show he has hosted since the first programme went out in December 1967. A razor-sharp quiz show host, his hits include Sale Of The Century, which achieved a record 21 million viewers at its peak in the Seventies. His new book Welcome To Just A Minute! is described by regular contestant Paul Merton as ‘a joyous compendium of facts, fun and stories’.

Sir Terry Wogan has been delighting his TOGs (Terry’s Old Geezers/Gals) on Radio 2 for many years, reaching audiences of over eight million. Often described as ‘a living national treasure’, he has fronted everything from his eponymous television chat show to Children In Need and the Eurovision Song Contest. The author of many books, his latest, The Little Book Of Common Sense, is a must for every Christmas stocking.

Award-winning actress Sheila Hancock CBE is one of Britain’s foremost actresses. She made her West End stage debut in 1958 and went on to work for Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She has made numerous films and has appeared extensively on television in such popular shows as The Rag Trade, Doctor Who and EastEnders.

A gifted writer, her memoir The Two Of Us is a moving account of her life with her husband, the late actor John Thaw. Her debut novel, Miss Carter’s War, has just been published to acclaim. With its echoes of Miss Jean Brodie, one critic described it as ‘a passionately written and compelling portrait of education in post-war Britain’.
