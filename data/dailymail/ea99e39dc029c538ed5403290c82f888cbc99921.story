Cull: Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman announced two test areas will be selected and allowed to slaughter badgers

Animal rights groups have hit out at government plans to allow badger culling.

Plans for the trials in two secret locations were announced today by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman in a bid to try and eradicate Bovine tuberculosis in cattle.

For six-weeks next year marksmen will be licensed to shoot badgers in the two specific areas before experts decide whether the slaughter of 
badgers is rolled out more widely across England.

Mrs Spelman told the Commons that she wished there was an alternative but an oral vaccine for the disease is 'years away' and injections were difficult to administer to wild badgers which needed to be trapped first.

There are approximately 190,000 badgers in England.

The move was condemned by Labour, with one MP saying the thinking behind the move was 'bad science' founded on greed.

Newport West MP Paul Flynn said: 'Shouldn't a clarion call, gone
out from this House today to all the right thinking, compassionate people in
this country to frustrate this cruel and unnecessary slaughter of animals.

'Isn't it right that this is founded on greed and bad
science by the nasty party?'

While Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw agreed saying shooting the countryside creatures would not eradicate Bovine TB.

Speaking in the commons he said: 'Could she be quite clear with the House what level of mortality she expects shooting to achieve, because the very clear advice that we received... was that shooting would not achieve a level of mortality high enough to make any difference to the disease at all.'

'We can't just do nothing': Environment minister Caroline Spelman said her decision hadn't been easy

The two areas have yet to be selected but Mrs Spelman said the culling will lead to a reduction of 16 per cent in bovine TB.

This claim was violently refuted by animal rights groups.

The RSPCA has recorded a version of the 12 days of Christmas showing how 12 furry badgers will be shot, five cows will still be sick and four farmers will still be angry, three MPs still confused and one vaccine still unused after the trial.

Stacey Frier, the charity's senior Parliamentary adviser, said: 'We, and so many others, have been telling the government for years that this cull is not the answer to the problems with bovine TB but they are just not listening.

'We feel like we are banging our heads against a brick wall for ages. So we have decided to sing about our frustrations instead.'

And PETA said the evidence slaughtering badgers would eradicate bovine TB is 'spurious at best.'

A spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'Evidence that a mass slaughter of badgers would reduce levels of TB is spurious at best. The spread of bovine TB is, however, conclusively linked to the movement and intensive rearing of cattle in the meat and dairy industries, which ignore the fact that these sensitive, intelligent animals are subjected to exhaustion, pain, boredom, loneliness and fear.'

But Mrs Spelman refuted the claims, saying this afternoon: 'I know there is great strength of feeling on this issue but I also know that we need to take action now before the TB situation deteriorates even further.’

Nearly 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in England last year alone because of bovine TB, with the cost to the taxpayer set to top £1billion over the next ten years.

The problem is particularly bad in west and south-west England, where nearly a quarter of all cattle farms were affected by the disease during 2010.

Both trials are expected to cost £500,000 in 
each of the designated areas for the pilot. The cost will be split 
between the Home Office and Defra.

At risk: If the scheme rolls out 190,000 badgers could be at risk of being shot, regardless of of they are carrying the disease

Mrs Spelman said the areas are expected to be around 300 sq km, double the minimum area required for licences to be granted.

The Badger Trust said it was 'clearly very disappointed' and would consult lawyers to decide what action could be taken.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic, contagious disease which can affect all animals including dairy cows.

Due to the seriousness of the disease, farmers take great care to minimise the risk of their cows catching it.

Research has shown that one of the major causes of infection in cattle is through contact with infected badgers.

At the moment farmers can only try 
to stop contact between badgers and dairy cows, including 
'badger-proofing' farm buildings and feed stores.

And Humane Society International executive director Mark Jones, himself a vet, said Mrs Spelman's decision appeared to be in 'clear breach' of the Bern Convention and amounted to 'institutionalised cruelty'.

'For Defra to blindly push ahead with a pilot badger slaughter, despite compelling scientific evidence that it will be ineffective, hugely damaging to local populations and cruel, is an absurdly misguided decision,' he said.

'Badgers are supposed to be a protected species so plans to decimate them surely cannot be reconciled with an international convention on wildlife conservation.'

Mrs Spelman said the government were ready for any legal challenges and saying minsters had a 'copper-bottomed approach to it'.

Both trials are expected to be delayed until after the Olympics because of a heavy police presence is thought to be required to protect the public.

A report by the Farm Crisis Network had 
found there were feelings of 'panic, stress and emotional devastation' 
for farmers and their families as they repeatedly had to send cattle to 
slaughter, she told the Commons.

Farmers want to see a policy to control badgers to tackle a problem they say is one of the greatest threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers

'In the meantime we cannot just do nothing,' Mrs Spelman added. 'This terrible disease is getting worse and we have got to deal with the devastating impact it has on farmers and rural communities.

National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall said: 'Today is another massive step forward in achieving our end goal of a healthy countryside - both for badgers and for cattle.

'I commend Defra for introducing these two pilot areas to confirm the effectiveness, humaneness and safety of controlled shooting.

'We must tackle this terrible disease, a disease that sees tens of thousands of cattle destroyed each and every year. The most recent science shows badger controls are absolutely necessary, together with cattle controls, to get on top of TB.

'No other country in the world has successfully tackled this devastating disease without first addressing the reservoir of TB in the wildlife.'

'I think we would all agree that we need to stop the disease spreading further, to bring it under control and ultimately eradicate it. Evidence tells us that unless we tackle the disease in badgers, we will never eradicate it in cattle.

'No country in the world that has TB in its wildlife has been able to eradicate it in cattle without addressing it in the wildlife population.'

'Nevertheless, we still see a useful role for vaccination, particularly in the future.'

She
said badger control licences would be issued by Natural England to 
farmers and landowners under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 to carry
out culling at their own expense.

Applicants will have to meet strict 
conditions to ensure the culling is carried out safely and humanely, 
with each licence covering a minimum area of 150 sq km over at least 
four years.

The farming 
industry will be invited to come forward with a selection of two areas 
for the pilot and then they will be able to apply for a licence.
