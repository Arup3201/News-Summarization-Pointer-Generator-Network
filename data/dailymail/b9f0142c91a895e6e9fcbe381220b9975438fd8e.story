A strong earthquake struck a ski resort that hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics, flattening homes and injuring more than 22 people.

The magnitude-6.8 earthquake rocked a mountainous area of central Japan near Nagano city shortly after 10pm on Saturday, leaving three people with serious injuries.

It struck at a depth of six miles and destroyed at least 10 homes at the Hakuba ski resort, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. 

At least 21 people were trapped underneath collapsed houses, but they all were rescued by police, with two of them suffering injuries.

A strong earthquake struck Hakuba ski resort near Nagano city in central Japan on Saturday night 

The magnitude-6.8 earthquake destroyed at least 10 homes in the resort and caused travel disruption 

This came just hours after a deadly earthquake rocked southwestern China late Saturday afternoon, killing at least one woman.

The US Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 6.2 in Japan, but since it occurred inland, there should be the no possibility of a tsunami.

Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority said no abnormalities were reported at three nuclear power plants in the affected areas.

All of Japan's nuclear plants are offline following a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and massive tsunami in 2011 that sent three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant into meltdown.

Fukushima is about 155 miles northeast of where Saturday's earthquake occurred.

'We are trying to assess the situation as quickly as possible, and we'll do our utmost for the rescue of the injured people,' Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters.

One of the hardest-hit areas was ski town  Hakuba, as at least 10 homes collapsed there, according to Shigeharu Fujimura, a Nagano prefecture disaster management official. 

Many houses also lost water because of a ruptured pipe and landslides on two major roads blocked access to some areas.

Cracks appeared on major roads and landslides blocked several busy routes in the mountainous area

The impact was felt across much of northern Japan and in Tokyo, around 125 miles southeast of Hakuba

'We are afraid there could be some areas that may have been isolated, so we need to conduct a thorough assessment of damage after sunrise,' Fujimura said.

Ryo Nishino, a restaurant owner in Hakuba, told Japanese broadcaster NHK that he had 'never experienced a quake that shook so hard. The sideways shaking was enormous.' 

He was in the restaurant's wine cellar when the earthquake struck.

It was felt across much of northern Japan and in Tokyo, around 125 miles southeast of Hakuba.

All shinkansen bullet train systems in the region were temporarily suspended and the quake caused scattered blackouts, including about 1,600 homes in Hakuba and Omachi city. 

The earthquake was followed by 21 aftershocks, said Yohei Hasegawa of the Meteorological Agency's earthquake and tsunami division. 

He warned of further aftershocks and urged residents to watch out for landslides.
