Lager drinkers find it difficult to taste the difference between big name beer brands, blind testing has revealed

Lager drinkers find it difficult to taste the difference between big name beer brands, blind testing has revealed.

A number of European pale lagers were used with volunteers given blind samples of Budvar, Heineken and Stella Artois to see if they could tell them apart.

Researchers found that those taking part could not distinguish between the varieties when two of the samples were the same product and the other one was different. 

Nearly 140 volunteers aged 21 to 70 were given three blind samples of European lager. 

Two of the samples were the same product and one was different. After tasting all of them, each volunteer was asked to select the one that was different from the other two.

Researchers claimed that this revealed customer loyalty to certain brands of beer was the result of marketing rather than taste. 

Tests were carried out by Johan Almenberg and his wife Anna Dreber, of the Stockholm School of Economics, and Robin Goldstein, author of 'The Beer Trials' and the upcoming book 'Blind Taste'.

Mr Goldstein said: 'I think basically what we're looking at is a commodity industry - the products are interchangeable.

'It also means that the beer industry has perfected pale lager beer, which is my favorite style of beer.

Global brewers such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, which makes Budweiser and Stella Artois, and Heineken have taken the world's most widely consumed style of beer, a brew that has been around since the 1500s and perfected it, according to Mr Goldstein.

'They have a good product, a good manufacturing method and it can be sold at a good price,' he added.

'So if you're in a bar and they don't have the lager you usually drink, have a different one. They will pretty taste much the same.'

Sean Lewis, author of the book 'We Make Beer,' which will be published next month, said the finding was good news for beer lovers.

'It means they (the global brewers) are probably doing their jobs right if they all taste the same. They're aiming for a specific flavor profile and they've got it down at this point.'

But although the taste has been perfected, the big beer companies have seen their sales go flat, or even decline, over the last few years in the United States. Last year in Germany beer sales slumped to a 25-year low.

Meanwhile, sales of craft beers have continued to rise and are estimated to reach £12billion in 2014, according to the research firm Mintel.
