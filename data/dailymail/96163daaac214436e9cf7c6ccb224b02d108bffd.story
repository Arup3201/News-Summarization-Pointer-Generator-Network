Real Madrid's training session saw Martin Odegaard swing in a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo to score a header ahead of the 16-year-old's potential debut in the Champions League this week.

Odegaard joined Real in January after the La Liga giants won the race to sign the Norwegian starlet, and he has tried to show manager Carlo Ancelotti why he deserves to face Schalke on Tuesday.

The Norway international has already scored for Real Madrid's B team Castilla and reports suggest he could be in line to make the step up to the first team.

Real's Champions League last-16 tie sees them carry a healthy 2-0 lead from the Veltins-Arena in Germany to Madrid as they look to defend their crown.

And should Odegaard make his debut then he would become the youngest player to play in the Champions League - beating the record of 16 years and 87 days held by former Chelsea and Newcastle man Celestine Babayaro by three days.

Yet before that Real have a La Liga match against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday to deal with.

Real were held to a 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu by Villarreal in their last match, allowing Barcelona to cut the gap to just two points, and can not afford another slip.
