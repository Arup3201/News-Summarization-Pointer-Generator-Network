A woman wing walker and her pilot were confirmed dead after their plane crashed in a ball of flames at an airshow Saturday afternoon.

Jane Wicker, a mother of two sons, was atop the biplane at the Vectren Air Show near Dayton, Ohio when it plunged to the ground in front of horrified onlookers. The pilot, Charlie Schwenker, also perished in the crash.

Witnesses reported hearing screams as the plane dived to the
ground.

'All of a sudden I heard screaming and looked up and there was a fire ball,” Stan Thayer of Wilmington told the Dayton Daily News.

Shawn Warwick was also at the event and watching the crash through binoculars.

“I noticed it was upside down really close to the ground. She was sitting on the bottom of the plane,” he said. “I saw it just go right into the ground and explode.”

Terrence Slaybaugh, the director of 
aviation for Dayton, confirmed their deaths around 2 p.m. The crash 
occurred at around 12:45 p.m.

The air show was cancelled for the rest of the day, and tomorrow's activities have been cancelled as well.

Wicker was well-known as a wing walker after being introduced
to the daredevil activity through a Flying Circus ride she received as a birthday present.

Tragically, a picture on Facebook seems to indicate that she had recently become engaged.

Lives saved: Wicker's pilot, Charlie Schwenker, also perished in the crash, but not before one witness said he steered the plane away from spectators, possibly saving lives

Mother: Wicker was the mother of two sons. She met her now ex-husband through flying and for a while he was her pilot until the marriage dissolved

According to her 
website, Jane was a full-time budget-analyst at the FAA, a freelance 
writer and had recently returned to school to earn a degree in finance.

She
 first got interested in aviation after taking a ride with a friend in 
1988. After her first flying lesson she was hooked and continued to pay 
for all of her flying lessons until she received her pilot's certificate
 in 1989.

Wicker went on to get her several other pilot's ratings, all while working full-time.

For
 a birthday present in 1989, she was gifted with an aerobatic plane ride.
 She loved it and a year later applied to be a wing walker after seeing a
 classified ad in the Washington Post.

The first time she walked on a wing was also her first air show.

Wicker
 met her now ex-husband Kirk Wicker at a wing-walking audition. Jane and Kirk 
joined up and they created 'Beauty and the Beast Wing Walking' together.
 She would walk on the wings while Kirk would fly the plane. When their 
marriage dissolved in 2002, Wicker took a break from wing walking. The couple had two sons, one of which - Ben Wicker - just recently graduated high school.

She got back into wing walking in 2009 when she bought a new plane, Aurora, and re-entered the Airshow Circuit.
