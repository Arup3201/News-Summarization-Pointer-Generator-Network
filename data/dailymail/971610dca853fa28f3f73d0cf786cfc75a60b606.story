You've always got to support your friends in life and last night was no exception - Binky Felstead, who is on the Made In Chelsea E4 TV show with me, had her book launch at top London nightclub Whisky Mist just off Park Lane.

She's hugely popular on the show - and after over three years on MIC together we still get on really well (probably because she's always been sensible enough not to get romantically involved with me.)

There were several of the cast in attendance, as well as friends, family, and the publishing team from Simon & Schuster to help celebrate the launch of Being Binky - 165 pages of the life and times (so far) of Alexandra 'Binky' Felstead.

Last night Spencer joined Binky for the launch of her book - Being Binky

It's been a lot of hard work and effort from Binks - and the finished autobiography looks totes amaze.

A lilac-coloured tome all about her life and loves, some great pictures of her growing up, plus some handy older-sister type hints on how to get through girl's issues (boys, bullies, parents, make-up etc) - it will soon be on bookshelves (this Thursday 8th May).

I'm told there's quite a bit about me in the book - all glowing reports, I'm sure.

Poor old Binky had a bit of bad luck with the traffic coming from filming out all the way from Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire, and so was quite a bit more than fashionably late.

But she looked utterly gorgeous in a rather expensive Joseph jacket when she arrived so she was immediately forgiven.

Binky's first book will give 'big sister advice' on boys, bullies and beauty

I rocked up with Chelsea bad-boy Hugo Empson who runs the Grand Tour luxury motor event and the party started in earnest.

Ciroc vodka was flowing, but Binky was being good only had the one Skinny Bitch (single vodka, lime and fresh soda) because she is currently in full work-out mode and using Forza Raspberry K2 supplements to get in incredible shape.

She has a big lingerie photo-shoot for Bluebella later this week and wants to look her best, but we more than made up for her abstinence on the drink front.

Of course Mummy Felstead was there to witness her daughter's proud moment

Spencer and singer Stacey Jackson wore matching leopard print accessories to the launch

Top diamond jeweller Vashi Dominguez was invited because he's loaning jewellery from his company Vashi.com for Binky's photo shoot, and he offered to make me a three-carat engagement ring - but it's unlikely I'll need one of those for at least 10 years.

I had a good chat with Binky's mum Jane before Binks arrived - we always get on famously, I think partly because she knows that her daughter has got far too much sense than to get involved with a reprobate like me.

Also at the party was Ollie Locke and Rosie Fortescue, looking immaculate as always - but surprisingly Rosie was wearing high street - as opposed to Bond Street- H&M skirt, Topshop top, Kooples cape (admittedly those aren't cheap), and some gorgeous Steve Madden shoes.

Binky seemed to be getting along famously with latest MIC cast member Emma Miller (left) and her friend Victoria Gucci (right)

On the subject of shoes and accessories, leopard print is in. Well according to singer Stacey Jackson and yours truly.

We were both rocking a pair of racy print footwear and we threw some shapes when the DJ played her latest single Dance the Night Away which Binky appears in the video for.

It's always a pleasant surprise to see the gorgeous Emma Miller and she wore a revealing backless dress with a buckle choker, and she was accompanied by Victoria Gucci who was showing a tasteful glimpse of décolleté.

All the book-worms left and were on their way home to bed by 10pm, and so we thought it was best to take Emma and her friend Victoria and find an after-party to go.

All the best, Spencer.
