A man doubled his trouble by acting out in court after being convicted of domestic violence charges.

Ernest Burch, who was in court for violating terms of a restraining order against his girlfriend, went into a rampage after Broward County judge Geoffrey Cohen said the Fort Lauderdale man was guilty.

He tried to kiss his girlfriend, but was pulled away by a court officer, which spurred more than a minute of chaos before he was finally subdued by two attorneys and bailiffs.

Burch had violated a no-contact order in place with his girlfriend, WSVN reported, and was ordered to be taken into custody.

But just as Deputy Gerald Crowther tried to handcuff him, Burch lashed out and struggled against the cuffs, CBS Miami reported.

Burch reportedly became angry when bailiffs wouldn't let him kiss his girlfriend as he was being taken away. 

A complaint affidavit states that Burch pushed a bailiff who was trying to place handcuffs on him. Seeing Mr Crowther struggling against Burch, two attorneys rushed to his aid.

The courtroom violence was all caught on camera.

Assistant State Attorney Andrew Newman told NBC Miami that he saw trouble brewing when Judge Cohen ordered Burch away.

‘I could see that the judge was getting ready to revoke his bond,’ he said.

'I like to watch their hands because if they’re going to resist, you can see it right when the deputies go to take their hands from behind.’

The video shows Burch struggling to get away even after he was tackled in a corner of the court room.

‘He tried to make a break for it,’ attorney Nirav Jamindar told CBS Miami. ‘Unfortunately, he was out of luck, because we got him.’

He is currently being held in Fort Lauderdale’s Main Jail, the Broward Sheriff’s Office said.
