Authorities said Sunday that a 37-year-old woman was shot to death in her San Francisco Bay Area apartment last week following a visit to a Sikh temple.

Victim Randhir Kaur was a University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Dentistry student.

The Albany Police Department said authorities think Kaur was murdered sometime after returning to her 1068 Kains Avenue apartment on March 8.

Victim: Radhir Kaur was shot to death in her San Francisco Bay Area apartment last week following a visit to a Sikh temple, according to authorities 

Police said Kaur earlier was at Sikh temple Gurdwara Sahib for afternoon prayers and was going to study that night.

University officials grew worried about Kaur's well-being on March 9, and reached out to one of her relatives, who discovered Kaur's body that day, police said.

Last week, authorities said the dental student's body was found around 4pm.

'Responding officers found Kaur lying on the floor of her apartment and her car, a brown 1999 Toyota, was found parked and locked at her residence,' the Albany Police Department said in the Sunday news release.

It continued 'Also on Monday, personal items belonging to Kaur were found inside a trash receptacle in the 5200 block of Panama Street in the city of Richmond. These items appear to have been moved from the crime scene.'

Discovery: Elizabeth Duke, pictured, lives in Richmond and found Kaur's purse as well as a bag containing bloody clothes in her trash can on Monday

Richmond resident Elizabeth Duke, who found the items March 9, said in an interview with KTVU 'The blood was, you know, frightening.'

The items, the television station reported, included Kaur's Coach purse, ID, credit cards, wallet, and an empty Bank of America envelope. No cash was recovered, according to KTVU.

'Right below the purse was a bag full of bloody clothes,' Duke said.

KTVU reported that Duke reached out to police in Albany first, but authorities thought it was a property crime and said to contact police in her city of residence.

Authorities later went to Duke's house after the discovery of Kaur's body was made, according to the Fox affiliate.

The Albany Police Department said in the Sunday news release that there are no suspects and no one has been arrested.

On March 11, the UCSF School of Dentistry announced that a candlelight vigil will be held on March 16 from 5pm to 7pm.

A statement from the school said 'The UCSF School of Dentistry community has suffered a great loss, with the tragic passing of Randhir Kaur. Randhir was a beloved friend, student and colleague, and she will be deeply missed

KTVU reported that post-spring break, a memorial is planned for Kaur. According to the television station, Kaur's graduation would have occurred in June 2016.
