Wilfried Bony believes Swansea will sell him 'for the right price' and not stand in the way of his dream to play in the Champions League after intense interest in the summer came to nothing.

The striker was linked with the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in the summer after a stand-out 2013-14 campaign but despite strong interest after his 27-goal season he remains at the Liberty.

While insisting he is happy in the south of Wales, and reports that he is close to signing at least a one-year extension to his contract taking him up to 2018 at the club, Bony is open to a move.

Wilfried Bony says while he's loving life at Swansea the club will sell him if they can get the right fee

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I am always honest with the club and they are always honest with me. If they get the right price for me I think they will sell. I'm sure the fans will understand.'

Bony scored in the Premier League, Europa League, League and FA Cups for the Swans, and twice for Ivory Coast at the World Cup, but the absence of the Champions League on that list is a frustration he is not shy of noting. 

'For sure, I want to play in that,' he  as Swansea prepare to host one of his potential suitors, Arsenal.

Bony, shoots under pressure from Everton's Gareth Barry, has four goals from 12 appearances this season 

'Yes, one day I would love to play in the Champions League. That is what I am fighting for in my career.'

On the summer speculation Bony says he had to remain professional and focussed on his job at Swansea, and wait to see how things played out. 

And after no deal eventuated he pledged his allegiance to his club.  

'I love it here at Swansea,' he says. 'If you score goals, always the bigger teams will look at you. What I want to do now is to do better than last season.'

Bony hasn't managed last year's form to date for Garry Monk's seventh-placed side, with just four goals in 12 appearances this season, including a double against Leicester last month. 

It took until his eighth match of the campaign to open his account with the 17th-minute opener in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle.

Given their 17-year run in the top flight of European competition, Arsenal would have be an attractive option for the Ivorian before the arrival of in-form Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck from Manchester United. 

Bony scored when the sides last met in March for a 2-2 draw.
