It is the spine-tingling and teeth-chattering challenge that has swept the world and raised millions for good causes.

At the moment, it seems no visit to YouTube or a news website is complete without watching the latest nominated celebrity have freezing cold water poured over them from a big bucket.

But where did this craze come from? And what's it in aid of?

What is the 'Ice Bucket Challenge'?

The choice is very simple. You either stand or sit there while some very kind and willing assistants pour a big container of ice water over your head, or you make a donation to an ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) charity.

The whole thing is filmed and once the 'victim' has recovered from the icy shock, they nominate someone else to take the challenge.

Dunked! David Beckham also took part in the spine-tingling challenge this week. So far, millions of pounds have been raised for good causes as a result of the challenge going viral on social media like Twitter and YouTube

Once nominated, the person has 24 hours to do the same thing and post the evidence on social media like Twitter, Facebook or YouTube to prove they've gone through with it.

Most celebrities have gone through with the challenge but some, like Charlie Sheen, have chosen to donate money instead.

Twist: Charlie Sheen decided to donate to charity rather than subject himself to the cold water

What is ALS?

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the term used in the United States to describe Motor Neurone Disease (MND), which affects a person's ability to move voluntarily.

While the person continues to think and feel, they are often unable to walk, eat or talk, leaving them effectively 'locked in' to their body.

It is estimated about 5,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from MND and half of those diagnosed will die within the first 14 months of knowing they have it.

There is no known cure at present.

How did the craze start?

In the States, when Chris Kennedy, a golfer from Sarasota in Florida, was nominated by a friend to participate in an ice bucket challenge similar to the one screened live on-air by programme Golf Channel Morning.

Kennedy was the first to associate the challenge with ALS because he has a relative suffering from the disease and his video was posted back on July 15.

Soon his friends were all doing it and using the hashtag #StrikeOutALS and it started to go viral when former professional baseball player Pete Frates took part.

By the end of July, the ALS Association reported a dramatic rise in donations and the campaign has been gaining more and more popularity ever since.

What impact is the campaign having?

A very positive one. The ALS Association has seen a huge rise in donations - £9.4m compared with £30,000 in the same period last year - since the campaign went viral.

The Motor Neurone Disease Association reported on Tuesday that is had raised £4,000 from text message donations since the campaign took off in the UK.

Smaller associated charities have also reported a surge in donations.

Who has taken part?

Celebrities the world over have volunteered to have the ice water thrown over them.

Footballers including Neymar, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and John Terry have taken part, as have sports stars Usain Bolt, Tiger Woods, Kobe Bryant and Rory McIlroy to name but a few.

Among other famous folk to have taken part are Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Bieber.

Many have injected an element of humour into their 'dunkings', helping rack up millions of views on YouTube and other sites. 

Thousands of ordinary people have also done their bit, including the 200 who met in Boston's Copley Sqaure to dump water on each other on August 7.
