Seven members of the Red Cross have been kidnapped by gunmen in Syria today.

The six workers and one volunteer were travelling in a four-vehicle convoy in the north of the country when the attackers blocked their path and opened fire, according to Syria state media.

They had been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province when the abduction took place near the town of Saraqeb, at around 11.30am local time.

Help: The people, who have not been identified, has been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province in northern Syria

Treatment: A spokesman has called for the immediate release of the workers, saying they are urgently needed to help the people of Syria

The Syrian media reports blamed the attack on 'terrorists' - a term often used to describe the rebels fighting President Bashar Assad. The Idlib area has been largely under rebel control for the past year.

A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross today confirmed that the people had been kidnapped, but that they had not been contacted by anybody claiming responsibility. The organisation has called for their immediate release.

Ewan Watson said: 'I am able to confirm that six ICRC staff
members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer have been abducted 
near Idlib in northwestern Syria.

'We
are calling for their immediate and unconditional release of this team 
which was delivering humanitarian assistance to those most in need - and
we do that on both sides of the front lines.'

The Red Cross has not offered any information about the gender of nationality of the six employees who were captured.

However, a spokesman said that the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation in the area and to look at how to provide medical aid in the province, which is said to be: 'by definition is a difficult area to go in.'

News of the kidnapping came as further
violence erupted in the Syrian capital, Damascus, where state media 
also reported that its own headquarters in the city's Umayyad Square were damaged by two car bombs.

It is not known whether there are any casualties.

Kidnappings
have become a common feature of the ongoing conflict in northern Syria,
where fighting between government and rebel soldiers is still fierce. 
Aid workers and foreign journalists are at particular risk of abduction.

The
war, which has torn apart the Middle-Eastern country, has so far 
claimed more than 100,000 lives and has created 2.1million refugees.

Ravaged: Areas all over the country have been affected by the conflict

It has been a conflict of particular brutality, with the international Human Rights Watch organisation last week accusing rebel forces of killing 190 civilians and taking 200 hostages in a single attack earlier this year.

People around the world were particularly horrified by reports of a chemical weapons attack in August which killed an estimated 1,400 people.

Following international pressure, a team of inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were sent into the country to oversee the destruction of the Syrian government's chemical weapon supply.

Inspection: Footage allegedly showing the OPCW working in Syria was aired last week

Unknown: The broadcast, from Syrian TV, shows the inspectors at an unspecified location in Syria

The team, which was this week awarded the Nobel peace prize for their work, entered the country at the beginning of the month, and was reportedly filmed starting work on President Assad's stockpiled munitions.

The conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and driven more than 2.1million refugees out of their shattered homeland.
