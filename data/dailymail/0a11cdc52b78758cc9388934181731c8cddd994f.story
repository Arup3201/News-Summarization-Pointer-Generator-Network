Paul Pogba may be one of the most coveted players in world football, but there might not be as much interest in copying his style in clothing.

The France midfielder, who won the 'Best Young Player' award at the World Cup, was snapped in New York's trendy Soho district wearing a vivid tank-top and big shades.

True to form, the 21-year-old Juventus star also sported his trademark hairdo featuring a stripe of bleached blond.

Former Manchester United youngster Pogba, who was spotted in London earlier this month, has been linked with a move back to the Premier League, with Chelsea previously eyeing up a £60million bid.

He will return to Juve's pre-season training under a new boss, with Massimiliano Allegri taking over from the departed Antonio Conte.

The star's agent Mino Raiola quashed talk of a move by telling Tuttosport last week: 'Everything is perfect at Juventus and no meetings are planned.'

'Paul to Chelsea? It’s just fantasy football.'
