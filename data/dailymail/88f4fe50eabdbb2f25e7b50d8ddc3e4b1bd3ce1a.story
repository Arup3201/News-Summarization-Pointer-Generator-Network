The mother of a 27-year-old Mississippi woman found dead on Thursday has released their final text messages to one another.

Tammy Thomas shared with WJTV her text message exchange with slain daughter - and young mother - Courtney Cooke.

Victim: Courtney Cooke, pictured, texted her mother she was on her way home - but was found dead inside a car hours later

'I'm on my way kiss ivy for ne. Ivy' Rae [sic],' Cooke wrote.

Ivy Rae is her one-year-old daughter, the station reports.

Thomas texted her daughter 'Ivy waiting on you' at 12:06am, and later wrote 'Ivy still waiting up' after Cooke said she'd be coming home.

Cooke's body was found inside a car off a highway on Thursday morning with multiple gunshot wounds, an earlier report from WJTV said.

A convenience store employee, Cooke was remembered by its co-owner Boyd Burns, who spoke to WJTV.

'She was like a daughter to me and my wife and the coworkers here,' he said. 'Just - it was devastating to us, something you just don't want to believe. Courtney was a great mom, a great person. she loved to work, she loved the store. She always smiled and did a great job.'

Cooke's other relatives spoke to WHLT.

'I can still remember this beautiful smile that she carried,' her cousin Reginald Warnsley told the affiliate station.

'Not a day that went by that I did not talk to my sister - I talked to her on the day of her death. I don't understand why somebody would do that to her,' her sister Markitta Scott told WHLT.

Sheriff Greg Waggoner told WJTV there is a person of interest.
