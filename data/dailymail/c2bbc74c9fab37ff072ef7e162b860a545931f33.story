Twenty UberX taxi drivers are facing prosecution for using their own cars to pick-up regular passengers.

The drivers are facing fines of up to $110,000 each per offence for breaching the Passenger Transport Act. 

Despite being served with 77 court attendance notices, the popular app service, which is used by thousands of Australians, has told drivers who are fined that it will cover their penalties.

Twenty UberX taxi drivers are facing prosecution for using their own cars to pick-up regular passengers

NSW law states that the taxi service is required to be run through a licensed operator, meaning it is prohibited for the drivers to use their personal cars for the service. 

'We don't believe anyone should be penalised for providing safe, reliable rides in their cities and, as always, we stand by our partners fully,' an Uber spokeswoman told Fairfax media on Monday.

The app-based car service recently called on the NSW government to implement the 'illegal' ride-sharing platform in a bid to make it a permanent transportation option.

It pledged to create thousands of jobs for drivers, and customers who use their ride-sharing service..

The submission by the company to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal review said it's services provide a 'safe, reliable and affordable choices for consumers' as well as offering job opportunities to areas of high unemployment rates in Sydney.

'When comparing the areas Uber partners live and the unemployment rate in certain regions, it is clear they come from those areas where unemployment and under-employment are high,' the company said.

'Uber is helping to provide flexible economic opportunities for people who have previously not had access.

'In New South Wales Uber does not accept any partner that has any Australian criminal history recorded with CrimTrac or who has had their license suspended or has any record of a drink or drug driving record in NSW.'

But a Transport for NSW spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that it is illegal for drivers in NSW to participate in 'ride-sharing' activities like UberX. 

'While Uber Pty Ltd does not breach the Passenger Transport Act 1990 by offering the service, drivers transporting passengers for a fare do,' the Transport for NSW spokesperson said.

NSW law states that the taxi service is required to be run through a licensed operator, meaning it is prohibited for the drivers to use their personal cars for the service

'Any driver operating in these circumstances are potentially committing a number of offences, including driving without authority and offering a service without accreditation.

A submission, which was made in January, said NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian had refused to meet with representatives of Uber. 

An Uber spokeswoman has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that the company is in 'constructive dialogue' with the government and 'have now met with Minister Berejiklian' but could not comment further on the matter.

Uber's director of public policy Oceania Brad Kitschke wrote in the submission that '100 percent of partner drivers who passed Uber's background checks were subsequently able to obtain government authority from the Roads and Maritime Service'.
