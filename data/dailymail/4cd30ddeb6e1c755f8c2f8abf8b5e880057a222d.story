Google unveiled a new 'Account Activity' page this week which sums up who you've emailed, what devices you've used to access Google - and even where you've been.

It's an alarming insight into how much information a signed-in Google user actually hands to the company - with the report offering a summary of what machines you use, who you email most, and even your location via Google Latitude.

The report even tells you 'how you spend your time per week' based on location information gleaned from GPS signals.

The new Account Activity page is a weekly report which sums up what machines you've used to access Google, where you've been, how many emails you've sent and even your web history

'We want Google to work so well, it just blends into your life,' said a post on the official Google blog this week.

'Today we’re introducing Account Activity, a new feature in your Google Account. If you sign up, each month we’ll send you a link to a password-protected report with insights into your signed-in use of Google services,' said the Google blog.

The blog breaks down percentages for how much email you're sending month by month, and which machines have been used to access your account.

Google hopes this feature will add an extra layer of security.

'Knowing more about your own account activity also can help you take steps to protect your Google Account. For example, if you notice sign-ins from countries where you haven’t been or devices you’ve never owned, you can change your password immediately and sign up for the extra level of security provided by 2-step verification,' says Google.

The move comes in the wake of Google's 
controversial new 'privacy policy', which allowed the search giant to 
'pool' information from 60 separate services including Gmail, Google 
Search and Android phones, to create 'personalised' advertising.
  
Google ignored an international outcry to launch its new privacy policy 
on March 1 this year, despite concerns it may be illegal in the EU, as 
well as countries such as Japan and South Korea.
