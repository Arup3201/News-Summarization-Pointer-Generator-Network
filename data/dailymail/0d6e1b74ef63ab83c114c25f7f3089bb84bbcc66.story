The woman had been using social media to sell her daughter for sex, according to police. She would send nude pictures of her daughter to men she met online and in exchange, the men would send photos back along with money, The Missourian reported. 

The mother would also invite some of the men to her trailer home off Highway 8 in Steelville, Missouri to have sex with the middle-school-aged girl. 

The woman's sadistic sex operation was outed when teachers found sleeping pills in her daughter's backpack at school, according to KMOV.

When asked where she got them, the girl said her mother had given them to her.

The 11-year-old's grandfather says he's appalled and disgusted by the charges

The mother apprently admitted to police that she gave the pills to her daughter. She also allegedly admitted to selling nude photos of the girl and allowing men to have sex with her. 

If convicted, the mother could get 14 years in prison. 

The girl's grandfather says he's glad the mother is locked up. 

'She's right where she belongs,' he said, adding that he hopes the men involved are also apprehended. 'I hope they get him too and I hope he’s sitting beside her and I hope they are both in there for awhile.'
