As Brazil prepare to take on Germany in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday evening, they do so deprived of the services of their talisman Neymar and shorn of the attacking spark so readily associated with the country’s brand of football.

In Neymar,'s absence the burden passes to the underwhelming Fred, notable only for his Anglicised name and the increasingly exasperating Hulk.

It begs the question as to just what has happened to a country famed for attacking brilliance. Here, Sportsmail charts the alarming decline of several celebrated names that should, really, have been destined to play a major part in Brazil….

Out: Alexandre Pato

Out: Kaka

Out: Robinho

Out: Philippe Coutinho

Down and out: Neymar's spinal injury has left Brazil fans looking for alternative attacking options

VIDEO Brazilian celebration tempered by Neymar injury

Alexandre Pato

Caps: 27, Goals: 10

As a teenager, Pato was destined to be the star of this World Cup in his native Brazil. A precocious talent of extraordinary ability, he drew comparisons with the great Zico and broke Pele’s record as the youngest goal scorer in a FIFA competition as a 17-year-old.

He earned a move to Italian giants AC Milan and then the problems began. Milan’s medical experts attributed his series of injuries to a growth spurt, but his party-going exploits caused equal measures of anxiety.

Things started well, with the forward scoring 48 goals in his first 105 appearances but a high-profile relationship with the daughter of Silvio Berlusconi exposed Pato to the glare of the paparazzi, with the couple playing to the hype and relishing the publicity.

Return to Europe? Pato has been playing for Sao Paulo but might be on his way back to Milan with Inter

It was even alleged that she personally put a block on a move to PSG - out of love - after his form had begun to suffer.

Eventually, after making just 15 Serie A appearances in his final two years at the San Siro, he returned to Corinthians in January 2013.

His time at Corinthians was scarred by poor form and violence and now aged 24, a return to Europe with Inter may be on the cards this summer as he seeks to resuscitate his career.

Difficulties: Pato was seen as the next world class Brazil striker but he suffered with injuries in Milan

Kaka

Caps: 87, Goals: 29

Still only 32, Kaka, the former World Player of the Year remains an immensely popular figure in Brazil, with 20,000 supporters gathering at the Marumbi Stadium to welcome him back to Sao Paulo earlier this month.

Kaka, such a magnificent talent for AC Milan as the Rossoneri won the UEFA Champions League in 2007, saw his career stagnate after a sensational £56million move to Real Madrid, mostly due a serious injury to his left knee.

Four years on, he re-joined Milan on a free transfer last summer. He netted seven times last season but was unable to win over Luiz Felipe Scolari on the occasions that the Brazilian manager came to Italy to assess his performances.

Kaka is now heading to the MLS with Orlando - via a loan move to his very first club Sao Paulo.

Disappointment: His form in Italy earned a £65million move to Real Madrid but he struggled in Spain

Robinho

Caps: 92, Goals: 27

The boy wonder that once led one Spanish newspaper to declare: ‘And God created Robinho!’ is now 30-years-old.

There has never been a doubt over Robinho natural talent and the show-pony step-overs and shimmies represent all that the Brazilians adore about the game. His application, however, brings his ability into question.

He left both Mark Hughes and Roberto Mancini exasperated during his time with Manchester City, even if there were occasions when training would be paused so City’s young stars could applaud the latest moment of extraordinary inspiration by the Brazilian.

Outsider: Robinho had been tipped by some for a place in Scolari's squad but he was eventually left out

After scoring just six goals in his last two season with AC Milan, one of the brightest sparks from Brazil’s disappointing 2010 World Cup was omitted by Scolari.

Quite simply, the 2014 incarnation of the Brazil, characterised by their high intensity and highly disciplined game-plans, do not make allowances for luxury passengers. A move for US awaits.

Trend setter: Robinho was the first of the big money signings for Manchester City but he was frustrating

And what about Coutinho?

Caps: 1, Goals: 0

The Liverpool playmaker was a surprise omission to most observers that have watched Coutinho’s glittering performances at Anfield in the last twelve months.

And that perception has only been amplified by the shoddy showings produced by Hulk from the left wing in Brazil.

Potential: Coutinho played alongside Oscar in Brazil's successful 2011 U-20 World Cup campaign

Club form: Coutinho was brilliant for Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool as they finish second in the Premier League

Scolari opted for Hulk and Chelsea pair Oscar and Willian ahead of Coutinho and it is perhaps this decision that looks the most questionable as Brazil toil in the absence of their traditional flair at this World Cup.

Coutinho’s ability to produce an eye-of-the-needle pass and counter attack with pace and quality would have been a useful addition to Brazil’s forward line but at the age of 22, he still has time to break into his national squad in the coming years.

Missing link: It seems Coutinho's late-season Liverpool form was not enough to impress Scolari

Those three Brazil stars plus Pato were all left out by Scolari

Brazil go into their semi final with Brazil without the usual attacking flair

Neymar's injury leaves just Fred and Hulk as the hosts' main threats

Could the Selecao have benefited from those left out?
