Horrific: Kimberly Lindsey, 49, was found decapitated and missing her fingerprints in a South Florida sugar cane field Thursday

The doctor ex-husband of a beloved South Florida school nurse whose body was found decapitated in a sugar cane field Thursday would have been charged in her death but he killed himself before police caught up to him.

Authorities arrived Sunday to a Miami home owned by Dr. Albert Lambert to find his sister and her boyfriend carrying the physician’s corpse outside in a sheet.

The blood of his ex-wife Kimberly Lindsey, who had been missing since October 27, was found on his clothing.

‘The bottom line is we were going to 
charge him with first-degree murder, no doubt,’ said Sheriff Ric 
Bradshaw at a Sunday news conference in which he called the case 
‘closed.’

Lambert had 
overdosed after what the state’s attorney called his ‘brutal’ and 
‘premeditated’ slaying of his ex-wife and the mother of his children.

He
 took off her head and fingerprints and stashed the body. According to 
the Palm Beach Post, investigators have yet to find either.

An attorney for Lambert denied his client killed himself intentionally.

Lindsey's West Palm Beach school reported her missing early last week.

Her co-workers feared the worst from the start and a manhunt with 50 officers spanned across four Florida counties.

Her body was found days later in Hendry County by maintenance workers.

A
 cause of death has not been released, but a probable cause affidavit 
for Lambert’s arrest indicates that a bullet was found in the mother of 
three’s chest.

The 
sheriff's office said Saturday that there had been a violent 
confrontation at Lindsey's Palm Beach Gardens home, ‘after which the 
body was removed and taken to the remote area where it was discovered.’

Terrible twist: Police arrived at a Miami home to charge Lindsey's doctor ex-husband Albert Lambert--seen here with their three young daughters-- when they found his sister and her boyfriend carrying his corpse in a sheet

Grisly: Lindsey went missing October 27. Her three daughters and fearful co-workers had been pleading for help cracking the case. Unfortunately that break came in an unfathomable way Sunday when police closed the case, fingering Linsdey dead ex

Bradshaw
 said his office put Lambert under 24-hour surveillance after Lindsey's 
body was found and the missing person case became a homicide 
investigation. The U.S. Marshal's Office and 25 detectives worked on the
 case, he said.

Lindsey and Lambert divorced in February, but tensions continued through a child-support hearing last week.

The couple had three daughters, ages 16, 18 and 20.

While the search for Lindsey continued, her deeply concerned children and co-workers tried to remain hopeful she would be found.

‘It's
 heart-breaking to be away from her. It's harder than anything that 
we've ever been through and it's really scary not knowing what's 
happening and we will do anything to bring her home,’ Sarah Lindsey, 20,
 told ABC News.

At a 
press conference Thursday, Sarah described her mother as a ‘self-made, 
independent woman,’ who was a ‘nurturing’ and ‘loving’ mother.

Sarah, 20, the oldest begged the public at a press conference to memorize her mom's face and help find her. Her body was found Thursday in a South Florida sugar cane field missing the head and fingerprints, neither of which have been found

Heartbreaking: Their daughters Sarah, Savannah, 16, left, and Sophia, 18, right, are now left without their parents

‘Memorize her face,’ she pleaded. ‘Keep her in your head. Look for her. Do anything you can you never where she might be.’

Her co-workers gathered for a vigil Friday, where they prayed for their friend’s safe return.

‘She’s
 a fun girl and to think of never hearing her laugh again is 
heartbreaking,’ said Laura Hanley, a co-worker who organized the vigil, 
where friends lit candles and brought roses. ‘We’re looking for hope and
 miracles.’

Unfortunately
 that miracle wouldn’t come. And the bizarre end to this already sad 
case comes with few, if any, satisfying answers.

‘I
 hope that they take some comfort that an entire community grieves for 
them and is praying for them,’ said Palm Beach County State's Attorney 
Dave Aronberg.

Lindsey was last seen last weekend after a trip to Florida's west coast, and a text to one of her daughters gave no indication that anything was wrong, authorities said.

Bak Middle School of the Arts reported Lindsey missing. School officials say they will rename their clinic in Lindsey's memory.

Grief counselors will be at the West Palm Beach school Monday to ‘help both children and adults cope with this senseless act of violence and loss of life,’ Principal Sally Rozanski wrote in a letter to parents.

‘Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the entire family,’ Palm Beach County Schools Superintendent Wayne Gent said Saturday. ‘This is such a tragic event for the school and community.’
