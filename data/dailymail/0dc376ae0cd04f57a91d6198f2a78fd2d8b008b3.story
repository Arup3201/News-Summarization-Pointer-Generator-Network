This is the incredible moment a wingsuit flyer navigates his way through a narrow cave at speeds of 155 miles per hour.

Flyer Alexander Polli cuts through the air above a rugged mountainside in Spain.

The jaw-dropping video was uploaded to YouTube by Epic TV yesterday.

It begins with Polli jumping from a helicopter, which hovers above the Roca Foradaad Mountains in Montserrat, Spain.

Is it a bird or a plane: The incredible moment Alexander Polli navigates his way through a narrow cave at speeds of 155 miles per hour

He free-falls for about 20 seconds before descending to the cave at alarming speeds.

Polli seamlessly pulls off the move and flies directly through the narrow opening of the cave -  barely wider than him. 

The Italian-Norwegian athlete said he
hoped his success at his sport inspires others not only to 'climb over 
their mountains, but also to fly right through them.'

Wingsuit
flying sees athletes slice through the air using a special jumpsuit, 
called a wingsuit, which adds surface area to the human body to enable a
significant increase in lift.

In November 2012, Polli became the first jumper to succesfully strike a wingsuit target.

It was made of foam and around 10 ft tall.

The stunning, but terrifying, footage has been shared online and already attracted thousand of views
