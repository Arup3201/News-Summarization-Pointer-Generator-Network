A minuscule apartment, only 86 foot square, may not sound like an enticing place to live, but this particular teeny weeny flat in Paris has been transformed into an enchanting foldaway living space.

Hidden behind the cupboard doors is a secret bed, wardrobe, table and chairs, bookcase, bathroom and kitchen.

The flat at the top of one of Paris's Haussmann buildings was historically a maid's quarters but was more recently used as a storage room.

It was only when the family who owned it had an au pair arriving but no space in their apartment for her to live that they decided to convert the storage room into a mini bedsit.

To create the transformation, they enlisted the help of architects Morgane Guimbault and Gaylor Lasa Zingui from Kitoko Studio architectural firm.

'Despite the small area, the space had to be functional in order to sleep, and also to cook, eat, wash, work and store a maximum of items,' said Morgane.

The firm came up with the concept of a room that works like a Swiss Army knife.

'The Swiss Army Knife is a simple knife but, by a game of sliding and folding, it can contain a multitude of tools in a very small object,' Morgane explains. 

Hidden within the compact space is  a bed, a table, a wardrobe, a staircase, a micro fridge, microwave, a toilet, shower, bookcase, hidden sink and removable cooking plate.

All the amenities are fully integrated and can be closed away when no longer in use. Once all the elements are folded and stored, it frees up half of the area of the room.

The architects were also inspired by Japanese apartment design. 'It's really efficient in small spaces,' Gaylor explains.

'The biggest challenge was first to fit a full-size bed in such a small room - then finding the correct position for it. Fitting a bathroom with all the necessary amenities was also quite a challenge. After that, all the other parts of the design started to be obvious.'

But despite those challenges, Morgane says the hardest part of the project was convincing the clients to go ahead with it. 'The space was hard to understand on the 3D images,' she admits.

Once the work was finished, the wall stickers helped transform the space from a utilitarian cupboard into something a little more enchanting.
