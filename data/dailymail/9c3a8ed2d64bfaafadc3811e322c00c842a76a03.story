A new book is giving people an in-depth look at the very secretive world of marijuana farms in America.

Grassland is a collection of photographs taken over the course of four years in Humboldt County, California, by an anonymous photographer known simply as H. Lee.

From the planting and growing to the tending and picking, Lee had unparalleled access in shooting many of these never before seen workplaces.

All access: Anonymous photographer H. Lee spent four years photographing marijuana farms in Humboldt County, California

Stunning photos: Grassland is a sweeping look at the very private world of marijuana growing

Protecting the farms: Lee told growers she would never use her real name if she published her photographs

In the beginning: Smaller plants starting to grow

The result is a stunning and sweeping look at a very hidden industry. So hidden, in fact, most authorities in the sate of California cannot find these farms. 

Lee spent six years in Humboldt County before she began taking these photographs in 2010, right around the time Prop. 19 appeared on the ballot in California, which would have legalized marijuana in the state had it passed.

And while she did not live there full-time, she still considered it a 'home' by her own admission. 

These six years not only allowed her to get to know everything about the marijuana growing industry, but also  to gain the trust of her subjects, who eventually let her turn the camera on their world.

'I promised the growers and those I photographed that I would use a pseudonym if the work ever got published,' she said in an interview, via email of course, with Feature Shoot.

'As I had spent a lot of time there, I imagined that people would feel more safe if my real name wasn’t linked to the project. Secrecy and discretion are key components to growing weed in Humboldt, as you can imagine.' 

Prop. 19: Lee says many growers were happy when the California proposition to legalize marijuana was struck down

Secrecy: Though many allowed her in, some refused to let Lee photograph them or their farms

No surprise: Growers were not fond of any sort of press or media according to Lee

Not everyone, however, was willing to let Lee in.

'Many people weren’t into it, and wouldn’t give me access to their scenes at all,' she said. 

'And there were others who didn’t even want their body parts shown. Media of any kind wasn’t too popular up in the hills.'

Shockingly, she said many growers were happy when Prop. 19 did not pass, as they were afraid government regulations might ultimately drive down their profits once the drug was legalized.

Times are changing: Lee feels there has been a major shift in how the public feels about marijuana in just the past four years

Home: Lee spent six years in Humboldt County before she started taking photographs

Small groups: Many farms only had a few people around, unless it was time for picking

She also noted that there has been a major shift in the public's attitude towards marijuana in just the past four years.

'I started the Grassland project when Prop. 19 appeared on the California ballot,' she explained. 

'The county was all abuzz and in debate, and most seemed against it. But there were those organizing for the imminent change ahead, and plenty of new people inundating the area to cash in on what people are now calling a Green Rush.'

Hidden away: Many authorities would love to know the locations of these farms

Profits: Lergalization could cause trouble for some of these farmers and their profits

It's all here: Lee's book is out now

Grassland, published by Kehrer Verlag, is available now.
