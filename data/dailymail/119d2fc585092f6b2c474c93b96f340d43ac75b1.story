Thousands of people lined the streets of Kiev today for the funeral of a protester who was killed during clashes with police on the streets of the Ukrainian capital last week.

Mikhail Zhiznevsky, 25, was one of three people who died on Wednesday.

The Ukrainian opposition claim Zhiznevsky 
and another activist were shot by police in an area where demonstrators 
had been throwing rocks and firebombs at riot police for several days.

The government claims the two demonstrators were killed with hunting 
rifles, which they say police do not carry. The authorities would not 
say how the third protester died.

Last night the opposition demanded the resignation of pro-Moscow 
president Viktor Yanukovych to end the chaos currently 
engulfing the ex-Soviet state.

There were emotional scenes on the streets as Zhiznevsky's body was carried towards Independence Square in Kiev.

'He could have been my fiancÃ©, but he died defending my future so that I will live in a different Ukraine,' said Nina Uvarov, a 25-year-old student from Kiev who wept as Zhiznevsky's body was carried out of St. Michael's Cathedral.

Crowds shouted 'Yanukovych is a murderer' and 'Down with the criminal,' a reference to Yanukovych's run-ins with the law during his youth.

The coffin was then carried to the site of Zhiznevsky's death at barricades near the Ukrainian parliament.

In the past week, demonstrators have 
seized government administration buildings in a score of cities in 
western Ukraine, where Yanukovych's support is weak and desire for 
European ties is strong.

A crowd late Saturday besieged a 
building, throwing fireworks, firebombs and rocks, near the protest tent
 camp where about 200 police were sheltering.

By early Sunday morning, a corridor was created, allowing police to leave.

Elsewhere, action continues in Kiev and across the country. Pictured are demonstrators at a road block in the capital today

 Sunday, activists were cleaning up the devastated Ukrainian House 
building, sweeping broken glass and furniture.

The 
overnight outburst came soon after the hardline leader suffered 
humiliation yesterday as world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko, a 
political foe, snubbed his offer to become deputy prime minister.

Opposition
 heavyweight Arseniy Yatsenyuk - a former foreign minister - also 
rejected becoming the new premier without a string of major concessions 
including  new elections and the release of political prisoners such as 
Yanukovych's arch-enemy Yulia Tymoshenko.

The protests began in late November after Yanukovych 
shelved a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union,
 but they have been increasingly gripped by people seeking more radical 
action, even as moderate opposition leaders have pleaded for the 
violence to end.

About half of Ukraine's people favored deeper integration with the EU, according to polls, and many Ukrainians widely resent Russia's long influence over the country.

Zhiznevsky was from Belarus, a neighboring ex-Soviet country where hardline President Alexander Lukashenko has jailed and harassed his opponents.

Vladimir Neklyaev, a Belarusian opposition leader, came to Kiev to bid farewell to Zhiznevsky.

'Ukraine is showing Belarus an example of how one should fight for freedom,' Neklyaev said. 'I am sure that our countries have a common future in Europe, where neither Ukrainians nor Belarusians will die'

Despite an offer to release activists and stop more persecutions, the government continued a crackdown, with over 40 detained in the central city of Cherkasy after a protest, according to prosecutors.
