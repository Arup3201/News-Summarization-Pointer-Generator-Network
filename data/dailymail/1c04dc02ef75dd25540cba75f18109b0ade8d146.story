One Seattle Seahawks fan is so hugely confident in his team that he got a tattoo boasting about their Super Bowl 2014 victory before the season even began.

Tim Connors, of Edmonds, Washington, got the Seahawks logo and 'XLVIII Champs' inked on his arm months ago. He may be foolishly optimistic, he could even be a jinx, but you have to admire his faith.

Seattle are now just two games from a first Super Bowl win and face the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship match on Sunday. And Connors will be watching more closely than most. 

Counting his chickens? One Seattle Seahawks fan was celebrating his team's Super Bowl win - before the season even started

Faith: 'I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy at all. I'm confident,' Tim Connors said

'I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy at all. I'm confident, I'm 100 percent confident in every single player on that team,' Connors told ABC.

The Seahawks take on the 49ers in an exciting match-up on Sunday night, and if they get through that play-off game either New England or Denver await in the Super Bowl on February 2.

If Seattle fail, Connors will have to find a way of adapting his tattoo or endure a permanent reminder of a painful defeat.

Unfortunately for this superfan that won't be simple to do. Connors can't just tweak the tattoo if the Seahawks win next year as the 2015 game will be Super Bowl 49 - XLIX in Roman numerals.

And from 2016 and Super Bowl 50, all the Championship games will start with the Roman numeral L.  But, for now at least, Connors has no concerns about his tattoo remaining accurate.

He told Komo that he has 'no tiny little bit of doubt at all' that the Seahawks will bring the Vince Lombardi trophy home from the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Connors' tattoo artist was worried at first, but has no come round to his client's optimistic way of thinking.

Lonnie Moon of Good Karma Body Art in Edmonds, told Komo: 'I said, "Hey man, people are going to attack you â€¦ that you're the jinx of the team."'

But he said that Connors ended up convincing him otherwise. Moon explained: 'He's right, you know what, you think like that, you're not a real fan.'

Connors said that 95 percent of Seattle fans approve of his ink. He tells the remaining doubters that he is a true fan that believes in his team.
