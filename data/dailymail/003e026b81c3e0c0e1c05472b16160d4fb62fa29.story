There are some things that AP McCoy will not miss when he brings his astonishing racing career to an end this spring. Like having his doctor on speed dial.

Like being on first-name terms with hospital staff in pretty much every racing town in the country. Like clocking up more miles on the motorway than Eddie Stobart. And Norbert Dentressangle.

Like going out for a meal in the evening and gulping down a spoonful of guilt with every mouthful.

So, sure, when it is all over, the greatest jump jockey there has ever been may indulge himself a little.

He’s thinking of heading over to Mayweather-Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2. In fact, he’s planning two trips to Vegas in two months. The Hangover Part IV may be in the pipeline at this rate. Except, of course, McCoy’s teetotal. Next year, he wants to go to the US Masters. He’d like to play a bit more golf and watch a bit more of Arsenal.

But here’s the rub. Retiring from a sport that demands so much of him physically and mentally might sound like a release. But when McCoy talks about it, he makes it sound like a long fall from light into darkness. ‘I won’t ever be able to enjoy anything like I have been able to enjoy riding,’ the 40-year-old said in Lambourn on Friday.

There, in the little racing town nestled amid the rolling beauty of the Berkshire Downs, McCoy gave a press conference to talk about the approach of the Cheltenham Festival. The press release had pointed out it would be AP’s ‘last’ Cheltenham. 

That’s the way it is for the man who has dominated his sport for 20 years: every day for McCoy is a ‘last’ something now. The last time he’ll ride at Towcester, or Sedgefield, or Market Rasen, or Worcester. 

The last time he’ll beat Richard Johnson into second place in the Jockeys’ Championship. The last time he’ll ride up the hill to the finish at Cheltenham, the last chances he’ll get to add to the record 30 winners he has ridden there.

He took a bit of joshing in Lambourn from the compere, Luke Harvey, about how he might end his last Cheltenham without a winner.

‘However I do this year, it’s going to be better than next year,’ McCoy said, deadpan.

It feels like McCoy is in mourning already. The best part of his life is over. That’s how he sees it. It’s downhill at a canter from here. ‘No thrill,’ he said. ‘No adrenaline rush. There are going to be a lot of things missing in my life.’

This is not an unfamiliar scenario. He knows that and so do we. When the lights go down, sport’s greatest players often find real life a difficult anticlimax. It happens to fighters most often, although maybe that is just because their reluctance to leave the stage can be so desperately damaging.

Muhammad Ali is the most obvious example. Evander Holyfield is not far behind. ‘So gimme a stage, where this bull here can rage,’ Robert de Niro’s Jake LaMotta says as he reads his doggerel in Raging Bull. That’s what happens to sportsmen. They fear the loss of the rage, the thrill of the fight. It happens even to those who appeared to dance through their careers with great nonchalance.

I spoke to Robbie Fowler, one of football’s most iconoclastic characters, a few years ago when he had just come off the pitch in Brisbane after he had played in front of a sparse crowd at an A-League game.

His career was nearing its end but Fowler was eking everything he could from its embers. It was as if he suddenly realised what it had all meant to him. ‘I wish I was Peter Pan and I could play for ever,’ said Fowler. ‘It’s the only thing I have ever done. It’s the only thing I ever want to do.’

All his nonchalance was gone. McCoy has never been nonchalant. He has been far from nonchalant. But that isn’t making the spectre of retirement any easier. His lament for a part of his life that is soon to be lost sounds achingly familiar.

‘The hardest thing is that I’m still enjoying it,’ said McCoy. ‘I still really, really enjoy riding. That is the toughest thing.

‘What I would love to be able to do is retire tomorrow and come back as someone else and carry on as normal. Because I think, mentally and physically, I could. I do think I could perform OK.

‘I’m not retiring because I don’t think I could compete any more. I don’t think I’m any worse than I was or that I’m frightened of the younger lads coming through. Those are not the reasons.

‘I often think I am not sure why I’m retiring. I think every morning when I wake up “I don’t know why I’m retiring”, but I know it’s the right thing to do. I don’t mean this in an arrogant way but I don’t just want to be a normal jockey. I often think that if I was to carry on and ride three or four days a week and ride in the big races I could carry on riding for another five years. But that’s not me. I am an all-in person. That’s just the way I am.’

McCoy is already thinking of what might have been had he not taken the decision to dismount one final time. He is confident he would have been crowned Champion Jockey for the 21st season in succession next year. He said he could ride another 700 winners, thus reaching 5,000 in total. ‘With no problem,’ he said.

But there is something apt about McCoy doing it this way. He has lived with pain through much of his career. Now there is more. ‘I always had it in my mind that this is the way I wanted it to be,’ he said. ‘I’m not saying that I wanted to suffer but I wanted to retire when I was still enjoying it and it was still going to be a very difficult decision.’

He mentioned Sir Alex Ferguson and Joe Calzaghe as men who went out at the top, men he wants to emulate. There was no chance of him changing his mind. ‘That isn’t going to happen,’ said McCoy. ‘That’s just not me. I am a very stubborn human being.’

There is, though, one possible hitch emerging in his post-racing plans. Like other Arsenal fans, he watched the team’s capitulation to Monaco on Wednesday night with dismay.

‘Thank God I didn’t get to the Emirates,’ he said. ‘I was actually racing in Bangor but I saw some of it on the TV. I was thinking, “I’m not the only one who should be retiring”.’

I have always admired Kevin Kilbane and now I admire him even more. Kilbane has a 10-year-old daughter, Elsie, who has Down’s Syndrome, and last week he complained to the FA about West Ham fans singing a song that compared Spurs striker Harry Kane with a ‘****’. He was deluged with abuse but he did the right thing. Some things are worth standing up for.

Europe’s clubs pay the price for opening Pandora’s box

In the middle of the disquiet about the serpentine writhing that led to Fifa’s confirmation that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar would take place in our winter, it might serve us well to pull our punches just a little. 

Sepp Blatter leaves the International Football Assocation Board meeting in Belfast on Saturday

Nothing excuses the wretched machinations of Sepp Blatter  and FIFA but when leading European clubs welcomed massive investment from Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, we legitimised those nations as major players in world football. When you take the money, there is sometimes a price to pay.
