The heartbroken mother of a missing Victorian man is holding out hope that her son is still alive, after his ute was found bogged in scrubland. 

Dane Kowalski, 27, was last seen leaving his Diamond Creek home in north east Melbourne on December 12 last year after telling friends he was going a fishing trip.  

His mother, Vera Kowalski, arrived in Adelaide airport this morning and travelled to the remote town of Coober Pedy to meet with detectives in the hope of tracking down her son.

Speaking to 9News, Ms Kowalski said her family were living in hell at the moment. 

'What brings us here is to go to Cooper Pedy to see what information we can find about Dane,' she said after touching down at Adelaide Airport.

'And hopefully bring him home alive.'

'My favourite quote at the moment is it’s hard to believe we need a place called hell and that is from INXS off their Kick album,' she said.

Mr Kowalski's ute was found  on a deserted highway in remote South Australia today, three months after he vanished.

Reports from his family suggest his ute has been found bogged in scrubland. 

He withdrew $800 from his account and hasn't been heard from since.

The tradesman's white Holden Rodeo ute was discovered by local workers in scrubland about 95 kilometres south west of Coober Pedy, South Australian Police confirmed on Wednesday.

Mr Kowalski had claimed that he planned to stay at the Victoria towns of Wilsons Promontory or Leongatha until December 19 before he set off on his road trip. 

However, police now believe he may have instead been heading for  Darwin in the Northern Territory.

The car is being transported to Coober Pedy to be examined by South Australian Police in a bid to discover what happened to Mr Kowalski.

Inspector Ian Humby said that Police were intensifying their search for any information on Mr Kowalski's whereabouts.

'We're also examining the car and any of its contents for any information that might help.' 

'At this time there does not appear to be any suspicious circumstances.'

His family and friends have led a tireless campaign to bring Dane home and have spoken out after the latest development.  

'Dane's car has been found in scrub land off the Stuart Highway in South Australia,' his family and friends wrote on their Facebook page, set up to help locate their missing mate.

His friends and family have spent the past month retracing his steps from Melbourne to Darwin looking for signs of Dane and putting up hundreds of missing person posters along the way.

They have vowed not to stop until they find him. 

In attempt to find Dane, friends have set up a website and started a social media campaign, as well as printing shirts and stickers with his face on them. 

One of Dane's best friends, who has been friends with him since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered a $25,000 reward from his own pocket for any information. 

Dane hasn't touched his phone, bank account or social media accounts since he went missing

For three months his friends have campaigned tirelessly, imploring everybody to spread the message about Dane's strange and distressing disappearance

Brittany Taylor, the partner of Dane's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry.

'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then (December 12); his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said.

'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in.

'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.'

His friends and family have considered hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search.

Any sign, big or small, leading people to their website or raising awareness is necessary

'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said.

One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Dane's family that he may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken.

It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records.

Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him.

'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's okay. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home,' Ms Taylor said. 

'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.'

'He's one of the most amazing people you'll ever meet; he'd give you everything he had if he knew he could help you. You can't say a bad word about him, you really can't. He really loves life.' 

There has been no trace of the 27-year-old since that day: His phone and bank accounts remaining untouched

'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,' Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said 

Dane is described as being of Caucasian appearance, approximately 185cm tall, of athletic build with blue eyes and undercut brown hair. He was driving a white 2004 Holden Rodeo ute with the registration WN114. 

Anyone who sees Dane is urged to contact Triple Zero (000) immediately. 

The enormous search effort for Mr Kowalski has involved police, psychics, missing posters, a social media campaign, a website and various fundraisers. 

Now, his friends and family are considering hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search.

Four of the much-loved man's friends returned home two days ago after driving from Melbourne to Darwin, handing out missing posters and looking for signs of their missing friend. They flew back to Darwin on New Year's Day to continue their search.
