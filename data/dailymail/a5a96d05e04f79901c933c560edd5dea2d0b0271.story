Caught: Police arrested 21-year-old Kevin Michael Hagan after he was caught at a different break-in nearby

Nancy Pelosi’s home in Napa, California was burgled on Monday while the house minority leader was in Washington preparing for the presidential election.

The Napa County Sheriff’s Department has confirmed a break-in at the home on Zinfandel Lane near St. Helena. No one was home at the time of the break-in.

Police arrested 21-year-old Kevin Michael Hagan after he was caught at a different break-in nearby.

He admitted to burglarizing six other homes in the past week, including Mrs Pelosi's.

The news came one day before Pelosi got 
bad news about another house, when Democrats failed to take back control
 in the House of Representatives.

Police investigating around 2.50pm 
found smashed glass at the front door and at a separate pool house.

Upon his arrest, Hagan had a watch that was taken from Pelosi's residence.

Police were alerted after an alarm was tripped at the residence, said sheriff's spokeswoman Capt. Tracey Stuart.
