One of Manhattan's top restaurants has revealed that it's staff prepares for each service by scouring the internet for clues about their upcoming diners.

Eleven Madison Park has been ranked among the best restaurants in New York- and the world- since its opening in 1998 but they have continued to adapt and try to best the competition by virtually stalking their guests.

This level of service comes with a price, however, as meals at the contemporary American restaurant regularly run upwards of $225-per-person, not including wine.Â 

Setting the scene: Eleven Madison Park, first opened in 1998, has been known for its impeccable service as much as they are known fro their food

New York magazine describes how maitre d' Justin Roller spends hours using Google to find out as much about their guests before they step in the door to the Madison Square Park restaurant.

He looks at birth dates, wedding anniversaries, hometowns and employment to try to get a sense of how they can make their night special. If it's an anniversary,

Roller tasks himself to try and figure out which anniversary. He looks to see if they are interested in wine- posting photos with wine glasses or any links to brands that they like.

'If I find out a guest is from Montana, and I know we have a server from there, we'll put them together,' he told New York.

The restaurant is run by current co-owners, chef Daniel Humm and Will Guidara.

All the details: The menu changes daily based on the seasons and the tastes of the individual

Making every meal special: In addition to the standard courses on their tasting menu, they serve creative amuse bouche tasters to set the mood for the meal

Their waitstaff training process is known to be gruelling and even the most experienced servers who have managed other well-established restaurants are ordered to spend months on the most seemingly menial tasks.

From polishing silver during nightly service to scooping out servings of granola that is gifted to diners in mason jars at the end of the meal, every tiny detail is granted the same level of importance as that of the actual interaction with guests.

And even once the staff have 'graduated' to the level where they are split into teams of four and granted the responsibility to watch over a section of seven or eight tables, maintenance checks continue to keep them on their toes.

Institution: The tasting menu-only restaurant was featured in Sex and the City

The waitstaff has a 'family meal' before each service where sommelier Caleb Ganzer quizzes them about the 131-page wine list.

'There's nothing wrong with us being the star of the show.' co-owner Guidara told New York.

Experts in the field have determined that the dedication to service at the Madison Square Park restaurant has paid off, and they've won every award in the industry.

Humm won the James Beard Award for outstanding chef in 2012, they were named the fifth best restaurant in the world by San Pellegrino, and have been awarded perfect scores by both the New York Times and the Michelin Guide.
