Ryan Taylor's knee injury is not as serious as first feared and the Newcastle midfielder will only need five weeks of rest before returning to training.

The 30-year-old was forced off after just 33 minutes of his first Premier League start in 32 months during Saturday's 1-0 win over QPR.

Taylor has twice battled back from cruciate ligament injuries and returned after two years on the sidelines at Manchester City last month.

But the Scouser succumbed to injury on his St James' Park comeback and there were concerns that he had suffered a reoccurrence of the same problem.

Manager Alan Pardew held his hands together and looked to the heavens as Taylor made his way down the tunnel - and it appears those prayers have now been answered. 

Moussa Sissoko's strike was enough for Pardew's side to take all three points and record their fifth straight win - which moved them up to fifth in the Premier League table.
