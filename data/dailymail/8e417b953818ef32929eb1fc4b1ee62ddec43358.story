The man suing X-Men director Brian Singer for raping him as a teen claimed he had never actually been to Hawaii - where many of his explosive allegations took place - in a separate 2003 lawsuit that was unearthed today.

Michael Egan, now-31, stated under oath that he had never left the continental United States in part of a deposition, obtained by Buzzfeed, that was taken for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly took place.

The news casts doubt over his horrific claims last month that Singer and others drugged and raped him during a series of sordid pool parties in Encino, California, but mainly in a seven-bedroom estate in Kailua, outside Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1999.

Conflicting information: Michael Egan, pictured April 21, 2014, stated under oath that he had never left the continental United States in a deposition, unearthed by Buzzfeed, that was taken for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly happened

In the 11-year-old deposition, Egan directly contradicts much of his own case through his sworn statement that he'd never at that point left the mainland U.S. with the defendants.

Buzzfeed obtained six pages of the 84-page deposition. In those pages, Egan responds to a question about his travel, saying he'd 'never had any trips outside the continental U.S., no.'

He then specially refers to Hawaii, clarifying that another person did go to the state.

'I'm
 not sure how he interpreted the continental United States,' Egan's 
lawyer, Jeff Herman, told Buzzfeed of the remarks in the deposition. 
'I'm not sure what he's talking about specifically here.'

Herman
 said Egan's mother, Bonnie Mound, confirmed the trips to him, telling 
him she'd authorized either Marc Collins-Rector or Chad Shackley to take
 her young son to Hawaii at least twice. And Egan also confirmed them, Herman said.

However, in the deposition, Egan explained that he'd never traveled outside the continental U.S. because his mother would not let him.

Collins-Rector or Chad Shackley plus 
another man, Brock Pierce, were being sued in the previous lawsuit by 
not just Egan but four other co-plaintiffs.

The case, which played out in Los Angeles County court, targeted the internet entrepreneurs, who were allegedly the ringleaders in the abuse of young, aspiring male actors.

In the deposition, Egan was asked if he ever took any trips with the defendants, to which he responds that he did, to places like Las Vegas and Lake Havasu.

But he said he didn't not travel outside the continental U.S. though someone, likely another victim who's name is redacted from the deposition, did.

Asked where, he responds 'From what I recollect, I believe he went to Hawaii.'

When he's asked why the other boy went and he didn't, he said his mom would never allow him to anywhere within any far amount of distance, like Mexico, any of those' and would 'pretty much lock the door' when he asked.

Last month's lawsuit also claims Singer 'forcibly sodomized Egan' in the Encino mansion, an allegation not undermined by the newly publicized deposition.

However, the Hawaii allegations are vital to the latest case as Egan was able to file suit in the state because of an extended statute of limitations for older cases such as his. He filed April 16, 2014, just days before the April 24 cut off.

Scene of the crime? Egan was allegedly taken on two trips to Hawaii with Singer where they stayed at the Paul Mitchell resort, entrance pictured above. However, those claims are now in question

Meanwhile,
 another alleged victim, an unnamed British teenager, filed a lawsuit 
early this month alleging that the Hollywood heavyweight sexually 
assaulted him.

Now aged 25, the man accuses Singer of sexually abusing him when he was 17 at a London hotel along with Broadway producer Gary Goddard.

This second blow came after the X-Men director called the rape accusations made against him 'a sick twisted shake down' and announced he would be missing press appearances for his upcoming movie in light of the allegations.

Singer's attorney did not comment to Buzzfeed in regard to the latest news.
