Activists dumped $2000 in dollar bills onto a U.S. Senate office floor on Thursday and tossed the cash around, declaring it ‘Monsanto money!’

Occupy Monsanto, a group that supports the labeling of genetically modified foods, says that lobbyists for the agriculture giant are continuing to line the pockets of Congress members despite the shutdown.

‘The government is shut down, but you still have Monsanto lobbyists engaging with congress members,’ said activist Ariel. ‘We're here today to say that's not OK. Money shouldn't dictate how Congress makes decisions.’

'Government is shut down, but you still have Monsanto lobbyists engaging with congressmembers!': Protestors from the group Occupy Monsanto showered the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill with a sack of 2,000 $1 bills

'Monsanto money!': The activists gave out dubious 'Monsanto Minion' awards to congressmembers they say have a suspicious relationship with the controversial agricultural giant

Three were arrested during the protest, during which activists made ‘money angels’ in the piles of cash.

‘Nothing like a day on Capitol Hill lobbying - throwing money around- and getting arrested for it—WTF?’ tweeted Elizabeth Croyden, one of the activists hauled away by Capitol police on charges of crowding, obstructing and incommoding.

The activists wore wigs and business suits as the entered the Hart building around 1pm and posed as lobbyists from the Biotechnology Industry Awards Committee, reported the Huffington Post.

The group went to various other offices of members of congress to distribute their Monsanto Minion awards to lawmakers they believe are too friendly with Monsanto, before ending the protest by making it rain dollar bills.

According to Capitol police, the three arrested activists included Adam Eidinger (left) and Elisheva Shalom (right)

Elizabeth Croydon was also named as a one of the arrested activists. 'Nothing like a day on Capitol Hill lobbying - throwing money around- and getting arrested for it,' she joked on Twitter

They also gave Senators Mark Udall of Colorado and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts the award for introducing GMO food labeling legislation the group believes is too weak.

‘We want the federal government to enact a mandatory labeling law,’ activist Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director of the Organic Consumers Association, told the Huffington Post.

Arrested with Croydon, say the Capitol Police, were Elisheva Shalom and Adam Eidinger.

‘Today was off the hoof for kicking off #MarchAgainstMonsanto this weekend,’ Eidinger tweeted Thursday evening.

Starting in the Eighties, Monsanto began to genetically alter corn to withstand its herbicide Roundup, so that weeds but be eradicated but not crops.

Since then, the company has become a biotech and agricultural giant, and many believe the company’s products are unhealthy and its business practices unfair.

Regardless, there is fairly widespread acceptance of genetically modified foods in the U.S.

But more specific labeling of such products is slowly increasing.

Whole Foods Market, for example, announced this March that by 2018 everything it sells in the U.S. and Canada will be labeled to show genetically modified organisms.
