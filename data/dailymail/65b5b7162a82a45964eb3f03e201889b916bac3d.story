Manchester City host Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday night as Manuel Pellegrini's side look to prove their European class.

Barca lost at the weekend and are rebuilding their team, but still possess one of the greatest squads in world football, not to mention superstar Lionel Messi. 

But how do the two XIs compare ahead of the Etihad Stadium clash? Sportsmail's MIKE KEEGAN gives his verdict.

In Barcelona, City face one of the greatest sides in world football - but how do the two XIs compare?

Joe Hart 7.5 

Marc-Andre ter Stegen 7

Hart has the edge over the young German when it comes to experience. Talented Ter Stegen has been finding his feet in the Champions League but is back-up in La Liga.

Pablo Zabaleta 7.5 

Dani Alves 7.5

Two right backs who are on the wrong side of 30 but who show no signs of slowing. Both can attack, as Alves showed at the Etihad to devastating effect last time when he made it 2-0 to kill the tie late on.

Dani Alves killed the last-16 game at the Etihad Stadium last season, netting the second goal

Martin Demichelis 7 

Javier Mascherano 7

Two intelligent footballers whose brains make up for lacking a yard of pace. Demichelis will be hoping for a better experience than last year, when his red card changed the game.

Vincent Kompany 9 

Gerard Pique 8

Both can be considered among the finest central defenders of their generation. Kompany was a colossus in a losing cause at the Nou Camp last time.

Gael Clichy 7 

Jordi Alba 8

Ex-Arsenal man Clichy is a Champions League veteran who continues to improve for City. Alba, who stands at 5ft 6in, defied the odds to play for his hometown team and is now one of the finest left backs in Europe.

Fernando 7 

Andres Iniesta 8

Obama, as Fernando is known, has put in some presidential-like performances recently for City. Iniesta continues to be Iniesta - one of the greatest midfielders in world football.

Iniesta, pictured against Malaga at the weekend, is still one of the greatest midfielders in world football

Fernandinho 7 

Sergio Busquets 7

Manuel Pellegrini has admitted that possession is vital and this will be a key battle. At just 26, Busquets already has more than 70 caps for his native Spain and Fernandinho will need to fill the void left by the suspended Yaya Toure.

Samir Nasri 7.5 

Ivan Rakitic 7

Nasri has been inspired this season and the Frenchman has the eye for the killer pass that can unlock Barcelona. Rakitic, who struggles for the limelight in this star-studded team, could be Luis Enrique's secret weapon.

David Silva 8.5 

Lionel Messi 10

Twinkle-toed Silva is regarded by City fans as one of the greatest players in the club's history and he will be keen to shine on the biggest stage. Messi is having another belief-defying season with 26 goals and 13 assists already under his belt in La Liga alone.

But he must contest with Lionel Messi, who has 26 goals and 13 assists in La Liga this season for Barcelona

Jesus Navas 7 

Neymar 9

Navas may get the nod thanks to his pace but is still waiting for City lift off. Neymar, after a relatively quiet first season, is now showing why Barca paid close to £50m for his services but has been accused of antagonising opponents.

Sergio Aguero 9 

Luis Suarez 8.5

City hope a fully fit Aguero can be the difference after he missed the first leg and limped off 45 minutes into the second last year - that is how important he is. Suarez has adjusted well to a team which is not built around him and is relishing a more creative role.

Manchester City: Hart, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Kompany, Clichy, Fernando, Fernandinho, Nasri, Silva, Navas, Aguero - Total: 84/110

Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba, Iniesta, Busquets, Rakitic, Messi, Neymar, Suarez - Total: 87/110

Barcelona may be celebrating another victory at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night
