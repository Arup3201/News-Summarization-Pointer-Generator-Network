Pele is scheduled to leave hospital on Tuesday following his urinary tract infection.

Brazil's three-time World Cup winner, now 74, has been treated at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo since November 24, after being diagnosed with an infection that stemmed from an operation to remove kidney stones.

He has only one kidney, having had one removed towards the end of his playing career.

Pele will leave hospital on Tuesday after full recovering from urinary tract infection

The former striker was in such good health and positive spirits on Friday that he posted a video on Facebook that showed him playing guitar and he has now been able to escape regular observation and move into his own room.

Now he will return home on Tuesday, after addressing the media at 12.30pm local time (2.30pm GMT).

A statement from the hospital, signed by doctors Fabio Nasri and Marcelo Costa Batista read: 'Patient Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pele) continues clinical improvement without signs of infection.

'Considering his good recovery, his medical team has scheduled his leaving hospital tomorrow.'

Pele is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time helping Brazil win the World Cup three times, including in Mexico in 1970 when he was at his playing peak
