Imagine having an entire galaxy named after you.

That's exactly what happened to one amateur star gazer after he spotted a new galaxy as part of an online search for the BBC.

The galaxy, discovered by Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik, has been named 9Spitch after his nickname was misheard by a television producer on the Stargazing Live programme.

Zbigniew Chetnik was the first person to identify a unique galaxy 10 billion light years away from Earth. He is pictured here with his telescope in his observatory

Mr Chetnik, 60, was stunned when
 he found out that a blurry spec he spotted in an online search was a 
cluster of stars, gas and matter from a distant world.

He said he felt like he had 'won the lottery' after discovering the new galaxy 10 billion light years from Earth.

The service engineer from Badby, Northamptonshire, spotted the image of light from the galaxy being bent by gravity.

Incredibly, as the universe is estimated to be 13 billion years old it means his discovery is one of the nearest to the the Big Bang ever captured by an amateur.

Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik made his discovery as part of an online search led by the BBC's Stargazing Live programme.

The show recently launched a SpaceWarps 2 project asking amateur astronomers to find galaxies so massive that they warp space and time.

In general relativity, the presence of matter (energy density) can curve space time, and the path of a light ray will be deflected as a result. This process is called gravitational lensing

Scientists on the project are asking amateur star gazers to visually inspect astronomical in the hope they can findÂ  this 'gravitational lensing' phenomenon.

And despite scientists initially wanting to name the new star-system after Albert Einstein it was named after Mr Chetnik after being backed by Professor Brian Cox.

The amazing image - which captures the notion of gravity lensing - has since since caught the attention of observatories around the world.

Mr Chetnik said: 'The object at the front is two billion light-years away, and the object that just happens to be directly behind it, is another eight billion light-years away.

'Given the universe is only 13 billion years old, it means this object at 10 billion light years away is quite near the beginning of the universe.

'I was one of six people in the world who spotted the image.

'But apparently I was the first. It is very rare to get a perfect ring from these lensed objects, normally they are a crescent on one side.

'I have an observatory in my garden at home, and what interests me is deep space objects.

'People know you have to have a "clear sky", but for what I'm looking for it has to be very clear.

Zbigniew Chetnik, a service engineer, captured an image of light from the galaxy being bent by gravity from his back garden in Badby, Northamptonshire

'That's why when I saw the appeal for help with this on-line project looking for deep space objects, I thought I'd give it a go.

'To have some of the largest telescopes in the world looking at it, I realised it must be something very interesting.

'I've never won the Lottery, but I imagine this is what it feels like.'

The father-of-two made the amazing discovery as part of an online search led by the BBC's Stargazing Live programme.

Scientists involved with the programme used the Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank to look at the object and phoned observatories in the Canaries, and Hawaii to get more data on it.

But the galaxy discovered by Mr Chetnick - who is also known as 'Zbish' - was named 9Spitch after his nickname was misheard by a television producer.

Mr Chetnik added: 'The producers had asked my name and nickname, but they must have misheard Zbish as Spitch because that's what appeared on the screen, so people were suggesting 9Spitch as the object's name.

'Gravitational lensing was used to prove Einstein's general theory of relativity.

'And when they asked the public for names on the TV that was among those suggested.

'It was down to 9Stein and 9Spitch and I thought it would go to Einstein.

'But then Professor Brian Cox said it should be named after me to highlight amateur astronomy.

'I guess it's lucky in a way as Spitch was far more likely to be used then Zbish - it's much more snappier.'
