This is the terrifying moment an 11-year-old boy got stuck up to his THIGHS in dangerous quicksand 200 metres from the shore.

The young holidaymaker had tried to walk down to the sea at Brean, Somerset to wash his hands when he sank into the sand and became wedged while his parents watched on in horror.

They immediately alerted the coastguard and emergency crews, including a hovercraft, rushed to save the stricken boy.

Terrifying: This is the moment an 11-year-old boy got stuck up to his thighs in dangerous quicksand 200 metres from the shore at Brean in Somerset

Wait: The boy from Ebbw Vale, Wales, had walked down to the sea to wash his hands when he sank into the sand and became wedged

Rescuers hauled the youngster from the mud and he was taken to a waiting ambulance by the hovercraft. Luckily he was not injured.

Station Officer Steve Bird, from Burnham-on-Sea coastguard, said: 'The boy was completely stuck in an area of very soft mud.

'Heâ€™d walked out to wash his hands but an area of mud gave way beneath him and he found himself stuck.

Mission: A rescue hovercraft rushed out to save the youngster as his parents could only watch on in horror

Freed: Rescuers pulled him out and put him on a stretcher. He was then flown on the hovercraft back to the shore to a waiting ambulance

'We used mud lances around him to reduce the suction and free him before pulling him out and placing him on a stretcher. He was flown on the hovercraft back to the shore to a waiting ambulance.

'He seemed unfazed by the whole incident - it would have been a lot more serious if the tide had been coming in at the time.'

The boy, from Ebbw Vale in Wales, who had been staying at a Burnham holiday park, was relieved to be safely back with his family.

Lucky: The coastguard station officer said the boy seemed unfazed by the whole incident, and added: 'It would have been a lot more serious if the tide had been coming in at the time'

This is the latest incident at the holiday resort, notorious for its dangerous mud flats.

Just last month a group of Spanish holidaymakers had to be rescued after getting caught waist deep on the same beach.

The five had been seen wading through waist-deep mud over a mile from the shore.

And just weeks before, three 
holidaymakers had a lucky escape after sinking into the quicksand after 
attempting to get across the mouth of the River Axe between 
Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and Brean Down.

They were eventually located around 
half-a-mile from the shore but managed to haul themselves to safety 
after an estimated two hours in the mud.

One of the exhausted men - who were 
all aged in their late teens or early 20s - was covered up to his 
shoulders in sand and silt.
