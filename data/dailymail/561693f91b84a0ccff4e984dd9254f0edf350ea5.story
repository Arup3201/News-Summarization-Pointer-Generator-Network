A policeman seen punching a student in the face during a university protest will not face disciplinary action, it emerged yesterday.

The officer was caught on film swinging at hooded protester Tony Jones, throwing the 24-year-old off balance with a blow to the shoulder before flooring him with a jab to the face.

Last night the Metropolitan Police said no investigation had been launched and the officer concerned remained on duty in London.

Bosses at Scotland Yard said it had not received a complaint but would review any evidence.

A spokesman said: ‘As with all large 
public order incidents, a range of material will now be subject to 
review in order to establish the full facts.’

Student protester Tony Jones said that he was 'hit out of nowhere'

The alleged assault 
happened last Wednesday during clashes between police and students 
occupying part of the University of London Senate House headquarters in 
protest over staff pay and student debt.

Mr Jones, who is known as 
Tee Jay, was on his way out of the building after being evicted by 
security staff when he claims he was punched ‘out of nowhere’ by the 
unidentified officer.

He said: ‘There had been no swearing, no 
arguing. He just seemed angry. I couldn’t believe it. You see police 
brutality elsewhere on the internet, but I’ve never seen it in this 
country.’

The University of West London media studies student, from 
Hackney, east London, said he was left with a headache and a bruised 
back. Days later he said he made a complaint to police.

London 
Assembly member Baroness Jones, who is deputy chairman of the Police and
 Crime Committee, yesterday called for an immediate inquiry. She said: 
‘The Met shouldn’t wait for a complaint to come in before investigating 
what appears to be an officer assaulting a student.’

Police say they 
were ‘outnumbered’ during the protest in central London last Wednesday, 
during which four demonstrators were arrested and one charged.

But philosophy student Helen Singh said police were ‘punching people indiscriminately’.

She
 said: ‘We were walking away from the protest. I was pushed to the 
ground and my glasses smashed into three pieces.’ The following day up 
to 300 protesters gathered and hurled smoke bombs at police, resulting 
in 39 people being arrested on suspicion of affray.

Footage emerged on YouTube yesterday which appeared to show another officer hitting a protester in a separate incident.

The
 officer, wearing a high visibility jacket, is seen running across the 
road at a hooded group of activists carrying placards, pushing them over
 before landing a number of blows with his right fist. The University of
 London student union said protesters were ‘kicked and punched and 
dragged to the ground by their hair’.

President of the union, Michael Chessum, described the officers’ behaviour as ‘like a pub brawl’.

He
 said: ‘I’ve seen people having their teeth punched out. The police were
 not turning up with horses and batons they were just swinging punches.’
 Despite a court order banning occupations of university buildings for 
six months, students are planning another protest today.
