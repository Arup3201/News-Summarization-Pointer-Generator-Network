Police at a California concert venue claim a woman was asked to move to a different area because her baby was at risk in the pit with her - though the woman claims it was because she was breastfeeding in public.

A video taken at a Brad Paisley concert on Thursday shows Chula Vista police speaking to 30-year-old mother Megan Christopherson, NBCLosAngeles reported, who was there with her baby and another daughter.

'My child that is actually sleeping and I'm getting escorted by police,' she says through tears as she is led out of the pit.Â

Mother: Megan Chistopherson, pictured, said the issue on Thursday night was really because she breastfed her baby daughter in public

'Having your child where you are at, when the next bands start coming out, they're going to be even louder than what was already down there, okay?' the officer says to her in the video.

'You're child doesn't have hearing protection on,' he continues. 'The crowd is going to start surging forward. Where you're at your child could get crushed, so we're afraid of your child getting crushed and we're afraid of your child's eardrums being hurt, okay? That is borderline, probably child endangerment.

'You have two options, okay? They can re-seat you somewhere else, they can put you in another seat where you can be safe, or you can get a refund on your tickets. It's up to you; it's your call.'

In the video, Christopherson tells police she was at the same venue for a Tim McGraw concert in the pit with her baby and wasn't told to move.

Christopherson also says that security guards photographed her breastfeeding and told her to stop - though the police officer claims 'this has nothing to do with the breastfeeding part.'

Witness: Carmen Cooley-Graham, pictured, claims the incident was about other concert-goers in the pit upset Christopherson was in public breastfeeding

Christopherson tells police she wants her tickets refunded and turns down the offer to be moved to a different area.

The officer tells Christopherson that if she refused to leave the pit, she would have been charged. He says they contacted the District Attorney's Office - and that she cannot receive officers' badge numbers unless she identifies herself.

She told 10News the incident 'was completely a cop-out.'

'They're trying to cover this up because they know they legally cannot remove me for nursing,' she said.

The statement from Chula Vista police says officers spoke with Christopherson after security had already asked her to move and cited safety concerns.

Witness Carmen Cooley-Graham, who also spoke to 10News, wrote on the Chula Vista police Facebook page 'I don't know mom but I stood next to her for 2 hours and saw everything first hand- This is about BREASTFEEDING!! they had no issue-security guard was 2 people down from her and never once said anything until breastfeeding which no one could see. 5 girls tried to cut in front of her and when we all said no they texted a Elite security friend- then it became a breast feeding issue.'
