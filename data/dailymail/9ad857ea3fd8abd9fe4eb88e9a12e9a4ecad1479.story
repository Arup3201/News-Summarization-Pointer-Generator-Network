Love her or loathe her, she's become the most iconic model of our times, synonymous with high-octane glamour and rock and roll excess.

But a 20-year-old advert reveals that Kate Moss was once a relative unknown, very much in the shadow of ‘original’ supermodels Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, who also appeared in the commercial.

The advert was made for the release of Vauxhall Corsa 20 years ago and features a baby-faced, 19-year-old Moss.

Kate Moss is just 19 years old in the advert, which sees her ditch her grungy look for Hollywood-style glamour

Linda Evangelista, one of the biggest supermodels of all time, becomes jealous of the Vauxhall Corsa in the tongue-in-cheek advert

At the time, the Croydon-born model was 
known for her grungy style, but in the clip she oozes sophistication in a
 long, red evening gown.

Hair stylist Kerry
Warn, who worked on the ad, said of Kate: 'She was only a teenager,
but I think with the ad, we helped to add some glamour to her image.

'After
seeing the Corsa ad, in which I made her look quite 1960s in style, journalists
and the public realised that although they were used to seeing her in ripped
jeans, she also looked great dressed up as well.”

With her hair piled up on her head and 50s-style makeup, Moss features at the very end of the clip, which pitches the car as the ‘new supermodel’.

Christy Turlington looks like a stunning 40s film star in the stylish commercial

Moss's slot - in which she is nudged off a catwalk by the Corsa - is noticeably shorter than Linda, Naomi and Christy's sections. She was the new girl at the time and less well-known than the other models .

The tongue-in-cheek film shows Linda, Christy, Naomi and Tatjana Patitz all 
becoming jealous of the new Corsa car and making various attempts to 
destroy it.

Naomi plays a self-obsessed dominatrix, concerned her submissive man prefers the Corsa to her, while Christy throws a glass of water over a camera that strays from her to the car.

The ad
features in a new book titled ‘Vauxhall And I’. For more information
