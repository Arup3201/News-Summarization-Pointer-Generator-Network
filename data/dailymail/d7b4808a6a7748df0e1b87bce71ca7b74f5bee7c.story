Three men have been arrested after a woman reported to police that she was held captive, beaten and sexually abused for two months.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said investigators believe Jose Angel Barajas-Mireles, of Santa Rosa, California, masterminded the kidnapping of the 22-year-old woman.

Police said investigators believe that the woman was held against her will and repeatedly beaten and sexually abused in a rural home in Santa Rosa for two months.

Law-enforcement officers conduct an investigation  on February 19 at the Santa Rosa property where a woman claimed that she was kidnapped, held captive, beaten and sexually abused

Three men were arrested in relation to the case on Wednesday after raiding the home (pictured above, on February 19) and questioning seven people. Though none have been charged with kidnapping, one man was charged with aggravated sodomy, aggravated oral copulation and aggravated rape

The woman, who has not been named, initially said she had been held captive for three weeks but it was revealed later that she had been in the house since the holidays.

She escaped February 19 after noticing an open door in the house and sought help from the Petaluma Police Station, 15 miles from the home.

'It was brutal, absolutely brutal,' Sonoma County Sheriff's Sgt. Cecile Focha told The Press Democrat. 'The woman was terrorized.'

A sheriff's SWAT team raided the home the following day and seven people were detained for questioning. It is unknown if the three arrested were part of the seven who were questioned. 

Barajas-Mireles, 34, is also responsible for the sexual abuse and most of the physical assaults, investigators said.

The woman initially told police she had been randomly kidnapped at gunpoint from Roseland, the neighborhood where she lived, which is three miles from where she was held. None of the men were charged with kidnapping or firearms violations

He has been charged with aggravated sodomy, aggravated oral copulation and aggravated rape. His bail was set at $6million dollars, official said on Wednesday.

Jaime Gomez Cisneros of Watsonville and Guillermo Crestino Avina of Santa Rosa were responsible for guarding the victim and preventing her from leaving the compound, the office said. Each was charged with false imprisonment and being an accessory. 

The suspects were arrested when they went to the sheriff's office to retrieve property that was seized during the investigation, authorities said.

The woman initially told police she had been randomly kidnapped at gunpoint from Roseland, the neighborhood where she lived. But none of the men were charged with kidnapping or firearms violations.

'Out of an overwhelming sense of fear of retaliation coupled with the traumatic events she endured, she initially stated to law enforcement that she had been kidnapped at gunpoint,' the office said.
