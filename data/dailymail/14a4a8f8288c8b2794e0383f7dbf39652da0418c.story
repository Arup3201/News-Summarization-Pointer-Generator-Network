Mark Zuckerberg managed to kill two birds with one stone on Friday as he made a video for wife Priscilla Chan to mark their anniversary while also advertising a new service on Facebook that allows users to do the same thing for their friends and loved ones. 

Unfortunately for Zuckerberg, the link was broken and users could not access the new service.

As for the video, it featured a few images of Zuckerberg and Chan over the course of their relationship, with the Facebook founder thanking his wife for a 'wild ride.'

Mark Zuckerberg made an anniversary video for wife Priscilla Chan

The video featured photos of the couple from the past 11 years of their relationship

Mark and Priscilla met when they attended Harvard together back in 2003

There's the two hosting their first family Thanksgiving and riding horses in the sand on a no doubt obscenely expensive vacation and also dressing up like Mickey Mouse in Fantastia.

It is uncertain if that Thanksgiving fell on the same year Zuckerberg declared he would only eat meat he hunted and killed himself. 

Other pictures show Chan graduating from medical school and the pair hanging out at the Grand Canyon.

Many of the videos show the two with their dog, Beast

There is also a photo of the two hosting their first Thanksgiving together

Mark then provided a link for Facebook users to make similar videos, but the link was broken

And a whole lot of the photos feature the third member of their relationship, Beast, their Hungarian sheep dog.

Zuckerberg and Chan, who is training to be a pediatrician and at one point worked as a grade school teacher, were married in a simple ceremony that took place in the backyard of their Palo Alto, California home.

Mark and Priscilla married in May 2012 in a surprise ceremony

Their wedding had only 100 guests who thought they were going to a graduation party for Priscilla

The wedding was also a  surprise for most of the 100 guests, who thought they were attending a party to celebrate Chan's graduation from medical school.

The couple have no children, but do have a combined worth of $17billion.
