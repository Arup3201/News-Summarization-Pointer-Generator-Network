Five men involved in incidents on the Paris Metro ahead of a Chelsea match have been served with summonses, police have said.

The men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders', Scotland Yard said.

Controversy erupted last month when Chelsea fans were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a train ahead of the Champions League clash against Paris St Germain. 

Souleymane S, a black man, was prevented getting on a train by Chelsea fans in Paris in February 

Fans appeared to be chanting: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'

Footage captured by a bystander before Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain appeared to show a man being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'.

The commuter, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'.

He said: 'We're in 2015, aren't we, and we're in France. We're in a civilised country and when you are in a civilised country there are certain things you can't do.

'For me, it's a humiliation. I was humiliated in my country. I was humiliated in front of my family, humiliated in front of my mother and father.'

In light of the incident, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to establish whether police could make an application for football banning orders.

Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved.

 Souleymane has said he is still traumatised and would not accept the invitation to watching the second leg at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.
