Harry Redknapp insists his job as Queens Park Rangers manager is safe despite the club’s latest defeat which left them rooted in the Barclays Premier League relegation zone.

The Rangers boss was reported to be one defeat away from the sack on the eve of his side’s 2-0 loss to Manchester United. But he has hit back claiming he is in regular contact with chairman Tony Fernandes and there is no talk of him being replaced.

‘I don’t worry about that,’ Redknapp said. ‘That is their choice isn’t it? If they want to make a change. Just because someone writes in one newspaper this week suddenly everyone has to believe what they have written. I spoke to Tony Fernandes this week five times and he has never mentioned anything to me and just said, “What a load of nonsense”.

‘Who do you believe, the insider whoever he may be who is trying to cause a problem, or do you believe the chairman?

‘I don’t worry. What will be will be. It’s their decision. It’s their club. Tony is the chairman. I can only keep doing my best and I think we have done ever so well this year.

‘We are still amongst it. It was another set-back today but the bottom seven teams, from Everton down, there is nothing in it. It is very close and I still feel we have got just as good a chance as anybody.’

The R’s boss felt his players demonstrated their commitment to him with their first-half display. 

But they collapsed after the break when United substitutes Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson scored past Rob Green.

‘The players work hard every week. I can’t get any more, the players gave everything today. I can not ask any more from them on top of what they have given.’
