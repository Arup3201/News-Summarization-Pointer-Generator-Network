Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Sunday that the thorny question of whether to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples should be decided at the state level.

The position, a political insider in Florida told DailyMail.com, is calculated to leave his options open as he considers a run for the presidency next year. 

'It ought be a local decision. I mean, a state decision,' the former governor told The Miami Herald after a round of golf.

'The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it's been overturned by the courts, I guess.'

THREADING THE NEEDLE: Jeb Bush's states'-rights position on gay marriage could mollify conservatives even as he seems resigned to accept the federal government's role in legalizing the practice nationally

OFF AND RUNNING: Aaron Huntsman, left, and William Lee Jones, right, embraced Monroe County Clerk of the Court Amy Heavilin, center, on Friday in Key West, Fla. after completing their marriage license application; they plan to receive the license just after midnight on Monday. The couple successfully challenged Florida's anti-gay-marriage constitutional amendment in federal court

Florida voters approved a state constitutional amendment banning the practice in 2008, a year after Bush left the governor's mansion. But four months ago a federal judge ruled that the U.S. Constitution considers that move an illegal form of discrimination.

Bush said little six years ago about the ballot initiative that temporarily enshrined male-female unions as the only legal ones in his home state, but held the position that a state law banning gay marriage was sufficient.

His position seemed to evolve in 2012 when he told PBS that gay parents could be considered role models. But 'traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned' by governments, he added.

'If people love their children with all their heart and soul and that's what they do and that's how they organize their life, that should be held up as an example to others, because we need it,' he said then.

And in a 2014 speech, Bush warned that the GOP shouldn't allow itself to be seen as 'anti-gay.'

Some of that rhetoric neatly mirrors what other Republicans have said as they have appeared to soften their earlier hard line against gays walking down the aisle.

But the states'-rights position, an Iowa campaign consultant told DailyMail.com, is 'a band-aid approach that will – maybe – give conservatives just enough reason to hold their nose and vote for a Jeb Bush or a Chris Christie if one of them emerges as the 2016 nominee.'

Christie, the New Jersey governor, has drawn flak for cozying up to President Barack Obama, particularly after the White House sent much-needed relief funds following Hurricane Sandy.

FRACTURED: The US is the only nation where gay marriage rights are split along regional lines

On Friday, Idaho Gov. Butch Otter filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court appealing the legalization of same-sex marriage in his state, saying that defining marriage along traditional lines is better for children. 

He also said states – and not the federal government – should have the right to decide the issue.

Same-sex marriage was legalized in Idaho on Oct. 15 after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Otter's argument. He's now requesting reconsideration.

In Florida, though, the federal government has taken the reins. 

In August, Judge Robert Hinkle, decided against the 2008 Florida amendment but stayed his ruling until just after midnight Monday night to allow for appeals.

The Herald reported Monday that 'both a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down requests from Florida's attorney general to extend the stay until the appeal is heard.'

On Thursday Hinkle notified county clerks statewide that refusing to issue marriage licenses to gays and lesbians would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution beginning on Tuesday.

Bush's position drew jeers from the American Civil Liberties Union, which suggested his acceptance of state-level laws banning gay marriage made him an unsuitable presidential candidate. 

'So the people should have the right to enact a discriminatory law?' asked Florida ACLU director Howard Simon. 'That sounds like what he was saying.'

'That unfortunately is consistent from what I remember about Jeb Bush's tenure as governor.'

Bush faces an uphill climb with the right wing of his party as he explores the feasibility of a 2016 White House run.

Conservatives see him as soft on tea-party issues and have already put him in what one GOP Capitol Hill staffer called 'the Mitt Romney box' on Tuesday.

'If he runs, he's going to be the Romney guy this time around. Or the John McCain guy,' the aide to a right-wing Republican House member said. 'And we've seen how well that turned out.'

Both Romney and McCain lost their elections to Obama.

Bush is polling in the top rungs of Republican contenders.
