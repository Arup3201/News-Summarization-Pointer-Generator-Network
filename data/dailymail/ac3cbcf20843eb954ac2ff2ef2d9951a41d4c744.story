British and Irish Lions star Leigh Halfpenny could have his bumper Toulon contract ripped up before he has made an appearance for the European champions.

The Wales full back became the latest superstar to join Mourad Boudjellal's revolution on French Riviera side when he left Cardiff Blues at the end of last season.

But a groin injury picked up in pre-season has led the Toulon owner to threaten to terminate Halfpenny's contract.

Cardiff Blues are interested in re-signing Halfpenny should he leave big-spending Toulon

'Today, we must address this issue because we need a world-class goalkicker. We're awaiting the medical update,' Boudjellal told Varmatin.

'He should be out for another two or three weeks. But the problem that we have now is that we think he may have arrived at Toulon with that injury. Now we have the impression that yes, he was injured when he signed for Toulon.

'If this is the case, we haven't ruled out terminating his contract.

'We pay enough for players (when they're away) for their national teams. We don't feel like preparing Halfpenny for the Rugby World Cup for Wales.

'We're conducting an investigation. I will know the whys and hows this week.'

Blues chief executive Richard Holland confirmed the region's interest in Halfpenny should he become available.

'Cardiff Blues offered Leigh Halfpenny a contract prior to his departure to Toulon, and of course, we would be interested if he became available, be that on a dual contract or a regional deal,' Holland told Wales Online.

'We will be speaking to his representatives to find out the state of play regarding his contract situation and we will take things from there.

'We would be extremely keen to have back a player of Leigh's calibre, and I am sure it would excite our supporters.

'If the reports are true, we are keen to explore this.'
