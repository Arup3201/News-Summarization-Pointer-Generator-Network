Hearing the roars of lions only meters from your bed would normally be a cause for concern, but for the guests at Jamala Wildlife Lodge, waking to the sounds of the safari is all part of the experience.

Nestled in the heart of Canberra, the Jamala Wildlife Lodge at the National Zoo and Aquarium offers a taste of South Africa, all from the comfort of luxury accommodation.

Daily Mail Australia took an intimate look inside the Australian capital's newest, and most unique, wildlife encounter.

The Lodge consists of 18 rooms built around the zoo, all of which offer a different, but still up-close, experience of the animals that is unlike anything else offered around the world.

Arguably the most spectacular are the jungle bungalows, which are built right up against the side of either the sun bear, brown bear, or lion enclosure. 

One wall of the bungalow is made entirely of glass, looking out over the animals domain, and with a room cut into the hut where the animals sleep.

Imagine waking up and seeing a 240 kilogram white lion staring at you as you struggle to remember where you are, or, as some guests have done, pulling sheets and blankets to lay on the ground next to the glass to sleep just centimeters away from the African kings.

The Ushaka Lodge, a word which means 'shark', boasts a wall of it's namesakes built into the structure of the large and luxurious resort-style manor.

Split over two levels, the Lodge offers family-sized rooms and is built over the zoo's aquarium, and up against the lodgings of one of the zoo's many primate enclosures.

Leather couches and carved wooden chairs offer spots to sit, drink a cup of tea, have a snack, meet new friends, and simply soak in the atmosphere of the perfectly crafted safari lodge.

All of the rooms are decorated to encourage the sense of an escape to Africa, decorated with plush couches in sand hues, stunning wall mosaics in the shape of giraffes or fish, and filled with delicate and one-of-a-kind pieces which were handpicked by one half of the zoo's founding team, Maureen Tindale.

Maureen, along with her husband Richard, run the privately owned zoo, and have lived on the grounds for 14 years.

Passionate about educating more people about the need to protect and preserve endangered species, the Tindale's see the launch of Jamala Wildlife Lodge as a way to provide personal encounters with the creatures they love.

The funds raised from the Lodge will funnel straight back into the zoo's breeding program, in the hope that greater awareness will lend itself to greater preservation of some of the world's rarest animals.

'You get a lot of emotional reward from caring for the animals. It's great when you can take animals from bad situations and give them room to breathe,' Richard told Daily Mail Australia.

Many of the animals in the zoo are rescue animals, including the white lions, Mishka and Jake, who Richard found in a 'tiny little enclosure' at just ten months old.

The pair now recognise him and will come when he calls them, to the delight of guests.

'When you get them out of there, once you give them a bit of love and attention they really respond,' Richard said.

The couple transformed their family home, in which they raised six children, into the Ushake Lodge to offer others a small taste of the joy they get from living alongside the animals.

'We lived here for 14 years and we thought they'd have to carry us out. We brought up six kids, and it is our home,' said Richard.

'But as much as we love it, we thought it was too good to keep to ourselves. We wanted other people to be able to use it,' he said.  

The lodgings have been thoughtfully designed to interact with the surrounding environment, enfolding guests in a luxury cocoon which breaks as soon as the door is open onto the zoo.

Just outside the door is the National Zoo's well-loved aquarium and animal enclosures, a space which is growing by the day as the attraction expands and more animals are introduced.

From meercats, monkeys, and marsupials, to giraffes, rhinos, and zebras, the zoo is filled to the brim with animals to learn about and observe.

Staying overnight in the Jamala Lodge includes two private tours around the zoo, including an early morning expedition to pat rhinos, feed antelope, and wake up tigers.

The guides are charismatic and informative, genuinely passionate about the work that the zoo is doing and the international programs it is involved with.

The tours also include an exclusive look at the zoo's newest residents, which are still secluded from the public in the newly built second half of the zoo.

The National Zoo is in the process of introducing more giraffe, cheetahs, painted dogs, leemurs, and other exotic creatures.

It's not just the interaction with the animals that make the stay special, however, as no expense has been spared to create a five-star hotel stay in the midst of a safari environment.

For those staying in the Ushaka Lodge, there is an open bar 24-7, with refreshments- including unlimited alcoholic beverages- available the entire stay. 

The Lodge's infinity pool is right outside the doorstep, and overlooks both the zoo and Lake Burley Griffin

The meals are generous, incorporated into the timetable in a way that provides a chance to relax and meet other guests.

After a break of several hours, which gives guests a chance to luxuriate in the spa bath, dip in the infinity pool, or continue wandering around the zoo, pre-dinner drinks are offered out on the Lodge's terrace.

Champagne, top-tier wine, and other beverages can be enjoyed while overlooking the zoo, as the hyenas make themselves available for feeding just metres away.

Jake and Mishka, the white lions, also make an appearance in time for dinner, entering the specially designed glass enclosure which adjoins the dining room.

The communal dining area is situated in an expansive room, converted from the old aquarium, fronted on two sides by animals just behind glass who curiously paw at the windows as guests walk by. 

'The interaction between the venue and the animals is a fantastic plus,' said Peter O'Loughlin, who stayed overnight with his wife Kerrie.

'Lions coming up and watching you eat dinner and hyenas looking over shoulder is completely unique,' he said. 

The three-course dinner is a selection of traditional South African fare, including a seafood and tapas entree, roasted meats and fresh salads for mains, and cheese, fruit, and a native version of sticky date pudding for dessert.

After dinner, guests have free roam of the zoo and aquarium, and for those lucky enough to stay in the master suite of the Ushaka Lodge, a 'shark experience' is offered.

A door from the second-storey room, which overlooks the Lodge's loungeroom, leads into the back area of the aquarium where the zoo keepers feed the marine life and dive to check on the animals health.

The shark experience involves feeding the zoo's resident tawny shark, a three-metre long gentle giant with no teeth, which has been trained to surface for treats of squid.

Guests have the chance to 'pat' the shark from their private jetty, under the close eye of the zoo keeper who may need to bat a hand away from the surface should some of the smaller sharks, who do have teeth, swim by.

Encounters with the other animals are also available, including feeding the cheetahs and lions, an experience which guests said was unforgettable.

'The level of hospitality and the private tours made it a weekend to remember,' said Mr O'Loughlin.

The zoo will continue to be a family business, a principle which makes the Jamala Lodge an intimate and unique experience for animal lovers and holiday seekers alike.
