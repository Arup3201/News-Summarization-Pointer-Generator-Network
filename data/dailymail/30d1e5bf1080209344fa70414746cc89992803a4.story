A major speech given by Gerry Adams at the height of the Northern Ireland peace process was written by one of Tony Blair’s senior aides, it has been claimed.

Jonathan Powell says he drafted the speech for the Sinn Fein leader, in which he said could ‘envisage a future without an IRA’.

Mr Powell was chief of staff in Downing Street throughout the Blair years, and the revelation he wrote a speech for the Republican leader is likely to cause alarm in Northern Ireland.

A major speech by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams at the height of the peace process was drafted by 

Mr Powell revealed his role in the speech in a new book, ‘Talking to Terrorists’, in which he details the painstaking process of trying to bring together all sides to end the Troubles in Northern Ireland/

He played a major role on the British side in negotiating peace, but has now revealed he helped the Republicans behind the scenes after a request from Mr Adams.

The claim focusses on a speech given by the Sinn Fein President at the Hillgrove Hotel in Monaghan on Saturday October 26, 2002.

The Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998 was in danger of collapse, because the IRA had failed to fulfil promises to decommission weapons.

Mr Powell says in his book that delberatly ambigious language used by both sides in the early stages of the peace process was necessary to secure agreement, but was now becoming a block to peace.

In extracts of his book published by the Irish Independent today, Mr Powell writes: ‘We felt that we had to address the ambiguity or lose the agreement, so Tony Blair made a speech in Belfast in which he demanded that Sinn Fein choose between the Armalite and the ballot box.

‘We were nervous about the response but Adams called me a few days later and said, to our relief, it was a good speech. To my surprise he asked me if I would draft his response.

Jonathan Powell was Tony Blair's chief of staff for a decade in Number 10, and played a key role securing the Good Friday Agreement which led to peace in Northern Ireland

He added: ‘I tried to write in Republican-speak and composed a passage that ended with 'People ask me do I envisage a future without an IRA? The answer is obvious. The answer is yes.'

‘I turned on the television a few days later to see Adams deliver the speech unchanged,’ he adds.

In the speech, Mr Adams said: ‘I want to see an end to all of the armed groups on this island. That has to be the aim of every thinking republican. So if you ask me do I envisage a future without the IRA?

‘The answer is obvious. The answer is Yes. And who can influence the IRA most? The British government - the unionists - the Irish government and us as well of course. All of us have to make politics work.’

A spokesman for Sinn Fein said speeches and specific phrases were often shared with the British government during the talks.

‘All of this was as part of ongoing efforts to help the situation. However, Gerry Adams is very clear that 'any remarks I made were entirely my responsibility and not scripted by anyone outside Sinn Fein,'" they added.
