Taylor Swift returns as model and contributor for the second season with casual shoe brand Keds.

The singer, 24, is all dolled up in a set of images wearing the latest range, sporting her signature preppy retro style.

In one image she perches on a director's chair, pairing red sneakers with red lipstick (her favourite colour). She wears monochrome capri pants and a black top to complement the look.

Taylor teams up with American shoe retailer Keds for a second season, and releases a range of styles available to Britons on the UK site. 

The collaboration is the singer's first foray into fashion, as she oversees and contributes to design choices for the new 16-piece FW14 Taylor Swift range of shoes.

The new season sees the launch of fresh styles like the Boyfriend and a new version of the famed Oxford in a slew of leather options, as well as the debut of a new weatherproof boot.

The line is inspired by Taylor's signature style statements, including chic polka dot and floral patterns ,and her favourite colour, red, in muted tones for the cooler months.

'The fun part about style is that you can change it; it's like an ongoing art project,' she said.

Speaking previously about her debut collection in spring, Taylor said: 'I think it's fun to experiment with your style. Shoes are an opportunity to add a pop of colour or something unexpected.'

She joins the likes of other famous style icons Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and Jackie Kennedy Onassis who have worn the footwear over the brand's 98-year history.

'The women in history who played a huge role in shaping my fashion are the women who have famously worn Keds throughout the years,' Taylor told Hollywood Life.

Keds president Rick Blackshaw says of their most recent star recruit: 'Taylor's approach to creating an unforgettable fashion point of view puts her at the forefront of a new generation of iconic women who love Keds for their timeless appeal and feminine style.'

The new Boyfriend style features a defined heel and is a highlight in the range. Its crisp, borrowed-from-the-boys style makes them the perfect shoe for a polished look, especially in plaid.

'The Boyfriend is an exciting shoe for us; it captures Taylor's timeless style and we're thrilled it's a part of the new collection,' said Rick.

'We know our girls love wearing Keds as they head back to campus, but they love options even more, so we're using materials and patterns like wool and plaid that can be worn into late fall.' 

The shoe sits alongside iconic styles like the Rally, shining for fall with a metallic polka dot print and coordinating trim that pops against jewel tones; and the Champion, offered this season in denim and wool to add layers of warmth and texture.

A bold floral with a dot overlay, sweet hearts on repeat, and a unique embroidered emblem featuring Taylor's favorite number round out the collection. 

Finishing touches include a special charm in one of two styles: a gold heart with the number 13, or a guitar pick in antiqued brass with Taylor's logo inscribed in the middle.
