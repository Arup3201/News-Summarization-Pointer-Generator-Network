Brendan Rodgers has cast doubt over whether Mario Balotelli will be a long-term success at Liverpool.

The Italian striker has yet to score a Premier League goal in red since his £16million move two months ago, and was subject to criticism on Wednesday night after a poor performance against Real Madrid.

The former Manchester City and AC Milan forward's decision to swap shirts with opposing defender Pepe at half time caused widespread condemnation.

Liverpool striker Balotelli has been widely criticised for his performance and behaviour against Real Madrid

And Rodgers, who says any punishment will be given internally, says Balotelli is trying his best but may not be a star in the future.

'He is working very very hard on the training field and trying his best,' said Rodgers. 'Whether his best is good enough long term we will see but that applies to every player.'

'The Mario Balotelli show is no different for me. He is tested the same as everyone else. I like players that are different. 

'I like individuality but they have to be able to fit into a team. He is working hard for the team.'

Liverpool were outclassed by a rampant Real with the outstanding Cristiano Ronaldo and Colombian star James Rodriguez to the fore at Anfield.

‘Last night should have been a great night,’ said Rodgers on his side’s 3-0 defeat by the Champions League holders. ‘I looked at the game as how far we have come. Two years ago we were a long, long way from playing Real Madrid.

‘Now we are not only playing them but people are expecting us to beat them. Any blame that is given towards the team is taken as a collective.

‘At 3-0 you are playing for pride and I thought the players responded magnificently. I think it was a huge credit to my players that they kept going right until the very end.

‘That period before half-time cost us. The objective is to qualify from the group and we are still on target for that.’
