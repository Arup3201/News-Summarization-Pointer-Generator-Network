Trevor Francis has slammed Liverpool's summer transfer activity and claims spending just £4million on a replacement for Luis Suarez won't be enough for the Reds next season.

Brendan Rodgers has forked out £100million on new players so far, but Francis believes the Liverpool squad still lacks balance.

He told Sky Sports: 'There’s £100million spent and only £4million put aside for a striker, that being Rickie Lambert.

'I just think that somewhere along the line the balance is not right. He (Rodgers) needed a £30million striker.

'Ultimately it might come back to bite him. Whatever he’s going to do, he has got to be positive and I believe he’s got to do it before the transfer window closes at the end of August.'

The former England international also believes 32-year-old striker Lambert is struggling to settle into his new team.

Francis added: 'I’ve watched him in three or four games and in one game he was taken off at half-time and today he struggled throughout. He didn't look comfortable playing in those surroundings.'
