Rights: the judge ruled that Ms Quashie had been employed by Stringfellows and can sue the club for unfair dismissal

A former £200,000-a-year Stringfellows lap dancer won a landmark legal battle yesterday to become the first stripper to sue for unfair dismissal.

Nadine Quashie, 29, claims she was wrongly fired by the Covent Garden nightclub in December 2008 over allegations of drug dealing.

She had been refused permission to bring a case by a panel Central London Employment Tribunal because it decided she was self-employed.

But His Honour Judge McMullen overturned that ruling today at the Employment Appeal Tribunal.

Her legal triumph is set to benefit thousands of strippers and lap dancers who have until now been unable to sue even where they work long, regular hours under their club's control.

The judge found that Miss Quashie was employed by Stringfellows because the club imposed contractual obligations on her.

Miss Quashie, of Greenford, west London, will now seek up to £63,000 in compensation for alleged unfair dismissal when her case goes back to the original tribunal.

Miss Quashie's solicitor Shah Qureshi, of law firm Bindmans, said of the landmark ruling: 'This is a victory for common sense.

'His Honour Judge McMullen considered some very important issues concerning the contractual obligations of stringfellows in relation to its dancers.

Poles apart: the club owned by Peter Stringfellow has said Ms Quashie's case is based on 'lots of little lies'

'Nadine has been fighting to get her basic employment rights for many years and this is a vindication of that struggle.

'The decision is likely to impact on many dancers in the industry who, until now, have been vulnerable to exploitation through questionable practices.'

The judge heard how Miss Quashie had to work set days and attend meetings at the club - or face being fined.

Miss Quashie, a single mother, had to comply with the club's strict image and dress code that saw her dance topless wearing only a G-string on stage and naked in private.

While working she had to be on standby ready to perform free pole dances whenever summoned by the DJ.

Miss Quashie also claims she had to perform free dances for customers 'on the hour every hour' whenever the Motley Crue song 'Girls, Girls, Girls' was played. She says she could be fined £10 for each part of a song or whole song that she missed.

She would earn up to £1,265 a night as wealthy customers stuffed prepaid vouchers called 'Heavenly money' into her garter.

And she had to get a manager's approval for 'any agreement with a customer worth more than £300 to the dancer'.

At the end of each night, the club had to give Miss Quashie cash for the vouchers she accumulated - minus its fees and commissions and any fines.

Landmark case: Ms Quashie's solicitor said the ruling was good news to lap dancers who are vulnerable to exploitation by club owners

Miss Quashie was a women's rights campaigner while studying accountancy and finance at Thames Valley University.

She began her legal battle against Stringfellows after she was sacked in December 2008 over drug dealing allegations that she denies.

Stringfellows denies that she had to give free dances to customers and is vigorously contesting her claim of unfair dismissal.

The club's barrister Caspar Glyn told the original tribunal her case was 'constructed on lots of little lies'.

A panel at Central London Employment Tribunal will now hear the unfair dismissal claim at a later date.
