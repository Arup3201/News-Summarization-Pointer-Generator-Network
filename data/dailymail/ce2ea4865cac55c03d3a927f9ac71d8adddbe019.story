A man has been charged after he allegedly offered a lift to a 15-year-old girl and then drove her to a location where he sexually assaulted her.

The 39-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday following the incident which occurred after he allegedly picked up the girl and her friend in Potts Point in inner-city Sydney on December 8 last year.

Police allege the man, from Marsfield in Sydney’s northern suburbs, approached the two girls while they were walking on Darlinghurst Road and offered to drive them to a nearby location.

The pair accepted the lift but when the 15-year-old’s friend got out of the car the man allegedly refused to let the teenager get out with her.

Police allege he continued to drive and sexually assaulted her before he allowed her to leave.

The 39-year-old man was arrested at Ryde Police Station just before 10.30am on Wednesday and charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of detain person with intent to obtain advantage.

He was refused bail and will appear at Burwood Local Court on Thursday.
