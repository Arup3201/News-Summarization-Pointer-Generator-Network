West Ham have joined the race to sign free agent midfielder Gareth Barry.

The 33-year-old has offers from Everton and Arsenal but the Upton Park club are trying to improved terms over a two-year deal.

Everton have offered Barry around £50,000 a week while Arsenal's is similar but Barry knows his playing opportunities would be more limited at The Emirates. West Ham are looking to push closer to £65,000 a week and would offer regular football.

Barry has been a roaring success at Goodison Park in his anchor midfield role and Roberto Martinez wants him to continue aiding the younger players in the squad to develop. However, their concern that Barry could move elsewhere is reflected in the fact they are exploring potential deals with other players.

West Ham are understood to be considering bringing in former Everton chief scout Tony Henry as part of a revamp on recruitment.

Henry used to work as an agent with Paul Stretford's Formation Group and helped Jorge Mendes to establish links in England.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is also interested in Joleon Lescott and is looking at a possible deal for Martin Olsson at Norwich. He will find out later today if Mauro Zarate has signed his three-year contract after arriving to finalise his move from from Velez Sarsfield. Chelsea's Demba Ba is still of interest to West Ham although he has an offer from Besiktas. 

Juventus have made a rival offer for Arsenal target Antoine Griezmann. 

The French winger has several admirers including Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool but Arsenal are understood to have followed up interest with an £18million bid for Real Sociedad's star performer who scored 20 goals last season. 

Juventus have opened talks with Real Sociedad sporting director Lorenzo Juarros and president Jokin Aperribay as the Italian champions look to place a bid of their own.

Benfica and Monaco still want to hold talks with Tom Ince about a potential move.

Ince and his father Paul have been in Italy meeting with Inter Milan officials over the 22-year-old's imminent transfer but Benfica and Monaco remain interested in a deal also. They will have a tour of the training ground and facilities before returning home on Tuesday.

The pair were caught by Sky Sport Italia at Linate Airport in Milan and Tom said: 'I’m not yet an Inter player, I am very happy in the meantime to stay here for two or three days. Inter are a great team, Italy is a fantastic country, of which I have great memories.'

Embellishing his own CV, Tom added: 'It is wonderful to be here aged 22. I’m young, English, I am a winger, a fun player to watch. Inter is changing, there are new young players and new leadership. And they are one of the most important clubs in the world.

'Have I spoken with (president) Thohir? He has told me that there are some changes, he wants to return Inter to greatness, to winning in Italy and in the Champions League, back to the level of this club. It’s great for me.'

His father Paul added: 'It’s amazing that Tom is here now aged 22, he was five then. Now I am here for my son, I think you will know everything in a couple of weeks.'

Sunderland have expressed an interest in signing Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni.

The 35-year-old Argentine is a free agent despite Palace holding initial talks over extending his contract.

Gus Poyet is interested having lost Keiren Westwood and Oscar Ustari who is looking to return to football in Spain.

Sevilla, meanwhile, are showing interest in Sunderland midfielder Alfred N'Diaye.

Leicester City have expressed an interest in Benfica striker Oscar Cardozo.

The 31-year-old has admitted he could leave this summer but the Portuguese champions want around £12million.

Benfica representatives are due in London today for talks with interested parties.

Leicester want Cardiff's Fraizer Campbell but also want a tall striker who can dominate opposition defenders.

They had an interest in 6ft 5ins Lars Veldwijk of Excelsior but Cardozo would represent a ready-made player for the Premier League albeit stretching their budgeted resources. Lokomotiv Moscow and Rubin Kazan have also shown interest in Cardozo.

Nottingham Forest are understood to have made an offer for Veldwijk.

Australian A League side Perth Glory are showing an interest in former Millwall forward Andy Keogh.

The Republic of Ireland international is a free agent as his contract has ended at the New Den.

The 28-year-old finished the season on loan at Blackpool and scored some important goals against Nottingham Forest and Wigan that helped the Seasiders stay afloat in the Championship.

Perth are looking for a marquee signing to replace striker Shane Smeltz. The 32-year-old New Zealand international who scored against Italy in the last World Cup is leaving for rivals Sydney.

Perth boss Kenny Lowe, formerly a midfielder with Hartlepool and Birmingham, was in Cardiff at the weekend among coaches revalidating their Pro licence badges.

Manchester City are also looking to recruit for their Australian franchise Melbourne Heart with the likes of QPR and LA Galaxy target Frank Lampard already linked with a two year deal.

Newcastle's latest object of affection in France is Nampalys Mendy at Nice.

The 21-year-old midfielder left Monaco last summer and stayed in France despite tentative interest from Manchester United.

Newcastle scouts have watched several Nice games of late with Mendy continuing to impress during his 36 appearances.

Manager Alan Pardew has Montpellier's Remy Cabella and Lyon's Clement Grenier among his options for central midfield but is also keen to invest in players who have Premier League experience to help provide better stability in his squad.

Lille, meanwhile, want Mapou Yanga-Mwiba while QPR are pondering an offer for Steven Taylor.

Seydou Doumbia is still hoping for English clubs to follow up their interest in him. 

The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international has scored 20 goals in 24 games for CSKA Moscow including two against Manchester City in their Champions League tie in November. Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal all watched him and asked for reports yet the majority of enquiries to his agent Jean Bernard Beytrisson have come from Italian clubs.

Atletico Madrid also like him and have asked to be kept informed of any change in his situation but Doumbia's preference would be England. The snag is CSKA are looking for £18million.

Sheffield United and Huddersfield are hoping to persuade Yorkshire neighbours Halifax Town to part with goalscoring sensation Lee Gregory. Sportsmail has charted interest in the part-time electrician who scored 30 goals in the Conference last season only for Halifax to miss out on promotion in the play-offs to Cambridge United. Gregory has been watched by over ten clubs this season and is highly valued but is hoping a deal can be reached so he can finally get his crack at league football.

Orlando City are considering making an offer for Cowdenbeath striker Kane Hemmings after he impressed in a friendly against Roma on Friday. The 23-year-old, who is out of contract next month, was given permission to play at the eleventh hour by Cowdenbeath after travelling over to look at facilities. Coach Adrian Heath was suitably impressed as Hemmings held his own against top class opposition and was unlucky to have a brilliant goal chalked off for offside. Coventry City have also shown interest in recent weeks for the former Rangers frontman.
