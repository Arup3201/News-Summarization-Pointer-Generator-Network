Jimmy Anderson roared his approval, offered a little glare but resisted the urge to have words with  Ravindra Jadeja and then soaked up the adulation of his home crowd. It was the big moment of a huge bowling display from England.

The man MS Dhoni tried to get banned from this fourth Test had just trapped his nemesis lbw after a superb demonstration of swing bowling and India were on the ropes at 63 for six after winning the toss and batting.

They may have made something of a recovery to reach 152 all out and just about stayed in the game by dismissing Gary Ballance just before the close to leave England on 113 for three. But this was very much the home side’s day. 

In form: Stuart Broad salutes the crowd after taking six wickets during day on the fourth Test in Manchester

Great day at the office: Broad celebrates with team-mates after taking his sixth wicket, that of Pankaj Singh

De ja vu: The England bowler finished the day on remarkable figures having taken six wickets for 25 runs

No one more than Anderson, who was 
this week cleared of all charges over his Trent Bridge spat with Jadeja,
 even if he was ultimately overshadowed by strike partner Stuart Broad 
as England ran riot under cloudy Manchester skies.

Both
 Dhoni and Alastair Cook would have batted first on an Old Trafford 
pitch with pace and carry but it turned into an excellent toss to lose 
because of the excellence of one of the most prolific partnerships in 
English Test history.

It was
 Anderson and Broad who squandered perfect bowling conditions on the 
first morning at Lord’s where England went on to crash to a second Test 
defeat.

Yet since then the 
senior pair have displayed class and character to hit back at the Ageas 
Bowl and then gloriously on Thursday when, particularly in the first hour,
 they bowled with a pace, hostility and skill that was almost 
unplayable.

The sun-baked 
summer has not exactly made England feel at home but the arrival of this
 series in Manchester was always likely to bring the weather they have 
craved.

Brave stand: India captain MS Dhoni hit a defiant 71 as his team crumbled in their first innings

Looking up: Ravichandran Ashwin sends a ball high towards the boundary at Old Trafford

It was perfect weather for ducks on Thursday — a Test record six in one innings, in fact.

Half a dozen Pakistan batsmen failed to trouble the scorers against West Indies in 1980, while six South Africans (v India in 1996) and six Bangladeshis (v West Indies in 2002) suffered the same fate.

The record for a Test is 11 — most recently set by England and Sri Lanka at Leeds in July.

1. Vijay waddles off after nicking Anderson to Cook.

2. Kohli falls to Anderson.

3. Broad gets the plaudits after having Pujara caught at slip.

4. Anderson is jubilant after trapping Jadeja in front.

5. Kumar is castled after leaving a Broad delivery that nipped back.

6. Broad wraps things up by bowling Pankaj.

The stage may have 
been set but Anderson and Broad had to make the most of it, as they did 
in reducing India to a scarcely believable eight for four, all four 
wickets falling in 13 balls on the same score.

Anderson’s
 third over was a double wicket maiden as Murali Vijay and then Virat 
Kohli, again failing to live up to his lofty reputation, both fell 
without scoring with England’s slip fielding matching the brilliance of 
their bowling.

Gautam 
Gambhir, thrown in here at the expense of Shikhar Dhawan, and Cheteshwar
 Pujara were the other early victims, both falling to Broad, as India’s 
lowest score against England, 42 in 1974 at Lord’s, looked under threat.

That
 they did not plumb those depths was almost totally down to their 
captain, Dhoni displaying considerable guts to overcome the limitations 
of his technique against the moving ball and the numerous blows to his 
body.

Dhoni had seen India’s
 best batsman in this series, Ajinkya Rahane, fall to Chris Jordan 
before the moment that Anderson will cherish more than most of his 374 
Test victims.

He may have been exonerated by judge Gordon Lewis and the 
decision of ICC chief executive Dave Richardson not to contest the not 
guilty verdict but Anderson’s aggressive approach was still under the 
microscope here.

Cook had 
told him to carry on cursing but Anderson was noticeably quieter, even 
after trapping Jadeja with the perfect inswinger to the left-hander 
after setting him up with three outswingers.

Exceptional, highly skilled
 bowling.

That left Anderson
 just nine wickets behind Sir Ian Botham’s English Test wicket-taking 
record but he was unable to add to it because of Dhoni’s defiance and 
the fact that Broad then blew India away.

Broad
 needs an operation on his right knee but he did not look  hindered here
 as he recorded four wicket maidens and ended up with six for 25, his 
third-best Test haul.

By the time Dhoni became the fifth of his six 
victims, India’s captain had scored 71, with only Ravichandran Ashwin 
offering much support with a hard-hitting 40 on his return to the side.

India might have failed to reach three figures had Jordan and Chris 
Woakes been able to offer more penetrative support but they are making 
their way in Test cricket and it was understandable that England were 
unchanged.

India were just 
about able to hang on in there, with Sam Robson  failing to convince 
before losing his off stump to Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Cook giving it away
 with a poor pull shot against the lively newcomer Varun Aaron.

Ballance
 and Ian Bell were taking the Test away from India until Aaron struck in
 the last over — eight of the day’s allocation were lost because of 
woeful over-rates — to gain an lbw shout from Marais Erasmus who, along 
with Rod Tucker, had an excellent day.

Not
 nearly as good, though, as that of Broad and Anderson who have given 
England the perfect chance to dictate terms in this decisive Test.
