Gertrud Scholtz-Klink was chief of the Nazi bridal schools and trained women to become 'perfect' wives to SS men

A sinister set of rules for would-be wives of Nazis in the Third Reich has been discovered three quarters of a century later.

Several ‘bride schools’ were set up with the aim of providing the perfect partners for Adolf Hitler’s henchmen.

Regulations dictated that young women would be taught ‘washing, cooking, childcare and home design’ before they could walk up the aisle with the men who would staff death camps and rule conquered lands with an iron fist.

They were also instructed in social niceties – such as how to hold conversations at cocktail parties – and how to bring up their children worshipping not God or Jesus Christ, but Hitler.

‘This is participation in the resurrection path of our people,’ said Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, chief of the Nazi bride schools which began 75 years ago when the first was established on the island of Schwanenwerder in the Wannsee lake outside of Berlin.

Along with the rulebook found in the Federal Archive were certificates adorned with the Germanic ‘Tree of Life’ which were presented to young girls who passed the six-week course to marry their sweethearts in the SS, Hitler’s paramilitary defence force.

The bride schools were a collaboration between Scholtz-Klink and SS chief Heinrich Himmler, who was obsessed with German superiority over all races and the need for a ‘strong family life to create a strong, pure nation’.

Himmler signed a decree in 1936 
ordering all women who wanted to marry a member of the SS to participate
 in the special training courses.

Not only would they learn how to 
become ‘good wives’, but they would also ‘acquire special knowledge of 
race and genetics’.

Failure to comply meant refusal of the marriage 
certificate.

The documents show that the Nazis 
regarded women, above all else, as breeding machines and ‘sustainers of 
the race’, in the language of the schools.

Scholtz-Klink praised motherhood under
 the Nazis as ‘divine’ and in a speech to senior party leaders in 1935 
ranted: ‘You need us, you depend on us.

'We are into something good, we 
participate in the resurrection way of our people. Women must be the 
spiritual caregivers and the secret queens of our people, called upon by
 fate for this special task!’

But the doctrine of the bridal schools
 began to falter the bigger the toll the war took on the home front. 
With slave labour imports still not enough to plug the manpower gap left
 by men sent to fight Hitler’s war, Scholtz-Klink had to dream up a new 
ideal of womanhood – one less involved with babies and more about 
turning lathes and operating steel furnaces to turn out the material 
needed for the fighting man.

Scholtz-Klink was the highest ranking 
female Nazi in the history of the Third Reich. She ruthlessly followed 
the party line, disallowing any female with Jewish or gipsy blood, or 
mental illness or physcial deformity, from attending her bridal courses.

Intelligence files from the time report that Himmler could often be 
seen ‘sneaking’ around bride school gardens hoping to ‘catch glimpses of
 girls dancing’.

pneumonia aged 98 – a month before he was due to be sentenced for his 
part in sending 16,000 Jews to their deaths. Laszlo Csatary had been 
under house arrest for over a year in his native Hungary after being 
found guilty in his absence by a court in Slovakia. Prosecutors said he 
regularly beat and whipped interned Jews for no special reason, 
‘regardless of their sex, age or health’. 

The bridal candidates of the S.S. marriage academy had to swear certain things, including:
