Alan Pardew has admitted that he is worried about his family after fans on the street made their feelings known to the under-fire Newcastle boss.

The Magpies were beaten 1-0 at Stoke on Monday to leave them joint bottom of the Premier League and with just 19 points from a possible 75 since the turn of the year.

Pardew’s future has again been the subject of media scrutiny this week but owner Mike Ashley is standing by him.

Meanwhile, Sportsmail can reveal that televisions inside the training ground were turned off on Thursday when Sky Sports News did a live broadcast on Pardew’s position ahead of his weekly press conference.

The 53-year-old has been involved in ‘one or two interactions’ with disgruntled supporters on Tyneside this week, but concedes it is when that spills over and begins to affect those closest to him that he becomes concerned. 

‘My family and friends worry me a little bit, because it’s started going past football media at times,’ he said.

‘That’s not nice. But that makes me more determined and that’s just the make-up that I have. I don’t shy away from it. I’ve been out and about all week.

'I’ve been out in town and I will continue to do that. It’s important that my resilience is the strongest of anybody.

‘Yeah, I’ve had one or two interactions where fans have made their point and I’ve got no problem with that, that’s part of being a football manager.

‘I’ve also had two or three fans who are wishing me to come through it and I appreciate that as well.’

Pardew — whose winless side travel to Swansea on Saturday — is adamant that he will not walk away from Newcastle in the short term, although he did hint that failing to get a response from his players could change his resolve.

‘You have to understand that this is my business,’ he said. ‘I love this football club. The players are feeling a little bit of the stress and the heat that is upon them.

‘They are a young group and I need to help them. I will do that until such point where it comes that I can’t help them anymore.’

Ashley — who on Thursday increased his stake in Glasgow Rangers to almost nine per cent — flew in to witness the defeat at the Britannia Stadium and has spoken to Pardew since then.

‘The message is very much “how can we support you?”,’ revealed Pardew. ‘They (Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley) have been very solid and I appreciate that. 

'It’s getting lost in the wash a little bit that I’m here out of arrogance or Mike’s being stubborn about it to annoy people.

'We’re not. We’re just trying to get what is right for the team and it’s obvious that the team isn’t functioning very well at the moment.

‘But there is no lack of fight and that is something which is important. My message to the players this week is that there have been some harsh words on the training ground and that is where they’ll stay. We need a bit more.’

Meanwhile, Swansea boss Garry Monk has accused Sky Sports of having an agenda against Pardew during live coverage at Stoke. 

‘Every time there was a bad mistake or some sort of attack against Newcastle they’d pan to the manager and the chairman,’ Monk said.

‘It was a bit of a farce for me and I thought there was an agenda behind it. 

‘But Alan’s an experienced manager, he’s in a difficult moment and he’s been through the mill but he’s a very good manager. I know it’s the first time he’s been through this sort of thing but I think they’ll be fine.

‘He’s got a very talented squad of players and it’s a case of pulling together as quickly as possible and move on.

‘You have sympathy with all managers in those situations but with the players they have they’ll fight and scrap for every point and I think they’ll do well this season.’
