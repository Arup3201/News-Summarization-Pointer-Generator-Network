Hopes were high for the new Hello Kitty theme park aimed at Chinese fans when it opened its doors at the start of 2015 to a media frenzy.

But the £210 million theme park in east China’s Zhejiang province have so far been more than simply lack-lustre.

The theme park centred around the iconic character invented in 1974 is described as 'cheesy' and 'boring' by visitors, and a long detailed review by one internet blogger brands it 'a mess'.

Not quite Disneyland: The Hello Kitty theme park has attracted negative reviews despite its vast costs

A feature on English language website Smartshangai.com, pulls the theme park apart, with blogger Ian Louisell, describing it as having 'inconsistent branding, mediocre rides, and some of the most wretched food I've encountered in seven years in China.'

The article was picked up by many on Twitter, with Brian DeMare retweeting it alongside his reaction, 'Report on the new Hello Kitty park outside of Shanghai. In short, don't go.'

The theme park launched by Japanese company Sanrio, who created Hello Kitty in 1974, and entertainment design firm Hettema Group, California, is in Anji, an area known for its rich forests and natural scenery, but clearly not for its transport links. 

Hello Kitty Park will be China's first large scale amusement park scheduled to open to the public on New Year's day

The official site says a shuttle bus runs from the Anji County Bus Terminal to the park. 

But a reviewer on TripAdvisor called Nehow a visit to the theme park 'an arduous trek', pointing out that with no railway at Anji, visitors must find another way of getting to the Anji bus terminal.

'Even getting to the bus terminal is problematic in itself. To get there, you must first take a bus for an hour or so from Huzhou Station, the closest high-speed railway stop, or from a station in Hangzhou...travelers who are flying in from other parts of Asia are probably looking at a minimum two-night stay in China due to logistics alone.'

As for the food being served in the park based around the popular little white cat with the red bow, Louisell sums up, 'Worse than any train food you'll find in China, but five times as expensive.'

Despite the fanfare for the park, positive reviews have not been forthcoming ... yet

Not so great? One commenter calls the park, set in Anji, east China’s Zhejiang province a 'despicable project'

An anonymous commenter calls the park a 'despicable project', while various comments on Chinese site Livedoor.com include, 'cheesy' 'boring' 'paint smells fill the park' and say the prices of food and drink are 'stupidly high'.

The Hettema Group website describes the Hello Kitty Park as a ‘a very special home-away-from home for Hello Kitty and all her friends. Nestled within the green hills of Anji, China, Hello Kitty Park celebrates a region whose distinctive culture has grown up around the treasures of the natural world.'
