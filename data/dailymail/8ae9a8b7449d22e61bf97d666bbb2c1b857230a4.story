As ice storms battered Toronto before Christmas, hundreds of thousands of homeowners were left without power.

But one man beat the blackout after siphoning off electricity from his car in order to power his home.

Retired Air Force engineer Bob Osemlak used the battery in his Toyota Prius to heat his house, power his television and keep his lights on for a whole day on December 21.

Ice storms left hundreds of thousands without power for days in Toronto, except for one man who managed to power his home using electricity from his car

Using his three decades of experience as a mechanic working on aircraft and cars he ran a cable from an outlet he fitted to his fireplace, through his basement and into the window of the Prius.

Speaking to the Guelph Mercury, he said: 'When the furnace comes on, and the house gets up to temperature, I go to the thermostat and shut the furnace off.

'Now I can plug something else in: the TV, the fridge or the floor lamp.'

He added that by powering just the lights and TV, the traction battery should run for a long time.

Out of the nine hours he used the Prius the car's fuel gauge, measured in bars, went down by less than one bar — or roughly four litres' worth of petrol.

However he doesn't recommend that anyone else try the trick, as it can be incredibly dangerous for someone without his training.

The Toyota Prius is a hybrid car with two separate engines - one petrol, and one electric - and uses both a conventional fuel tank and a battery to power itself

According to his daughter Robyn, Osemlak has always been handy with cars, and in the 1960s while stationed in Winnipeg he invented his own automatic car starter to stop the cold damaging the engine.

The motor would run for ten minutes every hour in order to keep the car warm so the engine wouldn't make a grinding noise as it started.

However, Robyn added that she had no idea of her father's plans during the storm.

Osemlak says he plans to keep the car on a full charge in case the power goes out again.

The father added that he had driven a diesel Volkswagen for over a decade and only switched to a Prius a few years ago in the hope of getting better mileage.
