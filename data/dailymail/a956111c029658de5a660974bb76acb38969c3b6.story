Nigel Pearson has accepted an FA charge of using abusive language towards a supporter – and has requested a personal hearing.

The Leicester City manager was filmed appearing to tell a fan to ‘f*** off and die’ after being called an ‘utter t***’ during the defeat to Liverpool at the King Power Stadium on December 2.

Pearson will attend a hearing of his case before an Independent Regulatory Commission determine the scale of any punishment.

He faces a fine and/or touchline ban — although he already elects to sit in the stands during matches. His expletive-fuelled exchange came when he travelled to the dugout for the closing stages.

A previous FA statement read: ‘It is alleged that during the fixture Mr Pearson used abusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator.’

Pearson has been unrepentant over the incident. He has said: ‘I’m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation. If people were offended then that is regrettable but there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk.’
