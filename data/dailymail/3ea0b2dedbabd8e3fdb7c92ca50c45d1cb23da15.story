Movita Castaneda, the raven-haired actress who met Marlon Brando on a movie set and later married him and had two of his children, has died.

Barbara Sternig, a family friend, says Castaneda died last Thursday at a Los Angeles rehabilitation center after being treated for a neck injury. 

The Los Angeles Times says Castaneda was believed to be 98. There is debate as to what year she was born, as her age was inflated during her time as an actress.

She married Brando in 1960 and the two stayed together until 1962 when he fell in love with his costar while remaking 'Mutiny on the Bounty' - the very movie that made Castaneda a star. 

However, Brando and Castaneda later had a second child together in 1966.

In the film, Castaneda played a Tahitian named Tehani who marries a sailor.

The film was remade in 1962 with Brando, Castaneda's then-husband, playing Fletcher Christian.
