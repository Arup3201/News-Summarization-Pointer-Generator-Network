Daniel Sturridge has been ruled out of playing for Liverpool until 2015 after sustaining a thigh strain in training.

It continues a nightmare season for the 25-year-old who was finally fulfilling his potential on the pitch, only for two serious injuries to intervene.

In Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, he seems to have found a club and manager best suited to nurturing his undoubted talent.

Here, Sportsmail looks back at the striker’s career so far, a tale of promise and woe, which has seen him have spells at four different Premier League clubs.

Manchester City

Sturridge joined the Manchester City Academy aged 13, having earlier played at youth level for Aston Villa and Coventry City. 

He made his debut at 17, becoming the first player to score in an FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season, but his progress was soon curtailed by a hip injury. 

The club’s transfer budget was dramatically increased first by the takeover by former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and later Sheikh Mansour. Jo, Robinho, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Craig Bellamy were all brought in and Sturridge was by then resolved to leaving. 

After he left, he was criticised by one club source as being ‘too interested in fame and money’ but Jim Cassell, City’s former Academy Director, recalled in the Daily Telegraph a player with a ferocious drive to be the best he could be, at odds with his growing reputation as being a footballing mercenary.

Chelsea

Sturridge joined Chelsea in 2009 for an undisclosed fee and around £60,000 a week salary. 

He was characterised as a ‘nightmare behind the scenes,’ by one club insider and gained a reputation for being selfish on the pitch, although Sturridge has countered that this was never the case. His potential was never properly realised at Stamford Bridge. 

A succession of managers favoured established strikers, such as Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, and later the eye-wateringly expensive Fernando Torres. A six-month loan spell at Bolton in 2011, where he scored eight in 11 games, suggested he was stifled at Chelsea. 

Sturridge was even tried out as a winger by Andre Villas-Boas. He watched from the bench as Chelsea beat Bayern Munich to win the Champions League in 2012.

Liverpool

Sturridge has flourished on Merseyside, scoring, 32 goals in 46 appearances since joining the club in 2013. His partnership with Luis Suarez saw the club almost clinch the Premier League title last season. 

But when he signed, many – notably including Sir Alex Ferguson – thought he was too big a risk. Even Brendan Rodgers admitted that ‘If he wants to stay at this level, this is probably his last chance,’ when he was introducing him to the press. 

After finally finding a club where he is both praised and constructively criticized, he has shaken off the label of being selfish and hungry for fame and money. 

Sturridge is as important to Liverpool as they are to him and both will want him fit and scoring again.
