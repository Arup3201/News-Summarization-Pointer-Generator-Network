From suggestive remarks to wandering hands, Britain’s offices have long been home to the occasional oversexed boss.

These days, however, there is one big difference – the manager ogling junior staff may well be a she. 

And instead of harassing their female co-workers, men appear more likely than ever to be the ones being fondled or wolf-whistled at.

Power: Judi James claimed women bosses are now more likely than men to flout workplace etiquette - an issue famously portrayed by Demi Moore in the 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure

Experts say the trend is being fuelled by the growing number of women in positions of power – some of whom feel it is ‘payback time’. 

The issue was famously portrayed in 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure, in which Demi Moore plays a sex-hungry boss who pursues her male colleague, played by Michael Douglas – then sues him for harassment when he turns her down.

Yesterday, communication and body language specialist Judi James claimed women bosses are now more likely than men to flout workplace etiquette. 

She added that the thrill of being in charge affects their behaviour, with some viewing it as revenge for years of sexual inequality in the workplace. 

Others think nothing of touching a colleague’s bottom, she said, and believe male co-workers should be glad of the attention.

Pests: The issue has more recently been shown in the Horrible Bosses films - and is apparently on the increase, according to Miss James, who advised firms on office behaviour

Miss James, who advises firms on office behaviour, added: ‘If I go into a company and someone’s bum’s being mentioned, or pinched, or there’s noises or looks as they walk past, I’d say these days it’s more likely to be a woman boss.’ 

Horrible Bosses 2 is out on Blu-ray and DVD now.
