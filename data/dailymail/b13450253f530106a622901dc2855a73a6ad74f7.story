Golf is not usually regarded as an extreme sport but Spain's Pablo Larrazabal was given the scare of his life on the course in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.

Larrazabal was playing the 14th hole of his second round at the Maybank Malaysian Open when he was suddenly attacked by a swarm of giant hornets.

The 30-year-old from Barcelona was forced to flee from the angry swarm and, after failing to escape his attackers, dived into a lake and took cover under water in a desperate bid to shake off the insects, which he described as 'three times the size of bees'.

Escape: The Spaniard is helped out of the lake by his caddie - and thankfully the insects have gone

'I've never been so scared': The Spaniard dries off after his unexpected dip and admitted later he was terrifiedÂ 

'I've never been so scared,' admitted Larrazabal afterwards.

Larrazabal eventually emerged from the lake, dried off and received several injections to treat the 20 stings he suffered.

Incredibly, Larrazabal then resumed his round and he shot a remarkable score of 68 - four under par - which included two birdies after the terrifying incident.

'I hit my tee shot just right of the bunker and chipped it out quite well,' Larrazabal said of the incident, which occurred on the fifth hole 
at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club.

'So I'm walking along and suddenly I felt something on my nose. I swatted it away and suddenly...they were not bees, they were three times the size of bees.

Back off: Larrazabal ditched his shirt and jumped into the lake on the advice of other players

'They were huge and like 30 or 40 of them started to attack me big time. I didn't know what to do. My caddie told me to run, so I start running like a crazy guy, but the hornets were still there, so the other players told me to jump in the lake.

'So I ran to the lake, threw my scorecard down, took off my shoes and jumped into the lake. It was the scariest moment of my career, for sure. I've never been so scared.

'I had to throw my shirt and hat away, and the towel I'd been swatting them with. The referees and a doctor took me aside and gave me a couple of injections and told me to relax. After the injections I felt a lot better and could continue. Without the help of the referees I couldn't have finished the round, because I was in no state to play golf.

Happier times: Larrazabal in more regular action on Friday at Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club

No slouch: Larrazabal beat Rory McIlroy to win the Abu Dhabi Championship in January

Another dive: Larrazabal took the plunge into the water after winning the French Open in 2008

'Tomorrow it will be very, very scary to play that hole. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but hopefully I will play it as quickly as I can.'

Larrazabal, who won the Abu Dhabi Championship ahead of Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson in January, later added on Twitter: 'In my room resting after a long and tough day out there...Head still in pain but I will be 100 per cent and ready tomorrow to go for a low one...

'There are a lot of stories around the golf courses around the world but looks like I always have the crazy ones. Maybe I start to write a book.'

Lee Westwood took command of the tournament on Friday after adding
 a 66 to his opening 65 for a 13-under-par halfway total of 131, four 
shots ahead of Ryder Cup team-mate Nicolas Colsaerts and Antonio Lascuna
 of the Philippines.

Fairway to heaven: Italy's Matteo Manassero plays a shot on the picturesque course in Kuala Lumpur

But the 40-year-old's superb performance was somewhat overshadowed by the bizarre incident involving Larrazabal.

Larrazabal is 11 shots behind the Englishman and needs a miracle comeback to somehow claim glory this week. After this ordeal, that really would provide a sting in the tale.
