The star of a new BBC wildlife documentary has become inundated with marriage proposals after thousands of women have fallen head-over-heels for the man who has dedicated his life to saving baby kangaroos.

Chris Barnes runs a kangaroo orphanage in the Australian outback and is the subject of a documentary which aired in Britain over the past month.

The 6ft7in strapping Aussie won the hearts of women across the nation receiving 2,000 emails, including ten marriage proposals after he appeared in Kangaroo Dundee on BBC2.

Dashing Dundee: It's not hard to understand why Chris 'Brolga' Barnes has become a favorite with the British ladies as he nurses one of his joeys

Mr Barnes, who prefers to go by the 
name of Brolga, cares for orphaned joeys 24 hours-a-day, and has to take them with him wherever he goes - even to 
the supermarket.

His amazing story has been documented 
in the two-part series which follows his life in the outback, and he is shocked by the 
reactions from his legions of (female) fans.

Brolga, who lives in a shack with no 
running water or boiler near Alice Springs, said he was overwhelmed by the lovelorn notes from 
the UK  as well as the support for his sanctuary.

Since the airing of the documentary he has received an estimated £13,500 in donations towards the Kangaroo Rescue 
Sanctuary.

‘I’m just a bloke who lives on my own in the Outback in a tin shack with no power and no toilet,’ he told The Times.

Self-made man: Mr Barnes, who built his sanctuary by hand and dedicates 24 hours a day to the care of his kangaroos, has won the hearts of Britain - or at least its women

‘I talk to the critters more than I do
people. I have 100 galahs that come in for breakfast, so I chat to them
first thing in the morning, and then there’s my kangaroo family that I 
look after. So to think I’ve got all these fans in England, it’s hard 
to come to terms with.’

Kangaroo Dundee shows Brolga - an 
aboriginal word for stork - taking on three newly-orphaned and 
vulnerable babies: Amy, Daisy and William.

He has to care for the young marsupials as if he is their real mother, feeding them every four hours without fail.

Mr Barnes said:  'To live out here and
be part of the outback is all that is important to me. Just because I'm
a man, some people call me a kangaroo dad. I'm not. I'm a kangaroo mum.'

Mr Barnes, who is in his 40s, started 
his new life 20 years ago after rescuing three joeys and realising they 
couldn't go back to the wild.

He built his own sanctuary in the 
Outback, single-handedly digging a 2.5 mile long trench and fixing more 
than 4,000 metres of chain-mesh to 450 hand-hammered fence posts.

He said: 'I'm not a rich man, I never have been so I decided to try and raise a bit of money stacking shelves and washing buses.

'I spent two-and-a-half years working seven days a week to build the sanctuary in 45 degree heat.

'To live out here and be part of the outback is all that is important to me.'
