Genoveva Anonma is a woman who should be heralded for her footballing achievements, but instead the 27-year-old has had to face incredulous adversity for her successes in the beautiful game.

In 2008, she led her native Equatorial Guinea to their first-ever African Women's Championship.

Scoring the winning goal of the tournament's showpiece, in a 2-1 triumph against South Africa, Anonma's moment in the spotlight was immediately turned into darkness as questions arose about her gender.

Genoveva Anonma says she was once forced to strip naked to prove she was a woman by CAF 

'They asked me to take all my clothes off in front of officials from CAF and the Equatorial Guinea team,' the 2012 African Footballer of the Year said in an interview with BBC Sport.

'I was really upset, my morale was low and I was crying. It was totally humiliating, but over time I have got over it.'

Anonma's stark words were the result of the Confederation of African Football's (CAF) decision to choose one of the most derogatory methods to determine her gender.

That instance isn't the first time the talented footballer has had to face adversity from her peers. 

At the 2011 Women's World Cup, Anonma was embroiled in a scandal about her gender alongside her international team-mates, sisters Salimata and Bilguisa Simpore.

Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana accused the Guinea trio as men due to their physical attributes.

'You only need to have physical contact with them on the pitch to know this [that they are men],' said Ghana defender Diana Amkomah at the time.

Once more the 27-year-old slammed those allegations even offering to undergo medical gender testing in the expectation of silencing her doubters once and for all.

Anonma, who plays for German giants Turbine Potsdam, has never the chance to prove she has always been a female.

'I was hoping they would call me to tell me they were taking me to hospital to do tests, but they never did,' she added.

'They did nothing to me. It was just down to me alone to defend myself, to state that I am not a man, I am a woman.'
