British business guru Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones enjoyed the sweet smell of success as CEO of French cosmetic giant L'Oreal, but now feels the need to kick up a stink – over a chip stall that he says is ruining his Alpine ski holidays.

Sir Lindsay, a Welsh-born Oxford University graduate who stepped down as head of L'Oreal in 2006, wants a chip stall that operates outside his luxury chalet in the French resort of Val d'Isere shut down, claiming that it's an 'olfactory nuisance' and represents 'an abnormal disturbance'.

The stall is owned by Valerie Maertens, and her lawyer, Maitre Francois Bern, argued that his client's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman's 'precious nostrils'.

The case will be heard at Albertville court tomorrow - and is the fifth attempt by Sir Lindsay to have the stall closed.

His lawsuit argues that the stall, which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day, produces 'a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies', according to The Times.

What's more, it adds, the stall spoils the 'view and exceptional tranquillity' of the apartment, as there are 'numerous chairs… multi-coloured parasols, dustbins and vehicles' in front of it, the paper said.

However, Mr Bern retorted that multi-millionaire Sir Lindsay, whose former company makes world-famous scents, is engaging in 'judicial harassment' to protect nostrils accustomed only to inhaling fine aromas.

He added: 'This is a lawsuit brought by rich people who live in silk and comfort, who only inhale perfume and who want to stop this lady from living.'

When the matter went to court in 2012, Ms Maertens said: 'I'm angry and I feel persecuted. For rich people, it's certain that a chip stall in front of them is going to be annoying but us, we have to work for a living.

'They complain about the noise and the smell of chips, but if you want peace and quiet, you don't buy an apartment at the foot of the slopes.'

When Sir Lindsay took over L'Oreal's in the mid-1980s, annual sales were 3.7 billion dollars, and when he stood down they were 14.5 billion dollars.

Much of the success was based on brilliant marketing, including slogans like 'Because You're Worth it'.

As well as skiing, Sir Lindsay, who is now 68, is passionate about numerous sports including motor racing and sailing. He was knighted in 2005.
