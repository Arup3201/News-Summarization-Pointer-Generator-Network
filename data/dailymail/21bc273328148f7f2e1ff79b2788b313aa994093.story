A ‘bruised and defeated’ Jeannette Bougrab will not attend the funeral of her lover Charb – the slain editor of Charlie Hebdo.

Her decision comes after an extraordinary intervention by his family who denied the couple had any committed relationship and demanded she ceased speaking about him.

Charb’s brother, Laurent, issued the ‘one-off’ statement from the family on Saturday, following a series of emotional interviews given by the former minister of State.

Now Miss Bougrab – mother of an adopted three year old daughter May – says: ‘In the morning I was with his parents at the Forensic Institute to see the body of my companion.

‘But now I’ve agreed to remove myself and I will not go to his funeral. I do not have the strength to fight for that. I am bruised and defeated.

‘But they won’t take away my fight for secularism.’

Bitterly, Miss Bougrab said of her decision not to attend the funeral: “The family have deprived me of a last reunion with my love.

‘By doing that they’ve killed him a second time.’ 

Earlier, on hearing of the family’s terse denial, Bougrab phoned Paris Match to say: ‘Human nature is ugly. We loved each other because we were both independent personalities.

‘We didn’t do a press release to announce our relationship but we weren’t hiding it. He had met my mother, my daughter called him dad.’

Now she says they’d been involved for a year although earlier reports implied much longer. Several friends of the couple have since backed her claims of a relationship.

Bougarb, a 41 year old lawyer, quickly became the public face of France’s mourning soon after the killing of 12 people, mainly journalists, at the office of the satirical magazine.

Grief stricken, frequently in tears, she gave a series of emotional television interviews saying she knew he would be killed and describing how she begged him to leave France.

‘ My companion is dead because he drew in a newspaper.’

‘He never had children because he knew he was going to die. He lived without fear but he knew he would die.’

The former French Secretary for Youth and Community Life described to French TV station BMFTV how she got the news he was killed. ‘I was at a state meeting and I learned there had been a shooting.

‘Then I sent him a text, a second text, third text, and then I phoned him and he wasn’t answering and he never did that.

‘When I got there, there were the cordons and we weren’t allowed to get in and I learned there that he was dead.’

Anger: Miss Bougrab slammed the 'inadequate' security around the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying: 'We could have avoided this massacre'

Proudly, Bougrab added: ‘He died standing.

‘He defended secularism. He defended the spirit of Voltaire. ‘He, in fact, was really the fruit of this ideal of the Republic that we’ve almost forgotten.

‘He died, executed with his comrades, as he would say.’ 

Bougrab, a member of the French National Council of State who served under Nicolas Sarkozy’s administration has been described as a ‘hard secularist’.

The daughter of Algerian immigrants she is known as a fierce critic of religion, particularly of Islam.

She admitted herself that she and Charb were an unlikely pairing although she’d been fascinated by him before they met.

He was a communist, she a member of UMP, the centre right party.

‘I have lost my love, lost a part of me. I was with a hero I admired. We tried to live normally but it was complicated.’

Harsh truth: Jeannette Bougrab said of the 'Je Suis Charlie' movement: 'I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life'

Hitting out at the inadequate security given to the satirical magazine and its staff, she later told TF1: ‘I haven’t lost Charlie Hebdo. I’ve lost a loved one. I am here not as a former government minister, but as a woman who has lost her man, who has been murdered by barbarians.

‘I admired him before I fell in love with him and I loved him because of the way he was, because he was brave. He thought that life was a small thing when he was defending his ideals.

‘Do you know people capable of dying for their ideas today? No. Because they’ve just died, they’ve just been murdered. That’s the reality, we could have avoided this massacre. We could have avoided it and we didn’t.’

Asked if she had been comforted by the world’s adoption of the ‘Je Suis Charlie’ symbol and that it could be seen as a sign of victory, of hope, Bougrab said passionately:

‘Absolutely not, because he’s dead. It’s absolutely not a victory. It’s a defeat. It’s a tragedy for our country and I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life.’

Now she would like to see all the murdered cartoonists buried in the Parthenon where Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau lie.

‘They died defending freedom of expression, secularism. They died so we can stay free in this country in France in 2015.’
