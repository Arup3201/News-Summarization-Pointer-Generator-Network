Father-of-one Lee Lewis, 22, was killed when he crashed his stolen car during a 12-mile police chase by 'untrained officers'

The family of a joyrider who was killed in a police chase have been awarded £20,000 in compensation.

Father-of-one Lee Lewis, 22, suffered multiple injuries when his stolen car hit a wall during a 12-mile chase by four police cars in Port Talbot, south Wales.

The five 'untrained' officers who gave chase had ignored orders from the police control room to stop the pursuit.

They were given written warnings after an investigation into the fatal crash.

Lewis' family have now been given £20,000 compensation - awarded to his seven-year-old son Iestyn.

They were awarded an out-of-court settlement after a putting in a civil claim for negligence against South Wales Police.

Lewis,
who had just become a father at the time of the crash, died after 
taking a Ford Fiesta from a street in Swansea in May 2008.

He crashed into the stone wall after leading the two police cars and two vans at speeds of up to 87mph.

Lewis' grandfather Peter Howells today slammed the way the case had been dealt by the police force.

He said: 'He was a young man, he had a young baby, and it's ruined our lives.

'These officers didn't even get a speeding fine, they've had nothing, just a slap on the wrist - this isn't justice.'

Five officers were given written warnings for misconduct after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission

South Wales Police yesterday claimed lessons had been learned from the incident.

Alun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, said: 'Having reviewed the case with senior officers I am satisfied with the thoroughness of the investigation.

'I feel great sympathy for the family of Lee Lewis.

'While I understand the family's position, I can see no grounds for further action in this case.'

The compensation payout was slated today by the TaxPayers' Alliance.

Campaign manager Robert Oxley said: 'It is a tragedy that a man has lost his life but that does not justify this outcome.

'It was the joyrider who put his and other people's lives at risk.

'The police must review their decisions that day but this does not justify a taxpayer funded compensation payment for an accident that was a result an individual's actions, not others.'

South Wales Police agreed to pay the £20,000 compensation even though Lewis was not wearing a seatbelt when he crashed during the chase.

Lewis died 12 days after the crash in Morriston Hospital, Swansea, in May 2008, after developing blood poisoning.

Five officers were given written warnings for misconduct in 2009 after disobeying orders from their control room to stop pursuing Mr Lewis.

It concluded they had committed disciplinary offences by disobeying orders from their control room to stop pursuing Mr Lewis, who had been seen driving without lights.

The IPCC investigation concluded that none of the officers were qualified to take part in pursuit driving and that some had denied understanding the meaning of the term 'stand down'.

They were found to have given inaccurate information about their speeds until 'black box" recorder devices from their vehicles established they were doing nearly 90mph at times.

IPCC Commissioner for Wales Tom Davies said: 'The police pursuit was conducted by four drivers who were not pursuit trained.

'During some stages of the pursuit there were four police vehicles in a convoy travelling at speeds of up to 87 MPH on roads that had a 60mph limit.

'This included two police cars and two police vans, one of which was a dog handler's van.

'When the officers were interviewed by the IPCC they were unable to recall travelling at excess speeds or that they were ordered to stop the pursuit but continued.

'The public perception of a police officer is an individual who gives reliable and accurate evidence.

'During the course of our investigation it has been disappointing that the officers actively involved in the incident found it difficult to recall distances, speeds and the actions of others.'
