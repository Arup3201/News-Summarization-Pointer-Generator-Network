Red carpet favourite Emma Stone has landed the cover of Vogue's 2012 Best Dressed issue.

The Amazing Spiderman star, 24, is joined by actresses Rooney Mara, Kristen Stewart, Leelee Sobieski and Zoe Saldana in the style bible's prestigious annual round-up.

Beyonce Knowles' younger sister Solange also made the cut, as did Ernest Hemingway's model granddaughter, Dree.

One of Vogue's own, contributing 
editor and socialite Lauren Santo Domingo, featured in the list too, as 
did fashion-forward NBA wife Kimberly Chandler.

Rounding out the ten names was model 
Lily Kwong, perhaps a less familiar face, but after this high-profile 
recognition, she is unlikely to be for long.

The special issue is themed around 'Style Across America', and all women in the best-dressed list were born in the U.S.

'Whether in 
Converse or floor-skimming Â­Oscar de la Renta, these ten show that 
though the American style icon has evolved,' the magazine reads.

'The pluck and poise of the 
countryâ€™s women remain as strong as ever.'

The issue also celebrates the world's newest style stars - a list of up-and-coming names that promise to feature prominently in best dressed lists of the future.

Among them are actress Shailene Woodley, Azealia Banks, Lana Del Rey and Jennifer Lawrence.

It also includes Elizabeth Olsen, now putting her famous sisters in the shade thanks to a 'modern take on seventies glamour in a way that is both covetable and accessible'.
