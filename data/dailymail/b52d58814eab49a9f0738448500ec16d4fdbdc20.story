Forget the Top Of The Rock or the Empire State. The best views of New York City are from the air - as five Red Bull Air Force wingsuit flyers reveal in this video.

The incredible footage shows the daredevils skydiving above one of the world's most recognised skylines - Manhattan - after taking the plunge from an plane 7,500ft above the Hudson River.

But, like real pros, the team don't even pause to give it a second thought as they leap from the plane and hurtle at 120mph towards a barge with a landing pad which is waiting for them on the river.

Now that's a view: Four members of the Red Bull Air Force did their best impersonation of Superman, wearing wingsuits and buzzing the skyline at 120 mph

The plunge from a plane 7,500ft above the city was part of the 2014 Bethpage Air Show in Long Island

Despite the narrow landing pad, the flyers avoid a dunking in the river by expertly swooping down on the barge using their parachutes to slow them down.

The flight, which was part of the 2014 Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach in Long Island, started over Manhattan's financial district before heading uptown, passing the skyscrapers of the Financial District.

The troop was made up of wingsuit flyers Jon Devore, Jeff Provenzano, Amy Chmelecki, Sean MacCormac and Andy Farrington are part of the Red Bull Air Force (RBAF).

The crew started at the southern tip of Manhattan, above the Financial District, and flew west over the island

The gliders flew between the buildings and landed safely on a barge on the Hudson River

'Being
 from New York, this is so special and I’ve been dreaming about this 
since I was a kid,' said Provenzano, who grew up just north of the city.

'It’s been years of looking up at the big buildings and wondering if there is a day that I can fly over them.

'That day was today.'
