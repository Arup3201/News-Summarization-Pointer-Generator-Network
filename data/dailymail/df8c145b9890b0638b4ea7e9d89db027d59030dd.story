A man walks into a pet shop... and a comedy classic is born.

Monty Python’s Dead Parrot sketch has been voted the troupe’s greatest piece of all time.

A man buys a dead parrot and takes it back to complain - only to discover the pet shop owner refuses to admit there is anything wrong with the bird.

It hardly sounds funny, but performed by John Cleese and Michael Palin it is regarded by Monty Python fans as one of the greatest comedy sketches of all time.

And it appears the nation agrees.

The sketch - first aired almost 45 years ago on December 7, 1969 has topped a poll of 2,000 British adults.

People were asked to select their top sketch from a long list of more than 35 Python scenes.

The pet shop scene, which features Cleese as an exasperated customer trying to get his money back from Palin, who is a stubborn pet salesman, was voted the most popular Python moment by 45 per cent.

Second place with 28 per cent went to The Lumberjack Song, which was released as a single in 1975, while the top three was completed by The Ministry of Silly Walks (23 per cent) – a sketch which sees Cleese striding in and out of meetings in a series of government-approved walks.

The troupe are currently on stage for their Monty Python Live (Mostly) reunion at London’s O2 arena. The survey has been commissioned to tie in with the last show which will be screened on TV channel Gold on Sunday July 20th.

The findings also reveal some regional differences with Londoners the most likely to find Monty Python funny (81 per cent), compared to those in the North East (69 per cent).

There was a surge of popularity for the Dead Parrot sketch in the East Midlands with more than half (55 per cent) voting it their top Python moment, compared to the national average of 45 per cent.

The Lumberjack Song was particularly popular in Northern Ireland (33 per cent) and Scotland (34 per cent), compared to the national average of 28 per cent.

Those living in East Anglia (28 per cent) and Wales (27 per cent) were particularly tickled by The Ministry for Silly Walks, compared to the national average of 23 per cent.

The Monty Python troupe announced last November they were reuniting for a one-off stage show, but after tickets quickly sold out an extra nine dates were added.

It is the first time in 40 years that members John Cleese, 74, Terry Gilliam, 73, Eric Idle, 71, Terry Jones, 72, and Michael Palin have appeared together on a UK stage.

Palin, 71,  has said the July 20 show will be the last time the five stars work together, adding there were 'absolutely no plans to do any more shows after that'.
