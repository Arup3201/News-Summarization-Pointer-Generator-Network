The race-row that has engulfed Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg intensified further today as two Chelsea players claimed they heard him call teammate John Obi Mikel a 'monkey'.

It has emerged that the pair of unnamed stars say this is what happened during their match with Manchester United on Sunday - but the official categorically denies making any racist comments.

Clattenburg has been accused of saying to Mikel: 'Shut up you monkey' as he booked him for dissent as well as calling Juan Mata a ‘Spanish t***’ in their 3-2 defeat at Stamford Bridge.

Row: Chelsea teammates say John Obi Mikel was told to 'shut up you monkey' by referee Mark Clattenburg - a claim he vehemently denies

Shocked: Juan Mata is unhappy with Clattenburg's alleged insult - the experienced referee is accused of calling him a 'Spanish t***'

Mystery had surrounded what Clattenburg actually said to Mikel - until these allegations were made this morning.

But a source close to the referee told The Sun: 'He said nothing of the sort - and he will fight this all the way.

'There is a lot of noise on the pitch and the players could have easily misheard.'

Meanwhile, Chelsea's race case against 
Clattenburg is in serious danger of collapsing completely after it emerged that the club 
have employed independent lawyers to investigate the claims of their 
players.

The club are expected to conclude 
their internal investigation into allegations that the referee racially 
abused John Mikel Obi and swore at Juan Mata.

The external lawyers will then 
provide Chelsea with legal opinion as to whether their case will be 
successful. Despite issues over the available evidence, Chelsea remained
robust.

Clattenburg, who has been taken off 
the Premier League match list this weekend, has protested his innocence 
since his controversial handling of Chelsea’s 3-2 defeat by Manchester 
United on Sunday.

Serbian police have charged two England footballers with 'violence' following an under-21 international between England and Serbia that led to ugly scenes.

No charges were levelled against Serbian fans making racist chants at England players or for causing a brawl.

Kevin Miles of the Football Supporters' Federations said the 'racial abuse of England players was disgraceful' and he called on Serbia to deal with those responsible with 'vigour'.

A further two officials from Stuart Pearce's backroom staff were also said to have been charged after the match erupted following the final whistle.

'Further to the Serbian police announcement regarding charging English Under-21 players and staff, the Football Association can confirm it has not received any formal notification of any charges filed,' the FA said.

Players and officials from both teams clashed on the pitch after Connor Wickham's late goal secured England's passage to next year's finals.

The unsavoury scenes were played out amid allegations of racist chanting from the stands directed at England Under-21 full-back Danny Rose.

Video footage appeared to reveal the crowd targeting Rose, who was red-carded after the whistle, and who has subsequently complained about the treatment he received.

Now it has emerged that Chelsea are 
fearful of the backlash if the players have misheard or misjudged 
Clattenburg’s conversations during the stormy clash against United.

Chelsea will proceed with the case 
against the referee only if they are satisfied the claims made by the 
players after the game will stand up to the FA’s burden of proof.

It means they will
need to satisfy an FA commission ‘on the balance of probability’, but 
they also have to negotiate the complexities of the Metropolitan 
Police’s investigation into the affair.

If the case breaks down, it will 
reflect badly on Chelsea, who made their claims of inappropriate 
language against Clattenburg in a strongly worded statement on Sunday, 
two hours after the final whistle.

Earlier it emerged that the club and 
Mikel could be charged with misconduct by the FA after the midfielder 
had to be restrained from manhandling the referee in his dressing room 
following the clash.

Clattenburg did not mention the 
behaviour in the ‘extraordinary incident’ report he filed on Sunday, but
he now has to make a detailed statement to the FA. Clattenburg’s 
assistants, Michael McDonough and Simon Long, and fourth official Mike 
Jones have filed reports in which they say they did not hear the Durham 
official say anything inappropriate.

All four were in the referee’s room when Mikel burst in with Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay and manager Roberto Di Matteo.

Mikel’s aggressive manner, along with
the behaviour of other Chelsea officials, raises the possibility of FA 
action against the club.

Both Mikel and Mata claim they have a
witness to Clattenburg’s comments, and PFA chief executive Gordon 
Taylor, who has assessed both complaints, told Sportsmail the
pair have his ‘100 per cent support’.

However, it has emerged that the 
allegations about the referee’s comments were made only after a debate 
in the Chelsea dressing room. Mikel and Ramires were discussing the 
alleged use of racist language and were then quizzed by senior Chelsea 
players about what they had heard before the matter was taken further.

Sunday’s controversy is also the 
subject of a police investigation and Clattenburg will be interviewed by
them as well as the FA, who are conducting a separate inquiry into his 
handling of the clash.

The PFA had a delegate at the game 
and he has discussed the matter with Taylor, who said: ‘The main thing 
is that the police investigation will not affect the process at the FA.

‘We are supportive of the players and
they have our 100 per cent backing. I find it difficult to believe that
Chelsea’s players would make something like this up. At the same time I
find it hard to conclude that a referee could say something of this 
nature.’

Clattenburg found an unlikely ally in
Leeds manager Neil Warnock, who said he was disgusted with Chelsea for 
‘trying to kill’ the official.

Warnock, preparing for Leeds’ Capital
One Cup win over Southampton last night, was critical of the 
accusations against Clattenburg, who enraged Chelsea by sending off 
Fernando Torres for diving when replays showed he had been fouled.

Warnock said: ‘You know my 
relationship with referees but I have to say I am disgusted with what’s 
gone on. I’m on Clattenburg’s side. We ask referees to man-manage and 
that’s what he does. I’m sure he might have said a few things but are 
you telling me if Chelsea had won that game that there would have been 
one iota of a complaint?

‘I hope if it is proved wrong, that 
the players, whatever they alleged Mark to have said, get done as well. I
think he made a mistake but they are trying to kill him and I don’t 
agree with that.’

In a further development, police 
chiefs upgraded security at Stamford Bridge for the Capital One Cup tie 
against United as tension between the teams threatens to escalate.
