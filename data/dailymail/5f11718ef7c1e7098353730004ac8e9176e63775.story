The problem of foreign fighters taking up arms alongside the ISIS terror army is growing, according to a senior member of Congress, and more than 150 Americans are now among them.

ISIS operates a 'virtual caliphate' online, California Republican Rep. Ed Royce said Thursday, recruiting foreigners at an 'unprecedented rate.' 

'Some 20,000 foreign fighters from more than 90 countries now make up its ranks' including at least 3,400 from the West and more than 150 Americans,' Royce said during a hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which he chairs.

ISIS 'occupies territory the size of Great Britain, holds an estimated $2 billion in assets, and is believed to be the most well-funded terror group in history.' he warned.

On Wednesday in a separate hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee, FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinback said the U.S. hasn't been able to keep track of all the Americans who might be going overseas with the intention of helping ISIS.

'We don't have it under control,' Steinbeck said.

'If I were to say that we had it under control, then I would say I know of every single individual traveling. I don't. And I don't know every person there and I don't know everyone coming back. So it's not even close to being under control.'

Even more troubling, he said Wedneday, is the possibility of Americans returning from their time alongside ISIS with the motive of attacking U.S. targets.

'Certainly I would not be truthful if I told you we know about all the returnees,' he said. 'We know what we know. There is a number that we don't know about.' 

An exasperated Texas Republican Rep. Mike McCaul, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, later said of ISIS that 'they're barbarians. And I think the barbarians are at the gate. But we want to keep them outside the gate of the United States.'

Douglas McCain was 33. He converted to Islam from Christianity, later adopting an identity on Facebook as 'Duale ThaslaveofAllah.' His Twitter biography read: 'It’s Islam over everything.'

At least 15 Somali-Americans from Minnesota have also been lured to Syria and Iraw to fight with the murderous jihadi group.

Abdirahmaan Muhumed told Minnesota Public Radio in June 2014 that he was fighting for ISIS when it captured the Iraqi cities of Mosul and Tikrit.

ISIS's terrorist ranks now include thousands of foreigners who have streamed into Syria and Iraq from nearly 100 countries

'A Muslim has to stand up for (what's) right,' the 29-year-old wrote on Facebook last year. 'I give up this worldly life for Allah.'

Muhumed told the radio network that he and ISIS are 'rying to bring back the khilaafa' – the caliphate, or Islamic empire. He also said 'Allah loves those who fight for his cause.'

Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told McCaul's committee that more than 20,000 foreign fighters overall, from more than 90 countries, have joined with ISIS on the battlefield.

'The rate of foreign fighter travel to Syria is unprecedented," Rasmussen warned. 'It exceeds the rate of travelers who went to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen or Somalia at any point in the last 20 years.'

Congress is gearing up for an intense debate over a new war powers resolution intended to give the White House legal backing for expanded military role in fighting the organization.

President Barack Obama sent his proposed language for an Authorization for Use of Military Force to Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

'Now he needs to make the case to the American people,' Royce said, calling for 'bipartisan backing behind a proposal that ensures that the Commander-in-Chief has the authority needed to decisively defeat this enemy.'

'But congressional authority is of no value if the president isn’t willing to act decisively.'
