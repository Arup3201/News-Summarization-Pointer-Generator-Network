There was laughter, can-can lines and even the odd bouncer as Australia started their preparations for the four-Test series against India.

Training together for the first time since Phillip Hughes' tragic death, the Test squad maintained a front of normality on Friday in the South Australian capital, Adelaide. 

Tuesday is not only the opening day of the series, but the first time Hughes' team mates will play after their beloved mate was felled at the Sydney Cricket Ground, on day one of a Sheffield Shield round between South Australia and New South Wales.

The full impact of Hughes' shock death, after he was fatally struck by a bouncer, on not only the Australian cricket team but also on the game is yet to be seen.

Australia coach Darren Lehmann reaffirmed that players will be given time to decide whether they're mentally up to playing at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.

But the early signs suggest the fear of mass withdrawals was unfounded.

The Australian cricketers showed incredible good humour, partaking in routine hijinks and questionable dance moves as players warmed up at a suburban oval on the fringes of the Adelaide CBD.

Kick-ups came first, with the standard debate over who was at fault when the soccer ball hit the ground.

It was only days earlier that the nation watched a clip at Phillip Hughes' funeral, broadcast on national television, which showed archive footage of the talented youngster playing the very same game alongside his team mates.

The players were photographed playing 'kick-ups'. At his Wednesday funeral, Phillip Hughes was shown in archive footage playing the same game as he laughed with his team mates

Fielding drills were next, the four fast bowlers breaking away to one group.

They laughed with Peter Siddle when the Victorian overshot the mark with his return, the ball skidding along the car park and bumping a vehicle.

Then came the serious business.

David Warner was among the first batsmen to shuffle into the nets.

David Warner took to the nets during Friday's training session. The opening batsman was incredibly close to Hughes and did not leave his side on the field after he was struck during the Sheffield Shield match

Steve Smith also took to the nets and was exposed to fast balls and bouncers as the bowlers appeared to train in their typical fashion in a remarkably normal session

Siddle, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson looked to regain rhythm in a centre-wicket session.

Even then, spirits remained remarkably high.

Chief selector Rod Marsh helped set the tone.

Marsh grabbed a baseball mitt and reprised his wicketkeeping days for a short time before being replaced by fielding coach Greg Blewett.

Both Marsh and Blewett understandably struggled to read the pacemen's deliveries.

The bouncer slowly came into fashion, although Johnson bowled a fuller length for most of the session.

Hazlewood fired one in that flew over Shaun Marsh's head, but it was Siddle that truly stepped up.

He sent down a terrific short ball, Marsh quickly ducking under.

Chris Rogers was not so lucky, a rising delivery from Siddle inflicting some serious pain when it thumped his body.

It was remarkably normal.

Five days of Test cricket is obviously a significantly different proposition to a run in the park.

The Australian cricket coach, affectionately known as 'Boof', is confident that the boys are back in business.

'I reckon you'll get a pretty good indication of how they're going today,' Lehmann said prior to training.

'(The squad is) getting on with what we do well and that's play cricket.'

Spirits were high, with plenty of antics, laughters, games and questionable dancing
