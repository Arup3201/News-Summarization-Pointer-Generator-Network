Trains on wedding dresses are often long and normally require a couple of bridesmaids to keep them in place.

But this bride takes things to a whole new level.

The 17-year-old model named Emma was pictured showcasing the 1.85-mile long train now regarded as the world's longest.

The ivory train billowed out over a main boulevard in Romania's capital Bucharest as she rose over the city in a hot air balloon.

The Guinness Book of World Records declared the item on the silk and lace gown as the longest train, beating the previous record held by a Dutch designer.

But pedestrians didn't seem to make much of today's event, which was organised by the artifact's creators, the Andree Salon fashion house and the organisers of this year's biannual Wedding Fair in Bucharest.

A few bystanders looked up at the balloon, but many others ignored it.

The 2,750 metre long train broke a previous record of 2,488 metres. It took 100 days to make

The train was crafted by a team of 10 seamstresses and was modelled by Emma, 17, pictured

The train, which took 100 days to create, was crafted by a team of 10 seamstresses, said salon spokeswoman Lavinia Lascae.

The lace was imported from France, while taffeta and other fabrics were purchased from Italy, costing several thousand pounds, she added.

Beating a Dutch designer to the record had an added dimension for Romanians, as many are still angry after the Netherlands opposed its entry into the European Union's visa-free travel zone.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte recently demanded that Romania and Bulgaria do more to reform their justice systems and combat corruption and organised crime before he would support integration.

Alin Caraman, an organiser of the Wedding Fair, said: 'If the Netherlands does not allow us into Europe, we'll take them out of the world records book'.
