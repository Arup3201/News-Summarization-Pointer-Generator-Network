A toddler has died after falling four storeys from a block of flats when she climbed out through a window.

Muna Mohamed, who was just 18 months old and had just learned to walk, is believed to have fallen from the kitchen of her home after climbing onto a breakfast bar.

Neighbours today described the moment the young girl fell to her death from her window.

Neighbours described hearing the Muna's mother Layla scream before she ran down the stairs to find her daughter where she had landed on the gravel.

Tragedy: The little girl, named by neighbours as 18-month-old Muna, fell to her death from an open window at her family's fourth floor flat in Bristol

Paramedics
fought to save Muna outside the council-owned block in Windmill Hill, 
where she lived with her mother, her father Abdirasaq, and her 
five-year-old brother Mohamed, but she later died at Bristol Children's 
Hospital.

Her parents, who are Muslim, are believed to 
have been up before sunrise to eat breakfast before observing the 
Ramadan fast when the tragedy unfolded early on Monday morning.

The family's neighbour Abdul Elmi, 
39, said Muna, who was just learning to walk, had climbed onto a 
chair then on to the table before falling out the window.

Mr
Elmi, who lives on the sixth floor and was friendly with the family, 
who hail from the same part of North Somalia, said: 'They were a nice 
family and from the same tribe as us - called Issaq.

'My wife goes to speak to the mum of the family a lot.

'The little girl was a cute little girl and a pudgy little thing who was always by her mother's side.

'My wife heard they were sleeping and
the little girl, she always stays with her mum, but this time she is 
starting to learn how to move around and she climbed up a little chair 
and table by the window and fell out.

'They are Muslims it is Ramadan. I 
don't know what they were doing some people get up and have breakfast 
and then go back to bed, but some people don't. It is very sad.

'I'm very frightened for my family now - that could have been one of my daughters,' Mr Elmi said.

Sorrow: Flowers and cuddly toys were tied to the railings outside the flats in Windmill Hill in the wake of the child's tragic death

Shock: It is thought the little girl's family were up early on Monday to eat breakfast before sunrise ahead of observing the Ramadan fast

His wife Ayan, 29, said she often visited Muna's mother with her daughters, aged nine, five and four, and three-year-old son.

She said: 'When we looked out the window and saw there was a lot going on I had no idea that it was my friend's little girl.

'I went down to knock on the door and there were a lot of police around.

'Muna was a beautiful little girl - very lovely.

'She would always sit next to her mum - she was very content. We are sad about what happened.'

Another neighbour, Paul Sheppard, 40, said: 'It’s so sad - a big shock. Everyone in the flats is cut up about it. She was a lovely little girl.

'On Monday morning I heard her mum scream, then she ran out to get downstairs as fast as she could. The police were round here straight away.'

Shock: Horrified neighbours living in the building told of their fears for their own children

Sarah O’Driscoll, 28, who lives on the floor below with her seven-year-old son Mitchell, said: 'It’s really scary.

'Having kids, it makes you realise living in flats like this you need to watch them all the time.

'I mean it has been so hot that everyone has had there windows open, you just would never think that kind of thing would happen.

'My son’s seven now, and even though he’s a bit older it still scares and panics me when I can’t see him.

'On the morning it happened I could see the police and paramedics outside but I didn’t know what was going on at first. It’s so tragic.

'I put a teddy out at the tributes because we are all one community here. We are all the same block so it just makes you think. It has been so quiet here since. I think everyone is in shock.

'A member of the family told my sister that the parents, obviously, are in shock. He said the parents took it really bad. It is just so sad.'

In mourning: Paramedics fought to save the toddler but she later died at Bristol Children's Hospital

An Eeyore teddy was tied to the railings near where Muna fell, as well as a rabbit teddy with the words 'bless you my little one' scrawled on the label.

Another card taped to flowers said: 'To a little angel who was taken young and suddenly, may you rest in peace.'

Another said: 'My heart goes out to the family on the tragic loss of their little girl. RIP little angel.'

A South Western Ambulance Service spokeswoman confirmed they were called at 6.54am to reports that a young girl had fallen from a balcony.

She was conscious and breathing at one point but had suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Bristol Children’s Hospital.

Avon and Somerset police spokesman Wayne Baker said the girl died later in the day and because investigations found no suspicious circumstances, the case has been referred to the Avon Coroner.

The coroner’s office confirmed that a file on the death had been referred to them, but said that an inquest had not yet been opened.
