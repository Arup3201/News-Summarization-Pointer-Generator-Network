Bigger is better when it comes to selling bras because according to new market research, women are more likely to buy lingerie if it's modeled by a plus-size woman over a thin blonde.

Adore Me, a rapidly growing lingerie start-up based in New York, has revealed that its television ad featuring a plus size model quadrupled online sales when compared to the brand's commercial starring a group of blondes.

'There's an overall mentality that you have to be super skinny,' the company's founder Morgan Hermand-Waiche told CNN. 'We are showing that we offer lingerie for everyone.'

Betty versus Veronica: Online retailer Adore Me has revealed that new research shows that its television ad starring a plus size brunette sold more lingerie that its commercial featuring a group of blondes 

The three-year-old start-up, which sells its lingerie and swimwear through monthly subscriptions, as well as one-off purchases, used a marketing strategy called A/B testing, in which consumers are shown different ads in order to measure what models, poses and settings increase the retailer's sales. 

When Adore Me debuted its first national television campaign last January, the company used the  testing method for its three different commercials, which aired on channels such as Bravo, Lifetime and MTV.

One television ad featured a cast of all blonde models, another showcased all brunette models and the third starred one plus-size brunette. 

After the company monitored online traffic and sales throughout the month, they came to the -perhaps surprising conclusion - that the 30-second commercial featuring the dark-haired plus-size model generated four times as many sales than the one featuring the blondes.

Foolproof method: The company's founder Morgan Hermand-Waiche told CNN's Rachel Crane that he relies on customer research to build his company's website 

Even better news for the thriving company is that the plus size clip only cost one-tenth of the other commercials' production expenses to make.

The online retailer also learned that its female consumers preferred the commercial that left its models unretouched.

Adore Me didn't do any digital retouching to the ad featuring multiple brunette models - and that commercial was the one that was favorited by consumers.

A/B testing is an important strategy for the company, which unveils a new collection every month. 

Blondes don't sell: Last year's research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a flaxen haired beauty

Coveted curves: This year's data revealed that women prefer model to remain digitally untouched 

Last year's marketing research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a blonde. 

Keeping that information in mind, the company wasn't surprised when its commercials featuring brunette models fared better than the ones that starred blondes during this year's round of testing.

'At the end of the day... it's [our] customers who choose the model they like [and] the pose they like instead of us imposing on them,' Mr Hermand-Waiche told CNN's Rachel Crane. 

'Its really the customer who builds the [Adore Me] website based on what they prefer,' he noted.
