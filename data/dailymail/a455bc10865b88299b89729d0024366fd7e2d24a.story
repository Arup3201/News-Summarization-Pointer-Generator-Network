Howard Webb tipped Nicola Rizzoli to be appointed as the final referee two weeks ago.

The camp has been affected by politics all tournament and being connected to the right people helps. So does being a good referee and Rizzoli ticks that box.

He has experience with both teams, having refereed Argentina twice in these finals and Bayern Munich’s Champions League knockout win over Arsenal last season.

In charge: Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli will referee Sunday's World Cup final between Argentina and Germany

Final: Lionel Messi and Argentina will face Germany at the Maracana on Sunday for the World Cup

Bayern, of course, could provide six of Germany’s line-up.

Rizzoli boasts a CV to compare with those of Webb and Pierluigi Collina, the 2002 final referee.

I just hope Rizzoli’s final is as easy to handle as his fellow Italian’s and nothing like the brutal game Webb got four years ago.

Discipline: English referee Howard Webb (right) refereed the brutal World Cup final in 2010

Prediction: Webb says even the most experienced of referees 'can do something crazy' in a final

Top class: Rizzoli has a CV comparable with Webb and former Italian referee Pierluigi Collina
