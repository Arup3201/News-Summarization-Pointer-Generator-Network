Flop striker cost Sunderland £3.2million last January

29-year-old played just eight games for Black Cats

Scocco failed to score for Sunderland and re-joins Newell's Old Boys

Newell's Old Boys have confirmed the signing of Sunderland striker Ignacio Scocco.

The 29-year-old, known as 'Nacho', arrived on Wearside in January as Poyet invested £3.2million in his services in the search for goals to keep the Black Cats in the Barclays Premier League.

Ultimately, it was a gamble which did not pay off as Scocco made only eight appearances and failed to find the back of the net.

Flop:  Ignacio Scocco has left Sunderland to join former club Newell's Old Boys

Former club Newell's Old Boys have been on his trail for several weeks and on Wednesday night got their man, with a tweet welcoming the Argentinian back to a club he has had two previous spells at.

A tweet from the Argentinian club read: 'First of all, a fan of Newell's...welcome @nachoscocco32!'
