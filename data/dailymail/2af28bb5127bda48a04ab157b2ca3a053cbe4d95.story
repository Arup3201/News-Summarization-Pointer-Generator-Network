Three people have now died in a powerful storm which is sweeping through Japan, forcing rivers to burst their banks and triggering a landslide which killed a 12-year-old boy.

Half a million people were told to evacuate on Monday under the threat of Typhoon Neoguri, which had winds of up to 155mph and waves almost 50ft high.

First feared to be a 'super typhoon', Neoguri was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it made landfall but has left a trail of devastation in its wake.

Horror: The storm has now killed three people, including a pensioner who fell into a swollen river

In Nagiso, central Japan, a landslide sent mud and rock tumbling
 down a mountainside last night, killing a 12-year-old boy - the third victim of the storm.

The torrent of rock destroyed bridges, railway lines and cars and left water pouring freely down the mountainside.

One victim of the landslide said: 'At 
first I thought it was an earthquake, then the house started filling 
with mud.

'I clung to
 a pillar with all my strength.'

Another of the three people killed was an 83-year-old man who fell into a swollen river and died.

At least another 50 people have been injured, many of them from falls.

Heavy rains and gusts inland of 78mph yesterday prompted hundreds more flights and trains to be cancelled and left schools closed.

The storm - whose name means 'raccoon dog' in Korean - also threatened flooding in remote regions of Japan which has halted its heavy industries.

Operations were suspended at the Nishihara oil refinery on the island of Okinawa, which normally produces 100,000 
barrels a day, on Monday night and had still not resumed today.

All of Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are
 shut down during the storm, which comes three years after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi 
nuclear plant.

The facility was wrecked by an earthquake and tsunami in March 
2011 and still leaks dangerous radiation.

The storm is due to sweep north east up Japan's eastern coast today, battering Tokyo and Osaka and touching on the Fukushima region.

Torrential rainfall could trigger
 more high tides, landslides and floods, and much of eastern Japan was at risk of 
lightning and tornadoes.

On
 the island of Okinawa, more than 105,000 homes lost power at the storm's peak and 32 people were injured, two of them seriously.

A spokesman for the island's government said it had experienced its heaviest rainfall in half a century.

The Japan Meteorological Agency said 'violent winds' had dissipated but 'rain is still a concern in many places'.

The official said: 'There are some places that may get as much as a month's worth of rain over the next 24 hours.'

Two to four typhoons make landfall in Japan each year, but this storm is one of the largest ever to hit Japan during the summer, when they are extremely rare.
