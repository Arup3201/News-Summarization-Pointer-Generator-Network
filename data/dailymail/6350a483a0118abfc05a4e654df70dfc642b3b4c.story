Prince William envies his younger brother flying helicopters on the frontline while Prince Harry envies William his satisfying job and cosy family set-up, the younger Prince revealed today.

In an honest interview conducted before the 28-year-old Prince Harry flew back to Britain after a 20-week tour of Afghanistan, he shed light on his relationship with his brother.

And he revealed that Prince William is privately frustrated at not being able to serve on the frontline because of his future role.

Prince Harry, who has just finished his second deployment in Afghanistan, where he was a co-pilot gunner in Apache helicopters, said: 'I think there is a bit of jealousy, not just the fact that I get to fly this, but obviously he'd love to be out here.

'And to be honest with you, I don't see why he couldn't.

'His job out here would be flying the IRT [Immediate Response Team], or whatever, doing Chinook missions.  Just the same as us - no-one knows who's in the cockpit.

'Yes you get shot at, but if the guys who are doing the same job as us are being shot at on the ground, I don't think there's anything wrong with us being shot at as well.

'People back home will have issues with that, but we're not special. The guys out there are, simple as that.'

William, 30, the future Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, is an RAF Flight Lieutenant and works as a Search and Rescue Force pilot on Sea King helicopters.

Based at RAF Valley on Anglesey in North Wales, he commands missions to help stranded climbers and stricken vessels in the area.

Prince Harry revealed there is envy on both sides.

'Before coming out here I was very jealous of my brother,' he said.

'It's operational flying back home. You get all the luxuries of operational flying - the pride, as you call it - and the reward of basically saving people's lives, which is exactly what we try and do as well.

'And back home he gets to go home to his wife and dog, whereas out here we don't. We're stuck playing PlayStation in a tent full of men.'

While Harry flies an Apache helicopter, his older brother flies a completely different Sea King helicopter.

'He could fly this. I'd like to think I could fly his,' he said.

Captain Wales, as Harry is known in the army, added with a brotherly dig: ‘His job's very cool, and I think he's doing a wonderful job. Even though he's in the RAF.’

Harry is the latest in a long line of royals who have served in the Armed Forces, particularly flying helicopters.

The Prince of Wales and Duke of York both trained as helicopter pilots, with Andrew taking part in missions in the Falklands War.

But Harry revealed it is not just the family association with rotary aircraft that intrigued him and his brother.

‘Probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us - like you guys,’ he joked with the press.

‘Our father flew, our uncle's flown, all sorts of people have flown in my family.

‘And I wouldn't suggest that's where it's come from, but it is great fun, and I was given the opportunity in the end, and I couldn't say no to it.’

In the interview Prince Harry, who is '100 per cent single', also spoke of his happiness about becoming an uncle this summer.

'Obviously I'm thrilled for both of them,' he said in Helmand shortly after news of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy came out.

'It's about time,' he joked.  'I can't wait to be an uncle.'

He said he had telephoned the future parents to congratulate them, adding: 'Of course I have - I had a chat to them.'

Asked if there was pressure on him to settle down, he said: 'I don't think you can ever be urged to settle down.

'If you find the right person and everything feels right, then it takes time, especially for myself and my brother.

'You ain't ever going to find someone who's going to jump into the position that it would hold, simple as that.'
