Wales manager Chris Coleman has admitted that he will talk to Ched Evans before deciding whether to pick him for Wales again.

Evans has been in prison since his conviction for rape in April 2012, but hopes to return to professional football on his release. 

A petition asking his club Sheffield United not to allow him back in their squad has been signed by more than 65,000 people, but Coleman says that, if the Football Association of Wales allow it, he would talk to the player about a return. 

Ched Evans has won 13 caps for Wales but has not played professionally since his conviction

Chris Coleman is keeping his options open and says he will talk to the FAW before meeting the player

'He was found guilty of a horrible crime and it has put me in a horrible position, too,' Coleman told the Daily Star Sunday. 'I am aware of this online petition against him returning to football.

'But I am also aware that if he were say a plumber, or a carpenter, and you come out of jail, you are permitted to get back to your career. Because of the high profile nature of the sport, football is so different.

'That is why I will need to sit down and talk with the Football Association of Wales first before this could happen. Then I would also need to sit down and talk with Ched.' 

Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence 

Former Wales manager Terry Yorath also said that he would pick the striker once he is released from prison if the FAW allowed it.

'Probably at the back of my mind I would be thinking we need a Ched Evans in the side so I’m going to go in that committee and say "Listen we could do with him in the squad."' Yorath told Wales on Sunday.
