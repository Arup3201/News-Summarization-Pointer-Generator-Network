Pope Francis has had lunch with at least 10 gay, transgender and HIV-suffering inmates at a prison in Naples today, it has been reported.

They were among 90 prisoners invited to dine with the pontiff on his day-long trip to southern-Italy.

The stop-off at the Giuseppe Salvia Detention Centre in Poggioreale was not originally on his schedule, according to Italian TV station TV 2000.

But the Pope reportedly insisted on the meal which was prepared by the prisoners themselves.

Adoration: Thousands of people turned out to cheer the Pope on his day-long visit to Naples where he will hold a number of events before returning to the Vatican tonight

The inmates who dined with the pope were chosen by lottery from around 1,900, the Vatican Insider website has reported. 

And it was a very simple and 'frugal' because the Pope wants to take the time to get to know every prisoner personally, the head of a prison ministry told Vatican Radio.

The prison visit formed part of a very busy day for Pope Francis in the Italian city that lies 150 miles south of Rome.

Francis began praying at a sanctuary in Pompeii, before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the Vatican this evening.

Since his election two years ago, the Argentine pontiff has led a new and welcoming approach to gay and transgender people.

When asked whether a gay man could be a priest, he reportedly replied: 'Who am I to judge?'

And in late January, he had a private meeting in the Vatican with a Spanish transgender man who wrote to Francs about the rejection he was facing at his home parish.

On Holy Thursday next month, he will wash the feet of male and female inmates at a prison near Rome as part of his continued public outreach to detainees.

Before the lunch, Pope Francis called on members of organised crime to turn away from the violence to 'stop the tears of the mothers of Naples' in one of the city's most violent areas.

He was speaking in the shadow of a housing project known as Le Vele which is considered so dangerous that even the police are sometimes afraid to enter.

The blighted area has been a battleground for 'Camorra' clans fighting each other for control of drug trafficking and extortion rackets.

He urged the locals not to let criminals rob them of their hope and also said members of organised crime excommunicate themselves from the Church - but it would welcome them back if they repent.
