Former Major League Baseball player Chad Curtis was today sentenced to seven-to-15 years in prison for sexually assaulting three young girls after a judge told him: 'You are a threat to any community you get into'.

Curtis, 44, was convicted last Friday in a Michigan court room after a week-long trial, during which all three of the girls - two of whom were only 15 at the time of the assault - took the stand and testified about what happened in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach.

Before the judge handed down his sentence today, Curtis gave a long and rambling statement - which lasted more than an hour - in which he denied the assaults, accused the girls of propositioning him and said he led prison inmates at Barry County Jail to Christ.

As he told the judge he was the one who 
told the girls he would not engage in a romantic relationship with them,
his victims stormed out of the courtroom.

His 16-year-old victim who testified that he touched her private areas and fondled and kissed her breasts, made a statement prior to sentencing before a packed courtroom that included Curtis’ wife, MLive reports.

'I, myself, kept giving you a chance to walk away from the monster you'd become. As a Christian, I don’t hope for any bad things to happen to you,' she said. 'I hope for good things. I hope you admit what you’ve done to God and yourself.'

He hugged his wife and children after the verdict was read.

The two-time World Series champion was 
set to become the school’s head football coach last fall, but resigned 
when the allegations were made public.

Despite being described by defense witnesses as a man of ‘high moral character', the Grand Rapids Press reported, the girls’ detailed accounts and no-nonsense testimony did the former Yankees outfielder in.

In court today however, the prosecution said: 'He's not a trainer, he's a sexual predator'.

During his statement he accused all of his victims of lying and said that one day he would write a book with one of the girls that 'would benefit millions of people', adding, 'the truth will set her free'.

Curtis was first accused of inappropriately touching the buttocks of two female students, both 15 at the time of the incidents as recent as April 2012, while he was the volunteer strength and conditioning coach at Lakewood High School.

A third student, 16, then came forward and said Curtis touched her private areas and kissed her breasts the previous summer.

‘It appears as if [the victims] left 
quite a strong impression with the jury,’ the prosecutor told the Grand 
Rapids Press after his conviction last week. ‘They were unequivocal 
about what happened to them.’

‘This
has been such a long road for them,’ Nakfoor-Pratt told the paper, 
adding that ‘this is a step in the healing process for them'.

The conviction came despite a female massage therapist testifying on the defense’s behalf that she didn’t think it was ‘unusual to massage the area around someone's butt in a full-body massage'.

While that may have explained two of the occurrences, the massage therapist didn’t address the third girl’s accusations.

‘It definitely was not therapeutic touching,’ said the prosecutor.

Curtis played 10 seasons during his big league career. First coming up with the then-California Angels in 1992. The outfielder then moved on to the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers.

He won two World Series rings with the Yankees in 1999 in 2000 – famously hitting a game winning walk-off home run in the 10th inning of game three of the 1999 World Series, his second of the game.

Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32.

The soon-to-be convict was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration.

When the allegations were first made public, the devout Christian asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring God'.
