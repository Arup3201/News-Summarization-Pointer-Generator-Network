A former Royal Marine and 'loving dad' has been battered to death in the street as he left a rugby game in South Africa.

Horrified witnesses said 'placid' Brett Williams, 29 - a South African-born British citizen - was severely beaten and kicked by a group of fans after accidentally bumping into a man after the match.

The murder followed a game between Durban Sharks and Melbourne Rebels on Saturday, and happened outside the home side's supporters' club.

'Top quality family man': Witnesses said former Royal Marine Brett Williams, 29, was severely beaten and kicked by a group of fans after accidentally bumping into a man after a rugby game in South Africa

Mr Williams had been a Royal Marine until March last year and served in Afghanistan with Somerset-based 40 Commando.

He had a daughter, Lailah, with his partner Louise Scott, who will turn four next week.

The
former Marine was born in South Africa but had become a British citizen
and previously lived in the village of Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, near 
40 Commando's HQ.

After
leaving the Marines he returned to South Africa where he had been 
working as a security guard protecting ships from pirates.

He
was taking a short break after his ship docked in Durban and was due to
travel to Johannesburg the day after his death to visit relatives.

His devastated cousin Tarryn Williams said Mr Williams had attended the rugby game with crewmates.

She said: 'He was not a trouble-starter. He was the most placid guy.'

Josh
Mills, a friend and former colleague in the Royal Marines, said: 'He 
was an absolutely fantastic guy and will be sorely missed by everyone.

'He was a loving dad who thought the world of Louise and Lailah. He was a top quality family man.'

Stadium: Mr Williams had been to watch a rugby match at Durban's Kings Park stadium on Saturday

He said Mr William's family had been told an arrest has been made in connection with the attack.

The
Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national on
March 24 in Durban. We stand ready to provide consular assistance at 
this difficult time.'
