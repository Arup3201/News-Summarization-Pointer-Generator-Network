An influential Iran parliamentarian has claimed that the country has arrested 12 CIA agents.

Parviz Sorouri, who sits on the powerful committee of foreign policy and national security, said agents had been operating with Israel's Mossad as well as other regional agencies, and targeted the country's military and its nuclear programme.

‘The U.S. and Zionist regime's espionage apparatuses were trying to damage Iran both from inside and outside with a heavy blow, using regional intelligence services,’ he was quoted as having said yesterday.

‘Fortunately, with swift reaction by the Iranian intelligence department, the actions failed to bear fruit.' He did not specify the nationality of the alleged agents, nor when or where they had been arrested.

Concern has been growing in both Israel 
and the U.S. at the prospect of a nuclear Iran and Tel Aviv has long 
warned it might carry out a military strike on Iran's nuclear programme.

Spying: The discovery damages U.S. attempts to track the activities of 
Iran and its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, and Hezbollah's Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah

A UN report earlier this month claimed 
the country was on the verge of building an atomic which prompted a 
strident response from Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the country would not 
retreat 'one iota' from its nuclear programme.

Hezbollah and Iran are among the CIA's toughest adversaries and have been improving their ability to hunt spies by relying on patience and guile to exploit holes.

The number of CIA agents in Iran and Lebanon countries is classified - but Iran claimed in May it arrested at least 30 people allegedly linked to a CIA-run spy network.

Hezbollah - backed by Iran - has built a professional counter-intelligence operation they proudly describe as the 'spy combat unit'.

But the U.S. has had no diplomatic presence in Iran for 30 years and this makes the CIA's job of finding out what is happening on the ground all the more important.

The report said Iran 
could start building a nuclear bomb in a matter of months.

The issue of what to do about Iran 
has came to the fore in the U.S. political scene yesterday after Newt 
Gingrich, frontrunner in the Republican presidential race, called for 
regime change in the country.

He said the U.S. and its allies could
‘break’ the country within a year by cutting off the country’s fuel 
supplies and sabotaging its sole oil refinery.

He added that the U.S. should bomb Iran’s facilities to prevent it becoming a nuclear power, but only as a ‘last recourse’.

His hawkish comments will alarm experts who have warned of catastrophic consequences if military action is taken against Iran.

Iran periodically announces the capture 
or execution of alleged U.S. or Israeli spies, and often no further 
information is released.

The announcement follows the unravelling by Lebanon's Hezbollah - an extremist Shiite Muslim group with close links to Iran - of a CIA spy ring in that country.

Hezbollah's long-time leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, boasted in June on television he had unmasked at least two CIA spies who had infiltrated the ranks of the organisation.

Though the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon officially denied the accusation, American officials conceded that Nasrallah wasn't lying and that Hezbollah had subsequently methodically picked off CIA informants.

Earlier this week it was reported that more than a dozen CIA spies had been caught in Iran and Lebanon. The U.S. government now 
fears they have been executed.

Past explosions: In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut

The
spies were said to be paid informants who were targeting Iran and Hezbollah group in Beirut.

Their
discovery is a big hindrance to U.S. attempts to track Iran’s nuclear 
activities and discover if Hezbollah is plotting any attacks against 
Israel.

Former
senior CIA officer Robert Baer worked against Hezbollah in the 1980s 
and told ABC news that the group will often execute those it believes to be spies.

Other officials pointed out Hezbollah killed more Americans than any other terrorist organisation before the 9/11 attacks.

In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut.

Bob Baer said U.S. spies no longer know the trade well enough

A former senior CIA officer has admitted that the loss of agents is a major setback – and not an isolated incident.

‘When you lose your entire station, either in Tehran or Beirut, that's a catastrophe,’ Bob Baer (pictured right) told ABC News.

He said it was due in part to a new generation of agents not using traditional methods of intelligence gathering.

‘They don't understand tradecraft,’ said Baer, who thinks the CIA has taken on military habits. ‘And we have lost our touch in espionage.’

Baer said that simply serving in war zones means many agents are unprepared for other demands. Other CIA officers agree with this.

‘There is an entire generation of case officers who have only met with assets on a base, surrounded by security,’ said one retired officer.

‘It's not the same as meeting assets on a street, where you are responsible for your own security and surveillance.’
