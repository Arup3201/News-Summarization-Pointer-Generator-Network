A new range of extreme wheelchairs are on track to banish old-fashioned designs by combining them with tank treads

Looking rather like something out of a science fiction film, The ‘Ziesel’ can tackle perilous terrains that normally would be totally inaccessible to normal wheelchairs.

The Austrian engineers behind the new 
design have replaced the traditional rubber tyres with tracks, 
inspired by army tanks, in a bid to create the ultimate thrill-seekers 
gadget.

Reaching speeds of up to 35km/h, the £19,000 Ziesel chairs have become increasingly common across European ski slopes

Using high performance motors powered by lithium-ion batteries, the all-weather rubber tracks allow the 210kg chair to glide over land

A body-moulded seat is set within a Tubular steel frame which provides rollover protection and the driver is strapped in with 4-point safety seat belt.

The chair even features a autonomic heating system for use in low temperatures.

Surprisingly, given the speed of the Ziesel, there are no roaring engines and no exhaust fumes, as the mobility scooters are powered totally by electricity.

Reaching speeds of up to 35km per hour, the £19,000 chairs have become increasingly common across European ski slopes, toboggan runs, cross-country skiing tracks and hiking trails.

Specialists at design company Mattro said: ‘The Ziesel, with its silent and ecological electric motors, was designed to be a loyal companion that lets you enjoy nature to the fullest.

'It grants people hours of driving pleasure, giving them access to places they could never go before.

'The Ziesel is a pioneer for mobility and combines sustainable and environment-friendly technologies with pure outdoor fun.

'It is the only sport-vehicle with electrical high-performance power for fun and freedom in nature.'

The Ziesel was developed for outdoor action and can be used all year round on almost all surfaces - conquering snow, sand, stone, mud, grass and more.

Using high performance motors powered by lithium-ion batteries, the all-weather tracks allow the 210kg chair to glide over land.

Owners will be able to buy additional features, including towbar for snowmobiles, extra chargers and even have a bespoke paint job on their chair
