Classmates of Jaylen Fryberg have said the popular schoolboy and recently crowned homecoming prince seemed fine in the days and hours leading up to cafeteria shooting. 

One friend even described how he had a conversation with the shooter on the morning of the attack where he acted normally. 

Junior Nathan Heckendorf told CNN that Fryberg had just returned to school after being suspended following a fight during football practice.

Acted normally beforehand: Classmates of Jaylen Fryberg have said the  recently crowned homecoming prince seemed fine in the days and hours leading up to cafeteria shooting

In an interview with the station, he said: 'His final words that he said to me were about the fight. He said "It was an act of anger, and an act of aggression and I should have used words".' 

Students who knew Fryberg described him as outgoing and unlike the loner personality that is often associated with school shootings.

'He seemed totally normal,' said Gladis Jimenez, 15. 'Yes, he had a lot of friends.'

Another student told CNN: 'He seemed like the perfectly normal kid we all knew, everyone knew him. He was always a very nice kid.'

At The Grove Church in Marysville, hundreds of parents, students and community members overflowed aisles during a vigil on Friday evening, holding flowers and crying audibly throughout a prayer service.

Outside, 9th grader Bella Panjeli said she attended a different school but was friends with one of the female victims, calling her 'a beautiful girl and so, so sweet.'

She also said Fryberg was in an ongoing dispute with his cousin over the victim's affections.

'I heard he asked her out and she rebuffed him and was with his cousin,' Panjeli said, adding that she learned of the connection after talking to the victim's family and friends. It was a fight over a girl.' 

Reputation: A witness to the shooting said Fryberg - who was a member of the school football and wrestling team - was popular and 'always a nice guy' 

There were no indications on Fryberg's social media accounts that he had been planning such a rampage, and was even seen smiling while posing for a photo after his homecoming dane.

But on Tuesday he posted his feelings of despondency, apparently over a romantic split, on Twitter.

'It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I'm sweating it off... But I'm not.. And I never will be able to,' he wrote.

Photos uploaded to his Facebook profile also showed that he was a gun enthusiast and keen hunter.

One of his posts on Instagram show him holding a 17HMR that he was given for his birthday.

All of the victims of the shooting were under 18, and three of the wounded were in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the head, said Joanne Roberts, chief of medicine at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The fourth wounded victim suffered less serious injuries.

Describing the deadly attack, Jordan Luton told CNN: 'He came up from behind and had a gun in his hand and he fired about eight bullets ... They were his friends so it wasn't just random.

'Then he turned and looked at me and my girlfriend ... and kind of gave us a smirk and turned around and then shot more bullets outside.' 

Other witnesses said he had a blank face when he walked into the room full of hundreds of students.  

Hobbies: Recent photos downloaded onto his Facebook page suggested he enjoyed hunting and was a gun enthusiast. He took a photo posing with a rifle he was given for his birthday
