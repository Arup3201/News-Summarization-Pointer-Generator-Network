As if losing 2-1 at home to Swansea City on the opening afternoon of the Barclays Premier League season wasn't bad enough, Ashley Young's efforts to rally Manchester United's lacklustre troops resulted in an unexpected delivery from above.

In images captured by BT Sport and quickly spread on Twitter, the midfielder was ranting and raving at the defence when a dollop of bird excrement appeared to land in his mouth.

The bird must have laser-guided aim, as its 'delivery' landed right on the inside of the England international's lower lip from quite some distance away.

Frustration: Young cut an annoyed figure as lacklustre United slipped to defeat in Van Gaal's first game

It was not quite the Premier League debut Louis Van Gaal imagined as a sluggish United performance at Old Trafford saw them succumb to defeat.

The Dutchman has restored optimism to Old Trafford following the dark days of the David Moyes era last season and he was given a rapturous welcome as he walked out before kick-off.

VIDEO Manchester United post-match reaction 

Bad start: The loss to Swansea was not the result Louis Van Gaal envisaged in his first match in charge

Winner: Gylfi Sigurdsson settled the game in Swansea's favour as United's defence crumbled

But the mood fell flat when Swansea's Ki Sung-Yeung curled home from the edge of the box after 28 minutes.

Wayne Rooney hooked home an equaliser for United shortly after half-time but, in an echo of last season, United's defence fell apart to allow Gylfi Sigurdsson to score the winner.

Let's home Young washed his mouth out afterwards.
