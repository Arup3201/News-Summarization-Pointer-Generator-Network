A 26-year-old woman was today arrested on suspicion of neglect following the death of a five-month-old baby girl.

Emergency services were called to reports of an unresponsive infant at a house in Glastonbury Road, Sutton, at around 7.15am.

The baby was taken to St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, where she later died.

The woman, who has not yet been identified, is being held in custody at a south London police station, where the child's death is being treated as 'suspicious'.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, said the girl's next of kin have been informed.

'The postmortem will be held in due course. We won’t be naming the baby,' she said. 'The incident is being treated as suspicious at this stage.'

She added that officers from the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command are investigating.

It is thought that emergency crews left the scene at around 10.30am, but two officers remained stationed outside the property this afternoon.

The house was occupied by a young mother with three children, the Sutton Guardian understands. 

One witness, who asked not to be named, said she saw ‘a lot of neighbours outside the address talking’ this morning, while another said that officers had been ‘outside ever since’ the incident broke.
