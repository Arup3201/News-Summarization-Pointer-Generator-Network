Popping the question while dressed as anime character Dr Franken Stein and in front of hundreds of people might not sound like the ideal proposal but for Matt Dunn, 23, from Guisburgh in Yorkshire, that's exactly what it was.

Girlfriend Molly Turner, who was dressed up as 'saucy' fantasy character Ikaros, got the surprise of her life when Mr Dunn grabbed the microphone during an appearance on stage.

Luckily, the 22-year-old cosplay fan was thrilled with the very public proposal and said yes straightaway.

'She said "yes" and the whole room cheered for us,' said Mr Dunn, a graduate in computer games studies.

'Beforehand my heart was beating so loudly I couldn't really hear anything else. There were rivers of tears afterwards!'

The couple, who have been together for two years, first met at another cosplay convention called NemaCon at Middlesborough Town Hall.

According to a smitten Mr Dunn, his bride-to-be, who was dressed as Japanese character Nema-Chan, stood out in her bright pink wig and homemade green dress.

'Molly has 
an obsession with wigs and she looked brilliant,' he said. 'We met 
during a challenge on computer game Soulcalibur IV.

'I was dressed as Dr. Franken Stein from the anime Soul Eater in white lab coat with a bolt through my head.'

The couple now regularly attend Cosplay events across the north of England and still enjoy dressing up as their favourite cartoon, anime and gaming characters.

At the Sunderland convention where Mr Dunn took to the stage to pop the question, Miss Turner was wearing a favourite ensemble, while her new fiance chose to dress as Summoner from The League of Legends computer game.

'When she was Ikaros from the anime Heaven's Lost Property she looked really beautiful. She made these incredible wings,' said Mr Dunn.

'Cosplay is all about going to a place with like minded people,' added the lovelorn gaming fan, who will move into a new home with his fiancee in the coming months. 'It's just a lot of fun.'

However despite their love of Japanese cartoons and computer games the wedding will be traditionally Gothic - an idea of Miss Turner's.
