After taking tree bark for a decade, 72-year-old Marlene Barnes has no active trace of Crohn's disease in her system

A grandmother claims to have healed herself of a painful bowel condition by eating tree bark. 

Marlene Barnes, 72, started chewing chippings after 48 years with the bowel condition Crohn’s disease.

The inflammatory bowel condition, which affects 60,000 Britons, causes symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue.

Now, a decade on, her doctor has confirmed she no longer has an active trace of the illness in her system. 

Ms Barnes was diagnosed with Crohn’s when she was just 14. 'I’d tried everything to stop it but nothing worked,' said the mother-of-two who had part of her colon removed when she was younger.

The inflammation caused by Chron's destroys the tissue of the bowel so badly that surgeons must cut out sections of the intestine.

She told The Sun: 'Then I read of bark’s medicinal properties and felt it was worth a go.'

She began cutting bark off trees in a park, then dried and ground it up at home. 

She said: 'I ate hazel bark first and it felt like a dozen ferrets fighting in my stomach. I thought I’d die, but I began to feel better than I’d done in ages.

'I then tried lots of trees to work out which were the real miracle cures.

'It was just trial and error. I nearly poisoned myself so many times but now I feel wonderful.'

Ms Barnes, who lives in Cardiff, apparently spends almost £1,000 a year on specialist barks from alternative medicine websites. She takes a dose of 120ml a day.

Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel condition which affects 60,000 Britons, causes symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue

A letter from her consultant gastroenterologist in August said: 'Recent investigations have shown no evidence of active disease.' 

She now apparently plans to sell her secret bark recipe to a pharmaceutical giant. 

Extracts of the slippery elm tree are sometimes suggested for digsetive conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but there are many questions over the safety and effectiveness of many herbal medicines.
