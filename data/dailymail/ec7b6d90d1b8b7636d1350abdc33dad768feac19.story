Victim: Judith Richardson's body was found in her hallway last Friday. She had reportedly been attacked with a hammer

A 78-year-old woman and an 84-year-old man have been arrested in connection with the hammer killing of a pensioner.

Judith Richardson, of Hexham, died from head injuries following what police said was 'a brutal attack on an innocent elderly lady'.

Police found Miss Richardson's body in the hallway of her stone-built terraced home in St Wilfrid's Road after her stolen handbag and some contents were found in a litter bin in Newcastle city centre, 25 miles away.

The pair were arrested  in connection with the murder and released on police bail pending further inquiries.

Police appealed for witnesses and have begun a poster campaign to urge people to come forward.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Young, leading the investigation, said a hammer was found during searches of the murder scene.

The lightweight joiner's hammer, found in an Aldi carrier bag and believed to have been the murder weapon, was sent for forensic testing.

DCI Young said: 'It was discovered in an Aldi carrier bag on Saint Wilfrid's Road and we are keen to establish how it got there.'

Miss Richardson's last known movements were to go shopping in the Tesco and Aldi stores in Hexham, before driving home.

Her stolen handbag was found in a litter bin outside the Mind charity shop on Clayton Street, Newcastle, by a passer-by.

A poster campaign has also been launched in an attempt to piece together what happened to Miss Richardson who lived alone with her West Highland terrier, Hamish.

Miss Richardson was described as ‘a wonderful woman from a very small family, who are devastated by her loss’.

She had never married and had no children.
