The lack of stigma attached to divorce and the financial independence of women has fuelled a rise in separations among the over-60s.

The growing number of ‘silver separators’ is in stark contrast to the falling divorce rates among younger couples.

Official figures show there were 9,439 divorces where the husband was over 60 in 2011, up 73 per cent in two decades.

Among women over 60, the increase was 81 per cent.

Silver splitters: New figures show how the number of divorces involving men aged over-60 has soared, while the overall number of divorces has fallen

Trend: Despite Britain's rising population, the overall divorce rate has fallen but is on the up among over-60s

The Office for National Statistics, which compiled the report, said older couples no longer feel the pressure from friends and family to stay together. It added: ‘As it becomes more common to be divorced, there are fewer stigmas attached.’

Although the figures are largely driven by men divorcing their wives, the report says the financial security of working women has added to the increase.

‘Women have become more financially independent and are more likely to have built up their own pensions,’ it said. ‘Therefore in general women are now more able to support themselves outside of marriage than in the past.’

Nevertheless, the report said, women tend to have lower pensions than men and this may be a reason why wives are less likely to be the marriage partner who files for divorce among couples over 60. However women are more likely to ask for a divorce among younger couples.

Among married men over 60, 2.3 in every 1,000 got divorced in 2011 compared to only 1.6 in every 1,000 in 1991. The rising trend among older people went in the opposite direction to divorce rates for couples of all ages.

Laughing matter: The phenomenon of pensioners splitting up is now so widespread it was the basis of ITV's comedy drama Love and Marriage, starring Alison Steadman

These showed the 13.6 divorces for every 1,000 married men in 1991 dropped to 10.8 for every 1,000 in 2011.

One reason for the increase in the over-60s splitting up is that there are now many more older people than in past decades.

The average time a marriage has lasted when a husband over 60 is divorced is 27.4 years, the ONS said. The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce for couples of all ages is 11.5 years.

Divorce lawyers suggested that older couples from the ‘baby boom’ generation are coming to share the attitudes of a generation among which many  people prefer informal cohabitation to marriage.

Better health is also encouraging older people to behave in the same way as those in their thirties and forties, they added.

Sam Hall of JMW Solicitors said: ‘Retirement can be a real crunch point for couples.

‘One spouse often carries on their life as they have done for many years whilst the other retires, not only professionally but socially as well. It is a realisation that they have different interests.

‘I had one client who basically reached a point where he decided he just couldn’t put up with the marriage any more and wanted to enjoy his old age.

‘He actually commented to me during the divorce proceedings that he “wanted to die in peace”.

‘We have recently had a client in his 80s who left his wife of 60 years for his “fancy woman”, aged 62. He felt life was just too short.’

Andrew Newbury of Pannone Solicitors said: ‘Those currently over the age of 60 are the last generation for whom marriage would have represented the norm.

‘It may come as a surprise to find that older men are responsible for breaking up a marriage.

‘However, while it used to be thought that men would have a limited life expectancy beyond retirement, they now live longer.

‘The combination of a longer life and the means to enjoy it makes the prospect of husbands starting a new life in their later years  more likely.’
