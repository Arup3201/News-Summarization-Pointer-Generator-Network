Ying Tian being sentenced at the Manukau District Court after she was found guilty for driving drunk down the wrong side of motorway in Auckland

A pregnant, wheelchair-bound woman has been jailed in New Zealand after being found guilty of driving drunk and causing a crash that killed a dancer.

Ying Tian, 32, from Clendon Park in Auckland, was jailed for two years and nine months for killing 49-year-old Karen Yong.

Just after midday on May 30, Tian drove for 5km down a motorway in the wrong direction with a blood alcohol reading that was more than double the limit, the New Zealand Herald reported.

She weaved in between oncoming cars, travelling at speeds ranging between 28 km/h and 134 km/h before eventually crashing into Ms Yong's car head on.

Ms Yong, a professional ceroc dancer, suffered critical injuries and her family in Malaysia travelled to New Zealand before making the decision to switch off her life support.

Pregnant Tian appeared in Manukau District Court on Monday in a wheelchair due to leg injuries she suffered in the crash.

Judge Sharon McAuslan told Tian through a Chinese interpreter that she would not be able to serve her time from home, despite the fact that she is pregnant.

Judge McAuslan said her driving was 'totally appalling'.

Ms Yong's mother Marina Lee, who travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland for the sentencing, told the court: 'Nobody can fathom the grief of a mother when her daughter is wrenched away from her.

'This grossly negligent driver needs to be punished, not just for the needless loss of my child, but to caution all other drivers to think through their actions.'

Ms Yong's sister Sharon Yong told the Herald she thought the sentence was too light, adding that an apology letter written to the family by Tian felt insincere.

'It was written as a means of lowering her sentence, that's how it felt to us.'
