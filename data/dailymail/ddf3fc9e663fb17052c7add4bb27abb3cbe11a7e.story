A father was arrested for murder after his seven-year-old son told police he saw him killing a man and then drinking his blood.

The body of Alam Abdul Rehman Khan, 32, a tailor, was found stuffed in a suitcase with his throat slit in Malad, north of Mumbai.

Alam Khan's son told police that he allegedly saw his father and two accomplices kill Mr Khan, a garment worker on October 5.

He said he was outside his house playing with friends in Malwani when he excused himself to drink water and that is when he witnessed his father and two of his friends assault a man.

He claimed that his father's friend smashed the victim's face with a rock, before stabbing the man to death.

'He says he saw his father and two of his friends assault a man. He recounted that his father's friend smashed the victim's face with a huge rock.

'He also saw them stab the victim. He saw the blood splash over his father's face and his father wiping it with his hands,' said an officer, reported the Indian Express.

'He took the names of the two others identified as Sikandar and Sone and known to his father.

'All the three were involved in the gruesome act and the boy narrated each one's actions very vividly,' said the officer.Â 

When police did a reconstruction of the scene they found that the boy may have been mistaken in thinking that he saw his father drinking blood - he could have seen him wipe his face to clean the blood that had splashed from the victim's body.

The victim was allegedly having an affair with a woman identified as Nagma as well as her married daughter, Chandni, reported the International Business Times.

Nagma told the police that her son-in-law had also caught the two together on a few occasions.

Although Khan fled to Kolkota, he was tracked down by police and is now facing murder charges along with the other two men.
