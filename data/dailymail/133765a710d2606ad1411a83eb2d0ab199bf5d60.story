He is known to be somewhat private when it comes to his life as a family man.

But in suing a magazine company for defaming his parenting skills, Tom Cruise has now found intimate details of personal life come to light - including how Scientology played a part in his split from ex-wife Katie Holmes.

Cruise, 51, has filed a $50million lawsuit against Bauer Publishing for their 2012 cover stories of both Life & Style and In Touch that claimed he had 'abandoned' his daughter Suri after divorcing Holmes on 29 June 2012.

Now Radar have obtained a 48-page transcript of a gruelling deposition held in September this year with attorney Elizabeth McNamara, in which Cruise admits he did not see his daughter Suri for 110 days after his divorce.

Radar reports how when asked if his former wife Holmes, 34, had tried to 'protect' Suri from Scientology, Cruise hit back.

'Listen, I find that question offensive,' he is quoted. 'I find it, those statements offensive. Like with any relationship, there are many different levels to it. You know, I, I find it very offensive. There is no need to protect my daughter from my religion.'

Cruise was then asked if Scientology 
was on of the reasons Holmes left him, to which he appeared to admit, 
replying: 'Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes.'

The actor also confirmed that seven-year-old Suri is not longer practising Scientology.

He was then asked if this meant Holmes would be considered a 'Suppressive Person' - a Scientology term used to describe members of the controversial religion who publicly renounce their faith.

'That is a distortion and a simplification of the matter,' he is said to have replied.

'...I don’t want to just give an oversimplification of religious doctrine.'

The site report that an 'angry' Cruise began to explain 'when there is a divorce... things change' at the interrogation held at the LA offices of Cruise's lawyer.

In the document, McNamara probes Tom: 'From June 18 of 2012 until Thanksgiving of 2012, you only say Suri a few times, isn’t that right?,' to which Cruise replies, 'yes'.

McNamara then continues to calculate 
the time that Cruise spent with his daughter Suri following his divorce 
with Holmes, which totalled 10 days.

Cruise then offers that during that time he was able to remain in Suri's life through conversations on the telephone.

'I’ve gotten very good at it. I’ve gotten very good at it. I tell wonderful stories and they like hearing it.'

But McNamara replied, 'It really doesn’t substitute for being able to be there does it?'

'No, it doesn’t,' Cruise replied.

McNamara pushed further when questioning why Cruise was able to attend a Scientology event and return to his filming schedule within 24 hours, but not make a visit to his daughter.

'That’s not true... different situation,' Cruise is quoted as saying.

Defending his parenting skills: Tom Cruise has filed documents stating he has 'in no way cut Suri out' of his life. He is pictured with his youngest daughter in July 2012

The deposition becomes even more 
intense when McNamara compares Cruise's parenting skills to his own 
father Thomas Mapother III, who allegedly left Cruise when he was a 
child.

'The fact that you would suggest that I was being like my father… I find that greatly offensive.'

The case - which is expected to go to trial next year - will see Cruise sue In Touch and Life & Style for libel and defamation.

While the lawsuit drags on, Tom's ex-wife Katie has been seen in South Africa, where she is filming.

Holmes - who recently joined Twitter - posted about the trip, saying: 'So happy to be on twitter!!!!!! Sending first tweets from South Africa!!!!! (sic).'
