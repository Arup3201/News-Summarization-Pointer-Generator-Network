A Qatari man who was declared an 'enemy combatant' by the Bush administration following the September 11, 2001 attacks  has been released from prison and returned home to Qatar. 

Ali al-Marri was arrested in December 2001 while attending graduate school in central Illinois.

He was held without charge for nearly six years in a U.S. Navy brig in South Carolina where lawyers said he endured lengthy interrogations, isolation, and threats to harm his family.

This March 10, 2009, file image of a courtroom drawing from U.S. District Court shows alleged al-Qaeda sleeper agent Ali al-Marri as he made an initial appearance with his attorney Andy Savage in Charleston, S.C.

Al-Marri's nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle returned home and was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries.

Marri, who was in his mid-40s, was detained as a material
witness to the September 11 attacks.

Former President George W. Bush declared him an 'enemy combatant.' 

He entered the United States legally on Sept. 10, 2001 but was suspected of being an al Qaeda agent sent by the militant group to disrupt the U.S. financial system by hacking into bank computers.  

He admitted to training in al-Qaeda camps and staying in al-Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan between 1998 and 2001.

He also admitted to having contact with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, who allegedly helped the hijackers.

At his trial, he expressed sorrow for helping al-Qaeda and said he never intended to hurt anyone. No evidence showed he had a specific mission in the U.S.

But U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm determined that al-Marri's decision not to change course after the 9/11 attacks showed he intended to remain with the terrorist organization.

Al-Marri could have faced up to 15 years in prison. Mihm sentenced him to only eight years and four months behind bars because of what the judge called his 'unacceptable' treatment in the Navy brig.

He was charged with credit card fraud and lying to the FBI and held for 18 months before the U.S. government dropped the charges in 2003.  

The Supreme Court agreed in December 2008 to consider his challenge of his status as an 'enemy combatant' and he was handed over to civilian authorities to stand trial in Illinois. 

In 2009, Al-Marri pleaded guilty to one count of providing
material support and resources to a foreign terrorist
organization.

Despite this, his lawyer, Andy Savage, confirmed that he has now been released from federal prison
in Colorado in the last few days and is at home in Doha, Qatar.

Al-Marri's nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle  was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries.

'He is in high spirits,' Saleh al-Marri said. 

His nephew thanked Qatari officials for their help in getting al-Marri back home, saying they made 'tremendous efforts' to do so.

However, he added that Al-Marri would not be making comments to the media because 'we want to give him an opportunity to reintegrate into society.'    

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons had no immediate comment.

His lawyer said the speed of his client's departure came as a surprise.
