A Hawaii woman whose last name is 36 characters long has finally gotten the whole thing to fit on her driver's license and state identification card.

Janice 'Lokelani' has a surname that consists of 35 letters plus an okina, a mark used in the Hawaiian alphabet. She received her new license and ID after her campaign to get her full name on the cards prompted the state Department of Transportation to change its policy to expand the number of characters that can appear.

Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele, 54, said Monday that she's happy she was able to help fix the problem of identification cards lacking sufficient space for long names.

'Now, in the state of Hawaii, we are no longer second class citizens because of the length of our name,' she said.

Hawaii driver's licenses and ID cards previously had room for names totaling up to 35 characters. The new policy allows 40 characters for last names, 40 for first names and 35 for middle names.

Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele got the name when she married her Hawaiian husband in 1992.

He used only the one name, which his grandfather gave him after it came to him in a dream.

Ms Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele - who got her name after marrying in 1992 - said that her name had many layers of meanings including 'one who would stand up and get people to focus in one direction when there was chaos and confusion, and help them emerge from disorder'.

She said it can also mean 'When 
there is chaos and confusion, you are one that will stand up and get 
people to focus in one direction and come out of the chaos.'

The woman said her husband, who died in 2008, had similar issues with documentation.

She said: 'He always had problems with trying to get people to use his whole name.

'They would chop it up into smaller pieces.'

Under
 the old policy, Hawaii County issued 
Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele her driver's license and state ID 
with the last letter of her name chopped off. And it omitted her first 
name.

She told news media 
about the issue earlier this year after a policeman gave her a hard time
 about her driver's license during a traffic stop.

She told BBC World: 'The policeman looked at my licence and saw I had no first name.

'I told him it is not my fault that my licence and state ID are not correct and I am trying to get it corrected.

'He then told me "Well, you can always change your name back to your maiden name."

'This hurt my heart.'

Ms
 Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele said that the officer's attitude 
upset her because he was being 'disrespectful of the Hawaiian people.'

She
 said: 'Over the last 22 years I have seen... the culture of Hawaii 
being trampled upon and this policeman treated my name as if it was 
mumbo-jumbo.'

Last month, the state Department of Transportation announced it expanded the character limits.

Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele is now hoping to get the Social Security Administration to allow more characters on its identification cards.

The agency's cards have two lines for names. The first line has 26 spaces for first and middle names while the second line has 26 spaces for a last name and suffix.
