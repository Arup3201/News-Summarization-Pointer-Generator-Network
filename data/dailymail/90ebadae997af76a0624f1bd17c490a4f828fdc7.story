Andy Murray has revealed he will leave it until the last minute before deciding whether he will wear a kilt, and go commando, on his wedding day.

Murray got engaged to his long-term partner Kim Sears last year and the couple are set to wed in October.

Murray was quizzed on the subject by on-court interviewer Hamish McLachlan following the Scot's victory over Grigor Dimitrov on Sunday.

Chief among McLachlan's interests was whether Murray would be wearing a suit or a kilt on his wedding day.

Murray, clearly taken a little aback by the question, replied: 'I think... I am going to have both options and see what I feel like in the morning when I wake up.'

Traditionally Scots do not wear any underwear beneath their kilts.

When quizzed on whether he would be wearing a kilt 'properly', Murray replied: 'Yeah, obviously proper kilt, yeah.'

When asked if that meant he would be going 'freeball' - i.e. without any underwear - Murray replied with a smile: 'Exactly.'

Sears, stood up in the stands on Rod Laver Arena, laughed and shook her head as Murray answered the final question.

Murray's mother Judy was also pictured laughing in the crowd during the interview, which soon became a hit on social media.
