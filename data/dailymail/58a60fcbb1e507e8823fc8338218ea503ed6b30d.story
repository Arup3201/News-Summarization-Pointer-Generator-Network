It certainly does not seem like the most comfortable - or sensible place - to take a nap.

But one daredevil decided an iron bridge was the perfect place to catch 40 winks.

The man, known only as Ivan T, had to be rescued by firefighters after he 'fell asleep' on top of the railway bridge in Serbia.

Trams and cars continued to travel over the bridge during the complicated rescue

The 38-year-old was seen lying face down on the iron arch of the Old Railway Bridge about 20ft above the Sava in Belgrade.

Firefighters had to rig up ladders and harnesses to move the man from his precarious sleeping position.

News site B92 said the unusual rescue took place on Sunday.

The man is believed to have been under the influence of alcohol when he climbed the bridge.

No official statement of the incident or whether the man faced any punishment has yet been released.

Nine firefighters were called to the Old Railway Bridge to get the man safely down

Rescuers used a curved ladder to secure him in place before bringing him down with a harness

Video of the rescue shows firefighters securing the sleeping man with an adapted ladder with a curve.

Trams can still be seen crossing the bridge as the rescue unfolds.

Two fire engines were sent to the scene, according to the Belgrade Firefighting-Rescue Unit and nine firefighters were needed to bring him safely down.

The unit told B92 that the man was 'conscious and without injuries' when they eventually took him down.

He was then taken away by police.
