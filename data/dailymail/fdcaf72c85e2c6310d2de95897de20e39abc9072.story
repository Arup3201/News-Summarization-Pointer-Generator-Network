Community anger at shocking footage showing an Australian Federal Police officer pepper spraying a dog and throwing sticks at it during a raid on a home has seen the officer pulled from frontline duty.

Justen Storay, the owner of Laps, a male bull mastiff cross, has filed an official complaint against the Federal Police who conducted the raid on his home in Griffith, a suburb in the Canberra's innner south, in May. Mr Storay was not home at the time of the raid.

An ACT Police spokesperson told the MailOnline in a statement they treat 'allegations such as this seriously' and the matter is currently subject to an 'investigation by AFP Professional Standards.'

The statement said it 'does not condone cruelty to animals in any form. All officers are required to report all use of force actions, and the reported use of oleoresin capsicum spray is part of this requirement.'

According to The Canberra Times, the police officer has been taken out of the field and placed in a different department until the matter is resolved.

Mr Storay's lawyer, Peter Woodhouse, told MailOnline the AFP were 'circling the wagons' and his first contact with AFP Professional Standards unit since they first viewed the footage was on Wednesday - weeks after the footage was released.

'It seems AFP told the RSPCA the capsicum spray didn't hit the dog,' Mr Woodhouse said.

'The only person who would have been able to give that version is the person who did the spraying, and we don't accept what the person is saying.'

Mr Woodhouse also revealed that when police were at his client's house they didn't seize anything.

'They were executing a search warrant in relation to as charge of driving dangerously. I don't know what you could possibly find at someones house to prove that.'

The dog's owner is concerned that the attack may have long-term effects on his family pet, who has been 'standoffish' with a different temperament since the incident, the lawyer said.

The video shows a plain clothes officer in the backyard of a house in Griffith, Canberra standing some distance from the dog.

The officer pretends to bark at the dog, which then appears to bark back at him before running toward the officer, but stops well short of the officer because he in on a chain.

Further along in the footage the officer can be seen heading towards the dog who has run out of the shot after being sprayed

The officer runs backwards before pulling out what has been determined to be his pepper spray. He moves back towards the animal, sprays his can in the dog's direction, who then runs out of view of the camera. Pepper spray is a chemical which causes a deep burning sensation in the eyes.

Minutes later footage shows two more officers can be seen in the yard, one in plain clothes and one in uniform. The officer who sprayed the dog can be seen motioning in its direction off-screen.

Later, he picks up a stick and hurls it what is believed to be in the direction of the animal, which is still not in view of the camera.

The officer is now part of an internal investigation after he was also caught throwing a stick (top left) in the dog's direction

According to dog owner Justen Storay's lawyer Peter Woodhouse, the animal has been behaving differently since the incident
