Russians are being warned of the dangers of the spring thaw after a young university graduate was killed by an icicle that fell 14 storeys onto her head.

Tatyana Igonina, 20, died just a few steps outside the front door to her home after she had left to take her dog for a walk.

Her mother and doctors who had arrived at the scene in Novosibirsk, Siberia, narrowly missed being hit by further blocks of ice as they tended to her body.

The incident is the latest involving falling icicles to take place across Russia as the rising temperatures begin a thaw, according to The Siberian Times.

Public authorities have been tasked with clearing roofs of any overhanging ice, but in some cities they are coming under scrutiny following a spate of injuries and near-misses.

Tributes were paid to Ms Igonina, an only child, on Russian social media sites. She had spent the New Year on a sunshine break to Thailand and was said to be 'very happy' with her life. 

In a post on Vkontakte social media her cousin, Vladimir Makhonin, wrote: 'I will never forget her laughter, her eyes and smile. Farewell beloved sister. I would give everything to hear her voice again.'

According to one of Ms Igonina's friends, investigators refused to approach her body until all remaining icicles were removed from the block of flats

In another tribute, a friend also wrote: 'How to live forever now. Our beauty.'

Ms Igonina had recently graduated from university and was looking for a job.

According to one of her friends investigators refused to approach her body until all remaining icicles were removed from the block of flats.

Following a decree from the mayor of Novosibirsk, public service officials had cleared the roof a week before the tragedy but did not notice blocks office that had formed on a canopy belonging to one of the residents.

It had been assumed the owner would clear the canopy himself, but he did not.

Residents in Russia are used to seeing icicles and snow falling from roofs during winter and particularly in spring when the thaw begins.

Icicles (pictured overhanging a balcony in Siberia) have caused dozens of deaths over the past few years after they thaw and then fall onto people passing below

In 2010, five people died and 150 were injured by icicles in St Petersburg amid the coldest winter for three decades. Nine years earlier 74 people in Moscow were the victims of falling ice, including an 18-year-old killed by a falling shard at his military base.

The last death in Siberia occurred in January 2008 when an 83-year-old was killed, but there have been a number of serious injuries and near misses involving ice this month.

In Novokuznetsk on March 15, a day after Tanya's death, a snow boulder fell on a 17-year-old girl, leaving her with a head wound. The same day, in Ulan-Ude, an icicle hit a 10-year-old boy who was walking with his friend.

A day later, Irkutsk an ice block fell on a 40-year-old woman, as she walked into a shoe shop with her 18-month-old and three-year-old granddaughters. She did not lose consciousness but was taken to hospital with a suspected concussion.

Friends paying tribute to her today said she was 'very happy' with her life and was looking for a job having just graduated from university
