The mother of tortured child Baby P has been receiving taxpayer-funded lessons in how to be a good parent, it was reported today.

Tracey Connelly, 32, is being taught childcare skills along with literacy, numeracy and healthy living skills, it has been claimed.

It comes just two weeks after she was released early from a minimum five-year jail sentence for allowing her son to be tortured to death.

The mother is receiving the lessons at a bail hostel where she is monitored 24 hours a day by CCTV.

The lessons will last for the length of her stay at the hostel, which is expected to be three to seven months, but may be expended due to the high profile nature of her case.

Connelly is reported to be making a new life for herself in the North of England and was seen out laughing and shopping with a friend yesterday in Aldi.

She has ballooned to 22 stone while serving time in Durham jail, and last night her mother spoke of the shock of seeing her daughter's appearance.

Speaking to The Sun Mary O'Connor, 53, said: 'I cried when I saw [her]. She's changed so much - it's the largest I've seen her.

'I guess she's smiling because she's just out of prison. She probably thinks she's safe up there.'

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother's flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 injuries, including a broken back.

The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child's life.

As she was granted parole, Connelly had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused.

These orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger's murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

Instead, Connelly has been given a new name and released in an area far from Haringey, where Peter was killed.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice refused to comment, saying they did not speak about individual cases.
