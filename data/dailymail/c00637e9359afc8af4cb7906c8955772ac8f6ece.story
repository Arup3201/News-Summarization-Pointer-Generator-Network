Unsurprisingly, the Spanish press only has one thing on its mind this Saturday - the highly anticipated 'El Clasico' between Real Madrid and Barcelona.

There are so many questions to be asked ahead of the global showpiece at the Bernabeu. Will Cristiano Ronaldo continue to eclipse Lionel Messi as the world's best player this season? Can Barcelona keep a ninth consecutive clean sheet? And, of course, will Luis Suarez make his debut?

Marca simply lead with the headline 'Colossal' with claims that the ground will shake when these 'two giants of world football head-to-head in the greatest game on the planet'.

Sports daily AS focuses on the players that could see this being the first game featuring teams worth a combined total of £1billion. Their front page predicts the line-ups with pictures of the stars (without the injured Gareth Bale) accompanied by their country's flags with the headline 'World Football Exhibition'.

There is also a quote from Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti saying 'I’m thinking of causing a surprise in the line-up' while his counterpart Luis Enrique warns 'The Clasicos should be heated... and enjoyable'.

El Clasico is expected to attract a global audience of over 400 million fans

Meanwhile, Mundo Deportivo makes no excuses over its allegiance with the headline 'Come On Barca!' and a picture of Messi, Neymar and Suarez - 'the trident that points towards the Bernabeu'.

It has also been calculated that around 400 million people will watch the match from all around the world, with even Enrique's claim that 'We won’t be going there to take risks' failing to dampen expectation.

In Italy, all of the leading sports papers are caught up in the re-opened row between Juventus and Inter Milan. Juve president Andrea Agnelli recently praised former Inter owner Massimo Moratti while simultaneously questioning the value of the Serie A title won by the club in the wake of the 2006 'Calciopoli' match-fixing scandal.

La Gazetta dello Sport offers lines from both sides with Agnelli saying 'I recognise the ex-President’s great love for Inter that took him to accept a Scudetto he did not win’.

Inter's response from new owner Erick Thohir is ‘He is trying to change the course of history and mystify the facts. We won’t allow anyone to change or forget’.

Corriere dello Sport follows suit with 'Agnelli-Thohir, what a clash!' while Tuttosport includes a put down from Thohir: 'In 2006 Juve were relegated into Serie B along with their reputation’.
