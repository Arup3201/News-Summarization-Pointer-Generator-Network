Pensioners who are comfortably off are being urged to donate their winter fuel payment – worth up to £300 – to those at risk of dying from the cold.

All pensioners receive the annual payment from the Government to go towards their heating bills, regardless of their wealth or need.

But the fact it is paid to those who can afford to heat their homes – including millionaires and even those who spend winter abroad – has become increasingly controversial.

Pensioners who are comfortably off are being urged to donate their winter fuel payment - worth up to £300 - to those at risk of dying from the cold

A recent study suggested as many as 2,700 older Britons die each winter because they cannot afford to heat their homes.

Despite sky-high energy prices, the Government has cut winter fuel payments this year from £400 to £300 for the over-80s, and £250 to £200 for all other pensioners.

Now, politicians and public figures have joined Saga to support the Surviving Winter Appeal.

Supporter: Actor Sir David Jason called on wealthy pensioners to forgo their winter fuel payment

Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt called on David Cameron during Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday to support efforts to make it easier for people to donate by including information on the appeal in letters sent out to advise of payments. Mr Cameron agreed to look at the idea, but warned: ‘I would not want to see any pressure put on people to do something that might not be in their best interests.’

Saga, with the Community Foundation Network, wants the appeal to support local charities and community organisations which can reach those most in need of help.

Ros Altmann, Saga’s director general, said: ‘We are particularly concerned about statistics showing that the UK has a higher winter death rate among older people than most other European countries, even those with much colder winters than ours.’

Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe promised to donate her payment. She said: ‘This small gesture is such an easy and obvious way to support local people in real need and I hope others will follow suit.’

Actor Sir David Jason said: ‘It would be great to think that all those people who are in a position to forgo part or all of their own winter fuel payment could join this great scheme and spread a little warmth.’

Other supporters include Sir Terry Wogan, Sir Michael Parkinson, Jonathan Dimbleby, Rosemary Conley and Dame Cleo Laine.
