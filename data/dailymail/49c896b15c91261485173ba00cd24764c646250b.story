A couple have been charged in connection to the savage murder of a Minnesota college student whose body bearing 22 knife wounds was found dumped in a field last fall.

Shavelle Chavez-Nelson, 32, and Ashley Marie Conrade, 24, were both charged Friday with second-degree intentional murder in the slaying of 20-year-old University of Minnesota student Anarae Schnuk.

The victim was reported missing September 23, 2013. A week later, her naked body turned up in a ditch next to a cornfield in Rice County.

Slaughtered: Schnuk, a student at University of Minnesota, was found dead from 22 stab wounds in a ditch September 30, 2013

According to Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom, on the night of her death Schnuk was with Chavez-Nelson, her former boyfriend, and Conrade, his current girlfriend.

Investigators still do not know which of the two suspects stabbed Ms Schnuk, but they say it does not matter because they have enough evidence to prove that both were responsible for causing her death, Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. 

First victim: Nelson allegedly shot and killed Palagor Jobi, 23, the night that Anarae Schunk vanished in Burnsville, Minnesota

Just hours before Schnuk was stabbed to death, the 32-year-old man allegedly shot dead Palagor Jobi at a Burnsville bar.

On Friday, Nelson and Conrade appeared in a Hastings courtroom. The 32-year-old was brought before a judge from prison, where he is serving a nine-year sentence for an unrelated burglary.

A public works crew came upon Anarae Schnuk's body September 30, 2013, while mowing ditches near an 80-acre field in Londsdale.

An autopsy of the woman's body 
revealed that the knife used in the murder severed Schnuk's carotid 
artery and jugular vein, and she likely died within 20 seconds.  

Schnuk also suffered a number of defensive wounds to her hands proving that 'she fought for her life,' said Backstrom.

Officials working on the case said they have found ample DNA evidence on items Nelson had brought to the home of his estranged wife in St Paul after the killing.

The recovered black plastic bags contained Schnuk's white UMN jacket covered in blood and bearing more than 20 holes in it and other items of clothing, which looked as if they had been cut off a body.

Police also recovered Nelson's socks and Conrade's flip flops, a pair of bloodied yellow gloves and gory towels. All the items reeked of bleach.   

The alleged murder weapon, an 8-inch knife, was found on the roof of the building, police said.

Ms Schnuk was last seen outside Nina's Grill with her ex-boyfriend and Conrade, 24, of Rosemount, in the early hours of September 22. Police believe she asked to meet with Nelson to talk about the $5,000 he owed her.

The night took a violent turn when police say Nelson shot dead Jobi, 23, outside the bar. The altercation 
occurred after victim started talking to Nelson's current girlfriend, 
Ashley Conrade.

Conrade would later tell police that she too was jealous and angry that night seeing her boyfriend put his arm around Schnuk in front of her, reported TwinCities.com

After the shooting, Schnuk and the couple returned to Conrade's townhouse in Rosemount, where police believe the 20-year-old was killed sometime between 3.30am and 4.30am. 

When initially questioned by police , Conrade denied killing Schnuk or knowing what happened to her.

Days later, she changed her story, admitting to investigators that she had seen Schnuk's body on her kitchen floor when she came home from work on the night of September 22. 

The 24-year-old woman also revealed that she helped her boyfriend, Nelson, carry a plastic tub containing Schnuk's body to her car, where the trunk had been lined in advance with black plastic bags.

Follow the money: Police say the 20-year-old wanted to meet up with Nelson to discuss the $5,000 he owed her

Nelson
 was eventually cornered by police in a gravel quarry and forced to surrender, reported Shakopee Valley News. According
 to court documents, he was released on bail a week before his September 2013 
arrest for burglary and weapons charges.

Anarae Schnuk, an accomplished chess player, met Nelson at a bus summer in the summer 2012. He lied to the college student that he was a stock broker.

When Schnuk learned the truth about his criminal past, she stuck by him, believing she could help him turn a new leaf. 

She broke up with him a few months later when she discovered that Nelson had been living with a 
woman and the pair had a child together.

'She was a lovely, intelligent and kid-hearted woman,' said the county attorney. 

Not
 long before her murder, the UMN student got in touch with him as her 
owed her $5,000 from when they were dating and she wanted the money 
back.

Ashley Conrade is being held on $2million bail without conditions and $750,000 with conditions. No bail has been set for Nelson since he is already incarcerated. They are due back in court July 11.

Nelson is also facing first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree murder in Jobi’s killing, while Conrade is accused of aiding an offender after the fact in that case.

Speaking of the charges against the couple, Anarae’s brother Owen Schnuk said it was ‘another step forward’ for their family.
