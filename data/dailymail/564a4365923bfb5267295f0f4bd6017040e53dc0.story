Women across the country took off their tops and exercised their right to bare breasts yesterday.

Some two dozen women took to the streets of New York wearing shoes, shorts, and not much more. Elsewhere in the country, scantily-clad participants had posters and pamphlets.

The revealing events were part of what participants called ‘National Go-Topless Day,’ to draw attention to inequality in topless rights between men and women.

Some two dozen topless women protested in a New York City park on a hot, sweaty Sunday as part of National Go Topless Day, a non-profit U.S. organisation founded in 2007.

There were topless men in the park, too, but nobody paid them much attention, a disparity, organizers said, that demonstrated the need for the event.

The topless women drew crowds of onlookers who took pictures and video with their cell phones.

'We say there is nothing wrong with the female nipple,' Karen Heaven, an organizer of the event, told the crowd that quickly formed around her in Manhattan's Bryant Park.

She was wearing white pants and a purse over her shoulder. 'My dog has six, I have two, but I can be put in jail for showing my nipples. It's 2012 – what are we thinking?'

It is legal for women to go topless 
in public in New York City but laws vary widely across the United 
States. Heaven and her colleagues say discrimination is unconstitutional
 and they want full equality.

'I'll
 show these to a few friends and then delete them after a few days,' 
Rudy Sison, a New Yorker who happened to visit the park on Sunday, told 
Reuters as he thumbed through photographs and video he had just taken on
 his phone. 'They're topless.'

Several women waved signs saying: 'Equal Topless Rights For All.' After the speeches, a guitarist led the crowd in a reworking of The Beatles' song 'Let It Be.'

Similar protests were scheduled in about 30 U.S. cities and 10 around the world, organizers said.In Phoenix, another two dozen men and women marched down Central Avenue to promote their rights.

Organiser Jenna Duffy, 27, told The Arizona Republic that the demonstration ‘can bring us closer to gender equality by showing that they are not objects, they are part of us that we are not ashamed of.’

Though dozens more in the Arizona capital looked on, Duffy said that was a large part of the problem, saying: ‘Gawkers…should be walking with us.’

In the march was a self-described ‘stay-at-home grandma’ who said: ‘If there were more opportunities to be naked, I’d be part of it.’

In Asheville, North Carolina, there were hundreds of gawkers, but only a dozen or so participants. The disappointing turn-out could have been in part by a City Council public statement that asked for residents and gawkers alike to avoid the rally.

Police said about 2,000 people turned up to watch or show their solidarity with the cause, according to the Asheville Citizen Times.

The annual Go-Topless Day was established in 2007 by a former sports car journalist called Rael, who founded a religion called the Raelian Movement after he said he was visited by a space alien in a French volcano park who told him life on Earth was created by extra-terrestrial scientists, according to an account on his website.

According to the organisation’s website, it is legal to be topless in cities like Asheville, Austin, Boulder, Colorado, Columbus, Honolulu, Madison, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.

In other states, it is illegal to go topless.
