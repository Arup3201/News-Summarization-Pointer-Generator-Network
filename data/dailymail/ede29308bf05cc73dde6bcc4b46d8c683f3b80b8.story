Amanda Knox’s former boyfriend has been forced to abandon his new life in Switzerland after authorities revoked his residence permit.

Rafaelle Sollecito served four years in prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher, who was found half naked, her throat slit, in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia.

He and Knox were freed on appeal in 2011. But in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally overturned their verdict, ordering the pair to stand retrial.

Immediately afterwards Sollecito left Italy for a new life on the picturesque shores of Lake Lugano, in the Italian-speaking southern Alps.

He said he liked Switzerland because people there are ‘more discreet’.

The student engineer denied that he was fleeing justice and said he would return to face retrial.

He had already been granted residence and registered a not-for-profit company to help victims of miscarriages of justice.

The 29-year-old planned to finish his degree in robotic surgery by correspondence while working on his foundation.

The charity’s purpose was to review cold cases and produce manuscripts and films to tell their stories.

But angry locals, disturbed by the presence of an accused killer in their quiet town, launched a campaign to run him out of town.

Right wing politician Daniele Caverzasio petitioned the council saying: ‘Isn’t being on trial for murder a good enough reason to revoke residency?’

Authorities subsequently found that he hadn’t fully declared his pending legal proceedings on his application form.

Sollecito’s father, Francesco Sollecito, 
condemned the decision, saying it amounted to ‘a moral and social 
lynching of someone who has been found not guilty.’

He said: ‘The town of Lugano has missed a good opportunity to show fairness to someone who has always been innocent and must endure two more trials at least.’

Rafaelle will not appeal the council’s decision, his father said, but will instead return to his home town of Giovinazzo, near Bari in southern Italy, immediately.

He will finish his final exams to graduate from the University of Verona by long distance study, he said.

The retrial is expected to start in the autumn. Knox, who after the appeal verdict in 2011 returned to her hometown of Seattle, is studying for a creative writing degree. She is not expected to attend.
