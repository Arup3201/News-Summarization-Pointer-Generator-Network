UKIP leader Nigel Farage is set to target the Kent seaside seat of South Thanet at the next general election.

Mr Farage will have to depose the incumbent Tory MP, Laura Sandys, who only won the seat in 2010.

The leading Eurosceptic ran in the seat in 2005 but came a distance fourth.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is set to target the Kent seaside seat of South Thanet at the next general election

That was before UKIP’s surge in the polls, when it recently overtook the Liberal Democrats to become the third most popular party.

In the May local elections, UKIP won seven out of eight local seats for the Kent county Council, eliminating all the Tories.

Immigration is a key concern in the area after a rise in Polish migrants in recent years.

South Thanet also has a higher than average number of pensioners, who might find UKIP’s right-of-centre politics appealing.

UKIP hopes to win at least one Westminster seat in 2015 after its candidate came second in the Eastleigh by-election, beating the Tories into third place.

Mr Farage was seriously injured when his light aircraft crashed during an election stunt when trying to unseat Commons speaker John Bercow in 2010

Mr Farage, the South East England MEP, tried to unseat Speaker John Bercow in his Buckinghamshire seat at the last election.

His dare-devil antics nearly cost him his life, however, as on election day a by-plane carrying him and his pilot crashed.

Mr Farage was hospitalised with broken ribs and failed to win the seat.

UKIP expected to do very well at the European elections next spring but observers point out that its backers may not automatically vote UKIP in the general election.

South Thanet has swung between the Conservatives and Labour since the 1980s and is not unused to controversial MPs: Jonathan Aitken was once an MP for the constituency.

Mrs Sandys, the local Tory incumbent told the Financial Times, who revealed Mr Thanet was poised to stand in South Thanet: ‘I am not like Nigel Farage, but I think that will help me. Bring it on.’

A UKIP spokesman said: ‘No decision will be made until after the European Parliament elections in May next year.’
