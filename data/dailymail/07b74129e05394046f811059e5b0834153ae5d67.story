‘After the oldie was refused, he suddenly punched the lad, who fought back by kicking on the oldie. ‘Instantly they twisted together. The oldie was quite strong, and he even bit the lad, who bled profusely.’

Frightened passengers on the moving train called the police, who boarded at the next stop.

Both men were apprehended, but were later released after admitting their ‘wrongdoings’.

The teenager was reported to have refused to have his injuries treated at a hospital.
