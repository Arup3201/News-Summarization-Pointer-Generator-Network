Car insurance fraud is common, but a suspected scammer in South Korea has taken things to a whole new level.

Video has been posted online of a man throwing himself at a moving car and whacking his head against the windscreen - hard enough to shatter the glass - in an apparent bid to claim compensation from the driver.

The video, taken on the 19th of September, begins with footage from a dashboard-mounted camera of a motorist making his way out of a car park, in what appears to be a run-of-the mill day.

But things take a turn for the weird when a pedestrian appears out of the blue, sprinting towards the car to the panic of those inside.

The video shows an apparent run of the mill day as the driver leaves a car park, until a pedestrian appears in the road

A turn for the weird: The footage shows the pedestrian starting to sprint directly toward the car, setting off panic inside the car

When he reaches the car, he leaps onto the hood in a superhero-esque dive and bashes his head into the windscreen.

The glass smashes and the man collapses onto the road.

It appears the opportunist was attempting to get some sort of payout for his efforts, earning him the label of an ‘insurance scammer’ in the video description.

The bizarre act was caught on a video camera mounted on the dashboard of the car.

Insurance fraud is a growing problem in South Korea. According to a recent study from the Insurance Research Centre, an average of 156 people are caught in car insurance fraud schemes in South Korea every day, with the amount of money involved totalling KRW1.18 trillion (AU$1.8 billion) over the last five years.

The use of dash cams is catching on around the world.

Earlier this year, a dash cam captured a cyclist being mowed down on a motorway in Brisbane.

In Russia,  dash cams vastly popular devices, so much so that having one installed directly lowers car insurance costs.

In February, a multitude of dash cam clips of a meteor falling from the sky in Russia went viral, a testament to the popularity of the devices.

The man then tumbles back to the road. According to a recent study from the Insurance Research Centre, an average of 156 people are caught in car insurance fraud schemes in South Korea every day
