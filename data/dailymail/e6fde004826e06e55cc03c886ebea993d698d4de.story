A pair of royal portraits will be reunited for the first time in more than quarter of a century in a new exhibition about the Queen.

The works by Italian portrait painter Pietro Annigoni will go on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London.

It is the first time in 28 years his portrait of the Queen from 1954-5 (below right) has gone on public display.

The painting will be shown on the same wall as Annigoni's second full-length portrait of the Queen which was commissioned by the gallery in 1969.

Other artists whose work will be on show include Lucian Freud, Gilbert and George, Andy Warhol and Lord Snowdon.

Exhibition curator Paul Moorhouse said: 'The Queen is the most represented individual in history - but she remains an enigma. All we really have are images.

'This exhibition explores the creation of the Queen's public persona and the way such images reveals a world of changing ideas and values.'

The Queen: Art and Image exhibition runs at The National Portrait Gallery from tomorrow, 17 May until October.
