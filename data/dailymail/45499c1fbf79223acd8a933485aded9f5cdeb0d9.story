Coffee and red wine are known offenders when it comes to staining teeth.

But did you know there are foods that can actually help whiten them?

Beverly Hills dentist Dr Harold Katz says dark chocolate, green tea and strawberries can all help.

And to get the best results, they should eaten first thing in the morning after plaque has built up on the teeth during the night.

Here, Dr Katz’s shares his top tips for naturally white teeth with MailOnline...

Eating dark chocolate, strawberries and cheese can help whiten the teeth, a leading dentist says

Dark chocolate

This contains theobromine, a bitter powder which helps harden the enamel surface of teeth.

This in turn helps to prevent staining, as a weak outer coating on the teeth makes them more susceptible to discolouration.

Sadly for milk chocolate lovers, the effect does not apply with this type of chocolate.

In fact, Dr Katz says milk chocolate can cause bad breath because it contains sugar and milk.

Green tea

Green tea contains tannins which prevent staining because they stop bacteria sticking to the teeth.

This means it can also prevent bad breath.

The drink also contains chemicals called polyphenols which fight oral acids and bacteria.

Drinking it also boosts fluoride levels in the mouth which may lead to less erosion of the teeth’s enamel.

Dark chocolate contains theobromine which helps harden the enamel surface of teeth. Green tea contains tannins which prevent staining by stopping bacteria sticking to the teeth - it also combats bad breath

Strawberries

These contain malic acid, an enzyme that actually cleans stains off the teeth - and mashed strawberries can be mixed with baking soda to create a natural whitening product.

However, Dr Katz warns that other berries do not have the same effect – in fact, he says some actually stain teeth.

Cheese

A little-known benefit of cheese is that it increases the pH level in the mouth making it less acidic.

This means the chance of discolouration and tooth erosion is reduced.

The calcium in cheese can also contribute to stronger, healthier teeth.

Cheese reduces the pH of the mouth making it less acidic - this means it reduces the risk of tooth erosion

Nuts, seeds, apples and pears

Crunchy and abrasive foods - such as seeds, nuts, apples and pears – help to scrub plaque and stain-causing substances from the teeth.

The crispy texture of apples can also toughen the gums reducing the risk of gum disease and tooth loss.

And, the high water content in apples and pears increases saliva production – saliva is essential for reducing bacteria.

Dr Katz has a new range products that help to whiten and banish bad breath. The Breath Co line will launch in Boots on June 25.
