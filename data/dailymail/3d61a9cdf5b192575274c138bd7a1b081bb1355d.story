The 10 best-paid chief executives in Australia have been revealed and they rake in more than $100 million between them each year.

It comes as the average total pay for CEOs in Australia's top ASX-listed companies hit $4.84 million in 2013, which is 63 times an average worker's earnings.

Bosses from the top 100 companies  received 2.9 percent more in total statutory pay in the last financial year than in the previous 12 months.

Brian McNamee, who was head of pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd, came in on top as Australia's highest paid CEO with a statutory pay of $19.1 million in 2013

Westpac CEO Gail Kelly was the only woman to make the top 10 taking home $9.1 million

Brian McNamee, CSL Ltd: $19.1m

Peter & Steven Lowy, Westfield: $18.3m

Mike Smith, ANZ: $10.1m

Sam Walsh, Rio Tinto: $9.5m

Gail Kelly, Westpac: $9.1m

Dan Dienst, Sims Metal Management: $8.9m

Nicholas Moore, Macquarie Group: $8.82m

David Thodey, Telstra: $8.8m

Richard Goyder, Wesfarmers: $8.5m

Kim McKenszie, Amcor: $8.3m   

But an annual survey of CEO pay from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) released on Thursday found average total pay was at its lowest in a decade when compared to average earnings. 

Termination payments to chief executives of Australia’s largest listed companies have also shrunk by close to 70 per cent in the past five years. 

The numbers were distorted by two bosses who formally resigned at the end of the last financial year, including Brian McNamee from CSL and Dan Dienst of Sims Metal - they were ranked first and sixth respectively in the top 10 CEOs.

Mr McNamee, who was head of pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd, came in on top as Australia's highest paid CEO with a statutory pay of $19.1 million in 2013.
