A 31-year-old Texas woman has been arrested for allegedly breaking into the home of a male friend of her husbands, before climbing into his bed and sexually assaulting him.

Megan Davis Hoelting has been charged with burglarizing following the alleged incident on Monday night.

It is the fourth time she has been arrested this month.

According to a court record obtained by The Smoking Gun, she entered the victim's house in Williamson County, north of Austin, through an unlocked gate.

Hoelting is said to have been wearing her nightgown at the time, but took it off once inside.

Busy October: It is the fourth time that Texas woman Megan Davis Hoelting, 31, has been arrested this month, following prior charges of theft, public intoxication and assault. She is now being held in jail

Wearing 'only panties', Hoelting allegedly got into bed with the man, grabbed his genitals and attempted to 'perform fellatio upon him'.

The victim was asleep at the time.

He told police he 'awoke to the feeling of an unknown party on top of him' and that 'the offender placed his penis in her mouth', The Smoking Gun reported.

Startled, the man used the light on his phone to see through the dark.

He then realized it was his friend's wife.

The man is said to have asked Hoelting to leave.

However when she refused, he called the police.

Hoelting was arrested and booked into Williamson County lockup.

She was held in custody following three other arrests this month.

On October 14 she was done for theft.

Hoelting was then jailed just two days on an assault charge.

Then on October one was picked up for public intoxication.
