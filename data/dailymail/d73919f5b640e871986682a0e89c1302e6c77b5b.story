Twitter now has more than 270 million users who actively log in and tweet.

But, according to the latest figures, hidden among these active users are approximately 23 million that don't ever visit the microblogging site.

Instead, they pull information from Twitter automatically using other apps, including news aggregators - and it is unsure how many of these are non-human bots.

Twitter classes spam as any user that creates multiple accounts, either manually or using automated tools. 

People who post repeatedly to trending topics to try to grab attention, repeatedly post duplicate updates, and post links with unrelated tweets also violate Twitter's rules.

Spam became such a problem on the site, that in 2012 Twitter filed a suit in federal court in San Francisco against five of the most aggressive tool providers and spammers.

It then launched tools to help users block spam accounts by flagging up suspicious activity to Twitter.

To block spam, clicking the gear icon on a spam account, select 'Block or report' and choose 'This is a spam account'.  

This figure does not include the bot accounts that tweet and push information to the site, according to a Twitter spokesman.

But Twitter will not reveal how many of its 271 monthly active users fall into this latter category.

An additional six million people use Twitter only through services that let people tweet automatically.

Bots on Twitter range from parody to industry accounts.

For example, @big_ben_clock tweets the word ‘bong’ every hour, on the hour, depending on what the time is.

Elsewhere, @MarmiteBot automatically tweets ‘My mate Marmite’ every time someone mentions the spread on Twitter - even if they’re not tweeting the bot directly.

Similarly there are spelling checker bots, Alan Partridge-inspired automatic replies, and a bot that tweets as 'the universe'.

Elsewhere there are spam bots that tweet malicious or promotional links.

Identified spam accounts are not included in this active monthly users figure, but unidentified accounts may be.

In total, Twitter claims around five per cent of all its accounts are false or spam accounts, which at most is 13.5 million. 

In its shareholder filings, Twitter said: ‘In the three months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 11 per cent of all active users solely used third-party applications to access Twitter.

‘However, only up to approximately 8.5 per cent of all active users used third party applications that may have automatically contacted our servers for regular updates without any discernable additional user-initiated action.’

This is said to be lower than expected, however.
