Police are hunting for two young female suspects after a massive early-morning brawl broke out in a Victoria's Secret in a Maryland mall on Black Friday.

A 17-year-old shopper told Anne Arundel County Police that a woman 'poked her in the eye' in Annapolis Mall, sparking a massive melee that was caught on camera by a fellow shopper.

The footage shows the girl standing in the middle of the Black Friday crowd and speaking to another woman, whom she told police she had never seen before.

Fight! A teenager throws a defensive punch after apparently being hit by a fellow shopper in Victoria's Secret in Annapolis Mall in Maryland on Black Friday. Police are now hunting for two suspects

Suddenly, the woman apparently punches her - causing the teen to swipe back. There is no indication what prompts the fight.

Then, with the help of a female friend, the alleged attacker launches herself at the bewildered teenager and begins throwing punches in the crowded store.

The footage, taken by Gary Patrick, shows how the girl is then pushed to the ground with the two suspects on top of her, while other shoppers can do nothing but gasp and watch.

The teenager told police that the suspect was hitting her in the head, according to a statement released by the department.

Eventually, two male store workers pull the girls apart - until one launches herself back at the teenager, apparently hitting her once more as she lies on the ground.

They were split up once more and police were called to the scene at 1.05am. The victim gave her account to cops, claiming the two suspects had approached and assaulted her.

So far, the suspects have not been caught. They are two black females; one was wearing gold earrings with red hair highlights, while the other was wearing a white sweatshirt, as seen in the video.

The investigation is ongoing and is being conducted by the Southern District Detectives. Anyone with information is asked to call 410-222-1965.

It was by no means the only fight caught on camera on Black Friday, which is typically the busiest day of the year as shoppers battle to get their hands on cut-price items.

In one particularly shocking incident, a woman in Philadelphia was filmed apparently using a stun gun on a fellow shopper as they fought.
