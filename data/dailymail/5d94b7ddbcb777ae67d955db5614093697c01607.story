Lottery scratchcards whose £100,000 prizes have already been won are still on sale, an investigation has revealed.

The £2 cards are being sold in shops, supermarkets and petrol stations across the UK – despite the fact that all five top prizes have been claimed.

National Lottery operator Camelot says the £100,000 red Cash cards can legally remain on sale, but Martin Lewis, of the Money Saving Expert website, said: ‘One would hope that if you are buying a scratchcard that advertises a chance to win a £100,000 prize, you actually have a chance.

‘Camelot should be doing everything to
 communicate the situation over the cards or be withdrawing the cards 
and replacing them with a new tranche.

‘I think many people playing would be 
disappointed to know there’s no chance of a dream win. With these cards,
 it truly could not be you.’

About 12million of the cards were printed with the odds of scooping the jackpot standing at almost 2.5million-to-one.

Now all the five jackpots have gone, players have chances to win prizes worth £2 to £5,000.

No problem: National Lottery operator Camelot has said that the continued sale of the scratchcards is legal

The unwinnable cards are still 
available in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Cambridge, 
Plymouth and Glasgow, an investigation by The Sun has revealed.

A Camelot spokesman said: ‘All the top prizes have now been won and we have ceased distribution of the game.

‘However, there are still thousands of
 other prizes available and, as agreed with our regulator [the Gambling Commission], retailers can
 continue to sell the stock they have activated for sale.’

A spokesman for the Advertising 
Standards Authority said last night that it would launch an investigation into alleged advertising irregularlities if any complaints were lodged. Players took to Twitter to voice their 
anger. One user, Bingobrewtew, said: ‘I don’t do it any more, greedy 
Camelot!’

Anger: Camelot already sparked fury by announcing that it will be doubling the price of tickets for its main draws to £2

Harlow MP Robert Halfon tweeted: 
‘Camelot have some serious questions to answer as to whether public are 
being ripped off.’ He earlier questioned: ‘Do we need new National 
Lottery operators? Are Camelot taking us for a ride?’

Lottery chiefs also came under fire 
last month after announcing they were doubling the price of the main 
draws ticket to £2 this autumn.

Camelot, which is owned by a Canadian pension fund, is likely to see huge revenue rises as a result of the price increase.

As well as the rise, average weekend 
jackpots will go up to £5million in a revamp of the main Lotto game. The
 prize for getting three numbers will rise from £10 to £25, and the 
prize for matching four will go from £60 to £100.

A new raffle prize of £20,000 will go to at least 50 Lotto players every week. However, other prizes will fall.

Camelot said research revealed the 
Lotto draw was ‘getting a bit tired and jaded’ and customers wanted 
‘more prizes and more ways to win’.

The announcement provoked widespread 
fury, with a snap poll suggesting that as many as eight out of ten 
players would abandon the National Lottery, which began in 1994. 
Currently, 60 per cent of the public play regularly.
