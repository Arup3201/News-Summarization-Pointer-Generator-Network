Put in the graft: Top chef Marcus Wareing criticised young cooks for chasing 15 minutes of fame on television shows

Top chef Marcus Wareing has criticised young cooks for chasing 15 minutes of fame on television shows like MasterChef.

Wareing, whose restaurant at The Berkeley has two Michelin stars, said trainees needed to put in hours of graft because being on TV was not the key to success.

The 41-year-old, speaking at the launch of Aalto restaurant at Birmingham’s new £24million Hotel La Tour, said his name was not attached to the eatery because diners no longer bought into celebrity chefs in the same way.

He also runs The Gilbert Scott at St Pancras in London but only cooks at Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley.

Asked about his biggest gripe, Wareing said: 'Young chefs who want to be at the top, 
but don’t want to put the work in,' he said.

'Young people come into your kitchen 
judging you rather than us judging them.

'If it carries on the way it is there’s 
going to be no future. There’s no two ways about it, you put the graft 
in whether you like it or not.'

He said the BBC’s MasterChef, presented by Gregg Wallace and John Torode, was a 'brilliant' show.

But he added: 'They can turf out as much as they like. The key to success is longevity, not a five-minute trip on television, five-minute wonder.

'I have more cooks coming to me now 
wanting to know how many hours are they going to do, how many shifts is 
it, what are we going to get paid, how many holidays is it?

'You know what, do me a favour, mate. 
I’ll do it myself. I’d rather do it myself than have some a***hole stand
in my kitchen and think he’s better than me or bigger than me.'

Fame hungry: Wareing said many new recruits thought they could make it to the top simply by appearing on a show like MasterChef, presented by Gregg Wallace and John Torode

The award-winning chef, who has devised Aalto’s menu and supervised the training of staff, was a protege of notoriously bad tempered celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.

Wareing ran Petrus at The Berkeley on behalf of Ramsay, before he took complete control, resulting in a bitter legal feud with his former mentor, who was also his best man.

Wareing later told Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay was a 'sad b*****d', adding, 'if I never speak to that guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit.'

Now, he has called for change in the food world as a whole. 'The industry needs to stop and close 
the door,' he said. 'We need to clamp down.

'There’s a recession on out there at the
moment. It’s not easy. And young people haven’t got a clue.

'If I stood 10 or 15 people in front of 
me between the ages of 16 and 21 and asked them to tell me about the 
depth of the recession, the biggest percentage won’t know.

Wareing said he offered advice to his chefs and front-of-house team.
'I try to wake them up to the reality of life and the world outside,' he said.

'My message to anyone that comes to work with me is if you aren’t prepared to put the effort in go and find a job elsewhere.'
