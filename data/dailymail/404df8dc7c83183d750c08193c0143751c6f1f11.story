Amelie Mauresmo was discreetly seated a few rows back from Kim Sears, wrapped against the almost wintry chill of the French Open’s first week, as Andy Murray began his Roland Garros campaign with an otherwise forgettable win over a Kazakh named Andrey Golubev.

This, it turns out, will go down as the start of another remarkable development in a remarkable career in which the 27-year-old Scot has often shown the propensity to break new ground.

After all, he took on Ivan Lendl when the great Czech had minimal coaching experience, and set a trend that many of his rivals would follow for big-name hirings.

Appointment: Andy Murray, training on Sunday at Queen's, has appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach

Top job: The two-time Grand Slam winner will take over in time for  Queen's

That ended with the 
biggest breakthrough of all, becoming the first British man since Fred 
Perry to win the US Open and Wimbledon.

Now
 he has done it again. Flouting convention, he announced on Sunday — 
with the tennis world agog — that Mauresmo would be his new coach for 
the grass-court season and almost certainly beyond.

With
 the Frenchwoman looking on for the Golubev match, it was notable that 
Murray was mentally dialled in from the start. He attacked the 
first-round tie with the focus that was so often apparent when Lendl 
would sit, solemn and emotionless, in his box.

'Excited': Murray said Mauresmo was someone he 'always looked up to and admired'

Champ: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 and the Australian Open in the same year

HELEN
 COSTA: Costa became the first female manager of a professional football
 club in France after being appointed by Ligue 2 Clermont Foot in May 
this year. She had previously managed the women’s national teams of 
Qatar and Iran. Clermont player Anthony Lippi said: “It will be a unique
 experience... It creates a buzz.”

TERESA PHILLIPS: Phillips 
made history in 2003 by becoming the first woman to coach a men’s 
top-level NCAA basketball team. She took charge of Tennessee State 
University’s Tigers for one game when the regular coach was suspended 
mid-season. The Tigers lost, and Phillips reverted to her role as the 
school’s athletics director.

EVA LUND: Swedish curler Lund 
won double world and Olympic gold in her playing career. She was 
appointed coach of Nicklas Edin’s men’s team for the 2014 Winter 
Olympics, where they missed out on a bronze medal in a final stone loss 
to Great Britain. Lund said: “If you have a different perspective as a 
woman, you bring more value.”

MARGOT WELLS: The former 
Scottish sprint champion turned to coaching and was never far from 
husband Alan’s side as he swept to Olympic gold and silver medals at the
 1980 Moscow Olympics. She still works closely with a number of elite 
male rugby union and hockey players.

BARBARA WILLIAMS: 
Williams became the first female ice hockey coach in the history of the 
NHL when she was named power skating instructor for the New York 
Islanders in 1977. She worked with the Islanders through four Stanley 
Cup wins before moving on to become a skating coach with the New Jersey 
Devils.

When
 Lendl departed the scene in March, Murray quickly worked out that it 
would be impossible to find a like-for-like replacement for someone who 
had given him that marginal edge which all champions seek. Multiple 
Grand Slam winners from the men’s game are few in number, and when you 
look for one who is prepared to return to the treadmill of the circuit —
 and who is temperamentally suitable — their ranks evaporate altogether.

And
 so he thought outside the tramlines, as this intelligent and innovative
 individual has so often been prepared to do. Why not look at a woman, 
and to hell with anyone who might sneer at the notion.

That
 is what led him to contact 2006 Wimbledon Champion Mauresmo prior to 
Roland Garros, as Sportsmail suggested following the Golubev match.

Many

 in men’s tennis privately look down on the women’s game, but Murray has
 never been one of them. He is intrigued by the WTA Tour and, for 
example, took to Twitter last week to say how much he had enjoyed 
watching the emerging American teenage talent, Taylor Townsend.

Of
 course it is a well-known part of the Murray narrative that the driving
 force in his development was his mother Judy, who has one of the 
shrewdest tennis brains you will ever encounter.She
 is one of numerous mothers who have had a major impact on bringing 
their son through to the professional ranks, with all the commitment 
which that takes, and who have retained a significant influence.

Previous: Mauresmo already has experience of coaching man, having worked with Michael Llodra

Exit: Murray lost to Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris

Jimmy
 Connors’s mother Gloria was another famous example as was Marat Safin’s
 mother Rausa. But it is unprecedented in modern times for a player from
 the true elite to have a woman from outside the family travelling as a 
major part of the team.

There
 are a couple of current top-100 players who have put their faith in 
women as their outright coaches but they are family. One is Uzbekistan’s
 Denis Istomin, who is coached by his mother, and the other is the 
Russian-Kazakh Mikhail Kukushkin, whose coach is his wife Anastasia.

They
 will be familiar with the few inconveniences such an arrangement 
brings. I remember trying to seek out Istomin the day before Murray 
played him at the US Open last year and seeing his mother waiting on a 
bench outside the locker room to have a chat as she was obviously not 
able to enter.

Tonic: Murray will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of Nadal

Mauresmo
 has experience of what it is like to be a woman in this particular 
man’s world. She coached Frenchman Michael Llodra during the 2010 
grass-court season, when he won the Eastbourne ATP event.

She
 is currently captain of the French Fed Cup team (the opposite number of
 Judy Murray with the Great Britain team) and was on the support staff 
of Marion Bartoli when she won Wimbledon last year.

So
 she knows how to win, and can also empathise with the severe pressures 
Murray faces in being by far and away the best player in the nation that
 hosts Wimbledon.

Contact: Mauresmo said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks

Long term: Mauresmo suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis

Mikhail
 Kukushkin is coached by his wife, Anastiasa Kukushkina, and Denis 
Istomin by his mother, Klaudiya Istomia, while, of high-profile former 
players, Gloria Connors was a hugely influential figure in son Jimmy’s 
career.

Former top-10 player
 Andrei Chesnokov was coached by Tatiana Naumko for virtually his whole 
career and Billie Jean King briefly coached Tim Mayotte.

Despite
 winning two other Majors, she found it hard to produce at her home 
Grand Slam. The best she managed at Roland Garros was two quarter-final 
appearances.

She
 and Murray have much in common. Away from the court, on which he is 
ferociously competitive, Murray is a thoughtful type with a gentle and 
sensitive side that would surprise some, and the softly spoken Mauresmo 
is similar. You can imagine the two of them being able to communicate 
well.

On 
the technical side she was an unusually fine volleyer among the women 
and this is a side of his game that Murray could do with employing more.

But
 there will undoubtedly be sceptics, and Murray loves nothing more than 
proving those wrong. He will want to make this work and unless he finds 
the arrangement deeply unsatisfactory early on they clearly plan for it 
to continue well beyond Wimbledon.

They
 actually have  a tough start together. Weary from Roland Garros, Murray
 has a very quick turnaround from Paris on to the grass at the Aegon 
Championships this week, and then comes his defence of the Wimbledon 
title.

What a fascinating journey it promises to be.
