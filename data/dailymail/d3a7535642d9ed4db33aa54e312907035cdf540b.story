Rebuke: Tom Hayes was told off by a judge for having his hands in his pockets as he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court

A former City banker accused of plotting to rig Libor interest rates was told to take his hands out of his pockets by a judge yesterday.

Tom Hayes, 33, who used to work for UBS and Citigroup, allegedly conspired to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is used to determine the interest on loans between banks, from 2006 to 2010.

At one point during a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, District Judge Quentin Purdy rebuked him for not abiding by court etiquette.

‘Take your hands out of your pockets please,’ he told Hayes, who was dressed in a dark grey open-neck shirt and pale grey trousers.

Hayes was arrested last December as part of a massive criminal inquiry into the scandal by the Serious Fraud Office.

The charges against him relate to a period between August 2006 and September 2010, and allege that he acted ‘with the intention that the economic interests of others would be prejudiced and/or to make personal gain for themselves or another’.

Dressed in a dark grey open-neck shirt and pale grey trousers, he spoke only to confirm his identity during a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

At one point, District Judge Quentin Purdy rebuked Hayes for not abiding by court etiquette.

‘Take your hands out of your pockets please,’ he told Hayes.

Lydia Jonson, defending, said her client was not yet prepared to formally enter pleas to the eight charges.

Under his bail conditions, he is required to surrender his passport to the police, sign in regularly with a police station near to his home, and not to leave England and Wales.

He is also forbidden from contacting, directly or indirectly, any of a number of named individuals.

Mukul Chawla QC, prosecuting, asked for the individuals not to be named in open court because of a ‘sensitivity’, which he did not expand upon.

Adjourning proceedings, Judge Purdy said: ‘I’m formally sending you for trial on all eight charges to appear at the crown court sitting at Southwark for a preliminary hearing on July 4.

‘I must tell you that if you are not there, and there is no good reason, a warrant will be issued under the Bail Act and a trial could take place in your absence without further warning.’

Hayes, of Woldingham, Caterham, Surrey, faces eight counts of conspiring to defraud.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
