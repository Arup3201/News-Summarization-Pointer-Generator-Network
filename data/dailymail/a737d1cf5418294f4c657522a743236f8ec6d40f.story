A mechanic has told how he forced open a refrigerated yogurt truck to free suspected illegal immigrants who he thought were dying.

The 24 Africans had been frantically banging on the sides of the lorry, parked in Whitfield, near Dover in Kent, in a bid to alert passers-by. 

The immigrants, all young male and female Eritrean nationals, are thought to have been concealed in the trailer for hours before being released.

A mechanic has told how he forced open a refrigerated yogurt truck to free suspected illegal immigrants who he thought were dying

The trailer, which was carrying a cargo of yoghurt, had travelled on a lorry on a cross-Channel ferry from France to Dover.

It is not known how long the men and women had been in the truck before they left Calais and were later found in a street in Whitfield at around 11.50am on Friday.

Andy Groombridge, 44, a mechanic who runs a nearby vehicle repair business, said: 'I had to act quickly because I thought people might be dying in the back of the lorry. They were screaming for help.

'I managed to break the security seal on the trailer. As I opened the doors I could see there was a large group of them, all gasping for air.

'They desperately needed oxygen so they staggered out into the air and just kept breathing in the air. They were shouting "oxygen, oxygen".

'They were all really hot and sweaty and looked very dazed and tired.'

Mr Groombridge said he had been eating breakfast when he 'heard the commotion' and saw other people standing by the lorry who said they had contacted police. 

But he said police were 'taking too long' and that the voices were 'getting more desperate'.

'We were told not to open it but the people were banging more and more frantically for help,' he said.

'As they came out I could see men and women, all young, aged around 18-20. I counted 24 in total.

'After a while they seemed ok but two of them were sick. They said they had been eating the yoghurts inside the lorry.

'All of them seemed very relieved to be out of the lorry. We sat them on the floor and eventually they were smiling and texting on their phones.

'The police turned up around 10-15 minutes later and took them away.

'I saw the driver, he was Hungarian and he was in shock. He had no idea they were in his lorry.' 

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'We were called after a group of suspected illegal immigrants were found in the back of a lorry in Whitfield.

'Officers arrested one man on suspicion of facilitation offences.'

A Port of Dover spokesman confirmed: 'A vehicle was detained at Whitfield containing 24 Eritrean nationals.

'Port of Dover Police assisted and the matter has now been passed over to Kent Police and Border Force.'

The incident comes just days after a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it was being driven from Calais to a suburban road in Kent

It comes just two days after six illegal immigrants were found in the back of a grain lorry in Kent. 

Last week, a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it drove from Calais to a suburban road in Kent.

The man, believed to be in his late teens, is thought to have tied himself to the chassis of the vehicle before it entered the Channel Tunnel.

He emerged after the two-hour journey as Paul Coles and his daughter, Joanne, were returning the vehicle to its owner in  Ashford.

 

Government to give £12million to join Anglo-French plan to tackle problem of illegal immigrants in Calais hoping to get to Britain 

The UK Government will provide £12 million over three years to help tackle the problem of illegal immigrants at Calais hoping to gain entry to Britain.

Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve reached a deal which will also see increased co-operation between the two countries' law enforcement agencies.

The joint plan will also involve bolstering security at the French port, which has seen increasing number of migrants using it as a staging post for efforts to cross the English Channel.

Security and Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: 'Earlier today the Home Secretary and French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve set out a number of joint commitments to tackle problems at the port of Calais, including bolstering security.

'Their declaration also reaffirms their commitment to closer working by UK and French law enforcement agencies to target organised crime gangs behind people trafficking and smuggling.

'And the two countries will continue to push for action at European and international level to address the wider problem of illegal migration, of which Calais is just one very visible sign.

'The priority now is to implement the practical solutions that have been agreed.' 

A joint statement issued by Mrs May and Mr Cazeneuve set out plans to reduce the number of illegal migrants, including information campaigns and strengthened security.

They also promised to 'respond to health emergencies and protect vulnerable people', particularly victims of human trafficking, but insisted that the measures would not encourage immigrants to gather in Calais.

The UK will contribute five million euros (£4million) a year for three years to a joint intervention fund to help tackle the problems in Calais

The statement said they would 'ensure that all measures taken will deter illegal migrants from congregating in and around Calais'.

The UK will contribute five million euros (£4million) a year for three years to a joint intervention fund.

Some of the money will be used to construct robust fences and increase security in the parking area at the port.

Officials from both countries will work to improve the quality of border controls, possibly including the installation of new technology to address the dangers of migrants hiding in tankers and refrigerated lorries.

The statement added: 'At the same time, efforts will be made to strengthen operational co-operation by establishing permanent joint mechanisms to deliver promptly the comprehensive action plan and enhance co-operation between British and French law enforcement agencies at the border.

'This will include helping to identify measures to ensure migrants do not breach the laws of either country or threaten the safety of Calais residents or those using the port. It will also support improved joint returns initiatives and further comprehensive action against those trying to evade immigration control.'

The joint plan will also involve bolstering security at the French port, which has seen increasing number of migrants using it as a staging post for efforts to cross the English Channel

Information campaigns starting next month will explain "the reality of illegal migration and its consequences in the United Kingdom" and also set out information on asylum in France or assisted voluntary return.

Police and border agencies on both sides will co-operate to tackle the organised criminal networks responsible for people smuggling.

The National Crime Agency will second a full-time office to Ocriest, the French agency responsible for tackling illegal immigration, while the French border police will send two officers each month to work with the joint border intelligence unit in Folkestone.

The ministers also resolved to push for European Union action on an "evident migration crisis" in the Mediterranean Sea.
