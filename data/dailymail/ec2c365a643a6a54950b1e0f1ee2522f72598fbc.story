The biggest crowds in a decade have raced through the doors of Australian department stores and other shops to kick off Friday's Boxing Day sales.

Thousands of shoppers were seen pouring through the doors of David Jones and Myer when their flagship stores opened their doors at 5am.

In Sydney, model Jesinta Campbell rang the bell to signal the beginning of David Jones' clearance sale.

Australian shoppers will splurge more than $2 billion on retail therapy if Boxing Day sale predictions pan out.

David Jones chief Iain Nairn said in the first five hours, his stores had raked in just over $4.4 million.

Mr Nairn said the most popular items by far were designer handbags, with early bird shoppers buying up bags marked down by 80 per cent.

Tony Sutton, Myer executive general manager, could not confirm sales figures but said crowds were the biggest the department store had seen in 10 years.

'We had up to a thousand lining up before 5am – the first customers lined up at 7.30pm last night,' Mr Sutton said.

But some shoppers in Myer's Bourke Street Mall store in Melbourne were left disappointed after misleading handwriting on vouchers led them to think they had been gifted a $201 voucher when it was only valid for $20, the Herald Sun reported.

The store apologised for any 'confusion' after receiving complaints that a dash written after the '$20' looked like a '1'.

Mr Sutton said the most popular items so far had been menswear, with the store selling 50 business shirts a minute. 

He added that ladies shoes and heavily discounted Christmas decorations and wrapping were also selling quickly.

Australian National Retailers Association chief Anna McPhee said consumer confidence was on the rise.

If Boxing Day sale predictions come true Australian shoppers will splurge more than $2 billion

Shops around the country will take in more than $16 billion over the next three weeks

'Cheap petrol prices particularly are putting extra dollars in people's wallets,' Ms McPhee said.

'Low interest rates across the year have also been boosting household budgets.' 

Retailers expect shops around the country will take in more than $16 billion over the next three weeks, including a $2.072 billion boon on Boxing Day alone.

If so, it would be the first time Australian shoppers have spent more than $2 billion in a single day.

Victorian consumers will lead the post-Christmas shopping binge according to the Australian Retailers Association, spending about $682 million on Boxing Day while NSW is expected to fork out $584 million.

ARA executive director Russell Zimmerman slammed 'ludicrous' retail regulations in New South Wales (NSW) preventing shops outside the city's CBD from opening their doors early on Boxing Day.

'NSW is Australia's most populous state, and yet Victoria easily takes the cake when it comes to expected Boxing Day sales,' Mr Zimmerman said on Thursday.

'This equals a $98 million loss of trade to NSW retailers, with absurd and outdated trading restrictions largely to blame.'

'Consumers can buy online 24/7 but many bricks and mortar stores are still unable to open on, what is for many, the largest trading day of the year.'

Australian shoppers aged 14 or older will spend an average of $850 each between Boxing Day and January 15.

Shopping centres are going to be opening their doors earlier than usual on Boxing Day to accommodate the influx of shoppers, with David Jones stores in Sydney and Melbourne CBDs opening at 5am.
