Davion Only's biological family are still desperate to have him live with them, telling MailOnline,  'He's our blood.... We want to be part of his life'.

Orphaned teen, Davion, 16, stole the hearts of people round the world last year when he made an impassioned plea from a church pulpit for a, 'forever family' to adopt him.

It looked like he had finally got his wish when a minister and his wife took him into their Ohio home just after spring break.

But yesterday news broke that he had apparently got into a physical confrontation with another boy in the house and had been sent back to a children's home in Pinellas County, Florida, leaving his dreams of a normal life in tatters.

Davion Only, 16, captured the hears of America when he pleaded for a 'forever family' at a church in Florida in September. News broke last week that he was back in a group home

Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record

Davion was taken into care as a baby after being born to drug addict La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud, in the Clearwater area of Florida.

She died last summer, something that apparently inspired Davion to make his emotional church speech.

Today McCloud's sister, Davion's aunt, Doris Barnes said the family were devastated at the news their relative was back in care, but repeated their desire to have him live with them.

She is convinced her nephew sometimes rebels because he knows he has a real family out there, who he wants to live with.

They have spent time with him over the last few months, but have apparently not been considered for permanent adoption, partly because some members of the family have criminal convictions.

Davion is due to spend July 4th celebrating with them in their home town of Clearwater.

Speaking to MailOnline, Doris, 54, said: 'His cousin just picked him today. Davion is going to spend today with his family at his cousin's house.

Davion was taken in by an Ohio pastor and his wife. However, he was kicked out and sent back to Florida after he got into a physical fight with one of the pastor's children

'We're going to have a meal and talk to him. We are very upset that this information has got out. It shouldn't have been leaked.

'Who in their right mind is going to want to take him now? He has made a mistake, but he is still just a boy.

'I want to be part of his life, he is my family and my blood. I have a conviction from 14 years ago and haven't been In trouble since, but the way the system works I can't adopt him.

'No family is perfect, but this shows why he needs to be with his real family. We just want to be there for him.'

She added: 'I think maybe he is acting up because he knows he has real family out there. I believe he wants to be with us and I believe that when he gets old enough he will come back to us anyway.'

It is a major setback for Davion, who thought he had finally got the family he had always wanted.

After Davion made his impassioned appeal, a minister and his wife flew Davion up to Ohio to visit over spring break. They introduced him to their three children and took him to church. Davion came back to Florida just long enough to pack a small suitcase.

Davion turned his life around after his mother died in an attempt to get adopted by a family

Then he returned to Ohio, where the prospective parents signed him up to play football - something he had always wanted to do.

'I got baptized!' he wrote April 20, from his new phone, on his new Facebook page.

The
 adoption could take place in 90 days, said Terri Durdaller, whose 
agency, Eckerd, oversees Tampa Bay's foster children. That would have 
meant that Davion could have been adopted this month.

Instead, he is back in Pinellas County, at a therapeutic foster home, 'upset and embarrassed, unwilling to talk.'

'There
 was an incident in Ohio,' said Eckerd's director, Lorita Shirley. At 
one point, she said, things got physical between Davion and another 
child in the house, and with the dad. The family wanted him out.

On May 30, Davion's case manager flew to Ohio and brought him back to Florida.

'This has been a major setback for him,' Shirley said. 'Our goal now is to get him treatment.'

After
 discovering his biological mother was dead last summer, Davion, who had
 previously been in trouble at school, decided to turn his life around 
and finally get out of foster care.

He
 went to the gym and lost 40 pounds. Last fall, he buckled down at 
school, started getting A's. He tried to control his temper, be the kind
 of kid someone would want.

'I'll take anyone,' Davion said last September. 'Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care.'

'I
 know God hasn't given up on me,' he told the packed congregation at St.
 Mark Missionary Baptist Church. 'So I'm not giving up either.'

His story went national. After appearing on the front page of the Tampa Bay Times on October 8, Davion's plea was picked up by news outlets across the world. Producers of The View flew him to New York to talk to Barbara Walters.

More than 10,000 strangers called offering to help or adopt him. Eckerd workers returned 2,500 of those calls, said Durdaller, the agency's spokeswoman.

At first, Eckerd officials tried to connect Davion with a second cousin, a sheriff's deputy who learned of Davion through the newspaper. When that didn't work, they moved him from the group home to be with a foster family. But that family never intended to adopt Davion.

In early March, Davion called his former adoption specialist to say, 'I had a blowout.' The foster family refused to keep him.

But it was okay, Davion said then. He had met this great couple from Ohio. A minister and his wife with a bunch of kids.

They said they wanted him. Finally, someone wanted him.

'On paper, this was the book-definition perfect family for him,' said Shirley, Eckerd's director. 'The father was a pastor who had worked with troubled kids. They knew about Davion's background and his issues.'

'The biggest thing that went wrong is that Davion spent 15 years in the system,' said Shirley. 'He has a lot of built up anger. It's been very devastating for everyone involved.'

Eckerd therapists refused to let Davion talk to the media. He didn't respond to Facebook messages. He no longer has a cellphone.

The Ohio family didn't respond to requests either.

'Davion is a maturing young man whose perspective on life continues to change as it does with most teenagers,' reads a statement from Eckerd.

'After Davion spent time with a prospective adoptive family this spring, it was determined that the family was not the right fit for him, with that we are asking for privacy during this stage of his life.'

Since September, when Davion asked God and strangers for help, he has been moved away from his friends at his group home and school. He has lost his adoptions specialist. And he has cycled through four families.

His mentor, 22-year-old Richard Prince, said he hasn't seen Davion since he was sent back to Florida.

'I'm extremely worried about him,' Prince said. 'We had a short conversation a couple of weeks ago, but it was very unsettling.'

Eckerd's  website has its own page devoted to Davion, which has raised money and awareness about other teenagers in foster care. 'I am currently matched with a family,' says his profile.

Which is no longer true.

'When he is ready, we will continue down the list of people who have expressed interest in him,' said Shirley. 'Now, we might be looking at empty-nesters, people who raised teenagers but don't have any other kids in their house. That might be the best match for him.'

Since September, when Davion took the pulpit, 339 children in Pinellas and Pasco counties have been adopted.

But the boy who became the face for older adoption, whose 'Davion Effect' was touted in Tallahassee and on TV talk shows, is still alone.
