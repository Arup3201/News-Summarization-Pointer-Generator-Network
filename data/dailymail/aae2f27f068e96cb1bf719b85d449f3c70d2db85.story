Five-year-old Skyler Burns looks every inch a happy and beautiful little girl.

But in fact the youngster was born a boy called Seth and has been diagnosed by gender dysphoria.

Her parents Summer and Brett have now made the decision to allow their child to live her life as a girl.

A new life: Five-year-old Skyler Burns looks every inch a happy and beautiful little girl

According to Mr and Mrs Burns they knew Skyler was different to their four other sons when she began playing with toys designed for girls and refused to use the men's toilets. 

But they became concerned when they found her crying after Mrs Burns handed out boy-themed invitations for his fourth party.

'One of his pets had died that week and we gave him a little burial in the garden', Mrs Burns told 9News.

'He was curled up in the foetal position sobbing... and he told me from under the bed that he'd rather be dead like his pet in the garden than be a boy', he told A Current Affair.

His parents decided to take him to see a GP as well as specialists and after months of appointments, Skyler was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. 

She will have to take medication to block puberty when she is 11 and if she decides to carry on with her decision, Skyler will be given oestrogen and can have surgery.

Mrs Burns added: 'It's hard to put a dress on your son and send him off into the world but in the end it's her happiness.'

Difficult decision: Skyler was born a boy called Seth but says she wants to live her life as a girl

Psychologist Linda Madalin said her parents have made the right decision.

She said: 'If this is what the child needs for her physiological wellbeing then that is more important than what other people think.

Next year Skyler will start school as a girl and is looking forward to wearing a dress.

Gender dysphoria is a condition in which a person feels that there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity.

Biological sex is assigned at birth, depending on the appearance of the infant. Gender identity is the gender that a person 'identifies' with, or feels themselves to be.

For example, a person may have the anatomy of a man, but gender identify as a woman.

Others do not describe themselves as either male or female, or may describe themselves as agender.

This mismatch can cause feelings of discomfort that are called gender dysphoria.

Gender dysphoria is a recognised condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate.
