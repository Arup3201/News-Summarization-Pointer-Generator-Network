DICTATORS' DINNERS

by Victoria Clark & Melissa Scott

(Gilgamesh Publishing £14.95) 

How many cookery books do you have? Lots? More than lots? An absolutely ridiculous number?

Power-hungry: Ugandan tyrant Idi Amin 

The problem is that there’s always one more that you have to have, even when you think you have collected the set.

Dictators’ Dinners is subtitled A Bad Taste Guide To Entertaining Tyrants, and if there’s even the smallest chance of you having to feed Robert Mugabe or Kim Jong-Un one evening, you are going to need it on your shelf.

Victoria Clark and Melissa Scott have approached their task with great clarity and simplicity. They profile 26 dictators, all from the 20th century, from Hitler and Mussolini in Europe, to Pol Pot in the East and ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier in the West.

They describe their culinary preferences, and then give us the recipe for one of their favourite dishes.

Rarely, if ever, have the depths of human depravity and haute cuisine been so stylishly combined in a single book. Stalin enjoyed long, severely alcoholic meals: when he referred to ‘a bite to eat’, he was usually talking about a six-hour feast, cooked by his favourite chef, Vladimir Putin’s grandfather. After one such snack, Marshal Tito vomited in his jacket sleeve; after another, Nikita Khrushchev was discovered to have wet his bed.

Hitler was, as we know, a vegetarian, but more because he had a tender concern for animals than because he didn’t like the taste. On several occasions in the Thirties, he wolfed down fledgling pigeon stuffed with tongue, liver and pistachio nuts, and reportedly remarked that there was ‘nothing better than a liver dumpling’.

He had 15 food-tasters, and only if none of them had dropped dead within 45 minutes of tasting a dish was it deemed safe for the Fuhrer. He must have eaten a lot of lukewarm food.

How did paella become Spain’s national dish? Because it was thought to be General Franco’s favourite, so no Madrid restaurant could afford to leave it off the menu, just in case he popped in for lunch.

Nicolae Ceausescu travelled with a mobile laboratory to analyse any food he was offered. If it hadn’t been screened and approved, he shovelled everything he was served at formal banquets straight on to the floor and kicked it as far away from him as possible.

Saddam Hussein had 20 palaces, and kitchen staff at each of them prepared three meals a day for him whether he was there or not.

He had his eldest son beaten up and thrown in jail for clubbing one of his food‑tasters to death. His usual breakfast was camel milk with bread and honey.

After Hussein was captured in 2003, a nearly empty box of Bounty bars was found in his hideout.

Colonel Gaddafi liked camel milk, too, but it may have been the cause of his legendary flatulence. On a visit to his tent in 2004, Tony Blair was advised not to accept a glass, lest he be similarly afflicted.

Hastings Banda of Malawi favoured mopane worms, the large caterpillars of the emperor moth, especially when dried and eaten as a snack like crisps.

Both Emperor Bokassa of the Central African Republic and Idi Amin of Uganda were rumoured to eat human flesh. Amin denied it: ‘It’s too salty for me.’ Instead he ate up to 40 oranges a day.

One state banquet he hosted included bee larvae, green bush crickets, cicadas, flying ants and locusts. (Wash your crickets thoroughly and fry them with a little onion and garlic, with salt and pepper to taste.)

Mao Tse-tung was a chronic insomniac who regularly took sleeping pills before dinner and fell asleep while he was eating, leaving attendants to fish any remaining food from his mouth.

Ferdinand Marcos’s shoe-crazed wife Imelda, flying to Rome in their private plane, ordered the pilot to turn back because they had forgotten to bring cheese.

According to his sushi chef, Korea’s Kim Jong-Il ‘enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing’.

Maybe the most serious foodie dictator, though, was Fidel Castro, who was extolling the virtues of plain, fresh ingredients decades before Jamie Oliver was born.

His favourite soup involved a plain, fresh, endangered species — the sea turtle. Clark and Scott reproduce the recipe here but, happily, leave the turtle out of it.

Their magnificent book is alternately mouth-watering and stomach-turning. I wonder what’s for dinner?
