An alleged Florida fraudster charged with stealing dozens of people's identities in order to file fake tax returns pleaded with a court for a lighter sentence, saying he has turned his life around.

Derek Denesevich, 26, of Lauderhill, paid a Broward Clerk of Courts employee to steal drivers identities from a state database in 2011 and 2012, in a scam that netted him $57,238.

Despite a raft of distinctive facial tattoos and piercings - including the logo for luxury car dealer Bentley across his forehead - Denesevich was still able to pretend to be other people, filing about 80 fraudulent income tax returns, according to WPTV.

He was facing four and a half years in prison and has a long list of prior convictions, including illegal possession of an alligator, robbery, firearm and drug offenses.

Reformed: Derek Denesevich, 26, pleaded for a lighter sentence on crimes of aggravated identity theft, saying he has turned his life around, starting with the attempted removal of his facial tattoos

However Denesevich said he is actively trying to reform, starting with several months of tattoo removal treatment to rid his face of ink.

He has also gone undercover for the FBI to help catch a team of identity and tax fraudsters.

Denesevich wore a wire as part of the plot, which lead to the arrest of six people who had stolen more than 1,200 identities.

At his sentencing hearing on Friday, the court heard how Denesevrich fled to Canada in 2012 after police approached him over his crimes.

However he returned to South Florida following the birth of his son.

'I came back here for my son,' Denesevich told the judge, according to WPTV.

'I'm extremely sorry to my victims.'

FBI agents also appeared in court to corroborate Denesevich's work for them.

As a result he received a sentence of one year and three months, following by three years of supervised release.

However he must pay back the $57,328 he stole as part of his tax fraud scheme.

Part of the money will be paid by Porscha Kyles, the Clerk of Courts employee who helped him with the scam.

She is serving three years for her crimes.

Although he is trying to erase his facial tattoos, Denesevich is said to have a tattoo on his back featuring his own face, complete with the Bentley logo on his forehead.
