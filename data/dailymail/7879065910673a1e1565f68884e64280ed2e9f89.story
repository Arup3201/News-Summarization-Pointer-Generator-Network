Cult television series Game of Thrones was the most illegally downloaded show in America this year, new data suggests.

Fans of the fantasy show downloaded the epic third series finale 5.9million times via file sharing service BitTorrent, a piracy monitoring site claims.

The figures suggest more people watched the finale via the site than when it aired on cable - which pulled in 5.5million viewers.

Popular: The third series finale of Games of Thrones, a still from series three pictured, was the most downloaded show in the US this year

Views: 5.5million fans watched the finale of the show when it aired on cable, meaning half of those who watched it did so illegally

This means over half of those who watched the closing episode did so illegally.

Over half of downloads took place the week after the final episode, piracy site TorrentFreak also found.

This is the second year in a row the show - which is an adaptation of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R. R. Martin - was the most downloaded.

Other popular television shows also featured highly in the top downloaded list.

Second: Breaking Bad was downloaded 4.2million times on file-sharing site BitTorrent

1     Game of Thrones 5,900,000    

2     Breaking Bad 4,200,000    

3     The Walking Dead 3,600,000    

4     The Big Bang Theory 3,400,000    

5     Dexter 3,100,000   

6     How I Met Your Mother 3,000,000    

7     Suits 2,600,000    

8     Homeland 2,400,000    

9     Vikings 2,300,000    

10   Arrow 2,200,000  

Neflix's hugely popular Breaking Bad was downloaded 4.2million times, putting it second behind Game of Thrones. The Walking Dead was third with 3.6million.

Homeland, The Big Bang Theory, Dexter, How I Met Your Mother, Vikings and Suits also received high numbers of downloads.

TorrentFreak created the list but anaylising data from BitTorrent - which publishes its streaming statistics.

TorrentFreak's founder, Ernesto Van Der Sar, confessed the list is based only on BitTorrent data - which he says accounts for around half of all illegal downloads in the US.

The list does not include shows pirated from other websites.

Speaking with Broadcastingcable.com, he said: 'There is no way to accurately count the completed downloads, so it is an estimate.'
