Steven Gerrard took time to reflect upon the All-Stars charity match held at Anfield on Sunday by uploading a picture with two of his favourite former Liverpool team-mates to Instagram.

Gerrard shared a picture of himself alongside Xabi Alonso and Luis Suarez, with the Liverpool captain holding a signed plaque commemorating the game.

The charity match pitted two teams, one captained by Gerrard and one by Jamie Carragher, against each other with an array of stars descending on Anfield for the day.

Gerrard was delighted to be joined by the likes of Suarez and Alonso and the match ended in a 2-2 draw.

Gerrard scored both penalties for his team as Carragher's side surrendered a two-goal advantage which had been established through strikes by Mario Balotelli and Didier Drogba.

Former Reds such as Fernando Torres, Alvaro Arbeloa, Pepe Reina and Luis Garcia also returned to Anfield for the game in aid of the Liverpool FC Foundation.
