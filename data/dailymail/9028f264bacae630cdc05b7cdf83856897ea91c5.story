A 59-year-old man was lucky to survive a bear attack in George Washington National Forest on Thursday, after his trusted pet Labrador came to the rescue and helped fend off the angry animal.

Steven Krichbaum, 59, of Staunton, Virginia, was walking in the woods in Hardy County, West Virginia with his pet, a yellow Labrador mix named Henry, when they came upon a black bear and two cubs.

Fearing for her cubs safety, the bear’s primary instinct was to attack Krichbaum and his dog.

Henry’s bravery helped save his master’s life. While he fought with the bear, it allowed Krichbaum time to repeatedly strike the animal with a rock.

Both dog and owner were seriously injured in the struggle, but despite bleeding profusely Krichbaum was able to drive his Suburu station wagon out the park, reports WHSV.

Dazed and not familiar with the area, Krichbaum struggled to locate a hospital and so stopped at Richards Fruit Market in search of assistance.

Owner Eddie Richard told NV Daily that the station wagon pulled into his parking lot at about 1 p.m. with both the driver and dog covered in blood.

'He was really bleeding out,' said Richard. 'He had a huge open gash on his forearm.'

Richard’s wife Nancy called an ambulance while she and a friend, Cathy Patterson, used towels and a bandanna to try and stop the bleeding.

Krichbaum's wounds included a hole the size of a 50-cent coin in one of his upper thighs and scratch marks.

'He had claw marks and gashes,' Patterson said.

Henry had also suffered from wounds, mostly to one of his hind legs.

After being treated by an ambulance crew for about 25 minutes, Krichbaum was transported to Winchester Medical Center.

Henry was taken by the Frederick County Sheriff's Animal Control unit to a local emergency animal hospital. 

Both are expected to be okay.
