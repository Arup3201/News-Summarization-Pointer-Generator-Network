David Cameron has fallen out of a list of the top ten most powerful people in the world for the first time since he became Prime Minister.

Forbes magazine now ranks him less important than Michael Duke, chief executive of Wal-Mart, which owns Asda.

Now ranked 11th, having fallen one place, Mr Cameron is derided by the influential US business magazine for ‘a flip-flop approach to green taxes’.

Supermarket sweep: David Cameron has dropped out of the top 10 of the Forbes Power list for the first time since becoming Prime Minister, making way for Wal-Mart President and CEO Michael Duke

It
 added: ‘The Conservative PM guides the world’s sixth-largest economy 
and was once hailed as the second coming of Margaret Thatcher. No more.’

It marks a dramatic drop for Mr Cameron, 
who only two years ago was ranked seventh most powerful person in the 
world after sweeping in to power.

Confirming his position at 11th 
on the list, the magazine added: ‘He has recently been criticised for a 
flip-flop approach to green taxes after he pledged to slash the tax on 
household energy bills amid soaring gas and electricity prices.

‘He has two years to galvanise the Tories ahead of a 2015 general election.’

Top two: Russian President Vladimr Putin is ranked number one most powerful person in the world, while US President Barack Obama is number two

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is number five, down from number two last year Pope Francis has moved up one place to number four

1. Vladimir Putin, President, Russia (3 in 2012)

2. Barack Obama, President, United States (2)

3. Xi Jinping, General Secretary, Communist Party, China (9)

4. Pope Francis (5)

5. Angela Merkel, Chancellor, Germany (2)

6. Bill Gates, Co-Chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (4)

7. Ben Bernanke, Chairman, US Federal Reserve (6)

8. Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia (7)

9. Mario Draghi, President, European Central Bank (8)

10. Michael Duke, CEO, Wal-Mart Stores (17)

11. David Cameron, UK Prime Minister (10)

Mr Cameron will also feel uncomfortable that in the 500-word citation, the magazine also notes that he is and ‘Oxford graduate and (illegitimate) descendent of King William IV (1830-1837)’.

Three years ago Forbes said Mr Cameron ‘shares the Iron Lady's determination to slash government expenditures’.

But since then it has grown increasingly unimpressed with the Tory leader, warning last year how he faced a ‘disillusioned electorate and rumblings from his own party over Britain's future’.

By comparison the 2012 Power List notes how Mr Duke is chief of the world's number one retailer and biggest private employer, with 2.2 million workers.

It adds: ‘Wal-Mart can make or break a company simply by deciding to stock its product.’

Wal-Mart bought UK supermarket chain Asda in 1999, and it now employees 175,000 people in the UK.

Forbes’
 annual list, chosen by the influential magazine’s editors, has also 
demoted Barack Obama who had been number one every year since he was 
elected US president in 2009.

He has become a ‘lame duck’, says the 
magazine which puts him at number two behind Vladimir Putin despite the 
Russian leader’s terrible record on human rights.

Michael Noer, 
executive editor at Forbes, said: ‘There is a fundamental difference 
between a good person and a powerful person. If we were doing a list of 
the most palatable people in the world it would be very different.’

Chinese premier Xi Jinping is at number three in the list up from ninth last year, Pope Francis number four, up one, and German chancellor Angela Merkel was the top-placed woman at number five, down from number two in 2012.

Microsoft tycoon and philanthropist Bill Gates takes the sixth place, down from fourth, US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is at number seven down from sixth and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah is down one at eight and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi down one place at nine.

The magazine ranked the 72 people on the list - one for every 100 million people on earth - according to how many people they have power over; the financial resources they control; if they have influence in more than one sphere; and how actively they wield their power to change the world.

In the Commons today, Mr Cameron was accused of going from 'Rambo to Bambi' in just four years.

Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed David Cameron had once spoken of tough action to make sure household bills fell when wholesale prices dropped.

But he claimed the so-called Big Six should now be called the Big Seven because Mr Cameron backed them.

Mr Miliband said: 'In opposition, you said there was a problem in the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and you went on to say, the first thing you've got to do is give the regulator the teeth to order those reductions are made. And that is what we would do.

'Why, when it comes to the energy companies, has it gone from Rambo to Bambi in four short years?'

But Mr Cameron replied: 'Who was it gave us the Big Six? Yes, when Labour first looked at this there were almost 20 companies but because of your stewardship we ended up with six players.

'You talk about a price freeze but down the corridor, they (Labour) have been voting for a price rise - that is right. They voted for a de-carbonisation target that everyone accepts would rise prices.

'If you want a price freeze, why have you just voted for a price rise?'
