Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, whose fortune is estimated at more than $1 billion, has been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry truck

Officials now say there is no evidence the world's most powerful drug baron Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was killed in a February 21 shootout in the Guatemalan jungle.

Earlier reports claimed 'El Chapo' died in a hail of bullets February 21 in a jungle shootout with a rival gang near the Mexican border.

Last week, villagers in the Peten province near the border with Mexico, claimed they spotted a blood-soaked body that resembled the fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader slumped in a car after after a clash between two heavily-armed drugs gangs.

Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla now calls the reports a misunderstanding.

After police and soldiers assessed the area of the shootout, no evidence the kingpin was even there was found.

He called the confusion a result of mistaken eyewitness accounts and apologized for the earlier reports.

'I apologize if where was a misunderstanding. It was a mix-up,' Bonilla told Guatemalan radio station Emisores Unidos. 'We were referring to information generated from the area that there was possibly a crime scene with a dead person resembling El Chapo.'

'As of now, we have no verification,' he said.

Misunderstanding? Villagers in the Peten province of Guatemala near the border with Mexico claimed they found a body resembling El Chapo but officials have now called it all a 'misunderstanding'

Public Enemy Number One: Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's Public Enemy Number One, a year after the US Treasury Department named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before

He is the top dog in Mexico's bloody drug war, presiding over a $1 billion drug empire and accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed 38,000 people.

And in 2011, aside from a personal fortune to rival Bill Gates and Warren 
Buffet, Joaquin Guzman Loera was officially named as the 
world's most wanted man.

Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex break out that reportedly cost him £2.5million.

Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' - meaning 'Shorty' - because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drug cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth.

He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the United States.

He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen 
assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a 
bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of 
non-aggression that had previously existed. 

As tit for tat 
fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in
2006 marking the start of a conflict that has so far claimed 
38,000 lives.

Now
El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's 
government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his 
country amid claims that such drug lords are 
really the ones in charge.

Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas 
first told Guatevision Television that two drug gangs had clashed in 
Peten, an area that has seen an increase in drug violence and that at 
least two men had died in the shootout.

Later, Cuevas told Mexico's Televisa 
network that authorities hadn't yet found a body or the scene where 
reports said a shootout took place.

He never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be Guzman.

But Interior Department spokeswoman 
Carla Herrera told The Associated Press that one of the victims 
physically resembled the drug lord.

She said officials had asked the 
Mexican government to send Guzman's fingerprints to compare them to the 
man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators.

Even then, Bonilla told the AP that it was residents of the town of San Francisco who had told officials of a gun battle and reported that one of the people killed looked like Guzman.

Peten province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the Zetas drug gang, a top rival for Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel.

Guzman, who has been in hiding since escaping from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001, is one of the world's most dangerous and most wanted fugitives.

El Chapo's, fortune is estimated at more than $1 billion, and he's been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican 
prison in a laundry truck. There has been a $7million bounty on his head ever since.

Last year, the US Treasury Department 
named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before 
Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's 
Public Enemy Number One - the first time the infamous soubriquet has 
been rolled out since Al Capone in the 1920s.

Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel 
has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building 
international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific.

And earlier this month, Guzman formally received the title of Chicago's Public Enemy No. in both the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's first use since Prohibition.

The
Public Enemy No. 1 label was created for mobster Al Capone. But the DEA
said Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman is more menacing than the Chicago 
gangster was.
