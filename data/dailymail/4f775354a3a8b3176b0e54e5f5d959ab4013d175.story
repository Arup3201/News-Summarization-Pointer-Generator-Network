A medical student has been hailed a hero after saving the life of a fellow passenger on an airliner at 36,000ft.

Craig MacLean, 22, was on a KLM flight to Abu Dhabi when stewards appealed for a doctor after a man suffered a cardiac arrest.

Although he told staff he was not yet fully qualified to treat patients, Mr MacLean was ushered towards the unconscious passenger.

Despite his inexperience, the Dundee University student started trying to revive the man, then called for the defibrillator kit carried on board to restart the man’s heart.

The flight was diverted to Ankara, in Turkey, where it was struck by lightning as it made an emergency landing. However, the man was safely handed to medical crews.

Mr MacLean, who jetted back to Scotland yesterday from Abu Dhabi, then used the plane’s public address system to let passengers know what had happened.

He said that after answering the appeal for help he told a steward: ‘I’m just a student. Before I could finish, she said, “Come with me”.

‘There was a man in his 50s with vomit coming from his nose and mouth who was unconscious.

‘He was completely unresponsive, so I called for help and we got him on to the floor in the aisle – he was a big man.

‘I assessed him and discovered he was not breathing and had no pulse. A major alarm bell goes off – this is a cardiac arrest. I need to act now, and quickly, or this man will die. I started CPR, called for the defibrillator and asked for an immediate emergency landing.

‘I continued CPR and they brought me medical equipment, at which time a Dutch nurse came to take over CPR.

'I was then able to apply the pads and shock the man. I got his heart beating properly again and he started breathing.’

Mr MacLean, who is from Glasgow and was attending a conference on the health problems caused by tobacco, said that, following the handover of his patient, ‘the last update I got was on landing, at which I was relieved to hear he was alive’.

The Dundee University student started trying to revive the man, then called for the defibrillator kit carried on board to restart the man’s heart. Mr MacLean later took to Twitter to tell his followers about the heroic act

Mr MacLean later tweeted: ‘Not every day you have to ask for an emergency landing and get ROSC [return of spontaneous circulation] at 36,000ft.’

SNP Glasgow Cathcart MSP James Dornan, who knows Mr MacLean, lodged a motion at Holyrood marking his intervention, saying he is a ‘credit to his family, to his tutors who have clearly taught him very well and to Scotland'.

He added: ‘Craig may say that he was just being professional – but it is clear he is a hero.’
