Accused: Peter Roebuck arriving at court for his trial in 2001. The former Somerset captain plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match

The ongoing investigation into the death of Cricketer turned commentator Peter Roebuck, 55, will see police quiz 16 male students who lived at his home in South Africa.

Mr Roebuck had been accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old male Zimbabwean student before he killed himself last weekend.

The alleged victim, Ital Gondo laid a charge of indecent assault against the former Somerset captain after claiming he had been 'groomed' through Facebook.

Officers will now talk to 16 young men - aged 18 to 26 - whose education was being paid for by the sportsman and who lived at his eight-bedroom house in Pietermaritzburg, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.

The men are mostly Zimbabwean and many came from a home for abandoned boys in the country's capital of Harare.

According to the Sunday Times, Tatenda Dennis Chadya, who was one of the first to be sponsored by Mr Roebuck said he thought of them as sons.

He told the newspaper: 'These allegations have come as a complete shock to us all.

'Peter wanted us to be the best that we can and he was inspiration to us all.'

Further investigation: Police are set to question 16 young men who lived with Mr Roebuck at his South African home

Now the men are hoping that a new sponsor will help them to finish their education.

Mr Roebuck
was questioned at around 9pm last Saturday evening by a detective and 
an officer the sexual crimes unit in his room at the Southern Sun hotel
in Cape Town.

Minutes later, with the uniformed 
officer still in the room, Mr Roebuck plunged 70ft to his death, hitting
an awning as he fell. Paramedics were called to the hotel, a short walk
from the Newlands cricket ground, and Mr Roebuck was pronounced dead at
the scene.

Old enemies: Ian Botham, left, and Roebuck, right, in 1987. When Roebuck backed a Somerset club committee decision not to renew the contracts of West Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for Roebuck

Police seized items from his hotel room, including a laptop computer.

Mr Roebuck had spent part of his last day alive with members of the Australian cricket team, who had lost their first Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday.

He regularly toured with the team as a distinguished writer and broadcaster for the Australian media, following a career in county cricket during which he played 335 first-class matches. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1988.

Police spokesman Captain Frederick 
Van Wyk confirmed Mr Roebuck’s death was being treated as suicide, but 
would not give details about the sexual assault allegations.

In his long playing record, one 
incident stood out – a spectacular clash with Sir Ian Botham when he 
replaced him as Somerset captain in 1985.

He divided his time between homes in 
Bondi Beach, Australia, and the South African town of Pietermaritzburg, 
where he was helping a group of underprivileged boys through school and 
university.

Mr Roebuck, who was unmarried, was at
the centre of controversy in 2001 when he received a suspended jail 
sentence for common assault after beating three teenage cricketers 
across their bare buttocks with a cane.

The South African boys had been invited to stay at his former home in Taunton, Somerset, for coaching in the late 1990s.
