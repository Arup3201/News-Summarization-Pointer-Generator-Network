A 24-year-old high school teacher has confessed to performing sex acts with multiple students, one as young as 15 years old, inside her locked classroom, as well as sending them sexualized pictures of herself.

Meredith Powell, of Tacoma, Washington, allegedly is accused of sending three male students inappropriate pictures of herself in a bathtub, as well as engaging in sex acts with two of the students, police said.

Powell, a math teacher at Lincoln High School, pleaded not guilty on Friday to two counts of third-degree child rape and one count of communication with a minor for immoral purposes for alleged inappropriate conduct with three students, according to The News Tribune.

Meredith Powell is accused of sending naked photographs of herself in the bathtub, sending sexual text messages and exchanging furtive kisses exchanged during a Lincoln High School assembly. She also allegedly engaged in oral sex in her classroom

Tacoma police began investigating this week after learning that Powell wrote a letter to one of the boy’s girlfriends apologizing for 'promiscuous' and 'unprofessional' drunken text messages she exchanged with one of the boys.

Powell was arrested on Thursday and placed on unpaid leave.

Police said Powell began a relationship with the three students - who are between the ages of 15 and sixteen - in January.

Powell allegedly told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated and sent a text to the students, saying they were 'hot', following back-and-forth communication.

Powell said she apologized to the students the next morning, and also sent a letter to one of the defendant’s girlfriends in an attempt to explain what happened.

After interviewing the victims, who said they had sexual contact with Powell behind a lock door in her classroom, police again interviewed Powell.

She allegedly admitted to engaging in oral sex with one of the students and other sex acts with another at different times in late January.

She also sent at least one of the victims a Snapchat photo of her in the bathtub.

She told police she knew her actions were wrong, and that she would apologize to the student’s parents if she could.

Powell was hired by the Tacoma Public School district in September 2012.

One student, Tabitha Maxine, wrote on the page that Powell was an excellent teacher and the allegations were 'bologna'.

'Miss Powell is such a caring and amazing math teacher, she has so much patience with those that are struggling to learn and she brings so much life and energy into her classroom with her every day,' she wrote.

'I'm absolutely appalled at the audacity of the student who accused her of such a horrible crime.'
