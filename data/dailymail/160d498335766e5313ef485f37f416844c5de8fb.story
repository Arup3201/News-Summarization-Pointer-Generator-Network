A new curry sauce containing a third of the calories, saturated fat and salt, than similar Indian cooking pastes on sale, claims to be the healthiest on the market. 

The tikka masala in a jar has even been given a stamp of approval by health experts at Heart Research UK.

Per 100g, Mum's Masala has just 100 calories, 0.5 grams of saturated fat and 0.7 grams of salt.

Tikka masala is usually one of the most fattening of curries because it contains lots of butter and cream

Similar Indian sauces for sale can have three times as many calories, salt and sugar per 100 grams and significantly more health-damaging saturated fat.

Tikka masala is usually one of the most fattening of curries because it contains so much butter and cream.

Following his father's death from a heart attack, creator Narinder Gill was determined to develop a healthy version of the sauce his mother used to make in the family home every day.

He claims his product will revolutionise Indian cooking.

Mr Gill, 50, of Coventry, West Midlands, said: 'When my mum came to England she had brought the spices with her as curry was something very new here.

Narinder Gill developed the healthy sauce

'I remember her grinding all the different spices in a pestle and mortar to make a masala when I was a child. 

'My mother-in-law still grinds all the spices together. 

'The recipes she used were handed down from their mothers, grandmothers and great grandmothers.'

'After doing my homework to see what was available on the market, I realised there was a gap for a healthy Indian option so I set to work with a chef to develop a unique recipe that would help towards fighting heart disease.

'Our curry base takes people back to the traditional way of making curries, with fresh ingredients and without lots of butter.

'We are extremely fortunate to have Heart Research UK supporting us. 

'I know my father would be very proud too.'

TV chef and nutritionist Sally Bee, who has helped develop the product, said: 'I believe nutrition is the key to health and this is truly the first healthy curry I have ever seen.'

A spokesman for Heart Research UK said: 'We are so impressed by the simplicity, quality and nutritional value of the range that we wanted to get behind it to educate the nation how to eat healthy, authentic curries.

'This is a major breakthrough in Indian cuisine as for the first time previously fat-laden dishes can be enjoyed without the risk to the heart and your health.'

The £2.29 sauce, serving up to five people, is on sale exclusively in supermarket chain Morrisons.
