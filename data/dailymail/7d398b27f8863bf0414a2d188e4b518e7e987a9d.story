A pensioner whose wife died from cancer after he booked £1,200 flights for them to go on holiday was refused a refund by EasyJet - until they performed a 'U-turn'.

Thomas Douglas-Woods, 85, booked two trips to Malta with his wife Margaret months before she died of pancreatic cancer.

The couple, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, were due to go on the holidays in June and September last year.

Anger: Thomas Douglas-Woods, 85, was 'refused' a refund by EasyJet after he was unable to fly on holiday with his wife because she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He is seen here holding her death certificate

However, after Mr Douglas-Woods had paid for the flights his wife was declared too sick to travel and she died aged 81 before their second trip.

The pensioner wrote to EasyJet but they turned down his request for a refund and told him to contact his insurer instead.

It was only last month after his wife had died that they finally gave him is money back in full.

The two missed holidays cost Mr Douglas-Woods £1,200 but the airline was initially not interested in refunding Mr Douglas-Woods.

After cancelling the first trip due to his wife's illness, Mr Douglas-Woods told the Daily Star: 'I think it's absolutely disgusting. This is a genuine case, it's not someone who's broken down on the way to the airport.

'When somebody says: "My wife is dying, I can't go," they should take notice.

When approached today, he added: 'It's all resolved now. I don't want any more problems from EasyJet, I've had so many problems up to this point and it's finally all over.

'Its sorted and I just want to put the whole thing behind me now.'

A spokesman for EasyJet confirmed that they have now given Mr Douglas-Woods a full refund for the missed flights.

'Mr Woods contacted us last week to let us know his wife had died and that is why he did not fly with us in September,' he said.

'As soon as we were notified we processed a refund for him. We do sympathise with our customers and do all we can to make the process as easy as possible at an already difficult time.'
