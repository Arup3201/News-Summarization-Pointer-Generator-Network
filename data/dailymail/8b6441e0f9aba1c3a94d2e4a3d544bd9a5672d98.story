There are sighs of relief on both sides of the Atlantic at the announcement that Kell Brook has signed the contract to challenge Shawn Porter for the world welterweight title.

More than a month after the initial announcement of the fight, Brook’s Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has finally been able to take to Twitter to confirm the British end of the deal.

Hearn, perhaps with an element of tongue in cheek, also remarked that Porter will be stripped of his IBF belt if he does not now sign to meet his mandatory challenger from Sheffield.

Up for it: Kell Brook has a signed a deal to fight Shawn Porter for the IBF welterweight title on August 9

The reaction from Kenny Porter, the champion’s trainer and father, is one of guarded optimism.

During the delay Porter Snr had questioned Brook’s willingness to go through with fighting his big-punching son. He cited Brook withdrawing twice from scheduled world title bouts against Devon Alexander, from whom Porter won the IBF title in one of Brook’s injury enforced absences.

Alexander had also pulled out of one championship meeting with Brook when injured himself.

The American camp still seems concerned whether Brook will show up at the Brooklyn Centre in New York on the proposed date of August 9.

However, with the fight barely six weeks away Porter is already deep into training.

But so is Brook and it is  inconceivable that at the age of 28 and with 32 wins on his unbeaten record he will miss out again on a world title shot.

This is his big chance. He also knows that if he is ever to lure Amir Khan into a big-money domestic fight he needs to bring a world title to the negotiating table.

Khan has stirred the pot by saying: ‘I keep hearing from some close to Kell that he is not sure if he is ready for Porter.’

But Brook says: ‘I know this will be a tough fight but while Porter is strong I believe I have the better skills.’

Porter’s father retorts: ‘Shawn is bigger, stronger and faster and we’re going to find out how much punishment Brook can take.’

After de-throning Alexander, Porter was given a one-fight exemption from his mandatory obligation to Brook and stopped Paulie Malignaggi in four rounds.

His promoters, Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy company, do have other big fights in the pipe-line for Porter but the IBF are insisting that he goes through with defending against Brook.

It does now look as if the fight will happen, with Porter sounding confident. Or are he and his father relying on Brook pulling out?
