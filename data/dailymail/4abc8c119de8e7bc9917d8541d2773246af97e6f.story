A Texas fitness instructor wanted over the repeated sexual assault of a 13-year-old American girl has been arrested by police in Thailand.

U.S. officials had suspicions that Forrest Wayne, 44, was in Thailand and notified local authorities.

The trainer was wanted over charges of repeated aggravated sexual assault of a child at a west Houston hotel, where he met the 13-year-old for alleged sexual relations over the four months from July to October.

According to KHOU, Wayne was shopping in a Thai health food store when an employee became suspicious, using his information to do an internet search and finding news stories about the allegations.
