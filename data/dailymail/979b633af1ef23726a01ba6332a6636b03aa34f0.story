Italians are known for their generous portions at dinnertime but one family restaurant has taken it to a whole other level.

La Famiglia Giorgio's Ristorante, an Italian restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts, has seen more than half a million people take on its Lasagne Challenge over the last 23 years - that averages out at more than 60 people a day - but only 15 have finished the 7,000 calorie feast.

The 6lb feast has only been finished by 15 people in 23 years, out of more than 500,000 attempts

Anyone who manages to complete the challenge at La Famiglia Girgio's Ristorante, left, does not have to pay the $40.90 price tag for the 6lb lasagna and gets an 'I ate the plate!' t-shirt, right, as a reward

1lb Ricotta cheese - 800 calories1lb Romano cheese - 1800 calories1lb Mozzarella cheese - 1300 calories1lb Bolognese - 1500 calories2lb Pasta sheets - 1600 calories

The rules are simple, customers attempt to eat a 6lb serving of the traditional favourite and, if they manage to clear the plate, they get the meal for free and a t-shirt that read 'I ate the plate!'. If they fail, as almost everyone does, they have to fork out $40.90 (Â£24) for their trouble.

The last successful attempt was more than a year ago.

Albert Giorgio, 48, the restaurant's general manager and the man behind the challenge, said: 'I put the dish on the menu because it's hilarious watching people fail.

'Also
 lasagne is a classic, staple meal for Italian-Americans as well as 
across the world. So it seemed like the perfect challenge to offer.

'All kinds of men and women have attempted the challenge.

'And customers go crazy trying to complete it. People jump around trying to work up an appetite midway through the meal.

'Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of people throw-up attempting to do it too!'

The monstrous meal contains 1lb or Ricotta cheese, 1lb of Romano cheese, 1lb of Mozzarella cheese, 1lb of Bolognese sauce (containing beef, veal and pork), and 2lb of pasta.
