The price of olive oil is expected to soar because of a shortage of olives due to the warm spring weather

The price of olive oil is set to rise because of a period of intensely hot weather in Spain, which affected the harvest. 

Growers have said 2014 was the worst year for olives in 15 years and a bottle of olive oil could now prove more costly than a bottle of expensive wine.  

A combination of the poor harvest, as well as large flocks of starlings and insects that eat olives, has created a shortfall of olives and has led experts to dub it a 'black year.' 

'This is the worst year in memory,' Pietro Sandali, head of the Italian olive growers consortium, Unaprol, told the Observer.

Harvests are down between 40 and 50 per cent on last year in some of the key olive growing regions of Italy, Morocco and Tunisia. 

In Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean, an exceptionally warm May and June has affected the blooming of trees and the subsequent harvest. 

During this time moisture is vital to ensure olives grow. 

The problem was exacerbated in Spain where trees were already under stress after a higher than average harvest last year.  

The International Olive Council (IOC) said production will hit its lowest level in 15 years and supply was down by almost a third. 

Prices from producers have increased by more than 100 per cent since the same period last year. 

Olive trees have also been hit by insects and bacterial blight which can wipe out strong crops. 

The olive fruit fly or Bactrocera oleae, lays its eggs in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit.

Olive trees have been affected by the unseasonably warm weather in May and June as well as insects 

In December commodity analysts Mintec said olive oil prices had increased by 30 per cent in just one month. 

Spain is the largest producer of olive oil while Italy is the largest exporter.
