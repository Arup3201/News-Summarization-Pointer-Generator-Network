English referee Howard Webb found himself at the centre of a bitter storm between Brazil and Chile last night ahead of taking charge of the first knockout game of the tournament in Belo Horizonte.

Webb, who came in for some criticism in the wake of the last World Cup final, faced further questions from the Chileans, who fear he may not be strong enough not to favour the host nation. Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez said: ‘What worries me most about this game is the referee.’

The Chile FA president is also reported to have expressed concern that Webb would buckle under the considerable pressure at the Estadio Mineirao.

Unimpressed: But Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari dismissed talk as being disrespectful towards Brazil

That sparked an angry reaction at Brazil’s press conference, with their federation’s director of communications, Rodrigo Paiva, taking to the stage to deliver a speech.

When Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari was told by a Chilean journalist that Chile’s ‘president and players are worried’, a ranting Paiva intervened. 

‘We’ll talk about it only once,’ he said as Scolari and Brazil captain Thiago Silva looked on. ‘It’s something that’s immature. This kind of pressure is ridiculous.

‘Talking about this is not a lack of respect to FIFA or the referee or the people who work here with 100 years of winning history. It’s a lack of respect to the Brazil people.

‘We don’t need a referee to win a match, it’s insulting. That’s all the CBF will say on the matter.’

It did nothing to ease the tension before what is a huge game for Brazil. Scolari spoke of ‘anxiety and nerves’. Silva said all the players were suffering under a burden of expectation playing a World Cup here in Brazil.

He said it was only because of Scolari — their rock as well as their coach — that they were ready for what promises to be a fascinating encounter with the much-fancied Chile.

‘It’s impossible to shut off what this means,’ said the Paris Saint-Germain defender. ‘But this guy beside me is very special for us, even at a difficult moment, family issues, he’s always there for us. In fact I need to stop talking because I’m a big cry baby and it might happen here.’
