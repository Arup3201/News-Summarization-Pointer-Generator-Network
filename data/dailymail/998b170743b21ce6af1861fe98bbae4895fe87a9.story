The Brazilian student who sold her virginity for a staggering $780,000 after she put it up for auction online, is now claiming she is a victim who was exploited into selling her body.

Catarina Migliorini, 21, says she is yet to see a single cent after selling her virginity in October last year to a Japanese man called 'Natsu' in an online auction organized by filmmaker Justin Sisely.

'I felt I was a victim ... I was misled by Mr. Justin Sisely,' Miss Migliorini, who says she is still a virgin, told the Huffington Post. 'I believe he is trying to defraud me and others.'

Virgin or victim? Brazilian student Catarina Migliorini sold her virginity for $780,000 after she put it up for auction online; but she is now claiming she is a victim who was exploited into selling her body

Natsu, 53, a Japanese millioniaire fended
 off strong competition from American bidders Jack Miller and Jack 
Right, and Indian big-spender Rudra Chatterjee, to secure a date with the physical education student - who 
said she would use the cash to build homes for poverty-stricken families.

The auction was supposedly part of an Australian documentary entitled Virgins Wanted, in which Mr Sisley would explore the lives of Miss Migliorini and Alex Stepanov, a male who auctioned his virginity for $3,000.

Miss Migliorini's move sparked outrage across the globe, with many claiming she was little more than a prostitute.

But she told Folha 
newspaper at the time: 'I saw this as a business. I have the opportunity to travel, to be part of a movie and get a bonus with it.

'If you only do it once in your life 
then you are not a prostitute, just like if you take one amazing 
photograph it does not automatically make you a photographer.

'The
 auction is just business, I'm a romantic girl at heart and believe in 
love. But this will make a big difference to my area.'

But when Miss Migliorini went to meet her winning bidder, Natsu, in a Sydney restaurant, she claims that he didn't match the description Mr Sisely had given her, and insists the pair did not have sex. 

She also claims Mr Sisely did not cover her traveling expenses, or give her the $780,000 paid by Natsu; and she now believes that 'Natsu' doesn't exist, and that the auction was simply a ploy to gain media coverage for the documentary.

Tricked? The physical education student claims she has not received the money promised to her by filmmaker Justin Sisely, and believes the auction was simply a publicity stunt for Australian documentary, Virgins Wanted

'I
 agreed to go along with [the auction], because Justin said it would be 
the best way to draw attention from the media about the project,' she said.

Mr Sisely, who first announced the documentary in May 2010 and said it would conclude with both of the virgins having sex, denies her claims.

'We have the footage to prove otherwise,' he explained.

In a bid to avoid prostitution laws, Miss Migliorini was to be 
'delivered' to her buyer on board a plane between Australia and the U.S.
 - being interviewed before and after the sexual act.

The intercourse itself would not be filmed, said Mr Sisely,
 and Natsu would retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture 
appearing in the media.

In exchange for her participation, Miss Migliorini said she was promised 20per cent of documentary sales and all money from the winning auction bid of $780,000. Neither has materialized, she claims.

Miss Migliorini previously said she wanted to give 90per cent of the final auction sale price to a non-governmental organization constructing modern houses in her southern home state of Santa Catarina.

She signed up to the project three years ago when she saw an advert by Thomas Williams Productions looking for a virgin to film.
