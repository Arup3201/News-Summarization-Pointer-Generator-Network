Facebook has rolled out a new system to try and identify and help users having suicidal thoughts.

It allows concerned friends  to report content for review. 

After reviewing a report and confirming that it may indicate suicidal feelings in a user, Facebook will send that user notifications stating that a friend has attempted to help and offering access to suicide prevention resources.

The San Francisco social network's new system allows concerned friends to to report content for review, and Facebook can then offer the user more help.

The tools build on a reporting feature implemented in 2011, which passed details to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the US, and the Samaritans in the UK.  

'Keeping you safe is our most important responsibility on Facebook,' said Rob Boyle of Facebook. 

'Today, at our fifth Compassion Research Day, we announced updated tools that provide more resources, advice and support to people who may be struggling with suicidal thoughts and their concerned friends and family members.'

The firm said it had worked with mental health organizations Forefront, Now Matters Now, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Save.org and others on the updates, and consulted with people who had lived experience with self-injury or suicide. 

'One of the first things these organizations discussed with us was how much connecting with people who care can help those in distress. 

'If someone on Facebook sees a direct threat of suicide, we ask that they contact their local emergency services immediately.

'We also ask them to report any troubling content to us.' 

Facebook has set up teams working around the world, 24/7, who review any report that comes in.

They prioritize the most serious reports, like self-injury, and send help and resources to those in distress.

The firm said it had worked with mental health organizations Forefront, Now Matters Now, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Save.org and others on the updates, and consulted with people who had lived experience with self-injury or suicide.

For those who may need help we have significantly expanded the support and resources that are available to them the next time they log on to Facebook after we review a report of something they’ve posted. 

Besides encouraging them to connect with a mental health expert at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, we now also give them the option of reaching out to a friend, and provide tips and advice on how they can work through these feelings. 

All of these resources were created in conjunction with our clinical and academic partners.

We’re also providing new resources and support to the person who flagged the troubling post, including options for them to call or message their distressed friend letting them know they care, or reaching out to another friend or a trained professional at a suicide hotline for support.
