BORUSSIA DORTMUND 1-1 ANDERLECHT 

Dortmund earned some relief from their domestic woes on Tuesday as they qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League as group winners - but their 1-1 draw against Anderlecht told of a side still down on confidence and form.

Ciro Immobile's splendid 58th-minute goal had looked as if it would be enough to give the already qualified Germans, who had only climbed off the foot of the Bundesliga at the weekend, a victorious finale in Group D.

Yet Anderlecht, lively and with nothing to lose as they had already been eliminated, were finally rewarded for the threat they had offered at a nervous Westfalenstadion all evening when Serbian Aleksandar Mitrovic headed a thumping 84th-minute equaliser.

It left Dortmund facing a nervous few last minutes, knowing that with Arsenal winning 4-1 at Galatasaray, another goal from the Belgians would deprive them of the advantage of finishing in top spot, but they were well worth their morale-boosting win.

OLYMPIACOS 4-2 MALMO 

Greek champions Olympiacos had to settle for a Europa League place despite a 4-2 win over Malmo in their final Champions League Group A match.

Olympiacos finished third, a point behind Juventus who drew 0-0 with already-qualified group leaders Atletico Madrid to claim second apot and a place in the last 16.

Kostas Mitroglou and substitute Ibrahim Afellay struck in the last three minutes for Olympiacos to down the Swedes, who had twice drawn level at the Georgios Karaiskakis stadium.

The hosts had scored through David Fuster's opener and Alejandro DomÃnguez's stunning volley, either side of Simon Kroon's goal for the visitors, before Malmo's Rosenberg made it 2-2 in the 81st minute before the late push from Olympiacos.

MONACO 2-0 ZENIT ST PETERSBURG 

Aymen Abdennour and Fabinho's second-half goals helped Monaco beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 at home and send the principality side into the last 16 of the Champions League.

Centre back Abdennour headed home in the 64th minute and Fabinho sealed victory with a low shot one minute from time as Monaco clinched top spot in Group C with 11 points from six games, although they managed a miserly four goals.

Only Villareal in the 2005-06 season and AS Roma in 2002-03 qualified from the initial group phase scoring less goals, both teams netting only three.

BENFICA 0-0 BAYER LEVERKUSEN 

Bayer Leverkusen drew 0-0 at Benfica to advance in the competition but the Bundesliga side surrendered top spot in Group C to Monaco.

The German club were already guaranteed a place in the knockout round, but needed a win in Lisbon to secure top spot and the prospect of facing a runner-up from another group as its next opponent. 

With five points from its six matches and bottom place in the group, Benfica recorded its worst ever Champions League group campaign.
