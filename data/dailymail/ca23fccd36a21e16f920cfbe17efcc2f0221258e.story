A powerful memorial aimed at the killers of a 22-year-old man who was stabbed after refusing to give up his skateboard has appeared in Echo Park, Los Angeles, near the scene of the crime.

Carlos Arellano was walking with his girlfriend on Sunset Boulevard when he was attacked by three people.

The couple were near Laveta Terrace when one of the suspects punched him in the jaw. Mr Arellano swung his skateboard in self-defence before being stabbed in the stomach and collapsing to the ground as his girlfriend screamed.

'Here's your f****** skateboard': The scathing message written to Carlos Arellano's killers in Echo Park

A witness, who recognised the couple as regulars at his store, told The Eastsider: 'He got shanked and fell to the floor.' 

Mr Arellano was taken to hospital, but died from his injuries.

A skateboard has been taped to a lamp post near to where the attack took place as a memorial to Mr Arellano, with a massage attached that also attacks his killers.

It reads: 'Did they kill him for a skateboard? Or just for fun? Here's your f***ing skateboard. I looked at a dying man in the face last night. Is this the first time you've killed? Will you brag at school? Did you get a merit badge?'

Mr Arellano's sister Jessica told CBS Los Angeles: 'It’s hard seeing my brother die over someone who just wanted a skateboard. That they wanted his skateboard [that badly] is ridiculous. If anyone knows something, please come forward.'

Los Angeles Police Officer Nuria Vanegas  said the attack took place at about 11.30pm last Friday, in the 1500 block of West Sunset Boulevard.

After stabbing Mr Arellano, the suspects fled north on Echo Park Avenue, and remain at large. 

Gang detectives are investigating the incident, though there is currently no clear evidence that links it to gang activity.

Echo Park was extremely busy throughout the weekend because of the Echo Park Rising music festival.

Friends and family gathered in Echo Park on Saturday night to remember Mr Arellano.
