A retired police inspector has helped  experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair.

Stargazer Roy Jackson, 71, began his hobby after retiring 15 years ago when he became fed up of daytime television.

Mr Jackson, of Birtley, Gateshead, enrolled on a computer course at Gateshead College and now uses his technology skills to analyse the stars.

His years of seaching the skies have paid off after he discovered the planet - now named by astronomers as 'PH2 b'.

Mr Jackson said: 'There is nothing worth watching on the television and there's only so much gardening you can do and you have to have other things to fill your time in.

'I like the odd quiz show and Corrie but the rest of the soaps are a bit beyond me - they are just miserable.

'With astronomy you can see things you would never imagine like galaxies and star formations.'

However, rather than park himself at the end of a telescope, Mr Jackson prefers to research in comfort and uses his computer to uncover the mysteries of space  whilst reclining in his armchair.

Mr Jackson volunteered to analyse information for astronomers as part of 'The Planet Hunters' project set up by Oxford and Yale Universities, which asked for citizen scientists to spot patterns in celestial data.

'I don't have a telescope and I don't want one - I can do it all from the computer,' he said.

Stargazer Roy Jackson, 71, from Gateshead, said his wife is still unimpressed after he helped experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair - now named by astronomers as 'PH2 b'

'I don't want to sit outside in the cold when I can sit in the warmth and comfort of my own front room and look at the computer.

'I see things I could never see in the back garden with a telescope.

'The problem is, the astronomers have collected all of this data using satellites but they don't have the time or manpower to analyse it all, so they post their findings on a website and invite the public to highlight anything of interest.'

The discovery of the planet is the first major find for Mr Jackson, who describes it as 'A little bit like winning the lottery.'

Mr Jackson has been credited in a research paper which has been published online by the prestigious Astrophysical Journal, and is only one of a handful  of volunteers to do so.The planet PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away.

However, his wife remains unimpressed.

Mr Jackson said: 'My wife Lilian isn't all that interested in the stars, she just lets me get on with it.

'But she did say I need a new bigger hat for my head swelling!'

Mr Jackson is part of a team of international armchair stargazers who assist scientists analyzing outer space in their spare time.

After joining Durham Constabulary as a PC, Mr Jackson worked his way up to become an inspector. Since retiring after 30 years of service, star gazing has become the pensioners full time occupation and says it is just as thrilling as catching criminals.

Mr Jackson admitted that he sometimes spends more time online than he should.

He said: 'It's a little bit addictive. I look at a bit of data, then I know I should stop but I think 'just one more'.

'You never know what the next one is going to be'

The discovery led researchers to claim moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life.

Astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life-friendly 'habitable zones' of stars.

All are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to Jupiter or Neptune.

James Cameron's Avatar was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought.

While such planets would not themselves be suitable for Earth-like life, they could be circled by moons on which there are forests, oceans and living creatures, researchers now believe.

Pandora, the fictional moon in Avatar, is just such a world.

So far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9% certainty.

The rest still fall into the category of 'candidate' planets while further evidence is collected.

The confirmed planet, known as PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away.

Astronomer Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, a member of the international team behind the discovery, said: 'There's an obsession with finding Earth-like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as PH2 b is far stranger.

'Jupiter has several large water-rich moons. Imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the Earth is.

'If such a planet had Earth-size moons, we'd see not Europa and Callisto but worlds with rivers, lakes and all sorts of habitats: a surprising scenario that might just be common.

'It may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around Jupiter and Neptune-size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system.'

Members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers.

The Planet Hunters project invites 'citizen scientists' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell-tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars.

Follow-up work with the Keck telescope in Hawaii provided the proof that PH2 b is almost certainly a genuine planet.

Planet Hunters lead scientist Professor Debra Fisher, from Yale University in the US, said: 'We are seeing the emergence of a new era in the Planet Hunters project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars.

'Now, the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds.'

Avatar featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like Pandora could be the best place to look for alien life

Before the latest finds, 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones. Also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but "just right" to permit liquid surface water.

Dr Ji Wang, another Planet Hunters scientist from Yale University, said: 'We can speculate that PH2 b might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life.

'I can't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments.

'That could happen any day now.'
