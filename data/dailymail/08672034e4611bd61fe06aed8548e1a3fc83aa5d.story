Olympic gold medal-winning snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington has revealed that she is retiring after being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition.

The 25-year-old athlete, who won gold for the halfpipe at the Olympic Games in Sochi last February, made the announcement on her Instagram page.

'The past few months have been really difficult,' she wrote.

'I've met with many specialists and they all confirmed I have congenital cervical stenosis of my spine, a condition I was born with and never knew I had until a recent fall in Austria led me to get an MRI.

Life changing: Kaitlyn Farrington, pictured in February 2014 with her Olympic gold medal for the halfpipe, has announced she is retiring from snowboarding because she has a degenerative spine condition

'It's taken me these few months to come to terms with my diagnosis and the fact that I must retire from competitive halfpipe snowboarding.

'I am so thankful for my friends, family and sponsors for their support throughout this time. It's been an unbelievable run and I look forward to my next quarter century. Cheers to early retirement.' 

Speaking with ESPN, she revealed that after taking a fall from a jump in Austria in late October, she was unable to feel any part of her body and could not move for two minutes.

'It was hard to comprehend what was happening,' she said.

Eventually the movement came back but, still troubled by a pain on her neck after returning home to Salt Lake City, she went to a spine doctor, who told her she would never snowboard again.

'I wasn't ready to hear it,' she said. 'It was the worst conversation of my life.'  

She met with other specialists, who all repeated the diagnosis, leaving her angry and wishing she hadn't found out. She kept the truth from her loved ones. 

Trouble: U.S. Snowboard team physician Dr. Tom Hackett shows her MRI and points to the kink in her spinal cord that would put her at risk of paralysis if she continued to compete in snowboarding

'I think by lying, I convinced myself it wasn't happening,' she said. 'I couldn't accept it yet.' 

But the day before her 25th birthday, she met with U.S. Snowboard team physician Tom Hackett, who had been her doctor since she was a child, and he told her the same thing: she had been born with a narrowing of her spine in her neck that could leave her unable to walk if she took a fall.

'There is no room to allow for any movement of the spinal cord when the spine flexes and bends, to prevent the cord from getting kinked or pinched,' he told ESPN. 'In Kaitlyn's spine, there is no room for error. It's only by the grace of God that nothing worse happened before this injury.'

If she continued to snowboard and took another fall, she could be paralyzed. 

He said his heart sank when he saw her MRI because: 'I knew it was over.'

Slowly she started breaking the news to loved ones and there were more tears, she said.

Winner: Farrington, pictured competing at Sochi, said at first she refused to accept the diagnosis

Joy: She is pictured center at Sochi last year with bronze medallist, Kelly Clark (left) from the U.S., and silver medallist, Australia's Torah Bright. She said she is grateful she did not learn about the condition earlier

But she is now coming to terms with the diagnosis, and is thankful that she did not learn about it too early - when she would have missed out on a snowboarding career - or too late.

'I can walk. I can still snowboard,' she told ESPN. 'I just have to keep my feet on the ground. I still want to be a professional snowboarder, I just have to figure out what that means.'

Farrington unexpectedly won gold in Sochi last February, beating tough competition from the previous three Olympic champions, Torah Bright, Kelly Clark and Hannah Teter.

'The next quarter of my life is going to be extremely different from the first. I have to figure out how to make it just as great.'
