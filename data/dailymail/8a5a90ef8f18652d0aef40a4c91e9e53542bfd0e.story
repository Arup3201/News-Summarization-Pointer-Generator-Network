Chelsea are assessing Ramires after the midfielder picked up a groin injury.

The Brazil international is a doubt for Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash against Bolton and will be monitored ahead of the weekend clash versus Aston Villa.

Blues assistant manager Steve Holland has confirmed Jose Mourinho will make wholesale changes from the side that started against Manchester City on Sunday.

Loic Remy is is in line for his first start for the Blues since sealing a summer move to the west London outfit

Petr Cech is set for his first start of the season, while Loic Remy could make his full debut against Bolton.

'It is an opportunity to rotate the squad. We will do that for sure. In terms of who definitely is and who definitely isn't play at the moment that's unclear,' said Holland.

'There will be some changes tomorrow and it will be an opportunity for some players to stake a claim.

'I don't think he's tried to specify which goalkeeper will play in which competition. It will be just judged on merit on a week-to-week basis.

'We're very lucky to have two, three, high-level players to choose from. Whatever choice is made we have total confidence in our goalkeepers.'
