Television and film scenes that show adultery, one-night stands or feature pornographic content have been banned in China.

The country's media and television regulator has issued a letter to content providers outlining that all content related to sexual abuse, one-night stands, polyamorous relationships and extra-marital affairs must be deleted from video streaming websites.

The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television demanded that any program with pornographic content must be removed, reported Sina.

It also said that content depict rape, masturbation, prostitution and necrophilia must also be cut. 

Websites must remove everything, including headlines and pictures, that refer to sex and nudity - as well as plots that show violent murder, suicide, kidnapping, drug abuse, gambling or anything supernatural. 

The move has sparked fears that the regulation means audiences in China will have very few television dramas or films to watch.   

Tan Tian, a professor a Jinan University, told the Global Times: 'Media regulators used to have loose regulations on [these] programs, so that the public is often exposed to contents related to sex, violence and murder.'

He added the watchdog should not be extreme in its regulations as it could prevent programs being made in the future. 

The move is part of the Chinese government's campaign against pornography and lewd content called 'Cleaning the Web 2014'. 

In April this year, more than 100 websites have been shut down, according to the State Internet Information Office.

Last month, Chinese authorities ordered television stations, cinemas, online entertainment sites and other outlets not to show works by entertainers found to have been involved in vice crimes such as using drugs or visiting prostitutes.

A directive cited directors, playwrights and actors whose misdeeds included using drugs or hiring prostitutes had corrupted society's moral standards.  

It added the rules are aimed at cleansing screens, airwaves and cyberspace to ensure that core socialist values are promoted. 

Although the industry's regulating agency — the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television — has not released the internal document or officially acknowledged it, the Communist Party-run People's Daily confirmed the ban by quoting unnamed insiders in an online report. 

The English-language China Daily also reported the ban, as did the news portal Sina, which published the content of the directive issued on September 28.
