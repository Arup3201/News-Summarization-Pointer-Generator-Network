Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has criticised sports stars David Beckham and Gary Lineker for promoting junk food.

The television presenter, who forced the Government to introduce nutrition rules in schools after highlighting the unhealthy meals served to pupils, has added his name to a letter which condemns the use of athletes in commercials.

Oliver and other signatories, including Dr Hilary Cass, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), say the practice sends the wrong message to children.

The letter, published in the Times, reads: 'On the eve of the London Olympics we, a group with a vested interest in improving the health and wellbeing of young people, express our grave concern about this trend.

'We believe it is wrong for athletes to encourage the excessive consumption of such items, which are fuelling poor health and obesity.

'David Beckham is a great sportsman, yet he has endorsed Pepsi.

'What about the impact of Gary Lineker’s association with Walkers crisps? Or the partnership between Mars and the FA?'

The letter claims that food companies
are aware their products have 'little redeeming nutritional qualities' 
but can trigger a 'so-called "halo" effect' by associating them with 
sport.

It warns that diet-related diseases are reaching global epidemic proportions.

The
letter continues: 'With one in three children in Britain overweight or 
obese by the age of nine, we have a public health crisis that requires 
urgent intervention.'

It
ends: 'We would ask athletes to be very conscious of the effect their 
endorsements may have on the future lives of youngsters.

'Obesity does not just carry physical consequences but serious social and emotional ones as well.'

Other
signatories to the letter are RCPCH past president Professor Terence 
Stephenson, National Association of Head Teachers president Steve 
Iredale, Children’s Food Campaign director Charlie Powell and London 
cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra.

Dr
Malhotra, who has called for a ban on junk food sponsorship of the 
Olympics, said: 'It is totally perverse that some of the main sponsors 
of the greatest sporting spectacle in the world are McDonald’s and 
Coca-Cola.

'One
vital step in reducing the consumption of obesogenic products is to end
the association of sporting role models with junk food.

'The very lucrative financial gain for these athletes is sadly at the expense of our children’s health and we should not allow this to continue.'

Dr Cass said: 'We shouldn’t underestimate the fascination that many children and young people have with celebrities, whether that’s teenage girls skipping meals to look like the latest airbrushed magazine model or boys wanting the same brand boot as their footballing idol.

'Sporting role models in particular can send a powerful message to children when it comes to their health and fitness.

'Instead of glamorising junk food, they should be using their influence to inspire children and young people to become tomorrow’s top athletes by eating well and leading active lifestyles.

Critical: TV chef Jamie Oliver has signed a letter criticising the use of athletes to promote foods with 'little redeeming nutritional qualities'

'With celebrity status comes responsibility. So rather than helping to fuel this nation’s growing obesity crisis, these stars can play a key role in helping stem it.'

Mr Iredale said: 'Like many colleagues in the teaching profession and beyond I continue to be frustrated by the direct link made by large numbers of young people between the sports men and women idolised by so many and the promotion of unhealthy food and drink.

'This sends entirely the wrong message to a generation who are often influenced by the advertising of these products by their heroes.

'I would ask those involved to reflect carefully on the potential consequences of their actions and instead work together to help to improve the health and life chances of those who are so vulnerable.'
