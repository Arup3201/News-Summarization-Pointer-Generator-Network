Germany is poised for its first deployment of troops in Ukraine since the Nazi invasion of then Soviet territory in 1941 which led to millions of deaths.

An historic move to send 200 peacekeepers – including 50 paratroopers – was under active consideration last night.

It comes as the crumbling ceasefire between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government was under its strongest pressure since coming into effect a month ago.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has led European moves to secure peace in Ukraine, but until now Berlin has been reluctant to deploy even peacekeeping troops because of the country’s role in the Second World War.

Almost seven million Soviet Ukrainian civilians and military personnel died during the war, it is estimated.

Sources in Germany said it was in ‘exploratory discussions’ about taking part in an international force to protect monitors for the Organisation for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the ground in Ukraine amid deep concern of a return to full-scale violence in the east of the country.

The West fears Vladimir Putin is determined to build an unofficial buffer state called Novorossiya – or New Russia – in eastern Ukraine.

A dozen pro-Putin separatists were killed yesterday in intense fighting for control of strategic Donetsk airport. Two Ukrainian soldiers also died.

Ukraine claims Russia is swelling troop numbers on its borders in a bid to destabilise the fragile ceasefire.

More than 3,600 people have died in the conflict this year, according to the UN.
