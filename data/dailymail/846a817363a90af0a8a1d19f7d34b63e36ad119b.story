It's the one topic Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been trying to steer well away from during this weekend's G20 summit.

But with temperatures in Brisbane set to hit a scorching 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit) it seems that the topic of climate change will be unavoidable.

World leaders and their staffers will be forced to put up with the near-record heat, but police are especially worried about how the sweltering weather will affect protesters and the thousands of police manning the city streets on Sunday.

Protesters including this 'bikini reporter' have gone to extreme lengths to stay cool over the hot weekend, with temperatures hitting 32.2 degrees Celsius on Saturday and expected to exceed 40 degrees on Sunday

Deputy Commissioner Ross Barnett said police had a comprehensive plan to make sure they were kept well hydrated.

'We'll just have to manage that as best we can, but we certainly could have done without a 40 degree day,' Mr Barnett said.

The heat wave is being driven by northwesterly winds, which could also pose a problem for firefighters who are battling a number of blazes across the state.

Brisbane's November record of 41.2 degrees dates back to 1913. Sunday's temperature is expected to fall just short of that.

This comes after U.S. President Barack Obama gave a landmark speech at the G20 Summit on Saturday where he called for immediate action on climate change.

Mr Obama piled pressure on the Abbott government to act on emissions, declaring that natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef were under direct threat from climate change. 

The U.S. President said today that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena.

'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit,' he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause.

'I want that there 50 years from now.'

While the Australian government has attempted to keep the focus of the Asia-Pacific leaders' summit on economic growth and jobs, Mr Obama steered the focus back to climate change, following a historic U.S. deal with China to slash emissions.

While Australia has not made climate change a formal part of the 2014 G20 agenda, the final communique is expected to call on leaders to make clear their new carbon emission reduction targets before the Paris climate summit in December 2015.

British Prime Minister David Cameron also urged Mr Abbott to take out more insurance against climate change even if he doesn't believe in the threat.

Mr Cameron told Britain's Sky News on Saturday that at the next climate change talks in Paris every country had to bring something more to the table.

'But obviously countries that have so far done the least need to think about what more they can do and I've had good and friendly conversations with Prime Minister Abbott about that.'

When asked if Mr Abbott's scrapping of the carbon tax and cuts to renewable energy went against the trend of climate change action, Mr Cameron said Australia had set a cut in carbon emissions of some 5 per cent.

He said the Australian government saw that as an actual cut of 19 per cent if Australia had carried on with business as usual.

'I hope they'll do everything they can in the coming months to look at what more they can deliver because when it comes to Paris, if you want to get a global agreement, everyone's going to have to bring something to the table.'

Mr Cameron said it made sense to insure against climate change.

'I always say, think about it like insurance, even if you don't believe in the nature of this threat, isn't it better to insure against it?

'You might think there's only a 10 per cent chance of your house burning down but even if it's that percentage chance wouldn't you do something to try and make sure you can save your world, your environment for your children and your grandchildren?'

Mr Cameron said he had already had that conversation with Mr Abbott.
