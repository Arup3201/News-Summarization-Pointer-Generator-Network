Foreign patients will have to prove they are entitled to free NHS care in a clampdown on health tourism.

In order to register with a GP, EU nationals will be required to show their European Health Insurance Card.

The UK has, until now, been far less efficient than other countries in reclaiming the money owed for treating foreign citizens. 

As a result, the NHS is losing an estimated £400million a year simply because it is failing to identify EU patients and claw back the cost of their treatment from their governments.

Requirement: Receptionists will for the first time ask all new patients from European countries to show their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), pictured, otherwise they will be barred from registering

Under proposals obtained by Pulse magazine, GP surgeries will begin the process of redressing the balance.

The move could eventually be extended to cover patients from other parts of the world in a bid to save the NHS an estimated £2billion a year.

Receptionists will for the first time ask all new patients from European countries to show their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), otherwise they will be barred from registering. This will allow the NHS to flag up patients whose home countries should be paying for their treatment, particularly if they go on to be seen in hospital.

Under an EU agreement, citizens can be treated free of charge in other countries as long as their government repays the cost. 

But the UK claws back only £1 for every £15 we pay for Britons to be treated abroad. Last year the Government managed to collect £50million from EU countries but paid out £750million. 

A pilot scheme due to begin later this year is the first stage of an ambitious plan to recoup the cost of treating overseas patients.

The Department of Health is asking for ten practices to sign up. Receptionists will ask all new patients from the EU – including British citizens – to present their EHIC card when registering with surgery.

Many British patients have these cards but if they do not they should be able to use their passport or other form of identity as proof they are entitled to NHS care.

Patients from other EU countries will be recorded on a computer system so that NHS officials can compile a bill for the costs of their GP appointment and any further treatment.

Currently, certain NHS services – including GP appointments, A&E, maternity and any treatment deemed urgent or life-threatening – are free for everyone. But overseas patients – which include anyone who has lived here for less than 12 months – are meant to pay for all other hospital treatment, such as X-rays, consultations and operations. In reality, however, staff rarely recover these costs at present.

GPs are being used to identify those from whom cash can be reclaimed because they are the gateway to the NHS for most patients.

Some senior GPs criticised the move, suggesting it would turn them into debt collectors and may prevent seriously ill foreign patients from seeking help. 

Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chair of the British Medical Association and a retired GP in Lancashire, said: ‘The Health Secretary would be wise to concentrate on the major pressures on the NHS.

‘If this plan comes to fruition it will at best reduce the role of doctors to debt collectors. At worst it will deter them from registering migrants and asylum seekers as well as setting up a new system of charging that could be extended.’

But Dr Dean Marshall, a member of the BMA’s GP committee who has been working on the plans with the Department of Health, said they were designed to get staff used to asking for cards routinely.

He added: ‘We need to pilot it and see how much work it is. It will be extra administrative work potentially but it will hopefully clarify who is and who isn’t entitled to NHS care and clearly there is a huge amount of money being spent in the NHS on people who are not entitled to it. What we have been absolutely clear about is that this isn’t about the GPs becoming a police force.’

The Government is consulting on other plans which include making overseas patients pay 150 per cent of the cost of treatment, which would make it profitable for hospitals to chase the bills. Ministers are also consulting on proposals to introduce a £200 annual health levy for migrants who are here longer than six months.

The Department of Health said: ‘We are absolutely committed to improving the way the NHS recovers costs from international visitors.’
