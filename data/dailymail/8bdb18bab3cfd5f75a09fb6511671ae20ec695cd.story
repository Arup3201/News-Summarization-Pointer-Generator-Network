It'll never stir the passions like a Ferrari and you won't see its picture adorning the bedroom wall of the average adolescent teenage boy.

But the venerable Toyota Corolla has overtaken Fords F-series truck to become the best selling vehicle of all time.

The ultra-reliable, if perhaps rather dull, Japanese runaround has clocked up global sales of around 37.5 million since it was first rolled out in 1966.

Record breaker: The humble Toyota Corolla has become the world's best selling car of all time

Original: A first generation Toyota Corolla from 1966. Over the past 40 years one has been sold every 40 seconds

With its winning recipe of value-for-money,
thrifty gas mileage and a huge dealer network, a Corolla has been sold 
on average once every 40 seconds for the past 40 years.

Now into its tenth generation Corollas 
are  manufactured in Japan, Brazil, Canada, China, India, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela.

However production in the US, based in  Fremont, California, ended in March 2010.

Sales of the car really took off during the 1970s oil crisis as its frugal four cylinder engine offered great mileage, a feature that continues to add to its popularity today.

It's success brings to an end an impressive 24 year run by Ford's F-series pick-up truck which,  with sales of over 35 million, now pulls over into second place.

In third place is the Volkswagen Golf having notched up sales of 27.5 million.

VW's Beetle comes in at fourth with 23.5 million sold and Ford's Escort which has sold 20 million, is in fifth.

Despite only being in eighth place over all in terms of total sales many experts still rate the Ford Model T as the most successful car ever.

Nearly 17 million cars were produced 
between 1908 and 1927 -  a period when car ownership was far
less widespread than it is today.

Sporting pedigree: Corollas won Toyota the World Rally Championships Manufacturers Title in 1999

Like the Model T the Corolla succeeds because it is inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to operate, reliable and easy to repair.

Early Corollas were rear-wheel drive while later models were mostly front-wheel drive and some models were four-wheel drive.

The greatest: Boxer Muhammed Ali promotes the Corrolla at a press conference in London in 1980

Although always regarded as sensible rather than sporty the Corolla has had some racing pedigree.

In
1999 Toyota entered Corollas driven by Carlos Sainz and Didier Auriol 
into the World Rally Championship subsequently winning the manufacturers
title.

Despite concerns that the earthquake 
and Tsunami which hit Japan last year would seriously damage production, Toyota, which is Japan's largest vehicle manufacturer, has posted surprisingly upbeat sales predictions for next year.

The firm lifted its 2012 domestic 
sales forecast to 1.63 million vehicles, up 6.5 percent from its 
previous prediction and 36 percent higher than 2011, after the 
government last month decided to re-introduce subsidies for 
fuel-efficient cars.

It is expected to be among the 
biggest beneficiaries of such green car incentives and subsidies thanks 
to its broad line-up of hybrid vehicles, including the Aqua, its 
cheapest and most fuel-efficient hybrid to date, launched late last 
month.

The company's forecast for 18 percent
sales growth overseas was unchanged, bringing the global forecast to 
8.58 million vehicles, up 21 percent on the previous year, excluding 
Daihatsu and Hino.

That would be a record for the 
company, whose sales slipped 6 percent to 7.1 million vehicles in 2011, 
hampered by the massive earthquake in northeast Japan and Thai flooding.

Earlier this week on a visit to the Washington Auto show President Barack Obama hailed the rebound of the U.S. car industry.

Volkswagen's Golf (left) and Beetle (Right) are in third and fourth place respectively

Obama sat inside shiny new plug-in electric hybrids and burly trucks declaring, 'The U.S. auto industry is back.'

As Mitt Romney surged ahead in Florida's GOP primary, Obama emphasised his administration's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler from the brink of collapse rival.

The President told reporters it was 'good to remember the fact that there were some folks who were willing to let this industry die. Because of folks coming together we are now back at a place where we can compete with any car company in the world.'
