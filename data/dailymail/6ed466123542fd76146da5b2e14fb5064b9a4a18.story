Dustin Diamond, the actor who played Screech in the 1990s television show Saved By The Bell, appeared in a Wisconsin courtroom on Monday after posting bail on charges that he stabbed a man during a bar fight on Christmas.

Diamond, who spent the weekend in jail, posted $10,000 bail before his hearing in Ozaukee County Circuit Court. 

A criminal complaint charged that Diamond with second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon.

Defense attorney Thomas Alberti requested reduced bail and a jury trial for Diamond, 37, who was wearing street clothes and did not speak in court.

Diamond appeared in court with his fiancée on Monday just days after he was jailed for a knife attack at a bar

'Dustin has complete faith in the justice system,' Alberti said outside the courtroom. He added that Diamond was 'not happy he missed the Packers game' while in jail.

But Alberti said Diamond 'made the best of his time here. He got caught up on some books'.

The complaint said Diamond and his fiancee 27-year-old fiancée, Amanda Schutz, got into a tussle with two men and a woman at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, where Diamond lives, on Thursday night.

Diamond told police he accidentally stabbed one of the men while trying to defend his fiancee. The man was not seriously injured. Police say officers recovered a switchblade.

Diamond's next court hearing is scheduled for January 5.

The nineties star, best known for playing nerdy Samuel 'Screech' Powers for thirteen years, was taken into custody after getting into a dispute with another couple at the Grand Avenue Saloon on December 25.

FOX6 Now obtained the arrest report stating that Dustin did indeed injure the stabbing victim, identified as Casey.

'I moved his arm up and around, and I had the knife in my hand,' the former child actor told police officers during an interview shortly after the incident.

Dustin got involved in the fight after hearing Miss Schutz screaming due to 'two men holding her by the hair'.

After talking to officials about what happened, the couple drove away from the bar but were soon pulled over by police.

Upon the discovery of the knife, police showed Dustin a witness' video taken inside the bar. 

The actor admitted he had a knife, telling police he had received a new blade that day and owns several knives.

Victim Casey was interviewed  at his home while paramedics were tending to his 'half-inch puncture stab wound under his right armpit with substantial bleeding'. 

Fox6 Now interviewed Randy Buser, the owner of the Grand Avenue Saloon.

'It wasn't that eventful to be perfectly honest,' he admitted. 'His girlfriend or fiancee or whoever he was with pushed another girl, had a little altercation and he ended up pulling out a knife, put it right back into his pocket after.' 

Dustin's fiancee was charged with disorderly conduct and released according to Port Washington officials.
