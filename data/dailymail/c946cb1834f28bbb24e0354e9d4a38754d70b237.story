Cadaver dogs being used in the search for missing Utah woman Susan Powell have picked up scents at a desert location.

Police say no actual human remains have been found, despite earlier reports.

West Valley City Police Lt. Bill Merritt told the Associated Press: 'We have not come across bones.

Disappearance: Susan Cox Powell, a mother of two young children, was reported missing on December 7, 2009, when she was aged 28

'Right now, we haven't found anything except for these scents that these dogs are picking up.'

Earlier, police offered details about
the find, saying the remains near Topaz Mountain in Juab County, Utah, 
were recent and in what they told Powell's father amounted to a 'shallow
grave.'

West Valley City Police Sgt. Mike 
Powell added that an anthropologist even examined the remains to ensure 
that they were not bones 'of antiquity' that had been buried in the 
desert for decades.

'This is something that's going to be
interesting,' Sgt. Powell said earlier. 'We're not looking at some 
Indian burial ground or old cowboy from the West. It's much more recent 
than that.'

Police did not fully explain why they earlier said they had found remains.

Susan Cox Powell was 28 when she was 
reported missing in December 2009. However the remains have not yet been
identified by authorities.

Authorities
have been searching Utah's rugged desert for clues in the case of Mrs 
Powell, whose husband liked to camp in the area.

‘It's a game of patience at this 
point,’ a local police spokesman said. ‘We need to slow down a little 
bit and identify what it is we found.’

Mrs Powell went missing after failing
to show up for her stockbroker job. She was seen by friends at church 
and dinner the day before.

Her husband, Josh Powell, told police
he left his wife at home about 12:30am on the day she went missing in 
2009 to go winter camping.

He went in freezing temperatures with
their young sons - then ages 4 and 2 - on the Pony Express Trail, about
80 miles west of Salt Lake City.

The four-year-old confirmed the trip to police. Mr Powell said that when he came home less than two days later, his wife had vanished.

Mr Powell is the only person of 
interest in the case but has never been arrested or charged. Police 
claim he has been uncooperative.

Authorities have been searching since Monday in the area near Topaz 
Mountain in Juab County, Utah, and found the body with cadaver dogs.

The site is about 135 miles southwest of the location where Mrs Powell was last seen in West Valley City.

Concerns: Josh Powell, husband of Mrs Powell, is under a cloud of suspicion in her disappearance as he is the only person of interest in the case

Last month investigators searched mine shaft-dotted mountains near Ely, Nevada.

'I'm sure there are people who have died in the desert that nobody knows about'Chuck Cox, father of Susan Powell

In addition, West Valley City police served a search warrant on the Puyallup, Washington, home Mr Powell shares with his father.

They seized computers and journals thought to have belonged to her. Mr Powell said he will not be commenting on the body’s discovery.

This latest search is in an area popular for gem and rock hunters. Police have said Mrs Powell's husband liked to rock hunt in the area.

Mrs Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said he is not sure the remains are his daughter’s - as the search area is a very deserted place.

‘I'm sure there are people who have died in the desert that nobody knows about,’ he told NBC.

'It's gone from just bizarre to just unbearable for the family'

Anne Bremner, lawyer for Mrs Powell's family and Chuck Cox

The case has caused a major feud 
between the Cox and Powell families - with the latter claiming Mrs 
Powell ran off with another man, reported MSNBC.

Steve
Powell, Mr Powell’s father, sensationally claimed last month he had a 
flirtatious relationship with his daughter-in-law and they were in love.

But
this was denied by her parents and Cox family lawyer Anne Bremner, who 
claimed the Powells had gone from ‘bizarre to just unbearable’.

Mrs
Powell’s family won a court restraining order last month, which means 
Josh Powell and Chuck Cox must not come within 500ft of each other.
