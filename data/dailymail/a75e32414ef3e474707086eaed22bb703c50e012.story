George Osborne has come under fire after his car was photographed parked in a disabled space.

The Chancellor had stopped at a service station to get a McDonald’s lunch on the way back from an official visit to Cardiff.

When he emerged from the Mangor services on the M4, his driver had parked the silver Land Rover in a disabled parking bay.

Chancellor George Osborne was pictured standing outside the vehicle parked in a bay marked with yellow lines and a disabled parking logo

It is understood the vehicle was driven by police so can be legally parked anywhere – even without a blue badge.

But last night disability 
campaigners, furious at the Government’s cuts to welfare, used the 
incident to accuse Mr Osborne of arrogance.

It also has echoes of the 
Chancellor’s decision to sit in a first class train carriage last year, 
even though he only held a standard class ticket. He was forced to pay 
£160 for an upgrade.

Mr Osborne has said he had ‘no idea’ that the car had been in a disabled bay.

The driver of Mr Osborne's car reversed into the disabled parking space outside Magor services on the Eastbound side of the M4

Mr Osborne yesterday spent the day in Derby, where he tried his hand at guilding a cup with guilder Emma Dudley at Royal Crown Derby Pottery

Treasury sources said he had been 
dropped off at the door of the services, where he went in to buy fast 
food. The police driver then parked the car in a disabled bay in his 
absence.

A source close to Mr Osborne said: 
‘The Chancellor would not condone parking in a disabled parking bay. But
he had no idea this had happened.’

A witness is reported saying: ‘I 
couldn’t believe my eyes. The car park wasn’t exactly full and there 
were plenty of other, ordinary spaces.’

Richard Hawkes of disability charity 
Scope claimed the incident showed how ‘wildly out of touch the 
Chancellor is with disabled people in the UK’.

The use of the bay was ‘rubbing salt in the wounds’ of those suffering under the welfare reforms, Mr Hawkes declared.

A survey in 2007 of drivers voted the
Mangor services as the worst in Britain. It has since been refurbished 
and includes a McDonald’s – which aides revealed Mr Osborne has a 
weakness for.

Mr Osborne has been caught up in the row over benefits, after saying the case of Mike Philpott jailed for starting a fire which killed his six children highlighted the need to reform welfare
