Mario Mandzukic hit a brace as Atletico Madrid kept on their trail with a 3-1 victory in poor weather conditions at Eibar.

The champions are level on 47 points with second-placed Barcelona who face Villarreal on Sunday, while Real Madrid top La Liga on 51.

Atletico's Antoine Griezmann maintained his strong form as he fired home the opener from a Raul Garcia pass after seven minutes.

The pitch looked more like a quagmire in parts as a result of heavy rain but Atletico adapted well and the combative Mandzukic knocked in a Griezmann cross from the left wing to make it 2-0 in the 23rd minute.

Then two minutes later he seized on a loose ball in the area and drove it past keeper Xabier Iruretagoiena Aranzamendi. 

The visitors were rarely threatened in the second half although Federico Piovaccari headed in an 89th minute consolation goal.
