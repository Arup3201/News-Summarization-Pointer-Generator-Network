Leicester City completed a remarkable comeback at the King Power Stadium, turning a 3-1 deficit into a 5-3 victory over Manchester United.

Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players. 

Leicester 4-3-1-2:

Kasper Schmeichel 6 – Could have saved Van Persie’s header had it not nicked off Moore. Taken completely by surprise for Di Maria’s lob, wrong-footed by Herrera. 

Jamie Vardy assisted the first three goals, then scored Leicester's fourth and assisted the fifth

Richie De Laet 6.5 – Given a torrid time by Di Maria and got turned by Falcao for the opening goal but offered much as an attacking force as match went on.

Wes Morgan 6 – A solid presence at the heart of Leicester’s defence, marshalling his men amid the United onslaughts.

Liam Moore 6 – Showed strength to nudge Falcao off the ball in the first half and generally coped well with some awesome opponents.

Paul Konchesky 6 – United were quieter down his flank and largely enjoyed the better of his duels with Rafael. 

On his full debut for the club, Esteban Cambiasso scored Leicester's second-half equaliser 

Danny Drinkwater 7.5 – The former United academy player showed why he was named Championship player of the year last season. Some excellent passes.

Esteban Cambiasso 7.5 – What a finish he found just when Leicester need it. Had he not driven his shot with such accuracy the comeback might never have happened.

Dean Hammond 6.5 – Had few outstanding moments but was equally a composed figure in central midfield. Not small statement given the attacking force he had to contend with.

Leonardo Ulloa continues his fine form with another excellent headed goal against Manchester United

Dave Nugent 7.5 – Began confidently in the No 10 role, pulling the strings as Leicester’s front three combined well, and took his penalty with conviction.

Leonardo Ulloa 7.5 – Two more goals for the £8million signing to take his tally to five for the season. A bulldozing header and perfect penalty.

Jamie Vardy 8.5 – A nuisance all afternoon, surprising United’s backline with direct running at pace. Excellent cross for Ulloa’s goal.

Subs: King 6, James 6, Schlupp 6. All three came on to provide energy in the closing stages as United wilted. 

Nigel Pearson 8 –Fought fire with fire and left United feeling burnt. Picked a bold attacking team and it paid off spectacularly. 

Robin van Persie scored his first goal of the season, set up by loan singing Rdadmel Falcao

When Ander Herrera scored United's third, Louis van Gaal's side thought they'd wrapped it up

Manchester United 4-3-1-2:

David De Gea 5.5 – Conceded five goals but could not be faulted for any of them. Both penalties he faced were sure and the other finishes were out of reach.

Rafael 4.5 – Showed his defensive liability by rushing in to challenge Vardy after feeling hard-done by after his shove. Soft penalty but fell for it.

Rafael's foul, which was admittedly soft, on Vardy for the penalty was the start of Leicester's comeback

Jonny Evans 5 – Went off early after a crunching foul from Ulloa and looked like he could be out for some time sitting on the bench with crutches. 

Tyler Blackett 4.5 – Had been United’s best defender until he stood off for Cambiasso’s goal and then lunged foolishly at Vardy after being out-muscled to get sent off.

Marcos Rojo 4 – Was exposed defensively by Leicester’s pace and at fault for Ulloa’s first goal (allowing the cross) and Vardy’s finish (poor pass to Mata).

Ander Herrera 7 – Clever flicked finish to give United a 3-1 lead and generally a bright spark. But faded as the game went on.

Daley Blind 6 – Looked to have the screening job sorted in the first half but was simply overrun as Leicester surged forward scenting blood late on.

Angel di Maria 8 – Van Gaal might need to keep his star player on the pitch for the duration, such was his impact with runs from deep, sublime passing and scoring. 

Angel di Maria scored a delightful chip against Leicester at the King Power Stadium

Wayne Rooney 7 – Started well and his measured pass allowed Di Maria to scoop his shot first time. But grew irritated and could have been twice booked for dissent.

Robin van Persie 7 – Smart header to open his account for the season but was unable to control Di Maria’s pass in the second half and slipped out of the contest.

Rdamel Falcao 7.5 – Produced a superb cross with his left foot to set up the opening goal and cracked an instinctive half-volley with his right onto the crossbar.

Subs: Smalling 5, Mata 5, Januzaj 5. Smalling failed to bring any stability to United’s defence, Mata gave the ball away for Vardy’s goal and Januzaj was anonymous. 

Louis Van Gaal 6 – Big call to drop Mata and initially found success. But found to be defensively weak and his substitutions failed to address this.

Mark Clattenburg 5 – Got it horribly wrong for Leicester's first penalty, allowing Vardy's shove on Rafael before penalising the Brazilian for a lesser touch.
