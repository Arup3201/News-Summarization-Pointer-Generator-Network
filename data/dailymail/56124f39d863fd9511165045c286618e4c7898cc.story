The world’s fastest man Usain Bolt looks primed for the new athletics season, posting a picture of his gym workout.

The triple Olympic and World Champion sprinter resumed training in October after an injury-hit 2014 season and proved he’s in shape with a post on Instagram pumping some iron.

The six-time Olympic champion will hope to retain his world 100m and 200m crowns at the World Championships in Beijing in August later this year.

Bolt posted  a picture of him on a leg press machine on Instagram with the caption: ‘New Year, Same Mission, Same Goals #workneverstop #ForeverFaster #2015’.

Bolt only raced officially four times in 2014, including the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow where he anchored Jamaica to 4x100m relay gold.

Despite the lack of racing the Jamaican then managed in August 2014 to set a world indoor 100m record in Warsaw with a time of 9.98 seconds before ending his season prematurely to recover from a foot injury and train for his assault on the 2015 season.

Bolt, training in late December, has been recovering from a foot injury which curtailed his 2014 season
