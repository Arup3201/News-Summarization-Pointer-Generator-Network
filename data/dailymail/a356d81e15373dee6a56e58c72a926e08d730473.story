A male member of Match.com has used a spreadsheet to make sure he was able to distinguish between each of the eight women he was dating.

David Merkur, a 28-year-old investment banker from New York, used the Microsoft Excel tool to record details of each of the women's characteristics as well as progress reports on how his dates with them went.

Merkur told Jezebel.com he emailed the spreadsheet to Arielle, a woman he had dated, after their April 4 meeting because she 'worked with spreadsheets a lot too.' Arielle then forwarded the document to a group of her friends two days later which helped turn the document viral.

Merkur,Â who works for real-estate finance firm Ladder Capital, wrote
to Arielle: 'Well, this could be a mistake, but what the hell... 
figured I might as well give you the whole thing. I hope this email 
doesn't backfire, because I really had a great time and hope to hang 
again soon :)'

Order: David Merkur, a Match.com online dater from New York, made a spreadsheet 
(pictured in part above) to keep track of the eight women he had been 
dating

Perhaps most concerning was that Merkur 
passed on the information without removing the girls' telephone numbers,
email addresses, full names or details about their dates, such as how 
he scored their appearances. MailOnline has blurred out this personal 
information to protect the girls' identities.

Arielle then emailed her friends: 'Wanted to pass this on to you for some monday morning entertainment. I went on a date with this guy last wednesday.

'On the date, he tells me that he has a spreadsheet for tracking all of the people from Match that are 'in process.' Naturally, I tease him and ask him to send me the spreadsheet. For some strange reason, he actually does. See below/attached. Just when I thought I had seen it all...'

The spreadsheet was split into various 
categories including 'Monitor closely' and 'Monitor casually' columns. 
It detailed sent text messages and email exchanges as well as the venues
in which Dave and his date met.

Leaked: David Merkur emailed the spreadsheet to one of his dates who 
forwarded it to her friends, adding: 'Just when I thought I'd seen it 
all'

The
document detailed his thoughts on 
the women's physical appearances, giving each a score out of ten, with 
some being awarded a 7.0 or 7.5 for their 'mixed bag of pictures' on the
website.

Arranged in alphabetical order, 
Arielle, the woman he sent the email to, is top of the list. Not 
concerned with playing it cool, he failed to remove his thoughts on her 
including: 'Hope to see again soon'. Judging by her message as she 
forwarded the spreadsheet to her friends, it now seems unlikely.

And even though he hoped to see her 
again, he did not think to remove flattering details about his other 
dates including top scores for appearances, and the fact he'd 'hooked 
up' with one of the girls at a party. Another entry reads: 'OK girl, but very jappy', a slang word for 'Jewish American princess'.

And for a man who treats women so well 
he deems it appropriate to make a spreadsheet just to remember their 
names, home towns and first dates, it is perhaps unsurprising that he 
wrote how one stood him up, claiming a friend was in hospital.

In a second page, he lists the women he 
has met through friends, rather than the dating website. With these 
women, he had the forethought to remove their identities. He added in the email to Arielle: 'I 
only deleted the non-match people's names (at the bottom) since some 
I've known for a long time.'

Merkur
told Jezebel.com he regrets making the spreadsheet, labelling it 'an 
extraordinarily dumb decision'. He then explained his thought process.

He
said: 'I work with spreadsheets a lot... it's a great additional tool. I
work long days, go to the gym, go out on a couple of midweek dates or 
what not, get home late... how am I going to remember them? I'm not.

'So I made the spreadsheet. My comments aren't malicious or mean. This was an honest attempt to stay organised.'

Merkur told The New York Post that he was sorry for making the document. 'I sincerely regret my serious lapse in judgment in this matter and apologise to everyone,' he said. 'I am deeply remorseful.'

Merkur awarded his highest score for appearance, a 9.5, to Lilana Beidaut, who he described as: 'looks beautiful; from coastal Romania; Chanel make-up artist.'

But he added: 'Old BF may be back in the picture.'

Speaking to MailOnline, Beidaut admitted that this is a line she gives men when she is not interested.

Even though Merkur was 'a really nice guy who wanted to get serious about a girl', she said she was just too busy to continue contacting him.

The 26-year-old, who never met Merkur in person, insisted it was nothing he had done wrong - adding that she does not even blame him for making the spreadsheet.

'He's a smart guy and he want to keep 
track of everything,' she said. 'He wanted to make sure he was approaching the women
correctly - they're all beautiful girls. He's a lucky guy.'

Yet she added that she did blame Arielle for forwarding it to her friends.

'I'm blaming her,' Beidaut said. 'He trusted her. He wanted to find a cool girl and was reaching out to her. I think she was uncool.

'She could have removed my information - she could have at least removed my name. Now my details are being posted all over blogs and my phone is ringing and ringing. I should send her my phone bill.'

Beidaut said that she was flattered by Merkur's description of her on the spreadsheet and the fact he had been 'persistent' in calling her.

She added that she is now in a committed relationship and will not be getting back in touch with him.

She does feel sorry for the last girl on the spreadsheet though, who Merkur said was 'jappy' - slang for Jewish American Princess.

The girl told Jezebel.com that Merkur was 'fidgety' when the pair met, adding: 'He got up to readjust himself a few times in the middle of our conversation, which was bizarre. He kept taking his glasses off and then putting them on again.'

In reference to the tag, she said she thought it was funny he had called her that, despite being shocked he had kept a spreadsheet in the first place.

She recalled Merkur correctly identifying her designer handbag during their date, which probably led to the tag. 'He said his mom had it,' she said.

Speaking with the Post, Merkur added: 'Suffice it to say, I will never do anything like this again.'
