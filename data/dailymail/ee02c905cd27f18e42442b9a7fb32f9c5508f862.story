Victim: Hani Abou El-Kheir, pictured, was fatally stabbed by a gang wielding knives and swords in the Pimlico area of London last night

A boy of 16 pleaded ‘don’t do it’ moments before he was killed by a hooded gang wielding knives and swords in a street lined with multi-million-pound homes.

Hani Abou El Kheir tripped as he desperately tried to escape from around 15 teenagers wearing hoods and bandanas who were chasing him.

Moments later the gang pounced ‘like a pack of dogs’ and Hani was repeatedly kicked and stabbed as he pleaded for his life.

His attackers left him for dead and jogged off ‘as if nothing had happened’.

Hani’s mother Pauline Hickey, 39, with whom he lived in a nearby flat, was said to have been ‘wailing’ as she was held back at a police cordon while medics tried to save her son.

He died in hospital less than two hours later.

The attack took place at about 6.45pm on Sunday in Pimlico, an affluent district in central London where Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has a home.

On the north side of the street where Hani was attacked are houses worth millions of pounds.

However, to the south sits the crime-ridden Churchill Gardens estate, which has recently seen a sharp rise in drugs offences, according to a youth worker.

Yesterday one witness to the attack said: ‘We saw him running really fast but then he tripped.

'There were about 15 of them, most wearing dark hoodies and bandanas over their faces. A lot of them were wearing tracksuits.

Horrific: The stabbing happened close to the junction of Lupus Street and Westmorland Place shortly before 7pm

‘They had wide kitchen knives and 
other knives and they jumped on him like a pack of dogs. He was shouting
 ‘‘don’t do it’’ but they just went ahead.

'One put a blade in near his ribs. Others then kicked him before just jogging off as if nothing had happened.

‘They put their weapons in socks and 
then shoved them up their sleeves as they were going. We tried to help 
him as he was lying on the ground.’

Community: Neighbours this afternoon described the victim  as a 'nice boy, polite'

Teodor Watson, 22, who lives in a flat overlooking the crime scene, said he heard what sounded like a brawl.

‘I heard a lot of commotion, the victim was shouting,’ he said.

‘I came outside and saw the victim standing and holding his stomach.

'There were about three or four young 
blokes running down the street. He was reeling and swaying for about 20 
seconds and then fell.’

Mohammed Alzubaidi, 49, said his friend witnessed a gang of black and white teenagers carrying out the attack.

‘He said they were carrying knives, some of them with wide swords,’ he added.

Hani is understood to have suffered multiple stab wounds to his chest and stomach.

Within minutes of the stabbing, his mother ran up to the police cordon.

Crime scene: The scene in Lupus Street is still cordoned off this morning as police investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack on the boy

Steve Russell, 46, a project manager, 
said: ‘She was screaming with grief and shouting her son’s name but they
 wouldn’t let her through.’

Miss Hickey, who is separated from Hani’s father Hicham, was too upset to talk about the loss of her son yesterday.

But in a note attached to a floral 
tribute near the scene she wrote: ‘My heart is broken. I love you so 
much. The pain is unbelievable. Your loving mum.’

A man at the family home said: ‘He didn’t deserve to end up on a slab. He was a nice boy.’

Forensics: Police were called to the scene on Lupus Street in Pimlico, central London, at 6:50pm last night

Forensics officers were  yesterday scouring the scene for clues. Last night Scotland Yard said no arrests had  been made.

It remained unclear what led to the 
murder. One theory is that Hani became caught up in a row over the sale 
of drugs on the estate.

Youth worker David Savizon said Hani was ‘on the periphery of having some sort of contact with gangs or activity such as drugs’.

He added: ‘We are very concerned about the impact of drugs, and competition between dealers in this area.

‘Younger and younger children are 
being recruited. From the ages of ten or 11 they are enticed by a £20 
note to act as runners and it escalates from there.’

Hani had been a pupil at the nearby Pimlico Academy but left some time ago and is thought to have been unemployed.

Jerry Collins, head of Pimlico 
Academy, said: ‘Hani was a popular boy who conducted himself in an 
exemplary manner and will be much missed.’

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 
‘It is heartbreaking to see the life of another young Londoner taken so 
tragically. My thoughts are with this young man’s family at such a 
terrible moment.

‘This horrific incident serves as an 
unwelcome reminder that although violent crime in the capital continues 
to fall, we must continue our fight to tackle youth violence and get 
knives off our streets.’

Hani is the first teenager to be murdered in London this year.

Last year aspiring football coach Oliver Husseini, 17, was left fighting for his life after being stabbed in a nearby street.
