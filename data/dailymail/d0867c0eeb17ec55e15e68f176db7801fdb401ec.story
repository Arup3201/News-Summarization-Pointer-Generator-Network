Growing up can be hard. From the braces and awkward growth spurts to fashion mishaps and the pressure of trying to keep up with your peers.

However, Utah graphic designer and photographer Merilee Allred is reclaiming those goofy years with a photo project to show that despite the embarrassing school photos, those awkward years can inspire people on to bigger and better things.

Her Awkward Years Project features adults who were bullied at school, but have gone on to amazing careers, traveled the world and, most importantly, learned to love themselves.

'Queen of the nerds': Merilee Allred started the Awkward Years Project to help get over her memories of being bullied

Strength: Autumn, who was bullied by her classmates and her teacher, says the picture reminds her to feel proud of what she has come through

From charity worker and celebrity reporter Autumn, who was even ridiculed by her teacher over the leg braces she had to wear in school, to Martie, who used to be teased over her looks but found through true friends that she could enjoy life and be herself, the project chronicles how the path to a happy life does not come with designer clothes or fancy hairstyles.

Merilee's inspiration came from her own experiences, after a friend refused to believe she had ever suffered an awkward phase and asked for photographic proof.

The self-described Queen of the Nerds said even though she had put the years of bullying behind her, she was reluctant to share her old school photo.

'You know that mentality of overweight 
people who have lost so much weight but they still see themselves as 
fat? That’s how I feel. I may look normal now, but I still see myself as
 an awkward nerd,' she said.

'I wanted to take a picture of myself then and now, 
as if I had to hold my 5th grade self’s hand before giving it to my 
friend.'

Growing pains: Chef Mark admits his awkward phase came after leaving high school

Embracing the past: Daisy has come to love the characteristics that marked her out as 'different' at school

Her experiences made Merilee decide to start her Awkward Years Project, which currently features eight men and women who came through bullying.

Some were able to laugh off their experiences, such as Gina who posed with a contact sheet of three school photos, and claimed that no one had wanted to cut one out and frame it.

Others, such as Merliee's sister Martie, who was teased for her looks, not only grew out of her awkward years, but went on to become a model who travels the world doing photo shoots.

Chef and photographer Mark, who posed in a denim shirt, cap and suspenders was also ready to admit that his awkward years came after he had finished high school.

Many in the project, such as roller derby skater and journalist Daisy, described how they have come to embrace the very characteristics they had been teased about.

Daisy, who grew up in a farmhouse in the British countryside, said she was teased for being different when she went to school but added: 'As I got older I started to reclaim those "different" things as a source of great pride.'

On to better things: Stacey left behind her school years to travel to China, where she taught English

Accepting: Gina was able to joke about her awkward photos, claiming no one wanted to put them in a frame

Be yourself: Martie says her years of being teased taught her to value her real friends

For Autumn, the project was a cathartic experience. She suffered years of bullying - from fellow pupils and even her teacher - because of her health problems.

In her section on the online project she said: 'Looking at this picture brings up many emotions. A lot of sadness over the way I was treated and what I went through. But also pride, because I bore it all and the outcome isn’t so bad.'

Her experience is at the core of what Merilee wanted to achieve. In her own profile on the project, which can be seen on the designer's website, she said: 'If I can share that part of my past next to the person that I turned out to be, I can embrace my little nerdy self and be OK with it.'
