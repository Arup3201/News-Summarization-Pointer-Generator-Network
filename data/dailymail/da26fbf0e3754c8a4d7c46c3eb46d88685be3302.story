Aspiring politicians should not be allowed to become MPs until they are 40, Andrew Marr has said.

The former BBC political editor said politicians should have to ‘do something first’ to tackle a lack of ‘gritty real-world experience’ in the House of Commons.

The broadcaster, 55, who presents BBC current affairs programme The Andrew Marr Show, pointed out that MPs used to spend years in different careers first.

Many had ‘built their own companies and knew the inside out of a balance sheet’.

Currently, there are 56 MPs under the age of 40. They comprise 25 Labour members, 24 Conservatives, six Liberal Democrats and one Plaid Cymru member. Prominent Tories include Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, 39, and business minister Matthew Hancock, 36.

Labour’s list includes 35-year-old shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and shadow minister for public health Luciana Berger, 33. The number could increase after the 2015 general election, since 115 of the candidates selected so far from all parties are in their 30s – and 43 are under 30.

Marr made his comments while speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival about his first novel, Head of State.

The presenter, who has been reporting on parliamentary affairs for 30 years, said MPs had very different backgrounds when he started out as a journalist.

Asked for his views on modern politics, he replied: ‘I’m turning into an old git, so I’ll give you a passionate old git response to that.

‘When I started out politics reporting, there were still Tories who had had a good war, built their own companies, had really good experience, knew the inside out of a balance sheet, had employed and sat and worried about profits. On the Labour side you had ex-miners, metal workers, ex-factory hands, ex-posties. So there were people all over the House of Commons who had done other things first and that really mattered.

‘We’ve lost most of that gritty, real-world experience in the House of Commons. I would like to see nobody – this is ridiculous but I’m going to say it anyway – nobody in the House of Commons until they are 40. That way they always have to do something first.’

In the wide-ranging interview, Marr also lamented the fact that today’s politicians have lost a ‘radical amount of power’ and ‘can’t even tax the biggest companies in this country’.

On his own career, he said: ‘If I had my time again I would spend more time over economics text books, really trying to understand economics jargon, to explain what they’re doing in clear terms because that drives everything else.’

Andrew Marr has given colourful insight into the prime ministers who have passed through Downing Street during his career as a political journalist.

Speaking in Cheltenham, he revealed that in Tony Blair’s time, Number 10 was full of ‘very beautiful girls’ who were ‘half in love with him’, while his wife Cherie would follow him around ‘with a scowl’. 

After the 1997 election, Mr Blair was famously pictured with the record-breaking 101 female Labour MPs – dubbed the Blair Babes.

In contrast, Gordon Brown was surrounded by ‘a gang of rather overweight big boys with red faces who glared a lot and came from Scotland’.

On Lady Margaret Thatcher, Marr recalled: ‘The whole place was almost pin-drop silent in case the PM walked through. They adored her, but were terrified of her.’

But her successor John Major felt ‘besieged’, Marr claimed. ‘It felt as if there were forces out there, Thatcherite forces, socialist forces, all ganging up. He was sitting there feeling misunderstood and unloved.’

Marr praised David Cameron, saying he is loved by the civil service because ‘all they want is for decisions to be taken clearly’.

He added: ‘They send him papers in the evening and he’s the first PM since Blair where the papers come back the following morning and he has read them all, ticked and underlined and said yes or no. He conducts the business of Number 10 very well.’

Marr joked that Boris Johnson’s ‘limitless ambition’ means he won’t be happy until he is prime minister – ‘and then he would want the White House’.
