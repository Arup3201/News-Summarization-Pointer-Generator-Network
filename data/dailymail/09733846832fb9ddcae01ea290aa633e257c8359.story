Shrewsbury fans queuing up for tickets for their glamour Capital One Cup tie against Chelsea were served tea by familiar faces - manager Micky Mellon and his players.

Die-hard Shrews waited in the freezing cold for a chance to see Jose Mourinho’s side in action at Greenhous Meadow on October 28.

‘They’re here to get tickets for a massive event and if I can give them a cup of tea and make them smile then good,’ said Mellon.

‘We want to make sure we’ve got that link between the fans and the club.’

And the supporters had slightly more chance of seeing their heroes take on the might of Diego Costa and Co.

The club have managed to boost the home capacity with 486 temporary seats thanks to funding from Capital One.

Mellon has guided his team to eighth in League Two, just one point off the play-off places

It means Greenhous Meadow will play host to a crowd in excess of 10,000 for the first time.

Shrews chief Matt Williams said: ‘The tie with Chelsea has really captured the imagination of our fans, wherever you go in the town people are talking about it.

‘The demand in tickets has been huge and to be able to accommodate an extra 486 fans is fantastic.

‘We’re hugely grateful to Capital One as this wouldn't have been possible without its financial support.’
