Jimmy Anderson stands on the brink of greatness. Burnley’s favourite son will begin the final Test of the series against India at The Oval on Friday needing eight more scalps to become England’s leading wicket taker of all-time.

The man the 32-year-old is aiming to overtake? Only Sir Ian Botham.

Already England’s leading international wicket taker in all formats with 649 — of which 376 have come in Tests — Anderson has morphed from a tearaway young fast bowler, whose early career performances veered from the sublime to the ordinary, into one of the most consistent swing bowlers of all-time.

Top man: Jimmy Anderson will be gunning for Sir Ian Botham's record as he sits just eight wickets off him

His fiercely competitive nature has landed him in hot water on occasions — most notably the recent verbal spat with Indian batsman Ravi Jadeja — but he will undoubtedly be remembered, when his career does come to an end, as one of England’s greatest.

‘James was always extremely competitive,’ said his dad, Michael. ‘I wouldn’t say he had a win-at-all-costs approach but he was extremely competitive, yes. The whole family are. We’ve all played a lot of sport.

‘Even at the age of 10 or 11, if I beat him at golf wouldn’t speak to me for a couple of days after that. When he was around 15 or 16 he grew between six and nine inches in a year, put on a couple of yards of pace over the winter and had a few lads hopping around in the nets.

‘I remember batting against him in the nets around that time and one day deciding “I don’t think I fancy that any more”. It was around that time we started to think there might be something special there.’

It was around that time the young Burnley Cricket Club fast bowler began attracting the attention of Lancashire’s selectors. Former England all-rounder Mike Watkinson was then the coach and he recalls what marked the quickie out from the rest.

‘He was a quiet lad, potentially shy, very respectful,’ Watkinson said. ‘He always worked hard and was very determined. He was perhaps a little bit nervous of the environment he found himself in but he has an inner strength and confidence.

‘He had some pace and the ability to swing the ball consistently. There was a snap and a quirkiness to his action which made him slightly unpredictable and batsman always seemed to be rushed when they faced him.’

After breaking into the England one-day side as a 20-year-old in late 2002, the same year he made his first-class debut, Anderson excelled at the World Cup in 2003, taking a hat-trick against Pakistan.

He took five for 73 on his Test debut against Pakistan the following year but struggled to nail down a regular place in the starting XI, with world-class fast bowlers Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff forming England’s pace attack during the fabled 2005 series as Anderson carried the drinks.

A stress fracture of his back the following year gave him the chance to tweak his action and to make important strength and conditioning improvements to improve his core strength and ensure it did not become a recurring nightmare.

‘When Jimmy came on the scene he was able to offer something to English cricket that we didn’t really have then,’ said his former Lancashire team-mate and his friend, Luke Sutton. ‘He was 90mph bowler with an unusual action who was young and exciting. He was different.

‘But it hasn’t all gone perfectly for him. Growing up when you’re on the international scene is tough because if you have a loss of form everybody sees it. Then obviously he had his stress fracture in 2006 and at that point his international career was really in the balance. But from then on he hasn’t really looked back.

‘However longer he plays for will largely come down to fitness. But if he remains fit then he’ll be taking wickets. If he plays for another two or three years he could achieve a level in cricket that very few people have got to in the history of the game. Real greatness.’

Multitalented: Anderson had a good go with the bat too as England dominated in the fourth Test

With more overs already under his belt than any bowler in English history, it is inevitable Anderson will have rubbed a few batsmen up the wrong way. He has worked on his mental approach to the game with England psychologist Mark Bawden, calling himself Jimmy on the field, and James off it.

‘When any sportsman plays he has an arousal state he needs to get to in order to perform at his best. If he pushes past it he won’t perform and if he doesn’t reach it he won’t perform,’ said Watkinson. ‘Some people need to get themselves revved up to a particular level. We play the game to rules with parameters for behaviour and we all know what is acceptable and unacceptable. You get out there and play hard and get on with it. We’ve never had any issues with Jimmy at all. He’s a very determined cricketer who gives you a very hard battle when you play against him.’

His combative, in-your-face on-field persona is at odds with his off-field image as a quiet, reserved man with a dry sense of humour.

‘He’s got lots of sides to his personality,’ Sutton adds. ‘He’s a very quiet guy but he’s got a very funny side to him. He’s always after a practical joke or a laugh. His favourite impression is Cliff Richard meets Luke Sutton. I find it very difficult to have a conversation with him without him breaking into that at some point.’

Next week at The Oval, his dad Michael and mum, Catherine, will be in the crowd desperate for their son to succeed.

‘I’m proud of what he’s done and what he’s achieved,’ Michael added. ‘It’s unbelievable for us really.

‘We just sit there and watch. Even now after 11 years of him playing for England you so sometimes look around and think ‘that’s our little boy out there playing for England.’
