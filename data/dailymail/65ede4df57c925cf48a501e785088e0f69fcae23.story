Chelsea are confident that Andre Schurrle's move to Wolfsburg will go through despite comments from Klaus Allofs, sporting director at the Bundesliga club, that a fee still needs to be negotiated. 

Juan Cuadrado’s arrival is dependent on Schurrle leaving and the German window shuts at 5pm UK time - with the delay surrounding a solidarity payment owed to club's in the player's development.

Schurrle’s terms aren’t the problem - a four-year deal at £85,000 a week – for Wolfsburg but neither club want to pay five per cent of the transfer fee.

The Bundesliga club, who are second in the table and beat leaders Bayern Munich 4-1 on Friday, are refusing to budge, as are Chelsea. 

Schurrle needed to beat a noon deadline to be registered on the German FA's transfer list before potentially completing a switch. That was done under an hour beforehand as the move goes down to the wire.

Schurrle remains in London, with general manager Klaus Allofs saying: 'Chelsea agreed to putting him on the transfer list just before midday and you can read into that what you want.' 

Furthermore, Schurrle's contract will run until 2019, with the winger earning around £85,000 a week.

It would be a record transfer for the German club and the huge expenditure is causing the delay in agreeing a deal, meaning the transfer is likely to go down to the wire on Monday. 

Chelsea are exepected to announce the £26m signing of Cuadrado from Fiorentina on Monday.

Cuadrado is seen as a replacement for both Schurrle and Mohamed Salah, who has agreed to go on loan to the Italian side.
