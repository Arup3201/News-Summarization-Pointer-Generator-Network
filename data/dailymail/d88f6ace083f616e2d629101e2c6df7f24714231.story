Controversy: Alessandra Mussolini's husband has been caught up in in a police investigation into underage prostitution

The granddaughter of fascist leader Benito Mussolini has been inadvertently caught up in a schoolgirl sex scandal that has caused shockwaves across Italy.

The husband of politician Alessandra Mussolini is accused of using teenage prostitutes from affluent backgrounds, who sold their bodies for extra pocket money to buy designer clothes.

Revelations that the girls made after school appointments with male clients, near their homes in Parioli, the capital's most well-heeled district, have shocked Rome’s upper middle classes.

The pair aged 14 and 15 charged up to 300 euros a time.

Prostitution is not against the law in Italy but it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18.

Now police poring through the girls’ mobile phone records have compiled a list of 20 suspects, including Mauro Floriani, Mrs Mussolini’s husband of more than 20 years.

Mr Floriani, a former police officer in the tax and customs division, nicknamed Captain Mussolini, gave himself up to the authorities but denies having sex with either girl. He was questioned and remains under investigation.

The former police officer has three children with the granddaughter of Il Duce, a former actress who is a niece of Sixties sex symbol Sophia Loren.

In 1990 Alessandra Mussolini gave up acting and went into politics. She is now an MP in Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party. Former Italian premier Berlusconi is currently appealing a conviction for sex with underage prostitute Ruby the Heartstealer.

It is not the first time that mother 
of three Mrs Mussolini has caused controversy - six years ago she hit 
out at transgender opposition MP Vladimir Luxoria saying: 'I'd rather be
 fascist than gay.'

Benito
 Mussolini's youngest son, jazz player Romano, was the father of 
Alessandra and the famous actress Sophia Loren is also her aunt.

Mussolini was in power from 1922 until 1943 when he was executed after being caught by partisans.

His body was hung upside down from a lamp post in Milan.

Technically
 it is against the law to have fascist symbols or memorabilia but there 
is a ready market in artefacts from the era and Mussolini's grave in 
Predappio near Forli has become a shrine for neo Fascists.
