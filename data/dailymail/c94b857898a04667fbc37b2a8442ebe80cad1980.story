Ched Evans has been pictured for the first time since being released from prison following his conviction for raping a woman in Rhyl in 2011.

The former Sheffield United striker was spotted with girlfriend Natasha Massey as they arrived in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, to visit her parents on Monday morning.

Massey has stuck by Evans throughout his prison sentence, despite them being in a relationship when he raped his victim in a hotel room three years ago.

The Blades, the club which employed him at the time of his conviction, are still deliberating whether to re-sign the striker with more than 150,000 people having signed an online petition campaigning against him returning to professional football.

However, many fans chanted their support for Evans during United's 2-0 victory at Bradford City on Saturday.

Evans, who was released from Wymott Prison in Lancashire at 5am on Friday, showed a disregard for his victim in his first interview since leaving prison. 

'I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock. I am very lucky my girlfriend (Natasha Massey) has stood by me,' he told the Sunday Mirror.

Evans has said cheating on his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, was 'unforgivable' and thanked her for her support

'She knows I am not capable of rape. She has helped me to cope. I want to play football again but I am determined to prove my innocence.

'I really thought it would have been thrown out of court and I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong. It was something that should never have happened. And it is something that I will regret for the rest of my life.

'I cheated on my girlfriend and had sex with this girl —but it was definitely consensual. Although I am ashamed of my actions, she was definitely up for it. I most certainly didn't rape anyone.

An inquiry into the rape conviction of Evans is to be fast-tracked. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is expected to begin its investigation into the case within weeks.

Ms Massey has led a campaign to have Evans' conviction overturned; his case review is to be fast-tracked 

The victim is captured on CCTV at the hotel, where she had initially gone with McDonald

McDonald was cleared of raping the victim, above, but Evans was convicted and sentenced to five years jail

In May 2011, Evans had been out with his brother and a friend of his, along with McDonald. The group went to a bar and then had a kebab.

Evans said McDonald decided to go back to his hotel and hailed a cab, at which point the victim appeared and asked to go with him. 

Evans took a separate taxi with his brother and his brother's friend, but then received a text from McDonald saying he had 'got a girl'.

He then told his taxi driver to head for the hotel, where he had booked and paid for a room under McDonald's name. 

Evans said when he entered the room McDonald was having sex with the woman and he asked if he could join in. He claims the woman said yes.

When they had finished having sex, Evans said the woman rolled over, so he left.

The prosecution's case was that the woman was too drunk to consent to sex. She had no memory of events after 3am and told police she woke up 'confused and dazed'.
