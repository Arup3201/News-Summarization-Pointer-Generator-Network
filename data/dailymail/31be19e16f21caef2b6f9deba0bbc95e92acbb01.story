A baby whose father plotted to kill her  while she was still in the womb is now four months old.

Jamie Smith was jailed for seven years after his plot to hire thugs to attack his pregnant mistress in Peterborough in Cambridgeshire and kill their baby, was foiled.

Smith paid Steven Blades and a third man to attack Jessika Santos, 18, after she became pregnant during their affair, but was foiled when the third man told police about the plot.

Baby Nyara was born four months ago after her father was jailed for seven years for plotting an attack on Jessika Santos, the child's mother, to make her miscarry their child. He was due to pay an accomplice 

Miss Santos has been pictured with their child, Nyara, just months after giving birth. 

She said: ‘How could anyone think of doing harm to something so beautiful and fragile?

‘Dads should be there to protect their children, not hurt them. I’ll never come to terms with what Jamie did.’

Miss Santos discovered she was pregnant after a one night-stand with Smith, 23, in January last year.

The pair had rekindled an online friendship that had begun three years earlier. After they met for the first time they had sex in Jamie’s black Toyota - with Miss Santos unaware that Smith was cheating on long-term girlfriend Faith Dancy.

Miss Santos said: ‘Literally hours after we made love, Jamie texted to say he couldn’t see me again because he was already with someone else.

‘I was furious, but I’ve been let down by guys before so it hardly came as a surprise.’

The teenager broke off contact with Smith but when she discovered she was pregnant got in touch to tell him. He immediately told her he wanted her to have an abortion. 

Miss Santos refused and Smith hatched the plot to have her attacked with a knife and a crowbar so she would lose their unborn child. 

Miss Santos said she will never come to terms with her former lover plotting to kill their baby in the womb 

The pair were due to meet up in February last year but on the day they were due to see each other police knocked on Miss Santos' door with the news that a tip-off had led to his arrest. 

Miss Santos added:  ‘A man had gone to the police telling them Jamie had tried to hire him and Blades to beat me up.

‘Jamie had been plotting to take me for a walk beside the lake at the local rowing club.

‘We’d be jumped by two ‘strangers’, one carrying a knife. Jamie would be knocked out cold and I’d be attacked with a wheel brace.

‘He’d even gone as far as to supply the pair with weapons.

‘The whole thing was meant to look like a random mugging - and designed to ensure I had a miscarriage and lost our baby.

‘Luckily, one of the men Jamie tried to hire had a conscience. Telling the police had foiled the whole thing.’

Smith was jailed for seven years in August last year after a jury found him guilty of conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm at the end of a five-day trial.

Blades, also 23, admitted the same charge and was jailed for 12 months.

As part of the plot Smith was also to be injured to make it look more believable.  

Miss Santos gave birth on September 23rd at Peterborough City Hospital.

She added: ‘It’s hard to not to think of Jamie when I look at Nyara - she looks so much like him and has the same blue-grey eyes.

‘I’m so angry that he could have even considered taking her life.

‘Of course parenthood is hard, but Nyara’s smile makes it all worthwhile. It’s Jamie’s loss that he didn’t want her.’
