A police officer is facing a disciplinary hearing after he allegedly used a police helicopter's thermal camera to record people having sex at dogging sites.

Police Constable Adrian Pogmore, 48, is suspected of watching people at dogging sites and recording a couple having sex in a country lane while on patrol in the South Yorkshire Police helicopter.

The father-of-two, based in Sheffield, has now been suspended and is facing an internal police hearing later this month after his wife reported him following the breakup of their marriage, it was reported.

A source told The Sun: 'He's accused of looking at dogging sites while the chopper was meant to be on patrol. It is also claimed he took footage of a couple having sex down a country lane.'

South Yorkshire Police confirmed a police officer had been suspended following an allegation of 'unauthorised use of force visual recording equipment'.

The misuse of the thermal camera is alleged to have occurred in 2008 while the helicopter was deployed for legitimate policing purposes.

However, PC Pogmore was only suspended on December 5 last year after he split from his wife Lesley, the paper reported.

A police spokesman said: 'The officer was interviewed around an alleged breach of standards of professional behaviour in relation to discreditable conduct. A search was carried out at the officer's address, with his consent, and no disc has been recovered.

'A second South Yorkshire officer inside the helicopter at the time of the alleged incident was also subject to a Professional Standards investigation.

'This pilot is employed by the National Police Air Service (NPAS) and his involvement has been investigated and no misconduct was identified. This report will be referred to NPAS for their consideration.'

The thermal camera attached to the South Yorkshire Police helicopter records video which is then replayed on television screens inside the aircraft

When contacted by MailOnline, PC Pogmore declined to comment.

The thermal camera used on the South Yorkshire Police helicopter is a Wescam MX15, which police boast as being 'equally effective day or night'.

It contains two daylight cameras, as well as the thermal imaging camera that records video which is then displayed on television screens inside the aircraft.

The South Yorkshire Police website states: 'The camera system, while the most expensive part of the aircraft, is among the best in world. It is used to search open areas, both rural and urban, not only to trace offenders but to locate missing persons resulting in numerous lives being saved.'
