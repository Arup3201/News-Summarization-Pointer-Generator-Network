An investigation has been launched  into bad language during the broadcast of Monty Python’s farewell show – because viewers complained there wasn’t enough of it.

Watchdog Ofcom received 34 complaints objecting to ‘cuts’ and ‘censorship’ after some of the swearing was cut out of the live programme.

The show went out before the 9pm watershed on Gold on July 20.

It was filmed during the final night of the Pythons’ reunion at London’s O2 Arena, where the troupe – John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones – performed.

An Ofcom spokesman said: ‘All our licensees are required to comply with our broadcasting rules, which make clear that the most offensive language cannot be shown on television before the watershed.’

'As a post-transmission regulator, we are not involved in editorial decision making and can only investigate programmes or take action against any channel after a programme's broadcast.'

Monty Python's Flying Circus was made for TV between 1969 and 1974 and generations of fans can recite lines and whole sketches.

The comedy troupe also made a string of hit films including Life Of Brian and The Meaning of Life.

Sixth Python Graham Chapman died of cancer in 1989, aged 48.
