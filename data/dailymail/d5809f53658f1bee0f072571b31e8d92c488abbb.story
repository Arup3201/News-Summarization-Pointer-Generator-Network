A proud homeowner was left terrified after taking a photo of her new house only to notice a ghost staring out from the window.

Michelle Midwinter, 30, had gone outside to take a picture of her new home in North Bradley, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to share with friends on her Facebook page.

But it was only when she took another look at the image that she noticed the spooky apparition of a man peering out her window.

The mother-of-one, who was at home with her two-year-old daughter, ran inside to discover that no one was there.

Miss Midwinter, who moved into the house last month, believes the sighting could be the spirit of Samuel Kent - a former factory inspector who worked in the area.

She said: 'I decided to take a picture of the front of our house and post it on Facebook to show how well we were all settling in.

'I went outside and took a picture but after initially admiring the brickwork the face just sort of jumped out at me.

'I ran into the house to make sure no one was in there because I knew everyone else was at work, but it was just me and my two-year-old daughter.

'I studied the photo for a while and then put it on Facebook to see if anyone else could come up with an explanation as to how the face could have got there.'

Miss Midwinter, a mobile phone case designer, added: 'The photo caused quite a stir on Facebook, but no one could really come up with any plausible explanation.

'Most people thought it was a reflection of the flowers below the window but the angles are all wrong.'

'It's hard to believe but it clearly looks like the face of an old man.'

She denies claims the image has been doctored and after witnessing a number of ghostly goings on - including a clock falling off a wall - believes the house is haunted.

'I'm a self-confessed non-believer of ghosts but the picture coupled with a clock randomly falling off the wall and smashing to pieces that morning did creep me out,' she said.

'The clock was there when we moved in, so it hadn't fallen off due to a dodgy fixture we had put up.

'Another weird thing was that my friend saw a door handle move down and the door opened in the same room the face in the window was in.

'I was just so surprised because I thought someone was in the house. We also checked the attic to make sure no one was living up there.

'I can't really say what I think the face in the window is as I honestly don't know.

'I would like to say an odd reflection but it doesn't make sense, I am a very logical person but I cannot come up with a logical explanation for this photo, it's just spooky.

'And to be honest, I would rather not think about it as we already hear strange scratches in the walls, noises from upstairs and the lights flicker on and off to.

'You end up scaring yourself if you think about it too much.'

Local historian Andrew Jones, 50, has done extensive research into Samuel Kent, the father of Constance Kent, who brutally murdered her three-year-old brother when she was 16 in the nearby village of Rode in 1860.

He thinks the photograph of the shadowy ghoul, dubbed Old Man Kent, bears a striking resemblance to Samuel Kent, who died in 1872.

Mr Jones, who is a caretaker at John of Gaunt School in Trowbridge, said: 'From looking at the photograph, to me it looks like Samuel Kent, father of Constance Kent, who committed an infamous murder in the area.

'There are a number of reported ghost sightings in Trowbridge but I have not come across any in North Bradley.

'I know Samuel lived and worked as a factory inspector in the area, so there's every chance it could be him.'

Mr Kent was originally a suspect in the 1860 Rode Hill House murder, but his daughter, Constance, was arrested and eventually convicted of murdering his three-year-old son.

The Rode Hill House murder case found fame again in recent years thanks to Kate Summerscale's award-winning book The Suspicions of Mr Whicher.

The sighting comes after a spate of reports that ghosts have been popping up in photographs across the nation, most recently at Cannock Chase in the Midlands, where a black-eyed ghost child was caught on camera.
