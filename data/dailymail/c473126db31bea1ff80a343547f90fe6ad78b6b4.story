Within hours of the fatal fire, the behaviour of Mick and Mairead Philpott was already arousing the suspicions of the police.

The couple were keen to ‘get rich quick’ off the back of the children’s deaths, receiving at least £3,100 directly in cash gifts which they used to buy new sportswear and to get drunk at parties.

Mick Philpott remained shameless to the last - and he was still smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children.

Philpott appeared to revel in the 'celebrity' of being the father of six dead youngsters and dabbed away non-existent tears at a press conference

Together with his wife Mairead and friend
 Paul Mosley, he had plotted to set fire to the family home in an 
appalling attempt to frame Philpott's former live-in lover Lisa Willis.

Today the trio face sentencing for their deadly actions.

Far from being an anguished father, Mick's inappropriate actions in the aftermath of the blaze made investigators suspicious.

The pattern of extraordinary behaviour also saw Philpott:

■ Fake a collapse and joke around in a hospital mortuary

■
 Sing the 1975 Elvis Presley songs Suspicious Minds and My Boy on a pub 
karaoke machine and proposition a female police officer during a 
‘jovial’ visit to a hospital when he called his children ‘little sh***’

■ Appear at a barbecue where his drunken wife showed off a new pair of £80 pink trainers.

■
 Become ‘fixated’ with creaming off the remainder of a fund to cover the
 children’s funeral costs and convert it into Argos vouchers.

■
 Tell fundraisers to collect and sell teddy bears which had been left 
outside the burned family home, ordering one wellwisher: ‘Shut up and 
just get on with it.’

■ Play the entire second half of a charity football match staged to raise funds for the family.

Philpott called his children 'little sh***' during a 'jovial' visit to hospital

Prosecutors wanted to tell jurors 
about Philpott’s private thirst to ‘spend’ the cash or ‘get rich quick’ 
from it, arguing he had been presenting  a ‘very different public 
face’.  But the evidence was ruled inadmissible.

The deadly gamble was to save the six 
youngsters, blame Miss Willis, and win back custody of five children who
 had recently moved out of the cramped three-bedroom semi with her.

Yesterday Mick, Mairead and Mosley were found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court.

The former live-in lover who Mick Philpott tried to frame for the 
fatal fire in a bitter custody battle is 'happy for the first time in 
years', it was revealed today.

Lisa Willis, who had five children with the killer, left the house 
she shared with him and his wife Mairead in a bizarre love triangle in 
February last year.

But when took the children with her, Philpott hatched a despicable plot to start a fire at his house and blame her.

She was arrested the day after the blaze which killed six of his other children, but was released within hours.

A source told The Sun: 'She has escaped the nightmare that was living with Philpott and Mairead.

'She is now a new woman, happy for the first time in years.'

Assistant
 Chief Constable Steve Cotterill, of Derbyshire Police, said after 
yesterday's verdict: 'We decided at a very early stage Lisa Willis was 
not involved.' 

Philpott, 56, shouted obscenities before saying ‘it’s not over yet’ moments after Mrs Justice Thirlwall asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘out of respect for the memories’ of the children he had killed.

But with typical arrogance, Philpott, who infamously appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to demand a bigger council house, crossed himself, waved and smiled as he was led away.

On May 11 last year, after Philpott had a sordid sex session with his wife and Mosley on their home snooker table, the fire was lit, with the intention that the six children sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window, with Philpott both ‘the hero and the victim’.

But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong. Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, all died of smoke inhalation.

Detectives
 started to take a firm interest in Mick soon as they began receiving witness
 statements which cast doubt on Philpott’s claim to have made repeated 
attempts to reach his children.

While some heroic and soot-covered neighbours needed medical attention 
following their attempts to reach the six trapped children, Philpott 
appeared ‘spotlessly clean’.

He
 was spotted wandering off from his 32-year-old wife and other relatives
 at the Royal Derby Hospital for a 30-minute discussion with his friend Mosley.

He even had to
 be persuaded by police to travel with his dying stepson Duwayne, 13, 
when it was decided to transfer the teenager to Birmingham Children’s 
Hospital.

He died there three days later. Duwayne’s
 godmother Jeannie Donnan said that in the hospital canteen ‘they would 
all sit quiet and then all of a sudden they’d all start a food fight and
 I was like, how can you have a food fight? You have just lost six kids …
 I was just sitting there thinking “no, this is not right”.’

By the time of a press conference five days after the blaze, he and his wife were already under deep suspicion. 

Philpott
 called the conference himself, ostensibly to thank the emergency 
services for their efforts to save his children. He appeared to be 
revelling in the ‘celebrity’ of being the father of six dead youngsters.

During the trial, the court heard how Philpott lived with 
his wife, Miss Willis and their combined 11 children in his cramped 
three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby.

But he was left irate after Miss Willis, 29, became disillusioned with his ‘domineering behaviour’ and summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her five children early last year.

That decision to leave, taking with her more than £1,000 a month in benefit payments, was the ‘catalyst for everything that was to follow’.

Steve Cotterill, Derbyshire Assistant 
Chief Constable, compared Philpott’s demeanour to that of an ‘excited 
child’. Far from seeming nervous, Philpott chatted about his love of 
karaoke and singing Elvis songs.

Tragic end: Kind-hearted locals raised £15,000 for the funeral of Mick Philpott's six children (top row, l-r) Jayden, five, Jessie, six, Jack, eight, (bottom row, l-r) John, nine, Jade, 10, and Duwyane, 13

He
 dabbed imaginary tears from his eyes during the brief conference, then 
performed a fake collapse in a corridor seconds after being ushered off 
stage.

His wife said nothing throughout the event.

Just
 24 hours earlier, the couple made their first of three ‘circus-like’ 
visits to the mortuary, in which Philpott called his six dead children 
‘little sh***’, indulged in one-sided ‘horseplay’ with a police officer 
and asked for gin when he was offered water.

Yesterday Philpott’s sister, Dawn Bestwick, said his family believed ‘justice has been served’.

‘This past year has been a very difficult time for our family as we have had to come to terms with what Michael and Mairead and Paul Mosley have done,’ she said.

‘We can now attempt to move on and our six angels can rest in peace.’

Mrs Philpott’s family said the children had been taken away in the ‘cruellest way imaginable by the very people who were supposed to love and protect them.’

Her sister Bernadette, who was ejected from the courtroom, said she was convinced of the Philpotts’ guilt from the outset.
