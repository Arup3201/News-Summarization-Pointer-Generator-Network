A two-year-old boy has died from an E. coli infection that has inflicted at least 19 others after attending a North Carolina fair.

Two-year-old Gage Lefevers of Gaston County has been confirmed as the first fatality related to the outbreak that has so far sickened 14 children and six adults who attended the fair.

Officials have yet to declare the Cleveland County Fair as the source of the outbreak but all inflicted with the deadly bacteria are said to have attended the event between September 26 and October 7.

Tragedy: Two-year-old Gage Lefevers has been identified as the first fatality of a deadly E. coli outbreak connected to a North Carolina fair that has sickened at least 20

Deadly connection: All inflicted with the deadly bacteria attended the Cleveland County Fair between September 26 and October 7 but the site has yet to be declared the source

Victims: So far 14 children and six adults have fallen victim to the bacteria transferred from animal waste with the latest being five-year-old Hannah Roberts, pictured

'It saddens me for a little boy that young,’ Claudine Cobb, a secretary at the church Gage and his family attended told WSOC through tears. ‘But he's with Jesus now. I know where he's at.'

Gage died at Charlotte’s Levine Children Hospital on Friday afternoon.

He was one of six hospitalized with four said to currently have a life threatening strain of the bacteria that affects the kidneys.

Among the latest victims is five-year-old Hannah Roberts.

Jordan McNair, 12, who's currently hospitalized at Levine Children Hospital is one of three on kidney dialysis.

'The fair should have been a safer place,' Jordan's grandmother Bennie McClannon told WSOC.

Family said Jordan was doing much better on Thursday but that he's not out of the woods yet.

Critical condition: Jordan McNair, 12, who attended the fair and played in its petting zoo is currently one of three on dialysis after contracting a life-threatening strain of the bacteria

Hopeful end: Wednesday marked the end of the bacteria's incubation period making health officials believe they won't find any more cases of the bacteria unless spreading through outside contact

'It was rough,' his older sister Hayley Totherow told WBTV. 'Just hoping every morning that I would hear good news. And when I didn't hear that, it just scared me.'

She said Jordan had visited the fair's petting zoo where he milked a cow on September 30. He also ate two corn dogs.

The next day he began to feel sick in what doctors first thought to have been appendicitis.

The bacteria are found in the waste of animals, and people who touch contaminated material such as food or animals can transfer the bacteria to their mouths or to other people.

Cleveland County Fair director Calvin Hastings says the fair tried to prevent E. coli problems by adding hand-washing stations and moving food vendors farther away from animals.

Health officials say Wednesday marked the end of the bacteria's incubation period, 11 days after the fair ended prompting them to believe any new cases directly linked to the fair will not appear.

It can still spread through human contact, however.

‘In some cases in young children, this infection can lead to serious complications, so parents should not send sick children to day care or to school to avoid passing it on to others,’ State Health Director Laura Gerald, the State Laboratory for Public Health, told WBTV.
