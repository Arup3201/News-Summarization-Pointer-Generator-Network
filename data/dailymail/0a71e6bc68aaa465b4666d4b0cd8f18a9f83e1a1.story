The jubilant moment a relieved groom found his wedding ring after he lost it in a river has been captured on camera.

Richard Ford's cherished platinum band slipped off his finger while he was paddleboarding with a group of friends along the River Tame, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on July 14.

The 30-year-old, from Tamworth, who got married last August to primary school teacher Jen, also 30, only discovered the ring was missing when he had travelled half-a-mile down the river.

Yes! Richard Ford celebrates on hearing the news that his wedding ring has been found in the River Tame

Delighted: The groom can't believe his luck as he thought the ring was gone for good as it slipped off his finger when paddleboarding

Richard and his friends then spent 24 hours scouring the bottom of the river bed to try and find it.

Richard, a joiner, explained said: 'We were on the river when I realised it was missing. I was devastated - I'm not into jewellery, but it is so special to me, it felt like I had lost part of my soul.

'That afternoon three of us went out with snorkels and searched for hours and hours, but we couldn't find it.

'Someone had been taking photos and by 
checking them all, managed to pinpoint the area where I lost the ring, 
as in one shot I was wearing it and the next I wasn't.

Down there somewhere: The friends pinpointed roughly where the ring could be after looking back through their pictures of the trip

Search: Richard used a hollowed out bucket with a perspex bottom to look

Joker: Unbeknown to Richard, his friend, Neil, has found it and then asks him why he has his head in a bucket

Is this it? He then produces the ring and films his friend's delighted reaction

'So on the Monday night a group volunteered to help me look again. I was desperate to find it. I hollowed 
out a bucket and put perspex in the bottom of it and I lay face-first on
my paddleboard with a T-shirt around my head and my head in the bucket 
looking into the water.'

During the search, his friend Neil Myers, 30, found the ring under a rock and decided to film Richard's reaction to his discovery.

The footage - which has gone viral on YouTube with thousands of hits - shows Richard frantically searching for the ring by lying face-down on his paddleboard and using a hollowed out bucket to scour the riverbed.

Back where it belongs: He said he felt like part of his soul was missing when he was without it

Sentimental value: Richard and Jenny exchanged rings when they married last year

Neil can be heard saying: 'Rich, what is it you’re doing? Get your head out of the bucket.'

He than adds: 'What is it you’re looking for? Does it look like that?' as he then produces the ring to a stunned Richard.

The relieved husband leaps up from his paddleboard and throws his arms in the air shouting 'yes' in celebration as if he has just won a gold medal at the Olympics.

Ring in place: The couple on their wedding day

Under the sea: Richard and Jenny show off their rings when scuba diving on their honeymoon in Egypt- little did they know he would lose his underwater a year later

The 1.37 minute clip then shows Richard putting the ring back on his finger before hugging his friends and shaking their hands saying: 'Thank you, I'm indebted to you forever.'

Richard said of the find and his subsequent online fame: 'I couldn’t believe it, I really didn’t think I'd see it again, it was a million to one chance.

'The video is hilarious and I can't thank Neil enough or the other club members, they were great.'
