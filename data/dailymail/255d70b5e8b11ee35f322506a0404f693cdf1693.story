Luis Suarez has strenuously denied attempting to bite Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis and insists the British media should stop making trouble and show him more respect.

Social media was awash with suggestions that the Barcelona striker had tried to have a nibble on the former Bayern Munich defender during City's 2-1 Champions League defeat at the Etihad on Wednesday night.

Footage emerged of Demichelis pushing his arm out in Suarez's direction to fend off the forward who appeared to move his mouth towards the Argentine's arm.

Another video clip from another angle appeared to clear Suarez of any wrongdoing and the 28-year has moved to clear any remaining confusion over the incident.

'He [Demichelis] put his hand on my throat,' the Barcelona striker told Uruguayan radio station Sport890. 'I do not understand why they [the English media] want to do this. They want to make trouble - a mountain out of a molehill.'

'They must be hurt after what I did to them in the World Cup but they forget that I played in England and they should show me some respect.'

Suarez has three times served suspensions during his career for biting opponents, the latest of which - at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil when he sunk his teeth into Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini's neck - earned him a four-month ban.

Suarez's Barcelona career got off to a slow start after missing the first few months of the season, but the striker is beginning to hit top form again and netted twice on his return to England as Barcelona took a slender advantage into the last-16 second leg at the Nou Camp.
