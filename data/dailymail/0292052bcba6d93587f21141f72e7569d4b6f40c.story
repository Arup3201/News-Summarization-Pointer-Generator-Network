A nursing assistant has been suspended from a hospital for mentally ill young people over claims she sent a suicidal teenage patient instructions on how to kill herself.

Sharon Bradley is alleged to have sent the unnamed girl, a vulnerable in-patient at Skye House in the grounds of Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital, a picture on Instagram explaining how someone could take their life. 

The 49-year-old has been suspended while the NHS Trust carries out a high-level investigation.

She refused to comment on the case at her home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, according to the Daily Record.

She was working at Skye House, a facility for youngsters from the age of 12 to 17 with serious mental health problems.

A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde told MailOnline: 'This is a very serious allegation which is being investigated at the highest level within the organisation. 

'While this investigation is being carried out a member of staff has been suspended in line with our normal HR procedures.'

The rise of social media has a profound impact on the mental state of young people, according to experts, who attribute sites including Ask.fm as contributing to a rise in cyber-bullying. 

Abuse on the internet and through mobile phones is one of the key child protection issues facing young people, according to research by the NSPCC and ChildLine.

In 2013, 4,500 young people contacted ChildLine about online bullying in 2013.

The mental health charity Young Minds said bullying has become such a widespread issue affecting the lives of many children and young people across the UK, that almost half of children between 10 and 15 say they have been bullied at some point in their lives.
