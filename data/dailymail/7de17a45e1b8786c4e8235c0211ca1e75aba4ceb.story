Nasa has revealed new pictures of Curiosity 'looking back' at one of its cameras on the martian surface.

It comes as they confirmed the rover has now tested its robotic arm successfully, using a 1909 penny and a piece of rock from New Mexico to calibrate its instruments.

The team admitted even they were surprised by the quality of images being sent back after dust covers were removed from the rover's main cameras.

Nasa today released this incredible image of Curiosity on the red planet, showing off its wheels and four 'navcams' which act as the rover's eyes on the red planet.

'Wow, seeing these images after all the tremendous hard work that has 
gone into making them possible is a profoundly emotional moment,' said 
MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems, 
San Diego.

'It is so exciting to see the camera returning beautiful, 
sharp images from Mars.'

NASA's Mars rover Curiosity stepped 
through activities on Sept. 7, 8 and 9 designed to check and 
characterize precision movements by the rover's robotic arm and use of 
tools on the arm.

The activities confirmed good health and usefulness of Mars Hand Lens 
Imager, or MAHLI, and used that camera to check arm placement during 
several positioning activities.

MAHLI took an image with its reclosable dust cover open for the first 
time on Mars, confirming sharp imaging capability that had been obscured
by a thin film of dust on the cover during previous use of the camera.

It took images of cameras at the top of Curiosity's mast, of the 
underbelly of the rover and of MAHLI's own calibration target, among 
other pointings.

The camera's calibration target includes a 1909 Lincoln penny that 
Edgett purchased for this purpose.

The team calibrated the camera using a 'lucky penny' on the rover's mast

'We're seeing the penny in the 
foreground and, looking past it, a setting I'm sure the people who 
minted these coins never imagined,' Edgett said.

The penny is a nod to geologists' tradition of placing a coin or other 
object of known scale as a size reference in close-up photographs of 
rocks, and it gives the public a familiar object for perceiving size 
easily when it will be viewed by MAHLI on Mars.

'The folks who drive the rover's arm and turret have taken a 220-pound 
arm through some very complex tai chi, to center a penny in an image 
that's only a few centimeters across,' said MAHLI Deputy Principal 
Investigator Aileen Yingst of the Tucson-based Planetary Science 
Institute.

'They make the impossible look easy.'

The arm characterization activities, including more imaging by MAHLI, 
will continue for a few days before Curiosity resumes driving toward a 
mid-term science destination area called Glenelg.

In that area, the 
rover may use its scoop to collect a soil sample, and later its drill to
collect a sample of powder from inside a rock.

Curiosity is five weeks into a two-year prime mission on Mars.

It will 
use 10 science instruments to assess whether the selected study area 
ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

A sample of basaltic rock from a lava flow in New Mexico serves as a calibration target for the rover's Canadian-made Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer

Nasa today revealed stunning new images of Curiosity's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution Mahli camera, which had its dustcover removed for the first time

Wheels down: Nasa used the newly uncovered Mahli camera to take a series of images of the rover's wheel on the red planet's surface

The new images also give tantalising views of the nearby mountains that Curiosity will eventually climb in its quest for for ingredients of life on the red planet

The images also reveal Curiosity's large wheels and distinctive tyre tracks, which leave morse code messages on the surface as it travels
