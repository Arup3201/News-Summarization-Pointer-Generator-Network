It has been billed as the Greatest Show on Earth and the audience inside the Olympic Stadium were treated to a high-tech extravaganza.

Organisers had installed 70,799 tiny panels between the spectators’ seats, which produced  amazingly complex images and visual effects.

Audience members at the Olympic Stadium 
in East London were all handed 3D glasses as well.

New look: Three young people in the crowd try out their 3D glasses at the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium

Trying it out: Acting Indian Olympic Association President Vijay Kumar Malhotra (right) and guest Gurmit Singh of India try on their glasses as they sit in the VIP box

British weather: As the rain began spectators covered the heads with make-shift covers

But apparently the 3D glasses were just a novelty prop and were not actually necessary for the audience.

Hundreds of people in the audience took to their Twitter pages to express their amusement.

User Stephen Hul tweeted: 'I've had some
odd nights out, but sitting in this stadium with sheep, cows, geese and
3D glasses is the best natural high I've ever had.'

Another user Luke Dufficy wrote: 'We have been given 3D glasses...interested to see what it's for!'

Christina Brown ‏tweeted '3D glasses on. Hope this is going to be amazing.'

Worldwide event: As ticketholders took to their seats inside the Stadium, they were greeted by the sight of the imposing Olympic Bell and England's 'Green and Pleasant Land'

Build up: Actors take their places before the start of the extravagant ceremony

Famous faces: Inside the stadium will be hundreds of high-profile guests including Michelle Obama, David Cameron and The Royal Family, as well as hundreds of foreign officials and celebrities

Anticipation: Thousands of spectators took to their seats to watch the spectacular show

Inside the stadium will be hundreds of 
high-profile guests who could be wearing the glasses include Michelle 
Obama, David Cameron and the Royal Family, as well as hundreds of 
foreign officials and celebrities.

As ticketholders took to their seats 
inside the Stadium, they were greeted by the sight of the imposing 
Olympic Bell and England's 'Green and Pleasant Land' a giant countryside
landscape occupying the centre of the Olympic arena.

As performers prepared for the 
ceremony,  the red Arrows flew overhead from east to west, leaving a 
spectacular trail of red, white and blue vapour.

The sound of the jet's engines was dwarfed by the cheers of the baying crowd below.
