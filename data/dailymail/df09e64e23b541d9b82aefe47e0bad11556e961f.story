At least 14 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded after a powerful car bomb ripped through a southern suburb of the capital of Lebanon.

Dozens of others were trapped in burning cars and buildings following the blast in Beirut. The violence is being linked to the conflict in neighbouring Syria, officials have said.

The blast was the second such explosion in just over a month in southern Beirut, which is an overwhelmingly Shia area controlled by Hezbollah.

It is the deadliest attack in decades against the neighbourhoods which are considered bastions of support for Hezbollah.

Groups opposed to Syria's President Bashar Assad have threatened to retaliate against Hezbollah for intervening on behalf of his regime in the conflict.

Lebanese TV showed raging fires and thick black smoke from the blast, which set cars and buildings on fire.

The state-run National News Agency said at least 14 died and 212 were wounded.

The army, in a statement, said the explosion was caused by a car blast. It called on residents to cooperate with security forces trying to evacuate people trapped in their homes.

The explosion occurred on a commercial and residential street in the Rweiss district, close to the Sayyed al-Shuhada complex where Hezbollah holds rallies.

Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has lived in hiding since his group's 2006 month-long war with Israel, made a rare public appearance at the complex on August 2, where he addressed hundreds of supporters.

A car bomb exploded in the nearby Beir al-Abed district last month, wounding more than 50 people.

Today's attack was the worst explosion in southern Beirut since a 1985 truck bomb assassination attempt targeting top Shia cleric Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah. That blast in Beir al-Abed left 80 people dead.

An Associated Press photographer saw at least two bodies and many wounded people at the scene of the explosion today. Panicked Hezbollah fighters fired in the air to clear the area.

Sunni-Shia tensions have risen sharply in Lebanon, particularly since Hezbollah raised its profile by openly fighting alongside Assad's forces.

Lebanese Sunnis support the rebels fighting to topple Assad, a member of a Shia offshoot sect.

Syria-based rebels and militant Islamist groups have threatened to target Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for its increasingly overt role in Syria. The group's fighters played a key role in a recent regime victory in the town of Qusair near the Lebanese border, and Syrian activists say they are now aiding a regime offensive in the besieged city of Homs.

Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Ammar called it a 'terrorist' attack and called for restraint among the group's supporters. He suggested the group's political rivals in Lebanon were responsible for creating an atmosphere that encouraged such attacks.

Lebanon is sharply split along sectarian lines and among supporters and opponents of Assad's regime. Politicians within Lebanon's Western-backed coalition have slammed the group for its involvement in Syria and called for its disarmament.
