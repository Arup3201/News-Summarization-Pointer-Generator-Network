These shocking pictures show the horrible fate suffered by a greyhound which fell foul of the brutal Spanish hunting industry.

Prince was found starving and near death in a government-run pound after being discarded by his owner at the end of the hunting season.

But a British sanctuary owner managed to nurse him back to health - and is now trying to extend the same treatment to the other animals caught up in the cruel trade.

Danger: Prince the greyhound was close to death when he was rescued by an animal sanctuary

Ill: The dog had to be nursed back to health due to his poor physical condition

Compassion: Sanctuary owner Charlotte del Rio with Prince

Greyhounds, known as 'galgos', are used in Spain for hunting, but when the end of the season comes around their owners often decide they have no further need for them.

Campaigners believe that more than 50,000 dogs die or are abandoned each year thanks to the hunting industry.

Some are left to wander the landscape on their own, often starving to death or being killed in car accidents.

Others end up in government pounds, where they are given just a few weeks to find a new home before they are put down, and the dogs must fight each other for the food they are given.

In some cases, hunters who are angry with their poorly performing dogs torture them by breaking their legs, hanging them from trees or throwing them down wells.

While Prince was not quite so unfortunate, he was in a very sorry state when Charlotte del Rio, a British expat who runs a sanctuary in Malaga, took him home from a pound.

The magnificent animal was so emaciated his spine was jutting through his skin, and he was not expected to survive the night.

But Ms del Rio's loving care helped Prince regain his strength, and within a couple of days he was wagging his tail again.

The dog has now gained 2kg of weight, and the sanctuary is hoping to find him a permanent home in the near future.

Grisly: Prince was so badly malnourished that his spine was jutting out of his pelt

Prince's story has been highlighted by Martin Usborne, a photographer from London who is spending this year trying to save as many animals from torment as possible.

He raised £2,000 for Prince's care by selling photographs of the beautiful dog, and hopes to help many more through his work.

The urgency of efforts to help animals has been exacerbated by the recession, according to Mr Usborne, who says that sanctuaries in Spain have seen record numbers of cases this year.
