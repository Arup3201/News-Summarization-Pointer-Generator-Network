Tony Abbott, Barack Obama and Shinzo Abe have kicked off trilateral talks on the sidelines of the G20 in Brisbane on Sunday morning.

Stronger defence ties were the agenda when the three leaders sat down for what is only the second ever leader-level trilateral dialogue between Australia, the United States and Japan.

The first involved Mr Abe, John Howard and George W Bush in September 2007 on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Sydney.

The trio also recommitted to degrading and ultimately defeating the threat of Islamic State extremists and countering the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters, as well as tackling Ebola 

'They resolved to tackle pressing issues such as ... opposing Russia's purported annexation of Crimea and its actions to destabilise eastern Ukraine, and bringing to justice those responsible for the downing of flight MH17,' according to a statement.

Russia has denied involvement in escalating military activity in Ukraine.

But Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the 'very best intelligence sources' showed the surface-to-air missile that shot down MH17 was 'brought in from Russia'.

'President Putin is clearly seeking to demonstrate that Russia is still a power to be reckoned with,' she said.

'If it wants to be taken seriously, and if it wants to maintain its status as a significant economy, a significant nation, then it has to abide by the international norms.'

During Sunday's meeting, the three leaders recommitted to degrading and ultimately defeating the threat of Islamic State extremists and countering the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters, as well as tackling Ebola.

They also discussed eliminating the North Korean nuclear and missile threat and its addressing human rights issues.

There was also talk about the peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in Asian waters.

'The leaders expressed their firm commitment to deepen the already strong security and defence cooperation among the three countries and to strengthen the collective ability to address global concerns and promote regional stability,' the statement said.

US, Australia and Japan will hold trilateral military exercises in Australia and work more closely on maritime security.

Cooperation will also be expanded in the areas of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and tackling cyber warfare.

Australia's intent to replace the Collins Class submarine fleet is also understood to have been discussed.

Japan is considered a potential supplier of the submarines, although no final decision has been made.
