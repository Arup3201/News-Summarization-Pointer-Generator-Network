The grief stricken father of three young girls who died in tragic fire at their mother's Connecticut mansion on Christmas Day 2011 has revealed the true depth of his pain.

Devastated Matthew Badger, 47, appeared on Katie Couric's afternoon talk show on Tuesday and opened up about his suicidal feelings the moment he learned of his little girl's deaths.

In an emotional interview, Badger spoke of how he has been coping since the accident and how he is looking to honor the memory of Lily, nine, and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah who perished in the blaze at the $1.7 million home.

A still distraught Matthew Badger tells Katie Couric that he has had suicidal thoughts following the deaths of Lily, nine, and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah

'I kept thinking, this is a nightmare,' he said, explaining how he felt after being informed of the shocking news by a policeman who came to his door on Christmas morning.

'When you are in this state you want to kill yourself, it’s absolutely natural. If your child dies on you, there is a feeling you want to go and parent them.'

'I wanted to go and be a parent to my girls wherever they went. I want to talk about the extreme emotion — you’re suicidal, you’re rageful, you just want to vanish.'

During the difficult interview, Badger chocked back tears as he had to explain that despite the fire being attributed to a his ex-wife Madonna Badger and her contractor boyfriend Michael Borcina after Mr Borcina placed ashes in a paper bag in a plastic container - he held no malice.

'Those girls, our girls, loved her,' he said to Katie. 'I will honor my girls and that is what I’m doing with my life right now. Standing up for my girls and making their lives matter. I will never say anything bad about Madonna,' said Badger on the Katie afternoon show.

Adding to his emotional testimony in front of Katie Couric's studio audience, Badger spoke lovingly and candidly of his memories of his daughters.

'Lily was the oldest and she had a personality that was very difficult to actually know who you were sitting with. She had a natural ability to be an actress,' said Badger.

'Sarah had this amazingly sunny disposition and she absolutely adored people, she was curious about everybody, she was a complete socialite.

'Gracie on the other hand had the exact opposite disposition. She was miserable. She arrived crying and she didn't stop crying for a year. And her crying was just amazing. Because she had this scream that would just terrorise everybody.

He also spoke about how he has channeled his grief into his Lily Sarah Grace Fund which is designed to help back promotion of the arts in public schools.

'Well I knew that there were these cutbacks on public education and public schools and that they were being challenged incredibly to be able to bring art back into the schools. And in a lot of the cases they had to get rid of the art teacher,' said Badger.

'And I also knew that art was considered a non essential subject, so from my own experience of what my girls went through that sounded like a terrible thing.'

This comes just over a month on from an interview that Badger gave to the New York Magazine in which he admitted contemplating killing his ex-wife Madonna Badger and her contractor boyfriend Michael Borcina, who he blamed for the deaths of Lily, nine, and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah.

His former wife's parents Lomer Johnson, 71, and his wife Pauline, 69, also perished in the blaze.

Mr Badger, who lives in Manhattan, told New York magazine he was still tormented by the deaths of his children.

He has yet to return to his job as a commercial director and went on a pilgrimage to India in October with his girlfriend where he met the Dalai Lama and cried.

Afterwards, he spread some of the girls' ashes on a hill.

'Three white dogs came suddenly to sit with [us], beautiful, not mangy,' he told the magazine.

Mr Badger, who wears necklace of Tibetan prayer flags, has not forgiven the man he believes responsible for the inferno which claimed five lives.

He described meeting Mr Borcina in the street and refusing to hug him.

After last year’s accident Mr Badger founded the Lily-Sarah-Grace Fund to support low-income schools with arts grant funding.

Pain: In a heartbreaking interview last year, Madonna Badger, who lost her three children and parents in a house fire on Christmas Day, said she considered taking out the deadly ashes - but went to bed

Tears: She also recalled trying to save her daughters from the flames - and how doctors told her of their deaths

Earlier this year Mrs Badger said the paper bag of ashes did not seem dangerous as her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, had ran his hands through them.

He then placed them on top of a plastic bin in a mudroom, which caught her eye as she walked up the stairs in the early hours of Christmas morning.

'I remember thinking to myself, "I should put that outside. I should put that outside",' Mrs Badger told the Today show. 'Then I remembered thinking, "No, but I watched him put his hands through it".'

An hour later, she woke up choking on smoke but did not hear fire alarms sounding, despite her belief that the home, which was undergoing renovation, was installed with smoke detectors.

'It was silent,' she said. 'It was the scariest silence.'

She climbed out of bed and crawled to the bedroom window, hoisting herself down to the floor below as she struggled to breathe.

As she looked through windows, she realised she had a horrifying decision to make.

'The windows were my mom and dad's windows,' she said. 'So I had to decide, "Do I go in and save them? Or do I go save my children?" And so I ran the other way to save my children.'

She ran to the side of the house and climbed up scafolding to get to her daughter Grace's room.

'I opened that window and the smoke that hit me, it was just the blackest, like an ocean,' she recalled, sobbing. 'There was twirling and there was embers and all kinds of stuff in it.

'I kept trying to hold my breath and put my head in. And I couldn't get in.'

Adding that she couldn't see any of the girls inside, she said: 'I'm just screaming for somebody to help me. It was the blackest smoke I've ever seen. If I could have seen them, I would have gone in.

'It's impossible to describe how it is that you can't go in and save your own children, but I couldn't get through that smoke. I couldn't.'

She saw Borcina, whose eyes had burned shut, running around the yard yelling for the girls and telling them to jump to him from upper floors.

She said firefighters dragged her away from the home for her safety as she howled out for her girls.

'They said I had to go right away and I begged them and begged them,' she said. 'I'm yelling at them, "Where are my kids? Where are my babies?"'

Wiping away her tears, she went on: 'Then somebody said, "Turn off the radios! Turn off the radios!" and then I knew that they must have - I don't know what happened. Something really bad.'

Badger was taken to hospital where it took three hours for a doctor to tell her that her children had died and her parents probably would not survive.

'I said, "Bring everybody. The children are gone, my mum and dad are gone. There's been a fire. Please come and help me". I was just so scared,' she said.

Earlier this year Mr Badger, spoke to People magazine about the moment was told of their deaths on the phone.

'It ended my life,' he said. 'I'm a father, I'm a father. I [messed] up. I wasn't there to save them.'

He said that he is overcome with grief each day and the foundation is his salvation.

'If I don't cry every day, the waves are bigger,' he said. 'If I cry every day, it is less dramatic. I don't think the loss is ever going away.'
