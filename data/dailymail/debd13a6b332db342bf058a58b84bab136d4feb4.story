French truckers are threatening to blockade the port of Calais in protest at steep fines imposed for British-bound migrants found hiding in their lorries.

Haulage firms are fined £2,000 for each illegal immigrant they bring across the Channel from France.

Drivers complain that lax border controls in Calais allow stowaways to climb into their vehicles and sneak into Britain.

Penalty protest: French truckers could be set to copy British counterparts who organised a demonstration in Dover a week ago, above, claiming they were being wrongly punished for a lack of proper border controls

And the harsh penalties imposed if they are caught is driving some firms to bankruptcy.

Hundreds of truckers staged a mass protest in Dover a week ago claiming they were being unfairly punished for the lack of proper checks across the Channel.

David Sagnard, president of France's National Road Haulage Federation, said: 'We have reached the point of no return.

'Many firms can not afford these hefty fines if they are caught in Britain, and some are going bust.

'If those in charge do not act now to resolve this issue, we plan a blockade.'

Lorry drivers are now forbidden from parking overnight within 100 miles of Calais in case immigrants sneak aboard.

But many climb into lorries at service stations near the port, or break into the secure truck parking area at the ferry terminal.

Truckers and their supporters gathered in Dover last week to complain about the financial penalties imposed on hauliers who are found with illegal migrants in their vehicles

Two weeks ago, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12 million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel.

The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile-long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the ferry terminal.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart also recently threatened to blockade the ferry port unless Britain did more to help her town tackle the crisis.

Ms Bouchart also wants the UK border to be moved from Calais to Britain, and for Prime Minister David Cameron to visit her town.

She recently blamed the UK's 'generous' state benefits for refugees for the squalid migrant camps in her town.

She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That's enough. It's no longer tenable. It's necessary to renegotiate these accords. We're not here to do their job.'

There are an estimated 2,000 migrants in Calais, where tensions have been mounting in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood into the town.

Mass brawls between rival gangs have left more than 70 people injured during July and August.

Many refugees are now taking increasingly dangerous risks to sneak into the UK.

Last month two migrants were plucked to safety from the English Channel after trying to climb aboard a moving ferry off Calais.

Migrants have also risked their lives by smuggling themselves into refrigerated lorries, clinging to the axles of HGVs and even aboard a cargo of coffins.
