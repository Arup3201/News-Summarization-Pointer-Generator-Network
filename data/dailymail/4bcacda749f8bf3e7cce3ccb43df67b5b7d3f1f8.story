'A significant risk to the public': Andrew Cumming, 30, from Hull, has been jailed for 13 years after attacking pensioners

A man who launched violent and unprovoked attacks on defenceless pensioners has been imprisoned for 13 years.

Andrew Cumming, 30, from Hull, beat one woman in her 80s unconscious and broke another elderly man's jaw, cheekbone and eye socket, Hull Crown Court heard.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told Cumming he posed a 'significant and enduring risk to the public' and said he had considered jailing him for life, but was not allowed to by current law.

He said: 'Your conduct almost defies belief. You deserve severe punishment and that is what you will get.

'You told a man you wanted to rip off "coffin-dodgers". That vile remark reveals your cruel, callous and predatory character.

'You have preyed upon the elderly and vulnerable with a vicious determination.'

The court heard that Cumming, who has 78 previous convictions, many of them against the elderly, robbed an 82-year-old woman in her home in Nidderdale, east Hull, after knocking on her door complaining he had glass in his eye one day last September.

When she opened her door to help him, he burst in and grabbed her, dragging her from room to room and destroying her treasured photographs.

He left her unconscious on her bedroom floor before stealing £853 and her handbag.

She told police how she tried to fight him off but he was too strong.

Judge Richardson said: 'Out of compassion, she opened the door. You then saw your chance and seized it.

'You
 left her injured and terrified. Having regard to your appalling history
 of targeting the elderly, this is a particularly serious crime and you 
deserve a long jail sentence.'

Sentencing Cumming at Hull Crown Court, the judge said he had 'an appalling history of targeting the elderly'

Cumming also set upon a couple and their friend out walking their dogs in the Yorkshire countryside.

He punched a 74-year-old man four times in the face as he lay on the ground, leaving his cheekbone, jaw and eye socket broken.

The man needed surgery to insert metal plates into his face following the assault in August last year.

Police described the attack on the man as 'vicious and sustained', lasting up to quarter of an hour.

Cumming also punched the man's wife in the face when she tried to help her husband, and snatched a mobile telephone from her friend’s hand when she tried to call police.

Judge Richardson said: 'This was serious violent conduct towards senior citizens.'

Cumming attacked them after accusing the woman of failing to clear up after her dog.

He was also sentenced for trying to defraud two elderly sisters in the Yorkshire village of Cottingham out of more than £3,000 for garden work he had not carried out.

Cumming admitted robbery, wounding and two charges of fraud.

Jailing him for 13 years, Judge Richardson said: 'You are an habitual criminal of a predatory kind.

'You target elderly victims who are particularly vulnerable, which is part of your malevolent character.

'I have seriously considered imposing a life sentence, but I would not be justified in so doing under the current law. However, you will be severely punished.

'You pose a significant and enduring risk to the public, particularly elderly citizens.'

Cumming was also given an extended licence period of a further five years.
