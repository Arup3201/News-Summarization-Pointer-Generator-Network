Once-pristine lakes in Ontario, Canada, are now coated by a jello-like layer of slime caused by decades of industrial activity, a new study reveals.

The scum coating now present on vast bodies of water in the province is due to the rapid growth of a new type of plankton which secretes the unpleasant goo, according to a team of researchers.

Years of industrial activity has eaten away at nutrients around the lakes, killing off species that used to live there and allowing the Holopedium gibberum plankton to thrive.

After-effects: A decline in calcium, caused by effects like acid rain, killed off competitors and allowed the scum-producing Holopedium gibberum to expand

Researchers - who pictured themselves scooping gelatinous handfuls of the scum out of the lakes - said they found calcium levels in the earth by the lakes had plummeted in recent decades.

Chemical waste from factories - spread by weather phenomena like acid rain - can eat away at minerals usually present in soil, causing profound changes to the animals and plants that live nearby.

According to the researchers - a mixture of government scientists and academics from the universities of Cambridge and Ottawa - populations of the plankton which produce the substance has doubled since the 1980s.

It has corresponded with a decline in the calcium levels in surrounding soil, which began with the rise of industry in the 1850s, but picked up significantly in the late 20th Century.

Their findings were published this month in a journal by the Royal Society, which said the effect could take thousands of years to reverse.

The lakes used to be full of a different species of plankton - called Daphnia - which had lived there for centuries and thrived on the calcium which made its way into the water from surrounding soil.

The tiny animal needed the calcium to build a thick exo-skeleton that stopped it from getting eaten by midges - but when the deposits started to run out they struggled to survive.

While populations declined, the Holopedium gibberum - which doesn't need as much calcium - began to thrive instead.

Their defensive mechanism is to surround themselves with a jello-like scum, which is now spreading over the lake.

As well as contributing to the 'jellification' effect, falling calcium levels could have a knock-on effect on public health, as these nutrients can make their way up the food chain into humans. The water could also become less safe to use.

Dr Andrew Tanentzap, a Cambridge University plant scientist, said: 'As calcium declines, the increasing concentrations of jelly in the middle of these lakes will reduce energy and nutrient transport right across the food chain, and will likely impede the withdrawal of lake water for residential, municipal and industrial uses.'

'In Ontario, 20% of government-monitored drinking water systems now come from landscapes containing lakes with depleted calcium concentrations that favour, and this is only set to increase.'

Environment laws have stopped many of the processes which led to the removal of calcium, but the slow-moving effects are still being felt, and could prove difficult to shift.

 Tanentzap said: 'Pollution control may have stopped acid deposits in the landscape, but it’s only now that we are discovering the damage wasn’t entirely reversed'.

'It may take thousands of years to return to historic lake water calcium concentrations solely from natural weathering of surrounding watersheds'.
