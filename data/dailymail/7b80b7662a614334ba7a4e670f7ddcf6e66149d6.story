A father is finally welcoming all four of his newborn quadruplets home - but sadly not his wife.

Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona had two of the babies home with him, and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital this week.

This after the babies were born premature and, in a tragic twist, his wife Erica, 36, passed away just one day after giving birth.

The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family.

But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital.

Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, finally has his newborn quadruplets home with him

Tragic: Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 16. Their mother would never get to meet them

'Look at these beautiful blessings,' Morales told People. 

'Even when they scream their heads off I want to give them the biggest kiss.'

He then added; 'I already know their quirky little habits or the next time they're going to cry. They're starting to form their own personalities.'

And while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two, he does have help thanks to his wife's mother-in-law, who moved down to help with the children. 

The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss.

Just an hour later she died, and never got to hold them in her arms.

Since then Mr Morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through.

'We were so excited to start our family,' he told People magazine, 'And then it all came crashing down.'

In the heartbreaking interview, he also described the moment the pair first met.  

'I didn't speak any English and she didn't speak any Spanish,', laughing. 'But I asked her to dance and she said yes.' 

He then gave her his phone number, only to discover she had thrown the piece of paper out.

Loving father: The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock. She died an hour later 

However they met each other through friends again and sparked a relationship. 

After marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, Mr Morales said they started trying for a baby right away.

They went through a miscarriage, but were ecstatic when they found out the had a baby (before they realized it was mutiple) on the way. 

He told the magazine: 'Her doctor told her she had to just relax. So that's exactly what she did.' 

In a bid to prevent her from any undue stress, Mr Morales cooked, cleaned and made sure his wife stayed off her feet. 

She had been healthy throughout the pregnancy, but was admitted into hospital on January 12 because her blood pressure was high.

Three days later, she texted her husband at his construction job and said doctors wanted to deliver right away. 

Bond: The pair got married in 2007 and tried for a baby straight away. After a miscarriage they opted for IVF. Mr Morales said 'We were so excited to start our family. And then it all came crashing down.'

'The doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies,' he said: 'We took pictures before she went into the delivery room, made some videos, and she was surrounded by family and friends. I said to her, 'Let's get these babies out'.' 

They began discussing names, but Mrs Morales said the pair could decide after they were born. 

After the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery, Mr Morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up.

A short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off. The next thing Mr Morales was told is that his wife was dead.

Describing what happened to People, he said: 'How could this have happened? She was fine, and then she wasn't. She was alive and then she was just gone.

'I went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life.'

The nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. The nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - Erica. 

Heartbreaking: Mr Morales and his wife (pictured during pregnancy) started discussing names before she went into labor. She then told they would decide after they were born 

During his visits he is taking classes to make sure he gives his children the best care possible.

He told the magazine 'I'm learning everything from how to give them a bath, CPR, feeding, and how to manage their sleep schedule. I need to be prepared.'

When he was looking on his wife's iPad, Mr Morales found a note she had written.

It described how she wanted her children to go to college, speak both Spanish and English, and get good jobs. 

Since Mrs Morales' death, family, friends and strangers have clubbed together to support the widower, who faces bringing the children up on his own.

A GoFundMe page set up by Nicole Todman as raised almost $350,000. 

Mrs Morales went into hospital with a swollen foot and tests showed her blood pressure to be 190/90.

On that day she wrote on Facebook: 'He said I have to get admitted until delivery. It's been down lower today but it's too late.

'He will keep me and he ordered some labs.

'He will push deliver up or stall it to to 34 weeks. I'm 31 tomorrow. He said I did phenomenal. A poster child for quads. 

'He wish they could all go this way but this last part we have to do it carefully because u can stroke out with bad blood pressure. I'm sure I won't but he looking at how to finish things.'

After explaining that it would definitely be a premature birth, Mrs Morales added: 'I always want more but sometimes you just have to sit back and thank God for blessing up to this point and put it fully in his hands. Thanks for the prayers and everything else.'
