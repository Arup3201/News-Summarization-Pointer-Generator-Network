Liaison: Sir John Scarlett is helping 'soothe concerns' at No 10

The row over the controversial merger of defence giant BAE with the Franco-German aerospace group EADS took a fresh twist last night after it emerged that Tony Blair’s former spy chief is helping to broker the deal.

Sir John Scarlett, the ex-head of MI6 who played a key role in the infamous ‘dodgy dossier’ on Iraq, has been engaged on the £29 billion deal by investment bank Morgan Stanley – which stands to earn millions if it is approved.

His role will fuel critics’ fears that the proposed merger between the British arms company and EADS is being ‘stitched up’ by high-level Whitehall figures using inside knowledge and connections.

MPs have already called for Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood’s role in the deal to be scrutinised.

Sir Jeremy, a former head of Morgan Stanley’s UK Investment Banking Division, has held a series of private meetings with the bank, BAE and EADS over the past 15 months to discuss the plan – a level of personal involvement described by Tory MP David Davis as ‘highly unusual’. The Commons Defence Select Committee is investigating the merger.

Opponents argue that the new conglomerate would cut costs by slashing jobs, while national security could be placed at risk if it fell under the sway of the French and  German governments.

The Mail on Sunday understands that Sir John, 64, is ‘liaising’ between the bank and the Government to help ‘soothe concerns’ in No 10 about the risks.

Oxford-educated Sir John became chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 2004, retiring five years later. He then took up a portfolio of lucrative City jobs, including an advisory role at Morgan Stanley.

Last night, asked whether Sir John had sought Whitehall clearance to work on the sensitive deal, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘His appointment with Morgan Stanley was approved on the advice of the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments that he should be subject to the condition that, for 12 months from his last day of service, he should not become personally involved in lobbying UK Government Ministers or Crown servants, including special advisers, on behalf of his new employers or their clients. Sir John observed that condition.’

A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment.
