Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has taunted Australian police via his social media account, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians.

The Sydney jihadist is currently in the Middle East fighting with extremist group Islamic State after he evaded authorities in December by fleeing Australia on his brother's passport.

The tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed on Wednesday 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations, with The Daily Telegraph reporting the number was between 40 and 50.

On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'.

Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police.

'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said.

He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'.

These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account.

Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts.

Speaking to media on Thursday, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'.

'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said.

Director General of Security and ASIO chief David Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots.

'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said.

When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

Sharrouf's account is littered with photos of him posing with weapons and military trucks as well as a young child brandishing a rifle
