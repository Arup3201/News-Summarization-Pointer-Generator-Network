Overweight London Mayor Boris Johnson has joined the Prime Minister on a post-Christmas diet after piling on the pounds over the festive holidays.

The Prime Minister said that he was now watching what he eats and taking extra exercise, after admitted: ‘I have put on a bit of Christmas. I can feel a bit of tightening around the belt buckle.’

Mr Johnson yesterday revealed that he had ballooned to more than 16 stone and needed to cut back.

On a visit to Halifax, west Yorkshire, Mr Johnson said: ‘I weighed myself this morning and I am 16 and a half stone and I need to come down by a stone.

‘I'm going to do that through guts and determination, by sheer will‎power, by eating less.

‘I take on an almost unbelievable amount of exercise, but I have a bad habit of eating the children's supper for breakfast.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘I was out pounding the pavements on a run yesterday and I will be doing a bit of light dieting over the next few weeks and hopefully I will shed the pounds.

‘I’m running a couple of miles every other day. It is easier to put it on than to take it off.’

Mr Cameron said he did not weigh himself but admitted he realised he had gained weight after photos emerged of him taking part in an annual Christmas mud run in his.

He told BBC Radio West Midlands he enjoyed running along the canals in Birmingham.

The PM also claimed that he was expert at dodging dog mess while out jogging.

He said: ‘I am pretty nifty on my feet. I can tell you know how to dodge those.’

Four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the Cabinet.

A combination of stress, eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds.

The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread.

In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’

But last summer he was photographed looking portly and sunburned on a beach while on holiday in Cornwall.

At the Conservative Party conference in October he joked that the unflattering photos of him wearing only a Mickey Mouse towel did at least demonstrate he had the ‘stomach for the fight’.

In an interview in January this year the Prime Minister described himself as a ‘middle-aged, slightly overweight man’.

He said he tried to go jogging once or twice a week in parks near Downing Street, and was rarely recognised.

‘The thing about the parks in London is its mostly full of tourists who just see some middle-aged slightly overweight man trotting past them and they just think it’s another one,’ he said.

Questions about the Prime Minister's dieting emerged after photographs showed George Osborne’s fashionable 5:2 diet appears to be paying off, with the Chancellor looking noticeably leaner on the breakfast TV sofa yesterday.

The Chancellor is said to have shed significant amounts of weight by cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week.

It follows his decision to start wearing a hi-tech Jawbone wristband to keep track of his fitness regime and sleep patterns.
