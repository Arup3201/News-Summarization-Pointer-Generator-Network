When first-time mother Kirra Givanni fell pregnant at 39 she was determined to give birth without drugs.

The practicing Tibetan Buddhist, from Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, is so anti-drugs she doesn't even take Panadol, but when she told doctors she wanted to give birth naturally they laughed in her face.

Ms Givanni, now 40, defied doctors' expectations and had her daughter Tara in what she describes as an enjoyable, drug-free experience.

Kirra Givanni was attacked on Facebook after she shared her story about having a drug-free birth at 40

Ms Givanni was laughed at by doctors when she told them she wanted to giver birth to daughter Tara (now seven and a half months old) completely naturally

But when she took to mothers' group Facebook page Bondi Babies to share her story she was attacked by other members, and the comments got so vicious her post was deleted.

'Ladies became very upset with me and wrote that I was shaming them, I was bragging also that I should think before I post because I was being very insensitive,' Ms Givanni told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Givanni said she wrote the post because she wanted to share something positive about birth.

'Because there's so much negativity, no one ever writes anything happy about birth,' she said.

'People who have horrible experiences they're allowed to talk about theirs and no one gets upset'.

'I posted it because I wanted to write something positive and draw out ladies with similar experiences, I wanted to bond with them.'

Ms Givanni, from Vaucluse, said she wanted to write something positive about birth and bond with ladies who had similar experiences

She also wanted to point out that doctors aren't always right.

'A lot of the doctors told me there's no way possible I'd have a natural birth at my age,' she said.

'There's a lot of negativity, but it is possible that you can have a good pregnancy and good birth. I had the best birth and left hospital the next day.'

Ms Givanni believes there was nothing inflammatory about what she wrote.

'Basically I wrote women have been having babies for a long time naturally without drugs, and at my age doctors told me that I couldn't do it, that it would almost be impossible,' she said.

'Then I wrote "I loved giving birth has anyone else experienced this?"

'People were angry… They said it was the way I wrote it.'

Ms Givanni was accused of bragging but she says she was not hurt by any of the comments and she is just disappointed the post was removed from Facebook

Ms Givanni said no one made comments about her age and rather everyone seemed to be angry about the fact she said her birth was drug-free.

'In general people just don't know how to be happy for other people. They told me to not write it because what about the people who have experienced a difficult birth?' she said.

'In general society doesn't know how to rejoice for people having a good experience'.

'Does that mean you can't talk about anything good without upsetting everyone?'

Ms Givanni added that she was not hurt by any of the comments and she is just disappointed the post was removed.

'I wasn't upset by anything anyone wrote. [The page moderator] said there were some inappropriate comments but I didn't find it inappropriate. Why didn't they just delete those comments?' she said.

'I'm not offended, I'm thick-skinned and I believe in free speech, people can write what they want.'

Ms Givanni, a practicing Tibetan Buddhist, met the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India when she was nine weeks pregnant

After the post was taken down an admin for the page sent Ms Givanni a message explaining what had happened.

'Hi Kirra, I am part of the Admin team for BB, and as you are aware your post today has created quite a stir,' she wrote.

'The admin team have actually made a decision to remove the post permanently. It has nothing to do with your original post, but some of the comments are just inappropriate and not useful (& we have also received many PMs about it today).

'I hope you understand! Please don't take this is a criticism of you in any way at all!'

Marietta David, who created the Bondi Babies Facebook page but does not manage it, said the group had grown to be almost 4000 members and she said as it gets bigger, the community is becoming more hostile.

'When things do get nasty as a moderator sometimes the best thing you can do is take the thing down,' Ms David told Daily Mail Australia.

'If things get nasty you sometimes just want to stop the hostility or aggression… It just starts to feed on itself.'
