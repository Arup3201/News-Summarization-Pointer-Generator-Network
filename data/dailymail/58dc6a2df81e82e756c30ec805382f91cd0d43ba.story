Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper, who took part in the Dambusters raids during the Second World War. His medals for gallantry are now up for auction 

The family of an RAF tail gunner who took part in the Second World War's famous Dambusters raid are selling his gallantry medals at auction for £60,000 after finding them in a box.

Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper flew on Wing Commander Guy Gibson's  Lancaster during the mission to destroy a series of dams in Germany using 'bouncing bombs'.

The raid was a great success with two dams breached by the bombs invented by Dr Barnes Wallis and much of Germany’s industrial heartland including scores of armament factories were wiped out in May 1943.

Flight Lieutenant Trevor-Roper, from the Isle of Wight, was singled out for his brave and skillful use of his guns during the raid, which diverted fire from anti-aircraft defences away from other planes in the squadron.

He was then awarded Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions but he was sadly killed just a year later during a bombing raid in Nuremberg.

Now 72 years on, his medals have been unearthed by his family after they had been lying in a dusty box file.

Alongside them were also a series of pictures, including one of the tail gunner with Mr Wallis at Buckingham Palace, they day he received his gallantry medal.

The family, who live in the south of England, have now decided to sell the items, which also includes their own copy of the script from the 1955 film the Dam Busters and a brochure from the premiere to go with it.

It is thought that only a handful of gallantry medals awarded for the mission have ever come on the open market since 1943, with the last group being sold in 2000.

Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset, said: 'These are the most outstanding Second World War RAF medals I have had the pleasure to handle.

'A lot of people did so many brave things in order to shorten the war and the Dambusters raid was definitely one of those.

'All of the crew members for the mission were super-elite and as Trevor-Roper was in the lead plane and was the lead gunner of the squadron.

One of the lots, which is being sold at the auction, which includes a picture of Flight Lieutenant Trevor-Roper, his gallantry medals, a commemorative scroll and his flying cap

'A lot of medals were awarded for that raid but only a handful of them have come on the open market since they were awarded.

'This is the first time Trevor-Roper’s medals have come up for sale.

'It turns out that for many decades the medals, two his RAF side caps, assorted letters, photographs and even a Dam Busters script were kept hidden away in a box file.'

The sale, which takes place on March 19, will also include medals awarded to his father, Major Charles Trevor-Roper, who served with the Hampshire Regiment in the First World War.

Flight Lieutenant Richard Trevor-Roper was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross following the Dambusters raids.

His citation stated: 'This officer flew as rear gunner in the leading Lancaster which attacked the Mohne Dam.

'During the run in, his aircraft was subjected to stiff opposition from flack defences situated along the top of the dam.

'By using his rear guns with great skill, even though bullets were passing through the rear structure of the aircraft just behind him, he succeeded not only in deterring the aim of the defences but later in drawing the fire away from other aircraft which were actually making their bombing runs.

'As gunnery leader, Flight Lieutenant Trevor-Roper has set a magnificent example which is an inspiration to all the other gunners in the squadron.'
