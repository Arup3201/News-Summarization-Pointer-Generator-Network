A police officer who visited a hospital after a dying patient made a 999 call begging for a drink told an inquest he witnessed nursing staff ignoring his requests for water.

PC Matthew Oommen, who visited Kane Gorny after the emergency call at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London, said he heard the patient twice ask for a drink but no water was brought.

Kane, 22, lost more than a third of his body fluid while recovering from a hip operation at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, southwest London.

He needed vital medication to help his body retain fluid and resorted to phoning 999 to beg for a drink.

Officers arrived at Kane Gorny's bedside, but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away.

Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication

The keen footballer and runner from Balham, died of dehydration a few hours later.

He said Mr Gorny had stuck out his tongue and asked: ‘does this look like a dry mouth?’ before asking the nurses for a drink.

He told Westminsters' Coroners Court: 'Kane shouted to the nursing staff "Can I have some water?" There was no water by his bedside and I asked him again to explain why he had called police.

'He stated that he kept asking for water but they wouldn't give it to him. He was complaining of a dry mouth.'

The officer and his colleague left after doctors reassured him Mr Gorny had a history of erratic behaviour following a brain tumour he had suffered the year before.

But the inquest has heard no evidence that Mr Gorny was given any water.

The inquest heard earlier that specialist doctors at the hospital who
 had been treating Kane for a year and knew of his rare medical needs 
were not even told he was in the building until after he died.

‘The guidelines say if patients come 
in, you call us - bleep and we are always available’, said Arshia 
Panahloo, the consultant endocrinologist in charge of his treatment.

‘The best way is to call us because we know the patients. It would be very difficult not to find us.’

Mr Gorny had just been given the all-clear from a malignant brain tumour when he was admitted to St George’s on May 25, 2009.

The inquest heard Mr Gorny’s hip had 
been weakened by steroid’s during the tumour treatment, and he needed a 
replacement operation.

Dr Panahloo was on leave when Mr Gorny
 was admitted but none of her colleagues in the endocrinology 
department, who knew of his specialist medical needs, were told he was 
there.

Inquest: Rita Cronin, left, and Kane's father Peter Gorny arriving at their son's inquest. Rita told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright

‘I wanted him to have the operation at St George’s so I could be involved in his care’, said Dr Panahloo.

‘I would see him before the operation and daily afterwards.

‘He had a rare tumour and was on a 
large amount of hormone replacements. In my opinion, there needed to be 
looked after by an endocrinologist afterwards.

‘I expected to hear the date he was coming in.’

The medication would be taken at least once a day to ensure sodium levels stayed normal and his body could retain fluids.

Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, was denied the medication and sodium
 levels rocketed to an abnormally high 164.

The normal range is between 135 and 145.

On the morning of his death, on May 28, 2009, he had lost nine litres of body fluid, the inquest was told.

Dr Simon Bridle, the consultant in 
charge of Mr Gorny’s care, said he was not told of the sodium reading 
and would have acted if he had known.

The inquest heard Mr Gorny's hip had been weakened by steroid¿s during the tumour treatment, and he needed a replacement operation

‘I don’t think I’ve ever had a patient
 with a sodium level of 164, I would have been very surprised and known 
something was seriously wrong’, he said.

‘Particularly given Kane’s background,
 I would have undoubtedly instructed the endocrinology team to be 
involved as an emergency.’

A letter had been penned by Dr Bridle 
detailing Mr Gorny’s rare condition, but doctors and nurses on the ward 
did not see it when sedating him without ensuring he was being given 
fluids.

Deputy Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe 
asked Dr Panahloo if nurses would have been told of the vital need to 
maintain fluid levels if her team had been involved.

‘If there was any evidence of 
excessive thirst or drinking too much, it is a very early sign that 
there may have been a problem’, said Dr Panahloo.

‘It would have been clearly documented
 on the notes and I would expect the nurses to read that and be aware 
that the fluid balance was important.

‘I would expect them to call us.’

A nurse later admitted knowing little
 about Mr Gorny’s rare medical condition when she left it off notes for 
medical staff at the hospital where he died.

Erlinda Edwards recommended Mr Gorny 
for admission to hospital a day early so that doctors could be fully 
prepared for his hip operation.

But Ms Edwards, a sister at St George’s Hospital admitted that she ‘was not knowledgeable’ about his condition.

She said she decided not to write 
about the disease - diabetes insipidus - on forms for nurses because she
 assumed they already knew about it.

‘I didn’t normally instruct nurses on the ward what to do, what to observe’, she said.

‘I can’t write everything, instructing nurses on the ward whether they should do this and do that.

‘I would expect nurses would know about the diabetes insipidus and know what to observe.’

Ms Edwards said a letter penned by Mr
 Gorny’s consultant Dr Simon Bridle had already outlined the special 
circumstances and the need to liaise with the hospital’s endocrinology 
department, which had been giving Mr Gorny care since his treatment for a
 brain tumour.

But Deputy Coroner Dr Shirley 
Radcliffe criticised Dr Bridle’s letter for being vague and not spelling
 out exactly how Mr Gorny needed to be treated.

Dr Radcliffe pointed to places on Ms Edwards’ assessment form where the condition could have been documented.

‘It could have been, in my view, 
exactly the sort of form that could have conveyed information of the 
management of thirst and output of urine’, she said.

A letter had been penned by Dr Bridle detailing Mr Gorny's rare condition, but doctors and nurses on the ward did not see it

But Ms Edwards said: ‘Because he was 
already being treated and had brain surgery, and also he was a young 
22-year-old, there’s nothing that would alert me.

‘Although he had a medical problem, I didn’t think of writing all of that.’

Dr Radcliffe asked: ‘Did you have a 
clear understanding of the disease when you saw him and the implications
 for post operation management’.

She replied: ‘At the time, I must admit, no’.

Nurses who treated Mr Gorny are due 
to give testify this week that they did not give him medication to help 
his fluid retention because they did not know about the condition.

Dr Bridle has told the inquest he 
expected his nurses to know about the condition from his letter, but did
 not do enough to check to treatment Mr Gorny was given.

The inquest heard Mr Gorny became agitated the day before he died, pulling down the curtain next to his bed on the ward and lashing out at nurses.

Professor Sebastian Lucas, who performed the post mortem on Mr Gorny, said as sodium levels rise in the body, irritability and aggression is a symptom that normally comes before seizures, the patient slipping into a coma, and ultimately dying.

But nurses on the ward sedated him without ensuring he was given intravenous fluids, and still did not give him the vital medication.

Last week his mother Rita Cronin, a 
civil servant told Westminster Coroner's Court that staff tutted at her 
and repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son hadn't 
been given vital medication.

At one point he became so desperate 
and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night 
before his death, his mother said, he was not checked on by medical 
staff, despite being in a room on his own.

Following his death, a nurse 
allegedly inquired whether the family, from Balham, South-West London, 
was 'finished' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could 
'bag him up'.

The inquest continues.
