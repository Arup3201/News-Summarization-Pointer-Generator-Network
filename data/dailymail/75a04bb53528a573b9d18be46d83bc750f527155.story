U.S. authorities said a Pakistani doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden
turned down an opportunity to leave his country and resettle overseas 
with his family, according to U.S. officials.

Dr. Shakil Afridi was jailed last week in Pakistan for 33 years for treason and President Obama's administration has come under steady criticism for its handling of his case.

The unnamed U.S. officials said the resettlement offer for Afridi came around the time of the May 1, 2011, raid in which U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed the al Qaeda leader at his complex in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

They indicated that
Afridi's family would have been welcome to leave Pakistan with him as 
part of the resettlement plan. The officials said he rejected the offer 
for reasons that are unclear.

'Before he was arrested, Doctor Afridi was offered opportunities to leave Pakistan with his family but he turned those down,' one of the U.S. officials said.

'Some may question 
why he did this but no one, including the doctor, could have foreseen 
that Pakistan would punish so severely someone whose work benefited the 
country so much.'

Dr. Afridi was ran a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad and used cheek swabs to try to gather DNA from bin Laden's children to confirm the identity of those living in the compound before the May 2011 raid.

The DNA effort 
ultimately did not succeed but U.S. sources have told Reuters he helped 
American operatives locate and follow the bin Laden courier who led them
to the Abbottabad hideout.

The offer for 
Afridi to leave Pakistan was confirmed independently by two U.S. 
officials. The White House and State Department declined comment on the 
matter.

Afridi's case has 
damaged U.S.-Pakistan relations with outraged U.S. senators voting last 
week to cut aid to Pakistan by $33 million - $1 million for each year of
the doctor's prison sentence.

U.S. officials said the resettlement offer for Afridi came about the time of the May 1, 2011, raid in which U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed Osama bin-Laden

'It's arbitrary, but the hope is that Pakistan will realise we are 
serious,' said Senator Richard Durbin, the Senate's 
second-highest-ranking Democrat.

The US Secretary of State, Hillary 
Clinton, added he disapproval and called the doctor's jailing 'unjust and unwarranted' and vowed 
to press the case with Islamabad.

Pakistan has said Washington should respect its court's decision.

Pakistani authorities
arrested Afridi several weeks after the bin Laden raid.

In the 
intervening period, U.S. authorities believed they would have had ample 
time to get him out of the country if he had wanted to leave.

Another official 
said it was not usual for people in Afridi's situation to reject 
resettlement offers

The official said Afridi may have believed that 
rather than becoming the object of character attacks and accusations of 
treason by Pakistani authorities, he might instead have won praise for 
his role in helping rid Pakistan of a threat to its security and 
stability.

And in another twist 
to a case that is straining Islamabad's ties with Washington, a 
Pakistani court says the doctor who helped the United States find Osama 
bin Laden was imprisoned for aiding militants and not for his links to 
the CIA.

It is the third different explanation for the 33-year jail sentence handed to Dr. Afridi.

Last
week after his conviction by a court in the Khyber tribal region near 
the Afghan border, Pakistani officials said the decision was based on 
treason charges for aiding the CIA in its hunt for the al Qaeda chief.

When that announcement rankled U.S. officials, Pakistan then said the doctor had a history of womanising.

team watched the mission to find bin Laden in the Situation Room of the

But
the judgment document made available to the media on Wednesday states 
that Afridi was jailed because of his close ties to the banned militant 
group Lashkar-e-Islam, which amounts to waging war against the state.

It is unclear why Pakistani officials first said Afridi was jailed over his links to the CIA.

One of the doctor's lawyers, Samiullah Afridi, was baffled after reading the verdict, which he also received on Wednesday.

Both Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta have expressed their displeasure at Dr Shakil Afridi's imprisonment

'These charges against him are very different from the ones we were told earlier,' said Samiullah.

Afridi's brother 
Jamil has described the treason charges as baseless and said the doctor 
was being made a scapegoat.

'If my brother had 
done something wrong, he had a valid U.S. visa. He could have fled the 
country,' said Jamil after the sentence was handed down, adding that the
family had received no offers of help from the U.S. government

In Washington, government sources said the United States is making strenuous efforts to win Afridi's release from jail.

U.S.
officials hail Afridi as a hero who helped the CIA track down bin 
Laden, who was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in a raid in the Pakistani town
of Abbottabad in May last year.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suggested on Sunday that the jailing of Afridi would hurt efforts to repair relations.

Many
Pakistanis were infuriated by the U.S. raid to get bin Laden in a town 
just a two-hour drive from Islamabad and they see Afridi as a villain 
who conspired against the state and brought unwanted scrutiny of 
Pakistan's attitude to militants.

Pakistani officials describe bin Laden's long 
presence in the garrison town of Abbottabad as a security lapse and 
reject suggestions that members of the military or intelligence services
were complicit in hiding him there.

Reports from Pakistan also suggest that Dr. Shakil Afridi was sentenced for links to Islamic militants and not for aiding U.S intelligence services
