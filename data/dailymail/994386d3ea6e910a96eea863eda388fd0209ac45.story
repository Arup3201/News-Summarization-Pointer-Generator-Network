A legal complaint has been made against a Washington DC bar after a homophobic slur was allegedly printed on a receipt.

Bistro 18 in Adams Morgan is accused of discrimination after a transgender customer was handed a receipt with the words 'Gay b*****s' printed on it.

Amira Gray, who visited the restaurant in August last year with a group of friends, said she humiliated by the way she had been treated by staff.

Ms Gray, a transgender woman, also claimed that wait staff at the bistro had treated her group differently to other customers.

She said that although other groups were served at their table, Ms Gray and her friends had to order at the bar every time they wanted drinks, and that 'no wait staff approached our table'.

When a waitress handed Ms Gray her check at the end of the night, the phrase 'Gay b*****s' had been printed at the top.

'As a transgender woman I was extremely hurt, embarrassed, and upset,' Ms Gray wrote in her statement on the legal complaint.

'I felt the slur was meant as a slap in the face because of my gender identity and expression ... and my friends who are or may have been perceived as being lesbian or gay.'

Ms Gray said one of her friends confronted the manager about what had been printed on the receipt, but claimed the manager removed the check and printed a new one without the slur.

Her friend had retained a copy of the original, which was released by transgender rights group Lambda Legal.

Claims: A legal complaint has been made against Bistro 18 over allegations that it discriminated against customer Amira Gray

'That this
 happened in Washington, D.C., where LGBT people have strong protections
 from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender 
identity, and personal appearance, points out the importance of ensuring
 existing laws are enforced,' Dru Levasseur, of Lambda Legal, said.

'By
 standing up for herself and her friends, Amira is taking a stand for 
all LGBT people who are targeted by businesses for unequal treatment 
because of who they are.'

In a press release issued by Lambda Legal, Ms Gray said: 'We went in planning to enjoy Bistro 18 
just like everyone else in the hookah bar that evening, but it turned 
into a disturbing experience.

'I am standing up for my friends and me 
because I don't think anyone should have to go through that.'

Bistro 18 has not yet commented on the legal complaint being brought against it.
