Ibiza and Tenerife are two of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists but many of them cannot pinpoint the Spanish islands on a map, according to new research.

A holiday price comparison website compiled a list of the 20 most-visited resorts and asked people who had recently returned from a summer break to mark the holiday hot spots on a map.

A huge 68.5 per cent of the 3,000 holidaymakers questioned by Icelolly.com were unable to pinpoint the country for all 20 of the resorts.

Party island: 12 per cent of people thought Ibiza,  part of the Balearic Islands, was a separate country

Turning Japanese: Ten per cent of people thought Thailand’s capital Bangkok was in Japan

Tenerife in the Canary Islands fared the worst with nearly a fifth of people (19 per cent) placing it on the map incorrectly.

This was followed by Cancun, Mexico (18 per cent), Prague, Czech Republic (16 per cent), Marrakesh, Morocco (16 per cent) and Jamaica in the Caribbean (15 per cent).

Ten per cent of people thought Thailand’s capital Bangkok was in Japan while 12 per cent thought Ibiza, which is part of the Balearic Islands, was a separate country.

Meanwhile, six per cent of people thought Jamaica was in Africa and five per cent thought it was possible to drive from London to Dublin, not realising that they would have to navigate across the Irish Sea.

Tenerife is a  popular destination for British tourists but nearly a fifth placed it on the map incorrectly

1. Ibiza (Balearic Islands, Spain)

2. Crete (Greece)

3. Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain)

4. Marbella (Costa Del Sol, Spain)

5. Cancun (Mexico)

6. Zante (Greece)

7. Florida (USA)

8. Prague (Czech Republic)

9. Marmaris (Turkey)

10. San Francisco (USA)

11. Dubai (UAE)

12. Algarve (Portugal)

13. Marrakesh (Morocco)

14. Benidorm (Costa Blanca, Spain)

15. Paris (France)

16. Amsterdam (The Netherlands)

17. Bangkok (Thailand)

18. Venice (Italy)

19. Dublin (Ireland)

20. Jamaica (Caribbean)

Embarrassingly for parents, children fared better than adults when it came to naming all 20 countries.

Nearly six in ten (58 per cent) of those aged seven to 15 admitted to ignoring where the country of their most recent holiday featured on an atlas and less than a third (31 per cent) were able to accurately locate all 20 countries.

Of the 16-25 year olds, 39 per cent accurately located all 20 countries however, only 24 per cent of people aged between 26 and 40 were able to replicate that feat.

Suniel Makh, Icelolly's Brand Director commented: ‘We're a nation of boomerang holidaymakers - we tend to return to the same holiday spots from one year to another. 

'So although we holiday abroad the most frequently, we're actually one of the least well-travelled bunch when it comes to the breadth of countries we've visited, with the average Brit visiting only six different countries in their lifetime.

‘Although there is still a strong demand for the typical adolescent booze-fuelled getaways, more and more are opting to travel to long-haul destinations such as Thailand and Australia and see the world before settling down and getting a job.

‘These younger travellers are seeing more of the world and developing a sounder geographical knowledge than that of their parents and younger siblings.'
