Rodney King's fiancee said in a frantic 911 call that she threw a shovel to try and wake him up after she woke to the sounds of a fall and found him at the bottom of his swimming pool.

Cynthia Kelley can be heard repeatedly urging authorities to hurry to King's Rialto, California, home early on Sunday.

In audio of the call released Tuesday, Kelley tells a dispatcher that she tried to rouse King but he wasn't responding.

Untimely death: Rodney King, pictured in the swimming pool at his California home, was found dead at the bottom of it on Sunday

Mysterious: King's fiancee told a 911 dispatcher that she awoke to the sound of King falling into the pool, pictured, and came outside to find him at the bottom of it

'He's not moving,' Kelley said, crying throughout the call.

'I was sleeping, all of a sudden I heard something fall like the table and then I looked over and then I went to find him and he's at the bottom of the swimming pool. He's still there. Please hurry up.'

The 5-minute, 15-second phone call ends with the arrival of police officers who pulled King from the pool and began life-saving efforts.

He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Police have said they have found no signs of foul play and continue to investigate King's case as an accidental drowning.

Earlier on Tuesday, TMZ reported that King's relationship with Kelley was not going well, and he was considering leaving her.

The site said that Damon Feldman, a longtime friend of King's, told police that he believes there is more to his death than what Kelley is telling them.

Authorities are awaiting toxicology results and said they'll use them in conjunction with an autopsy performed Monday to determine how King died.

The dispatcher asked Kelley, whom 
King met when she was a juror on his civil lawsuit against the four 
officers who beat him, if she was able to get into the pool to get King 
out, but she said she couldn't.

She said she tried to 'wake him up,' including throwing a shovel into the water, but he wasn't responding.

At one point, Kelley told dispatchers that the man in the pool was King, 'the guy that got beat by the police.'

Results: King's family will have to wait six weeks before they know how King died

Kelley, who was interviewed by police for several hours Sunday, is heard on the audio saying she needs to call King's family.

It was reported on Tuesday that results from toxicology tests could 
take as long as six weeks to gather before coroner's officials can 
determine how Rodney King died.

The outcome will show whether 
King, who struggled with addiction throughout his life, had any alcohol 
or drugs in his system at the time of his death.

Police have said there were no signs of alcohol or drug paraphernalia 
near the pool.

But officers were seen taking a marijuana plant out of the 
house Sunday.

King became famous after his severe beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was captured on videotape and broadcast worldwide.

The beating was captured on 
videotape and broadcast worldwide, as were photos of King's bloodied and
bruised face.

The more than 50 baton blows and kicks inflicted by 
officers left King with 11 skull fractures, a broken eye socket and 
facial nerve damage.

The trial of four officers charged with felony assault in the beating ended after a jury with no black members acquitted three of the officers on state charges; a mistrial was declared for a fourth.

The verdict sparked one of the most costly and deadly race riots in the nation's history.

In his recently-published memoir, The
Riot Within: My Journey from Rebellion to Redemption’, King said that 
the course of his life had been changed forever by the night of his 
assault.

He described how FBI agents had warned
him a riot was expected if the officers were acquitted, and urged him 
to keep a low profile so as not to inflame passions.

Speaking ahead of the 20th anniversary
of the riots, King said racism still has to be challenged. He published
a memoir, "The Riot Within: My Journey From Rebellion to Redemption," 
to mark the anniversary

But in an interview earlier this year, he said that he was a happy man.

‘America's been good to me after I 
paid the price and stayed alive through it all,’ he says. ‘This part of 
my life is the easy part now.’
