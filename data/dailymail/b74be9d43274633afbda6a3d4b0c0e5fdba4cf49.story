Experts have today called for half-day closing on the high street to be brought back to stop overworked shop employees suffering stress.

The move would be familiar to millions of older people who will remember when whole town centres across the UK closed down at lunchtime one day a week to prevent shop staff being exploited. 

One leading psychologist said the move would have a similar effect today.

Professor Craig Jackson, from Birmingham City University, said it would compensate millions of low-paid employees, who put in hours of overtime.

He said it could also save the NHS millions of pounds a year in treating those who suffer stress and other conditions related to working too hard.  

Professor Jackson said millions of employees regularly work through lunchbreaks, stay late or come in early for no extra pay.

Many are low paid workers who fear losing their jobs and will put in extra hours for no money in order to show willing.

He said: 'The UK workforce still has the highest mean number of full-time working hours of any European country.

'As a country we work too many hours - and we also rely on the culture of unpaid overtime and the willingness of millions of employees to work outside of the 9 to 5 for free, on a regular basis.

'Working unpaid overtime is now expected of workers in countless organisations, and technological advances facilitate this.'

These advances include being contacted by email or text in out-of-office hours and even on holiday.

Trading laws from the beginning of the 20th Century limited the hours shops and many business could operate across a working week. This included being shut on Sundays.

To regulate these hours, they had to close for half a day during the week, with most areas choosing Wednesday afternoons.

This prevented children from working in their parents' shops for more than 72 hours a week, for instance.

The law was repealed in 1994 though in some areas, local traders came to a mutual agreement to all close one afternoon a week, usually on the quietest trading day.

Professor Jackson added: 'Since the trading laws were relaxed in the 1990s, millions of people in the retail sector in the UK have felt the effects of the shopping culture.

'A suitable remedy would be for companies to voluntarily bring back 'half-day closing' for one day each week.

'It would give workers a break, and allow them to do other beneficial things in their lives, and any lost 'revenue' that may occur as a result would easily be saved by fewer workers needing to access the NHS and their GPs for countless work-related psychosocial issues such as stress.'
