Labor Opposition leader John Robertson has been forced to step down from his role after it was revealed he wrote a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis.

In the letter to the NSW Department of Community Services in August, 2011, Mr Robertson asked for Monis to be granted at least one hour's supervised access to his sons on Father's Day.

The decision to resign comes just three months out from the NSW state election, which is expected to be won by the Michael Baird-led coalition government. 

Mr Robertson, 52, has been under fire for his response to the revelation he wrote the letter, after he intially refused to release publically release his correspondence with Monis, then said his office 'didn't have time to Google' the past crimes of Monis before signing the letter.

'It has become clear to me that I've lost the support of some of my Labor colleagues,' Mr Robertson said.

'So as a lifelong Labor man, I have decided to step aside as Labor leader.'

Mr Robertson, the member for Blacktown, had been leader since March 2011, when the party lost government after one of the worst election routs in the state's history.

In the letter, Mr Robertson asked for Monis to be granted access to his sons despite his estranged wife Noleen Hayson Pal, having an Apprehended Violence Order issued against him.

Mr Robertson also wrote his letter in support of Monis depsite the fact he had been prosecuted for sending offensive letters to the families of death Australian soldiers.

"[Monis] has asked me to appeal to you, to grant him a supervised access visit of at least one hour in your Liverpool office for Father's Day," Mr Robertson wrote to Community Services in August, 2011.

"He is requesting visits ... on a regular basis of at least one to two times per week until the Family Law Court matter has been resolved."

At the time, Monis was a resident of Mr Robertson's Blacktown constituency in Sydney's western suburbs

Referring to the letter he sent on behalf of Monis, Mr Robertson said he accepted how it might appear given last week's siege, which ended in the deaths of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson.

'The tragic event at Martin Placed touched the lives of people across our city, our state and our nation,' he said.

'My heart goes out to the victims and their families, specially today.

'I offer my sincere condolences and they should know that we all are grieving with them.'

Mr Robertson said he was disappointed that after four years he was not going to lead Labor to the 2015 poll.

But he was proud of his role in clamping down on corruption within the NSW party branch.

'I have rid the party of those who betrayed the great Labor cause,' he said.

'We have dragged the party out of the pit of electoral oblivion.'

Mr Robertson then wrote to Monis after his request was denied, referring to the organisation Lone Father Association of Australia for further support.

The correspondence was released on Monday afternoon.

Despite signing the letter, Mr Robertson continues to deny he endorsed Monis.

He said it was a straightforward matter similar to the thousands of constituent requests handled by politicians every year.

"This was a letter that forwarded a request to an agency," he said.

"It in no way supported or endorsed anything that this man was asking for."

Mr Robertson played down the significance of his signature, saying he signs every letter out of his office as a matter of protocol.

All correspondence has been forwarded to the joint investigation into the Martin Place siege.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Monday that the nation must learn from its 'brush with terrorism'.

"If this review shows that there are further policy changes needed, they will be done," he told the Nine Network's Today show.

His comments came after it emerged that the national security hotline was tipped off about Monis's extremism only days before the Martin Place siege.

Mr Abbott said officials looked at Monis's website but took no further action because there were no imminent threats of violence.
