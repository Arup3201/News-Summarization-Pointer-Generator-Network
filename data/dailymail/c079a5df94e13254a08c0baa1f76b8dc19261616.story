The run-up to the Super Bowl on Sunday has been marred by deflate-gate - and it's  hurting Tom Brady's feelings.

The New England Patriots quarterback says he took football tampering allegations personally after  11 of the 12 footballs tested by the NFL were found to be two PSI less than league minimums.

Brady once again denied having anything to do with the fact that they were improperly inflated in an interview with WEEI sports radio in Boston on Monday.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady says reports he was involved in deflate-gate 'hurt his feelings'

'I’ve tried to wrap my head around it, too. I’ve done that and I’m trying to move past that, because I continue to try to rehash things,' he said. 

'I personalized a lot of things and thought this was all about me, and my feelings got hurt. 

'Then I moved past it, because it’s not serving me.'

The Patriots are still fending off cheating allegations less than a week before the Super Bowl, where they will face the Seattle Seahawks this coming Sunday.

Already, some Seahawks are speaking out about the NFL's investigation of 'deflate-gate.' 

Richard Sherman, the Seattle cornerback, says he doesn't believe the Patriots will be punished for breaking the rules because Patriots owner Robert Kraft is so close to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. 

'Will they be punished? Probably not. Not as long Robert Kraft and Roger Goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes. He was just at Kraft's house last week before the AFC Championship. Talk about conflict of interest. As long as that happens, it won't affect them at all,' Sherman fumed. 

Brady told WEEI that he has now blocked out the deflate-gate speculation and is working to focus 100 percent on the upcoming Super Bowl - his sixth appearance with the Patriots. 

On Sunday, he told ESPN that he hadn't been contacted by NFL investigators - and didn't expect to hear from them until after the big game. 

Investigators found that 11 out of the 12 footballs used by the Patriots offense during the AFC Championship game were under-inflated, which makes them easier to throw, catch and carry

The Indianapolis Colts complained that the Patriots' footballs were under-inflated during their 45-7 drubbing in the AFC Championship game on January 18.

Under-inflated balls are easier to catch and throw in bad weather and they are also easier to carry and harder to fumble. 

Sports statistician Warren Sharp wrote last week that the Patriots' historically low fumble rate - once every 187 plays - is almost statistically impossible, and dramatically better than even the runner-up team.

This Patriots team was able to achieve the record while running more than 200 more running plays than the team with then next-lowest fumble rate - the 2006-2010 Indianapolis Colts.
