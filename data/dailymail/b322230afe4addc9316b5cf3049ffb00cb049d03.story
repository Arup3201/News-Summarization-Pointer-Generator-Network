After a day-long lull in Britain’s gold rush on Friday, it appeared as if Team GB may have had its fill of Olympic glory.

But yesterday morning at the rowing lake at Eton Dorney – the scene of so many gold-medal-winning triumphs for British oarsmen – the man they call ‘the Usain Bolt of the water’ had other ideas.

On the final full day of competition at the Games, Britain’s ‘human hydrofoil’ Ed McKeever set the standard for another day of Team GB success by storming to gold in the 200m sprint kayak.

Crouched forward, arms whirring at the extraordinary rate of three strokes a second, the 28-year-old became the fifth Team GB hero to be crowned Olympic champion on this beautiful Berkshire lake.

The ‘Dorney roar’ from the 20,000-strong crowd thronging the banks drove on McKeever – who is due to marry next month – as he blasted  to the front of the world-class field of sprint kayakers, described as the sport’s equivalent of Ferraris. In winning Team GB’s 26th gold medal, McKeever becomes only the second Briton in history to win  the Olympic title in the sport after Tim Brabants took gold in Beijing four years ago. It put an end to a barren run on the lake for Britain’s flat-water paddlers, who struggled to repeat last week’s glorious successes enjoyed by the rowing squad which took gold in four events.

‘Crossing the line was fantastic,’ said McKeever, a trainee accountant, who unlike Bolt is no extrovert.

‘I’m just so happy to contribute to the medal table. I thought I might struggle because I was light and more affected by the strong wind.

‘But I got a clean start. It was just relief at the end, not elation. I was  so happy I could do it in front of the home crowd.’

McKeever burst into an early lead and then held on to finish in a time of 36.2 seconds. He splashed the water and punched the air in jubilation as he crossed the line.

A stiff wind in his face meant he could not match his Olympic record time, which was more than second quicker, set in the heats.

‘I knew coming into this that I was ready,’ he said. ‘I just wanted to go out and do my best race. If I did that, I knew I would come away with something. To come away with gold is brilliant.

‘It was really painful down the last bit with that headwind. I was really just focused on the first two or three strokes, I wanted to nail those and hope the race sorted itself out and  it did. The crowd helped to cheer  me on. When they announced my name and I got a cheer, it made my hair stand on end.’

McKeever has previously laughed off comparisons with Bolt, but yesterday he said: ‘I have the gold medal to go with it now, so I am more willing to accept that tag-line.’

With Olympic glory secured, he can now focus on marrying his  fiancee, PE teacher Anya Kucjak.

McKeever was a pupil at St Laurence comprehensive school in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, when he joined his first canoe club at 12.

Five years later he took part in the Junior World Championships and by 19 he was part of the GB senior team. ‘It was one of those things – you do a few races and you realise you are quite good at it. Winning races is quite infectious,’ he said.

He was training to compete in the 500m Olympic event when it was dropped in 2009 in favour of the 200m sprint. The shorter, more explosive race suited him and a year later he was the World and European Champion in the discipline.

Since then he has finished on the podium in every international event he has raced in.
