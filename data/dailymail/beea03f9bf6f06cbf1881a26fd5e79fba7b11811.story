Television presenter Fiona Phillips has claimed a ‘chemical cosh’ of dementia drugs robbed her father of the final weeks of his life.

The former GMTV host described how her father Neville was given a vast cocktail of medicines which left him so heavily sedated he was ‘totally out of it’.

His medication covered two sides of an A4 sheet of paper, she said.

Alzheimer’s sufferer Mr Phillips died 
earlier this month. His rapid deterioration has led his daughter to 
question whether the drugs cost him years of his life.

She said: ‘I am so angry at the way my
lovely, lovely dad was treated at the end. In his final weeks he was so
coshed by drugs that his poor body couldn’t cope.

‘They robbed him of his laughter, then
his smile, which was all that he had got left, and I am absolutely 
furious about that. Then they robbed him of his life.

‘That is what is keeping me awake at 
night now, it’s the anger. Without the powerful drugs they used to 
sedate him he could have had another few years.

More than a quarter of elderly people with dementia are being given dangerous ‘chemical cosh’ drugs, researchers warn.

Doctors
are prescribing anti-psychotics to patients for two or more years even 
though they are only meant to be taken for a maximum of three months – 
and then only as a last resort.

Antipsychotics
are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in 
patients with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses.

But
researchers from the University of Manchester have found that in most cases they are just being given to 
sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off or becoming 
confused and anxious.

Campaigners
say that too often they are being told by families and carers that such
drugs are ‘robbing loved ones of their dignity’, leaving them unable to
walk or talk.

The drugs were given the chemical cosh 
nickname because they are used to subdue patients, which makes it easier
for hospital and care home staff to look after them.

But
researchers have warned that they double the risk of early death – 
leading to an estimated 1,800 premature deaths a year – and treble the 
risk of strokes. Studies have also found they reduce brain volume and 
worsen the symptoms of dementia.

Typical antipsychotics given to patients 
include chlorpromazine, perphenazine, pimozide, clozapine (sold as 
Clozaril or Denzapine), olanzapine (sold as Zyprexa) and risperidone 
(sold as Risperdal). But only risperidone is licensed for dementia – and
then only for up to six weeks.

‘Maybe I’m being selfish because he 
wouldn’t have wanted to continue to be dependent on others. But that 
wasn’t a decision to be made by the medical system on his behalf ... 
Without those drugs he could still have been healthy and happy, even 
with dementia.’

Miss Phillips, 51, has endured 
watching both her parents succumb to Alzheimer’s and has told of her 
fears she may also develop the degenerative disease.

Her mother Amy was diagnosed in her 
late 50s and died in 2006, just a few months before Mr Phillips also 
received the devastating diagnosis. He was in his late 60s.

Miss Phillips, a Daily Mirror 
columnist, told the newspaper her father had managed a degree of 
independence despite the disease, and lived in a warden-assisted flat in
Hampshire for three years.

But last November he went missing for 
eight hours after he wandered off alone. Social workers insisted he was 
sent to a specialist dementia care home.

The placement lasted just 24 hours 
before managers complained that he had lashed out at a carer. He was 
moved to a psychiatric hospital, where he was immediately put on a 
mixture of drugs.

Miss Phillips said: ‘I visited him on 
December 23 and he was smiling and laughing and said “She’s mine” when I
walked in, which had been his way of greeting me for a while.

‘Even though he no longer said my name, he recognised me. All the members of staff said how wonderful he was.’

But when she returned a few days 
later, she said she found her father slumped in a chair and heavily 
sedated. She requested a list of his medication and said it stretched to
two sides of A4 paper.

Miss Phillips recalled how she asked 
for the drugs to be reduced and told how her own research had shown two 
sedatives he was taking were addictive and could cause cognitive 
decline.

In addition, she said that the 
anti-psychotic drug he was on was known to increase the risk of death in
dementia sufferers and was advised as a last resort.

She described her shock on her next 
visit at her father’s rapid deterioration, saying: ‘He’d put on weight 
from the drugs and his hair was white. “Oh Dad,” I said, “What have they
done to you?” And I broke down in tears.

‘But there was no response, he was totally out of it. His body had been clobbered with drugs.

‘He was like someone out of One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. My heart was broken. Next time I went his eyes 
were glazed, his mouth was hanging open and his tongue was lolling.’

Miss Phillips said she alerted nurses 
to her father’s laboured breathing and high temperature and, six days 
later, he was admitted to a general hospital with pneumonia. Doctors 
warned his organs were failing. He died a few days later, aged 77.

Researchers have revealed that more than a quarter of elderly dementia sufferers are being subdued with ‘chemical cosh’ drugs.

They warned earlier this month that 
some medications can double the risk of early death – leading to an 
estimated 1,800 premature deaths a year – and treble the risk of 
strokes. Studies have also found they reduce brain volume and worsen the
symptoms of dementia.

The Daily Mail has long called for an 
improvement in the care of dementia sufferers as part of our Dignity for
the Elderly campaign.

Miss Phillips, who has two sons, 
Nathaniel, 12, and Mackenzie, nine, with her husband Martin Frizell, has
become an ambassador for the Alzheimer’s Society.
