A Vine superstar who boasts millions more followers than Justin Bieber has been forced to apologize after making a homophobic slur in one of his clips.

Nash Grier, 16, from North Carolina, filmed a portion of a PSA commercial stating: 'Testing for HIV. It's not a gay thing.' The video then cuts to Grier, yelling: 'Yes it is! Fag!'

After facing criticism from many of his 8.7million followers, the Christian-raised teenager swiftly issued a statement to Twitter on Sunday where he described himself as 'ignorant', 'stupid' and 'in a bad place.'

He continued: 'I’ve moved on and learned from my mistakes and I am so truly sorry to anyone I have offended.

'I have nothing against anyone or anything that promotes equality. Sorry again.'

Grier reportedly posted the offending six-second-long clip back in April but then deleted it.

However, this weekend the footage resurfaced and started circulating online.

After it was reposted by YouTube star and LGBT advocate youth, Tyler Oakley, 25, Grier faced mounting pressure to explain himself.

'Promoting a false stereotype that HIV only affects gays to his millions of teen fans is extremely dangerous,' Oakley angrily tweeted.

He then added: 'Call me and people like me, "fag" all you want, but spreading false information about deadly diseases is next level.'

Less than an hour later, Grier took to Twitter stating how he'd had 'grown up' in the past three months.

'I apologize for anything negative I’ve said towards gays and for that matter anyone. I was young,' he said.

In an April interview with New York Mag, the high school sophomore said he likes to keep things light-hearted and create 'happy' posts.

'Be happy. Don’t make a Vine about, like, something not that happy. I don’t use cuss words, I try not to do anything awful. You don’t want to lower your audience.'

He said he has been surprised by his sudden success, which is set to pay off financially.

The
 teen has been approached by international media firms like London-based
 Viral Spiral, who imagine web series spinoffs and even merchandise in 
an attempt to monetize what is still basically a hobby.
