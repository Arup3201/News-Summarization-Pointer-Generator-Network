Ottawa police are hunting the killer of a teenage ‘guardian angel’, who was stabbed to death as he tried to protect a friend caught up in a vicious, drunken street brawl.

Brandon Volpi, 18, died after being stabbed in the neck and chest by an unknown attacker in the early hours of Saturday morning outside the downtown Les Suites Hotel.

Volpi, who attended the city's St. Patrick’s High School, was apparently staying at the hotel following a school prom, and ventured outside at around 3.35am having being disturbed by a street fight between students from rival schools.

One of his friends was injured and Volpi was trying to help him when he was attacked, it was reported.

Volpi’s father, Danny, wrote on Facebook: ‘To my dear son may you rest in peace. I miss you with all my heart. May justice be served and find who killed my son.’

On Sunday evening a crowd of around 200 people, mostly made up of students, held a tearful vigil for Volpi, who was a popular member of the school, outside the Les Suites Hotel.

Dozens of flowers and candles along with a framed photograph of Volpi had been placed at the base of a monument at the front of the hotel, the Ottawa Citizen reported.

Volpi’s death led to an outpouring of grief on Facebook from his fellow students, who praised his nature.

Kristina Wazen wrote: ‘Thank you to everyone that attended the vigil, we are coming together to remember a hero. St. Pats, we are a family and always will be. Rest in Paradise my sweet angel, you are a fallen solider that will never be forgotten. You will always live in our hearts, I love you more than words can explain. Our new guardian angel.’

And Azzah Al Tkrity said: ‘You will forever live in our hearts.’

‘Police responded to a call for service at approximately 3:35am in relation to a stabbing that occurred outside a local hotel. The male succumbed to injuries at a local hospital.

'A second male victim also received minor injuries, was treated at hospital and released.'
