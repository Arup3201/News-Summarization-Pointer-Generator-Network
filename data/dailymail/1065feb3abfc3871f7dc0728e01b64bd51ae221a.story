They are famed for making his nose grow - but Pinocchio’s lies could have been fatal, according to new research.

Scientists say the wooden puppet could only have told 13 fibs before his nose became so long and heavy that his neck snapped.

In a bit of fun research, Steffan Llewllyn, of Leicester University, began by estimating the dimensions and properties of Pinocchio’s head.

The story of Pinocchio became a huge hit when it was made into a popular Disney film in 1940, but scientists say the puppet would not have been able to tell any more than 13 lies

He then estimated that carved from oak, it would have weighed just over 9lb, with a nose an inch in length.

If the nose doubled in length which each lie, the thirteenth would have put such a strain on his neck that it would have broken.

The researcher said he realised that the ability of Pinocchio's nose to grow was 'extraordinary'.

He added: 'Nevertheless, this unique ability can be of great concern for the puppet, and lengthy, extensive lies are advised against, for the health and wellbeing of Pinocchio.'

The analysis of the children’s favourite by Carlo Collodi is detailed in the Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics which showcases fun but accurate science done by students.

Carlo Collodi, Pinocchio's creator, has had the science behind his famous character tested by scientists

The researcher's theory was not tested in the popular tale, as in the original story, written by the Italian author in 1883, the puppet only told three lies.

The study is the latest report to examine the myths and science behind popular cartoons and fairytales.

Last year, researchers claimed that the  legendary strengthening effect that eating spinach had on cartoon character Popeye was born out of a mathmatical mistake by a German scientist.

In 1870, German chemist Erich von Wolf was researching the amount of iron in spinach and other green vegetables.

When writing up his findings in a new notebook, he misplaced a decimal point, making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality.

The story goes that cartoon creators were aware of the supposedly miraculous health properties of spinach spread by the erroneous research and had the idea that Popeye should eat spinach to increase his strength.
