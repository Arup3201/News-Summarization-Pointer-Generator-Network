A secret US government communication concludes that the Syrian army more than likely used chemical weapons during an attack in the city of Homs last month.

The document, leaked to The Cable, reveals the finding of an investigation by Scott Frederic Kilner, the U.S. consul general in Istanbul, into accusations that the Syrian army used chemical weapons in the December 23 attack.

An Obama administration official who had
access to the document was reported as saying: 'We can't definitely say
100 per cent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 
was used in Homs on Dec. 23.'

The Syrian city of Homs has seen some of the worst fighting in Syria, with a US cable now suggesting it came under chemical attack by Assad forces on December 23

Chemical weapon known as Agent 15 was suspected to have been used in the attack on Homs

Developed in the 1960s by the U.S., Agent-15, or  3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate, is one of the most hallucinogenic chemical warfare compounds ever developed.

An odourless, colourless incapacitating agent it can be absorbed into the central nervous system through respiration, ingestion, or through skin contact.

Exposure to just 6.2 micrograms per kilogram of body mass is enough to incapacitate half of the number of people exposed to it.

Mr Kilner's investigation included interviews
with civilians, doctors, and rebels present during the attack, as well 
as the former general and head of the Syrian WMD program, Mustafa 
al-Sheikh.

Dr. Nashwan Abu Abdo, a neurologist in 
Homs, is certain chemical weapons were used. He told The Cable: 'It was a
chemical weapon, we are sure of that, because tear gas can't cause the 
death of people.'

Eye witness accounts from the 
inverstigation reveal that a tank launched chemical weapons and caused 
people exposed to them to suffer nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
delirium, seizures, and respiratory distress.

The symptoms suggest that the weaponised compound Agent-15 was responsible.

agent it can be absorbed into the central nervous system through 
respiration, ingestion, or through skin contact.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights,
an activist network based in Britain, also said in December that six 
Syrian rebels had died after inhaling 'white smoke without a smell' in Homs.

Syria's embattled President Bashar al-Assad, pictured here making a public address last week, is living on a warship guarded by Russian naval forces, according to reports

Syria denied using chemical weapons and said it would never use them against citizens.

Speaking
to Pentagon reporters last week, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said his biggest 
concern was how the U.S. and allies would secure the chemical and 
biological weapons sites scattered across Syria and ensure the 
components don't end up in the wrong hands if the regime falls, 
particularly under violent conditions.

Certainly it would seem that the country's leader is prepared to do whatever it takes to maintain power.

President Bashar Assad is now believed to travels to meetings in his presidential palace in Damascus by helicopter after moving to a warship off the Syrian coast.

Intelligence sources have said the president was being protected on the warship by Russian naval forces.

The move is said to have come about after the president lost confidence in his own security detail.

Intelligence sources told the Saudi daily paper al-Watan the president was being protected by Russia, which effectively amounted to political asylum, The Times of Israel has reported.

Al-Watan was told Assad's fear of advances by the opposition in the capital was one of the reasons why he has moved to the ship.

The dictator, pictured here with his wife Asma Al-Assad, is said to have moved with his family and aides to the warship because of his fear of advances by the opposition in the capital

His current position is also thought to allow a quick evacuation to Moscow if it became necessary.

Russia has remained an ally of the regime since the popular uprising in March 2011, during which time the UN estimates more than 60,000 people have been killed.

Russia also endorsed a speech by Assad where he offered an end to the crisis by calling national elections and forming a new government.

In his first public speech in six months last week, the dictator urged Syrians to mobilise in a 'war to defend the nation'.

His defiant call to arms came in an hour-long speech to cheering loyalists in the opera house in the capital Damascus.

Assad unveiled what he claimed was a peace initiative to end the violent uprising against his rule.

But he declared he would not talk to those he called extremists ‘who only understand the language of terrorism’ or to ‘puppets’ of the West.

People gather at a site hit by what activists said was missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet from forces loyal to Syrian president Assad, at the souk of Azaz, north of Aleppo, on Sunday

Meanwhile, as the death toll continued to grow steadily in Syria, an aid agency working in the conflict zone has said that doctors are being murdered to stop the wounded getting treated.

In a report released by International Rescue Committee's Commission on Syrian Refugees, they said that partner organisations which provide emergency medical services and supplies say the health care system has been decimated.

Physicians described 'intimidation, torture and the targeted killing of doctors and other medical staff in retribution for treating the wounded'.
