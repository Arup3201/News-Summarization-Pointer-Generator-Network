Declining: Less than half the adult population in England and Wales are now married, according to figures

Less than half of the adult population is now married, figures confirmed for the first time yesterday.

The watershed for marriage is the 
culmination of 30 years during which cohabitation has become the norm 
and successive governments have ceased to offer tax breaks, legal 
privileges or state approval to the married.

Figures from the Office for National 
Statistics showed that 21.6million of the 44.9million adults who live in
 England and Wales are married – 48.4 per cent of the population.

The number of those who have never tied the knot has doubled since the 1970s.

The statistics also highlight the rise of the so-called freemale, revealing that almost one in three women have never wed.

Nearly eight million women live the 
single life or opt for informal cohabiting relationships rather than 
have a husband and family.

The ONS said many of the freemales were women
 in their 20s and 30s, who have achieved a better standard of education 
than boys and have gone on in ever greater numbers to pursue careers.

Married people first appeared to fall 
into a minority three years ago, but ONS analysts insisted the numbers 
were misleading, saying they failed to take into account large numbers 
who marry abroad.

A graph shows how those who are single, divorced or widowed are now outnumbering the proportion of married adults in England and Wales

Further data shows that the number of adult females who are widowed has increased at a much higher rate than males

The new count, however, which sets out
 the married population in the middle of last year, does include 
estimates of those who married before migrating to Britain, or while 
living as expats abroad, or as tourists away on holiday.

The ONS presented the decline of 
marriage as less swift in England than elsewhere. ‘The proportion of the
 adult population of England and Wales who are married is one of the 
highest in Europe,’ it said.

The estimates said 21,643,000 are 
husbands or wives, while there are just under 16million single people 
who have never married and just over 3.1million divorcees.

The remainder
 is made up of widows or widowers.

The combined count of never-married 
and divorced people amounts to nearly 46 per cent of the population and 
at current rates will overtake the married population within a few 
years.

Cohabitation is fuelling the 
destruction of the family while separations and divorces have brought 
suffering and loneliness, the Vatican said yesterday. It declared that 
Catholic couples should not set up home together before marriage.
