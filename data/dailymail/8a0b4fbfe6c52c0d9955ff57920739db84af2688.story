When a barrel of glowing green radioactive ooze was spilt into the sewers of New York City and landed on four lost pet turtles, it spawned 'the world's most fearsome fighting team'.

However the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have yet to be spotted fighting crime in Philadelphia, where a man checking out a sinkhole in a street saw something unexpected inside â€” a pool of what looked like green ooze.

Steven Reitz said the sinkhole opened in the Northern Liberties section of the city last week and the ooze appeared several days later.

He said when he and some friends spotted the green pool, they didnâ€™t know what to make of it.

'We kind of walked over and looked and saw the neon green and said, "Whoa, look at that",' said Mr Reitz.

He was right to be concerned, for where there is green ooze, according to the seminal Eighties and early-Nineties cartoon and comic book series, there may well be mutants.

According to the Turtles storyline, green ooze was poured into the sewers by the evil ninja villain Shredder in an attempt to poison his honourable ninja rival Master Yoshi, who was living there after his exile from the Foot Clan.

But the plan only half worked and Yoshi was transformed into an anthropomorphic rat, and four turtles he had discovered and taken as pets to become humanoid themselves.

Yoshi adopts the four mutant amphibians as his sons and trains them in the art of ninjutsu, whereupon they vow to take revenge on Shredder and halt his criminal career.

The hole had been boarded up by the time Mr Reitz checked it again later that day, he said, adding that similar sinkholes appear every year and appear to be moving down the road.

Gary Burlingame, director of labs for the Philadelphia Water Department, said the colouring is simply dye, which helps workers determine the origins of sinkholes.

Workers pour the dye into flowing water underground, he said, then go to a manhole down the street and look into it.

If they see the color they poured into the system, they know the water is flowing in that direction.

Mr Burlingame stressed the dye is safe, non-toxic and biodegradable.
