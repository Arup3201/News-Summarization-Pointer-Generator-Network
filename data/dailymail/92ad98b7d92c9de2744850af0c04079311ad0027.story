The View chat show is in chaos after producers hopeful that conservative Meghan McCain might join the team turned down the offer.

The conservative pundit and daughter of Senator John McCain appeared as a guest co-host on The View earlier this month as part of a tryout to join the talk show.

After losing all their co-hosts except for Whoopi Goldberg, the show is in turmoil as they struggle to find suitable replacements.

No-show: Meghan McCain has turned down the opportunity to become a permanent co-host on The View

Trying it out: Meghan McCain was a guest co-host on the show earlier this month

Barbara Walters retired, Sherri Shepherd moved on after seven years and Jenny McCarthy left the show after just one season.

McCain, 29, is currently a panelist on Pivot’s TakePart Live and had appeared on The View several times in the past few years, most recently as a guest co-host in 2013.

“Network execs really wanted her. She was going to be their ‘new’ Elisabeth Hasselbeck because of her Republican stance, but with a much younger reach and more open stance on social issues,' a TV insider told Radar Online.

Meghan turned down the gig. Although she enjoys the occasional guest appearance, the source claimed she it's not something she wanted to do full time as she enjoys her current job at TakePart Live.

There were rumors she could have been taking the place of Elisabeth Hasselbeck who is seen as the shows' conservative voice to contrast the views of her more liberal co-hosts, Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O’Donnell.

Unlike Hasselbeck, who now co-hosts Fox & Friends, McCain views herself as more progressive than her fellow Republicans.

The talk show is undergoing a host of changes since co-host and executive producer Barbara Walters retired earlier this year.

Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy were let go from the show, leaving Goldberg the sole remaining full-time panelist in the wake of Walters’ departure.
