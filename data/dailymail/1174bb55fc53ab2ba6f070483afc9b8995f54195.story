A group of gipsies are objecting to the expansion of a traveller site and have started a 'not in our back yard' petition.

Travellers living at the Cae Garw gipsy and traveller site in Margam, near Port Talbot, South Wales, have contacted council chiefs to complain about plans to expand the site by 11 caravans.

There are already 20 pitches on the site, but the Welsh Government has given Neath Port Talbot Council money to expand the site and make more room for travellers.

The expansion, which is yet to be given the green light, is set to include 11 new pitches, amenity blocks and 'informal play areas'.

The council was given funding to carry out the works earlier this year and must purchase adjacent farm land to accommodate the extended site boundary.

Residents at Cae Garw said there was a divide over the council plans between those who had been there for decades and newcomers.

One elderly resident said there would be an exodus to local car parks in protest at the expansion, if it went ahead.

He told MailOnline: 'Most people here are happy with the way things are and don't want this changed.

'This site is already overcrowded and expanding it will only attract more people, it's like an advertisement.

'If it goes ahead people will be heading for Port Talbot and setting up in the first car park they come to. That's what I'll be doing.

'We have lived here since it opened 30 years ago, a lot of people have, but this will drive them back to their old way of life.'

He added: 'If this expansion happens there will be overcrowding at local schools and at the doctors. It's disgraceful.

'The council would be better off saving its money. We are happy with things the way they are.'

Rob Jones, a councillor in Margam, said: 'If you live in a lovely, countryside area, in a close-knit community, would you want strangers coming in?'

Jeffrey Jones, another long term resident at the site, said: 'It's not a question of the people, it's the space.

'How would these councillors suddenly like a lot of houses built opposite where they live? Nobody wants that.'

But mother-of-seven Lucy Price, 30, originally from Ireland, welcomed the expansion plans.

She said: 'I know some people here are against this but they tend to be the older generation.

'People here with families support the expansion. The children would like to see a park built as well.

'I think more people should be able to come here if they want. There are more people for this than against.'

Rob Jones, a councillor in Margam, said he has been approached by about a third of the travellers who live at the site and object to the council's plans.

He told MailOnline: 'I have been approached by some members of the community that don't want an expansion on the site.

'Out of the residents on the site, there are about a third that are vehemently opposed to any expansion.

'They are closed communities, very family-orientated and about a third are not supportive to the point that they are trying to start a petition to prevent the council from going ahead.

'About another third are not bothered one way or another what happens, while another third would encourage more travellers to the site.' 

He agreed that those who object to the expansion of the site are against it because they are worried about new travellers disrupting the camp.

He said: 'People think gipsies come and go, but there are some at the site which have been there for more than 40 years.

'They are entrenched there. If you live in a lovely, countryside area, in a close-knit community, would you want strangers coming in? I think that's the perception they have.

'They are all related or close friends, they don't want people to come in and disrupt the harmony.

'They don't want bad neighbours, to put it simply.

'There's sometimes a fear of the unknown. Their fear is that if someone bad turns up then it would cause problems on the site.'

Mr Jones said the expansion of the site would occur over the next 15 years, if given the go-ahead.

Gareth Nutt, director of environment at Neath Port Talbot Council, said there was a need for additional pitches up to 2026 and confirmed a consultation process has been launched.

He said: 'This planning application proposes the provision of additional pitches as a means to address this proposed need.'
