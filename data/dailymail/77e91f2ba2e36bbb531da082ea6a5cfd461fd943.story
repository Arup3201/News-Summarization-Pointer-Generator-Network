A Melbourne father is dead and his five-year-old daughter is in a critical condition after their light plane crashed into a home shortly after take-off yesterday afternoon.

Peter Doutch, 44, and his daughter Emily, 5, took off on the recreational flight from Tyabb Airport in the city's southeast about 5.20pm yesterday.

The plane stalled minutes into the flight and crashed into a Seaview Road home just 2km away from the airport.

Tragic: Peter Doutch died in the plane crash in Melbourne while his daughter Emily, five, survived but is critically ill in hospital

Neighbour Kevin Paganoni witnessed the crash and told the Herald Sun he found the little girl in the wreckage as fuel leaked from the aircraft.

'She was calling out and crying a fair bit… she was badly cut up and I lifted her out and put her on the bloke’s lawn and we wrapped her in a blanket. It was pretty scary all right,' Mr Paganoni said.

The plane clipped the roof of the home before smashing into the side of the house, another witness, Rob Boer, told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'It was spitting and coughing like it was running out of fuel,' Mr Boer said.

'It wasn’t lined up with the runway. It was a couple of hundred metres off the line they usually come in on, so we knew something was wrong straight away.'

The shocked owners of the home weren’t inside when the crash occurred but said they heard an 'almighty crash' – they had been outside saying goodbye to their children just minutes before.

The couple rushed to help comfort and treat the young girl until paramedics and police arrived.

Emily suffered head injuries and remains in a critical condition after being airlifted to the Royal Children’s Hospital where her mother Sue spent the night by her bedside.

Devoted father: Mr Doutch had taken his daughter for a recreational flight when the accident happened. He is believed to have died on impact

The girl’s helmet had been knocked off by the impact of the crash, according to Mr Boer.

Police said Mr Doutch was declared dead at the scene and most likely died on impact.

Mr Doutch, who worked as a Victorian State Emergency Service volunteer for 20 years, has been described as 'a true, dedicated volunteer'.

'Everyone’s just in shock. He was a very happy go-lucky guy,' Frankston SES controller Brian McMannis said.

Teachers at John Paul College are currently supporting Emily’s older brother Daniel.

'We are absolutely devastated by the tragedy of the event,' Principal Jane Tibb said.

'And certainly (we will) offer support to the family on an ongoing basis as they deal with this absolute disaster.'

Investigators are travelling from Brisbane to inspect the crash site before debris is removed from the house.

A report is being prepared for the coroner.
