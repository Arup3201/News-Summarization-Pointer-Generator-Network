Laura Robson looks set to make her return to action after a 14-month absence with a wrist injury after being given a wildcard into the qualifying event for next month's Miami Open.

The former British No 1's last appearance was more than a year ago in the Australian Open when she went down 6-3, 6-0 to Belgian 18th seed Kirsten Flipkens in under an hour.

Robson shelved plans to make her comeback in February at a low-key event in Arizona.

The 21-year-old had been considering a return at a $25,000 (£16,400) lower-tier tournament at a place called Surprise starting next Monday.

Robson was struggling with wrist problems from late 2013 onwards and in late April of 2014 underwent surgery, putting her in a cast for the rest of the summer.

She was able to return to training and practice later on last year, working mostly in Florida, but as with all wrist injuries in tennis it has proved a tediously long process, and the watchword has always been caution.
