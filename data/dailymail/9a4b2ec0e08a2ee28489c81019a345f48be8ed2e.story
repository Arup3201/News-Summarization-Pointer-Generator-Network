A driver has been jailed for four years after leaving his friend to die at the side of the road after he was thrown from his car in a head-on smash.

James Maughan, 20, was driving a Suzuki 4x4 when he failed to stop at a road junction and smashed into an oncoming VW Golf.

The impact caused his passenger Travis O’Neil, who was riding in the back without a seatbelt, to be thrown from the car.

But as witnesses gathered to give 19-year-old Mr O’Neil first aid, Maughan reversed his 4x4 off a grass verge and drove away.

Scene: Maughan was behind the wheel when he crashed his Suzuki 4x4 into a VW Golf in Sheffield. Mr O'Neil was in the backseat without a seat-belt and was thrown from the car

The 4x4, bought by Mr O’Neil earlier 
that day, was later found burned out, prosecutor Michael Rawlinson told 
Sheffield Crown Court.

Mr O’Neil, whose girlfriend Chelsea Lynch was expecting a baby, was rushed to hospital but died from his injuries an hour later.

In a victim impact statement read out in court Miss Lynch said: 'How am I going to explain to my daughter she has to grow up without a daddy?'

Maughan was due to stand trial but changed his plea to guilty to causing death by dangerous driving last November.

Mr Rawlinson told the court the junction was clearly marked but he went straight across, spun out of control and hit a road sign.

Maughan, of no fixed address and who has a three-year-old daughter, claimed he abandoned the vehicle nearby and did not set it on fire.

Serious injuries: Maughan fled the scene of the crash, leaving Mr O'Neil lying on the road. Witnesses called an ambulance but Mr O'Neil died an hour later in hospital

He handed himself in to police after a public appeal for information following the smash on Arbourthorne Road, Sheffield.

He told police he blamed NHS support worker June Jones who was driving the Golf for the crash.

The public gallery was packed as family and relatives of both Travis and Maughan waited for the sentence.

Michael Blakey, defending, said: 'Travis was his close friend, he is devastated and it will live with him for the rest of his life. He apologises.'

While awaiting the court case in July this year Maughan was jailed for 13 months for possessing an imitation offensive weapon.

He also admitted assaulting a prison warder with a pan of hot water while in custody.

Recorder David Gordon sent him to a young offenders’ institution for four years and banned him from driving for five years.

He will serve at least half of his detention. The judge told him: 'You will have to live with this on your conscience for the rest of your life.'

Sentenced: Maughan had denied the charge but changed his plea to guilty at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured
