Tripling tobacco taxes could prevent 200 million deaths worldwide and cut smoking by a third, a study has claimed.

Researchers say the tax hike would deter young people from starting to smoke, and encourage smokers to quit completely rather than just switch to a cheaper brand.

In most high-income countries, up to 60 per cent of the price of a pack of cigarettes is tax - whereas in most low and middle-income countries, tax accounts for up to 40 per cent of the cost.

Tripling tobacco taxes could prevent 200 million deaths worldwide and cut smoking by a third, a study has claimed

The research - carried out by Cancer Research UK - reviewed 63 studies on the causes and consequences of tobacco use in different countries.

Study co-author Professor Sir Richard Peto said: 'The two certainties in life are death and taxes. We want higher tobacco taxes and fewer tobacco deaths. 

'It would help children not to start, and it would help many adults to stop while there's still time.

'Globally, about half of all young men and one in 10 of all young women become smokers, and, particularly in developing countries, relatively few quit.

'If they keep smoking, about half will be killed by it, but if they stop before 40, they'll reduce their risk of dying from tobacco by 90 per cent.'

He added: 'The international tobacco industry makes about £30 billion in profits each year - that's a profit of approximately £6,000 per death from smoking.'

Research
 has shown that a 50 per cent higher inflation-adjusted price for 
cigarettes reduces tobacco consumption by about a fifth, with the 
biggest impact on the young and poor.

As well as cutting consumption by a third, tripling tobacco taxes would also increase global government revenues from tobacco by a third, from £180 billion a year to £240 billion, said the researchers.

In the European Union, a doubling of cigarette prices would prevent 100,000 deaths a year in the under 70s, they added.

The findings are reported in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: 'Worldwide, around half a billion children and adults under the age of 35 are already - or soon will be - smokers, and many will be hooked on tobacco for life.

'So there's an urgent need for Governments to find ways to stop people starting and to help smokers give up.

'This immensely important study demonstrates that tobacco taxes are a hugely powerful lever, and potentially a triple win - reducing the numbers of people who smoke and who die from their addiction, reducing the health care burden and costs associated with smoking and yet, at the same time, increasing government income.

'We urge all governments, not least the UK Government, to take action by regularly raising tobacco taxes above inflation, and using occasional steep tax hikes starting with the next budget.'
