Hitting out: Heather Wolfson, who has two grown-up children, believes her 35-year teaching career is now over and feels her reputation has been destroyed

A dedicated teacher last night claimed her  35-year career was in ruins after she lost her job for handing out her mobile phone number to a schoolgirl who was upset about her sick grandfather.

Heather Wolfson, 56, said she had been using ‘a mother’s instinct’ when she  helped the pupil, adding that political correctness meant teachers were being punished for simply showing compassion and common sense.

The mother of two was suspended from her job last year at Ysgol y Grango, in Rhos, north Wales. The school said  Mrs Wolfson had acted inappropriately by giving the girl  her number when she broke down in tears after her grandfather’s diagnosis with cancer.

The food technology and textiles teacher was also reprimanded for giving her number to a 12-year-old boy and offering to take him home after dark when no-one arrived to collect him from school.

Neither of the children’s parents complained to the school. Instead, a member of staff alerted the headteacher that the girl and boy had the teacher’s phone number.

At a disciplinary hearing Mrs Wolfson, who had been on a fixed-term contract to cover maternity leave, was handed a written warning.

Her contract expired the following day and was not renewed.

The school gave her a basic dated reference, but the experience is proving a blot on an otherwise untainted career.

Mrs Wolfson, from Weston Rhyn, near Oswestry, said she has been struggling to get a job ever since.

Under a cloud: Mrs Wolfson was suspended from her fixed-term contract with Ysgol y Grango, in Rhos, north Wales, and has never reinstated

‘I’ve given my life to teaching but 
now I’ve been rendered unemployable,’ she said. ‘Schools have fallen 
prey to political correctness and our careers are walking on a 
tightrope.’

Referring to the incidents with the 
pupils which triggered her suspension, she said: ‘I was just looking out
 for them both, it was a mother’s instinct.’ Colin Adkins, of the 
National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: 
‘Heather’s case is an absolute tragedy.

‘There are no regulations to say 
teachers can’t text pupils, the communication should simply be 
appropriate, and it was entirely appropriate in  this case.

‘She was providing pastoral support. There was nothing sinister or untoward going on.’

Amanda Harrison, deputy head of Ysgol
 y Grango, said the matter had been resolved, adding: ‘It would be 
inappropriate to comment further.’

Wrexham Council also declined to comment.

Mrs Wolfson was suspended in January last year and her contract expired months later in July.

‘I would never have done anything to 
jeopardise my job,’ she said. ‘While I agree teachers and children need 
to be safeguarded, the impact often goes against your instinct which is 
to care for and protect the child.’

Local councillors in Rhos have refused to comment, but Mrs Wolfson has been backed by teaching union NASUWT
