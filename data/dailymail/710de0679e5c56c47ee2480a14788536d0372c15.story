It is a helmet any Top Gun would be proud to wear - and the most advanced fighter jet system ever created.

BAE Systems Strike II helmet-mounted display, unveiled at the Farnborough Air Show, boasts everything from a wraparound HD display in its visor to a built in night vision system.

This next-generation HMD also includes a cutting-edge tracking system that ensures the pilot’s exact head position and the aircraft computer system are continuously in sync.

BAE Systems Striker II has integrated night vision cameras, and know exactly where a pilot is looking

The Striker II has a tiny digital camera which turns night into day for pilots using a sensor mounted in the middle of the helmet.

It projects an image on to the pilot’s visor in 1280x1060 high-definition resolution, along with other critical information such as speed, weapons and target.

The Striker II also tracks the position of the helmet and projects the information on to a pilot’s visor.

This means that no matter where the pilot looks, they still see the data in the same place.

'As the industry transitions from analogue to digital display solutions, Striker II brings a superior, fully digital capability to multiple platform types,' said Joseph Senftle, vice president and general manager for Communications and Controls Solutions at BAE Systems.

'Designed to address evolving mission requirements with advanced digital night vision technology, our new HMD was built to be ‘future proof’ and seamlessly adaptable to technology advancements in the years ahead.'

Instead of night vision goggles, the Striker II has a digital night vision camera inside the helmet, which helps reduce g-force effects on the pilot's head and neck to improve comfort, and eliminates the need to change equipment at night.

The Striker II is a fully digital helmet which has target tracking technology within a fully integrated visor-projected HMD system.

The Striker II tracking system eliminates any delay in determining where the pilot is looking and can therefore perfectly position datav onto the visor.

It also includes a cutting-edge tracking system that ensures the pilot’s exact head position and the aircraft computer system are continuously in sync, reducing problems common to other HMDs.

The Striker II tracking system eliminates any delay in determining where the pilot is looking and can therefore perfectly position symbology onto the visor.

'The results are high-precision target tracking and engagement as well as superior situational awareness and mission effectiveness,' the firm says.
