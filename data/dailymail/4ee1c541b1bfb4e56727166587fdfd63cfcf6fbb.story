If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from the internet, it’s that domestic cats are curious about their surroundings.

There are hundreds of online videos of felines investigating everything from treadmills to printers.

And their big cousins on the African savannah are just as inquisitive.

Evidence for this has arrived in the form of a video in which a cheetah wanders up to the GoPro camera filming it – and licks the lens.

The footage has gone viral, with over 130,000 views so far.

The HD Hero3 camera had been placed on the ground by wildlife expert Matthew Copham, from Safari Footprints, and pointed towards two cheetahs resting near a bush.

At the start of the footage one them wanders slowly over to the camera and begins sniffing it. 

And after a few seconds it lies down and gives it a good lick. Perhaps it thought it would taste good – or maybe the spot clean was carried out over concern there was some dirt on the lens that would ruin shots of it looking magnificent.

After all, we also know that cats take their looks very seriously.

After a short time something appears to spook the cheetah, though, and it suddenly gets up, turns and sprints back to its friend.

In the wild cheetahs are found in Africa and Iran, with their name deriving from the Hindi word Chita – which translates as ‘the spotted one’.

They are, of course, famed for their speed – and have been clocked hitting 70mph for short bursts.

This means that their favoured prey of gazelles, impalas, antelopes and birds often don’t stand a chance of escape.
