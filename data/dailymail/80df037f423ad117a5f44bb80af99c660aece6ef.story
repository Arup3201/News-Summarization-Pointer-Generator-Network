Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno has spoken for the first time on the news of his old rival David Letterman's planned retirement next year.

The comedian opened up about the news by joking: 'Oh well you know, he and I [are] gonna do The Sunshine Boys on Broadway, so we're very excited about that.'

Letterman announced that he was to retire as host of the Late Show next year, after 22 years at its helm, at the taping of the show last Thursday afternoon.

When asked who he thinks should replace the beloved host, Leno told Extra: 'I don't know a lot of good people out there.'

The two had been rivals since NBC picked Leno over Letterman to replace Johnny Carson as the host of the Tonight Show in 1992, resulting in a public and bitter feud.

Letterman left the network for its competitor CBS, and launched his own talk show in the same timeslot as Tonight, going head-to-head with Leno and initially beating him in the ratings.

Leno, 63, hosted his last Tonight Show after 22 years in February, before handing over the reins to comedian Jimmy Fallon, scoring his highest ratings in 15 years with an impressive 14.6million viewers.

And with Fallon doing so well as the Tonight Show host, NBC's boss on Monday expressed no fear about who will replace Letterman upon his planned retirement.

NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke declared Fallon 'is the best and no matter who CBS puts in that place, I think he'll still be the best'.

The NBC chief said he didn't think 
Tina Fey or Leno himself, two people with NBC ties who have been 
mentioned as potential Letterman replacements, would be in the running.

Fallon
 has topped the late-night ratings since taking over from Leno, and is particularly strong among the young audience NBC seeks.

While the network was 
always confident in Fallon, Burke said the new host has easily exceeded 
expectations, and is even bringing viewers back to the 11:30pm time 
slot.

Announcing his retirement next year, Letterman thanked the network and his fans last Thursday.

During the taping, Letterman announced he
 had informed CBS Corporation's president Leslie Moonves that he will 
step down as host in 2015, when his current contract expires.

'The
 man who owns this network, Leslie Moonves, he and I have had a 
relationship for years and years and years, and we have had this 
conversation in the past, and we agreed that we would work together on 
this circumstance and the timing of this circumstance,' Letterman said.

'I
 phoned him just before the program, and I said "Leslie, it’s been 
great, you’ve been great, and the network has been great, but I’m 
retiring".

'I just want to 
reiterate my thanks for the support from the network, all of the people 
who have worked here, all of the people in the theater, all the people 
on the staff, everybody at home, thank you very much.

'What this means now, is that Paul and I 
can be married,' he added, in reference to his music director Paul Shaffer, as his announcement was greeted with a 
standing ovation at the Ed Sullivan Theater.

Letterman did not give a date for his departure, saying only that it would be in 'the not too distant future, 2015'.

 appearing on Thursday's show commented on the announcement, with Johnny
 Depp telling Letterman: 'You have a lot of weepers back there.'

Letterman, 66, who is also a television and film producer, has been at the helm of the CBS show for 20 years, before which he hosted NBC's Late Night for 11 years.

He has been the only Late Show host, and was responsible for creating the show, which has won several Emmys, in 1993.

One of the most memorable Emmys awarded to the show was for its first broadcast after the September 11 terror attacks.

It was hailed by the New York Daily News as 'one of the purest, most honest and important moments in TV history', according to CBS.

Apart from a short stint by Bill Cosby, who took over hosting while Letterman recovered from heart surgery in 2000, the Late Show has always had Letterman at its helm.

The award-winning host is the longest-serving late-night talk show host in TV history - having been in the role for 31 years.
