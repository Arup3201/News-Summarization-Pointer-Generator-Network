A pair of teenage twin girls have been banned from a market town for repeatedly causing mayhem over a three-year period.

The 18-year-old pair are not allowed to enter West Mallingâ€™s historic centre after being handed a two-year Asbo by magistrates.

Sevenoaks Magistrates court heard that Chelsea Shannon Scott and her twin sister Leonie Vicky Scott, of Eccles, caused a repeated nuisance and committing numerous public order offences in the West Malling and Aylesford areas.

After hearing of a litany of offences which have occurred over the past three years, including assault on police officers, criminal damage, shoplifting and harassment, the magistrates granted the Asbo, which runs from May 9, 2012, to May 8, 2014.

The order bans the twin girls from entering West Malling town centre, Eaton Place in Larkfield and Tesco in Lunsford Park, Aylesford.

The Asbo also prohibits the pair from being a passenger in a car driven by their friend Amee Keller-Bond, except on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday between 6am and 9pm.

After the hearing, Chief Inspector Jon Kirby said: 'Anti-Social Behaviour Orders are served to protect the public from individuals who repeatedly cause a nuisance.

'Hopefully, by granting this Asbo, it will make the Scott twins realise the consequences of their actions.

'It limits their freedom to enter the town of West Malling, Eaton Place and Tesco in Larkfield, which will hopefully deter future offending.

'Such offences are a blight on the town of West Malling and I and my colleagues are committed to clamping down on such nuisance behaviour, wherever it occurs.

'We want to enforce acceptable levels of behaviour and take action against the minority of people who are intent on intimidating or harassing others.

'This Anti-Social Behaviour Order should deal with the pattern of behaviour they have displayed over the past 3 years and hopefully break this cycle of offending'.
