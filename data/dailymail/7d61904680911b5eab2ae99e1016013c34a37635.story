David Moyes' misery at Manchester United was compounded further at the weekend as he watched his side crash out of the FA Cup in the third round at home to Swansea.

Is former boss Sir Alex Ferguson - now a director watching matches from the stands - an unwanted distraction too? And will Swansea upset them again when they meet in the league on Saturday?

What about Sam Allardyce - will he be the next Premier League manager to go? The beleaguered West Ham boss faces yet another testing week following Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup humiliation at Nottingham Forest.
