Several members of  England’s Euro 2012 squad travelled to the Auschwitz death camp yesterday.

Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart were among those who toured the gas chambers, while the rest of the squad stayed closer to their Krakow base to visit the enamel factory where Oskar Schindler protected Jews from the SS and Gestapo.

Hart, Rooney and the national team manager Roy Hodgson were joined by Leighton Baines, Theo Walcott, Andy Carroll, Jack Butland and Phil Jagielka, as well as former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who lost 15 members of his family at the camp.

Everton defender Jagielka, whose grandparents were Polish, said parts of the visit left him fighting back tears.

‘To round people up like cattle and bring them to a place just to be killed – I don’t think I can find a word to describe that,’ he said.

‘I think the worst moment for me was when we went to see the suitcases of the victims and you saw the age difference of those who died – anything from 60 years to three years old.’

Goalkeeper Hart added: ‘It is the scale of the place that hits you, the numbers that walked through those gates with absolutely no hope of survival. When we went to see the place where the bodies were cremated, we were told 90 per cent of those who walked through that door were dead within the hour.’

England's visit to the camp is part of an ongoing partnership with the Holocaust Educational Trust

Holocaust survivors Zigi Shipper and Ben Helfgott both addressed England's players before they left for Poland last week.

'I've
 never seen a room so silent and intense,' the goalkeeper said, 'people 
hanging off every word as these guys spoke about what they did, and what
 their end message was.

'There was no hate. They weren't angry. They just had that message of how you can be a better person.

'I couldn't get over them, the two guys. They were amazing.

'They spoke at the end about what roles we have as footballers and what sort of message we can hand out.

'It got me. It was great to speak to them. I just wanted to thank them for coming in. Two amazing people.'

Defender Joleon Lescott was one of 14 
players to visit the factory and said: 'Days like today you tend to look
 back on as much as the tournament itself in years to come, the things 
you have done, the people you have met.

'I am sure, in years to come, the tournament will be a highlight but so will visiting places like this.

'It
 is fresh in my mind at the moment so it might take a while for it to 
sink in. I will go back to the hotel and think about what has been said 
to us by the guide.

'Most
 youngsters today have a glorified image of a ghetto but the ghettos we 
have learned about today are not like that. I did not have a full 
understanding of what the word means.'

The national team manager Roy Hodgson wore his sombre blue England suit, while his players appeared more casual in polo shirts and trainers.

Earlier this week, Italian players visited Auschwitz in tracksuits, while the Dutch team opted for faded jeans and trainers. The Auschwitz Museum advises visitors: ‘On the Museum grounds, visitors should behave with the appropriate solemnity and respect. Dress should be appropriate for a place of this nature.’

However, last night the FA said the players had been advised to wear ‘more comfortable clothing’ due to the six-hour round trip between Auschwitz and their base in Krakow.

They were also told that training shoes would help them on the ‘uneven’ ground.The rest of the squad made the shorter journey to the enamel factory in Krakow made famous by the film Schindler’s List.

‘The players made it clear which of them wanted to go to Auschwitz,’ said one FA source. ‘It was left completely up to them as to which trip they decided to go on.’

The visit to Auschwitz, organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust, took place after two Holocaust survivors spoke to the squad in England before they flew to Poland earlier this week. At the end of the guided tour, FA chairman David Bernstein and Hodgson donned skull caps and lit candles in memory of the dead.

Mr Grant's father, Meir Granat, was 
just a teenager when his father decided to uproot his family and flee 
their hometown of Mlawa, Poland in 1937.

Meir's
 father Avram, feared that something terrible would happen and took his 
wife and nine of their ten children on a three-year trek to find safety -
 across Poland, into the horrors of the Warsaw camp and eventually to a 
remote forest in Russia.

According
 to an interview with the BBC, Grant explained that one child, Hertsel, 
was hidden in a monastery, Rachel and Estera were placed in 
an orphanage and the rest were constantly moved around Eastern Europe in
 search of safety.

Two of Grant's
 father's 
siblings - Koppel & Hannah - were pulled from their train when it 
stopped and were never seen again. He later discovered that both died at
 Auschwitz.

The rest of his father's family along
 with many other Jews were taken by train deep into Russia's wilderness 
and offloaded to die in temperatures as low as -40C.

His father's sister Sarah, aged 15, was the first to die after eating poisonous mushrooms. 
Sarah was the first of seven family members Meir was forced to bury, digging their graves with his own hands. He also buried his own mother and father.

Grant first visited the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, where members of his family died, in 1988 and returns each year with
 Holocaust survivors for the 'March of the Living'. He told the BBC 
however that his father Meir, who died in October 2009, never went back 
to Poland, because he couldn't face it.

Yesterday saw the first games of Euro 2012 take place, hours after the Dutch team said they were subjected to racist chanting as they trained in Krakow. UEFA has told referees to stop matches if racist chants persist.

The story of Oskar Schindler, whose factory was visited by many of the England squad, has been told in a novel and a Hollywood blockbuster movie.

The ethnic German industrialist, born in Moravia, is credited with saving more than 1,100 Jews during the Second World War.

He shielded Jewish workers from the Nazis by employing them in his enamelware and ammunitions factories.

Schindler was a regular guest at Nazi SS parties from the early stages of the war, but increasingly protected his Jewish staff as Hitler's anti-Semitic extermination campaign progressed.

He was appalled when many of his workers were rounded up and killed in a 1943 raid on a Jewish ghetto in Krakow.

He later sought to use all his powers of persuasion to shield workers from deportation and death.

One such occasion is recounted by author Eric Silver in The Book of the Just: The Unsung Heroes Who Rescued Jews from Hitler.

'Two Gestapo men came to his office and demanded that he hand over a family of five who had bought forged Polish identity papers,' Silver wrote.

'"Three hours after they walked in," Schindler said, "two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded".'

Germany classed Schindler's factory as a 'business essential to the war effort', which enabled him to claim exemptions for his workers whenever they were threatened with deportation.

Wives, children and the handicapped were shown to be necessary mechanics and metalworkers.

Schindler died in October 1974 aged 66. His protection of Jews was reimagined in Thomas

Keneally's 1982 novel Schindler's Ark and Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning 1993 film Schindler's List.
