This video shows the moment a United Nations special envoy was forced to take refuge after being threatened at gunpoint by ten to 15 men and told to leave the Crimea region of Ukraine.

Dutch diplomat Robert Serry retreated into a café after the men told him they were under orders to take him to the airport and got into his car.

Crowds gathered outside the café, some armed and some in paramilitary uniform, chanting ‘Russia! Russia!’

Mr Serry was forced to cut short his mission to the disputed region after being ordered to leave, UN officials said.

Mr Serry was escorted out into a vehicle
 which was immediately surrounded by 100 demonstrators, some waving 
Russian flags and beating on the windows, before police pushed a way 
through and accompanied the vehicle to the airport.

After waiting in the café, Mr Serry was driven to Simferopol airport, according to Associated Press. He was later flown to Istanbul, Turkey.

In a statement, the former ambassador to Ukraine said: ‘I’m safe. My visit was interrupted for reasons that I cannot understand.’

ITV reporter James Mates and a camera
 crew, who were in the coffee shop with Mr Serry, were begged not to 
leave and told their presence would protect him.

His assistant, Ruth Sigalus, said: ‘No, no, no. Don’t leave. Please.’ And Mr Serry told them: ‘Appreciate you being here.’

ITV News reported that some of the men who had threatened him outside the café were dressed in paramilitary uniform, and some were armed.

Speaking after being escorted away from the area to the airport, Mr Serry told ITV: ‘I think this incident is just an example of how serious the situation has become.

‘And my hope is that everybody will realise that the situation is very urgent now - to find a way to deescalate the tensions here.’
