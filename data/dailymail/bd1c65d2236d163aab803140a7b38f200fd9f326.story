When three divers set out to film the amazing sea-life off the coast of an island in the French Polynesia they captured more than they hoped for. 

Despite beautiful footage showing them swimming among some of the ocean's most dazzling inhabitants, it was a humpback whale who turned up to make a surprising starring appearance.

The divers were filming off the coast of Moorea, in the French Polynesia. You can even hear the sound of the whale as it approaches.

These sequences of moans, howls and cries are complex and often continue for hours on end. 

Scientists have studied these sounds to decipher their means. 

It is most likely that these humpbacks sing to communicate with each other and to attract mates.

Humpback whales are normally found near coastlines feeding on tiny shrimp-like krill, plankton and small fish. 

They migrate annually from summer feeding grounds near the poles to warmer winter breeding waters closer to the Equator.
