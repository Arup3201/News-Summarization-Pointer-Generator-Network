Star arrival: Jude Law was rushed into the Old Bailey to give evidence for the prosecution at the hacking trial in January

Jude Law was betrayed by a relative who sold information about his girlfriend’s affair with Daniel Craig, a court heard yesterday.

It was only during yesterday’s proceedings that Law learned that the immediate family member was paid by the News of the World for details of the actor’s showdown with the James Bond star after Craig’s fling with Sienna Miller.

In a dramatic moment at the Old Bailey, Law, 41, was handed a folded piece of paper containing the relative’s name and was asked if he knew they had spoken to the newspaper in 2005.

His voice cracked slightly as he said he had come to know about it several years later, but had not known they had been paid.

‘I’m confused about what you are saying,’ he told Timothy Langdale, the QC defending former News of the World editor Andy Coulson in the phone hackling trial. ‘Are you asking whether I was aware of people being paid to get information? I wasn’t aware of it.’

Asked when he first heard his relative had taken money from the tabloid, he replied: ‘Today.’

The father of four appeared shaken as he was asked if he knew that his relative and others around him were paid to talk to the tabloid.

The relative was said to have sold details about Law’s phone call to Craig, after he discovered the 007 actor’s affair with his then girlfriend Miss Miller.

In an angry transatlantic call, Law was said to have berated Craig and demanded he should tell his own girlfriend, film producer Satsuki Mitchell, about his infidelity.

Law said he had known Craig for ‘many, many years’ before he learned of the affair, which was made public a month after the phone call in a News of the World front page headlined ‘Sienna cheats on Jude’.

In an awkward courtroom exchange, he agreed he had called his fellow actor about the fling in 2005.Mr Langdale said: ‘I’m not going to ask you the detail but no doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?’

Affair: The Old Bailey heard that Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller, pictured together in Layer Cake, had a relationship and Jude Law called the James Bond star after he found out

Jude Law was asked about how the 2005 affair between Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig was revealed in the News of the World and if he knew a family member was secretly selling stories about him.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC (AE) to Jude Law (JL): 'When was the first time that you heard the suggestion that a member of your family had passed information to the News of the World for money?'

JL: 'Today.'

AE: 'Can you tell me when it was discovered a relative had been in conversation with the News of the World about this story?.

JL: 'That was in the autumn of last year, Initially it was from the (hacking) investigation, and when - confronted is too strong a word - a conversation was had with the relative they came up and admitted it had gone on.

'Admitted is maybe too strong a word, but I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.'

Timothy Langdale QC, (TL) defending Andy Coulson, asked Mr Law whether he knew about the affair in September 2005.

TL: 'Were you aware there had been or was some sort of relationship between them?'

JL: 'Yes, in and around that time, indeed I was.'

TL: 'Did you telephone Daniel Craig and speak to him about it, at a time when he was in Baltimore?

JL: 'Yes'

TL: 'No doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?  Did you make any reference to his then-girlfriend, somebody called Satsuki?'

JL: 'I did, yeah. I do not remember if that was her name - Saski - more than likely, yes. We had known each other for many, many years, so the conversation took on all sorts of turns.'

TL: 'You were not aware that a member of your immediate family was talking to the press, to the News of the World, about this story?'.

JL: 'No I was not aware of that'.

Mr Law was then handed a written note of the family member's name.

AE: 'It was been suggested part of the tale of the phone call
 to Daniel Craig came from sources close to you. Did you authorise that 
exercise?'

JL: 'No, in no way'.

‘I
 did, yeah,’ the Oscar-nominated actor replied. ‘We had known each other
 many, many years so the conversation took all sorts of turns.’

Mr
 Langdale asked if Law had told Craig to tell his own girlfriend about 
the fling. Law replied: ‘I think that’s correct, yes I think I did.’

He
 appeared disdainful when he was asked to look at the News of the World 
article about the affair. Mr Langdale told him: ‘I’m not going to ask 
you to read every word of it.’

Law replied: ‘I would rather not.’

In 
earlier evidence, Law described Miss Miller as ‘a friend’ who was his 
girlfriend for several years after his 2003 divorce from actress Sadie 
Frost.

He said Miss Miller had been the one to tell him that one of his 
entourage, a male employee, had been giving information about them to 
the News of the World.

But he said he was only told about his 
relative’s dealings with the paper by the police last year, and had 
spoken to the family member then.

He said: ‘When a conversation was had 
with the relative, they came and admitted what had gone on.

‘But as I said before, I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.’

The
 family member was not named in court and their identity was only 
revealed to two barristers and the judge.

Mr Langdale said the 
relative’s identity should be protected because they were a confidential
 journalistic source.

A second piece of paper was also handed to Law,
 containing the names of a publicist and the male employee who were said
 to have been selling stories to the tabloid.

He confirmed both names, 
but added: ‘I was never aware that any money had changed hands.’

Law
 said Press interest in his private life had increased dramatically 
after his Oscar nomination for The Talented Mr Ripley in 2001 and the 
subsequent breakdown of his marriage to Miss Frost.

He said he had 
suspected someone in his close circle was leaking information because 
photographers apparently knew where he would be, even when he made 
‘secret’ arrangements for days out with his children.

The jury has 
heard he was the victim of phone hacking and was targeted by News of the
 World private detective Glenn Mulcaire. Law said he was not surprised 
to learn he had been hacked, as he had long believed someone had an 
‘unhealthy’ knowledge of his life.

Coulson, 46, denies charges 
relating to phone hacking at the News of the World and alleged corrupt 
payments to officials.

Six other defendants, including his predecessor 
Rebekah Brooks, all deny charges against them.

The jury has heard that 
Mulcaire has pleaded guilty to conspiring to intercept voicemails.

The trial continues.

Coulson, right
