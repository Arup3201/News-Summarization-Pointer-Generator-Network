Social media reports claim Ms Olsen suffered racist bullying in the run up to her tragic death 

Mr Olsen and his wife Cindy travelled to China and adopted Emilie Grace and brought her home to Ohio agend nine months.

Speaking to Cincinnati.com, Mr Olsen said: 'I'm not saying the school did something wrong, but I am looking for answers.

'I'm not trying to stir the pot, and I know there are a lot of rumors out there, but I'm trying to get answers.'

Several posts on social media suggested that the 13-year-old school girl had been racially bullied. 

He said: 'There was a racial component to the bullying. There was cyber-bullying and physical bullying. They (school officials) cleared it up in the sixth grade, but it continued into the seventh grade. She was an A student, but she started to fail intentionally and talked about wanting to go to another school district to get away from it.'
