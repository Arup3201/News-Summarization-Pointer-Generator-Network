Young people barred from taking the dole for the first six months they are unemployed would consider taking their own lives, outspoken Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has warned.

The proposed changes would see under 30s stopped from getting unemployment benefits for six months to encourage them to try and find a job faster, but the Senator Lambie is concerned this would have implications on the mental health of the unemployed.

'They are losing their self-esteem and their self-respect and all it’s going to do is make these guys think about taking their own lives and [sic] won’t be responsible for that,' Ms Lambie told The Australian.

Palmer United Senator Jacqui Lambie will not support the Coalition's proposed changes to the work for the dole scheme

The outspoken Senator says she will never support the Abbott government's controversial budget move, even if the waiting time for under-30s to get the dole was reduced to a month.

'I will never support this. This will hurt the youth,' she said.

'All it’s going to do is create more paperwork for Centrelink who are understaffed already. And what’s one month off the dole going to do?'

'These guys are already feeling like a bucket of s**t,'’ she told The Australian.

'They can’t get jobs, some of these guys, and they are going out there and giving it everything they can'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the proposal is designed to motivate jobseekers to look for and find work quicker, with hopes it will change the unemployment culture to one where jobseekers are more proactive.

'Looking for work should be a full-time job if it's being done on the commonwealth taxpayer' he said.

Outspoken Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie (Left) is ready to go into battle with Prime Minister Tony Abbott (above) over the proposed changes to the welfare scheme.

Senator Lambie was briefed on the budget by Treasury officials on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Professor Raja Junankar, a A University of NSW industrial relations academic, also warned young people hit by the government's proposed work-for-the-dole changes will be forced into homelessness and crime.

Professor Junankar says research from the University of NSW's business school shows youth unemployment is largely caused by a lack of job training and apprenticeship schemes.

It could not be explained by high wages or over generous unemployment benefits, he said.

Lashing out at the work-for-the-dole proposal, the academic questioned how unemployed young people would survive without social security.

'If they do not come from affluent families they will become homeless and either depend on charitable organisations or resort to petty crime,' he said.

Senator Lambie's comments come just a few weeks after she made headlines for declaring she wants a 'well hung man' on a Tasmanian radio show.

'They must have heaps of cash and they've got to have a package between their legs, let's be honest,' said Mr Lambie. 'I don't need them to speak, they don't even need to speak.'
