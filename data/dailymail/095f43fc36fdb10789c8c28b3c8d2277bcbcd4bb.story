Cartoon Network has censored attempts by writers on its hit show Clarence to feature a full-on kiss on the lips between two gay characters.

In an episode of the animated series broadcast on Thursday, the two male characters kissed each other on the cheek as they greeted each other at a restaurant.

‘Originally the guy had flowers and they kissed on the mouth,’ tweeted the show’s writer Spencer Rothbell when a fan asked how hard it was to get a gay couple on the network.

No lips! Cartoon Network has censored attempts by writers on its hit show Clarence to feature a kiss between two gay characters - instead they kissed 

Rothbell, who also voices the main character, has since made his tweets private.

The Cartoon Network hasn’t commented on what prompted it to change the original scene in the episode entitled Neighborhood Grill.

‘It’s such a minor throwaway moment but I guess it’s better than nothing,’ Rothbell later posted on Tumblr. ‘Maybe one day the main character can be gay and it won’t be a big deal.'

The show remains fairly ground breaking for the network as it features its first ever gay characters.

The Disney Channel featured it's first-ever gay characters when a lesbian couple featured in the penultimate episode of Good Luck Charlie in January.
