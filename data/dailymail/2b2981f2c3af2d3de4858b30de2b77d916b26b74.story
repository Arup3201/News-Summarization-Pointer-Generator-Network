A 27-year-old man has been accused of fatally stabbing his elderly father and seriously wounding his mother in a savage scissor attack in their New York apartment this morning.

New York Post reported Anthony Powe was taken into custody in his underwear shortly after the 5.45am attack at the apartment at 784 Columbus Avenue, Manhattan.

The mentally ill son allegedly ran from the Upper West Side building near West 97th Street, through Central Park to East 96th Street on the other side of the city, where he was nabbed by police.

Darlington Powe, 71, was found dead inside the eighth-floor apartment while his wife, Alicia Powe, 56, was rushed to St. Luke’s 
Hospital in a serious condition.

The father, reportedly an accountant at Bellevue Hospital Center, had allegedly been repeatedly stabbed in the face and chest, and the mother had been stabbed in the chest.

Neighbors heard screams and called the police, who reportedly found a pair of bloody scissors in the apartment.

An upstairs neighbor told the Post she heard a woman yelling and begging the attacker to stop.

'Oh my god! I heard it! I heard a woman screaming in the apartment below. I heard her say, ‘Stop, you’re going to kill him! Oh my God, no!’ They are such beautiful people,' she said.

Powe's distraught sister said her brother loved his family and blamed his history of mental issues for the alleged attack, but said he had never been violent.

'I can't believe this is happening. He is schizophrenic. Once he realizes what he did, he's going to freak out,' Rochelle Powe, 44, told DNAinfo.

'He goes to hospitals on a regular basis
 and went to peer groups. He heard voices in his head. He had to stay on
 his medications.'

She said her father was a 'wonderful, fun-loving dad' who was good at math and created oil paintings.

Darlington Powe's ex-wife, Martha Powe, 70, said the alleged attacker 'always had problems'.

'He always had nervous problems. Darlington was worried about him,' she said.

'He was really worried. It was a major concern. He thought he needed treatment.'

Troubled: Rochelle Powe said her brother adored his family and was particularly close with his father, who he lived with in this Upper West Side apartment building

Pablo Maria, a 63-year-old maintenance worker in the building, told the Post the son had a history of troubling behavior.

'His son is crazy. Always walking around with capri pants, you know, short pants, making weird faces. He crazy!' Maria, who had worked in the building for 18 years, said.

'The
 problem [is] because too many people live in that apartment. Seven 
people in a studio! Two sons, two daughters, mother, father and 
grandmother in wheelchair. And crazy son!'

He said the son worked the night shift at a local food store.

A former neighbor who lived one door down for six years told DNAinfo she frequently heard fights in the apartment. She moved out of the complex about a week ago.

'They fought a lot. I shared a wall with them and they were always fighting, always screaming and fighting,' Fruma Reiss, 36, said.

A police spokesman told DNAinfo the suspect allegedly attacked his parents over a domestic dispute.

The Post reported police had responded to calls about domestic incidents eight times since December 2004, with the last call received on December 29 last year.

Charges against the son are pending.

The Columbus Avenue building where the attack occured is part of Park West Village, according to their tenants association website.
