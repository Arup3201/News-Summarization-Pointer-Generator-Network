A family have been awarded nearly £120,000 in compensation after a 'disastrous' trip to a Bulgarian hotel left them so ill that they are still suffering symptoms four years later.

The group of 16 became sick just days after arriving at the all-inclusive Royal Park in the Black Sea resort of Elenite in 2010.

Stephen Beever, 54, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said his six children suffered so badly that they still have stomach cramps today.

Mr Beever was on holiday with his wife Tina and their children, along with his brother and his wife Karie Westby and their children.

He said that as well as vomiting and suffering abdominal pain, the children also developed a high fever.

Mr Beever hit out at the 'appalling' and 'unhygienic' standards at the hotel, which led to the group experiencing severe abdominal pains.

Conditions described by the family following their  two-week break include food being left uncovered for long periods of time, flies  seen on the meals and cockroaches in the restaurant and rooms.

They also claimed the hotel's food appeared to be re-heated and re-used at meal times, and often appearing to be undercooked.

Some of the youngsters, including Liam Westby, 12, and his cousin Lucy Beever, seven, were celebrating their birthdays on the holiday, but were so ill that they spent the majority of their break in their room. 

Mr Beever, 54, said during the trip, his now seven-year-old daughter Lucy was crying continuously because of the pain in her abdomen.

During her illness, she could not eat and even liquids were difficult for her to keep down.  

Mr Beever added: 'Our holiday at the Royal Park Hotel was a disaster and has caused a lot of problems following our return.

'At least once a week Lucy will suffer with stomach cramps that cause her pain and distress.

'It has affected her life and her confidence irreparably, and she is reluctant to get involved with after school groups because of her ongoing troubles.

'It means that she is missing out on lots of opportunities, which breaks my heart.

'Lucy and [her cousin] Liam were both celebrating their birthdays whilst we were in Bulgaria, which we hoped would make it a really special time for them. 

'Sadly this is a birthday that we will never forget for all the wrong reasons.'

She was taken to the on-site doctor, but the family were only advised to buy her over-the-counter treatment from a local pharmacy.

Although this helped ease the symptoms, her illness, along with those of the other members of the family, lasted for the duration of the holiday.

The illness also left the five children on the holiday with on-going stomach cramps and vomiting which their parents now worry will remain life-long problems.

Lawyers Irwin Mitchell say they have also won settlements for 280 other holidaymakers who fell ill at the resort

Liam's mum, Karie Ashforth, 31, said: 'The children suffered horrifically during the holiday and it is awful to see them still struggling now.

'One of the worst aspects for Liam was having to miss football and time with his friends, things that a boy of his age should be enjoying without any worry.

'We felt that it was fair that we received a financial settlement of this order given that our family holiday was ruined by illness and due to the suffering we experienced then and thereafter. 

'We will never forget the ordeal but hopefully we can draw a line under it and move on.'

Specialist personal injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell in London have now secured a settlement of around £119,000 for the group.

Among them were six children, who were awarded a total of £90,000 at Sheffield County Court in September. The adults' within the family were given nearly £30,000.

The group were awarded the settlement from tour operator Balkan Holidays Limited after representatives admitted primary liability for the illness.

Jatinder Paul, a travel law expert at Irwin Mitchell, representing the group, said: 'This large family suffered from dreadful symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhoea and lethargy. 

'Aside from making their holiday extremely unpleasant, the illness has had a long-lasting impact, particularly for the young children involved.

'What should have been a two-week break for the family to spend together relaxing, ended up being ruined by the illness which left some of them confined to their rooms at times and has left some of them suffering with on-going symptoms.

'We hope that now the final settlement has been approved by the Court the family will be able to get on with their lives and put the experience behind them.'

Irwin Mitchell also represented another group of more than 280 holidaymakers who suffered similar illness at the same Royal Park hotel in 2008.

The group were awarded a payout totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds two years ago.
