The BBC was once known across the world for the precise elocution of its presenters.

But the corporation is now facing complaints that its staff are making basic errors in the use of English.

A number of viewers have pointed out that television personalities are increasingly pronouncing the letter ‘H’ as ‘haitch’ instead of ‘aitch’.

Viewers pointed to Sara Cox as one of a number of  BBC presenters who fail to pronounce 'H' in a correct way

Appearing on Points of View, a programme which airs public concerns over BBC content, one branded the falling standards ‘horrible, horrendous and harmful’ while another urged the corporation to ‘educate your presenters’.

Points of View highlighted several instances of the BBC broadcasting mispronunciations of ‘H’, including an advert for the Children in Need Great British Sewing Bee, in which guest presenter Sara Cox makes the error, and another television appearance by Radio 1 breakfast host Nick Grimshaw who makes the same mistake.

Speaking yesterday, campaigners said such mistakes marked the beginning of a ‘slippery slope’ and called on the BBC to only hire presenters who use the English language correctly.

Points of View presenter Jeremy Vine said the programme had collected a ‘whole folder’ of complaints about the issue and two viewers appeared on the show to express their concerns.

June Binyon said: ‘Would the BBC please instruct their presenters and commentators on the correct pronunciation of the letter “H”. For example, when announcing a programme is to be in HD, they will say haitchD. This is not correct. Please BBC, educate your presenters.’

Radio 1 breakfast host Nick Grimshaw has also come under fire by BBC viewers over his English elocution 

While Sharon Shepperd added: ‘I just cannot believe my ears that you, the guardian of the Queen’s English, is showing a television trailer where someone mispronounces the letter “H” as haitch. 

'Surely, this should never have been allowed to air, it’s horrible, it’s horrendous and it’s harmful to the English language. Is this the thin end of the wedge?’

According to campaigners, such a decline in standards in the BBC’s use of English could have negative impacts across the world.

Gareth Hardwick, who recently stepped down as secretary of the Queen’s English Society, said: ‘With the BBC in particular, it is listened to by a worldwide audience and people for whom English is a second language look to the BBC for an example of what is good English.

‘There are a whole number of reasons why the BBC might choose to recruit someone onto its staff as a broadcaster and maybe the use of English should be one and BBC broadcasters should be people to aspire to good, correct English usage’.

Dr Bernard Lamb, the group’s president, added: ‘It is a problem because presenters can be quite influential, so a mistake that broadcasters start taking up is easily spread to the rest of the population.

‘I take the view that you have to be very careful about slippery slopes and if you let one or two things through it will encourage people to let even more things through and become slacker and slacker.’

A spokesman for the BBC said: 'The BBC has won awards for its use of language and we are proud of the range of voices heard across our programmes.'
