Comic book fans have been rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, which has revealed that Thor is now a woman.

The hammer-wielding superhero will appear in her more shapely form in October, as Marvel experiments with bringing in a new audience.

Reaction to the proposed change was mixed, with fans taking to Marvel's Facebook page to rail against changes to their childhood heroes.

Daring: Marvel have revealed that Thor will be a woman in the next series of comics

Many questioned how the plot line will allow for this mysterious blonde woman to take over the hammer of Thor, speculating on whether she is a long-lost relative.

But Marvel has said simply that the new character using the power of Mjölnir - the hammer - is Thor.

'This new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!' Marvel editor Wil Moss said.

'The inscription on Thor's hammer reads "Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power 
of Thor." Well it's time to update that inscription.'

Fans are seeming more resistant to the change, which will mark the new series by Jason Aaron and illustrated by Russell Dauterman.

Some have dubbed the new-look Thor as Whor, and accused the comic book makers of taking feminism too far.

Others have stood by Marvel, and remained confident that the writers will explain how the god has become a godess.

McSullivan D'Ander posted on their Facebook page: 'Marvel Comics is not only going to attach boobs to 
Thor and start printing. There has to be an explanation.'

And Luis Carrero Rodriguez pleaded with fellow fans to 'be mature about this and embrace the fact that maybe Marvel is trying to include more strong female characters in their universe?'

The new-look superhero was also discussed on The View, with Whoopi Goldberg excitedly declaring: 'Thor, the God of Thunder, he messed up, and he's no longer worthy to hold that damn hammer of his.

'For the first time in history, that hammer is being held by a woman. That's right. Thor is a woman!'

In a statement Marvel said the new look Thor will be the eighth lead female protagonist, as the publisher tries to open up comics to more women.

For those mourning the loss of the God of Thunder, Aaron had words of comfort, saying 'This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.'
