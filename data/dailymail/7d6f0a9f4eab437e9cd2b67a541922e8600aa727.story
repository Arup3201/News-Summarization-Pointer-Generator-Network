The NHS is probing astonishing claims GPs are billing care homes for visits that should be free.

Fees paid by nursing homes are intended to cover so-called ‘enhanced’ services.

But there are concerns some family doctors are demanding the payments for nothing more than basic NHS care.

A Labour peer said if evidence of fraud was discovered it would be a police matter.

Concern: Some GPs are charging extra to visit care homes over and above their six-figure average earnings, it has emerged in a debate on care in the House of Lords. The government is investigating the claims (file photo)

It is believed some homes are passing the cost of GPs on to elderly residents, increasing the chance they will have to sell their property. Around one in ten nursing homes have paid a doctor for a visit, according to a survey by the Care Quality Commission.

It was reported last month that in one case a GP requested an extra £24,000 a year to cover services for 72 elderly residents.

Attack: Lord Hunt, Labour's health spokesman in the Lords, said the situation appeared to be fraud

Britain’s family doctors are already the highest paid in the Western world. Health minister Norman Lamb has asked NHS England and  the chief inspectors of GPs and social care to investigate how widespread the practice is.

Officials will then consider whether action needs to be taken against rogue doctors.

Many family doctors charge a fee for ‘enhanced services’ to care homes, but this is meant to cover extras such as training for nurses and  carers, or health and safety audits.

Ministers say the payment should not apply to NHS care, which should be provided for free whether or not a person is in a home.

Britain’s GPs enjoy an average package of £105,000 a year.

Despite their huge salaries, the vast majority took advantage of the stipulation in Labour’s 2003 botched contract that they could opt out of responsibility for their patients outside office hours.

The issue came to light during a House of Lords debate on healthcare provision to care homes.

Baroness Jolly, speaking for the Government, said: ‘Let me be clear: GP practices should ensure that any services provided to care homes for which a retainer is charged are not those  currently provided under their contract with NHS England.

‘NHS England is responsible for ensuring that the terms of the GP contract are being met.

‘Any GPs who provide services should do so free of charge, and any money paid by care homes to practices should be for something over and above that.

‘The sort of thing that we might be thinking of is assistance with training or possibly helping out with something like a health and safety audit, but certainly not basic NHS care.’

Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Brinton asked what the Government was doing to prevent ‘what appears to be double charging’.

Lady Jolly told her: ‘The department is working with both the Care Quality Commission and NHS England to get to the bottom of this. Guidance is in the process of being written and disseminated.’

Labour’s Baroness Pitkeathley urged the Government to take further action, insisting that to charge for an ‘enhanced service’ and not provide anything extra was fraudulent.

Lord Hunt, the party’s health spokesman in the Lords, added: ‘As this appears to be fraud, shouldn’t this be a matter for referral to  the police?’

Last night Ros Altmann, a former government adviser on older people, said: ‘The idea that just because someone is in a care home they should have to pay for NHS care is outrageous.

‘GPs have already got a very good pay deal and they have typically pulled out of out-of-hours. It seems utterly wrong to push this cost on to care homes, who will push the cost on to families who are already paying higher fees.’

Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘All practices provide comprehensive services free of charge to all patients in care homes.

‘A very small number of practices receive extra payments … to cover the costs of providing additional services, such as regular ward rounds or assistance with staff training.’
