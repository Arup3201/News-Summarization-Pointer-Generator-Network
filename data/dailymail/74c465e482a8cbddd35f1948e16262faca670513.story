Port Vale winger Byron Moore found his older brother hanged on the day he signed for his new club.

The 25-year-old revealed he will dedicate each goal he scores for Micky Adams’ side to the late Louis after discovering his body last Thursday.

Moore rushed to his sibling’s home in Staffordshire with their mother Jannice Mountford after receiving a text reading: ‘I want to be alone, it’s over’.

Louis, 28, had been a talented athlete who represented Great Britain as a teenager and was said to have been disconsolate after breaking up with his long-term partner six months ago.

‘I’m going to dedicate each goal I score to my brother,’ Moore said. ‘I will say a little prayer before the games.

'We were really close - we used to text all the time and I'd go round to his house to play Xbox. He watched me play at Wembley, and cried when I scored.'

Mountford added: ‘People can put a happy face but you never know what they are thinking. It was such a shock.  You don't expect to find your own son like that.

'We eventually got him down but it was too late.

On the move: Moore joined Port Vale on a free transfer from rivals Crewe Alexandra last week

'He said he had put £5 on the electric so I said I would go round and pay him back.  I got a message saying not to come as he wanted to be alone.

‘We have to believe he’s still here, he’s still watching. He has to be to keep an eye on Byron. We are just devastated beyond words.’

Moore signed for League One Vale on a free this summer after a seven-season stint at rivals Crewe Alexandra, where he made 262 league appearances and scored 30 goals.
