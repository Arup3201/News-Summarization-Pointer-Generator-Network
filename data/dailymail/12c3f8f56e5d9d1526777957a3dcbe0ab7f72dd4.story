It's the ‘U’ word Jose Mourinho doesn’t want to hear, but can’t avoid at present. Unbeaten. After 21 games this season, Chelsea’s record reads: won 16, drawn 5, lost 0.

In fact, the last time Chelsea lost was against Atletico Madrid in their Champions League semi-final second-leg on April 30 — 23 matches ago.

The last time they lost a Premier League game was against Sunderland on April 19 — a run of 17 matches.

As much as the Special One wants to escape it, he can’t ignore the ‘U’ word. And nor, it seems, can his players. ‘The unbeaten run is on our minds,’ admitted Oscar. ‘But the team just starts again every time and plays for a win, and if we win or if we draw it is OK. What is important is that we don’t lose.

‘Of course, we feel confident because we are not losing games. So you start confidently, but we need to continue like this.’

With Mourinho around, though, any bouts of over-confidence will be nipped in the bud. The Portuguese, despite his own self-confidence, isn’t one to tolerate arrogance in his players. Before Wednesday’s win over Tottenham, Mourinho was adamant an undefeated season in all competitions was ‘impossible’.

As quickly as the subject is broached, the Chelsea manager does his best to leave the issue behind. He views it as unnecessary pressure on his players when he wants them focused on winning matches — not producing an undefeated season. With Manchester City building up a head of steam behind them, Mourinho’s men do not need any other distractions.

‘The manager speaks before every game and he tells us not to be too confident,’ revealed Oscar. ‘Mourinho speaks before the games and makes sure our feet stay on the floor. We have so many games to play and we need to continue to win them. Of course he wants us to stay confident, but not too much because that can be dangerous.

‘He tells the attacking players to go for goals, to play our football, but when you don’t have the ball you have to defend. That is the way we have been winning games.’

That was backed up by Eden Hazard, who said: ‘Defensively we are very strong. All the players want to defend for the team, even the attacking players, even me. We are very strong and it’s important.’

You could, though, forgive Mourinho for briefly turning his mind to an undefeated campaign. He isn’t new to success but such an achievement would cement his place — if it isn’t already — as one of the greatest managers in history.

His squad is certainly strong enough to make a decent fist of it, too. Question marks over how the Blues would deal without the suspended Diego Costa against Spurs were emphatically answered by Didier Drogba who scored one and made another goal in the 3-0 win. It prompted Mourinho to reveal he is keen for the striker to continue playing for the club past his current deal that expires in the summer.

Sources close to the Blues legend insisted no decision would be made until after talks with Mourinho towards the end of the season.

But Oscar made his opinion on Drogba crystal clear, saying: ‘Ah, Didier — he is fantastic. Fantastic player, fantastic person and I am so happy he is a part of the team.

‘I learn from him. He speaks before the game to the attacking players. He wants to score every game. I watched him on TV when I was young, and we now play together.’

They’ll be lifting trophies together soon enough, too.
