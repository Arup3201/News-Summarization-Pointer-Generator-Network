Bumbling Pennsylvania cops tossed a New York couple in jail for the past month on drug charges but released the duo after the supposed drugs tested positive – as soap.

Annadel Cruz, 26, and Alexander Bernstein, 30, were pulled over last month for speeding in rural Pennsylvania. A search of their car turned up white powdery bricks wrapped in tape, which they insisted were soap but the officer insisted was cocaine.

The officer searched Ms Cruz’s Mercedes-Benz after smelling marijuana – which Ms Cruz admitted to smoking in New York, but not while driving – and found a small amount of pot in her bra, as well as the powdery soap, according to The Morning Call, which detailed the ordeal.

Locked up: The pair spent a month inside Lehigh County Prison

The officer insisted the powdery substance tested positive for cocaine in a field test and arrested them. 

The pair were hit with drug trafficking charges and tossed into Lehigh County Prison, where they remained on cocaine trafficking charges until last week, when an actual lab test came back indicating the powder was nothing more than soap – just as they had claimed.

They were held in jail on a bail of $500,000 for Mr Bernstein and $250,000 for Ms Cruz.

Ms Cruz was released from jail last Wednesday and all charges were dropped, but their lawyer doesn’t appear to be done fighting. Mr Bernstein was allowed to post his full bail the day before they were to be released.

Just soap: Powder bricks similar to these were suspected to be cocaine - but they're soap

‘I think it is a nice car with out-of-state plates and a Hispanic female behind the wheel,’ attorney Josh Karoly told the paper. ‘If it was me driving that car, this wouldn't have happened.’

The car was pulled over for speeding only five miles-per-hour over the speed limit – most cops won’t bother to pull over a car doing 60MPH in a 55MPH zone.

‘Anybody who drives under 60 miles an hour on I-78 has the chance of getting rear-ended,’ attorney Robert Goldman said. ‘It was one of the worst probable causes for stopping.’

Neither attorney has indicated whether they plan to file a civil lawsuit on behalf of either Mr Bernstein or Ms Cruz.
