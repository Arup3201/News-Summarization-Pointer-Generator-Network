Not only did Liverpool finish above Everton last season, they very nearly finished above everyone else.

Three points, ultimately, was the difference between second position and a first title in 24 years.

The traditional tussle with their city rivals had long since been settled, the Mersey running red for the first time in three seasons.

But will Brendan Rodgers again exert Anfield's authority over Roberto Martinez and the Blues?

The departure of Liverpool's Luis Suarez and subsequent return of Romelu Lukaku at Everton has blown open the debate heading into the new season.

Here, Sportsmail breaks down what we believe are the key factors in determining who will come out on top in the battle of Stanley Park...

All smiles: Romelu Lukaku has completed his £28million move to Everton after deciding to leave Chelsea

The New Boys

The Reds have splashed £90million already this summer and the cheque book, it would appear, remains open. Loic Remy was poised to join until he failed a medical at the weekend and another striker is top of the agenda.

But their recruitment thus far has been impressive. Forget any argument over value for money – fees are almost an irrelevance for the top clubs – the players they have brought in have undoubtedly strengthened Rodgers' squad.

Adam Lallana is proven Premier League quality and will add craft as well as graft to the starting XI.

Former Southampton comrade Rickie Lambert is a shrewd acquisition who, if used sparingly as expected, will be desperate to impact when called upon. Another Saint who marched out of St Mary's in the direction of Anfield is Dejan Lovren, and his influence at the back could yet prove the most telling.

Emre Can amplifies options in the middle of the park but it is the signing of Lazar Markovic which excites more than the others. Fans love something of the unknown and the 20-year-old Serb – blessed with a turn of foot and locker full of tricks - could well be the surprise package of the Premier League season.

But with that, of course, comes the risk of a settling-in period, given his tender years he would be forgiven as much.

At Everton, however, the re-signing of Gareth Barry and Lukaku – last season's loanees – comes with no such danger.

Lukaku scored 16 times last year, plundering 17 the season before at West Brom. Many have baulked at a fee which will rise to £28m, but don't forget this boy only turned 21 in May.

Completing Everton's new arrivals is Muhamed Besic, the 21-year-old Bosnia midfielder who signed for £4m from Ferencvaros. Tidy, tireless and tenacious – as he showed at the World Cup – the prospect of him, Barry and James McCarthy forming a midfield triumvirate is an exciting one.

The Old Boys

As much as we may celebrate Liverpool's new signings, they have, of course, arrived to the backdrop of Suarez's departure. And, putting aside bites and bans, to take away 31 goals leaves a huge void – just look at Spurs and the effect Gareth Bale's absence had on their subsequent campaign.

For no matter the fee received or the manner of its reinvestment, you simply cannot replace Suarez. You can try to compensate for his loss and that is what Rodgers will do, but there will be points lost this season from matches in which Suarez would have salvaged at least one and often three.

Everton, meanwhile, have lost none of their key players. Moreover, they have secured the long-term future of Ross Barkley and kept Leighton Baines at Goodison.

The Mainstays

New signings, naturally, will take centre stage when the action gets underway. But, invariably, it is those already in residence who make the difference.

Everton have a stellar blue-chip brigade; Tim Howard, Seamus Coleman, Phil Jagielka, Sylvain Distin, Baines, McCarthy and Kevin Mirallas.

Likewise, however, Liverpool; Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge the England quintet who were central to their title tilt last term.

In fact, it is hard to pick weakness when assessing their respective squads. A composite XI, you feel, would make for one helluva good side.

The Managers

There is no need to separate analysis of this pair; young, bright, innovative, fearless, shrewd and respected. There you have it, both clubs should have no worries over the men at the helm.

The Commitments

Both enter European competition at the group stage – Liverpool the Champions League, Everton the Europa League. That means the guarantee of six midweek fixtures and – were they to make it all the way to the final – a further seven matches for Liverpool and nine for Everton.

It is thought that Liverpool's unlikely title shot last season was aided by their absence from Europe. The addition of such strain this time around is the reason why many observers have already written off their Premier League aspirations.

Everton, of course, did not have to worry about continental distraction last year either and the Europa League – with its Thursday-Sunday pattern – has historically had a worse effect on a team's domestic season than the Champions League.

Food for thought? Brendan Rodgers will have to balance Liverpool's domestic and European ambitions

The Fixtures

The first two visitors to Goodison are Arsenal and Chelsea. Daunting or a chance to put down an early marker? They did, do not forget, beat Chelsea early last season and kicked off with a home victory over Manchester United 12 months previous.

The first Merseyside derby arrives as early as September 27 at Anfield, and Everton travel to Old Trafford on the back of it.

Liverpool, meanwhile, open at home to Southampton but are then handed away days at champions Manchester City and Spurs.

A title cannot be won in August, but a few bruising defeats can leave you licking your wounds and off the pace.

The Verdict

Twelve points was the difference between the rivals last season. Liverpool, minus Suarez and with the added exertion of Europe, will not, you suspect, better their tally.

Everton, with a settled squad and the permanent addition of Lukaku, should improve.

Still, however, you would back the Reds to shade it and finish on top in the battle of Stanley Park.

Either way, it promises to make for an intriguing season once more.
