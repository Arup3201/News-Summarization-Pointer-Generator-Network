Manchester City have signed teenage Watford forward Jadon Sancho in a £500,000 deal.

The Championship club agreed terms on Friday and the 14-year-old will link up with City's academy.

Sancho, an England Under 15 international, already has a sponsorship deal with Nike and is tipped to make a top flight career.
