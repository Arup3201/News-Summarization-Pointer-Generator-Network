A daring pilot flies his plane over a volcano as red-hot lava bursts into the sky.

The scorching lava, which reaches temperatures of 850C, erupts in the air up to heights of almost 200 feet.

On board the little blue and white plane are sightseers, who get an up close view of the spectacular volcano, as they were just 300 metres (984ft) away.

A daring pilot flew his plane over a volcano as red-hot lava bursts into the sky at a volcano in Holuhraun, Iceland

The scorching lava, which is 850 degrees Celsius hot, erupts in the air up to heights of almost 200 feet, and has been erupting since 1783

These stunning pictures were taken by photographer Baldur Sveinsson, who was in another plane flying around the volcano.

The 72-year-old retired teacher captured the photographs at a volcano in Holuhraun, Iceland.

Baldur, from Iceland, travelled with his friend, pilot Elias Erlingsson, to witness the longest and largest eruption in Iceland since 1783.

While in the air, he was able to make contact with another plane flying around the volcano and ask them if he could take pictures of them.

Baldur said: 'This eruption started on August 31, 2014, and has been sending lava to the surface since and shows no signs of stopping.

'Myself and a private pilot friend, Elias Erlingsson, decided to go to Holuhraun for sightseeing and see if we could find anyone out there to photograph with the crater as a background.

'The flight from Reykjavík to the eruption took around an hour in our aircraft, an airobatic Cap 10, registered TF-UFO.

'When we arrived, there was a sightseeing flight from the Myvatn area in the vicinity, and we called them up.

'My pilot told them that he had me with him, and asked if we could follow him during his last passes for some photography, to which he agreed.

'All of the aircrafts pass the crater on the upwind side to avoid the toxic fumes and the disturbed air.

'Every aircraft that approaches the area will announce its arrival, distance and altitude on a common frequency, so there have been no dangerous close encounters.

'Infrared cameras have measured the temperatures of distant objects. The fire fountains were over 850 degrees Celsius.

'It was a stupendous example of the forces of nature and makes one very insignificant in comparison.

'This is about as far from any settlements or towns as an event like this can be.'
