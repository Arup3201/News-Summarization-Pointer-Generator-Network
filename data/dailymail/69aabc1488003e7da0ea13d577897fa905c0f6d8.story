Arrest warrants have been issued for two of the nation's most notorious jihadists, Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar, by the Australian Federal Police.

This comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed a disturbing photo of Elomar holding up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria.

The picture was uploaded on Friday by his friend, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, on Twitter.

Since then, the AFP have issued warrants for their arrest for terrorist activities if they return to Australia, according the ABC.

Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men

In the sickening image, Elomar is seen smiling - with a pair of sunglasses tucked into his shirt - as he holds up two decapitated heads by the victims' hair.

Another image, uploaded on Friday, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings.

Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear.

The photos were uploaded by terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'.

Disturbing: Sharrouf also posted a photo of two men placing severed heads on a metal railing

His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]'

Elomar and Sharrouf, who spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne, are believed to be fighting with terrorism group Islamic State - an al-Qaeda off-shoot.

They are thought to have flown to Syria together late last year after Sharrouf fled the country on his brother Mustafa's passport.

Meanwhile, Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 charged with 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'.

Khaled Sharrouf posted the photos on Twitter alongside captions such as 'this guy lost his head!!! Lol'

The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats'

He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation

Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has threatened the Australian Federal Police and his countrymen on his Twitter account

On Thursday night Attorney General George Brandis's spokesman told The Australian that 'if real, these photos are evidence of serious crimes against Australian law and possible war crimes.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted AFP for further comment.

Sharrouf, also a former Sydney resident, taunted Australian police via his social media account two weeks ago, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians.

The jihadist is currently in the Middle East fighting with the extremist group after he evaded authorities in December.

The tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations.

Speaking to media earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'.

'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said.

Mr Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots.

'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said.

When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'.

Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police.

'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said.

He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'.

These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account.

Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts.

On July 14, Sharrouf tweeted he loved to slaughter Australians to the AFP

He said it would have been easy for him to attack Australia if he wanted

Sharrouf's account is littered with photos of him posing with weapons and military trucks as well as a young child brandishing a rifle
