Shoppers have been warned to check for surcharges before using tap and go card machines after supermarket chain ALDI was caught charging customers without disclosing it.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) took action against the discount supermarket company after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems in any of its stores.

ASIC also found that ALDI failed to disclose the 0.5 percent surcharge it charges consumers for paying by credit card in some of its stores.

Under the ASIC Act retailers that fail to adequately disclose surcharges, or create the impression that surcharges do not apply, may be considered 'misleading or deceptive'.

Tom Godfrey, spokesman for consumer group Choice, said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go.

'Most people don't realise that tap and go relates to credit so obviously if you're using a credit facility surcharges can come with that,' Mr Godfrey said.

'What we take issue with is whether the surcharge is at a reasonable level, and what we have seen is excessive surcharges going on.

'The surcharge at ALDI is not excessive, but I don't think it's great they're charging a surcharge on a debit facility, so people's savings accounts.'

Mr Godrey said shoppers needed to ask about surcharges before using tap and go.Â

'I think it's always important to ask - as you've seen with ALDI, you might assume there isn't a surcharge because Coles and Woolies don't have one,' Mr Godfrey said.

'If you're going to use tap and go you should charge ask what the surcharge will be, then ask for a surcharge free option.'

ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges.

'Merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs,' Mr Kell said.

'Consumers should also be mindful that payments by contactless or "tap and go" cards are currently treated as credit card transactions, meaning that fees may apply where there are surcharges in place, even where they are using a debit card.'

ALDI will put signs and stickers at the front of shops and at registers to inform customers of the charges following the action by ASIC

Cashiers will also be made to tell customers about the charges before the transaction is finalised.

In ALDI stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge, irrespective of whether customers use a debit or credit card.

An ALDI spokeswoman said it has always charged credit card surcharges to 'cover the costs associated with the service'.

'ALDI is aware there are high costs associated with accepting credit cards,' she said.

'However, rather than inflating prices across the board, to compensate for the credit card acceptance costs, ALDI prefers customers to make the choice themselves.'
