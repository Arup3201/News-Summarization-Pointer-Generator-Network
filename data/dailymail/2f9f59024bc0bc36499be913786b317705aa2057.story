The BBC has spent almost £30million on hotels for staff in the past three years including one room costing £633-a-night.

Despite the corporation promising to cut costs, the bill is up by 32 per cent in the past year, with up front spending for the upcoming World Cup in Brazil and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow blamed.

New figures have revealed that in 2011 the total paid out for hotel rooms stood at £8.4million, rising to £8.8million in 2012. 

But in 2013 it rose to £11.6million, taking the three year total to £28.8million.

Big spender: BBC has paid almost £30million for hotel rooms in the past three years, including here at the Art Hotel in Amsterdam

A breakdown of the most expensive rooms reveals that one room booked cost £633 for a night, but on several occasions in excess of £300 a room was spent.

But the BBC has refused to name many of the hotels, who stayed in them and for how long.

A
 BBC source, who asked not to be named, said today: 'It's fair to say 
that BBC staff go all over the world, sometimes at short notice, to 
cover events, but to pay more than £600-a-night for a hotel room is 
taking the mick.

'Most normal people would make do with a basic hotel, like a Premier Inn or Travelodge for a maximum of £100-a-night or so.

'The
 simple fact is that it's not your average BBC worker living it up in 
these hotels, it's the big bosses or presenters - and that's what makes 
everyone a little bit peeved off when we are meant to be cutting back on
 expenses.'

High price: One BBC staff member stayed in the NH Doelen Hotel in the Dutch capital but the Corporation says it is trying to keep costs down

Favourite: At least one BBC worker stayed at this Hotel Dante in Barcelona on three occasion, costing an average of £400 a night or more

Hotels stayed at include the trendy 84-bedroom Art Hotel in Amsterdam, the NH Doelen Hotel, again in Amsterdam, and the Premier Dante Best Western Hotel in Barcelona.

The 'room rate' price paid for the Premier Dante Best Western Hotel in Barcelona by the BBC in 2013 is listed as £400.38, despite the fact that you can book a room at the hotel for £116 today.

The 'room rate' paid for a stay at the Art Hotel in Amsterdam by the BBC in 2011 was £254.29, but again, if you were booking a room today it could cost you as little as £121-a-night.

In 2012 the BBC paid a 'room rate' of £443.91 of the NH Doelen Hotel in Amsterdam, when you could book a room now for £113 for the night.

And in all 30 'top prices' paid for hotels, just one was in the UK - booked in 2013 for £378-a-night.

Top 10 hotel 'room rate' prices for 2011, 2012 and 2013 paid for the BBC, revealed in a Freedom of Information request;

A spokesman for the BBC said: 'The BBC doesn't choose the location of major events around the world – like the World Cup or the Olympics which incur costs – but we do book in advance to save money'.
