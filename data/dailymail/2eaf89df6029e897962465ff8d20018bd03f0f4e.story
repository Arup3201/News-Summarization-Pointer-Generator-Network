A 22-stone teenager who shed nine stone in twelve months in a bid to find a girlfriend is now fighting off attention from the ladies - after becoming a Justin Bieber lookalike.

William Cookson, 17, from Liverpool, was a virtual recluse and had never been kissed when he tipped the scales at 21st 9lb and struggled to squeeze into his XXXXXL school uniform.

Taunted by his classmates and desperate to find love he embarked on a drastic diet and exercise regime.

After slimming down to 13 stone he discovered a previously hidden uncanny resemblance to teen pop star and heartthrob Justin Bieber - and is now deluged with attention from adoring girls.

From blubber at age 14 (left) to Beiber at 17: William's dramatic weight loss has not only greatly boosted his self esteem, but also increased his luck with the ladies. He admits he now enjoys 'lots of female attention'

Mr Cookson confesses ‘I must admit I never saw the resemblance when I was bigger but when I lost the weight, I started getting compared to him on my Facebook profile.’

‘People would comment on my pictures suggesting I look like him, I just used to laugh it off, but being compared to somebody who is adored by millions of girls isn’t a bad thing.

‘I used to get no female attention whatsoever. I knew a girl would never have looked at me when I was 21 stone and instantly have fallen for my personality, so I knew I had to do something.

‘I don’t think I would have even 
kissed a girl if I stayed the way I was, so I’m really glad I decided to
lose weight. I’ve had three serious girlfriends and a few flings 
since.’

Mr Cookson, who grew
up in Liverpool, saw his weight balloon during his teenage years by 
gorging on fish and chips, Doritos and chocolate.

Uncanny: Mr Cookson (right) may not have Justin 
Beiber's (left) wealth or chart success, but his weight loss and 
resemblance to the star means he is now amassing his own legions of 
adoring females fans

He was bursting out of his school 
uniform which, with a 48-inch waist, had to be specially ordered, and 
watched enviously as his peers began to date girls.

Mr Cookson admits is weight was beginning to affect his social life self-esteem.

‘I always felt like an outcast because at an early age I was always bigger than my peers,' he said. ‘My weight seemed to spiral out of control and I was too young to even notice.

William, here aged 9, gained weight by over indulging on junk food such as Doritos and chocolate

‘When I was fat I didn’t really used 
to go out, I was too scared of being insulted and what other people 
would think so instead I sat at home, watched television and used to eat
instead of socialising.

‘Harsh comments at school about how large I was really affected me, it was then I decided to do something about it.

‘All of the people around me were in relationships and I was always the one who was left out.

‘I
was sick of hearing girls moaning about how badly lads treat them, so I
thought if I lost the weight I could show them that not every guy is 
the same.’

Mr Cookson, who 
is completing his A-Levels at Liverpool Community College, enlisted the 
help of his uncle - a personal trainer - to help him lose the weight.

He embarked on a strict gym regime, cut out all snacks and eats three balanced meals a day.

Mr Cookson is now regularly stopped by strangers who mistake him for teen pop sensation and heartthrob Justin Bieber.

’I
must admit I never saw the resemblance when I was bigger but since 
shedding the pounds I’ve been told lots of times that I’m the spitting 
image of Justin.

‘I think it’s the hair, although he has cut his differently now, he always used to have long hair and wear a hat like I do.

Breakfast: Usually skipped

Lunch: Sausage and chips or fish and chips from a chip shop

Dinner: Burger, sausage rolls or other frozen fast food, always served with chips

Snacks: Three packets of crisps- usually Doritos, two or three chocolate bars, MacDonalds, and several fizzy drinks

Exercise regime:

None. William found it difficult to walk even short distances and could only manage two minutes on the cross trainer when he started loosing weight.

Breakfast: Cereal such as Special K

Lunch: Chicken and salad sandwich on brown bread with low fat butter

Dinner: Low-calorie Weight Watchers ready meals or homemade meals like Spaghetti bolognaise made from scratch with fresh ingredients

Snacks: Up to five pieces of fruit a day

Exercise regime:

Gym sessions 4 to 5 times a week for an hour and a half at a time. This usually involves one hour of cardio such as running and then 30 minutes of weights.

‘I
take it as a huge compliment. He has millions of female fans all over 
the world and is dating one of the most gorgeous girls in the world, so 
obviously he must be doing something right.

‘Most
lads would find it hard to admit but he’s an attractive guy, he’s 
dating a beautiful girl and he literally has enough money to do whatever
he wants.

‘Now I look like Justin Bieber my confidence has gone through the roof and I get lots female attention too.’

Mastering the pout: Mr Cookson says he is now regularly stopped in the street by passersby mistaking him for Beiber

Happier days: William, here aged 8 with his school friends, admits that as he entered his teenage years, his weight became more of an issue for him socially
