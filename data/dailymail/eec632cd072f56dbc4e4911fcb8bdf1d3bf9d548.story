The family of an Australian surfer who has gone missing in Bali have reportedly offered a $5000 reward for information.

Peter Maynard, 45, from Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast has been missing since August 27  after he failed to return back to his hotel room.

Posters have sprung up around the Indonesian islands of Bali and Nusa Lembongan, where he was last seen, which read: 'Peter Maynard. $5000.00 Aus for body alive or not.'

The father of three was on a solo surfing trip on Nusa Lembongan, an island just off Bali, and failed to check out of his hotel room five days after he was last seen.

His family believe he was surfing when he disappeared, as his white Hammo brand surfboard was among items missing from his hotel room.

On Monday, a surfboard fragment matching the description of the board used by Mr Maynard was handed into Indonesian police.

Detective Nyoman Wirajaya said the fragment was found at a local break called Shipwrecks on August 28.

The local man who found it handed it into police on Saturday after learning a surfer was missing in the area.

Mr Maynard's wife Kylie confirmed that the surfboard was her husband's.

While search continues for the missing man, a Queensland man died while surfing at a popular tourist break off the Indonesian coast at Lombok on Friday morning.

Geoff Moase, 48, was pulled from the water at Sorga Beach in Lombok, east of Bali after he was spotted floating in the surf by a local fisherman.

Friends of Mr Moase's helped bring him to shore and performed CPR on the 48-year-old who was taken to an Indonesian clinic where he died a short time later.

Mr Maynard's wife told News Corp Australia of her disbelief at her husband's disappearance.

She has travelled to Indonesia to help with the search and believes one of her husband's three surfboards was missing from his room.

'I am doing as well as can be expected,' she said while waiting for a flight to Indonesia.

She said her husband had travelled alone on his surfing trip and last made contact with her two weeks ago.

But she said she didn't have any clue he was missing until she was contacted by consular officials.

The father-of-three was last seen ten days ago at his hotel, in Nusa Indah Bungalow on Nusa Lembongan, having breakfast on August 26 at around 9am.

It was when Mr Maynard failed to check out on August 28 that staff became suspicious and reported him missing to police.

Hotel owner Made Mariata told Daily Mail Australia Mr Maynard checked in to the hotel on August 23 at midday and was meant to stay for five days.

'Checkout was midday on the 28th and we didn't see him but the key was still at reception. We waited for a long time and then had a look at his room - it has all his bags still there, his passport, his wallet, wet suit and camera.'

Mr Mariata said they then reported him missing to police.

Police are mystified on the whereabouts of the Australian tourist, failing to find any trace of Mr Maynard despite searching the area and speaking with locals.

They said all options have been assessed and nothing adds up. 

'Police have helped us look everywhere - checking the harbour, speaking with the boat company, checking to see if he went snorkelling. 

'We searched until late at night and then continued next morning but we didn't find him.

'We are still looking' 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia they are providing consular assistance to the family and friends of the Australian tourist.

'We hope we find him safe, our fingers are crossed,' Mr Mariata said. 

Mrs Maynard is due to talk to officials on Friday.
