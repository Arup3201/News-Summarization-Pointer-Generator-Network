Brothers Brad and Dallas Woodhouse share the same DNA but when it comes to politics, the two couldn't be more different, and on Tuesday, when their partisan differences were on full display during a televised debate, their mother Joy unexpectedly called in to ask them to stop fighting.

'I'm your mother and I disagree that all families are like ours. I don't know many families that are fighting at Thanksgiving,' she said, scolding her political operative sons.

'I was very glad that this Thanksgiving was the year that you two were supposed to go to your in-laws, and I'm hoping you'll have some of this out of your systems when you come here for Christmas.'

'Oh, God. It's mom,' conservative activist Dallas Woodhouse, left, said this morning when he realized the C-SPAN caller on the line was he and brother Brad's mother. Brad, a Democratic political operative, is pictured on the right

Dallas Woodhouse, a Republican, is the founder of the North Carolina based grassroots group Carolina Rising. Before that he worked as the director of the Tar Heel State's Americans for Prosperity chapter.

His brother, Brad, is accomplished in his own right, having founded progressive group Americans United for Change and worked as the communications director at the Democratic National Committee. He now serves as president of political action group American Bridge.

The siblings' unusual relationship was the subject of a documentary released earlier this fall aptly called Woodhouse Divided.

'I’m the Democrat, he’s the wing nut – he was dropped on his head as a child,' Brad told attendees of the Washington, D.C. premiere of the film in September.

The documentary covered a four-year span of the brothers' lives and included scenes of them defying their mother and arguing at holiday gatherings.

Longing for a drama-free Christmas get-together this year, she called into C-SPAN's Washington Journal program this morning to reproach her sons, who were on the cable channel to discuss whether 'bipartisanship is good for governing.'

The show's host had just finished teasing them about the heated back and forth they were having when he informed them that a caller named 'Joy' from Raleigh, North Carolina, was on the line for them. 

'Hey, somebody from down south!' Dallas said excitedly.

'You're right I'm from down south!' the voice on the line barked at him.

'Oh, God. It's mom,' he said a moment later, burying his head in his hands. 

Joy Woodhouse called into C-SPAN this morning while her boys - who couldn't have more different political views - were on the television channel having a heated discussion about bipartisanship

'They're both very passionate about what they believe in, and I love that about them,' she said. 'But I hope that they just kind of get this out of their system today on your program.' Brad told her, laughing, 'That is wishful thinking'

At one point during his mother's rant about their bickering, Dallas tried to jump in, but his brother cut him off and said, 'Let your momma talk.'

When she had finished, she told them, 'I would really like a peaceful Christmas. And I love you both.'

Taking advantage of the opportunity to chat with dueling political operatives' mother, the program's host asked Joy what it was like to raise the two brothers.

'Well it hadn't been easy,' she candidly responded.

This time it was Brad's turn to say, 'Oh god.' 

'We love you mom,' Dallas told her.

'They're both very passionate about what they believe in, and I love that about them,' she said. 'But I hope that they just kind of get this out of their system today on your program.'

'Ain't no way that happens,' Dallas said.

'That is wishful thinking,' Brad told her, laughing.
