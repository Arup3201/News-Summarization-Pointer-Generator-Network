Christmas nightmare: Nigel Heathman, pictured, assaulted his friend with a frying pan

A former soldier who savagely beat his friend with his own kitchen appliances in a violent two-hour assault has been jailed today.

Nigel Heathman invited himself into the home of Martin Gumbrell on Christmas Day and attacked him with plates and bowls before smashing him over the head with a frying pan.

Mr Gumbrell passed out several times during the assault, only for Heathman to revive him with cold water so he could continue the attack, Exeter Crown Court heard.

The 39-year-old finally struck Mr Gumbrell with the frying pan so hard it bent, before leaving him on the floor of his flat covered in blood.

The victim was in the middle of preparing Christmas dinner when an upset and intoxicated Heathman knocked on his door on December 25 last year.

Heathman, who had recently split up with his wife of 24 years, was spending his first Christmas away from his four children and had been drinking heavily at lunchtime, the court was told.

Mary McCarthy, defending, said Heathman had lost his business in the recession, after which he started drinking heavily.

This wrecked his marriage and led to his estrangement from his wife and their four children.

He vented his fury on Mr Gumbrell who invited him in to share his Christmas bottle of brandy.

Heathman then subjected Mr Gumbrell, who has a long history of anxiety and depression, to the violent assault using bowls, plates and the frying pan.

During a four-day trial Mr Gumbrell told the jury how he eventually came round, and fled in bare feet to raise the alarm.

He said he had been left with gashes over his head and a deep cut on his scalp where he had been hit by the pan.

Heathman claimed the victim had gone berserk and started attacking him for no reason. He said he had gone too far in self-defence but did not intend to cause such serious injury.

Jailed: Nigel Heathman was found guilty by a jury at Exeter Crown Court and sentenced to six years in jail

Heathman, of Torquay, denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent but was found guilty by a jury at Exeter Crown Court.

He was jailed for six years by Judge Erik Salomonsen, who told him: ‘It was Christmas Day and you knocked on the victim's door so you could enjoy his hospitality. He offered you a drink.

‘You took it upon yourself, for whatever reason, to subject him to a serious, violent and persistent attack. You were the author of all the violence.

‘You attacked him with your fists, you pulled his long hair, some of which you pulled out. You hit him with a heavy ceramic bowl, plates and caused multiple cuts.

‘You struck him with a frying pan with such force, using it like a cleaver, as to bend it. There was blood everywhere in the flat, a flat into which you had been invited and had no right to be.

‘The evidence shows you used water from a bowl to revive him when he became unconscious. This was a persistent and violent attack.

‘The victim still suffers from the effects. He feels unsettled in his own home and was a man who was already suffering from depression and anxiety, which has been increased by the assault.’
