The owners of a swingers club in rural Arlington, Texas, have agreed to move on after a wave of furious backlash from their neighbors.

David and Shannon Esopenko have been throwing weekly erotic parties in their 4,860-square-foot leased home dubbed 'Eutopia' since May 2014.

But in January, after neighbors complained, city officials ordered an end to the festivities on the grounds that Eutopia is an illegal home-business.

Despite initially fighting the claim, the couple have decided to close their lease and take the party elsewhere.

'We're moving on,' Mr Esopenko told The Dallas Morning News. 'The city of Arlington isn't going to get our $14,000 in taxes every year.'

Parties: Since May, David Esopenko (right) and his wife Shannon have been throwing these parties at the 4,680-square-foot house called 'Eutopia' located in an upscale North Arlington neighborhood

The couple currently lease the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, with lawn space for 70 vehicles, according to the Star Telegram.

Though the club did not charge guests, party-goers were encouraged to make donations: $80 for couples, $20 for single women, and $80 for single men.

The city held that these donations rake in thousands of dollars a night for Eutopia, but Mr and Mrs Esopenko claim all profits are used for snacks and drinks.

While some of the neighborhood's residents questioned the morality of the establishment that offers food, drinks, and condoms, city officials said it is a zoning issue.  

Erotic: The Esopenkos lease the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, and has reportedly had nearly 60 of the erotic parties - some with themes

Features: The three-story Eutopia features playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen

Furnished: The home, leased to Esopenko by its owner James Self, is furnished, but no one lives there

Zoning: While some of the neighborhood's residents question the morality of the establishment that offers food, drinks, and condoms, city officials say it's a zoning issue

Favorite: Many praised the operations at the venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play'

Friends: Esopenko held that he was simply throwing parties for his close friends

Events are permissible in homes if it only takes up 20 per cent of the property, according to Arlington law. But officials said they believed Eutopia's clientele were partying all over the house.

The city also held that Eutopia is a business operating out of a single-family home because of its regular hours of operation (each weekend from 8.30pm to 3am), its promotional advertising, and its services which include a valet for the guests and sometimes laundry service. 

On Thursday, Mr Esopenko said he spoke with the owner, James Self, and they decided it would be 'mutually agreeable' to move the parties elsewhere.

He said: 'We’re still gonna throw parties wherever we move. That’s how we like to spend our free time.

'I know one neighbor who had a burr up his butt is probably doing a dance because we’re leaving, but it doesn’t bother us one bit.  

'This had nothing to do with zoning. We could say we’re no longer taking donations. It would not have mattered in the least to the neighbors and the city. 

'The city tried to make it out like it was zoning. But we were under no delusions. This was all about morality. They knew it, we knew it. They had to say that for political and legal reason. Everybody knows what it was about.'

Officials began investigating Eutopia after receiving complaints from neighbors about noise and weekend traffic. 

Police allegedly sent undercover officers to investigate the alleged 'sex club' after receiving multiple complaints last summer but the officers reported no illegal activity going on in the residence. 

According to the Telegram, the three-story Eutopia features several playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen area. It is completely furnished but there are no permanent residents. 

Speaking to WFAA, Esopenko defended the club as a healthy alternative to normal clubs:

'The average person that comes is a nurse, teacher, fireman, policeman, judge, former Arlington city councilman. 

'These are people who don't like to go to normal clubs to hang out because they are too dark, too loud.'

And the 'lifestyle venue' has received positive reviews on swinger sites like Swinger Date Club.

Many praised the operations at the three-story venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play.'

Other reviewers have described Eutopia as a 'clean, beautiful home full of sexy, smart people,' the Telegram reports.

One reviewer wrote: 'The only drawback I've found is the mattresses are a little hard, but that won't stop me from having fun there.'
