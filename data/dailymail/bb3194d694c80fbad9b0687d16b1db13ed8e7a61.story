Curious toddlers can end up in the strangest of places when they learn to walk and start exploring.

But the mother of this youngster was shocked to turn around while cleaning and find her daughter stuck fast in a bucket.

Little Minnie Snodgrass had to be removed by firemen after clambering into the pail while her mother, Gemma, was mopping the kitchen floor of the family home in Conisborough, South Yorkshire.

Minnie Snodgrass got herself wedged in a bucket while her mother, Gemma, was cleaning the kitchen. She eventually had to be removed by firemen after being taken to hospital

Mrs Snodgrass said she popped upstairs for a moment before finding her 16-month-old giggling in the bucket.

'She must have climbed in, sat down and got wedged. I had just mopped the kitchen floor and emptied the bucket,' she explained.

'I went upstairs and I heard Minnie's four-year-old brother Matthew shout "Mum, Minnie's stuck". I picked up the bucket and panicked when I couldn't get her out.'

Mrs Snodgrass's mum, Rose Cope, 54, came to the rescue and drove them to Montagu Hospital in Mexborough, South Yorkshire.

Mrs Snodgrass said: 'Minnie looked quite content as she sat waving her arms and dancing in the bucket.

'She barely let out a whimper the whole time, she actually seemed to enjoy being stuck and was dancing around in the back of the car.'

Mrs Snodgrass said Minnie stayed remarkably calm during the incident and even seemed to enjoy the fuss

When they arrived, hospital staff rang the fire service to help. Four firemen then used bolt cutters to remove the youngster, being careful not to hurt the little girl.

Thankfully, Minnie escaped the experience unhurt and her family say she even seemed to enjoy the experience.

Hairdresser Mrs Snodgrass said: 'It was so embarrassing walking in, I said to my mum that she would have to carry her in, which she did.

'When we got to the counter my mum plonked the bucket on the desk and said "she's stuck".

'At first the receptionist said they couldn't help us and that we should call the fire brigade, but eventually one of the nurses called out and said it wasn't fair to have people laughing at us, so brought us to a back room and called the fire brigade.'

She added: 'They were really nice about it. When they first arrived they said "We've never seen anything like this before".

'But they were trying to keep Minnie calm, telling her to keep still and that everything would be all right.

'My mum was talking to Minnie as well as she started to get a bit upset because she didn't know who the fire crew were.

'I'll definitely have to keep a closer eye on her in the future as getting stuck definitely hasn't stopped her wanting to explore and climb things. She was back to her usual self straight away afterwards.'

A South Yorkshire Fire spokesman said: 'We're delighted Minnie is safe and well and hope she is recovering from her ordeal.

'This is one of thousands of special service incidents we attend each year. If we weren't here to rescue toddlers from mop buckets, who would?'
