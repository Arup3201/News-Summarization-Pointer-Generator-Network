The entire South Devon hamlet of Bantham is going on the market on Friday, complete with beach, boathouses, golf course and pub.

All 728 acres have been owned by the same family for generations, and will have an asking price of £10million.

The sleepy settlement - which has one pub and and a village shop - was bought up by a military commander in 1922, and most residents rent their properties.

And now - thanks to a dispute over a food van - its 21 homes and other properties will go on the market to the highest bidder.

When Gillian Goddard - one of the estate's five directors - allowed a 'gastrobus' to sell food and drink to visitors, she was deluged by complaints from locals attacking her act of 'commercialisation'.

This, according to The Times, caused her to change her mind about bequeathing the estate to the visitors, and she amended her will to demand the village be put on the market.

She died in November, triggering the sale, which is being run by estate agents Strutt and Parker. If no single buyer emerges, they intend to split the village into six separate lots.

The prospect of a new landlord has alarmed residents - many of whom rent their homes.

Rod Seymour, the landlord of the Sloop Inn pub in the hamlet, said: 'The same families have lived here for generations. We came here five years ago and since then only one property has been sold.'

Another said: 'People are nervous, of course they are. We’re worried that someone from London will see an ‘opportunity’. They’ll kick the tenants out and turn the cottages into a "boutique hotel".'
