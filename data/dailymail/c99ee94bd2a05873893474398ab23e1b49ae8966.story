McKenzie Reign Speigner tragically died in Sept 2012 after consuming a dishwashing detergent tablet

The parents of an 18-month-old girl who died after eating dishwashing detergent are facing jail because they were too intoxicated to do anything to help her.

Investigators have charged Kristopher Joseph Speigner, 31, and Joy Lynn Speigner, 29, of Madison, Alabama, with criminal negligent homicide in the death of their daughter, McKenzie Riegn Speigner. 

Affidavits say the girl swallowed a dishwashing detergent pod and her parents didn't seek medical help for her until the next day because they were so out of it on prescription drugs and alcohol.

Madison Police Capt. John Stringer 
said the crime of criminally negligent homicide is a misdemeanor 
punishable by no more than one year in jail, report AL.com.

The
girl's father was arrested on Monday and her stepmother surrendered to 
authorities on Tuesday after a year-long investigation into the death 
which happened on Sept 30, 2012.

The arrest warrants were filed a year later due to waiting on forensic data.

In
a Sept. 9 affidavit, Madison Police Sgt. Drew Westrope testified that 
the girl's father and her stepmother ‘did not seek medical help’ for the
child ‘due to (their) state of intoxication, which was the result of 
ingesting pharmaceutical medication and drinking alcohol.’

Jail records show the two parents have been released on $6,000 bond each. It's unclear if they have attorneys.

The girl’s biological mom Jessica Marie Gainey had died in a car crash in December 2011.
