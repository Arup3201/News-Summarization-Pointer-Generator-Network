A fire department that sponsors a controversial cull of squirrels in a village in New York State has come under fire from animal rights protestors.

The Holley Fire Department, in the Village of Holley, in eastern Orleans County, has been hosting 'Squirrel Slam', an event promoting the hunting of the animals for prizes, for the past six years.

This year's event, set to take place on February 16, includes a 14 years and under prize category, a move that has drawn the ire of animal advocates.

More than 7,500 people have signed petitions started by animal charity Hand4paws and Texan animal rights activist Julie Gallagher calling for a halt to the event.

The annual 'Squirrel Slam' in Holley, NY, has attracted criticism after offering youngsters prizes to kill the woodland animals. File picture

The Hand4paws petition, which will be presented to Mayor John W. Kenney, Jr states: 'With so much controversy surrounding guns, and guns in the hands of children, the public is outraged that this event targets a childrenâ€™s category that allows a child to take home money for killing squirrels.

'It is a sadistic form of entertainment that is sponsored by the Holley Fire Department. Although it is stated that this event follows all the hunting rules of the state of the New York, it does not mean that just because it is legal, that it is morally right.

'The Holley Fire Department is said to follow federal, state and local standards, and yet it is unreal that they promote such act of violence in the hands of young people or that the whole state of New York finds this event as something that represents their culture and beliefs.

The annual cull is in its seventh year and is sponsored by the Holley Fire Department, a volunteer service. File picture

Under New York state regulations, 12-15 year-olds can hunt small game, which includes game birds, small mammals - such as squirrel and rabbit - and reptiles and amphibians.

Young hunters must have completed a hunter education course and have a junior hunting license.

Hunters aged between 12 and 13 must be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or a person who is 21 years or older and fully-licensed and accredited, while 14-15-year-olds youth must be accompanied by an 18-year-old.

Hunting with rifles for big game like deer and bear is still prohibited for those under 14 in New York.

It continues: 'Just this past December 24, the nation saw the fatal shooting of two firemen in western New York, yet the Holley Fire Department has no respect for those that lost their lives, and continues patronizing this senseless massacre for what they call a "tradition".'

There is also a Facebook page, 'Stop the 7th Annual "Hazzard County" Holley New York Squirrel Hunt' which now has nearly 1,000 followers.

The Holley Fire Department is a volunteer organisation and was not available for comment at time of writing.

However, the website states that the event follows all the hunting rules of the state of the New York.

The website www.holleyfire.com has 
recently posted on their website an event that calls for people to 
register in the adult and the youth category of the event, although it was today inaccessible.
