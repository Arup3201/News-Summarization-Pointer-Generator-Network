A video interview has been released that shows Bill Cosby finally responding to recent allegations that he drugged and raped several women.

With his wife Camille by his side, the actor seems uncomfortable, and very irritated, when the question is asked of him.

The previously unreleased interview was filmed back on November 6.

Awkward moment: Bill Cosby was forced to respond to claims that he drugged and raped several women in an interview with his wife Camille by his side (above)

Speaking out: Cosby (above) responded to the allegations made against him saying he has 'no response' and 'no comment'

'There’s no response,' Cosby tells the AP interviewer.

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. 

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis -  Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. 

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.  

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

'There is no comment about that. And I’ll tell you why. I don’t want to compromise your integrity, but I don’t talk about it.'

His publicist then get extremely irritated that the question was even asked, and Cosby himself demands that it not be put in with the video. 

'I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,' says the actor. 

The AP has revealed they did not release the video at the time, which was meant to be about the Cosbys loaning 50 artworks to the Smithsonian, as they were just asking him based on claims that Hannibal Buress had made, the standup comedian whose acknowledgement of Cosby's past troubles with women claiming he sexually assaulted them brought up the subject again. 

This is the most Cosby has said on the subject since three women came forward recently saying that the actor drugged and raped them.

Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, and supermodel Janice Dickinson have all told similar stories of being given pills and then sexually assaulted by Cosby.

Bowman and Tarshis were both teenagers when the incidents with Cosby occurred.

Meanwhile, Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, called Dickinson's allegations 'false and outlandish,' adding that the former model was 'seeking publicity to bolster her fading career.' 

Cosby, who has never been convicted on any of these charges, did settle a civil suit with a woman in 2006 who accused him of drugging and raping her two years earlier in his Philadelphia mansion. 

Uncomfortable pause: Cosby later said he did not want his response to the question to air

Support: Actor Stacey Dash tweeted her support for Cosby on Wednesday 

These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star.

Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations. 

TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the netowrk.

At least one person came forward to show some support for Cosby however, with actor Stacey Dash tweeting on Wednesday that he was a mentor to her and never tried to assault when they worked together.
