Michael Kitchen will reprise his role as Christopher Foyle who will tackle Cold War crime

The long-awaited return of beloved television detective Christopher Foyle was almost over before it had begun when its creator feared the series had 'outstayed its welcome'.

Michael Kitchen's character will return to the screens this month in the eighth series of Foyle's War.

The show's creator  Anthony Horowitz met Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks, who plays driver Sam Stewart, to decide whether to resurrect the popular series.

He told The Observer: 'Michael Kitchen, Honeysuckle and I met 18 months ago to discuss whether it was worth bringing it back. Had we outstayed our welcome?'

But after showing pages of plot ideas both actors decided to they wanted to reprise their roles and Weeks said she was also persuaded by the development of her character.

The new series set in the Cold War will see DCI Foyle join MI5 spies instead of tackling World War II crime.

Mr Horowitz said they had to change setting for the drama because 'we had run out of war'.Â 

The series looked to have been no more when it was cancelled in 2007 by ITV director of television Simon Shaps.

But it was resurrected after a campaign by viewers who were furious it had been axed.

It was created in 2001 by Horowitz and 
commissioned by ITV1 to fill the void following the end of long-running 
detective series Inspector Morse.

An episode in VJ Day in the previous series broadcast in 2010 attracted 7.6million viewers.

By then the new director of television Peter Fincham oversaw a U-turn and a new series was commissioned.

An atomic bomb explosion opens the new
series in a New Mexico desert before a Russian is seen stealing secrets
from an embassy in London.

Foyle is then asked to try and help in the search for a traitor and then joins MI5 where he will work 
as a senior intelligence officer.

The plots will range from identifying highly placed atomic spies to a true story of government corruption.

Anthony Horowitz met with the cast 18 months ago to decide whether the show had 'outstayed its welcome'

He will also discover that the British establishment is rife with communist sympathisers and traitors.

Mr Horowitz told The Observer: 'He is entering a brave new world. All the rules have changed. It's an ambivalent period, a dark and difficult time.'

Former ITV drama controller Nick Elliott said: 'I don't think the change of enemy will matter too much. We don't like Stalin any more than Hitler.'
