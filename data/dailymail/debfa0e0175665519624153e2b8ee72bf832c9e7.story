The established order in women’s tennis was restored when Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams swatted away younger challengers to make the final of the Australian Open.

At a time when the female game has been gloriously unpredictable in the grand slams, the world’s No 1 and 2 players will meet in Saturday’s final, the nineteenth time they have played each other.

Williams saw off the breakthrough player of the event, her compatriot Madison Keys, 7-6, 6-2 but only after the teenager had saved eight match points and pushed her hard in the tiebreak, which she won 7-5.

On another windy day, and in another semi-final featuring players from the same country, Sharapova had a more comfortable victory, beating No 10 seed Ekaterina Makarova 6-3, 6-2.

The fact that there were eight different women’s finalists in the four grand slams last year is a mark of how open the women’s game has become.

This time it has gone to form, and if it goes to form again in the final then Williams will be the winner, as she has had a hold over the Russian, beating her sixteen times out of eighteen. In fact you need to go back 10 years for Sharapova’s last win.

While Makarova seemed a bit overwhelmed by the occasion, 19 year-old Keys’ performance suggested that she will be around for a long time to come, striking her heavy groundstrokes despite having a sore upper left leg.

Williams has not had the easiest passage through at what has not been of late a particularly happy event for her. She has not gone beyond the quarter-finals since winning in 2010, her fifth Australian title.

After her undulating form in the major events last season she has looked very businesslike here, and was too solid on this occasion against someone bound to trouble her in future.
