TV presenter Jenny Hanley has revealed she was hit by a series  of mini-strokes as she organised a memorial service for her mother,  the actress Dinah Sheridan.

The former star of children’s TV show Magpie, who also appeared as a Bond girl in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, said she is lucky to be alive after she ignored bouts of going blind and paralysis in one arm.

She now realises it was ‘heavily against the odds’ that she made it to her mother’s memorial service in April.

Warning: Jenny says others she not make the same mistake and ignore such symptoms

‘I was stupid, and extremely lucky to have got away with it. It was monumental good fortune that I’m not damaged,’ she said.

Miss Hanley, 65, a former model, said 
the first signs her life was in danger came on March 24 as she lay in 
bed reading.

She said: ‘I’d been under a lot of stress, losing my 
mother, sorting out her things and organising her memorial service.

‘I was reading when my right eye suddenly couldn’t see and my left arm went numb. But I got up and my body soon recovered.’

Later, she walked to a friend’s for lunch when the symptoms struck again as she ate.

‘I went blind in my right eye and my left arm went dead for ten minutes,’ she said. ‘But neither of us thought it was serious.’

Two days later, on March 26, as she 
travelled by train to St Paul’s Church in London’s Covent Garden to 
discuss the memorial service, a dark shadow descended over her right 
eye.

She then lost the sight in that eye when the vision ‘went all 
white’.

Her GP referred her 
to Hillingdon Hospital in West London, where doctors discovered one of 
her arteries was 80 per cent blocked and in danger of triggering a 
full-blown stroke.

She was admitted to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, 
where she had another mini-stroke – her fourth in 12 days – as surgeons 
performed a carotid endarterectomy to clear the artery of debris.

Even
then Miss Hanley insisted she should be allowed to leave the hospital 
on April 8 to attend her mother’s service the following day.

‘I did make
the service, although I wasn’t with it due to painkillers and wore a 
scarf to cover the wound on my neck,’ she said.

She
is now warning others not to ignore the warning signs. ‘More must be 
done to explain to idiots like me that a mini-stroke can be very 
damaging,’ she said. ‘I should have dialled 999 immediately. It 
horrifies me that I didn’t do that.’
