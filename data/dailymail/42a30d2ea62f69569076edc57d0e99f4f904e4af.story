An outbreak of the deadly bubonic plague has tormented the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan after the death of a 15-year-old boy.

Three more people showed symptoms of the 'Black Death', and in total 131 came into contact with the victim.

More than 800 people have been screened in the town of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.

The disease wiped out tens of millions in
 14th century Europe.

It was reported that 15-year-old Temirbek Isakunov  died 
after eating a barbecued groundhog infected with the lethal virus, yet another account suggests he became infected after being bitten by an oriental flea carried by a marmot that he reportedly prepared for food.

Eastern districts of the mountainous country were in 'lockdown' last night as officials sought to prevent the plague spreading.

Neighbouring Kazakhstan has warned residents not to travel to the country for fear of contracting the disease

Neighbouring Kazakhstan urged its people not to travel to the country, and introduced 'special monitoring' of those crossing the border.

Three villagers who were in contact with the dead teenager - a woman with a toddler and a teenager - show  symptoms of bubonic plague, admitted a government source.

Symptoms include fever and swollen lymph nodes in their armpit and neck areas.

'They had contact with the deceased 15-year-old,' said the government source.

The outbreak is in the easternmost district of Ak-Suu in the Central Asian country, bordering China, where more than 800 people have been screened. 

Emergency officials have gone door to door in the boy's village searching for signs of infection which is more common among animals than humans.

The country's health ministry last night played down the threat, saying there was no evidence the disease had spread beyond the boy who died.

The Ak-Suu district, which borders Kazakhstan and China, lies close to the Issyk-Kul lake and is a popular tourist destination.

Chaos apparently jeoprodised treatment of the boy, leading to a failure to initially diagnose the cause of his illness.

'While fighting for the life of the teenager, doctors gave the boy 17 different drugs which made it difficult to make an accurate diagnosis,' admitted Kyrgyzstan's Health Ministry.

As many as 19 doctors are among those being monitored for signs of the disease.  All have been put in quarantine and are undergoing preventative treatment.

Groundhogs are a natural carrier of the deadly disease and were targeted for extermination in the Soviet Union, but the Kyrgyz authorities stopped poisoning them from 1982 onward due to the costs involved.

'The teenager turned for medical aid in the district hospital with the health complaints for running temperature and bubonic inflammations on August 22,' said the healthy ministry in capital Bishkek.

'He was immediately taken to hospital in the surgery ward.

The bubonic plague was only detected after he died.

Health minister Dinara Saginbayeva said: 'There will not be a bubonic plague epidemic.

'The form of the disease in the teenager is not conducive to a plague epidemic. So there are no grounds for closing the borders.'
