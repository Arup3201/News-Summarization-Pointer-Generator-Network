A former alleged girlfriend of Prince Andrew has blasted claims an underage ‘sex slave’ was forced to sleep with him - saying the Duke is one of the 'most decent' people she knows.

Former Playboy model Denise Martell claims she has been a close friend of Andrew since they were first linked in 2000, and is confident Virginia Roberts’ allegations she was forced to have sex with him in the US while aged 17 and working as a masseuse for convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein are fabricated.

The scandal – first revealed in US court documents last week, in which Miss Roberts, now 30, claimed she had been forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002 – have been vehemently denied by Buckingham Palace.

Denise Martell claims to have been a close friend of Prince Andrew for 15 years - and says he is one of the most decent people she knows

The Prince was allegedly introduced to 17-year-old Virginia Roberts by Ghislaine Maxwell, the then-girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein

Speaking outside her home in Malibu, California, Denise exclusively told MailOnline: 'Andrew's been a good friend of mine for 15 years and he's such a kind person and one of the most decent people I know. 

'There is not an ounce of truth to these false allegations.'   

Glamorous Denise, 50, is the first of the women Prince Andrew has been linked to since his 1996 divorce from Sarah Ferguson to come speak out on his behalf.

Fergie has already launched an impassioned defence of her ex-husband, telling reporters Andrew is 'the greatest man there is'.

The Prince, 54, has also been linked to another former Playboy model, American actress Angie Everhart, bikini model Monika Jakisic and model and actress Caprice Bourret - not to mention rocker Courtney Love.

So far, they have all kept quiet over the allegations.

An American journalist has revealed she tried to expose Jeffrey Epstein's predatory behaviour 11 years ago - but Vanity Fair refused to print it.

Vicky Ward, a contributing editor at the magazine for 11 years, was asked to profile the billionaire back in 2003.

In a blog for The Daily Beast, Ms Ward - who describes Epstein as a 'Gatsby-esque character' - describes how she was made uncomfortable almost immediately.

'Epstein had invited me to an off-the-record tea at his Upper East Side house (during which I distinctly remember he rudely ate all the finger food himself) and then had his assistant call to tell me he’d thought I was pretty,' she recalls.

But it wasn't the unwanted compliment which worried her: it was - among other things - a conversation she had with a mother of a 16-year-old Epstein had allegedly molested.

'He’d gotten to them because of his money,' Ms Ward wrote, adding: 'The girls’ mother told me by phone that she had thought her daughters would be safe under Epstein’s roof, not least because he phoned her to reassure her, and she also knew he had Ghislaine Maxwell with him at all times.'

But when she tried to include the account in her final piece, it was pulled.

A Vanity Fair spokesman told the Daily Beast the decision was taken because “Epstein denied the charges at the time and since the claims were unsubstantiated and no criminal investigation had been initiated, we decided not to include them in what was a financial story”.

But Ms Ward - who said Epstein had 'a way of spooking you' - says it wasn't a financial piece - adding: 'it has often struck me that if my piece had named the women, the FBI might have come after Epstein sooner and perhaps some of his victims, now, in the latest spate of allegations, allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up, would have been saved.'

However, it was Denise who forewarned of a lack of security around Andrew, when she met him during one of his business trips as an official representative of Britain in 2000.

These trips would later prove controversial after it was alleged he was using taxpayers’ money to fund a lavish lifestyle while on official business. 

Denise met Andrew in Los Angeles, where they are said to have had a three-day romance, during which he invited her to his room alone on two consecutive nights.

Speaking in 2001, Denise said: 'The nights I was alone with him in his room he never had any security with him. 

'I had only just met him. But I walked straight to his room. I knocked on the door and he opened it.

'He'd given me his room number, his code name, his private mobile phone number, everything.

'He gave the mobile number to me on the first night after I'd only known him a few hours. There was never any security there. I was very surprised. I was shocked. The President would never have been left alone like that. I was worried for him.'

During their time together, the Prince was said to have stripped to his boxer shorts and allowed Denise - who now works for Diane Warren’s music publishing company, Real Songs – to tuck him into bed.

Denise's support for Andrew follows hot on the heels of one of Epstein's troupe of girls saying she was 'dumbfounded’ by claims the Prince abused a girl at an under-age orgy.

Dara Preece Gehringer told how she was one of a group of young women flown by the billionaire on his private jet to St Tropez in Southern France for an evening of entertainment in 2001.

‘I flew on Jeffrey’s private jet and we had dinner with Andrew,' Miss Gehringer revealed. 

'He seemed relaxed. He was wonderful and a gentleman.’

She described Miss Roberts’ claims as ‘extremely unlikely’, telling the Mail: ‘I’m dumbfounded. I can’t believe he took part in anything like that. That’s my opinion. He was nothing but pleasant to me.’

‘If everything that went down the way she said, I just have a hard time believing it because they (Epstein and his friends) are not people like that.’

In 2011, Andrew, fifth in line to the British throne, stepped down from his role as UK Special Representative for Trade and Investment over his friendship with Epstein, who by that time was a convicted sex offender.

Epstein, 61, a billionaire financier, completed 13 months in jail on a charge of soliciting sex with an underage girl after striking a plea deal in 2008.

Despite Epstein’s conviction he was photographed walking with Andrew in Central Park, New York, after his release.

Epstein also stands accused of trying to cover up his actions by tracking down witnesses and warning them against testifying against him. 

However, Miss Roberts and four alleged other victims – who have not been identified – continue to make allegations against Epstein.

Epstein has denied the claims, saying they are made up. 

Miss Roberts claims she was recruited to be a personal ‘masseuse’ to the disgraced tycoon when she was just 15 and that she was abused by ‘royalty’, ‘politicians’ and ‘academicians’ while under his employment.

She subsequently moved to Australia, married and had three children, but later returned to the US where she co-operate with the FBI investigating Epstein’s dealings.

She said in 2011: ‘I am anxious. I am still frightened of him because he has so much power. I had to put this behind me.

'But in the end this is not for me. It’s because I’m afraid there are a lot of girls still doing what I did for him, eight years after I left. I want to be the one who breaks the chain.’

There is no suggestion Andrew was aware of any pressure being exerted on Miss Roberts, who has gone into hiding in Colorado since her explosive claims about Andrew and Epstein were filed at a courthouse in Palm Beach, Florida, last week.
