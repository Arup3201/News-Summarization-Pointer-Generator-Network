A toddler died in a tragic accident when he fell from his grandmother’s moving car after undoing his own car seat and opening the door, an inquest heard today.

Levi Brailsford’s grandmother heard the click of the door handle on her black Volvo 4x4 as she drove across a roundabout in Bristol but as she tried to pull over, the door opened and he tumbled out of the vehicle.

He suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where his death was confirmed.

Tragedy: 'Determined' Levi Brailsford suffered serious head injuries and died after undoing his seat-belt and falling from his grandmother's moving car in front of horrified witnesses in Bristol 

Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court, near Bristol, heard the 'determined' two-year-old had previously slipped his arms out of the harness on his child seat and that he knew how to use the handles to get out of the car.

The hearing was told the child locks were only active on the side of his car seat because there would normally be someone sat beside him.

A police officer said that if the child locks had been active on both sides of the car the accident was 'unlikely' to have happened.

Kathleen Medway had stopped her car after spotting her daughter, 29-year-old Andrea Brailsford, with Levi on their way to pick up her eldest child from school on May 11.

Mrs Brailsford was struggling with the toddler and her mother offered to take him home for her.

Levi jumped into the car and was sitting in his car seat, behind the front passenger seat, as his grandmother headed off.

Three to four minutes later, as she turned left from Hollway Road on to Stockwood Lane, Levi had unbuckled his belt, crawled across the seats and opened the back door on the driver’s side.

In statements read to the hearing, witnesses said they were horrified when they realised an 'object' they saw fall on to the road was a small boy.

Visibly distressed, Mrs Medway told the hearing she was certain she had strapped her grandson into the child seat properly before she started the car.

The coroner was told there were no faults with the car seat or the car that could have contributed to the accident.

Avon Coroner Maria Voisin recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Mrs Medway, from Stockwood, told the inquest: 'As I was driving down to the roundabout I heard the door go.

'I didn't shout or anything as I thought that if I did it would make him jump, so I just kept going round very slowly.

As I pulled up on to the pavement, in my mirror I saw the door had flown open.

'I
still didn't think anything much of it, just that it had opened. I got 
out and pushed it closed, that's when I saw him on the floor, then I 
screamed.'

The hearing was read witness 
statements from William Roach and Sean Whittle who were driving in a 
silver Mercedes just behind the black Volvo.

Mr Whittle said: 'I saw an object fall out of the car. As it landed I was horrified to see that the object was a young child.

'We
both swore and instantly stopped. We immediately jumped out of the car.
The driver of the car, a woman I now know to be his grandmother, got 
out of the driver seat.

'She looked at the child and said 'oh my god'.
The grandmother immediately went to the child and scooped him up in her
arms, she was hysterical, pulling him to her chest and screaming 'what 
have I done? Oh my god, I've killed Levi'.'

Mr Whittle and Mr Roach called the emergency services and said many people gathered and tried to help the bleeding child.

Great Western Ambulance Service sent paramedics and an air ambulance to the scene and attempts were made to revive Levi before he was taken to Frenchay Hospital.

Police Constable Mark Steadman was called to the scene to carry out a forensic investigation at around 3pm on the day of the incident.

He told the inquest he had tested the child seat and the car doors but found no faults with either.

He said the harness on the seat was not designed to be a restraint and that in an emergency situation should be able to be operated by a child.

'His family thought Levi was more than capable of doing this,' Pc Steadman said.

'He was either pulled out or fell out and landed on the carriageway.'

Asked by the coroner if both child locks had been active whether the accident could have occurred, he said: 'It's unlikely to have happened, which is why they fit rear safety locks in the vehicles.'
