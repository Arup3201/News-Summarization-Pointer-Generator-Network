David Keene, the outgoing president of the NRA, said Barack Obama was an anti-gun activist even in the years before he sought public office

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, outgoing National Rifle Association president David Keene said Barack Obama 'knows better' than to claim American guns are to blame for violence in Mexico.

'I would rank the president's statement about 
American guns being responsible for the mayhem in Mexico right up there 
with the ads running before the election that said that he wasn't 
opposed to Second Amendment rights. The fact of the matter is, he knows 
better.'

Keene spoke to MailOnline on the convention floor at the NRA's annual meeting and convention in Houston, Texas.

Obama claimed Friday during a speech at 
Mexico’s National Anthropology 
Museum that 'most of the guns used to commit violence here in
 Mexico come from the United States.'

The comment was roundly criticized by gun-rights defenders and repeated in media outlets that have been traditionally unfriendly to the NRA.

Keen told MailOnline that President Obama's recent public push for new gun control laws is a natural extension of his political positions through the years.

'This guy was an anti-Second 
Amendment activist long before he ever ran for office,' Keene said.

'He had said in 
the past that he didn't believe any private citizen has a right to own a
 firearm,' he continued. 'He has supported legislation that would have banned the 
ownership and manufacture of sidearms in America.'

CONTROVERSIAL: Incoming NRA president James Porter has reportedly called Barack Obama 'a fake president,' and referred to the Civil War as the 'War of Northern Aggression'

The National Rifle Association's David Keene knocked President Obama's campaign ads that claimed he would protect gun owners' Second Amendment rights in a second White House term

'So it was our belief 
that he couldn't afford to do anything, politically, before the 
election. And of course his campaign actually ran ads saying "Barack 
Obama will support your right to keep and bear arms".'

Asked if that claim in the president's re-election campaign ads were lies, Keene was diplomatic.

'Well,' he said, 'they certainly weren't truthful.'

The White House did not respond to requests for comment about Keene's accusation.

Keene's term as NRA president ends Monday. The position is awarded on a rotating basis to a different NRA officer every year. His successor, James Porter, is an Alabama attorney who spent the past 12 months as the organization's First Vice President.

Porter warned NRA members during a speech on Friday that they are in the midst of an American 'culture war.' He he a history of fiery rhetoric, including calling Obama 'a fake president and saying Attorney General Eric Holder is 'rabidly un-American.'

The Associated Press reported Saturday that Porter is also on record calling the U.S. Civil War the 'War of Northern Aggression.'

Soft sell: 'Guns save lives' stickers at the NRA convention in Houston seem quaint compared to the bare-knuckle rhetoric that has become common in the national gun rights debate

Keene said groups funded by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (R), shown with Barbra Streisand at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner in Washington, were helping a Connecticut activist disrupt town meetings in New Hampshire

On Friday, according to the AP, Porter called for every U.S. citizen to be trained in the proper use of military firearms. This, he said, would allow Americans to defend themselves against future tyrannical governments.

By comparison, Keene seems mild-mannered and almost docile. But he has no warm feelings for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose self-funded Mayors Against Illegal Guns organization has become a thorn in the NRA's side.

Inside the convention, gun lovers and gun vendors - like this man from the firearms retailer ALLSTAR Tactical - vied for the attention of the tens of thousands who descended on Houston for the year's biggest gun rights event

'Michael Bloomberg's groups are spending a lot of money, even now,' Keene told MailOnline, 'advertising in those states where Democratic senators voted with the NRA' on a failed White House-approved legislative proposal that would have required universal background checks for gun buyers.

Activists funded by Bloomberg, Keene said, 'are harassing those senators. Two town hall meetings were broken up in New Hampshire by one activist from Sandy Hook [Elementary School] who Mayor Bloomberg has, and they're taking her around.'

'She was supposed to be here ... but that hasn't happened yet. They're trying to make it as uncomfortable as possible for people to support the Second Amendment.'

The only protest that materialized at the Houston event included about 45 people at its peak, and was anchored by activists from Code Pink, Occupy the NRA, and Moms Demand Action.

The NRA convention attracted a reported 70,000 attendees and vendors.

Keene said he's not worried about White House Press Secretary Jay Carney's hint on Friday that President Obama is still considering a raft of executive orders to implement gun control measures without the approval of the House and Senate.

'It's very difficult for him to do as much as he might like via executive order,' Keene explained, 'because, in fact, in order to fund the actions he might order, he has to go to Congress.'

In Mexico, Barack Obama said American guns were responsible for most of the deaths in Mexico related to gun violence

'We're going to have a whole series of fights that are going to take place in Congress and elsewhere.,' Keene added. 'There's no question, though, that Obama can make life miserable for gun owners.'

But first, Keene said, he has to wrap up his tenure as the NRA's top dog.

And then, he told MailOnline, 'I'm going to get a knee replacement, and then I'm going to go fishing.'
