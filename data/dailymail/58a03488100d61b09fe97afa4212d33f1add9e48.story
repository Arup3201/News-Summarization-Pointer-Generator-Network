Two Massachusetts high school athletes have been kicked off their lacrosse team right before championships after being photpgraphed smoking a cigar at graduation.

Beverly High School students Nick Donovan and Dylan Jutras were both suspended from the sport for the rest of the season after the photo of the celebratory smoke appeared in the local paper The Beverly Citizen as part of their graduation coverage.

Despite both being 18, making it legal for them to smoke tabacco, the students were told their decision goes against the strict policies of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA).

'On the morning of Thursday, June 5 the Beverly High School administration was notified of a possible violation of MIAA policy by two student-athletes,' Beverly High School Principal Sean Gallagher said in a statement on Friday.

'After contacting the MIAA headquarters and consulting with officials there, it was confirmed that the nature of the incident did indeed constitute a violation of MIAA policy.

'As part of our school and district policy we do not comment on matters related to personnel or student issues.'

The MIAA have a strict zero-tolerance policy when it comes to alcohol, drugs and tabacco, a spokesman told .

The suspension means the boys will miss the Divsion 2 North finals on Saturday.

John Donovan, Nick's father, said his son is 'devastated' over what happened.

'It's a minor infraction with a maximum penalty and I don't think it's right,' Mr Donovan told The Salem News.

'I don't think it's applied with the spirit of the rule in mind.

'The spirit of the rule is, we don't want any student to be involved with drugs and alcohol, which I agree with 100 percent.

'However, the application of the ruling was not in line with the spirit of the rule itself.'

Mr Donovan described the cigar-smoking as 'a celebratory thing that transcends generations and cultures'.

'What's the first thing people do when they have a baby? They hand out cigars,' he said.

'Look at the statue of Red Auerbach (smoking a victory cigar).

'It symbolizes victory, it symbolizes accomplishment.

'It doesn't symbolize anything negative as far as I'm concerned.'
