A court case was delayed after a solicitor got stuck in the toilet of a magistrates' court -  and it took nearly two hours to free him. 

Jonathan Whettingsteel, 29, had just arrived at West Hampshire Magistrates' Court in Southampton, Hampshire, at 9am when he made a quick dash to the second floor toilet.

But as he went to leave, he realised the door was jammed and he could not get out. He used his mobile phone to call reception, who alerted the court's maintenance team. 

A court case was delayed after solicitor Jonathan Whettingsteel got stuck in the toilet of a magistrates' court - and it took nearly two hours to free him

It took more than 90 minutes for staff to free Mr Whettingsteel, who works for law firm Shentons in Winchester, Hampshire.

Mr Whettingsteel, who has a black belt in Japanese martial art Mushin Jujitsu, was only at the court to cover for a colleague, who could not attend.

But he still saw the funny side, and said: 'At least it gave me time to read my files.' 

Mr Whettingsteel said: 'I'd just arrived at the court and I needed to go to the toilet, so I quickly made my way to the loo.

'But when I went to leave, I pulled the door handle and it snapped.

'It came away from the bolt, so it was just moving freely and I couldn't pull the bolt back to open the door.

'The door was floor to ceiling and so there was absolutely no way out.

'Luckily I'm not claustrophobic and my problem-solving mind kicked in.

'I called down to the court reception and told them: 'This is really embarrassing, but I'm stuck in your toilet'.

'They sent up some security advisors, who thankfully saw the funny side too.

'It took about 90 minutes to open the door as they had to drill through the door and manipulate the bolt out of the fastening.

'It was a big relief to get out of there.'

The short criminal hearing, which was due to be heard at 9.30am, went ahead after he was freed.

He added: 'The reception staff had explained to the court and the client what had happened to me.

'So thankfully the court was able to continue with other cases in the meantime and everyone was understanding, as well as, I expect, rather amused.

'I apologised profusely and the case went ahead when I returned.

'Thankfully I wasn't sent down to the cells as a punishment - I think I'd been locked up long enough for one day.'
