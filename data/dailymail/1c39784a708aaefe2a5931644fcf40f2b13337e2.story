A 24-year-old woman who is suing a hospital after they threw away her brother's healthy kidney during a botched organ transplant has talked of the emotional trauma her family suffered.

'Somebody wasted part of my brother,' Sarah Fudacz told Good Morning America today, adding that she realized something had gone wrong with the transplant as soon as she was wheeled out of theater.

The 24-year-old, who was suffering from end-stage renal failure had been due to receive a kidney from her brother Paul at University of Toledo Medical Center.

Trauma: Paul and Sarah Fudacz are suing after a hospital botched their kidney transplant

'Wasted': The hospital threw out the kidney Paul was donating to save his sister's life

She said when her brother first offered to donate one of his kidneys it was 'the most amazing moment of my life'.

'This was going to be the end of it, I was finally going to start feeling better,' she said.

Surgeons at the University of Toledo 
Medical Center removed the organ from Paul on August 10, 2012
to give it to his Sarah, but a nurse, 
Judith Moore, threw it away as she discarded the contents of a slush 
machine before the operation was over.

Doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the organ for two hours after the accident was discovered.

Sarah realized there had been a problem as she was taken out of surgery. When she lifted her surgical gown, she could see there was no incision.

'I just cried because I couldn't believe that I was back where I started,' she said. 'I should have been recovering. They threw away my life, they threw away something that meant so much to me.'

Her brother told Good Morning American: 'What really brought it home to me was seeing my sister walking around fine and I'm in bed in pain.'

'Beautiful moment': Sarah was moved by her brother's offer to give her a kidney

Paul, who was 17 when he underwent the surgery for his sister, is now left with only one-functioning kidney after the hospital threw away his healthy organ.

Medical expert Dr Richard Besser said: 'When you donate an organ for a relative it's beautiful though you are putting yourself at slight risk.'

He described the mistake as a 'never event ... as it should never happen' and added that people had lost their jobs because of it.

A spokesman for the hospital said: We apologize sincerely. We have done our best to find many remedies to help those affected move forward.'

After consulting with the family, physicians decided not to risk using the kidney because they thought it was likely another compatible donor could be found.

The hospital, which found another donor for Sarah and covered her traveling costs so she could undergo the surgery in Colorado, is now trying to dismiss their lawsuit and recover its own costs.

Sarah, John, 
their parents, and their four siblings filed a lawsuit on July 29 against 
UTMC in the Court of Claims in Columbus.They individually demand $25,000, plus interest and the costs of 
the suit.

Their attorney Jim Arnold said UTMC had been accommodating after the mix up but that the Ohio attorney general’s office, which 
represents UTMC, would not accept some of the family's demands.

On Tuesday, the medical center responded to the Fudacz family lawsuit, acknowledging the organ was discarded but denying some of the Fudacz 
claims, the Toledo Blade reported.

It did not ask the court to dismiss the charge of criminal negligence, but did dispute the family's claim that there was a 'parental loss of consortium' and 'sibling loss of 
consortium' - the legal terms for when an incident affects relationships.

Surgeon: Dr Michael Rees continues to work at the hospital but two nurses have been fired

There is 'no right to 
compensation for parental loss of consortium of an adult,' it said. 'There is no right to compensation for sibling loss of
consortium in a non-death case.'

Larry
Burns, the university's vice president for external affairs, said he 
did not know how much the medical center paid the family, including the cost of the trip to Colorado.

After the mix-up, live-donor kidney transplants 
were suspended voluntarily at the medical center - and there was a host of staff changes.

Dr. Michael Rees, who performed the surgery, still works at the medical center while two nurses, Moore and Melanie Lemay, no longer work there and the administrator of surgical services, Edwin Hall, was 
placed on paid administrative leave.

Moore, who threw away the slush machine contents before the surgery was over, resigned on 
September 10 last year, and the hospital fired Lemay, a full-time nurse.

Lemay, who took over when Moore went on a lunch break, did not update her on
the status of the surgery when she returned from her break, disciplinary records showed, the Blade reported.

She has now sued the hospital for wrongful discharge, 
defamation, slander, and libel and seeks damages exceeding $25,000.This kind of accident is unheard of in
organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the 
kidney, Dr William Harmon, director of kidney transplantation at Boston 
Children's Hospital, told the Blade.

Disastrous error: An investigation is underway at the University of Toledo Medical Center after a nurse
accidentally disposed of a kidney a man donated for his sick sister

Humans do not need two kidneys to live, the body
can support life with only one. If one functional kidney is missing 
from birth, the other kidney can grow to reach a size similar to the 
combined weight of two kidneys

'This
is unfortunately what medicine is like - it is not perfect, and there 
have been far worse cases where the donor has died,' Harmon said.

There
were 16,816 kidney transplants nationwide last year from live donors 
and from those who consented to organ donation through state registries 
should they die from an illness or accident, the newspaper reported.

Last
year, 136 people in Ohio died waiting for a kidney, and 4,711 people 
died nationally waiting for a kidney, the newspaper reported.
