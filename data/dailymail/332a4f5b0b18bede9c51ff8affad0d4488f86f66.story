A wealthy businessman who illegally claimed more than £35,000 in benefits despite owning a £2million property empire has been jailed.

Mohsen Sabet, 48, had over £800,000 stashed in a string of bank accounts and ran two shops.

But he still tried to get away with claiming thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money over seven years.

Wood Green Crown Court heard Mohsen Sabet, 48, illegally claimed more than £35,000 in benefits despite owning a £2million property empire

Sabet even changed his name from Mohsen Aboudarda by deed poll in 2004 to avoid being caught out by the three local authorities he deceived, Wood Green Crown Court heard.

He was eventually exposed by Barnet Council's fraud squad after suspicions were raised by the neighbouring authority in Enfield, London.

Sabet, from Whetstone, London, was jailed for nine months on March 7 after pleading guilty to ten charges of benefit fraud.

Sentencing, Judge James Patrick described the frauds as 'systematic, deliberate and dishonest, motivated by greed and a sense of personal injustice'.

Barnet Council leader Richard Cornelius said: 'This was a truly brazen attempt by a man who owned a business and significant assets to cheat the system and claim benefits which are intended to help those in genuine need.'

The court heard Sabet illegally claimed housing and council tax benefit from Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Councils, as well as receiving financial assistance from the Department for Work and Pensions.

This included more than £6,500 from Barnet Council under his previous name of Mohsen Aboudarda.

They found he owned and was running two luggage shops in Enfield and Tottenham and that he owned several homes in the name of Sabet.

The benefits cheat also owned four properties, three of them outright, and had 17 different bank accounts at one time containing a total of £800,000.

He later also admitted to having assets in Iran worth more than £1million.

Confiscation proceedings have now been initiated to recover the money Sabet illegally claimed.
