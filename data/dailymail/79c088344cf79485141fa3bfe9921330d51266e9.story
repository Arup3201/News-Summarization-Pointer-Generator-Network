A female Olympic gold medalist has used her phenomenal strength to restrain four speeding motorbikes - each pulling with 1,050lbs of force in opposite directions – with her arms, as a part of her most recent extreme stunt.

Juli Moody, a 37-year-old from California, has earned herself the nickname 'The Female Human Link' because of her extraordinary ability to stall moving motorcycles by pulling the vehicles' attached restraints with her crossed arms.

And the former Olympic Power Lifting medal winner, who first hit the headlines after holding back two screaming Harley Davidsons in a haze of tire smoke and burning rubber, has now taken her daring trick up a notch by adding two more motorcycles to the original equation.

Ms Moody held the four bikes for a little over a minute as they burned out in opposite directions - using no brakes.

She is the only woman in the world to perform the stunt with one, two and four motorcycles, holding the official world record for all of three of the tricks. 

According to Ms Moody's website, she will soon attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the heaviest vehicle pulled 100ft by a female, as well as the longest time restraining two Cessna aircrafts by a female.

The latter is a new category for women, which the Guinness World Records organization only decided to open following her personal request. 

A video of Ms Moody having her bicep measured shows that her flexed upper arm has a circumference of more than 16 inches. 

'I am pretty happy,' she said of the measurement. 'That's great.'

Ms Moody isn't the only woman who is testing the limits of her physical strength.

Julia Vins, an 18-year-old from Russia, is known as 'muscle Barbie' because she has the face of a porcelain doll but a hulk-like body that enables her to deadlift 400lbs. 

The teen entered the World Powerlifting Championships in Moscow in 2014 and achieved three world records after squatting 396lbs, bench pressing 230lbs and deadlifting 364lbs.

Miss Vins, who has said that she wants to get as big as possible, has nearly 50,000 Instagram followers.
