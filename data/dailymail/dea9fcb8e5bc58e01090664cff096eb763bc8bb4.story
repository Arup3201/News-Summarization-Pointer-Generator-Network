Reality TV star and conservative firebrand Sarah Palin said today she's 'interested' in running for president in 2016 but stopped short of saying she'd actually seek higher office.

'Yeah, I mean, of course, when you have a servant’s heart, when you know that there is opportunity to do all you can to put yourself forward in the name of offering service, anybody would be interested,' Palin told ABC News reporter Neal Karlinsky.

Later stating, 'America has had enough of seeing that...sign on the Oval Office door saying, "No Girls Allowed." ' 

'It doesn't necessarily have to be me though,' she said.

GIRL POWER: 'America has had enough of seeing that...sign on the Oval Office door saying, "No Girls Allowed," ' Palin said

NOM NOM NOM: Palin made the comments while serving wild boar chili to the Salvation Army in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday. She was hosting an episode of Sportsman Channel program Hunt.Fish.Feed

ABC News caught up with Palin while she was serving wild boar chili to the homeless at a Las Vegas, Nevada, Salvation Army for an episode of Sportsman Channel program Hunt.Fish.Feed.

She's also in the midst of promoting her hunting show, Amazing Alaska, about to begin its second season.

Palin said the GOP needs to nominate a candidate 'who can take on Hillary' and 'show the nation what it is going to take to get the country back on the right track.'

'Because we can't afford status quo,' the former Alaska governor said in a clip of the interview released by ABC this afternoon. 'Status quo lately has been Latin for, "We're getting screwed,' and status quo has got to go.' 

The Republican nominee out to be someone can 'turn things around, someone who will, in some respects, I don’t know, maybe be considered a bit avant garde, to the establishment anyway, because this next person has got to realize this is war, this is war for our hunters’ future,' she said at another point in the interview, according to ABC. 

Asked about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's candidacy and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Palin snarked, 'I can’t wait for new energy.'

Moments later asserting that the GOP primary 'had better be a competition and not a coronation.' 

Palin, the 2008 vice presidential nominee, said she doesn't 'have to be' the Republican candidate for president but she's 'happy to drive that competition, because competition will make everyone better and produce more and be more candid regarding their solutions they will offer this country.

'I am very interested in that competitive process and, again, not necessarily me.'

The hard-charging, Tea Party icon appears to have a change of heart in the last week about the Oval Office needing a female touch.

'I don't give a flying flip about what gender the person will be,' Palin told Inside Edition after host Deborah Norville asker her about the importance of electing a female president.

'I want the absolute best because America deserves the best, in terms of leadership, getting this country on the right track,' she continued. 

She ultimately concluded 'it would be nice' to have a woman president, though, 'and it will be nice to see women jump into the ring.'

Voicing her support for female candidates in December, Palin told Extra TV, 'I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot.'
