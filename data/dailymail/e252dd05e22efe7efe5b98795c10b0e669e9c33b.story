A selfless daughter who surprised her ailing father with the gift of life after offering to donate him her kidney is desperately trying to raise the $30,000 the family needs to pay for the procedure.

Felicia Mulero, who lives in Kansas with her young son, knew her father Herminio Mulero, 50, was battling stage-five kidney disease in Florida. But instead of letting him wait for a kidney on the transplant list, the 24-year-old quietly underwent tests to see if she could be a viable match for his much-needed organ donation. 

'It's so amazing to me that I can help save my dad; I can help save a life - and it's my dad's,' Felicia explained in a video on the GoFundMe page her family created to raise money for the costs surrounding the surgery. 

Priceless gift: Felicia can be seen cuddling up with her father Herminio Mulero. The 24-year-old secretly planned on giving him her kidney but waited to see if she was a match before sharing the life-saving news

Family ties: Felicia and Herminio shared a special moment on the beach. The 50-year-old dad has been battling stage-five kidney disease in Florida and was awaiting an organ donation on the transplant list

Herminio, who has been suffering from kidney problems for the past seven years, has been relying on daily dialysis to keep him alive as he awaits an organ donation. 

'The waiting list could take months, years you really don’t know they have to find a match,' he told Bay News 9. 

He had no idea that his daughter was secretly going through the process to give him her kidney.

Herminio's wife Kathleen explained to the outlet that Felicia matches four markers when most children only match three out of six. 

The father-daughter duo are currently going through the final stages of testing to make sure that she can proceed with the organ donation.

'I’m very thankful to have a beautiful daughter who has very compassionate heart,' Herminio said.

While Felicia's selfless donation will most likely save her father's life, the family also has financial worries to consider.

Last month, the family created their GoFundMe page in hopes of raising $30,000 for the expenses not covered by Herminio's insurance, in addition to the cost of Felicia's travel and recovery.

The page states that Herminio needs at least $8,000 worth of emergency medications before they will schedule the surgery. He will also require expensive medications after the procedure.

Meanwhile, Felicia, who is also parent, will need money to travel, pay her bills and find childcare for her son while she recovers. 

Although the family has reached nearly $5,000, they are still far from their original goal. 

On the page, Felicia noted that she and her father have always been close, even after she moved to the Midwest when she was 13 years old. 

She added that the distance between them has been become especially difficult because of his illness.

'I cannot wait to get through the rest of these tests to know for sure that I can do this and I can save him and I won’t be crushed because he’s not going to get the transplant,' she said. 

'I’m going to be the one who’s going to do it, and I’m going all the way in - 100per cent, full force, it’s going to happen.'
