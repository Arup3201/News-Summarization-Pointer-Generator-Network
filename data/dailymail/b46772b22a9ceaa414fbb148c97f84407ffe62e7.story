Scunnered. Not just a localised colloquial term to sum up the mood of Rangers fans watching their club pummelled and pilloried from all angles at the moment, but a fair enough way of describing exactly how Ally McCoist and the Ibrox board feel about each other.

As a settlement is finalised to end a business relationship utterly lacking in mutual respect, Sportsmail examines how they reached this point — and what finally caused the façade of public co-operation to crumble.

Ally McCoist has left Rangers, nine days after he offered his resignation to the club

Why Ally was fed up with Rangers

Redundancies to long-serving members of staff, not deemed crucial to the football department but seen by many as part of the fabric of Rangers, are cited as the trigger for McCoist’s decision to hand in his notice.

If that was the final straw, though, it is fair to say that the spine of the dromedary was already near breaking long before the manager penned his farewell letter.

Trying to compile a list of all the nonsense McCoist has had to deal with during his time at the helm is, quite frankly, a case of choosing what to leave out. So apologies if your ‘favourite’ scandal/farce/calamity isn’t included.

Starting with the biggest bumps in the road first, the act of the club simply sliding into administration under the guidance of Craig Whyte — he of the garbled gabbling and, apparently, muddled mathematics — effectively killed off Rangers’ chances of winning the title in Ally’s first season at the helm.

Oh sure, he had already seen his team blow a 15-point lead to be overtaken by Celtic, suggesting that they might have lost the race regardless. But the 10-point deduction did for any lingering chances.

If plunging into insolvency was bad enough, the arrival of Charles Green’s consortium as ‘saviours’ would not have gone down well with a man who, it is understood, hoped to see any combination of Brian Kennedy, Dave King and the Blue Knights at the helm.

When Green then fails to get his Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) accepted, forcing the club into liquidation, fans turned to McCoist as the one man they could trust. The one man who famously refused to walk away.

Rangers fans have shown great support for McCoist in the past, with his loyalty a key feature

Forced to start all over again in the bottom tier of Scottish football, then hit with a transfer embargo that gave him 42 days to rebuild a decimated squad, McCoist was faced with the perfect storm of managerial crises. Any one of which would have been a good enough excuse to call it a day, just over a year into the job.

Since then, he has shrugged aside direct public criticism from the increasingly buffoon-like Green, offered his vocal support to an ever-changing cast of chief executives, some of which he might actually have trusted, and agreed to cut his — admittedly excessive — salary by almost 50 per cent.

Finally, as those one-off bad results in the cup competitions started to cluster together in a Championship season that must end with promotion, came the whispering campaign, the blame, the cuts.

From dealing with all that had come his way with fortitude and, for the most part, good cheer, the lawyered-up McCoist, who stuck to the ‘no-comment’ line when pressed on his resignation on the Friday night before his team lost at Queen of the South, looked like a man at the end of his tether. Scunnered.

Why Rangers grew fed up with Ally

How do you sack a manager who has won back-to-back titles by record margins? A head coach who was already a club legend as a player — and assistant to the most popular gaffer in Rangers’ modern history?

Well, those who make even a half-hearted attempt at balancing the books start by calculating what keeping him in place would have cost the club. And whether they can possibly survive without returning to Scottish football’s top flight at the first attempt.

Despite throwing away that huge lead over Celtic in season 2011-12, McCoist became effectively untouchable when he took on the mantle of front man, public face and spiritual leader to Rangers fans during the administration crisis.

Within 24 hours of the club sliding into insolvency, Super Ally gained instant legend status when, asked if he was considering his own future, he declared: ‘At Rangers, we don’t do walking away.’

Even the most ardent brand of hero worship only lasts so long, however.

If that first season was just about winning the title, subsequent cup failures began to ebb away at confidence in the former striker who had been such an integral part of Walter Smith’s successful second coming at Ibrox.

In August 2013, they lost 2-1 away to Forfar in the first round of the League Cup. If that was painful, their loss to Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup Final in April 2014 was seen by many as a turning point for the manager’s popularity.

Defeat to Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup Final last season was a turning point for McCoist

Taken on its own, last month’s disaster in the Petrofac Training Cup at Alloa — blowing a 2-0 lead to lose three late goals against part-time opposition — would have been enough reason for a lot of fans to consider his time was up.

The fact that yet another cup howler came during an underwhelming Championship campaign, with home-and-away losses to leaders Hearts and a defeat to Hibs at Ibrox already on the cards, irrevocably tipped the balance against McCoist.

Suddenly, every aspect of his management has been open to question, from a signing policy that saw senior professionals poached from top-flight clubs, to their subsequent failure to blow away lower-league opposition.

With the prospect of automatic promotion slipping ever further out of sight, the board’s hand was only stayed by a lack of cash needed to pay off the manager.

McCoist’s resignation brought the subject to a head. Leaving the cash-strapped board thoroughly, well, scunnered.
