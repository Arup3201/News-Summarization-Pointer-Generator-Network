Allegations: Greg Bucceroni, 48, claims to have been paid for sex with Brooklyn Poly Prep coach Phil Foglietta

A man, describing himself as a former child prostitute, claimed to 
have had sex with a football coach who belonged to a pedophile 
ring which included Jerry Sandusky.

Greg Bucceroni, now 48, said he was paid for sex as a teenager by former Brooklyn Poly Prep coach Phil Foglietta in 1979.

Foglietta, who is now dead, has been accused of raping and assaulting students at
the New York prep school over a 20-year period, according to the New 
York Daily News.

In a letter sent to authorities at Poly Prep this week, Bucceroni said he met Foglietta as a teenager through Second Mile charity in Pennsylvania.

The organization was started by Sandusky and used as a cover for the years of sexual abuse he inflicted on vulnerable boys.

The disgraced Penn State coach was 
convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse in June and is facing life in 
prison when convicted next month.

Bucceroni described himself as a 'child prostitute' who was used by a pedophile ring including Sandusky, Foglietta,
now-deceased Philadelphia businessman Ed Savitz and former Wharton 
School of Business professor Lawrence Scott Ward.

Ward is currently in jail for smuggling child porn. Savitz was charged with sexual abuse in 1992 but died of AIDS before 
his trial was due to begin.

Bucceroni wrote in the letter that for three years he was abused by a pedophile ring in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

He wrote: 'Due to time constraints, Sandusky became
unavailable and I was introduced to Phil Foglietta by Ed Savitz & 
Jerry Sandusky.

'Foglietta was introduced to us as Coach Phil who coached
youth football in NYC. Foglietta agreed to pay $200.00 for child sex 
and followed us back to a Philadelphia hotel, myself [sic] ad another 
child prostitute then engaged coach Phil in child sex.'

Cover up: Poly Prep school has been accused of hiding football coach Phil Foglietta's sexual abuse in a scandal that mirrors the sordid goings-on by Sandusky at Penn State

A sexual abuse lawsuit was filed in 2009 by ten former students and two day campers at Poly Prep.

At a hearing last Friday, a district court judge urged plaintiffs and the school's lawyers to reach a settlement but so far no deal has been struck.

Poly prep school was accused of covering up the former football coach's sexual abuse of young boys in a case that shockingly mirrors the Penn State scandal.

A lawyer representing the 12 victims argued that the abuse could have been prevented had the school not buried the football coach’s abuse in a bid to protect its reputation and athletic program.

Kevin Mulhearn claims that the 
school’s cover-up prevented Foglietta’s victims from taking legal action
against the school in time, before the statute of limitations expired.

Mulhearn, who is also a former student, has also accused Poly Prep of withholding documents and providing misleading testimony. 

The cover-up reportedly began in 1966 when one alleged victim named William Jackson told J. Folwell Scull, who was headmaster at the time, that he had been abused by Foglietta. 

The
school reportedly conducted a bogus investigation and the former 
student was threatened with expulsion if he continued to voice his 
allegations.

A few 
years later, another football player named John Marino told officials 
that he had seen Foglietta abusing boys on ten different occasions but 
he was branded a troublemaker.

The
cover-up continued for another 25 years until David Hiltbrand, a 
Philadelphia-based journalist and former student, told of the abuse he 
had suffered at the hands of the coach and wrote about the scandal.

He was contacted by Mulhearn, who filed the civil suit which seeks damages of $20 million for each of the plaintiffs, in 2009.  Mulhearn is accusing the school of fraud, a charge Poly Prep argues is irrelevant because the plaintiffs did not sue in time.

During a hearing in June this year, U.S. Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak ruled that there was evidence that Poly Prep tried to mislead the plaintiffs and the court.

'The law provides that Poly Prep has an in loco parentis supervisory standard over kids. That means the school is acting in place of a parent in the care and protection of a child,' Mulhearn said.

'A responsible parent would not have swept this under the rug.’

The scandal mirrors the accusations leveled at staff at Penn State.

Scandal: Poly Prep in Brooklyn, New York has been accused of covering up sexual abuse allegations stretching back decades

The university's internal investigation released a final report in July describing how the University's top officials 'repeatedly concealed critical facts' about former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse of young boys for more than a decade.

The report told of how the four administrators knew about an assault that took place in 1998 but showed 'callous disregard' for victims by covering it up and keeping the situation quiet so as to avoid bad publicity.

Shocking testimony from a war veteran janitor showed the 'culture of reverence' for football that blinded anyone from reporting the wrongdoing in fear that 'they'd get rid of us all'.

'The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized,’ the Freeh report states.

In the years following the initial sex assault, seven more boys were victimized which could have been prevented if the men had reported Sandusky to the police immediately.
