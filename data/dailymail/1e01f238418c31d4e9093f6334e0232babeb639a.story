A protester in Ferguson was arrested during a demonstration on Thursday night - and live-tweeted her entire experience.

Brittany Ferrell, a nursing student at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, was one of 13 people detained by officers in the conflicted Missouri city for 'noise disruption'.

The detention has sparked an investigation by the American Civil Liberties Union as lawyers accuse officers of overstretching their powers.

Arrested: This is Brittany Ferrell, the nursing student and protester who live-tweeted her arrest in Ferguson

Tweeting in handcuffs, she then took her thousands of followers through the uncertain few hours before the nine women and four men eventually learned what they had done wrong and managed to secure their release.

She started with the tweet: 'We are all arrested', apparently referring to herself an other members of the advocacy group Millenial Activists United.

'Tweeting while cuffed,' she wrote, adding: 'We were arrested while on the side walk by the way'.

According to her Twitter feed, she was piled into a wagon with seven other people and not told where they were going.

Enraged, she then reported the reason the group was arrested: 'They said we violated the "noise" ordinance" it's been 50+ days... NOW they effort a noise ordinance. Bull****'.

The group started chanting 'no justice, no peace!' in the back of the wagon. 'They think it's a game,' she said.

Her followers informed her clergy were en route to the prison to offer support.

Arriving at St Ann Police Station, they were dressed in orange jumpsuits, placed in a cell and 'treated like criminals', while officers said the bail would be doubled for anyone who had been arrested before.

Ms Ferrell's bail was set at $2,300, she said.

More than three hours after the arrest they were informed they would be released before the night was over, but Ms Ferrell said: 'no one can give us clear answers on anything though. aside from the fact that we will be out and that people are working on it now.'

She added: 'Again, all 13 of us are still in jail,' tweeting pictures of the four men and eight women she was sat with.

Around an hour later, after crowds swarmed around the police station, the group was released.

Local media reported protesters lay on the ground around the arrestees' cars to stop them from being towed.

Many of the jail bonds were waived, according to the Argus Streaming News account on Twitter, but not for all. 

Later, Ms Ferrell told her followers: 'They straight criminalized us. made us stand in a cage. asked us if they turned their backs would we cause trouble. we are protestors!'

'The way we've been treated you would think WE are murderers, con artists, robbers. the mentality of the officers that handled us was insane.'

Tony Rothert, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union office in St. Louis, said several complaints have been lodged about Thursday's arrests and the ACLU is investigating.

'There do appear to be, if not bogus, at least unnecessary arrests,' said Rothert, who had no details about why the protesters were arrested. He also questioned why they'd be jailed on a 24-hour hold.

'Holding people unnecessarily long, arresting them when it's not necessary — that's an indication of overreach,' Rothert said. 'It certainly appears that the purpose is to discourage people from coming to Ferguson to protest.'

Investigation: Lawyers will now launch an investigation into unnecessary arrests made by Ferguson police

Conflict: Last week, the police department was condemned by the Department of Justice for refusing to effect change as it emerged numerous officers were still not wearing identification or covering their badges

Hundreds of people have been arrested during nearly two months of protests in Ferguson, including journalists and clergy members. 

The incident comes amid volatile outbursts in the city, where citizens and the Department of Justice are accusing police of failing to take action to repair racial divides.

In a letter to the Ferguson Police Department (FPD) last Tuesday, the department said its own investigators have spotted officers without name tags and refusing to identify themselves to members of the public.

The practise violates FPD rules, the department pointed out, and is illegal in many states.

It added: 'The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to community members that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity'.

Just days later the letter was followed by a second on Friday, as it emerged the first one had been ignored.

'It further was reported to us that some officers affirmatively displaying these bracelets had black tape over their name plates. 

'The practice of not wearing, or obscuring, name plates violates your own department's policies, which we advised you earlier this week when we requested that you end the practice imrnediately.'

The second letter also addressed the news that officers were sporting 'I Am Darren Wilson' bracelets in an apparent show of solidarity to the man that shot Michael Brown.
