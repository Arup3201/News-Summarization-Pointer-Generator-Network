Last seen soaking up rays on a Hawaiian beach while her actor beau Bradley Cooper filmed scenes for his latest movie, Suki Waterhouse plays the role of glamorous groupie very well.

Now the cool blonde has been snapped up by fashion brand sass & bide to rock its latest collection in a shoot that seems to be inspired by A-listers and their posses.

And 21-year-old Suki proves she isn't just a pretty face by styling the designer shoot, as well as modelling in it and illustrating a series of behind-the-scenes shots.

The shoot by Andrew de Francesco is meant to give a glimpse in to the life of Suki as a model, actress and artist. Set in a Brooklyn Brownstone the candid pictures show off pretty Suki's eccentric side as she poses in a mixture of pieces from the brand's denim, ready-to-wear and gallery pieces.

As the face of the autumn/winter 2013 digital campaign the brand wanted to show Suki as r'aw, real and confident': 'Suki embodies the spirit of the brand' said Heidi Middleton, Creative Director sass & bide. 'She has a curious mind and looks at the world in an original way - we felt an instant connection to her.'

Middleton continued, 'We wanted Suki’s creativity to shine. In the behind-the-scenes images we’ve provided an insight into who Suki is as an artist, a photographer, a model. That was interesting to us'.

Speaking to the Telegraph about her personal style and her level of creative involvement in the shoot Suki said: 'I'm a real chameleon with my style and I use outfits to express myself and the character I want to be that day.

'It's a lovely thing when brands allow you to bring your own creative 
flair. It made the whole experience even more enjoyable and I loved the 
Sass and Bide collection so I was spoilt for choice.'

The £295 beaded bolero jacket (pictured above, worn with distressed jeans) is Suki's favourite piece and her online picks also include new season rock chic staples like the £475 leather and feather capelet and the £295 embellished bodysuit.
