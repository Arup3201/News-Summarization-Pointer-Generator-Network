Andy Murray will defy the sceptics over his working relationship with Amelie Mauresmo by striking a more substantial coaching deal than expected with the former women’s Wimbledon champion.

The 27 year-old Scot, who returns to action this week at the Canadian Open in Toronto, appears to have persuaded Mauresmo to travel 25 weeks per year with him, which in top level tennis terms amounts to a full-blown commitment.

Some doubted how much time she would be prepared to give to Murray, or whether she wanted to do the travelling necessary, but she is set to put in plenty more weeks than Ivan Lendl was doing towards the end of his tenure as coach. 

Staying together: Andy Murray will defy the sceptics over his working relationship with Amelie Mauresmo by striking a more substantial coaching deal

Mauresmo has spent weeks at Murray’s recent post-Wimbledon training camp in Miami – another thing that some doubted she would attend – and has accompanied him to Canada as preparations for the US Open start in earnest.

A notable absentee from Toronto, I understand, will be Dani Vallverdu, his assistant coach and long-time cornerstone of his support staff. He is known to have been disturbed that he was not initially kept in the loop about Mauresmo’s appointment, only finding out when its likelihood was revealed by Sportsmail.

He is said to have smoothed that over with his long-time friend, who explained that the whole French Open-Wimbledon period was the most difficult in which to settle coaching arrangements. Vallverdu gets on well with the ex French player, but the new structure around Murray will not see him travelling everywhere with the Scot as happened before.

The Venezuelan will still work with Murray, but has this week off and then will join up with him for the Masters level event in Cincinatti that immediately follows Toronto.

The delay of an official announcement about Mauresmo seems to have been caused by it being holiday time and relevant lawyers drawing up the paperwork being on vacation.

Murray swiftly returned to training following his surprise Wimbledon quarter final exit. He is said to have been pleased with the training block in Florida and how it has gone with Mauresmo, who has firm ideas but a more consensual approach than Lendl, who was very much a ‘my way or the highway’ type of operator.

This week represents the start of a new phase of the Scot’s career in many senses, as he no longer carries around the Wimbledon champion tag, is fully over his back surgery, and down to number ten in the rankings.

When the draw for Toronto came out on Friday night he was slightly shielded from his new reality by being bumped up into the top eight seedings and therefore getting a bye, only due to the long-term absence of Juan Martin Del Potro and the shock withdrawal of Rafael Nadal with a wrist injury.

Murray’s first opponent will be either Colombian Santiago Giraldo or Nadal’s conqueror at Wimbledon, Australian Nick Kyrgios. Should he survive that he may face Novak Djokovic in the quarter finals. 

Frustration: Murray was knocked out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage against Grigor Dimitrov

The British number one has made clear that he will be taking to the two Masters level events ahead of Flushing Meadows with due seriousness as he tries to regain momentum for New York.

He is said to be very motivated and, given that he only has a relatively paltry 630 ranking points to defend for the rest of the year, it can be expected that by the end of 2014 he will be back among the top seeds.

Nadal, on the other hand, may take quite a ranking hit if the injury to his right wrist tendon does not clear. He excelled this time last year, winning Canada, Cincinatti and the U.S Open, and so has nearly a third of his computer points to defend in the next five weeks.

While the damage to his tendon is not said to be severe any wrist problem cannot be easily dismissed in tennis and it is difficult to see him lining up in New York having not played since the Kyrgios upset.

Djokovic got married after Wimbledon and his wife Jelena is soon expecting their first child, so his life is about to become more complicated. Other issues to look out for as tennis revives from its post-Wimbledon slumbers are whether Roger Federer – turning 33 this week - can keep his SW19 momentum going and if Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic can follow up on their semi-final appearances there.
