'Sweet Feet': Nine-year-old girl Sam Gordon has become one of the fastest children in her local football league in Utah

There are plenty of boys chasing this little girl but they are not after a kiss on the school playground – they are trying to tackle her on the football pitch.

Only problem is that nine-year-old Sam Gordon is too fast for them to catch, earning her the nickname Sweet Feet.

What started as a way to keep up with 
her big brother, has turned Sam into a star player in her local, 
all-boys football league in Utah, becoming one of the fastest children 
in the Salt Lake City area ‘Gremlins’ league as well as breaking and 
making tackles among the much bigger players.

After outrunning the boys in various speed and agility drills, Sam was made quarterback for her team.

Now
 a video posted online by her father Brent Gordon showing her play 
highlights has gone viral as people continue to be amazed at what the 
young, fearless girl can do and she has only been playing for a year.

Her coach Chris Staib was quoted by Yahoo!Sports saying: ‘She could cut and follow blocks like a college football player.’

Asked about the authenticity of the video, he said: ‘Oh it's real. That's her. I was there for all of that.’

Remember the name: Sam Gordon's coach Chris Staib say the 9-year-old - who doesn't even weigh 60lbs - can 'cut and follow blocks like a college football player'

Weighing not even 60 pounds, Sam is playing in a team of much bigger boys including a boy who weighs more than 150 pounds and nicknamed Tank but according to Mr Staib, Sam will even tackle Tank if she gets the chance.

Despite being so much smaller than all the other players, Mr Gordon said Sam is used to playing rough.

He said from his office in Idaho: ‘I started her out in soccer at four-years-old and we would play out in the yard and my son's friends were pretty aggressive and rough. 

‘She could really handle a lot of the physical play. There were some games where she'd fall down and just keep going. She would get kicked in the face, kicked in the gut and just keep going.’

To keep up with her big brother: Sam (centre) started playing to keep up with the boys and so can handle the physicality of the game as well as outrunning most players on the field, some two years older than her

Mr Gordon said that Sam told her: ‘Some kids, right before the contact, they stop. ‘I don't. I just hit 'em.’

He said: ‘That's not something I taught her.’

Mr Gordon said it took her some time to adjust when she first started playing.

He said: ‘She had a little bit of a struggle.

‘The team lost a couple of games. Since she was the primary ball carrier, she felt a lot of pressure to win. She felt blame for losing.

‘With Sam, I keep questioning myself. Am I trying to make it something it's not because I'm her dad? I asked my brother, “OK, am I just being a crazy dad here? Or is this really cool?”’
