Come back: Alistair Darling is being touted amongst some Labour MPs as a replacement for Ed Miliband

Alistair Darling is being touted as a ‘compromise’ Labour leadership candidate if Ed Miliband is forced to quit.

Labour MPs have privately floated the idea of the former Chancellor taking the helm as a ‘John Major figure’ if Mr Miliband is unable to kickstart his faltering leadership.

The Labour leader will attempt a relaunch next week amid growing unease that voters think he is not a credible prime minister.

Labour peer Lord Glasman, a policy guru to Mr Miliband, this week admitted the party appears to have ‘no strategy, no narrative and little energy’ under his leadership.

Speculation about a potential replacement for Mr Miliband is focused on Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, who easily topped the last ballot of Labour MPs to elect a Shadow Cabinet.

But Mr Darling is being mentioned privately as a possibility, though it is far from clear he could be persuaded to stand and would certainly not wield the knife against Mr Miliband.

Senior Tories would not welcome a return to the frontline for Mr Darling, who they believe was the one senior member of the last government to emerge from the financial crisis with any credit.

He was attacked by allies of Gordon Brown for correctly warning Britain faced the biggest economic crisis for 60 years and he pushed for the last government to accept the need for the deepest public spending cuts since the days of Margaret Thatcher. Asked before the last general election if he would stand in any future Labour leadership contest, Mr Darling replied: ‘Me? No, no.’

But in an interview with Total Politics magazine, he hinted at a return to the fray. ‘I said I’d take a year’s break [after the 2010 election] and see how I felt,’ he said.

‘I did take a year’s break. I did see how I felt. I decided that I’d like another year and here I am.’

Pressure: Ed Miliband is feeling the heat as Labour leader, with some backbenchers rumoured to be on the lookout for a new man at the helm

Asked if he expected to return to frontline politics at that point, Mr Darling said: ‘I don’t know. I’m in no hurry and no-one’s putting me under any pressure.’

One Labour source said: ‘This speculation has been going on for a while.

‘I’m not sure whether he’d ever do it, but people were disappointed he stood down and some are saying he would be the best leader we could have at the moment, when politics is all about the economy.

‘Voters basically trusted him and were reassured by him.’ A friend of Mr Darling, however, said they doubted he would regard himself as a potential candidate, saying: ‘He thinks the bus has moved on and that there’s a new generation.’

Instead they suggested he could return as Shadow Chancellor under a new leader – either Miss Cooper or Mr Miliband’s brother David.

Labour was yesterday forced to dismiss claims of a split over economic policy after Jim Murphy – the most senior Blairite remaining on the front line – said the party needed to show ‘credibility’ by explaining where it would make cuts.

The party’s defence spokesman said he accepted £5billion-worth of the Government’s military cuts and acknowledged that Labour would have to make reductions if it won power.

‘It is important to be both credible and popular when it comes to defence investment and the economics of defence,’ Mr Murphy said.

‘At a time on defence when the Government is neither credible nor popular it is compulsory that Labour is both.’

Treasury minister Chloe Smith said the remarks by Mr Murphy – who was joint campaign manager for David Miliband’s 2010 leadership campaign – amounted to an ‘extraordinary attack’ on Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls.

‘This is the latest blow to Ed Miliband as even his own Shadow Cabinet are losing confidence in Labour’s economic policy,’ she said.
