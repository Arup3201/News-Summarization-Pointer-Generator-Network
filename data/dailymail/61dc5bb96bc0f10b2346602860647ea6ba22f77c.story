Tiring: Prince Charles has had a long wait - the longest ever

The birth of baby George, a boost in sales for Duchy's Originals - and Prince Charles has broken a record to add to his year of milestones - although this one may come with a pinch of frustration.

The Prince of Wales - who has in the past joked about being 'impatient' and about 'running out of time' -  today become the oldest heir to the throne for almost 300 year, successor to Queen Elizabeth II, who at the age of 87 holds the title of oldest monarch in British history.

The oldest heir apparent until today was William IV, who became monarch in June 1830, aged 64 years, ten months and five days, on the death of his father George III.

William IV died without an heir in 1837 and was succeeded by his niece - Queen Victoria, who went on to become the country's longest reigning monarch, with 63 years on the throne.

He still has Sophia of Hanover to beat as the oldest heir to the throne.

The princess died aged 83 in 1714, a few months before Queen Anne died.

Charles became heir apparent on the death of his grandfather George VI, when his mother succeeded to the throne on February 6 1952.

The Prince was just three years old at the time and from a young age has been groomed to be king.

Charles is already the longest serving heir to the throne having passed, a number of years ago, the previous record set by Edward VII who became monarch aged 59, when his mother Queen Victoria died in 1901.

The Prince became a grandfather for the first time in July when Prince George was born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Before the birth the heir to the throne said he was 'thrilled' and even joked about how the latest development in his eventful life had come at the age of 64.

He said: 'It’s a very nice thought to become a grandfather in my old age, if I can say so.'

And with the Queen still in excellent health - despite a few hospital visits - he could be in for an even longer wait.

Aside from a brief hospital visit in March this year - a precautionary measure, the Palace said, while she was assessed for the symptoms of the stomach bug gastroentiritis, she has not had a hospital stay for ten years.

And despite his positive comments about being an old grandfather, the Prince has in the past hinted that he is feeling the long wait.

During a visit to Dumfries House in East Ayrshire last year, he recorded a film for the Clarence House website in which the then 64-year-old heir suggested his time as monarch might be cut short.

He said: 'Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes of course I am.'

He added: “I’ll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffed it if I’m not careful.'

And even before then, Charles made a number of comments regarding his time as heir.

In 1992, on the eve of the Queen’s 40th anniversary on the throne, he attended the funeral of his father-in-law, the 8th Earl Spencer, where he is believed to have remarked to Charles Spencer, his then brother-in-law: 'You are fortunate enough to have succeeded to the title when still young.'

In 2004, a Guards officer at Wellington Barracks who congratulated him on his 56th birthday got the response: 'I’m now at the age at which my grandfather died.'

Royal biographer Penny Junor said: 'He is impatient, but when he becomes king, his activities and all the projects he most enjoys where he can make a difference, will be seriously curtailed. 

Heirs to the throne: The Queen looks out from Buckingham Palace, engaged in conversation with Prince William... while Charles, the first in line to the throne, looks on

'He has spent an awful lot of his life searching for a role, but I think he does now feel fulfilled pursuing his various interests.'

And with the wedding of Prince William to Catherine last year, Prince Charles also must cope with being sidelined by the younger members of his family.

A poll in July - at the time of the birth of Prince George - named the most popular royals after the Queen as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with Prince Harry.

And although 42 per cent of those surveyed by the ComRes poll said Prince Charles should be the next heir to the throne, 38 per cent were in favour of Prince William being the next king.
