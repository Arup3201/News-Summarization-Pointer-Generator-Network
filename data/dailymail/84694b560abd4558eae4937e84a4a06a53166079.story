Rejected: Suspected mass-murderer James Holmes, 24, was rejected from joining a Colorado gun club just weeks before his horrific shooting spree

Suspected mass-murderer James Holmes was rejected from joining a Colorado gun club just weeks before his horrific shooting spree, because the message on his answering machine was 'bizarre and freaky'.

The 24-year-old who killed 12 people and injured scores more when he opened fire at a midnight screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' on Friday, applied for membership to the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 but owner Glenn Rotkovich banned the man from the club after being unnerved by his 'incoherent, rambling' message.

'I called to see if he could come down for an orientation and I got his answering machine and the message was just bizarre, freaky,' Mr Rotkovich told MailOnline.

'I thought it was weird and strange. I called a couple more times and then decided not to call again because of the nature of his answering message.

'I gave my staff his name - James Holmes - and told everyone here to get me if he shows up at the range. I wanted to know who he was before we considered doing anything with him, let alone make him a member. He was flagged.'

MailOnline got hold of the application form that Holmes sent through to the Range, which detailed his residential address, email address, his marital status as single and birthday. It also lists his mother, Arlene, as his emergency contact.

Mr Rotkovich said he initially thought the gunman was drunk on the answering message because he was slurring his words, but on subsequent listens realised the creepy voice was deliberate.

'The message was guttural, spoken with a deep voice, incoherent and rambling,' he said.

'I could make out that he said his name was James but not a lot else. On first listen I thought he might have been drunk but after I'd heard it a few more times I realised it was deliberate. He meant it to sound that way.'

Mr Rotkovich called Holmes on June 26, 27 and 28 but the unemployed student never got back to him or showed up at the range, which has just over 400 members.

Power: He also had a Remington 870 Marine Magnum (pictured) with him, and another glock in his car

The chilling encounter came back to Mr Rotkovich after one of his staff members recognised the man's name on Friday morning. Then other pieces of the puzzle fell into place.

'They said 'remember that guy you told us about, James Holmes? I wonder if he's the one who did the shooting?' he said.

'I
 pulled up the application and as I did the reporter was already 
standing at the apartment, which matched the address on the form in 
front of me.

'That
 was the first coincident. Then I looked at the emergency contact number
 and he had put his mother Arlene in San Diego. At that point, I knew it
 was him.

'I thought 'OK, that is who he is'. Thank God that God kept him away from us.'

The killer dyed his hair red, wore full body armor and a gas mask, carried an assault rifle, shotgun, two handguns and, after being arrested in the parking lot, told cops he was the Joker, according to police.

Holmes had been receiving packages and deliveries of weapons and ammunition for months as he planned the deadly attack.
