A top coach has claimed that British tennis players are too spoilt to succeed and unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices.

Julien Hoferlin of Belgium spoke out hours before Heather Watson tumbled out of Wimbledon in the second round, leaving Andy Murray as the sole British representative left in the tournament.

The coach trained 24-year-old Briton Dan Evans, who lost in the first round of both the singles and men’s doubles at the championships but still pocketed £31,000 in prize money.

'Bad transition': Belgian tennis coach Julien Hoferlin (right) claimed that British players are too spoilt to succeed and unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices

Mr Hoferlin said: ‘He has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices... He doesn’t understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it’s just a brief interlude in his life.’

Watson said Hoferlin ‘had a point’ and fellow Briton Naomi Broady, 24, has admitted losing her Lawn Tennis Association funding and having to pay her own way had ‘definitely made me hungrier’ to win.

Miss Broady, who was stripped of her LTA funding after she posed for a risqé photograph at the age of 17, said: ‘If I don’t win, I don’t have any money.’

Mr Hoferlin, who is due to return to Belgium, told Belgian radio station RTBF on Wednesday: ‘The transition between the juniors and the seniors seems to be very, very bad.

‘There’s not an exceptional "tennis culture" at club level and the players are too spoilt.’

Following the comments from Mr Hoferlin, Evans wrote on Twitter: 'Just like to say thanks to Julien Hoferlin for all his efforts - coaching me three times helped me a lot and most of all a true friend!'

When another Twitter user named Nadine Travis suggested that she detected 'a small amount of sarcasm' in this comment, Evans replied to her: 'Not one bit! He is one of the good ones around!'

Goran Ivanisevic, the retired Croatian player who is the only person to win the men’s singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, also expressed concerns over Britain’s poor performance this year.

He said: ‘I have always been shocked by what Britain produce. For a country like this, with the expectation, you need top 10s, top fives, world number ones.

‘You need somebody who is winning Wimbledon, attracting the crowd. Unfortunately men’s and women’s tennis has not produced.’

Following Watson’s 6-2 5-7 6-1 loss to Germany's world number seven Kerber on Centre Court yesterday, she said of Mr Hoferlin’s comments: ‘I understand where he's coming from.

'He has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices for his sport. He doesn’t understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it’s just a brief interlude in his life'

‘I see it with some players more than others. You know, we are a strong, rich federation, so I can see that people would say that whether we're doing well or not.

‘You can see that with those rich federations. I see his point. I see some players not working week-in, week-out, kind of choosing when they want to work.

‘Not just the players, but I think the coaches let them slip, let them get away with it. Nothing is said if they just don't want to play that week or don't want to give it.

‘I don't think it's all the players, I think it's the coaches too.’ Guernsey native Watson has battled back into the world's top 60 after a wretched 2013 entirely blighted by glandular fever.

The 22-year-old underlined her fighting spirit in shrugging off a sloppy 26-minute spell that handed Kerber the first set to force a decider.

Hard worker: Watson said Mr Hoferlin's comments were not fair for the likes of Katy Dunne (pictured), 19, who is the current world number 380 and British number eight

Watson admitted she has watched current British players ease through training regimes. ‘If a player wants to make it, it's all up to them,’ she said.

‘I do see where he's coming from with some players; with others, I do feel they give a lot of the hard work.

'See some players not working week-in, week-out, kind of choosing when they want to work. Not just the players, but I think the coaches let them slip, let them get away with it'

Heather Watson

‘For example, I see Katy Dunne. I did an off-season training camp with her, and every single day she worked hard and pushed. Then I've done it with others and I saw a very different story.’

Dunne, 19, is the current world number 380 and British number eight.

Ross Hutchins, back in the doubles fold after beating cancer, admitted British tennis suffers chronic underachievement, but refused to endorse Mr Hoferlin's ‘spoilt’ claim.

‘Apart from Andy (Murray), our players could be higher ranked,’ said Hutchins, who lost out to Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero in the doubles with Colin Fleming.

‘The resources and the juniors we have, we would hope to have more progression from the age of 17 to 20 and onwards.

'Shocked': Goran Ivanisevic, the retired Croatian player who is the only person to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon as a wildcard, also expressed concerns over Britain's poor performance this year

‘As of spoilt, I don't really know. 
Julien would have a pretty good estimation of that considering he was 
right in the mix of it. I think we get given a lot, I think we're 
appreciative of it.’

Mr Hoferlin is not the first Belgian to accuse British players of being spoilt.

Former
 world number one Kim Clijsters said in 2010 that British youngsters 
lacked the hunger to succeed because they were ruined with first-class 
facilities.

Goran Ivanisevic

She said: ‘We 
didn’t grow up with the facilities that you guys have. And I think maybe
 [British] kids are a little bit too spoiled too soon with what you 
have.

‘I don’t know if it’s necessary at such a young age to spoil kids or to treat them like they’re it, you know.

‘If you don’t have it, it makes you work harder to achieve it. And I think that’s where I think sometimes you have to be a little bit careful.’

Andy Murray’s mother Judy, a senior coach in the women’s game, has previously said that young British tennis players had a reputation on the international tennis circuit for being ‘lazy, ill-disciplined and lacking fight on court’.

Mrs Murray said in 2008 that many foreign coaches for junior players believed British teenagers were over-indulged by the LTA, which makes more than £30million a year profits from Wimbledon.

She said: ‘It’s often said that British juniors are lazy, ill-disciplined and lack fight on court. You always hear foreign coaches and players talking about all the money spent on British juniors.

'The resources and the juniors we have, we would hope to have more progression from the age of 17 to 20 and onwards'

Ross Hutchins

‘They say: "There are the British, so much money, no decent players." They ask about the money, and where all our players are.

‘There is definitely an element of jealousy in what the foreign coaches say, but the fact is that money can’t buy you success.’

The LTA has a £60million annual income, including £30million from Wimbledon and almost £3million from Sport England.

An LTA spokesman said: ‘In recent years we have changed the way we support our players with the introduction of a tournament bonus scheme which puts the onus on the players to earn their funding.

‘Our new Director of Player Development Bob Brett has already talked about his "no compromise" approach to high performance and he will no doubt have a big impact on the culture of our sport when he starts in September.’
