The Italian divorce fraud fooled judges at 137 county courts in England and Wales for 18 months before it was spotted 

British judges were conned into rubber-stamping 180 fake divorces masterminded by Italian fraudsters on an ‘industrial-scale’.

The scam is likely to have netted more than £500,000 for the organisers, who offered quick, cheap divorces to unhappy Italians.

Couples have to wait a minimum of three years to divorce in Italy but that can be reduced to months if they lie about their circumstances in an English court.

The Italian divorce fraud fooled judges at 137 county courts in England and Wales for 18 months before a sharp-eyed office worker spotted a flaw in papers presented to a court in Burnley.

She questioned why two Italians who had the same address in Berkshire were applying for their divorces more than 200 miles away in Lancashire.

Investigations revealed that 179 Italians who divorced in British courts had all claimed to be living at an address that turned out to be a mailbox in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

The last divorce was given to a spouse whose address was a mailbox in Epsom, Surrey.

Couples were charged £3,000 to £4,000. The divorces were finalised between August 2010 and February 2012.

But all were quashed yesterday by the leading family law judge, Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, who said it was ‘a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice on an almost industrial scale’.

In the scam, husbands and wives signed English legal forms that were filled in by the plotters with false details. 

The forms claimed they lived at the bogus addresses, and that they had been separated by mutual agreement for more than two years in accordance with English law. However, in many cases the Italians had actually been separated for much shorter periods. The divorces were valid in Italy.

Last night family lawyers said the fraud was made possible by the ease of divorce under English law, and questioned whether similar cons were being organised for couples from other countries.

The conspiracy worked because the divorce papers were spread around many courts, none of which cross-checked the addresses. Anyone in England and Wales can apply to divorce at a county court anywhere in the country.

Sir James said there was no reason to believe the Italians had ever lived in Britain, and the Maidenhead address ‘was in fact mailbox 201, one of a number of small boxes located in commercial premises’.

He added: ‘Given the dimensions of the mailbox it is clear that not even a single individual, however small, could possibly reside in it. The moving spirit of the operation was someone calling herself Dr Frederica Russo. I have no idea whether that is her real name.’

The couples paid someone called Anita Colucci, who may actually be Dr Russo, he said.

The boxes were rented by Francesco Galata, of Sarzana, north-west Italy. Police said he charged £120 an hour to ‘facilitate divorces across Europe’.

Catherine Jones, of JMW Solicitors, said: ‘The manner of divorce in England and Wales is quicker and cheaper than almost anywhere else in the world with, perhaps, the exception of the Dominican Republic or Las Vegas. In Italy, it can take more than three years and, it would appear, that might be too long for a considerable number of people.’
