Ebola is a red hot issue among medical professionals right now, so much so that doctors at one hospitals are using Tabasco sauce in their training of how to treat the deadly virus slowing dripping into U.S. territory.

At the Ebola unit at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the staff have been practicing treating fake patients who've been sprayed at random with the spicy pepper sauce, reports ABC.

Tabasco sauce is produced out of Louisiana by McIlhenny Co. from red peppers called Capsicum frutescens.

When human skin comes into contact with capsaicin, the 'spicy chemical' in the peppers, it will tingle as the brain's pain and temperature receptors are activated at the same time.

'In a way, it gives feedback immediately,' Dr Bruce Meyer, an executive vice president at the hospital, tells ABC.

The hospital's director of infection prevention, Doramarie Arocha, came up with the idea to replicate Ebola fluids with Tabasco Sauce just recently. Nurse Elizabeth Thomas told ABC that health workers were originally training with ketchup mixed with water.

Once workers in training took off their protective gear at the end of the drill, Arocha asked everyone to rub their eyes and touch their lips to determine whether or not they were free of Tabasco sauce which in a more dire circumstance could equal transmission of the deadly virus.

'But we didn't have the burning sensation,' Thomas said. 'So that's how we knew we were doing the right thing.'

After Liberian citizen Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, both contracted the deadly virus.

It's not evident as to how the nurses caught the illness but they may have been contaminated while removing their protective gear.

'When you have gone into contaminated gloves, masks or other things to remove those without risk of contaminated material touching you and being then on your clothes or face or skin and leading to an infection is critically important and not easy to do right,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference after Pham’s Ebola test came back positive.

Amber Vinson’s family said that her condition has been upgraded from fair to good earlier this week and that hopefully she is on the road to recovery.

In the wake of the recent exposures in the medical community in Texas, Governor Rick Perry promised to create two biocontainment units in Texas to treat any new transmissions of the virus.

At the moment, The United States houses four facilities with biocontainment units, each of which can treat 11 patients. Texas would be adding two new facilities, and the ability to treat several more patients.

Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29 are being treated in isolation units at the National Institutes of Health isolation facility in Bethesda, Maryland, and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

Dr Craig Spencer, 33, who returned to the U.S. six days ago from Guinea, is the first reported case of Ebola in the most populous city in America.

Spencer was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in midtown Manhattan on Thursday and is being cared for in isolation.
