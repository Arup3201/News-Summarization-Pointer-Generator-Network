Adults in Britain spend nine years of their life watching television - including three years wasted on "rubbish" programmes and repeats.

A survey of 2000 people found on average Britons now spend three-and-a-half hours of hours in front of the small screen each day.

Research by TV streaming service Blinkbox found this equates to almost 15 per cent of an adult life in the UK, estimated to be 62 years.

Time wasted: British adults spend nine years of their life watching television, three years of which is wasted on 'rubbish' programmes and repeats

This is five times longer than the 650 days which is the combined time people spend shopping, playing sport, and having sex, over their lives.

Depressingly, of the nine years spent viewing TV - 16 months is spent watching repeats and two years is wasted watching "rubbish television" by audiences own admission.

The findings state peak viewing time is over the Christmas period when the average adult will spend five and a half hours per day watching television.

Half that time will be viewing repeats but researchers say that man viewers do not mind at this time of year.

More than three quarters make a point of watching the same festive film every year - with Home Alone named the favourite.

People spend more time watching TV than doing other things like shopping

The boom in TV viewing has come at a cost - ten per cent of families say they now have every single meal while watching television.

Research by media regulator Ofcom found that pensioners are leading the rise in time spent in front of the TV.

It found the over 65's are now watching 5.8 hours of television a day, while those aged 55-64 watch 5.3 hours a day.

This compared to 4.8 and 4.4 hours in 2002, The rise in digital channels, which mean there are more options to watch, and improvements in technology have helped fuel the boom.

In its report, Ofcom said: 'Technological developments have provided more choice, greater control and better viewing experiences on the TV set.

'TV has evolved over the past decade and it has helped to retain viewers.' Around 96 per cent of UK households now have access to digital television, which means a minimum of 50 channels.

Blinkbox commissioned One Poll to investigate viewing habits. For the purposes of the survey it has classed an adult life in the UK as between 18 and 80.
