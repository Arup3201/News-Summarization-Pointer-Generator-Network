The Canadian father who was forced to choose which of his 3-year-old twin daughters to give a life-saving liver transplant to is recovering a week after surgery.

Michael Wagner's two youngest daughters Phuoc and Binh, adopted from Vietnam,  both suffer from Alagille syndrome which is slowly causing their livers to fail.

When Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne found out that both girls would need a liver transplant, they were relieved to find out that he was a perfect match. However, he was only able to give a portion of his liver to just one of his daughters, leaving him with an impossible choice. 

In the end, doctors suggested giving the donation to daughter Phuoc, since she needed it the most.

Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and it has so far been a success. 

Five days after the operation, the family posted a heartwarming video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. 

'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. 

He then moves to side of Phuoc's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in French, as the two share a tender father-daughter moment. 

Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery, as well as their continued search to find a donor for Binh. 

'So hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark: it seems like a blurr,' Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook. 'Michael still in hospital, Phuoc still on morphine, and mommy holding on on coffee. Still a fair amount of discomfort for Michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row.' 

The social media effort to find another donor has apparently been successful according to a spokesman for the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. The hospital last week received 400 submissions from people offering to be a donor for Binh and they hope to find a donor from that pool within the next few days to weeks.

In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it's been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls.

'The cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once,' he told the site Yahoo Canada.

The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity.

Gary Levy, who runs the liver donor program at the Toronto General Hospital, told The Canadian Press vial Global News that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver, which will regrow to its full size, but it can only be done once.

The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in.

Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really.

'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.'

Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision.

She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 

'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' 

Heart-wrenching choice: The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has received 400 submissions from people wanting to be donors for Binh. They hope to narrow down the list to a match for the girl in the coming days and weeks
