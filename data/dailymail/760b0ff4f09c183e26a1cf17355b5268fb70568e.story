It’s fair to say that The Lord of the Rings author J.R.R.Tolkien wasn’t thinking of holiday destinations when he dreamt up Middle-Earth as the setting for his literary masterpiece.

Nor indeed would JK Rowling ever have imagined that the fictional Diagon Alley in her Harry Potter novels might one day be considered a tourist hotspot.

But that is exactly how one artist has depicted the famous fantasy worlds.

Diagon Alley is a fictional street from Harry Potter located in London behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron

Going under the name The Green Dragon Inn, they have turned well-known locations from series including Game of Thrones into posters based on vintage 1920s-style travel adverts.

Rohan, a fictional realm of Middle-Earth in Lord of the Rings where farmers and cavalrymen live, has been transformed into a weekend destination for horse riding, while Gondor, another fantasy Kingdom from the 1950s novels, appears as a sunny coastal destination where visitors can ‘live like a king’.

Meanwhile, The Shire - the rolling land where the Hobbits live in Lord of the Rings - is shown as the ideal spot for a game of miniature golf. 

The Hogwarts Express is the name of the train that makes a run between  King's Cross Station  and Hogsmeade Station in the Harry Potter novels

Winterfell, the 8,000-year-old kingdom built by giants in George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones series, is shown as a site of ancient history, while another poster encourages more adventurous tourists to ‘venture beyond The Wall’, a reference to the ancient barrier of stone, ice and magic, hundreds of feet high and hundreds of miles long. 

In the novels, The Wall shields the Seven Kingdoms from the Northern wilderness and is manned by the Night's Watch, an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life, forgoing marriage, titles, property and children.

Hogwarts, the legendary school of wizards attended by Harry Potter, is another fictional world that has been given the artist’s treatment along with the Hogwarts Express, which is depicted as the perfect way to enjoy a view of the countryside while travelling.

Other fictional kingdoms that receive the artist’s creative interpretation are Lake Town and Rivendell, both from Lord of the Rings, and King’s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms in Game of Thrones.

The posters are being sold on Green Dragon Inn's Etsy.com page, with fantasy fans able to buy the prints for £10.

Lake-town was a small settlement and community of Men in Middle-earth, a fictional realm in The Lord of the Rings

Rivendell was an Elven outpost in Middle-Earth, the fantasy world created by J. R. R. Tolkien

Winterfell is a large castle ruled by King Robb Stark and is featured in the Game of Thrones novels

In George R.R. Martin's fantasy series, The Wall shields the Seven Kingdoms from the Northern wilderness and is manned by the Night's Watch, an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life, forgoing marriage, titles, property and children

King's Landing is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, located in the Crownlands on the east coast of Westeros
