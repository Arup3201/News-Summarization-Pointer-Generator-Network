Luca di Montezemolo has resigned as Ferrari's president, bringing an end to one of the most successful eras in the history of Formula One's most famous brands.

Di Montezemolo, 67, paid the price for a lean recent spell of success, with his position no longer tenable after last Sunday's Italian Grand Prix at which the team scored just two points.

Di Montezemolo served as assistant to Enzo Ferrari and later as president for 23 years. His departure robs the sport of another of its big beasts. 

Standing down: Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo has resigned following a lean spell of success

Bernie Ecclestone, 83, is the last full-time survivor of those larger-than-life figures who dominated the paddocks and pit lanes of the world over the last four decades.

Di Montezemolo will officially step down on October 13. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of parent company Fiat, will replace him.

Relations between Di Montezemolo and Marchionne are believed to have disintegrated in recent times as they fought over the direction of the company.

Di Montezemolo’s departure comes four days after he denied he was on his way out. Speaking at last weekend’s race at Monza, he struck a business-as-usual tone by saying he had offered his services to the Fiat board for a further three years.

But Marchionne countered Di Montezemolo’s bullish prediction, saying: ‘We are good friends but his statements... these are things I wouldn’t have said myself.’

Speaking immediately after the race, Marchionne added that Ferrari’s F1 performance was ‘unacceptable’ and winning races was ‘absolutely non-negotiable’. By then, Di Montezemolo’s departure was only a matter of days away.

In a statement released on Wednesday, Di Montezemolo said: 'This is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as Chairman after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years in addition to those spent at Enzo Ferrari’s side in the 1970s.

'My thanks, first and foremost, to the exceptional Ferrari women and men from the factory, the offices, the race tracks and the markets across the world. They were the real architects of the company’s spectacular growth, its many unforgettable victories and its transformation into one of the world’s strongest brands.

'A warm farewell and my thanks also to all of our technical and commercial partners, our dealers across the globe and, most particularly, the clients and collectors whose passion I so wholeheartedly share. 

Di Montezemolo won 18 world titles at Ferrari as team principal and president, overseeing the Michael Schumacher years of dominance at the start of the century. He brought about a 10-fold increase in revenue and tripled car sales.

But Ferrari have not won a world title since 2008 and are in the middle of their latest revamp under recently appointed team principal Matteo Mattiacci.

'Ferrari will have an important role to play within the FCA Group in the upcoming flotation on Wall Street. This will open up a new and different phase which I feel should be spearheaded by the CEO of the Group.

'This is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as president after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years in addition to those spent at Enzo Ferrari’s side in the 1970s.

'My thanks, first and foremost, to the exceptional Ferrari women and men from the factory, the offices, the race tracks and the markets across the world. They were the real architects of the company’s spectacular growth, its many unforgettable victories and its transformation into one of the world’s strongest brands.

'A warm farewell and my thanks also to all of our technical and commercial partners, our dealers across the globe and, most particularly, the clients and collectors whose passion I so wholeheartedly share.

'But my thoughts go also to our fans who have always supported us with great enthusiasm especially through the Scuderia’s most difficult moments.

'Ferrari is the most wonderful company in the world. It has been a great privilege and honour to have been its leader. I devoted all of my enthusiasm and commitment to it over the years. Together with my family, it was, and continues to be, the most important thing in my life.

'I wish the shareholders, particularly Piero Ferrari who has always been by my side, and everyone in the Company the many more years of success that Ferrari deserves.'
