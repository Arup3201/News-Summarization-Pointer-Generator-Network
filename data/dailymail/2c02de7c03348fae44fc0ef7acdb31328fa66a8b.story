Iraq has been the scene of bitter battles and bloodshed for years, but as these poignant photos show life still goes on.

This month is the tenth anniversary of the U.S led invasion of Iraq and the volatile region still remains a dangerous place to live - this morning five people were killed in a blast at a busy market.

But according to these images March 2013 is a very different landscape to March 2003 when bloodshed was daily and buildings were being bombed.

They claim to show that women who once cowered in their homes as troops marched through the heart of their country are now taking part in hairdressing competitions. 

Children who used to walk past coalition tanks in the streets are shown being able to play more freely and posters of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein no longer adorn the shop walls.

But there are also other changes 
which are not related to war and have simply progressed - modes of 
transport have been updated and as these photos show even the bumper 
cars have been updated in the last ten years.

The invasion of Iraq led by U.S. troops, in coalition with the UK and other nations, began on 20 March 2003 on 
the basis of preventing Saddam Hussein's regime from using the weapons of mass 
destruction it supposedly possessed.

But when no such weapons were found, the justification was changed to merely removing a volatile and deadly regime.

There is no official estimate of the 
number of Iraqi civilians killed as a consequence of the invasion a 
decade ago, but the death-toll is thought to be at least 100,000.

The UK lost 179 servicemen and women,
of which 136 were killed in action, before the last British troops were
withdrawn in April 2009.

In June 2009 US troops withdrew from Iraq's towns and cities, handing over security to Iraqi forces

In line with a pledge by U.S. President Barack Obama the last US combat troops left Iraq in August 2010. The last US troops left Iraq by the end of 2011.

Coalition troops may have withdrawn, but
the country remains a turbulent place to live as as Iraq's precarious sectarian balance comes under growing 
strain.

Only this morning two 
blasts at a busy cattle market in a mainly Shi'ite city in southern Iraq
killed at least five people and injured dozens more, police and medics
said.

No one claimed responsibility for the
attacks immediately, but Sunni Muslim insurgents have been redoubling 
their efforts to undermine the Shi'ite-led government and spark deeper 
intercommunal fighting since the start of the year.

Cows and calves were lying on the ground, covered in blood and dirt 
after the two car bombs were detonated simultaneously at the market in 
Diwaniya, 150 km (95 miles) south of the capital Baghdad.

"I came to buy some calves and was 
checking them when the explosion happened, I threw myself on the ground,
then the second explosion happened," Jassim Khalid, a butcher at the 
scene told Reuters.

Friday's blasts followed a series of 
explosions targeting Shi'ite neighborhoods of Baghdad late on Thursday 
in which at least 22 people were killed

Iraq is calmer than in the communal 
bloodletting of 2006-2007, but there are concerns the war in 
neighbouring Syria, where mainly Sunni rebels are fighting to oust 
President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Shi'ite Iran, is pushing Iraq back
towards sectarian strife.
