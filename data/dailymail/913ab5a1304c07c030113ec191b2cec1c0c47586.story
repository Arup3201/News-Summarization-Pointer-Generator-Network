Northern Territory policeman Garry Smith has been making people laugh on Facebook

Although he cops some flack from his mates, it's all part of the job for Northern Territory policeman Garry Smith, who has earned himself a legion of fans on social media.

Senior Sergeant Smith uses the Northern Territory Police Force Facebook page to keep the public up to date with police-related information by using humour when appropriate and signing off with his signature 'boom boom' dad jokes.

His jokes include: 'What snakes are found on police cars? Windshield vipers', and result in hundreds of likes, comments and shares.

'Some of the jokes are pretty ordinary,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia. 'But as one person commented, by entwining humour into the posts, people feel compelled to read to the end, where I infamously like to place a witty 'boom boom' joke, as a reward for their attention,' he said.

Sgt Smith said he was fine with his jokes being defined as dad humour and that Facebook was a great medium for getting important messages across to a large audience quickly.

'It's also a way to educate and connect with the public and using humour is one of the best ways to do that.' he said.

'I will not incorporate humour into a serious incident or whereby we want people to respond with accurate and timely information.

'Policing can be a tough occupation and I am trying to simply humanise the funny side of it.'

Mr Smith said his humour was inspired by unusual or quirky events, such as an officer who found a small snake earlier this month

With more than 36,000 likes on the Northern Territory Police Force page, the reaction to his jokes is overwhelmingly positive, Mr Smith said.

'A vast majority of likers on our Facebook page are very supportive of the NT police force and going off the number of likes, shares and comments we receive to some of the more funny posts, it appears most people appreciate a more light-hearted approach to what is a very serious job,' he said.

Sgt Smith said while he only applied humour when appropriate, it allowed him to humanise the work the police do.

'If I can educate people, making them realise police are only human, than I consider this an extra bonus,' he said.

Despite his popularity, Sgt Smith said he does not consider himself Facebook famous and is surprised by the reaction he gets. 'I really enjoy the opportunity to inject a bit of fun into the lighter side of our job,' he said.

'I'm certainly not after recognition. This is all about us - the NT police force and the at times, challenging job that we do.'

Yet some of the feedback has included marriage proposals and being called the funniest man in the Northern Territory.

'Garry Smith you're a champion. best way to get a message across is how you do it. Great stuff,' Scott Sims commented on one of the posts.

Sarah Bretherton wrote that she loves the 'dad jokes' at the end of the police officer's posts.

He said the notoriety was becoming coming in his everyday life.

'There is a lot of good-humoured banter thrown around between my colleagues, family and friends following some of the posts,' he said. 'I do 'cop' a bit of flack but it's all in good fun.'

Mr Smith said he had no problem with his humour being labelled as dad jokes

His fans regularly comment about how much they appreciate Mr Smith's unique form of joking

His posts have even earned him the title of the Northern Territory's funniest man by one fan

After an absence on Facebook, people were quick to welcome him back when they recognised the tone of the posts

'Most people like it and some cringe however it’s all about us - the NT Police.'

When looking for inspiration, Sgt Smith said quirky or unusual incidents were best, such a police officer who found a small snake earlier this month.

'Police are here to keep people safe and I take this as an opportunity to remind people of that and that we are human too,' he said.

'I do what I do for the goodness of our organisation. I love my job and will do anything I can to support the NT police force, whilst attempting to make a larger audience aware of our existence.

'We are a small police force covering vast distances and challenges and slowly but surely we are being noticed on a larger and national scale.'

Yet it was a serious post that hit a chord with the Facebook audience, Sgt Smith said.

'One of the more recent posts wasn't humour related, in fact it was almost tragic, however by taking a personal approach, it seems to reach more people,' he said.

'This post was in relation to a crash between a sedan and a truck on 31 July, which could easily have claimed the life of two small children, if it weren’t for the parents correctly fitting two safety capsules.'

As always, Sgt Smith had a joke for Daily Mail Australia.

'And finally – what does a cat like to eat on a hot summer's day? A mice cream cone – Boom boom.'
