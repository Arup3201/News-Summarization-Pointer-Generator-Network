PR guru Matthew Freud was caught speeding on a motorway at 117mph in a Ferrari - while his five-year-old son slept in the front seat.

Wealthy Freud, head of the international PR firm Freud Communications, was caught by police racing home along the M5 in Devon.

He was today banned from the roads for six months and fined almost £1,000 at Exeter Magistrates Court, for the 'exceptionally high speed'.

Banned: PR guru Matthew Freud, pictured leaving court today, was banned from the roads for six month after being caught speeding at 117mph in a Ferrari

Freud, who is married to Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, was speeding home from a business trip in Cornwall when he was pulled over by a police officer.

The court heard Freud, 48, of North West London, had borrowed the black Ferrari 458 Spider from a business associate and was not used to its power.

The £200,000 supercar has a maximum speed of 199mph and can go from 0 to 62mph in just 3.4 seconds.

The JPs told Freud at court: 'This was an exceptionally high speed especially with a small child in the car.'

Prosecutor David Barnes told the court 
that a speed detection device recorded the speed at 117mph on the 70mph 
M5 at Sampford Peverell on July 31, 2012.

Mr Barnes said the police stopped the Ferrari and Freud said the vehicle belonged to his business partner.

He said: 'It appeared the defendant was 
in the company of his five year old son who was asleep in the front seat
of the vehicle.'

He said the weather was fine and dry that evening and traffic was moderate.

Freud’s lawyer Martin Bourne told the court that his client already had nine points on his licence in the last three years - two fixed penalties for speeding and for for using a mobile phone while driving.

He said: 'He was driving back to his London home. He had been in Cornwall during the day for a business meeting. It was the school holidays and that is why his young son was with him. He was caring for his son as he went about his business.'

He said he had borrowed the car and was not used to it or its speed when he put his foot on the accelerator and ‘did not keep an eye on the speed’.

'He apologises for the offence. He accepts that it was a grossly excessive speed.'

Freud is married to businesswoman Elisabeth Murdoch - daughter of Rupert Murdoch.

Mr Bourne told the court four of Freud's six children attend school in three different counties and his wife works away a great deal and Freud does much of the driving for his family.

He added: 'He is not someone who habitually speeds.'

The court heard Freud would not suffer exceptional hardship by a ban and his means were ‘substantial’ to pay a fine.

Mr Bourne said: 'He is a resourceful man who can manage his life. He is chairman of a company he founded 28 years ago.'

Freud admitted speeding and the magistrates put six points on his licence making a total of 15.

He was banned from driving for six months and ordered to pay a total of £905 in fines and costs.

The court warned him not to drive before the end of his ban as by doing so he would be committing an ‘extremely serious offence’.

Freud paid by card before being driven away from court in a black Mercedes.

Freud is the great grandson of Sigmund Freud and the son of the late MP and broadcaster Clement.

His first wife was Caroline Hutton, with whom he had two children. She went on to marry Earl Spencer, the brother of Princess Diana.

He and Elisabeth Murdoch also have two children, and she has two from a previous relationship.

He heads Freud Communications, which he founded, and employs about 200 people.

Its list of clients includes big name brands such as Sky, Asda, Universal and Walkers.

The company also enjoyed a 30% increase in profits this year after winning a London 2012 contract.

It was the lead PR agency for ticketing, volunteering and the torch relay programme.

He set up his first firm at 16 and founded his own PR agency aged 21.
