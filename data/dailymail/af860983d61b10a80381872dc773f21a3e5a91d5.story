A Muslim woman who was turned down for a job by Abercrombie & Fitch after she showed up for an interview wearing a black headscarf is having her employment discrimination claim considered by the Supreme Court.

Samantha Elauf was 17 when she interviewed for a 'model' position, as the company calls its sales staff, at an Abercrombie Kids store in a shopping mall in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2008.

She never explicitly voiced her religious views or her need to wear a headscarf but the assistant store manager correctly assumed she was a Muslim.

She impressed the assistant store manager, who then consulted a manager and explained that she thought Elauf wore the scarf for religious reasons - but the manager said the headscarf wasn't permitted even if it was worn because of Elauf's religion, according to the suit.

The headscarf, or hijab, conflicted with the company's Look Policy, a code derived from Abercrombie's focus on what it calls East Coast collegiate or preppy style.

Abercrombie has said it didn't violate the law because it never got 'direct, explicit notice' from Elauf that her practice conflicted with the company's policy. 

At the time of the interview, the policy required employees to dress in a way that's consistent with the clothing Abercrombie sells, and it prohibited wearing headscarves or anything in black.

The company has said it changed its headscarf policy as early as 2010, but the ban on black clothing remains. 

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit on Elauf's behalf, and a jury eventually awarded her $20,000.

But the federal appeals court in Denver threw out the award and concluded that Abercrombie & Fitch could not be held liable because Elauf never asked the company to relax its policy against headscarves.

Fighting back: The company said Elauf never asked them to relax its policy in line with her religious practice

'[A]n applicant or employee cannot remain silent before the employer regarding the religious nature of his or her conflicting practice and need for an accommodation and still hope to prevail in a religion-accommodation case,' Abercrombie wrote in a brief. 

'Abercrombie expends a great deal of effort to ensure that its target customers receive a holistically brand-based, sensory experience. To Abercrombie, a Model who violates the Look Policy by wearing inconsistent clothing inaccurately represents the brand, causes consumer confusion, fails to perform an essential function of the position, and ultimately damages the brand.'

Elauf now works for Urban Outfitters and also runs a fashion blog. 

The case being argued Wednesday explores when an employer must take steps to accommodate the religious beliefs of a worker or job applicant. 

Organizations of state and local governments are supporting the company out of concerns that, if the EEOC prevails, they would be subject to more discrimination claims as large employers.

Muslim, Christian and Jewish advocacy organizations have weighed in on Elauf's side, as have gay-rights groups.

A legal brief on behalf of Orthodox Jews argues that requiring job applicants to voice the need for religion-related special treatment makes them less likely to be hired, with no reason given for the decision.

Orthodox Jews who wear a skullcap, or yarmulke, or who may not work on Saturdays are routinely advised to withhold that information until after they are hired, lawyer Nathan Lewin said in his Supreme Court filing.
