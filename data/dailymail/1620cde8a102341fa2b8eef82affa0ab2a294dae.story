Increasing use of the contraceptive pill is being linked with the rise of prostate cancer in men.

Researchers say the Pill has soared in popularity over the past 40 years, and at the same time prostate cancer has become the most common form of the disease in men.

There is a statistical relationship between the two trends, possibly driven by men’s greater exposure to the oestrogen hormone contained in the Pill.

Long-term effects: Regions where use of the Pill is commonplace have higher incidents of prostate cancer,  a study has found

Widespread use of the Pill has led to 
more of the hormone finding its way into the water supply and food 
chain, with implications for human health, says a study in BMJ Open.

Using data from 87 countries, 
researchers found that where the proportion of women using the 
contraceptive pill is higher, rates of prostate cancer are higher.

Other contraceptives such as 
intrauterine devices or condoms were not linked to a higher incidence of
prostate cancer. A team of researchers from Canada used two sets of 
data to pinpoint rates of prostate cancer and associated deaths and the 
proportion of women using common methods of contraception for 2007.

Use of the contraceptive pill was 
significantly associated with the number of new cases of prostate cancer
around the world, in findings which were not affected by a nation’s 
wealth and therefore probably not influenced by better detection through
screening and health services.

The research is speculative and 
definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, said research leader Dr David 
Margel, of the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto University.

But excess exposure to oestrogen is 
known to cause cancer and the study suggests that widespread use of the 
Pill has resulted in by-products called endocrine disruptors being 
deposited in the environment.

These do not break down easily in the 
body so can be passed into urine and end up in the water supply or the 
food chain, thus exposing the general population.

Dr Kate Holmes, of The Prostate Cancer
Charity, said: ‘This study does not present a strong evidence case for 
an association between the use of the contraceptive pill and prostate 
cancer, nor does it intend to.

‘It is intended to explore the 
possibility that release of endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) into 
the environment, a process which is not unique to the Pill, might impact
on the incidence of the disease.

‘However, for all of the 87 countries 
in the study, there is no information on the level of these chemicals in
the environment, with the focus on the contraceptive pill as the sole 
source, which we know is not the case.’

Excess exposure linked to cancer, and it is thought that widespread use of the Pill may have led to more oestrogen entering water supply and food chain
