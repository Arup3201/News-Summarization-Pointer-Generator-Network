Gary Lester, 53, denies sexually assaulting two women. He is accused of kissing and groping them after being booked for a massage

A masseur groped two women clients and rubbed their breasts, a court heard today.

Gary Lester, 53, is accused of sexually assaulting the two women and allegedly told one: 'Don't get carried away.'

He also told them they had 'great bums', St Albans Crown Court was told.

The court heard the masseur ran his hands up the thighs of one of the customers and remarked: 'I am more up than down', which was said to refer to him having an erection.'

Lester, of Kensworth, near Dunstable, Bedfordshire, pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting one woman on September 19, 2010, and one of sexually assaulting another woman on June 1, 2011.

The first woman, from Hertfordshire, said Lester massaged her breasts and kissed her during the the third massage she had with him.

She said he had been recommended to her.

She said she was wearing only knickers with a towel to cover her during the appointment in September, 2010, and had lit candles, put out aroma therapy oil and dimmed the 
lights.

She said he told her he was booked to massage at a swinger's party the following weekend.

She told the court: 'He
was working on my legs and came up to do my bottom. He was a bit longer
than I expected. He said: "I'm taking too long massaging your bum. You 
have got a really nice bum.'''

The
woman, who said she had more than 100 massages in the past, said she 
felt uncomfortable when he ran his hands up from her hip to the side of 
her body and allegedly asked: 'Do you want a sensual massage?'

She told the court she declined but allowed him to massage her breasts, which she thought was part of a normal massage.

When she told him she did not feel comfortable he stopped.

At
the end of the massage she said he kissed her on the forehead.

'I said: "Did you just kiss me?" He didn't say anything and he just kissed me 
again in the same place,' she said.

During the previous massage, in September, 2010, she said Lester touched the rim of her knickers and touched her in a 'more sensual' way than during their first appointment.

She said he told her 'You have lovely skin' and said he did not have much of a sex life with his  girlfriend.

On that occasion the woman said he massaged her breasts, but did so in way that she did not think was sexual.

She told the court she did not want Lester to do anything sexual and was not interested in anything but a massage.

The woman complained to police in June 2011 after she heard that a woman in Bedfordshire had made an allegation against Lester.

One of the alleged victims told St Albans Crown Court that Lester told her he was good at oral sex, that she had 'great boobs' and kissed her face

Prosecutor George Heimler said: 'He is a professional masseur. He took advantage of his 
position to test the boundaries with the two complainants to see if they
want to provide sexual favours, to see if he could obtain some form of 
sexual gratification.

'He kissed the first victim twice. It was unsought, undesired and unwanted.'

The Bedfordshire woman went for a back massage on March 9, 2011.

She went back again on June 1 when it was alleged Lester made sexual remarks.

Mr Heimler said: 'He told her if she wanted any sexual or 
sensual touching all she needed to do was to cough.

'There
was some sexually explorative language to see how far he could go. He 
kissed her on the chin and said: "Nearly". He missed her lips. He 
touched her thigh near the knicker line. She told him in no uncertain 
terms to desist.'

Mr 
Heimler alleged Lester told her he was good at oral sex and lifted up 
his shirt to show her a tattoo.

'He told her she had a "great bum" and "great boobs"', he said.

In a
sexual reference as he massaged her he allegedly said: 'I am more up 
than down.'

'This was a sexual reference referring to an erection', the prosecutor said.

The woman went home distressed, the court was told, and the police were called two days later after she told her mother.

Mr Heimler said: 'It is clear they did not consent to what he was doing.'

When
Lester was questioned by the police he said all the contact was fully 
consensual and he behaved professionally throughout.

He said the 
Bedfordshire woman had been 'flirting like crazy' and was coming onto 
him sexually. He said the Hertfordshire woman was the one who spoke 
about sex and swingers parties.

The trial continues.
