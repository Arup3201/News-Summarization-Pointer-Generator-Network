A small bronze sculpture that was dismissed as a 'humble' paperweight for decades has been confirmed as an £80,000 Barbara Hepworth.

The 1965 work, called Oval Form, sat on the headteacher's desk at St Ives School for years and was originally used as a house prize when students performed well.

But was revealed as 'probably the most expensive paperweight in the world' by stunned experts on BBC's Antiques Roadshow on Sunday.

The £80,000 sculpture Oval Form, pictured, was originally used as a prize for academic achievement before it became one of the world's most expensive paperweights

David Harris, St Ives School head, said the paperweight would not leave the school in Cornwall, despite its value.

He said: 'It's sitting on my desk so it's probably the most expensive paperweight in the world.

Dame Barbara Hepworth, pictured, was a governor at St Ives School in Cornwall and gave the sculpture as a gift. She died in 1975

'We have links to the art scene because we live and work in St Ives so we knew it was valuable but we'd not had it valued. We didn't know it was that valuable.

'Not that it is of any consequence because it's the school's and it will remain the school's. It's a fabulous piece of work and it's something which we do treasure.'

Mr Harris said Oval Form was given to the school by the artist - who used to be a governor there - many years ago as a gift.

It was used as a prize for the house that achieved the most academic merits each term.

St Ives School librarian Jan Wardman took the 'paperweight' to show experts on the popular BBC show in Falmouth and beamed as she was told the news.

Visibly excited Rupert Maas, an expert in ceramics and glass, told the show: 'It's by Barbara Hepworth.

'This is English Modernism, you know, you cannot confuse it with anything else.

'It is very tactile and made of bronze. It's worth £60,000 to £80,000. And it's a very important thing. It's a seriously exciting find.

'There's a lovely sense to it and turning it around is quite fun because it looks completely different from all angles.

'It's easy to forget that here in Cornwall we're actually at the cutting edge of Modernism really. Barbara Hepworth was really at the forefront of British Modernism.'

Tourists flock to St Ives to see Barbara Hepworth's large bronze Modernist sculptures in the Hepworth Memorial Garden.

Another sculpture sits outside the 
Guildhall, home to St Ives Town Council but this smaller example of her 
work is not widely known.

TV antiques expert Rupert Maas, pictured, described the piece as a 'seriously exciting find' and said it was worth up to £80,000

The staggering valuation of the bronze was a surprise to the school, who expected it to be worth considerably less.

Mr Harris added: 'It's not something we let out of our sight now.

'The guy on Antiques Roadshow said it will be in the upper reaches because it's such a beautiful domestic piece.

'For them it was a significant find. It did look lovely on the television with the light catching it. It is beautiful and a very tactile piece.'

The school is now considering creating imitations of the original to hand out as school prizes.

Oval Form is in good company at the school, which has two Leonard Fuller paintings and a Hyman Segal sculpture.
