A professional beggar who makes £50,000 a year is facing jail after allegedly breaching an Asbo which banned him from scrounging on the streets.

Simon Wright was allegedly spotted begging in London’s Leicester Square, weeks after magistrates ordered him to stop operating in the capital.

The ‘audacious’ freeloader was arrested and bailed – only to start begging again just a few hundred yards away, it is claimed.

Simon Wright, who was banned from begging in the capital after reports he earned £50,000 a year, has been arrested again by police

The 37-year-old has an order which remains in place until 2015

Westminster city council street wardens spotted Wright in Leicester Square on Tuesday and alerted police

Wright was arrested and bailed to appear at Westminster magistrates' court later this month

Last month the Daily Mail reported how the 37-year-old would sit in ragged clothes on the pavement of Putney High Street in South London, with a handwritten sign claiming he was ‘homeless and hungry’.

In fact he would return each night to a £300,000 council flat in nearby Fulham.

As a result, magistrates issued an Asbo which banned him from begging anywhere in London for two years.

But Westminster city council street wardens allegedly spotted him asking for money in Leicester Square on Tuesday, and alerted police.After officers realised who he was, he was arrested and bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later this month.

But just half an hour later, Wright was allegedly seen begging in nearby Coventry Street.

He moved off before police arrived.

Councillor Nickie Aiken, Westminster’s spokesman for community protection, said: ‘It is his sheer audacity that anyone would find so galling.

'This is why we have our team of street wardens.

‘A lot of people handing him money won’t be earning anywhere near the £75,000 you would need to make [£50,000] before tax.

‘Wright is not an isolated case, there are plenty more beggars like him, all looking equally pitiful. So, once again, we urge people not to pay money to people on the streets.

‘Even those who are genuine cases should not be encouraged to do so. Our teams will go out and offer help to anyone in real need.’

Wright has already escaped being jailed for breaching one condition of his Asbo, after he was caught with his dog unmuzzled.

At the original hearing in May, Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court heard that Wright regularly went into betting shops and amusement arcades to change his coins for notes.

On many occasions they added up to between £200 and £300.

Police constable Oliver Strebel, who brought the case to court, said: ‘He worked pretty much every day, and had done so for about three years. He certainly put in the hours.’

Wright is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on July 25, charged with breaching his Asbo.

If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to five years.
