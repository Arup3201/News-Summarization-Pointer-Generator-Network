North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is looking increasingly likely to visit Russia in his first trip abroad since taking power three years ago, giving the world an unprecedented chance to see him at work on the international stage.

Moscow has invited many world leaders - including Kim and the presidents of China and South Korea - to celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, which will include a massive parade on Red Square.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said last month the Kremlin had received the 'first signals from Pyongyang' that the North Korean leader is planning to attend the May 9 festivities. 

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could visit Russia on May 9 for the 70th anniversary celebration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, which will include a massive parade on Red Square 

South Korean media quoted anonymous sources in Beijing this week as saying that Kim is likely to accept.

U.S. President Barack Obama has reportedly decided to stay home, so that awkwardness has apparently been averted.

North Korea has not officially commented on the invitation and still has ample time to decline it.

But choosing Moscow for his first overseas trip would be a strong indication of the direction Kim wants to take his country.

It would also provide the outside world with a rare look at a man who, while revered at the centre of an intense cult of personality at home, is one of the biggest mysteries in international politics.

If he attends it will be Kim's first trip abroad since taking power three years ago, and will be the world's first chance to see the dictator work on an international stage 

The leader would be following in the footsteps of his father Kim Jong-Il, who is pictured here shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his 2002 trip to Vladivostok
