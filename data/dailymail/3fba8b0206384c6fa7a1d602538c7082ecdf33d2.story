In a shot eerily similar to a scene from the blockbuster film Independence Day, an unidentified flying object hovers over the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest.

The man who took the photograph of the flying saucer in Romania's capital has spoken of his shock at his brief encounter.

Cosmin Garlesteanu described getting a strange feeling while taking a picture of the imposing government building, and was stunned when he looked back at his snap to see a strange green and blue light beaming down on it.

Strange sighting: A photographer captured this UFO hovering above the Romanian parliament in Bucharest

Inside the beam there appears to be two elliptical shapes hovering above the grand structure.

The image mirrors a famous scene from Hollywood's Independence Day,  starring Will Smith, where a spaceship appears above the White House in Washington and blows it up.

The photograph, taken on February 4, has attracted global interest after Mr Garlesteanu uploaded it onto a photo-sharing website.

Viewers around the world have been coming up with a host of theories about what the unusual sight could be.

Some are convinced it is an alien spacecraft, while others dismiss it as a simple trick of the light.

The amateur photographer said: 'I was walking after work and decided to take some photos. It was a very cold and windy and there was a cloudy sky.

'It was the first time I've taken pictures of the Houses of Parliament at night and I was not dissapointed by the result.

'I took five or six pictures but when I took the last one I got a strange feeling. I looked again and again and couldn't believe my eyes. I didn't know what the strange light was.

'I saw it when I viewed my picture. I can't explain it. I showed the picture to my friend and he said it looked like a scene from Independence Day. It was very unexpected.

'It's a strange light with a form I can't really describe, it looks like a UFO. I always think miracles can happen.'

Mr Garlesteanu's spot follows a spate UFO sightings over Bucharest. In January, a triangle UFO formation of three unexplained lights in the sky above the city were captured on video.

Also last month, another person reported sighting a large black disc, believed to have a four miles diameter, with multiple lights above Bucharest.

The spotter describes seeing the UFO at 2.30am with a group of friends, which 'sat still for four minutes with lights on'.

They describe seeing more lights turning on 'rapidly in a sequence and after few seconds it just went up, turning the whole disc and disappeared in a fraction of a second to the east side of the city'.
