The gunman who killed one student and wounded two others at a small 
Seattle college last week had stopped taking his medications because he 'wanted to feel the hate', and he detailed his plans in a handwritten 
journal for two weeks before the attack, a prosecutor said Tuesday.

'I just want people to die, and I'm gonna die with them!' Aaron 
Ybarra wrote the day of the shooting, King County Prosecutor Dan 
Satterberg said.

Satterberg released new details of the allegations as he filed 
charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and assault against 
Ybarra, 26. Satterberg is seeking an exceptional sentence of life in 
prison.

Authorities say Ybarra has been held on suicide watch without bail at
 the county jail since a student pepper-sprayed the gunman and ended the
 rampage Thursday at Seattle Pacific University.

Charged: Aaron Ybarra, 26, is being charged with multiple felonies in last week's shooting that left one person dead and two wounded at Seattle Pacific University, King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg said Tuesday

Ybarra typically would face 69 to 86 years in prison if convicted of the charges facing him, but prosecutors will argue that an aggravating factor -- a 'destructive and foreseeable impact on persons beyond the victims' -- allows for a life sentence

Ybarra's lawyer, Ramona Brandes, has said her client has a long 
history of mental issues but is aware of the trauma caused by the 
shooting and is sorry. She did not immediately return a message seeking 
comment Tuesday.

The journal, recovered by police from Ybarra's truck, parked near the
 shooting, reflects Ybarra's admiration for the school shooters at 
Virginia Tech and Columbine High School but does not clearly explain why
 he targeted the Seattle college, Satterberg said.

Ybarra considered other universities — Washington State, Eastern 
Washington and Central Washington were mentioned — but apparently 
dismissed them because they were too far away, the prosecutor said.

Instead, weeks before the shooting, Ybarra took a tour of Seattle 
Pacific, a private Christian college in a leafy neighborhood north of 
downtown. He remarked on how friendly and helpful the academic counselor
 and students were who showed him around, Satterberg said.

During the tour, Ybarra learned the academic year would soon end, solidifying his plans, Satterberg said.

Ybarra shot Paul Lee, 19, in the back of the head with a 
double-barreled shotgun outside Otto Miller Hall after Lee turned to run
 away, according to the charging documents. Some of the birdshot pellets
 struck another student, Thomas Fowler, standing several feet away.

He tried to shoot a woman nearby, but the gun misfired and she escaped, a detective's probable cause statement said.

Ybarra then entered the building, encountering a man seated at a 
table, the statement said. Ybarra ordered the man not to disrespect him,
 but did not shoot, the detective wrote — instead turning the gun on 
student Sarah Williams, who was coming down some stairs.

Williams was wounded and remains hospitalized in satisfactory condition.

Because one of the barrels of the gun had misfired, Ybarra essentially had a single-shot weapon, Satterberg said.

As Ybarra tried to reload, Jon Meis, a student building monitor, 
rushed out of his office, pepper-sprayed the gunman, grabbed the weapon 
and hid it in his office, the prosecutor said. Meis came back and helped
 another student hold the gunman down until police arrived.

Ybarra fired just two shots but carried nearly 50 shells and had 25 
more in his truck, because he planned to kill many more people, 
Satterberg said. He also had a large hunting knife and planned to slit 
his own throat, the detective's statement said.

'Hero': Jon Meis, 26, is being credited with 
stopping the would-be murderous rampage by tackling the gunman as he 
stopped to re-load. Meis is seen here with his fiancee Kaylie Sparks, 
whom he will marry June 21

'In the defendant's plan to murder innocent students, he did not 
anticipate the courage of Jon Meis,' Satterberg said. 'Mr. Meis, though a
 reluctant and humble figure in this tragedy, undoubtedly saved many 
lives. He emerges from this awful crime as an example of how we all 
would hope we would act to confront a killer.'

Ybarra gave an hourlong police interview after his arrest, saying he 
didn't specifically target any of the students but had a 'hatred for the
 world in general', the probable cause statement said.

He told 
detectives he had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and 
transient psychosis but had stopped taking his medicine about six months
 earlier because he wanted to feel his hate, it said.

The standard sentencing range for the charges is 69 to 86 years in 
prison, but Satterberg said he is seeking an exceptional sentence under a
 rarely used aggravating factor: that the crime had a 'destructive and 
foreseeable impact on persons other than the victim.'

Speaking to KING5, Ybarra's friend Jason Wells described the 26-year-old as a 'good kid' who was 'dislodged from reality,' at least in part due to his alcohol problem.

'He would say, "I’m going to kill everyone,"' Wells said. 'I never took him seriously.'

The Seattle Times reported that Ybarra had a fascination with mass shootings, particularly with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.

Classmate Briana Clarke told the Seattle Times that Meis, who was on duty as a hall monitor, sprayed the attacker in the face, grabbed him around the neck and then wrestled him to the ground.

'There were a lot of shells on the ground..it looked like he was planning to go the distance and Jon stopped him,' another student told KOMO-TV.

Several other students then piled on the attacker and held him until police arrived.

'But for the great response for the people at Seattle Pacific this incident would have been much more tragic,' assistant police chief Paul McDonagh said Thursday night.

One of Meis' roommates, Ryan Salgado, told The Seattle Times he seemed to be in shock afterward. A spokeswoman at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center said Friday Meis wasn't injured, but was suffering from mental anguish and was treated and released Thursday.

Ybarra, 26, says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness. According to reports, he still lives with his parents in a Seattle suburb

Paul Lee was shot in the head and died at a nearby hospital. Sarah Williams was struck in the neck and remains in critical condition.

Two other students, Thomas Fowler and another man in his 20s, were wounded but are in stable condition after sustaining minor injuries.

Lee hailed from Portland, Oregon, and was a graduate of Westview High School.

The 19-year-old’s grieving friends took to Twitter to express their disbelief at his violent and untimely death.

'Paul Lee. I can't even believe you're gone. Ante up, math class, and just seeing you around campus and dancing with you brightened my life immeasurably. I am blessed and honored to have known you. You will live on through all of us and I expect you to teach us your dance from heaven at 6pm tonight,’ Sarrah Rasmussen commented on Instagram.

The college freshman was universally described as a positive person who always wore a smile on his face. His favorite pastime was dancing, and he belonged to several hip hop dance clubs in Portland and Seattle.

'Paul Lee was a ray of light in my classroom for three years,' Westview Japanese teacher Brian Bangerter said in a statement. 'It was impossible be around him and not feel happy. Everyone who knew him felt close to him.  He will always be remembered for his infectious positive attitude.  I know I will never forget him.'

The gunman has been identified as Aaron Ybarra. Authorities say he is not a student and has no connection to Seattle Pacific University or to any of his victims. Detectives are still trying to determine why he targeted the college.

KING-TV reported that Ybarra lives with his parents in the Seattle area. He has reportedly confessed to the shootings and even bragged about the carnage he inflicted on the campus. Authorities say he did not expect to survive the rampage.

His Facebook page says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness and attended Edmonds Community College prior to 2012.

In the panic, police believed there was a second shooter and searched for up to an hour, possibly delaying medical attention for the wounded, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports.

Witnesses said the gunman barged into Otto Miller Hall - the science and engineering building for the university - about 3.30pm on Thursday.

One witness told KIRO-TV that the gunman held his weapon on three students and told them not to move, when they did, he shot and wounded two and shot another student in the face.

The victim who was shot in the face was rushed to the hospital, where he died.

'The shooter began to reload his shotgun and a student that is the building monitor inside the hall confronted the shooter, was able to subdued the individual, and once on the ground, other students jumped on top of him and were able to pin the shooter to the ground until police arrived,' Seattle Police Captain Chris Fowler said in a press conference.

Seattle Pacific is a small Christian college associated with the Free Methodist Church with a student body just of about 4,370.
