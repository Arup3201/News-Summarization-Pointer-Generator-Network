This is Britain’s oldest surviving floating warship - where three men responsible for its maintenance must work round the clock to keep it pristine.

The workers face a never-ending task involving scaling the heights of HMS Trincomalee’s mast which overlooks Hartlepool in County Durham.

They give the ship its constant deep clean and fulfil painting duties which include sanding back the ship’s wheel and painting the cannons on deck.

The impressive warship was built in Bombay, India, in 1817 for the Royal Navy shortly after the Napoleonic Wars.

The ship - named after the 1782 Battle of Trincomalee - was transferred from Portsmouth to Hartlepool where she has remained for the last 27 years.

HMS Trincomalee is now listed as part of the National Historic Fleet and is maintained by the HMS Trincomalee Trust, a registered charity.

David McKnight, 52, general manager of the trust, said it takes 20 gallons of paint to touch up the boat every few years.

Mr McKnight, of Bedale, North Yorkshire, said: ‘We have three full-time men working on the maintenance of the ship. 

Far from light work: The ship was one of the most restored in the world, and the trust said 'we need to keep it that way'

Sanding the wheel: Keeping the rain water from the inside of the boat is a big problem for employees

Special: The Trincomalee, docked in Hartlepool, County Durham, holds the distinction of being the oldest British warship still afloat

Cannon balls: Three men responsible for the ship's maintenance must work round the clock to keep it pristine

Lick of paint: The trust said that rain water is 'the enemy, whereas salt water is our friend as it helps to maintain the timbers'

Round the clock work: There are 'stacks of jobs for the three men to do', the trust said - adding that 'sheer hard work' is required

Mast: David McKnight from the trust said he 'couldn’t imagine any other comparable job, it is such a rare job to have'

Having a blast: The Trincomalee is 52 years younger than HMS Victory - but that is in dry dock in Portsmouth

‘The ship was one of the most restored in the world - it was very well restored so we need to keep it that way.

‘She is the only warship left of her type so it is important to keep her fully maintained.

‘There are stacks of jobs for the three men to do, it is sheer hard work. 

'Keeping the rain water from the inside of the boat is a big problem.

‘Rain water is the enemy whereas salt water is our friend as it helps to maintain the timbers. 

'I couldn’t imagine any other comparable job - it is such a rare job to have.’

The Trincomalee holds the proud title of being the oldest British warship still afloat.

This is because Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory, despite being 52 years her senior, is in dry dock in Portsmouth.

HMS Trincomalee, a 38-gun frigate, was launched in October 1817 in Bombay, India, following her construction - which cost £23,000.

After being fitted with temporary masts and rigging, and picking up guns and ammunition on the way to Britain, she arrived in Portsmouth in 1819.

During her first commission, the 1,447-ton ship provided hurricane relief in Bermuda in 1847, as well as preventing an invasion of Cuba.

Long history: Following a restoration HMS Trincomalee has become the centrepiece of Hartlepool Historic Dockyard in County Durham

After returning to Britain and being refitted, she headed for Vancouver in 1852 under the command of Captain Wallace Houstoun.

From there she patrolled the west coast of North America and the Pacific Ocean.

Her role over the next few decades involved being a training vessel in various ports in Britain including Hartlepool and Southampton.

She was then renamed TS Foudroyant in 1903 in honour of an earlier ship that was wrecked. 

She remained in service until 1986 - including as a storage and training vessel in the Second World War - and was renamed Trincomalee in 1992. 

The ship spent most of her 20th century life in Gosport, Hampshire - and was afloat for all of that time.

But she was brought up to Hartlepool in 1987 by a heavy-lift barge for restoration, and is unlikely to go out to sea again now because of her value.

Following the restoration she has become the centrepiece of Hartlepool Historic Dockyard, and the managing trust says she is in very good condition.
