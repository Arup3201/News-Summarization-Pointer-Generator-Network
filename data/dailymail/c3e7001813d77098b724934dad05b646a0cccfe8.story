A hand-built animal shelter has been left ransacked after vandals broke in, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage and releasing vulnerable animals into the wild.

The break-in is believed to have taken place on Monday night at the Blyth Wildlife Rescue site near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, used to house creatures before they are let back into the wild in spring.

The huge damage inflicted on the sheds, cabins and aviaries has led John Anderson - who founded the charity in 2006 to support injured birds and small mammals - to warn its future is now in doubt.

The facility houses hedgehogs, pigeons, an eider duck, sparrow hawk and barn owls. All have been accounted for except for one sparrow hawk and two barn owls, as well as several pigeons.

Mr Anderson, 26, told MailOnline: ‘The place has been smashed to pieces, things poured onto the ground. They’ve had to go out of their way and trespassed on a substantial size of land to get here.

‘We all have property and things that are important to us, but this site is something I've spent so much time on. Everything that has been damaged has been built with our own hands.

'It's been smashed to pieces for absolutely no reason. All of a sudden it's gone. It's not just the actual value of items that have been stolen - it's the cost of time and funds needed to repair them.’

He added: ‘I knew something was wrong when I couldn’t open the gate on Tuesday afternoon. After being let in by the landowner we found a scene of absolute chaos. It was a stab to the heart.

‘It was like the Tasmanian Devil had been there or an earthquake had hit - everything you could imagine. All the doors were open, things were smashed up in the buildings.

‘Cages [had been] thrown around, mesh kicked in, medication and food poured everywhere. It was complete devastation. It had been ransacked.’

The site, which is kept hidden from the public by a 9ft fence and razor wire, is thought to have been entered by offenders scaling the gate. They went on to steal a generator and power tools.

Mr Anderson said: ‘Fortunately we have secured the majority of our patients and these animals have been moved away into secure accommodation.

‘We are keeping our fingers crossed for those who left as they really weren’t ready to be released and we looked after them for so long.

‘But as you can imagine, everything is very much up in the air when it comes to the long-term prospects of the charity. It took us a long time to get here and this was more than a burglary.

‘It was not just damaged sheds as they were built by hand for a specific purpose by volunteers to help animals in need. These people were not just there to steal.’

Local residents have already begun coming forward with donations and offers of manpower to help the charity get back on track.

Mr Anderson added: ‘Thanks to everyone for their words of support and donations. Please don’t be offended if we don’t return your calls or messages at this time.

‘Our main priority is to look after the needs of our current patients, secure funding via donations with your help and look at options for the future.

‘Given the circumstances, we are very limited in what we can do to help sick and injured wildlife at the moment, and cannot accept any new admissions.’ 

A Northumbria Police spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The burglary was reported at 3.38pm on Tuesday. It's believed the burglary happened at any time overnight from 6pm on Monday and 3pm on Tuesday.

‘A number of sheds and outbuildings were broken into, causing hundreds of pounds worth of damage, and a red Honda generator was stolen. Also, a grey Stihl strimmer was stolen.

‘Any witnesses with any information should contact police on 101, extension 69191, and quote our reference number 624 30/12/2014.’

The charity’s mascot, Bonnie the Barn Owl, was not housed at the vandalised site, which is located to the north west of Newcastle. For more information about the charity, click here.
