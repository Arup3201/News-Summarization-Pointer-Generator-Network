Rangers striker Nicky Clark insists he will react in the right way after losing his place to Kenny Miller.

Despite being the Ibrox side's most consistent performer over the last two months, the former Queen of the South hitman was dropped for Saturday's 6-1 win over Raith Rovers.

He was back in Ally McCoist's line-up for the straightforward 2-0 win over East Fife at New Bay View in Tuesday night's Petrofac Training Cup quarter-final.

But he can expect to find himself back on the bench for next Saturday's Scottish Championship clash at Dumbarton, with Miller now fully recovered from the calf tear which kept him out of action for six weeks.

However, Clark insists he is not the type to go in a huff.

He said: 'I'm up for the challenge. You need to be if you are playing for a club like Rangers.

'All the boys are doing well and scoring goals, so I just need to keep my head down, keep working hard and when my chance comes, make sure I take it.

Kenny Miller replaced Clark against Raith and scored in the comprehensive 6-1 win

'I was a wee bit disappointed not to start at the weekend but any player will feel the same when you are doing well.

'Kenny and Kris Boyd are experienced players and the manager knows what he's getting from them.

'I've been happy with the way I have been playing and the team was doing well during that period, picking up some good results.

Clark hopes he can persuade Rangers manager Ally McCoist to give him more game time in the coming months

'So yeah I was disappointed not to play against Raith but we have got loads of really good players at this club with a lot of international caps. You have got to expect that they will come in ahead of you at times and play.

'What's important is how you react to being left out.'

Goals from Jon Daly and Ian Black confirmed the victory in Methill and set-up a semi-final clash with Alloa.
