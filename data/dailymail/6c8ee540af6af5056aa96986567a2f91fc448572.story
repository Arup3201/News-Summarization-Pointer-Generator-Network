A couple looking to adopt a child have taken out a billboard on a busy highway to advertise their request.

Orna and Jay, who did not reveal their real names, told CBS2 they want their adopted two-year-old son Ben to have a sibling, but that the time-consuming adoption process is even more difficult for a second child because birth parents tend to look for childless couples.

To stand out from the crowd, the Maryland couple bought a bright yellow billboard on the busy New Jersey Turnpike, featuring a picture of themselves, their phone number, their website, and the words 'Loving couple looking to adopt.'

Desperate measures: Maryland couple Orna and Jay, who did not reveal their real names, took out billboard ad space on the New Jersey Turnpike advertising that they are looking to adopt

Complicated: They said they want their adopted son Ben to have a sibling, but that the time-consuming adoption process is even more difficult the second time around because birth parents tend to look for childless couples

While Jay, a sales executive, and Orna, a doctor, hail from Maryland, they chose to buy advertising space in New Jersey because birth mothers there only have 72 hours to change their mind.

Those in Maryland, on the other hand, are given a full 28 days to reverse their decision.

'We feel as a couple our goal is to market ourselves to as many people,' said Jay, who has been married to Orna for six years.

'To let them know there's an option for their 16-, 18-, 20-, or 25-year-old young woman who isnâ€™t ready to be a mom.'

The billboard, which just went up, will cost Jay and Orna a whopping $2,000 a month, but they believe it's worth it if it leads to an adoption.

Indeed, they explained that the whole
process of adopting Ben took about two years, but they have hope that their 
creative ad will make the process go a little faster this time.

Strategic: While Jay and Orna hail from Maryland, they chose to buy advertising space in New Jersey because birth mothers there only have 72 hours to change their mind. In Maryland, they have 28 days

'What we hope to find is that one unique situation where someone picks up the phone or goes to our website and says, "Hey I can give a great gift to this couple,"' said Jay.

On Adopt2013, the website listed on the billboard, Jay and Orno put forth their case as good parents who would provide a loving home for another adopted child.

The website states that they have a three-bedroom house in 'a neighborhood full of young families,' and that one of the top elementary schools in the area is located just next door.

'With 13 nieces and nephews all under the age of 13, our second child will be surrounded by children eager to play,' they add.

To circumvent this, they bought advertising space in New Jersey, where the grace period is just 72 hours
