A woman needed hospital treatment after screaming so hard doing the ice bucket challenge she dislocated her jaw.

Isabelle Roberts, 20, was taken to A&E to have her jaw put back into place when the internet craze for tipping cold water over yourself went painfully wrong last week.

Her video has now been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook after the challenge left her in agony.

Isabelle Roberts dislocated her jaw by screaming so hard when she undertook the ice bucket challenge

Her step-father poured the bucket of water over her after she accepted the challenge during a birthday party

Isabelle, from Tipton, West Midlands, said: 'The water was so cold so I screamed but as I did it my jaw just started to stick.

'I tried to close my mouth but it would not close, it was locked, and then I came to the realisation that something was up.

'Then my mum and sister came to the realisation and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to hospital.'

The shop worker had been celebrating her mother's birthday before deciding to take on the challenge.

Isabelle's 47-second video shows her thanking a friend for nominating her before nominating several friends and family.

Her step-father, John Kelley, 44, then pours the bucket over her. Isabelle screams twice after she is splashed with the icy water and then realises that her jaw won't move.

As she approaches the camera, the extent of the dislocation can be seen, as her face appears to have be stuck in a painful position. Two doctors later managed to click her jaw back into place.

Like millions of others around the world, she accepted the challenge to raise money for a Motor Neuron Disease charity

Isabelle's mother, Joanna Kelley, 44, who filmed the challenge, said: 'We were in the waiting room and everyone was laughing, they thought it was hilarious.

'The two doctors who put it back in place had heard about her before they saw her, and then when we went up to X-ray they were already laughing about it as well.

'Isabelle has taken it so well. At the time when it happened even I was laughing because you just don't expect anything bad to happen when you are doing something light hearted like that.

'But I think people should know that it can be quite dangerous.'

Isabelle added: 'Everyone has been saying it is really funny and it has been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook.

'As soon as it was clicked back into place it felt fine. It could have been a lot worse I guess.'

But after she was doused in cold water, was walked away in pain having dislocated her jaw by screaming

The 20-year-old sees the funny side though and says she is glad she has helped raise money for good cause

She added: 'You see all these videos all over Facebook and stuff but you would never in a million years think something like that would happen. The next morning when I woke up it was a bit sore but other than that it has been fine.

'I've been told I've got to only have liquid food for two weeks though, so it's a lot of soup for me at the moment.'

The Ice Bucket Challenge trend was started to raise awareness for ALS - the American abbreviation for Motor Neuron Disease.

It sees participants pour ice and water over themselves before asking other friends to do the same and encouraging them to donate to charity.

Isabelle donated £5 to the ALS Association after she was nominated and the charity announced on Friday that it has raised an amazing £75million in the last month through the online initiative.
