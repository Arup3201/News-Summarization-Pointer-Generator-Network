Louis van Gaal has faced Jose Mourinho, the monster he created, just once before in a competitive match – and lost.

And do you think the Manchester United manager is still bitter about the 2010 Champions League final that saw Mourinho's Inter Milan beat van Gaal's Bayern Munich with just 34 per cent possession? You bet.

'We have only played once and it was that game. And that honourable Howard Webb doesn't give a penalty to us. That game,' says a snarling van Gaal.

'I said congratulations (to Jose) afterwards. Not more because I don't say anything about that game.'

The role of van Gaal in Mourinho's career is well-documented. When the Dutchman took over at Barcelona in 1997, he decided not to sack Sir Bobby Robson's translator and instead promoted him to give him his first formal coaching job. The rest is history.

Sunday's Manchester United-Chelsea showdown at Old Trafford will be their second clash as rivals. The first four years ago had a huge personal effect on van Gaal who will be privately savouring the prospect of making amends this afternoon.

Bayern went into the European final as favourites at Real Madrid's Bernabeu. They had beaten Manchester United en route to the final and van Gaal could call upon Arjen Robben as well as future World Cup winners Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller and Miroslav Klose.

Yet Inter won with a double strike from unsung Argentine Diego Milito. Van Gaal still bears a grudge against English referee Webb, who two months later was at the centre of an infamous World Cup final between Spain and Holland.

In Madrid, van Gaal watched with growing anger as Webb let off Inter hatchet-man Walter Samuel for scything down Robben. Then, crucially, he didn't give Bayern a penalty at 0-0 when Maicon handled.

Van Gaal ended up losing the game and the following year his job – a huge blow to a manager who revels in his "iron" personality.

And he'll surely be aware that the man in the middle for Sunday's big game, Phil Dowd, was once taken to task by Sir Alex Ferguson for being overweight, though he has clearly slimmed down since then.

Despite the platitudes between van Gaal and Mourinho, it is hard for a mentor to see his protege overtake them.

It's happened to Mourinho too. Last season he was desperate to beat Liverpool at Anfield and deny his protege Brendan Rodgers the title, even though it ended up in the hands of a manager he dislikes, Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini.

Van Gaal is now motivated by chasing Mourinho. First of all, this afternoon and longer-term beating him to the Premier League title.

'He has won the championship in more than three countries. I am next with three, and I also want to do it here. Then I am equal again!' said van Gaal. 'He hasn't won as many titles overall as I have but he's done it in a shorter time.'

Van Gaal has been a champion in Holland, Spain and Germany, but Mourinho has been top dog in four countries – Portugal, England, Italy and Spain.

They first met in Spain 17 years ago and it was Mourinho's personality that helped him get a job on the training ground besides translation.

Sir Bobby Robson loved the way the young Mourinho would be able to communicate his instructions to big egos like Ronaldo and Hristo Stoichkov with firmness and intensity.

Van Gaal was also taken with his passion when he replaced Robson. 'We all had a meeting and he was angry that Sir Bobby was no longer coach. His anger was fantastic to see. So I said “You are my man”!

Tactically, the game at Old Trafford will be intriguing. United have used a record 30 different players in their opening eight league fixtures, testimony to the injury problems van Gaal has faced. Skipper Wayne Rooney is out of the game as he completes a three-game ban.

Chelsea's early success this season, they are still unbeaten in the league, has owed a great deal to their midfield playmaker Cesc Fabregas being on top form while United's equivalent Michael Carrick has been unable to play for the first-team so far because of injury though he did return for the under-21s against West Ham on Friday.

'He (Fabregas) is a very interesting player and he can also dominate a game. He makes a big part of the attacking play of Chelsea,' accepted van Gaal, who is likely to start with Ander Herrera to try and snuff out the Fabregas threat.

With Rooney out and van Gaal saying Falcao took a heavy kick in training on Friday, he will want the best out of former Chelsea player Juan Mata.

'I want to be a manager who can improve the qualities of players and that is a process,' he said of the £38million midfielder, who has not enjoyed the best first 12 months at Old Trafford.

Whoever is on the pitch however, the television cameras will regularly point to the dug-outs to see the two protagonists van Gaal and Mourinho.

For once, United won't be clear favourites for a game at Old Trafford. Their defensive resources have been stretched all season, hence conceding two at West Brom, two at home to Swansea, four at MK Dons and most startlingly, five at Leicester City in the Premier League.

But having lost to Mourinho in a big final, van Gaal will not want a repeat and goes into the game believing he could sample some kind of revenge.

'We can beat any team,' he says. 'We have made individual errors at the back but we have also shown this season we can score goals and beat any team.'
