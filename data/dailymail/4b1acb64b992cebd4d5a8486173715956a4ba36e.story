Hot off the heels of 3D-printed buildings, clothing and food, a Chinese company has crossed a national printing milestone.

Tech firm Sanya Si Hai 3D unveiled China’s debut 3D-printed car on Tuesday, a radiant gold sedan dubbed Shuya.

The electric-powered two-seater, which is capable of reaching speeds of up to 40 km/hr, went for a drive on the streets of Hainan province, southern China.

Shuya’s most distinctive feature is its blazingly orange exterior, a result of the Tyrant Gold filament used to fabricate the car.

The frame of the rechargeable battery-powered car was 3D-printed with a composite material, then combined with the conventionally manufactured components.

Shuya was printed in five days, at a cost of $1700 (11,000 yuan.) It required 500kg of the Tyrant Gold material at about 10 yuan per kg, with an extra 1000 yuan for electricity and labour.

The car is not the first of its kind-that honour belongs to American company Local Motors 3D, who unveiled the Strati back in September.

The 50-part car was exhibited at the 2014 International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago.

Sanya Si hai reviously created the worlds first fully functional boat in August, a two-meter long vessel which can fit two people.

The 35kg boat was printed with the companies renowned 13,000kg printer, which is capable of printing objects up to 4 metres in length with a height and breadth of about 2 metres. 

3D-printing technology is used in a growing number of industries from construction to aerospace.

Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' in households which allow consumers to print anything from clothing to replacement parts for broken household appliance.
