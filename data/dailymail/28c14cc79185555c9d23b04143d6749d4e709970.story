Actor Ray Winstone – famed for his tough-guy roles – has dismissed the building of the Olympic Stadium in 2012 as a ‘f***ing con’ and criticised the failure of the Games to revitalise London’s East End, where he was born.

The Sexy Beast and Scum star questioned whether Britain should have hosted the Olympics in 2012 when it was struggling to pay for essential services such as the NHS and schools. 

The actor likened ‘corrupt’ members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ‘white-collar gangsters’ and even dismissed Lord Coe as a ‘puppet’.

Actor Ray Winstone, who has criticised the failure of the Olympic Games to revitalise London's East End 

He said: ‘The building of the actual stadium was a complete f***ing con. 

'It wasn’t the Olympics themselves I objected to – I really admire the athletes and the effort and dedication they put in – I just looked around at East London and thought, “When we’ve built the hospitals and paid the teachers to be teachers and stopped closing all the fire stations down, maybe then we can afford this, but at the moment it’s an outrageous f***ing liberty.”’

He added: 'The Olympic organisation isn’t really about the sport, it’s about the building, and when I see the people who run the committee – not so much Lord Coe, but he’s a puppet, anyway – they look like white-collar gangsters to me. 

Mr Winstone branded the building of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford as a 'f***king con' 

'The corruption isn’t just a side issue, it’s at the heart of the whole enterprise.’

Winstone, 57, has criticised the Games before but his latest comments, which appear in his new autobiography, Young Winstone, are his strongest attacks to date. 

Lord Coe and the IOC declined to comment.
