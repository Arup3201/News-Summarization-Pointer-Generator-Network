Among the police pounding London's streets include a druid, four mediums - who believe the living can talk with the dead - and two pagans.

A Freedom of Information request into various 'non mainstream' religions practised by the the 31,000 bobbies working for the Met Police uncovered the details last week.

Bosses at the Met confirmed that they had one officer who was a druid.

According to the Romans, Druids practised human sacrifice 2,000 years ago, but modern day druidism - called neo-Druidism - focuses on the worship of nature, especially trees.

They also confirmed there were four officers who practised Spiritualism, which focuses on the belief that the living can communicate with the spirits of people who have died.

Spiritualists and mediums believe that there is life after death and that by holding seances, the dead can talk to the living, either through direct communication or the Ouija board.

Two officers list themselves as being Pagans, which worship a string of gods and festivals according to archaic religions which pre-date Christianity.

The list found that no officers were Devil worshippers - also known as Occultists - and no followers of Hare Krishna.

According to new European laws, employers will soon have to bow down to followers of 'non mainstream' religions and give them days off according to their religion's calendar.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission stated last week that human rights of people with 'profound personal beliefs' must be protected and that 'employees may assert the right to discuss their beliefs in the workplace and employers should not prevent such conversations'.

Druids, vegans and green activists should be given special treatment at work, according to ‘lunatic’ advice from the equalities watchdog.

The commission  warns employers that they risk ‘potentially costly legal action’ unless they allow staff to follow their ‘religion or belief rights’ in the workplace.

Druids should have the same rights at work as mainstream religious staff, according to the new guidelines

This could include giving believers time off to go on pilgrimages, such as druids and pagans going to Stonehenge, while environmentalists should be free to lecture other staff about their car use.

EHRC chief executive Mark Hammond said: 'The right of people to express their religious belief is a vital freedom.'

But Dominic Raab, a Tory MP and former international lawyer, blasted the new rules.

He said: ‘This is a recipe for every crank and crazy to take their boss for a ride. The EHRC has become an expensive taxpayer-funded laughing stock.’
