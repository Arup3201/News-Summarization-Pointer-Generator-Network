Through allegations of rape and involvement in prostitution, she has been the definition of a loyal but long-suffering wife.

But after months of standing by shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn – not to mention paying more than £1million in bail on his behalf – Anne Sinclair appears to have finally had enough.

She has kicked out the self-confessed sex addict and serial adulterer from their £5million Paris home, it was reported in France.

Strauss-Kahn, 63, has been embroiled 
in a catalogue of sex scandals since being charged with trying to rape a
New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

Multi-millionairess Miss Sinclair 
backed him through his legal battle and after those charges were 
dropped, she then supported him as further allegations emerged of sexual
abuse and links to a prostitution racket.

A month ago, however, the heiress and 
former television presenter finally told him to leave their apartment in
the chic Place des Vosges district, France's Closer magazine said.

Their 20-year marriage had been under 
pressure as Strauss-Kahn – once tipped as a future French president – 
became depressed at his lack of career options.

While he sat at home all
day 'feeling miserable', Miss Sinclair was busy working as editor of 
the French edition of online news website the Huffington Post, the 
magazine said.

It did not quote any sources for its 
story, but friends of Strauss-Kahn later told the Reuters news agency: 
'He's in a bad way. It's very sad. He's mostly just at home on his own 
while Anne is out and about with her new job. He's shunned by 
everybody.'

Strauss-Kahn was forced to quit as the
head of the IMF after he was accused of trying to rape chambermaid 
Nafissatou Diallo at New York's Sofitel Hotel.

After being held in the city's 
notorious Rikers Island prison, criminal charges were dropped but he 
still faces civil action for huge financial damages from his alleged 
victim.

He then returned to France last year 
only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French 
writer.

When those allegations were also dropped, he was charged with 
conspiring with pimps in Lille, northern France, to procure girls for 
sex parties around the world.

Strauss-Kahn is currently on bail for 
100,000 euros and banned from leaving France while prosecutors decide if
he should be brought to trial. In the media frenzy that followed his 
return to France last year, it emerged he had had up to ten separate 
affairs during his marriage. He confessed to regularly attending orgies 
and admitted he was addicted to his swingers' lifestyle.

A biography even told how Strauss-Kahn had once unsuccessfully attempted to seduce France's new First Lady Valerie Trierweiler.

The same book, called Les Strauss-Kahn, also revealed how Miss Sinclair had had her own affair with an unnamed lover in 2002.

In her only interview about her 
husband's errant ways since his arrest in New York, Miss Sinclair 
insisted in March that no one but her could judge their relationship.

She said: 'I am neither a saint nor a victim. I am a free woman.

'Nobody knows what goes on within a relationship and I defy anyone to judge mine.'
