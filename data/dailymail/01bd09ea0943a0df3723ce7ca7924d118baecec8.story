A pensioner was left bloodied and battered after being viciously attacked by a teenage mugger who stole less than £30 from her. 

Anne Anstey was on her way home from a Royal British Legion Club in Meadowfield, County Durham, when the 18-year-old dragged her to the ground and punched her. 

The 75-year-old was left cowering on the floor with blood streaming down her face as the teenager, Michael Kingshott, ran away with her handbag.

Mrs Anstey required stitches to the inside of her mouth and root canal dental treatment as a result of the attack. 

Durham Crown Court heard how the woman was walking home when Kingshott crept up behind her, threatening: 'Do you want this to get rough'. 

The 18-year-old, who was high on drugs and alcohol, pulled her to the ground and punched her on the left side of her face. 

Police discovered the woman's discarded handbag with £28 missing in the days after the attack. 

The court heard how Mrs Anstey was living in fear after the attack, and found herself constantly checking windows and doors at her home.  

Judge Peter Kelson QC told the teenager his motivation was purely financial, after his sister had earlier refused to give him money.

'You were clearly lying in wait when that lady left that club. 

'You were consumed with a cocktail of drink and drugs, walking the streets of that village cowardly looking for a victim.

'Elderly members of our society have every right to feel safe walking five minutes home from a place of leisure.

'What has society come to when an 18-year-old man lies cowardly in wait for a vulnerable old lady? It’s despicable.'

Scott Smith, defending, said it was the teen's first offence of violence and that he had been attacked himself four times while on remand. 

He added it had been an 'opportunistic' offence with no 'gratuitous violence'. 

Kingshott was convicted of robbery and jailed for four years yesterday.
