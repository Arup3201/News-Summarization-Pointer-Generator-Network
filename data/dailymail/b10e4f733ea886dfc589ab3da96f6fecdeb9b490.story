With rival Mitt Romney officially out of the 2016 presidential race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is now poised to clean up on the cash front and will host tonight a $100,000 a plate fundraiser for his political action committee.

Officially launched last Thursday, Bush's Right to Rise super PAC will hold a cash-gathering event tonight for the creme de la creme of New York that has even Wall Street Republicans blushing at the price of admission, according to Politico.

Tonight's fundraiser will be hosted at the Park Avenue home of billionaire Henry Kravis, a private equity mogul, and wife Marie-Josée.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is pictured here on Tuesday at the Keeping the Promise: A Florida Education Summit, sponsored by Bush's Foundation for Florida's Future, at the Florida State University Alumni Center in Tallahassee. The Republican presidential frontrunner is cleaning up cash this week even as his campaign makes embarassing missteps

Kravis is among the richest 100 Americans, and, along with George Roberts, a fellow founding partner of private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, he is one of the GOP's top financiers.

A longtime supporter of the Bush family, Kravis supported the the presidential campaigns of both Jeb's father, George W., and brother, George H.W. He and Roberts are separately listed as having given at least $100,000 to the Republican Party the year that George H.W. was elected to the Oval Office.

Known to be a backer of gay marriage, he is now emptying his pockets for Bush the younger, who ruffled conservatives' feathers last month when he released a statement saying Americans must 'show respect' for same-sex couples 'making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections.'

A spokesperson for Bush wouldn't confirm the per person cost of tonight's bonanza to Politico, but the publication says it was confirmed by two other sources.

A Wall Street executive who was invited told the publication, 'I shook my head when I heard the number.'

Still the only major Republican to have stated his intentions to explore a presidential bid, Bush has an early fundraising lead over a dozen possible Republican opponents.

His early frontrunner status hasn't been all rainbows and sunshine, however.

Already this week an aide had to resign a day after his new position with Bush's PAC as chief technology adviser was revealed after Buzzfeed caught him deleting years old tweets that were defamatory to women.

The same day Bush came under scrutiny for accidentally allowing the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of people who emailed him while he was governor of Florida to be included in a massive release of his correspondence from that time.
