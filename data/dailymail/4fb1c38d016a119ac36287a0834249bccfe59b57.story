Kellie Maloney has announced she is planning to return to boxing by taking on fighters with a new management company.

Maloney is undergoing gender reassignment, and once that is complete she hopes to resume a career that saw Lennox Lewis shepherded to world heavyweight titles in the 1990s.

Maloney, under her previous name Frank, called time on a 30-year career in October 2013, handing back licences to the British Boxing Board of Control after growing disillusioned with the sport.

Along with Lewis, Maloney also took the likes of Paul Ingle and Scott Harrison to world titles.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I haven't really done anything for 18 months other than concentrate on my gender reassignment. I'm actually missing being out there in the real world. I've got a lot of talks lined up to do - talking and diversity meetings, which I enjoy.

'But my biggest love is sports. I'm forming a sports management company, which we'll be announcing in the new year, and part of me wants to go back into boxing.

'I've consulted a couple of promoters, one British based and one European based. Part of me wants to go back and start again as Kellie Maloney because I've always been the underdog in boxing. I've always been fighting the establishment. That's part of my make-up.

'If I was to succeed this time, it would be bigger than taking Lennox Lewis to the heavyweight title. I'm meeting my family in the new year and we'll sit down and talk about it. Some of my family like the idea and some don't like the stress and pressure it brings. As it stands, I'm leaning towards going back into boxing unless something drastic happens in the new year.'

The 61-year-old added: 'I want to know how the fans would take to it as well. That's also important to me. I don't want to be insulted. I want to walk into the arena and be given the respect and credit I deserve.'
