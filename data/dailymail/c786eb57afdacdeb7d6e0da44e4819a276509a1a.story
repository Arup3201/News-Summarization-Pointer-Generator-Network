It may be the catch of the season for America's baseball fans.

But it wasn't any of the players' brilliant catch. Instead, it was that of grandmother Virginia Smith who was watching the San Francisco Giants vs. CO Rockies game in the stands Tuesday night.

A video has gone viral and the pensioner has become a star performer on TV shows across the west coast of the US.

Here it is: Virginia Smith catches the ball in her own glove she takes to watch games in California

The Santa Rosa resident in California 
has been playing softball for 39 years, but she stole the show from top 
fit players as she made the easy catch.

She
 was well prepared, because she has been carrying the same glove to 
every game she has attended over the years. But this was the first time 
she had caught a foul ball.

The
 ball was hit by 40-year-old Rockies first baseman Todd Helton, who no 
doubt got a shock as he watched the pensioner reach out for the ball.
