The International Monetary Fund has appealed to the U.S Government to manage its finances better following the eleventh hour deal struck by politicians to avoid a catastrophic debt default.

Asian stock markets rallied after American leaders struck the deal to end a 16-day Government shutdown and raise the country's debt ceiling late last night.

With only hours to spare until the $16.7 trillion debt limit was reached, Congress passed and sent a waiting President Barack Obama legislation to allow more borrowing and reopen government agencies.

And while IMF managing director Christine Lagarde welcomed the 'important and necessary' deal, she called for a more stable approach to America's long term finances.

In a statement, Ms Lagarde said: 'It will be essential to reduce 
uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt
limit in a more durable manner.

'We also continue to encourage the U.S. to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.'

The deal only permits the Treasury to borrow normally until February 7 and fund the government through January 15 next year.

Calls: President Obama called for the U.S to 'get out of the habit of governing by crisis' following the deal

The Tokyo stock market, the region's heavyweight, gained as much as 1.1 percent after news of the deal broke.

Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea also rebounded from losses.

China and Japan, which each own more than $1 trillion of Treasury securities, appealed earlier to Washington for a quick settlement.

There was no indication whether either government had altered its debt holdings.

China's official Xinhua News Agency had accused Washington of jeopardizing other countries' dollar-denominated assets.

It called for 'building a de-Americanized world,' though analysts say global financial markets have few alternatives to the dollar and U.S. government debt for trading and holding currency reserves.

Asian companies and investors had expressed confidence the United States would avoid a default, but had sold Treasurys to avoid possible losses if Washington delayed repayment.

Others put off buying stocks that might be exposed to a U.S. downturn.

Ms Lagarde's comments seemed to echo those made by President Obama following the deal.

He said that the U.S must 'get out of the habit of governing by crisis' following the stand-off that had brought the country to the brink of economic catastrophe.

Deal done: The Grand Canyon has now re-opened after it was closed during the federal government shutdown

Anger: Steven Ahrenholz, a Federal worker put on temporary unpaid leave, protests outside the Department of Health and Human Services CDC offices earlier this week

Moments earlier, he had officially signed a Democrat-led bill ended the Government shutdown.

Both halves of Congress had been racing to beat a midnight deadline imposed by the Treasury Department, which declared that unless it had a larger global credit card, the US would no longer have enough cash on hand to pay interest to its creditors.

Obama added that when the dust settles, he wants to see a 'sensible budget that is responsible, that is fair.'
