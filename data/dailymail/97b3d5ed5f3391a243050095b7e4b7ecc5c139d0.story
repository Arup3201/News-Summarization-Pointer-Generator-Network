A film billed as the most dangerous ever made is making a return to the big screen nearly 35 years after its original release.

Noel Marshall’s action-adventure film Roar was originally released in 1981 and its 11-year production is infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew.

The film revolves around a wildlife preservationist who lives with his wife and children alongside a number of wild lions, tigers, cheetahs and elephants.

Its re-release is due to be shown at a handful of cinemas in the US in April, and will be made available to the wider public on a number of platforms as well.

The film features Marshall himself, who plays the starring character of Hank, while his real-life partner Tippi Hedren plays the part of his onscreen wife.

Hedren’s daughter, Melanie Griffith, is also featured in the film alongside Marshall’s three sons and a number of animal trainers.

While the plot line for the film itself – two lions putting a family at serious risk by battling for domination – is action-packed, it is in fact the back story that is the most chilling aspect of the tale.

The idea for the film came about when Marshall and Hedren discovered an abandoned plantation house overrun by a large pride of lions while touring wildlife preserves in Africa.

Hoping to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by big cats in captivity, they approached a number of animal trainers for help make the concept for the film a reality.

The couple then began adopting and breeding lions in their home in Los Angeles and for six years the family of six lived alongside the pack.

They eventually moved to a range north of Los Angeles and began filming.

The trailer for the film documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production.

Marshall is featured on a motorbike at the start of a film trailer, riding through a pack of lions as one of them strikes out at him as he passes by.

Later he is tackled to the ground by another lion as a humorous review from HitFix appears on the screen: ‘It’s like Walt Disney went insane and shot a snuff version of Swiss Family Robinson’.

Genuine fear can be seen etched onto the faces of the various crew members as they are confronted on numerous occasions by the pack.

Seventy members of cast and crew were injured during the course of the film, but the lions were unharmed

The video concludes with the credits and the various injuries sustained by the cast members.

Hedren suffered a broken leg, Griffith needed facial reconstruction surgery and Noel Marshall was gored so many times he was eventually hospitalised with gangrene.

The film’s cinematographer, Jan de Bont – who later went on to direct Die Hard – required 220 stitches after he was scalped by a lion.

The film will be re-released 34 years after it debuted in 1981 and will be shown at a handful of US cinemas

No lions were harmed during the making of the film, however.

Drafthouse Films partnered with Olive Films to re-release the film, which will be available on numerous platforms later in the summer.
