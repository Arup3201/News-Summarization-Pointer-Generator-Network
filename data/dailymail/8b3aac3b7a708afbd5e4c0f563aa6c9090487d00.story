The transfer window may have slammed shut after a month of activity, but Premier League clubs will still be in a position to speak to a select group of Europe's elite before the end of the season. 

There are a raft of players, including Real Madrid's Sami Khedira, Dani Alves of Barcelona, and the Shakhtar Donetsk forward Luiz Adriano, who has scored nine times in the Champions League this season, available to sign ahead of the 2015-16 season on a pre-contract agreement.

Sportsmail takes a look at the players who are available on a bosman transfer- firstly in an XI format - and then with a collection of notable others.

Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) 

Interest: Manchester United, Liverpool

The man who saved two Holland penalties in the World Cup semi-final could well be leaving Serie A at the end of this season. 

Argentina's stopper - who was shortlisted for the Golden Glove award in Brazil - would be very handy for most sides. 

One wonders whether Brendan Rodgers fancies deploying someone down at Stadio Luigi Ferraris?

Dani Alves (Barcelona)

Interest: Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham  

Alves has already made it clear that he won’t be staying at the Nou Camp beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in Europe.

A veteran of the Champions League but still with the vibrancy a full back in England requires, the Brazilian will have many suitors.

Fabian Schar (FC Basle)

Interest: Arsenal 

One of the emerging central defenders in Europe and with designs of bigger things. Excellent against Liverpool in the Champions League earlier this season and has plenty of admirers.

Only 22 so would require a compensation fee to be paid, but that would come out at less than Basle’s asking price otherwise.

Andrea Ranocchia (Inter Milan)

Interest: Liverpool 

He says he'll stay at Inter Milan but Premier League clubs with a space in central defence could do worse than have a chat with Italy international Ranocchia.

The tenacious 26-year-old is a regular in Roberto Mancini's defence but might be interested in a fresh start if offered an exciting opportunity elsewhere in Europe.

Alvaro Pereira (Sao Paulo)

Interest: Tottenham 

Uruguay’s chosen left back during the summer World Cup, Pereira was the man to continue playing despite a heavy clash with Raheem Sterling in England’s group stage defeat. Loves to gallop forward.

Sami Khedira (Real Madrid)

Interest: Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United 

The real standout player available. It’s no secret as to Khedira’s obvious ability - with Arsenal interested in the central midfielder - and, although his wages will undoubtedly be high, not many would pass up the opportunity to add the German. Bayern Munich are however, the favourites to land the 27-year-old.  

Alberto Aquilani (Fiorentina) 

Interest: QPR 

Aquilani was sold to Fiorentina in the summer of 2012 after three disappointing years at Anfield in which he started only nine Premier League games. 

But the Italy international is yet to commit to a new deal with the Serie A side, and Premier League suitors could be tempted to track the out-of contract midfielder.

Stipe Pletikosa (FC Rostov) 

At 35, the goalkeeper - with 114 caps for Croatia before retiring from international football - may be looking for one last move before he calls it a day for good. Would surely only act as a No 2, but definitely someone who could act as reliable cover. 

Nigel De Jong (AC Milan) 

Looking for that little bit of added steel in midfield? De Jong may well be your man. A fierce competitor and someone who Manchester City have missed a touch this season. 

Maxi Pereira (Benfica)

Bombs forward from right back and one of the more exuberant fliers to watch in Europe.

Ignazio Abate (AC Milan)

Played in Italy's back four during the World Cup and did so impressively. A good age at 28. 

Yoann Gourcuff (Lyon)

Has never scored enough goals given his position and the quality he has, but would still provide a touch of class to a range of sides. 

Andre-Pierre Gignac (Marseille)

Not keen on signing a new deal, with the striker - linked with Arsenal and Newcastle - seemingly on his way.  

Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro)

Interest: Liverpool, Tottenham 

Liverpool failed to sign the winger in the summer because Dnipro dug their heels in, but the Ukrainian side must be regretting that now. Interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free. It’s a matter of who gets there first.

Andre Ayew (Marseille)

Interest: Liverpool, West Ham, QPR 

Always one who is talked about when a window comes around, and January was no different, with Queens Park Rangers having had a bid rebuffed. Marseille won’t see any value in taking the money and running, so it’ll be interesting to see who courts the Ghanaian livewire.

Eduardo Vargas (Napoli, on loan at Queens Park Rangers)

Interest: QPR, Arsenal 

Is QPR merely a shop window for the Chilean? Perhaps, perhaps not. Harry Redknapp will be well aware Vargas is out of contract and - should Rangers have designs of consolidating in the Premier League, they could do a lot worse than to get this one sorted. The one thing that may work against them is question marks over which division they’ll be in next year.

Luiz Adriano (Shakhtar Donetsk)

Interest: Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool 

Simply put, the striker cannot stop scoring. It’s nine (yes, nine) goals in the Champions League already, including five away at BATE Borisov. He is a late developer and an unknown commodity. Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenahm are all interested.
