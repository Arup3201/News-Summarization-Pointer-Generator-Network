A Myrtle Beach Woman is recovering after her ex-boyfriend allegedly bit off half of her nose during a vicious attack earlier this month. 

Michele Messer, 35, broke up with Chris Campbell, 39, a few weeks before running into him on February 8, the afternoon he is accused of attacking her.

She said she saw her ex - who is also an accused murderer - at about 2pm and he asked if they could go outside to talk, but he started beating her the moment they stepped into her van.

 'I remember him just beating me everywhere, punching me everywhere, mainly in the face,' Messer said of the attack

The mother-of-two said that he locked the van's doors and she felt him hitting her and felt his teeth on her face.

After slipping in and out of consciousness, she asked him what happened, and he told her, 'I bit your nose off'.

'I remember him just beating me everywhere, punching me everywhere, mainly in the face,' Messer told WMBF. 

Messer said she saw blood 'smeared and everywhere' in her van, and that Campbell then tried to choke her to death. 

She was finally able to open the car door and fall out of the van, and when witnesses saw, they called the police. 

Campbell - who was out of jail on $75,000 bond for a 2013 murder charge - and Messer were business partners as well as a couple, according WBTW.

Campbell was originally charged with criminal domestic abuse but later charged with attempted murder

Messer was able to open the car door while being attacked and fall out of the van, and when witnesses saw her fall out of the blood-stained car, they called the police

Messer said that she and Campbell had been 'very amicable' and 'getting along fine' the day he attacked her

Messer told ABC that she and Campbell had been 'very amicable' and 'getting along fine' the day he attacked her.

She added that he never gave a reason for the attack but that he threatened to kill her after biting off her nose.

When Campbell was originally charged with criminal domestic violence, Messer said she was outraged and that she feared that Campbell would return.

'I'm sitting here permanently disfigured, a body part is missing and he intended to kill me. That was his intent. I mean, it was very clear what he said to me,' Messer said to WMBF.

Campbell's charge was later changed to attempted murder when police discovered his intent to kill through the force he used and the fact that he choked her. 

Messer said she is thankful that his charge has been raised, especially because she is a mother. 

She feels that she unintentionally put her kids 'in a really bad situation' and that she has lots of guilt for doing so.

She hopes, however, that her story can raise awareness of the over-arching issues of domestic violence.

Messer wants people to know her story so she can become a voice for domestic-violence victims. 

She said that the issue is no longer about Campbell, but it's about the prevention and safety of others.
