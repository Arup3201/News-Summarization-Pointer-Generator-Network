The UK is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to economic damage from flooding, a new survey has shown.

The country ranked seventh on a league table behind the US, China, India, Bangladesh, Germany and Japan.

Tightly packed buildings, crowded cities, and infrastructure built on flood planes all heightened the possible damage which could be caused by heavy rainfall.

We are also the most vulnerable country to extratropical cyclones, the type of storm that has been hitting the country over the last few months, and which features a very tight circle of low pressure at its centre.

Maplecroft, the firm which produced the rankings, said that this type of storm was the most disruptive and costly kind  to affect northern Europe, and warned that they could become more common.

The findings are part of the firm’s fourth annual Natural Hazards Risk Atlas, which assessed 197 countries on physical and economic exposure to 12 types of natural hazards, including flooding, storm surge, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, wildfires and volcanoes.

Dr Richard Hewston, Maplecroft’s Principal Environment Analyst, said: 'The future scale of the problem will depend heavily on the government continuing to build resilience and apply resources through flood mitigation and risk management schemes.'

The news comes as homeowners have been warned that it may take until Christmas to repair their properties.

Ministers have been under pressure to respond rapidly to the crisis which has seen about 5,500 homes flooded.

But following a meeting in Downing Street yesterday, insurance firms claimed it could take up to a year for homes to be fully restored and that all household premiums could soon rise.

A summit called by ministers in Whitehall saw insurers challenged over the time it takes to pay out claims and the process customers have to follow.

Cabinet ministers called for an end to costly premium rate telephone lines for customers calling insurers for help. Consumer watchdog champion Which? raised concerns that claimants were often forced dial 084 or 087 numbers, running up bills of up to 41p a minute.

Floods minister Dan Rogerson insisted the industry had ‘got the message’ about the helplines - used by 79 per cent of home insurers including big names such as Ageas, Aviva, Axa, Churchill, Direct Line, Esure, Hiscox, Royal and Sun Alliance, and Virgin, according to Which? research - during talks in the Cabinet Office.

‘When it comes to telephone numbers, yes, we raised that and the industry are happy to say that they are taking that back to their members to deal with,’ he told BBC News.

‘We got the message across today that we would hope that they would address that and the Association of British Insurers and the members' companies that are represented there - of course, they can't speak directly for every single member company - but they took that away and they will be looking at that and we will keep that situation under review.’

The Chamber of Commerce has also revealed that flooding has cost businesses in Somerset alone more than £1.2million in just six weeks.

Somerset Chamber of Commerce warned that the figures are 'only going to increase' as many businesses said it was too early to gauge the impact of the crisis.

The chamber asked 170 businesses in the county to take part in their study, with 71 able to estimate damage caused so far.
