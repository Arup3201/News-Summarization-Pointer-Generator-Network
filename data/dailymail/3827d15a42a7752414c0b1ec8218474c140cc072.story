A six-year-old boy has died after he was pulled unresponsive from a suburban Chicago swimming pool during a summer camp program.

Michael Duda from Justice was swimming with 72 other children at a Bridgeview public pool as part of the Village of Justice Park District summer camp.

Bridgeview police said in a press release that the children were being cared for by 10 adult camp counselors.

Tragic death: Michael Duda, six, was pulled unresponsive from a pool during a summer camp outing and later died

Police are now interviewing camp counselors and witnesses and have seen security footage taken of the pool.

'We have reviewed the videotape taken from the pool security cameras, but they do not show much other than the boy being rescued from the shallow end of the pool,' Chief Walter Klimek, Bridgeview Police Department told ABC7.

Michael Duda was pulled from the shallow end of the pool at 1.43pm Tuesday. He was unable to breath and lifeguards immediately began CPR.

There were about 300 children swimming in the pool, fewer than the 345 allowed capacity.

Investigation: The public pool at Bridgeview has been closed while police work to determine what caused the child to become unresponsive

Supervision: Lifeguards were on duty and there were 10 adult camp counselors overseeing the 73 children who were a part of the camp group when Michael Duda drowned

Paramedics arrived and the little boy was transported to the intensive care unit at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.

According to CBS, Duda was listed as having a 'weak pulse' at 8am Wednesday morning, but died that evening.

'We are not sure exactly what happened, but we do know based on interviews, the lifeguards acted quickly,' Klimek told ABC7.

Klimek said the police department is still interviewing witnesses to determine what could have caused Duda to become unresponsive.

The pool has been closed for three days while police continue their investigations.

The Justice camp runs all summer, with children divided into groups according to their age.

They participate in music, games, and craft activities, as well as weekly field trips to the local pool and other sites.
