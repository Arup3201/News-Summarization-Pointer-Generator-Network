From suddenly being sunburnt on a breezy day, to getting caught in a localised shower, the weather has unlimited ways of catching us out.

But now a company in California has created a wearable ‘environmental tracker’ that could put an end to these weather woes.

The clip-on device looks like a cloud and gathers accurate readings of a wearer’s immediate environment, to warn them of possible local climatic challenges.

The CliMate is a wearable weather station.

It claims to accurately track the humidity, UV rays and temperature of your immediate environment, wherever the wearer is.

It is wireless, wearable, light and small.

The device wireless syncs HUT information via Bluetooth to an accompanying app every 15 minutes.

It shows data using an image of a plant that wears sunglasses and scarves to reflect the temperature.

The device tags the location and time of a collection of data, so if lots of people are using CliMates, an accurate local weather map can be generated.

The coin cell battery inside lasts for six months.

The CliMate cloud uses a ‘pin-point precise’ sensor that wirelessly measures humidity, UV exposure and temperature (known as HUT).

It will then send these readings to an accompanying iOS and Android app every 15 minutes, when it launches in September.

The San Francisco-based creators said the device will help users create their ‘own friendly environment’.

‘Excessive humidity, UV and temperature (HUT) damage goes way beyond the skin-deep.

'It negatively affects your health through illness and allergies, your mood and often times even your work performance and personal life,’ they firm wrote on its Kickstarter website, where they are trying to raise funds to put the gadget into large scale production.

CliMate wearers can also select their skin and SPF cream types when outside, 
and the app will warn them when it's time to reapply cream, to help 
them avoid becoming sunburnt.

Rooti - the company behind CliMate - explained the device is more accurate than a weather station which covers large swathes of land, as it is closer to an individual’s location.

It also said the device is more accurate than previous wearable weather trackers.

All the data the device collects will be shown in an app.

A person’s surrounding environment is presented as a plant that changes according to the readings.

For example, the plant appears to wrap up in a scarf when it is cold, and has sunglasses and burnt leaves when it is hot.

The app collates all the data into daily, weekly and monthly charts so that users can see long-term changes in their environment.

If, in the future, lots of people wear the devices, a crowd-sourced map can be created to show people local accurate weather information.

‘Each piece of user data sent via the CliMate app to our cloud server will add a piece to a massive P2P interactive map. Be part of the first crowd sourced real-time weather map,’ the company said.

Michael Li, the founder of Rooti, added that the device is mainly designed for people who spend a lot of time outside, as well as those who like to avoid the sun.

‘The product will be especially useful to parents with young children and to collectors of valuables such as art and wine who need to constantly monitor their indoors environment,’ he said.

Devices can pre-ordered in one of five colours for $39 (£23 plus shipping). CliMates are expected to be shipped in September.
