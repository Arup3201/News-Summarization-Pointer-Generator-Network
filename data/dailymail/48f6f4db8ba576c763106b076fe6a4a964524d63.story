A wildfire that sparked in a wooded area forced panicked horse owners to turn their livestock loose as they evacuated the area in Oklahoma City yesterday.

Before being contained, the raging fire caused swathes of cedar trees to explode into flame as the wind-whipped blaze reached them in the North-East of the city.

Oklahoma City set a record for the number of days in a year with temperatures above 100 and the near unrelenting heat wave this summer meant conditions were ideal for grass fires.

Dee Corley, a stable owner in a nearby
area, took in horses that had been evacuated while an employee picked 
up wandering strays to prevent traffic accidents.

She took in 25 horses as well as 11 dogs and two cats before the fire was eventually contained late on last night.

She refused to accept payment but was considering taking hay donations.

She said: 'I'm just glad I can help. That's what it's all about,'

Southerly winds gusting up 
to 25 miles per hour along with low humidity and drought conditions made
the wildfire difficult to contain and 15 properties were thought to have been destroyed.

About 200 fire fighters kept the blaze 
from spreading north to more populated areas while two National Guard 
helicopters dumped water on the fire.

Neighbouring cities and counties also
sent reinforcements.

'They burn extremely hot and they burn very, very fast. A lot of times when it hits those, that's what really advances the fire.

'We're going to be mopping up hotspots for some time.'

In neighbouring Texas yesterday, fire fighters were also using helicopters to battle a blaze that quickly consumed 3,000 acres.

The authorities were evacuating homes along Possum Kingdom Lake, mostly by boat because main roads were cut off.

A Texas Forest Service spokesman said. 'We do not have any confirmed reports of injuries or structure losses,'

Most of Texas has been under extreme drought for the past 11 months and persistent high temperatures continue to plague most of the state.

A ban on outdoor burning is in place in 251 of Texas' 254 counties due to the drought.
