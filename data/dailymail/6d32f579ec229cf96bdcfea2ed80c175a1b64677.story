A major travel insurance firm is refusing to cover skiers not wearing a helmet on the slopes this winter.

Essential Travel claims to be the first British firm to adopt such a policy as part of their safety campaign, launched after the death of Liam Neeson’s wife, actress Natasha Richardson who died after an apparent minor fall on the slopes in 2009.

It is thought that other insurers may now follow suit, adopting similar policies.

Ms Richardson, 45, died after sustaining a head injury during a skiing lesson at the Mont Tremblant resort in Canada. She was not wearing a helmet at the time and her death prompted a debate about ski safety with some experts calling for head protection to become mandatory.

About 77 per cent of British skiers claim to wear a helmet on the slopes, up from 62 per cent in 2010 according to an Essential Travel survey.

Spokesman Stuart Bensusan said: ‘Whilst it is true that a helmet does not reduce all sports injury, it seriously reduces the risk of potentially fatal injuries.

‘That alone warrants making wearing helmets compulsory and we choose to completely support safety-conscious skiers by rewarding them with reduced premiums and bonus discounts.’

The company admitted that while it may not always be able to prove whether or not a customer had been wearing a helmet, it would examine medical records and doctors’ notes for clues.

The firm’s campaign, Use Your Head, has been backed by several tour operators and charities including Headway, Ellis Brigham, and Neilson, with several firms offering discounts on holidays if they book insurance through Essential Travel.

Peter McCabe, chief executive of brain injury association
Headway, said: ‘There is a general misconception that only a major 
impact will lead to death or disability from a head injury.

‘However, the truth of the matter is that sometimes even minor bangs to the head can have serious consequences.’

Biggest factor: Excessive drinking has been identified as one of the biggest factors behind skiing accidents

Karyn Climans, from Tail-Wags helmet covers said: 'Wearing a safety helmet while skiing, biking, skating and tobogganing is as important as wearing a safety belt while driving.

'Even if you're an experienced skier or cyclist, it only takes 30 seconds of distraction or some other careless person on the slopes to cause serious injury.'

Insure&Go and Direct Travel Insurance confirmed that their customers were not currently required to wear a helmet but would not comment on whether they were due to amend their policies.

Previously, skiers were warned that they could invalidate their insurance if they were found to be under the influence of alcohol on the slopes.

Excessive drinking has been identified as one of the biggest factors behind skiing accidents.
