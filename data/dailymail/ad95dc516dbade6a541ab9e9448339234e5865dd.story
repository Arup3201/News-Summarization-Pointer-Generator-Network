Her role as Queen of Spain is not one she's taken lightly since her ascent to the throne earlier this - and her appearance today was no exception.

Queen Letizia, 42, spoke passionately before hundreds of people at the 25th Anniversary Ceremony of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation in Madrid.

Wearing a smart but chic suit, purple and blue blouse and knotted belt, the Spanish royal exuded style, as always, at the event this afternoon.

Ready for business:  Queen Letizia of Spain today attended the 25th Anniversary Ceremony of the Spanish National Transplant Organization  in Madrid, Spain

She wore her hair in its trademark loose style and carried a vibrant pink clutch bag as she mingled with other speakers and guests at the event.

The independent royal flew solo at the presentation today and was last seen with her husband at the Real Academia Española, the official royal institution charged with overseeing the Spanish language, last week.

Speaking out: The royal, who carries out numerous independent duties, spoke passionately at the event

Fresh: Despite a hectic schedule - and trip to Norway last week - the Spanish monarch looked radiant

Catching up: The Spanish Minister of Health, Social Services and Equality Ana Mato (L) and Queen Letizia of Spain enjoyed a quick chat

The royal couple, who were fresh from a visit to the Netherlands, were launching a new Spanish language dictionary in Madrid and had certainly dressed up for the occasion.

After listening to the presentation, the couple, who had looked on intently throughout, posed for a photo with the official Spanish language dictionary, which is now in its 23rd edition.

Letizia had spent the morning at the Real Casa de Correos, a Madrid palace, where she helped launch a campaign to improve public health.

Pretty in purple: The thoughtful Royal had seemingly matched her top to her eyeshadow for the occasion 

Entitled 'women for the heart', the initiative, which is supported by the Mapfre Foundation, aims to boost public awareness of cardiovascular health.

The two events came at the end of a busy week for Letizia and Felipe, who travelled to the Netherlands on Wednesday for a meeting with their Dutch counterparts at the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague.

For their part, Letizia and Felipe have enjoyed a busy four months since taking the Spanish throne on the 19th June, with several international tours, among them to France, Morocco and the Netherlands, already under their collective belt.

More recently, the pair have attended events all over Spain, among them today's appointments in Madrid, and have spearheaded major national events such as Spanish National Day on Sunday. 

Passion: Just last week she was an event entitled 'women for the heart', which aims to boost public awareness of cardiovascular health
