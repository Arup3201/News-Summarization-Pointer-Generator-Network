Guilty: Rapist Mawawe Karam who exposed himself in front of the judge and shouted 'I'm guilty, I'm guilty'

A rapist exposed himself to a judge when he was brought before a court to give his plea yesterday.

Mawawe Ibraham Karam, 28, was due to stand trial accused of raping a 17-year-old in Nottingham city centre next week, after he originally pleaded not guilty.

But after exposing himself, he was removed from the Nottingham courtroom and could be heard shouting 'I'm guilty, I'm guilty'.

After pleading guilty, Karam asked 
Judge Stokes to sentence him that day, repeatedly shouting: 'Please 
judge, please sentence me today, please.'

He was later brought back before the 
judge and changed his plea to guilty.

Karam was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court today for ten years for rape and the theft of the victim's mobile phone.

Nottinghamshire Police said they were not present during the hearing yesterday but are aware of reports the man exposed himself.

The court heard how Karam dragged a vulnerable girl, 17, into an alleyway and raped her in the early hours of March 25 this year.

Karam left her lying semi-naked in the street, taking her mobile phone with him.

She was not found until two hours later after a passer-by heard the girl shouting for help and raised the alarm.

Karam, a Sudanese immigrant, was also placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register and recommended for deportation after serving his sentence.

Detective Chief Inspector Louise 
Jordan, who led the investigation, said: 'Karam targeted his victim 
after finding her alone in the street.

'He took advantage of her vulnerability, dragged her into an alleyway out of view, and subjected her to a horrific assault.

'He then left her lying in the street, semi-naked, taking with him her mobile phone – her only means of contact.

'She has little recollection of the 
ordeal but found the bravery to face her attacker in court today where 
justice was done and Karam was handed a lengthy sentence.'

She added: 'I hope that his 
sentencing will signal an end to this difficult and painful chapter of 
the victim’s life and she can in some way begin to look forward to her 
future.'

The court previsouly heard Karam came to the UK illegally, but had since been given indefinite leave to remain.
