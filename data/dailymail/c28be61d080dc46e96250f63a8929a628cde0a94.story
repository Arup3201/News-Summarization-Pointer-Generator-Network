Proud of her record-breaking afro, Aevin Dugas says her hair is inspiring legions of women to ditch chemical straighteners and 'go natural'.

The 37-year-old, whose hair entered the Guinness Book of Records at 4ft 4ins around, says everyone from toddlers to grandmothers are following in her footsteps.

Aevin said: 'At one time I strived to get hair that was bone straight and now all I want is it big and poofy'.

Aevin Dugas boasts the world's biggest afro - measuring an incredible four-and-a-half foot around the middle

Aevin struggles to see out from underneath her extravagant hairdo if she does not style it up properly

14 years in the making, Aevin says that she loves her bouncy hair

She believes her voluminous hair may
 have grown even bigger, but she cannot reveal its size until Guinness 
take an official measurement.

'When my hair is stretched out to its complete length and pressed, it 
goes down to my butt. But I don't wear it like that because it looks 
weird.'

The newly single care worker is proud of her unique style but usually 
ties her hair back when going on first dates, only revealing her secret 
later.

'I did tell one guy and he was shocked and he Googled me and was like 'oh, wow'.

'But then when I saw him again - he was wearing an afro too.'

Despite loving her hair, she has to tie it back while driving as it is so difficult to see past it

On first dates, Aevin likes to restrain her afro as she says it can be 'overwhelming' for new people

Aevin, who has won fans from Brazil to Italy, has spent the last 14 years growing her hair.

Her jaw-dropping look brings her attention wherever she goes but it does
 have its drawbacks as she often gets it caught in trees, car doors and 
people's earrings.

It can also take two days to wash and dry and is so big she 
struggles to see clearly out from beneath it - which means she cannot 
drive with her 'hair up'.

To get her hair ready for a night out she shampoos it and then uses up to five conditioners.

She then puts her hair into two French braids and from then it takes about two days to dry.

But the positives far outweigh the negatives and she has become a hero in her hometown of Napoleonville, Louisiana.

Her biggest joy is inspiring young girls to stop using chemical straighteners, which can cause long-lasting damage to hair.

Hair washing has turned into a long-drawn out affair as it takes her two days to wash and dry it all in sections

However, Aevin is thrilled with the results and is keen to encourage other Africa-Americans to let their hair grow naturally

She said: 'I don't know why but there's something very important to me 
about little girls appreciating my hair and then wanting to wear their 
hair the same.

'I tell them there is nothing that I did special, there is no magical formula, we are born with our hair like this.'

Aevin was originally inspired by a picture of her mum Deborah Dugas 
wearing an afro in the sixties - and she remains one of her biggest fans
 today.

Mrs Dugas, 62, who runs a care home, said: 'I'm humbled by the fact she 
did this because she liked my natural hair, way before she was born.

Aevin getting her hair tended to at a salon in Reserve, Louisiana. Her mother says that she is particularly proud of her daughter for wearing her afro before it became fashionable

'It was about half the size of Aevin's and everybody loved it.'

She added: 'Her hair has definitely had an impact on the community.

'She made her decision when wearing your hair natural was considered unattractive in the black community.

'But, against all that, she started wearing her hair natural years ago. I am really proud.'
