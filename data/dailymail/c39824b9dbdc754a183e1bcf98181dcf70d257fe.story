Sleeping peacefully in her tiny tutu, eight-day-old Marni McCarthy is cradled by her soldier father Kevin two days before he was sent to serve in Afghanistan.

The picture of Lance Corporal McCarthy, 29, of 1 Mercian Regiment, with his daughter was the winning entry in a competition to find images that capture the special bond between the Armed Forces and their families.

The best pictures feature in a calendar available from the charity My Daddy is a Soldier Adventures, which supports service families.

Winner: This picture of L/Cpl Kevin McCarthy with his daughter Marni, just eight days old at the time, has won a competition run by charity My Daddy is a Soldier Adventures

Emotion: The image for July shows one-day-old Jack Butlin with his father, who was about to go to Afghanistan

Adorable: One-year-old Isabella Veringa, who lives in Germany, is featured on the August page

The cover is of Charlotte Whittaker, four, whose family is based at Weeton Barracks, Lancashire. It also features two-day-old Jack Butlin and his father, a Royal Logistics Corps corporal; and Isabella Veringa, seen nestled in her father's pack.

My Daddy is a Soldier Adventures received thousands of photos when it ran the competition.

Louise Fetigan, the charity's co-founder and a former soldier, said: 'The gorgeous photo of Kevin and Marni was a clear winner because it encapsulates that special bond between a soldier and their child.

'We've had dozens of other photos that we couldn't leave out.

'From families as far as Germany and Cyprus, we have been inundated with entries and we can't wait for soldiers to see what photos have made it onto our calendar and Christmas cards.'

Reunion: Scarlett Hughes, two, hugs her father as she sees him for the first time after his return from Afghanistan

Cheeky: Leo Niblett dressed up in military face paint with a camouflage backpack

Siblings: Ella, Aimee and Ethan Barton issuing a heartfelt appeal while their father was serving abroad

Happy: Nieve Brignull laughs along with her father dressed in a military cap

L/Cpl McCarthy's wife Stephanie said: 'We were over the moon. I can't express how grateful I am that they picked my lovely family for the calendar, first place is beyond all expectations I had when I sent my picture to the competition

'My husband has served for 10 years and has been on five operational tours, once to Northern Ireland, twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan.

'We were married before he joined so have muddled through together on these tours - or rather, apart.

Stylish: Charlotte Whittaker, aged four, is featured on the front cover of the calendar

Pointing: Harley Kincaid, in a 'Little Trooper' hoodie, sitting in the arms of his father

Please come home: Lailah Pagdin, aged two and a half, cuddles up with pictures of her father

'Finally in September 2012 we were blessed with our beautiful daughter Marni, but with an impending tour of Afghanistan which has been one of the most emotional and heart-wrenching of them.

'Luckily we have great family and friends around us and the support of our welfare office and charities such as My Daddy is a Soldier Adventures.'

The calendar features a total of 13 images, one for each month and another on the front cover, while 17 more photographs are on the back cover.

February's photograph shows two year-old Harley Kinciad being held by his father in combat uniform. Harley, two, wears his 'Little Trooper' hoodie with pride, in an image that won third place in the competition.

Support: Four-year-old Aaron Taylor with his soldier father Greig apparently on his shoulders

Crossing off the days: Xenia Daniel-Collings, four, with a calendar recording when her father will return

Drawing: A picture by five-year-old Blake Bingham showing him talking on the phone with his father

April's photo shows one-year-old Leo Niblett, one, of Leeming, North Yorkshire, getting up to mischief with his face covered in army warpaint.

July's image shows Jack Butlin, just two days old when the picture was taken, saying goodbye to his father as he was deployed to Afghanistan.

My Daddy is a Soldier Adventures supports children across the globe whose soldier parents are often away for long periods of time.

Calendars and Christmas cards are available at www.mydaddyisasoldieradventures.org priced at £9.99 and £3.50, with all proceeds going to support Army families.
