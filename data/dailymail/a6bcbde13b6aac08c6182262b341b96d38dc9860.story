Chiara de Blasio blew kisses and waived a rainbow flag as she marched with her parents in New York's Gay Pride parade on Sunday, decked out in a bejeweled bra and daisy dukes.

Dad Bill de Blasio wore a colorful rainbow tie over a purple shirt as he made the trek down to Greenwich Village in his first parade as mayor.

Chiara, a college student, has made several public appearances since her father was inducted as mayor last January, and has been very open about her past drug abuse.

Personal connection: The parade has special significance to de Blasio's wife Chirlane McCray, who came out as a lesbian in 1979 and dated mostly women until she met her future husband working for former-mayor David Dinkins

New York's first daughter unexpectedly
 released a video in December 2013, revealing how she overcame her 
depression and addiction to marijuana to help out her father in his 
campaign for office.

Yesterday's
 parade is of special significance to wife Chirlane McCray, who came out
 as a lesbian in 1979. Mrs McCray dated women for most of her adult life
 before meeting her future husband working for former-mayor David 
Dinkins.

The New York parade
 is just one of several marches across that happened across the country 
on Sunday, as the U.S. celebrates  gay pride month.

The
 festivities hit the west coast of the U.S. late Sunday. In San 
Francisco, revelers celebrated in the cities' 44th parade, which 
included marchers raising awareness for the plight of Chelsea Manning, 
who was named honorary grand marshal of the parade for the second year 
in a row.

Manning
 is currently in U.S. prison, convicted of charges related to her 
leaking classified information on WikiLeaks. In August 2013, Manning, 
who was before known as Bradley Manning, officially confirmed that she 
was a woman named Chelsea.

'Generations of Pride', honoring civil rights battles in tandem with a 
celebration for Seattle electing it's first openly gay mayor last 
November.

In the U.S., rainbow flags lined the streets of New York City's Fifth Avenue. In addition to Mayor de Blasio, other politicians joined in the parade including Gov Andrew Cuomo.

March participants wore an array of colorful costumes, many of which included rainbow items and accessories.

This year, Laverne Cox of hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black, Jonathan Groff of HBO series Looking, and Rea Carey, Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, served as Grand Marshals in New York.

Boy Scouts, along with a chapter of Scouts for Equality, also appeared in the march.

The march was broadcast live on YouTube, under the name #Pridecast.

Over 1 million attendees were expected in New York, CBS2 reported.

Marchers are commemorating the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn riots that took place in June 1969, which are credited with launching the modern gay rights movement.

In Chicago, as many as 1 million people were expected to pack the streets of the city's North Side for the first gay pride parade since Illinois legalized gay marriage last month.

Charlie Gurion, who with David Wilk in February became the first couple in Cook County to get a same-sex marriage license, said there was a different feel to the parade this year.

'I think there is definitely like an even more sense of pride now knowing that in Illinois you can legally get married now,' Gurion said, as he posed for photograph after photograph with Wilk at the parade. 'I think it is a huge thing and everybody's over the moon that they can do it now.'

From the East Coast to the Midwest and the Pacific, seven more states legalized same-sex marriage, boosting the total to 19, plus Washington, D.C. The Obama administration moved vigorously to extend federal benefits to married gay couples. And in 17 consecutive court decisions, federal and state judges have upheld the right of gays to marry. Not a single ruling has gone the other way.

In addition to the parades in larger cities, humbler celebrations were being held in smaller towns and cities such as Augusta, Georgia, and Floyd, Virginia, while festivals were held Saturday in France, Spain, Mexico and Peru.

Among the marchers Sunday in New York were cousins Yaseena Oatis, 20, and Shayna Melendez, 22, from Plainfield, New Jersey.

'We're walking to celebrate, to be embraced being who we are around people who are like us, free to express ourselves,' Oatis said. 'Everybody has a different story about how they came out as gay, but we're all here.'
