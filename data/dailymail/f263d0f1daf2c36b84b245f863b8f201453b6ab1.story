A teenager who survived being shot by Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik told his trial that she heard him 'scream a battle cry' as he rampaged around a cafe building shooting dead 13 people.

Ingvild Stensrud, 17, who was shot in the leg and shoulder, said she sought refuge in the summer camp's cafe on the island of Utoya, hiding behind a piano, only to get trapped as Breivik walked from room to room in the small building, killing more than a dozen people.        

She said she only survived because another victim fell on her, knocking her to the floor and giving the impression she was dead.

On trial: Witness and victim Glenn Martin Waldenstroem said Breivik (pictured in court today) appeared both joyous and angry as he fired shots in the cafe building on the island of Utoya

Speaking at the trial in Oslo today she said she initially thought Breivik was not alone as he rampaged around the island dressed as a police officer shooting dead dozens of people.

'I thought they (the attackers) were exchanging messages but realising he was alone, I think the scream was actually a battle cry,' she testified. Breivik made sure his victims were dead by delivering a control shot to their heads one by one, she added. 

Speaking about her ordeal, she said: 'I tried to get to the door behind others and when they got shot, they fell on me. One laid across my chest.

'That's when I got hit in the left thigh. Many were shot lying on the floor.'  

'Next to me (a man) was coughing up blood,' she added.          

That person, Glenn Martin Waldenstroem, said Breivik appeared both joyous and angry as he fired shots.      

'His face looked distorted,' said Waldenstroem, 20, who survived being shot in the face.

'He looked angry and smiled simultaneously,' he added, after asking the court to escort Breivik out of the room, saying he was unable to testify with him present.            

When rescued, Waldenstroem could not speak and wrote his relatives' phone number down on the floor with blood so they could be notified he was alive.   

Breivik has said he initially tried to call an end to his killing spree after leaving the cafe, picking up a victim's mobile and phoning police, only to be forced to leave a message.

He continued killing, shouting 'you are going to die today, Marxists,' ignoring pleas of mercy from people begging for their lives.      

The evidence emerged after a day high drama at the courthouse yesterday where an unknown man set himself on fire outside the building.

After dousing himself in a flammable liquid, the burning man ran towards the entrance.

Police officers rushed to his aid, pulling his burning jumper off before attempting to put the fire out.

Police said the man was a Norwegian citizen and had serious wounds to his chest and stomach. It is not yet known if the incident is connected to the trial although police believe it could be.

On Tuesday, Ina Rangones Libak told the court she remembered all the shots that hit her, in the arm, the jaw and then the chest.

The 22-year-old said when she was shot in the chest she thought it would kill her.

She said: 'I started to fell that I am stumbling, falling, I don't have full control over my body and I'm thinking, OK, I'm going to die. This is how it feels to die. '

She described how her friends supported her and they encouraged each other, willing each other to survive the ordeal.

Earlier this week, Marius Hoft, 19, told the court how he fled with his best friend Andreas Dalby Grønnesby as Breivik slaughtered dozens of his friends. 

They clambered over heaps of bodies in a desperate bid to find a hiding place and were finally forced to climb down the sheer side of a cliff.

But as they searched for a secure spot to wait for rescue, Andreas lost his grip and plunged to his death.

Mr Hoft told how he was forced to listen as Breivik continued his shooting spree in the woods above before the police arrived to stop him. He was then hauled to safety on a rope by rescuers.

Chilling photographs that show Mr Hoft clinging to the cliffside were released for the first time on Monday.

Breivik killed 77 people on July 22 last year, first detonating a car bomb outside government buildings in central Oslo which killed eight, and then shooting 69 people, most of them teenagers, at the ruling Labour Party's summer camp on Utoya Island.     

He admits the killings but denies criminal guilt, arguing the killings were necessary since his victims were 'traitors' who promoted Muslim immigration and multiculturalism, thereby threatening Norwegian ethnic purity.

If deemed sane, Breivik faces a 21-year jail sentence which could be indefinitely extended for as long as he is considered dangerous.        

One court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic, but a second team came to the opposite conclusion. The five judges will take a final decision on his sanity at the end of the trial.        

Breivik has said he should either be executed or acquitted, calling the prospect of a prison sentence 'pathetic'. If he were to be declared insane, he has said that would be 'worse than death'.
