Daniel Plater, 19, raped a woman in her own home before trying to 
strangle her and set fire to her clothes - because she did not respond 
to a text

A teenager beat up and raped a female friend at gunpoint in her own home because she did not reply to one of his texts.

Daniel Plater, 19, also attempted to strangle his victim and set fire to her pyjamas in an apparent revenge attack for ignoring the message.

Plater, from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, had sent the message while the 18-year old victim was out celebrating on New Year's Eve with friends.

When she did not see the text, Plater turned up at her home in Greater Manchester where he carried out the violent attack.

Plater was jailed for ten-and-a-half years after pleading guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to rape, assault and possessing an imitation firearm.

The court heard how Plater arrived at her home holding an air pistol gun saying: ‘I have a surprise for you’.

He then hit her over the head with the weapon before threatening: 'You don’t know the kind of thing I am capable of. I do not feel like letting you live.'

During the terrifying ordeal, the woman was forced to perform a sex act on Plater while he pointed the gun at her head, the court heard.

He then tried to strangle her and set fire to the bottom of her pyjamas, before she was able to escape and phone the police for help.

When police arrived, they immediately arrested Plater who was said to still be loitering outside the woman's home.

The court heard how the victim had been left ‘struggling to cope’ since the incident and was worried about Plater's release from jail.

After the case, Detective Constable Dorothy Orr, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was a terrible act that has deeply affected the victim.

'For reasons only known to Plater himself, he was jealous and attempted to control her.

'When she did not reply to his text, something inside him snapped and he decided to take his anger out in the most horrific of ways.

'Plater had clearly thought about what he was going to do by taking a gun.

'After the initial call to police, Plater was arrested and is now serving time behind bars for the violent and terrifying crime he committed on an innocent young woman.'
