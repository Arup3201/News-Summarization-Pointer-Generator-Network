Andrew Wilkie has been struck off after stealing more than £50,000 from his school to fund his online poker addiction

A headteacher has been struck off for stealing £50,000 from school funds to finance his online gambling habit.

Andrew Wilkie, 42, blew his family’s £90,000 savings and £70,000 by remortgaging the family home - then drained his primary school of funds for a new extension.

Wilkie turned to online poker while depressed and suspended from work over a child’s accusation of sexual misconduct, of which he was cleared.

Following a full police investigation, no action was taken against him - and he was allowed to return to school.

But Wilkie was hooked on internet gambling and regularly played online poker into the early hours of the morning.

After he gambled away the funds the planned extension to the school hall at Southdown Primary School in Buckley, North Wales, had to be put on hold.

Wilkie, who had already been convicted of fraud, was been struck off the teaching register indefinitely after admitting unprofessional conduct at a disciplinary hearing.

The General Teaching Council for Wales said Wilkie cannot teach in schools in England or Wales.

But he can apply to register again in two years.

Representing Wilkie Colin Adkins Mr Adkins, of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), said the decision was 'totally disproportionate'.

He said it had failed to consider that Wilkie’s gambling addiction meant he wasn’t in control of his actions.

Wilkie had admitted two theft charges with eight similar offences taken into consideration, amounting to £53,438. He had earlier been jailed for 16 months.

He said: 'The GTCW have done the professional equivalent of slapping Mr Wilkie across the face and telling him he should pull himself together.'

An earlier court hearing was told he blew the family’s £90,000 savings and £70,000 he got from re-mortgaging the family home without his wife knowing before stealing the school’s funds.

Psychologist Julia Long told the hearing had 'obsessive compulsive behaviours' that he channelled into his job.

But she said these 'became focused on his gambling' after he was suspended following the allegations which were later dropped.

Wilkie said: 'I take full responsibility. My biggest regret is that it puts in jeopardy my chances of ever working with children again in a job I know I’m good at.'

In September the government announced plans to toughen gambling laws in a bid to protect problem punters.

The Lib Dems have launched a campaign to clampdown on gambling regulations which were relaxed under the previous Labour government.

Legislation which came into force in 2007 relaxed some of the regulations surrounding gambling.

It included restrictions on betting shops, casinos and online gambling operators advertising on TV and radio.
