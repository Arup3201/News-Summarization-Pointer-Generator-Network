Eight British schoolgirls have travelled to Syria in the last seven months using a route which has become known as the 'jihadi bride trail' - and hundreds more besotted British women have proposed marriage to extremists online.

The true figure is likely to be even higher as the police and families have imposed news blackouts in some cases, prompting fears that Britain's anti-terrorism agencies are losing the battle against the radicalisation of young Muslims on the internet.

School friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase 15, from Bethnal Green Academy are reported to be in Syria after flying out of Gatwick for Turkey earlier this month. A fourth unnamed girl from the same school went out in December.

Radical websites like Jihad Matchmaker, which offers to arrange marriages between Muslim women and Jihadists, have been blamed for encouraging young, impressionable girls to travel to Syria. 

Hundreds of besotted British women have put marriage proposals to jihadists fighting on the front line with Islamic State, according to security sources.

One European fighter in Syria who has become a pin-up jihadi fighter has been bombarded with proposals from women all over the world, desperate to be associated with a 'holy warrior'.

Jihad Matchmaker, which states it is based in Syria, uses the motto ‘keep it halal and get married.’

Its official Twitter account says: ‘Jihad Matchmaker is here to link up those seeking marriage in Syria in a halal manner.'

It is not known how many jihadi brides it has matched to jihadi fighters but it has 378 followers, many of whom are young Western Muslim women.

Last year it was forced to deny it was linked to any terrorist groups after it was alleged to been responsible for helping to radicalise teenage girls in the UK.

It encourages Muslim women seeking a jihadi husband to make contact through a third party or agent who can represent the girl’s interests under Islamic law.

It also claims: 'All actions will be conducted via Shariah acceptable routes and means once agreement and compatibilities are established.' 

Gone: Yusra Hussien was aged 15 when she told her parents she was going on a school trip before leaving her home, heading to Heathrow airport and boarding a flight to Turkey in October last year

Terror twins: Salma and Zahra Halane fled Manchester in June 2014 to join the Islamic State, becoming the first known British jihadi schoolgirls to travel to Syria

The schoolgirls who fled last week followed the same route used by two 16-year-old twins from Manchester, a 15-year-old from Bristol and another 17-year-old girl from south London. All four are believed to have married Islamic State fighters after travelling to Syria via Istanbul from UK airports. 

Manchester twins Salma and Zahra Halane fled in June 2014 to join the Islamic State and are the first known British jihadi schoolgirls to travel to Syria. 

But according to reports they are now teenage widows after their jihadi fighter husbands were killed in battles with Kurdish forces or in Coalition bombing raids.

In October Yusra Hussien, 15, a GCSE A* student, from Easton, Bristol, left in October with another teenager, Samya Dirie. 

Both flew to Turkey from Heathrow in October last year before being escorted into Syria.  

Jihadi bride: Aqsa Mahmood. A lawyer for her family said they are 'full of horror and anger' that she is being allowed by Twitter to 'recruit and encourage' others to travel to Syria

In contact: Shamima Begum, 15, sent an open message (pictured) to Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who had fled to Syria from Glasgow to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013, asking her to open a private line of communication 

Zahra and Salma Halane are also extremely bright and had 28 GCSEs between them. 

They were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college. They too were said to have been radicalised over the internet.

Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success.

It is estimated that a total of 60 British women are in Syria living with the Islamic State. 

Yusra Hussien was aged 15 when she told her parents she was going on a school trip before leaving her home, heading to Heathrow airport and boarding a flight to Turkey in October last year.

The City Academy pupil and another girl, Samya Dirie, 17, from London, then made their way to territory controlled by violent extremist group Islamic State in Syria.

It was reported earlier this month that Yusra contacted some friends to say she is now married.

Friends of Yusra, now 16, have claimed that the Bristol teenager contacted them on social media to confirm she was married in Syria living with the Islamic State.

Speaking when she first went missing, Yusra's mother Safiya Hussien, 40, said: 'Please come back. I love you so much, all your brothers and sister, we miss you so much, the house is not the same since when you left.

Now the families of the four east London schoolgirls fear that their daughters have been groomed into going to Syria to become jihadi brides.
