A former milkman accused of killing schoolgirl Claire Tiltman has admitted going on 'midnight walks' armed with knives and an air pistol to find someone to attack.

Colin Ash-Smith, 46, called himself an 'animal' and said he was 'obsessed' with women, but hated them because he feared their 'power'.

He also confessed to stockpiling and carrying knives because they made him feel 'powerful' and carrying out savage knife and sex attacks on women.

Ash-Smith is on trial for stabbing Claire to death in a dark alleyway in Greenhithe, Kent, in 1993, just four days after her 16th birthday.

Jurors at Inner London Crown Court had earlier heard that he has admitted stabbing two young women in 1988 and 1995 and leaving them for dead - but they both survived.

Entering the witness box at Inner London Crown Court for the first time, he admitted to trying to murder and sexually assaulting a young mother near a quarry in 1988.

He said: 'By that time I regularly went out about once or twice a week in the early hours of the morning.

'I would wait for my mum and dad to go to sleep first and then I would go out. I was 19 or 20.

'That was the first time I started doing it, in 1988. I used to do it quite regularly. I used to call them my midnight walks.

'I was hoping I would see someone and provoke someone into attacking me.'

He said he never set out to rape and try to kill a woman. But jurors heard that once he found his victim he subjected her to attack and 'humiliation' by taking photos of her in sexual poses.

Asked why he attacked the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, he said: 'I wanted to feel empowered, that I had control over someone. That I wasn't a doormat.'

Ash-Smith obsessively wrote down his 'successful' attacks and his other plots in diaries he called his 'Assault Plans'.

And he gave his attacks percentage marks to score his performance.

He described the attack in 1988 as '95 per cent successful' and his 'masterpiece'.

Asked why he carried out the attack, he told the court: 'I can't remember exactly, but the way I used to be, I would probably say there is no-one to stop me.

'I had a very limited moral compass.'

Describing how he feels looking back at that attack, he told jurors: 'I always thought I would protect women, would protect people, wouldn't harm people, but I failed miserably, to be honest. The one chance I got to show restraint and wouldn't do anything and walk away, and I failed miserably.

'Before that I thought I was a reasonably good person. But, to be honest, I was an animal.'

Ash-Smith denies murder and the trial continues.
