A father who snatched his daughter and took her to Pakistan before being jailed for refusing to say where she was is set to make a fresh bid for freedom.

Razwan Ali Anjum is expected to appeal his prison sentence at the High Court - just days after Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson was finally brought back to Britain three years after her abduction.

Atiya's mother, Gemma Wilkinson, is said to be 'terrified' about her former partner's potential early release.

Return: Atiya, now six, was brought back to her mother this Christmas - three years after she was taken

Razwan, 28, a former insurance salesman, has been behind bars at Forest Bank prison in Salford since 2009.

He was repeatedly jailed for contempt of court for refusing to reveal - and sometimes lying about - his daughter's whereabouts.

But it is understood he is now set to lodge a fresh appeal for freedom - and could even claim he helped to find his daughter.

Gemma, who has gone into hiding, fears he could try to snatch Atiya again if he is freed.

A source close to the family said: 
'She's absolutely terrified of him, that he will do something else when 
he gets out. He's a manipulative, cold-hearted charlatan. He knew from 
day one where Atiya was but refused to say.'

The child, now six, disappeared from her home in Ashton-under-Lyne in November 2009. She had gone to stay with her father on her third birthday - but never came back.

Razwan said he was taking her to Southport. Instead, he took her to his native Pakistan - and then came back alone to tell Gemma she was never going to see her daughter again.

Tragic: Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson has spent three years in Pakistan after she was abducted by her father - former insurance salesman Razwan Ali Anjum

Atiya and Gemma were finally reunited at Manchester Airport on Friday after the little girl was discovered in a village in the Punjab region on Christmas Eve.

Gemma, 32, was found in a village near Sialkot after the latest in a string of public appeals to trace Atiya. The appeal pricked the conscience of one of her uncles, who defied other family members and revealed to the Pakistan authorities the area where she was living.

The village and house were located and Atiya was taken back and put on a flight to Manchester. There she enjoyed a tearful re-union with her mum.

Gemma's lawyers are expecting Razwan to take his appeal to the High Court in London after January 14, where he will urge a judge to free him immediately as his daughter has now been located. He is due to be released in April.

Lawyers believe he will argue he should be freed early as his family alerted the authorities in Pakistan about the area in which Atiya was being kept. Razwan has made numerous previous appeals to be released - arguing he has helped the authorities where possible - but all have been dismissed.

Even if a judge rules the stated grounds for his early release are bogus, Gemma fears he could still be released as he has served so long behind bars.

Her lawyer Matthew Lord, of Pluck Andrew solicitors in Hyde, said: 'He's done absolutely nothing to assist in the recovery of his daughter and, so far as I'm concerned, he's done nothing to right the contempt of court he's been in prison for over the last three years.'

Mr Lord also dismissed suggestions Razwan's family would mount a custody battle for Atiya. He said:

'No applications or indications have been received that they are planning to issue court proceedings. But if they did plan to seek custody then it would only demonstrate their lack of understanding of the damage that has been caused to Atiya and other members of her close family by their actions so far.'

Gemma Wilkinson is also said to be preparing a custody challenge to return her to Pakistan.

But even as she spoke yesterday of the magical moment she gave Atiya a ‘massive cuddle’, the family of her girl’s father, Razwan Ali Anjum, 28, were preparing to get her back.

A source close to the case told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Anjum family are determined to have Atiya back, despite her father’s imprisonment. They believe they have a case and are determined to press ahead. It could all get very messy.

Furore: Gemma Wilkinson is in a secret location while spending time with her daughter

‘They were furious at being prevented from seeing her at the airport before she left Pakistan when police whisked Atiya through a VIP exit.’

Anjum was jailed for refusing to 
reveal Atiya’s whereabouts, with one judge saying it was the ‘most 
cruel’ form of abduction he had dealt with.

It
is understood Atiya was traced on Christmas Eve to the village of 
Daska, near Sialkot in the Punjab region, where she was living with 
Anjum’s relatives.

Anjum’s younger brother, Imran, flew to Pakistan the same day  and escorted the youngster on the flight home.

Describing the moment they were 
reunited, Ms Wilkinson said: ‘She looked at me and put her arms up and I
just grabbed hold of her and gave her a massive cuddle.’

Police
have been examining the circumstances of Atiya’s abduction and are 
‘considering how to take the  matter further’ now that she is home. Ms 
Wilkinson, from Manchester, had a ‘few fears’ Atiya would be unsettled 
after her ordeal, but said: ‘She is absolutely fine. She has a big 
smile, she’s happy, she’s talking. She’s home where she’s loved and 
we’ll just take it day by day.’
