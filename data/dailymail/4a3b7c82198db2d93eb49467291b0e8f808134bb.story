A gang of robbers who never left behind a single fingerprint or trace of DNA were caught after posting pictures of their loot on social media, police say.

Four men are in custody, one woman has been bailed and another four men are being hunted after police busted the alleged burglary ring, thought to be behind more than 100 crimes.

The gang from Long Beach are believed to have stolen more than $1million worth of gold bars, watches and jewelry from the Indian community, targeting them because they traditionally wear gold during religious ceremonies and cultural events.

Brothers Salvador, 24, and Ivan Ramirez, 22, are in custody and charged with leading the criminal conspiracy, along with Albaro Miranda, 24, and Juan Guerro, 22.

Teresa Ramirez, 57, has been bailed while police are still seeking Marco Coronel, 21, Aaron Flores, 20, Marco Gonzalez, 20, and Juan Carlos Olague, 22.

Starting in February 2013, the gang are said to have committed and average of two burglaries a week before being caught.

A spokesman for Ventura Police said: 
The group targeted members of the Indian community by searching the 
internet for open-source information to identify families with common 
Indian surnames.

Gonzalez Marco, 20, currently has a warrant out for his arrest after police busted an alleged burglary ring

'Once identified, they would scout specific locations before breaking into the victims’ homes.

'The suspects used pre-paid mobile phones to call the victims’ residences prior to breaking in to ensure nobody was at home.

'The suspects also drove newer vehicles and dressed nicely to avoid raising suspicion among the victims’ neighbors.

Gloves were used during the raids, and Gary Pentis from Ventura County Sheriff's Department said he couldn't recall seeing a single fingerprint or trace of DNA being left at any crime scenes.

But online, the accused were posting pictures of themselves wearing expensive watches, posing next to gold bars and holding stacks of dollar bills, which police used to track them down.

The thefts took place in Orange, L.A., San Bernardino and Ventura counties and in parts of Northern California and Nevada.

According
 to NBC Los Angeles, sheriffs are hoping the suspects can be prosecuted 
in several precincts meaning consecutive prison sentences of more than 
ten years.

The
 Long Beach gang is known for robberies, drive-by shootings and murder, 
according to Abel Morales of the Long Beach Police Department, who 
declined to name the gang to avoid giving them notoriety.

There is an arrest warrant out for Aaron Flores, 20 (left), while Juan Carlos Olague, 22 (right), is wanted by officers. Police say the gang began their raids in February 2013 and carried out an average of two a week

Police say the gang hit homes across California and into Nevada. When scouting out neighbourhoods, they worse expensive clothes and drove nice cars so as not to stand out
