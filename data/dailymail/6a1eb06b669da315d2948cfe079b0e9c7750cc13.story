Newsagent Jarrett Rivers will tell his mum to keep a copy of every newspaper from the shop in which they work after he stole the headlines and sent non-league Blyth Spartans into the third round of the FA Cup.

The 21-year-old spent Friday stacking shelves but he had more energy than anyone in the last minute at Victoria Park as he jinked into the area and fired home.

Rivers soon disappeared beneath a pile of green-and-white team-mates and supporters who spilled on to the pitch in celebration.

And the Blyth hero - who wants Manchester United in Monday's draw - said: ‘I don't need to buy every paper because my mum gets them in and I’ll be telling her to keep every one of them.

‘It is unbelievable. The club got to the fifth round in 1978 and the third round a few years ago, so this is an unbelievable achievement. 

'It is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It is unreal.

‘As soon as I got the ball I knew what I wanted to do and I like running at people. 

'As soon as it went in I can't describe the feeling. But I couldn't breathe in that pile I was under.'

The seventh-tier outfit drew level when engineering student Stephen Turnbull - a player deemed not good enough for Hartlepool and who once caused Bury to be thrown out of the FA Cup – cancelled out Jonathan Franks’ headed opener with a delightful free-kick on 56 minutes.

Turnbull played 25 times for Pools between 2004 and 2008 and, during a loan spell at Bury, he appeared in a second round replay despite being ineligible and the club were duly expelled from the competition.

But he penned a far more favourable piece of FA Cup history on Friday night as his 25-yard effort made it 1-1.

The headlines, though, belonged to the newsagent.
