Alan Gross, the contractor freed
last week after five years in a Cuban jail, will receive $3.2million from the US government as part of a compensation package, it was announced yesterday.

Gross was arrested in Cuba in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine Internet service for Cuban Jews.

Yesterday the US Agency for International Development (USAID) claimed it had reached the settlement with his former employer DAI - which said it was 'delighted to have Alan home and pleased to have this legal matter settled'.

'Our understanding is that the money will go to Alan Gross as part of an agreement between the two parties,' the USAID spokesman said. The money would be paid in the next few days, he added.

Gross, 65, a foreign aid subcontractor, was delivering electronics to Jewish groups when he was arrested in Havana in December 2009.

The United States says Gross was merely helping Cubans get connected as part of a democracy-building project. 

Initially accused of espionage, he was put on trial by Havana in 2011 and convicted of committing 'acts against the independence and territorial integrity' of Cuba.

He was released in a series of surprise moves last week that saw the United States announce that it would end 50 years of estrangement and normalize relations with Cuba.

Gross arrived in Washington on a US military aircraft last Wednesday, accompanied by several US politicians.

The $3.2million payout came as a settlement of a larger contractual claim for $7 million filed by DAI against USAID for expenses related to the arrest and incarceration of Gross.

The settlement was finalized on Monday.

'The settlement avoids the cost, delay and risks of further proceedings, and does not constitute an admission of liability by either party,' USAID said in a statement.

At the time of his arrest, Gross was allegedly in possession of an electronic chip that prevents the location of satellite telephone calls to be traced. 

A specialist in satellite communications, he visited Cuba several times, delivering computer and satellite gear to the island nation's small Jewish community.

Gross and his wife Judy filed a $60 million lawsuit in
November 2012 for gross negligence against DAI and the U.S.
government. 

He settled with DAI for undisclosed terms in May
2013, and a US district court rejected his claim against the
government, which was upheld last month on appeal.

A lawyer for Gross declined to discuss the settlement but
added that it was planning to seek a review by the Supreme Court
of its case against the U.S. government.

Gross was employed by Bethesda, Maryland-based DAI as part of a USAID financed project.

Gross was a longtime supporter of Jewish causes and a career development consultant who traveled the world on private contracts before taking his Cuba assignment. He had only once previously visited Cuba and spoke very limited Spanish.

Gross worked for Maryland-based Development Alternatives Inc (DAI), which had a $6 million deal with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to promote democracy and support political dissidents. Gross signed two contracts with DAI paying him a total of $590,000 to deliver telecommunications equipment over 20 months.

During five trips to Cuba in 2009, Gross imported banned satellite communications devices and other high-tech gear in his luggage and helped install it at Jewish centers in Havana, Santiago and Camaguey.

Cuban officials arrested him in his hotel room on Dec. 3, 2009, just before he had planned to return home.

Gross sued DAI and the U.S. government for $60 million, saying he was inadequately informed of the dangers and illegality of his mission. He settled with DAI for an undisclosed sum and a judge threw out his suit against the United States, a decision upheld on appeal.

While incarcerated, Gross morphed from a gadget geek to an embittered critic of the U.S. and Cuban governments. 

He lost 100 pounds from his original 254 pounds. His spirits dimmed after his mother died of cancer in June, and he stopped seeing doctors, his wife, or officials of the U.S. interests section shortly thereafter. 

The day before his release, Barack Obama and Cuban strongman Raul Castro spoke on the phone for 45 minutes to cement what became a prisoner swap.

It was the first such contact between the countries' heads of state since the middle of the 20th century.

'I was very insistent with him that we would continue to promote democracy and human rights and speak out forcefully on behalf of the freedom of the people of Cuba,' Obama told ABC News in a post-announcement interview that aired Wednesday night.

During a 15-minute television address hours earlier, he pledged to 'end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,'

'Todos somos Americanos,' Obama said – 'We are all Americans' – emphasizing his wish that Cuba should be mainstreamed among its North and South American neighbors. 

The historic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuban relations began in spring 2013, when President Barack Obama authorized secret talks with Havana, the same tactic he used to open nuclear negotiations with Iran.

Months of talks in Canada and at the Vatican, involving one of Obama's closest aides, culminated on Tuesday when Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro spoke by phone for nearly an hour and gave final assent to steps that could end a half-century of enmity and reshape Western Hemisphere relations.

Obama believed that 'if there is any U.S. foreign policy that has passed its expiration date, it is the U.S.-Cuba policy,' said a senior Obama administration official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity.

The Vatican played a key role in the rapprochement, including facilitating talks on the release of Alan Gross, a former subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development who returned from Cuba on Wednesday after five years' imprisonment, U.S. officials said.

In early summer 2014, Pope Francis - who is from Argentina - sent separate personal letters to Obama and Castro, urging them to exchange captives and improve relations.

When the pope received the U.S. president in Vatican City in late March, the secret Cubatalks were a central topic of discussion. Cuba 'got as much attention as anything else,' the official said.

The first face-to-face talks that eventually led to this week's deal took place in June 2013 in Canada, which has long maintained relations with Cuba.

Leading the U.S. delegation were Ben Rhodes, a close Obama aide who is a deputy national security adviser, and Ricardo Zuniga, the top Latin American specialist on the White House's National Security Council. The names of the Cuban participants in the talks could not immediately be learned.

U.S. and Cuban prisoners were a major point of debate, the officials said.

For the Obama administration, Gross' continued imprisonment was both a practical and political barrier to improved ties.

Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone four times this summer with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez about Gross, a second senior U.S. official said.

Kerry told the Cubans that if anything happened to Gross, there would never be better relations between Washington and Havana, this official said.
