Britain's ‘tiny’ role in the global fight against Islamic State terrorists will be condemned by MPs today.

Just two days after the sickening video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive emerged, the Defence Select Committee will blast Britain’s contribution in the fight against the terror group as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘deeply concerning’.

The UK has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against Islamist jihadists – amounting to less than one a day, the committee’s report will reveal.

Criticism: The Defence Select Committee will blast Britain’s contribution in the fight against ISIS - just two days after the sickening video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive, pictured, emerged

There were only three UK military personnel outside the Kurdish regions of Iraq, compared with 400 Australians, 280 Italians and 300 Spanish, when the MPs visited Iraq before Christmas.

This is despite David Cameron claiming that defeating IS – also known as Daesh and Isil – was a ‘priority’ for Britain. In December last year, he said: ‘We must, with our allies, use everything in our power to defeat it. That means combating terrorism. It means defeating Isil in Iraq and Syria.’

But the report says it is ‘very surprising that the UK Government is doing so little’, given the rise of Islamic State has proven the ‘sum of all our fears’.

‘Given that Daesh is the most dramatic and significant threat to regional stability and international security to have emerged in the Middle East in decades, we are surprised and deeply concerned that the UK is not doing more,’ it will say.

The criticisms come after the Daily Mail revealed the Government had delayed a decision to send hundreds of troops to train Iraqi forces for fear of casualties in the run-up to the general election.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon had announced last year that the soldiers would be deployed to the region in January. But despite calls by the Iraqis for help, it is understood there are only 48 UK personnel carrying out training there. In addition, there are around 400 UK personnel operating eight Tornado jets, a Rivet Joint spy plane and other UK resources – though most of those are not based in Iraq.

Committee chairman Rory Stewart MP said: ‘Daesh controls territory equivalent to the size of the UK, has contributed to the displacement of millions, destabilising and threatening neighbouring states, and providing a safe haven to an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters – many dedicated to an international terrorist campaign.

‘Yet the role that the UK is playing in combating it is strikingly modest.’

If Britain does not properly respond to the ‘threat and horrors represented by Daesh’, there will be political ramifications.

It would ‘heighten perceptions’ that the UK has ‘stepped back from its international role’ and could risk undermining wider commitment to the US-led coalition.

The report adds: ‘It would undermine the UK’s national security interests through destabilisation of the region and through Daesh’s sponsorship of terrorist attacks and training of British foreign fighters in military tactics, which could be used upon the UK public following their return home.’

The MPs said there was a ‘significant gap’ between the rhetoric of Britain and its partners and the reality of the campaign on the ground. While the politicians did not call for combat troops on the ground, they said the UK should increase its support from the air and meet the request from the Iraqi army to provide training in counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) skills.

Mr Stewart said the UK should deploy Special Forces and far more people in intelligence, planning and regional politics.

He added: ‘We must clearly acknowledge the previous failures in Iraq, and reform our approach. But that does not mean lurching to doing nothing. The UK should find a way of engaging with Iraq that is moderate, pragmatic, but energetic.

‘There are dozens of things the UK could be doing, without deploying combat troops, to work with coalition partners to help address one of the most extreme threats that we have faced in the last 20 years.’

Only the deployment of a few hundred personnel would be required, the cost would be relatively modest, and it would not entail the risks inherent in deploying UK troops in combat roles, he said.

Another criticism raised in the report, titled The situation in Iraq and Syria and the response to Daesh, is how the Chiefs of Staff are unable or unwilling to provide a ‘clear and articulate’ statement of the UK’s objectives or strategic plan.

There was a lack of clarity over who owns a policy – and indeed whether such a policy exists, they found. And despite the UK’s long involvement in Iraq, there were no UK personnel on the ground with deep expertise in the region.

It was ‘unacceptable’ for the UK to ‘simply sign up’ to providing military support for the campaign without any assessment, detail or viability of the campaign plan.

David Cameron yesterday insisted during Prime Minister’s Questions he will fight to eradicate IS. Referring to the latest IS video, he said: ‘I can assure the House that we will not stop until the murderous Isil extremists behind this and their poisonous ideology are eradicated.’
