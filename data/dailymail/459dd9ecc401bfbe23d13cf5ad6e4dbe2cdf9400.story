Students in China are reportedly being forced to assemble Sony's forthcoming Playstation 4 or risk failing their course.

IT engineering students at China's Xi'an Institute of Technology claim they were made to glue parts of the console together in factory conditions in order to earn course credits.

Chinese media say students were given unpaid 'internships' at the world's largest electronics manufacturer,  Foxconn, but were given manual work instead of tasks directly related to their studies.

Jobs at the company's Yantai plant included peeling off the protective plastic from the console and putting stickers on it, according to reports.

Other students were involved in distribution and shipping.

Even more menial roles included putting the instruction manual into the boxes, Games In India reported.

If the jobs were refused the students lost six credits and therefore jeopardised their chance of graduation.

Foxconn said it has launched an internal investigation after finding a 'few instances' where students worked work nights and overtime.

The company said the internships give students the opportunity to gain practical work experience and training.

A spokeswoman told Mail Online: 'All participating schools are required to follow specific policies established by Foxconn for this program including assurances that participation is voluntary, interns are free to terminate their internship at any time they choose, and interns are not allowed to take part in overtime work or work night shifts.   

'In the case of recent allegations regarding the Internship Program at our Yantai campus, we have conducted an internal investigation and have determined that there have been a few instances where our policies pertaining to overtime and night shift work were not enforced.

'Immediate actions have been taken to bring that campus into full compliance with our code and policies.'

Mail Online has contacted Sony but no one was immediately available for comment.

It is not the first time Foxconn has been accused of poor working practices.

Hundreds of workers rioted at a Foxconn plant in Chengdu, southwest China, last year over perceived long hours and low pay.

Foxconn, which employs about one million people, makes many of the world's most popular gadgets, including Apple's iPhone and iPad, the Amazon Kindle and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles.
