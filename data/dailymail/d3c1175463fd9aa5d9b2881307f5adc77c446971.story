Yearning: Tracey Emin never had children because art comes first

Tracey Emin never had children because her desire to be a successful artist overrode any maternal feelings.

In an interview for today’s You magazine, Emin, 49, best known for My Bed – featuring bed linen stained with bodily secretions – tells Liz Jones she would have resented having to leave her  studio to look after children.

Emin, who had an abortion at he age of 26 and has never married, said: ‘It’s not because I didn’t meet anyone; if I wanted to have a baby, I could’ve.

‘I didn’t want to because the creative yearning and wanting  to be an artist far overrode the physical feelings of wanting to be a mother. The mother who is the CEO of the company or whatever can’t wait to get home and see  her children.

‘The mother who’s in the studio painting will resent going home to her children.’

The multi-millionaire artist, who has homes in London and St Tropez, added: ‘When people have children, they have a sense of purpose.

‘When you don’t have children you have to define and make your own purpose, and make your own reason for being here.

‘I’d like to think I inspire young people to be creative.’

Emin also admitted she worried about growing old. ‘I’m nearly 50 and that’s where I am,’ she said.

‘I know I’m supposed to say ageing doesn’t bother me, then suddenly you’re like, “Yeah, I care about it, I really worry about it. I’m getting old. I’m old!” ’

Emin, who made her name as one of the original Young British Artists with the likes of Damien Hirst in the Nineties, said she wanted to carry on working for as long as possible and is trying to curb her drinking to stop her brain turning into ‘mush’.

She said: ‘I feel physically ill if I don’t make work, I don’t create .  .  .

‘Hopefully the last bit of me to go will be my brain.

Memorable: One of the artist's most famous pieces is My Bed, an installation featuring bed linen stained with bodily secretions

‘For the future, drinking is a big question mark.

‘It’s not being holier than thou, it’s that I know what I’d rather be doing when I’m 95.

‘And it would be so stupid not to be able to do that because my brain had gone to mush.’

Emin also revealed that she will leave her estate to animal charities, a children’s library she set up in Uganda and Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust.

From wild Young British Artist to Royal Academician, Tracey Emin has evoked acclaim and controversy for nearly two decades. Britain's most provocative artist opens up to Britain's most controversial columnist...

I'm in Tracey Emin’s Spitalfields studio. It’s so big, on four floors, you could park an aeroplane in here, yet it’s full to the rafters with works of art in wooden crates, canvases in floor-to-ceiling cubbyholes, a huge desk covered in neat rows of tubes of oil paint (and I thought she’d be messy).

There are two works in progress: sculptures of her beloved cat Docket, asleep in the shape of a comma. It’s so very much a cat, you feel you want to stroke it.

One day, 100 years from now, I say, as Tracey appears, all honed thighs and knee boots, a jaunty scarf over a jumper, hair expensively dyed and in a neat ponytail (she eschewed our offer of hair, make-up and stylist), this will all be preserved in aspic.

There’s enough here to fill a museum. Does she worry she’s producing too much?

‘Doesn’t happen. When Edvard Munch died he had over 2,000 drawings, 500 paintings and 1,000 watercolours in his house.’

Does she work all the time? ‘I can sit here and sew while talking to you, but that’s not work, it’s production. Me working is me experimenting, me trying something new, me doing something badly but seeing something good in it, having time to open stuff up and reinvent things.’

Does she feel guilty if she isn’t working, could quickly become out of practice, maybe? ‘I feel physically ill if I don’t make work, I don’t create. I don’t feel very good, I don’t feel right, I feel wrong.’ She sounds a perfectionist, disciplined.

‘Sometimes magic things happen; it’s just something within the process. I don’t like it when the drawings get too neat. It looks like a machine’s done them, so it’s no good, it’s got to be real, you know? I’m disciplined in the fact that I get everything done but I’m prone to change my mind on things.

‘I’ve planned my death, what happens afterwards. As an artist you have to, otherwise what would happen? It would just be such a mess, wouldn’t it?

'One thing about an artist, it doesn’t matter how much your work sells for in your life, it’s going to sell for ten times more than that after you’re dead, and that’s what you have to protect.’

'I wouldn’t want to be really thin now. I don’t not eat, but I do exercise and I watch more what I eat and I try not to drink as much now [she’s had some famously drunken episodes in the past]; I never drink at home alone any more’

It’s a gruesome contradiction, talking about what will happen after her death, when we are meant to be discussing her new book, My Photo Album, which is largely about her childhood and teenage years, before she found success as a conceptual, confrontational artist.

It’s a wonderful, evocative edit from a personal stash of 10,000 photos. Can she see she was destined for great things in those early snapshots?

Philanthropist: Tracey will leave all her estate to a variety of charities

‘I was brought up with a lot of love from my mum and dad. Being wilful meant I had an idea of what was wrong and what was right for me.

'I spent quite a lot of time alone as a child, too, so I think I was always introspective. And even when I was little, I liked creating things. I used to make doll’s houses out of cardboard boxes.’

She must like looking at herself, I venture; much of her art consists of her own body, photographed, drawn or painted. (She works in many different media: at the moment, watercolour.)

Not vain, exactly, but self-obsessed. Did she realise she was, is, beautiful? ‘I never realised what I looked like and I wish I had; I would have made much more of it.

'I’ve always had a thing about my body, always not felt good about it. The happiest I am is the thinnest I can be. I think the less of me there is the better I feel about it.

'It’s a thing you shouldn’t really say, but that’s the truth, that made me feel good. I was super-fit as well, rode a bike everywhere, swam a kilometre every day… You’re not going to be fat if you do that, and also I was never a big eater.’

And now? ‘Not now. I wouldn’t want to be really thin now. I don’t not eat, but I do exercise and I watch more what I eat and I try not to drink as much now [she’s had some famously drunken episodes in the past]; I never drink at home alone any more.’
