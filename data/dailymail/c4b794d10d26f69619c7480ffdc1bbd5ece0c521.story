 A week-old nearly frozen panther kitten was rescued from a wildlife refuge in southwest Florida in mid-January, and biologists say the tiny feline would have died if researchers hadn't discovered him.

Officials from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said that the abandoned kitten was found at the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge in Collier County.

The adorable male kitten weighed one pound, had hypothermia, and wasn't responsive. The wildlife refuge center has documented the kitten's healing process in heartwarming photographs and on film.

'We want to give any panther kitten the best opportunity to survive in the wild,'posited FWC veterinarian Dr. Mark Cunningham in a press release.

'But clearly this kitten was in poor condition and almost certainly would have died without intervention.'

Veterinarians at a Naples animal hospital performed life-saving measures and gave the kitten 24-hour care, reports the Science Recorder.

When the kitten was strong enough, he was brought to Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa. Eventually he will be taken to a fenced wildlife park in Homosassa Springs.

He adorably plays with stuffed animals as if they were his panther mates, drinks from a baby bottle, and smiles lovingly.

so far he's gained more than a pound.

According to a statement by the zoo, this is the fourth kitten and eight panther to receive rehabilitation at the wildlife center.

The little panther doesn't have a mother so he will have to learn from humans how to survive

Biologists say that because the kitten didn't learn survival skills from his mother, he won't be released into the wild.

When the kitten is healthy again it will be taken to the Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park where visitors will be able to observe him in his natural habitat.

The National Wildlife Federations reports that less than 100 Florida panthers remain in the wild.

They live in southern Florida in swamplands like the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve.

Because there are so few of these felines in the wild, the species as a whole is threatened by anything from feline disease, car crashes, and habitat loss.
