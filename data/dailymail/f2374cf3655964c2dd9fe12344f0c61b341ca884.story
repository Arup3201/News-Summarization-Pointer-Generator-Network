A woman accused of brutally slashing and shooting her one-time boyfriend to death in his shower months after they broke up could be put to death for the heinous crime.

Prosecutors in Arizona began arguing today that 32-year-old Jodi Arias should receive the death penalty for the murder of her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was killed in June 2008.

Alexander, a 30-year-old Mormon motivational speaker, was found stabbed 27 times, with his throat slit and with a bullet in his head at his home in Mesa, Arizona days after the savage attack.

'This is not a case of whodunit. The person who did this killing sits in court today and it is the defendant Jodi Ann Arias,' prosecutor Juan Martinez told the Arizona courtroom on Wednesday.

Arias, a photographer who had dated Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, has been in jail since her arrest. She has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder.

But investigators and Alexander's 
friends maintain that Arias became bitterly jealous and 'obsessed' with 
him after the break up, and even stalked him in the months leading up to
 his death.

The prosecution is arguing that Arias
 killed her ex-boyfriend after finding out that he had moved on and 
planned to take his new girlfriend on a trip to Mexico.

'This love, well she rewarded that 
love for Travis Victor Alexander by sticking a knife in his chest. And 
he was a good man, well she slit his throat as a reward for being a good
 man,' Mr Martinez said.

The defense is painting an entirely 
different picture of Alexander, saying that his relationship with Arias 
was abusive and she killed him in self defense.

Travis Alexander and Jodi Arias were involved in a rough sexual relationship before the death of Alexander in June 2008

Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference

'Had Jodi not been forced to defend 
herself, none of us would be here. In that one minute, had Jodi not 
chosen to defend herself she would not be here,' defense attorney 
Jennifer Willmott said.

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
 in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be 
baptised into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.

In December 2007, Alexander 
began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she 
slashed the tyres on his car twice.

In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked 
into his Facebook account and told her to stay away.

Yet on June 4, she visited his home and they had sex before he was murdered. She later told police that they had maintained a secret sexual relationship despite breaking up, ABC reported.

'There's nothing about her that I see in
 marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to 
his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks 
into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.'

At first she denied being at his 
house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in 
Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex.

The water-logged camera, which belonged to
 Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted.

Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture
 showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding 
while on the floor.

The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on
 Alexander's bed at 1.40pm.

On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'.

Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing

Wounds show that Alexander attempted 
to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture 
wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek.

Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found 
in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic.

After initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her ex-boyfriend.

'I witnessed Travis being attacked by 
two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I 
don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.'

Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body

She later changed her story once 
again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after
 he became angry when she dropped his camera.

She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship.

'It makes me sick because I know her 
true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into 
this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.'

As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation.Â 

She asked to represent herself but 
when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had 
written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'.

In court: Arias has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder but prosecutors want the death penalty

Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case.

Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In Jnauary 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.

Opening statements begin today, January 2.
