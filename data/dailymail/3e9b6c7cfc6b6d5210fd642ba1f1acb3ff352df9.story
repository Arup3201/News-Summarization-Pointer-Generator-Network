A man has been arrested in relation to the theft of two of British Olympians' medals, stolen just hours after they celebrated with the Queen at a special reception at Buckingham Palace.

Rower Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod took to Twitter to report that their medals were missing after they celebrated at Mahiki Nighclub in Mayfair, central London in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Mr Partridge's Olympic blazer, which also went missing, has since been handed into a northwest London police station at 11.30am today.

Medal stolen: Alex Partridge, who won bronze at London 2012 as part of the men's eight rowing team, has had his Olympic medal and blazer stolen while celebrating in Mayfair after a reception at Buckingham Palace. His blazer has since been handed into police

A 29-year-old man is being held at a west London police station in relation to the investigation, a police spokesman said.

Mr Partridge, 31, who won bronze as part of the men’s eight rowing team, posted on Twitter yesterday: 'To the chap who took my @London2012 Olympic Blazer & Medal last night The police have u on CCTV Please return it to 6 Lower Mall Hammersmith.'

Ms Macleod, 28, who won bronze in the women’s hockey, also wrote on the social networking site: ‘My medal was also stolen at the same time. Totally devastated.’

‘I’m not after punishment. If you picked up a Bronze Olympic medal that isn’t yours pls just send anonymously back to GB hockey-Bisham Abbey.’

Devastated: Hockey player Hannah Macleod has also tweeted that her medal was stolen as well. She also posted a photo of a man captured on CCTV who they believe has something to do with the theft

Unattended: The athletes left their jackets, with their medals inside, unattended at the Mahiki Nightclub in Mayfair, central London

Both athletes published a photo of a man captured on CCTV who they believe may have something to do with the theft although it is not known whether he in fact had any connection.

Ms Macleod’s tweet of the photo has gone viral, having been re-tweeted more than 17,000 times since she posted it just 11 hours ago.

She posted: ‘Had my Olympic medal stolen. Do you recognise this man? Please RT to help get my bronze medal back.’

Police are appealing for information after the athletes left their jackets unattended, with the medals inside them, were taken.

The CCTV image that was posted online had not been released by 
the police, a Metropolitan police spokesman said but detectives are currently analysing CCTV from the venue.

Royal thanks: The medals were stolen after the reception where the Queen met and congratulated successful Olympians and Paralympians including Hannah Cockcroft who won two gold medals at the Paralympics

Detective Chief Inspector James 
Harman said: 'I would appeal to anyone who was in the venue in the early
hours of Wednesday and saw anything suspicious to contact us - any 
information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, could prove vital 
to this investigation.

'My team have spoken to both 
Olympians who are understandably desperate to be reunited with the 
medals they have dedicated their careers to win.

'If you know who is responsible or where the medals are, please call us.'

The reception at Buckingham Palace was a chance for Her Majesty to say thank you and congratulations to the athletes for their brilliant display in the London Games.

The Queen and Philip first welcomed Prime Minister David Cameron, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt - formerly Culture Secretary - and other senior figures who made the Games possible, including Lord Coe, former chair of London 2012, in the Palace’s 18th Century Room.

The athletes arrived in their official Team GB formal wear of suits, which included a special inside pocket for their medals.

Another
Olympian used Twitter to share her experience of the event. Silver 
medallist Gemma Gibbons posted a photo of the royal water closet on her 
Twitter page to share with her 29,000 followers.

Flushed with pride: Gemma Gibbons also took to Twitter at the event, posting a picture of a Buckingham Palace toilet she took while attending the special reception on her Twitter page

She wrote 'Met the queen today, she has very posh toilets!', followed by a #howtheroyalspee.'

She said: 'I tweeted it without thinking, really, and I really hope that I’m not in trouble. It was such a lovely event that I wouldn’t want to end up in the Tower.’

Fortunately for Miss Gibbons, Buckingham Palace officials were very much amused. ‘We are just glad that our guests have a wonderful experience – wherever they might be in the palace,’ said a smiling aide.

Team GB began the summer’s medal rush by winning 65 in total, including 29 golds, an achievement that was hailed as the athletes’ 'greatest ever' performance by Andy Hunt, their chef de mission for London 2012.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Westminster CID on 020 7321 7650 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
