A chef has taken the concept of fusion food to a bizarre new level - by combining iconic Italian dishes spaghetti and ice cream.

Dario Fontanella's restaurant in Mannheim, Germany, has become famous for its unusual cuisine which is served with a twist.

He passes vanilla ice cream through a 
spaghetti press to create the distinctive appearance. To that he had to 
add a sweet sauce which looks like tomato.

Perfectionist: Dario Fontanella has spent the past thirty years dedicating himself to perfecting the Italian art of ice cream making

Mr Fontanella, whose father moved from Italy to Germany in 1931 where the family had set up a famous ice cream 
parlor, has toiled for the past thirty years to perfect the art of ice 
cream making.

He said: 'I'm always looking for better products that can bring our many different ice creams an even bigger taste experience.'

A mixture of pureed strawberries and grated chocolate, which mimics the cheese, is poured over the spaghetti to add to disorientate the taste buds even more.

Mr Fontanella has made a name for himself by making ice cream appear like an eclectic
 mix of different food - from wedding cakes and delicate fruit to bread sticks out of the frozen dairy product.Â
