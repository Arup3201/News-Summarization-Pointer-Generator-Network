This is the heart-stopping moment rescuers frantically try and save a man from his water-logged pickup truck. 

Raul Alamillo Jr. and Brent English, both water utility workers for the City of Dallas, were heading to a job on Tuesday morning when they spotted the vehicle plunged into the 20-foot-deep White Rock Creek.

Video footage captured by a witness shows them desperately trying to locate the driver as the truck slipped under the water's surface.

One of the men is seen wading over to the passenger window and smashing it open with a hammer.

The water is  leveled to the bottom of the window sill and continues to rise.

Unable to get to the driver from that side, another rescuer manages to wrench the other cabin door open.

It then takes a bit of team effort to swim the pickup driver to the water's edge. 

His body is hauled on dry land with his clothes completely drenched.

All in a day's work: The driver was rushed to hospital and is in a stable condition

The unidentified man was apparently another city worker and lost control of his Equipment and Building Services truck while having medical complications. 

Oscar Andrade, who was also involved in the rescue mission, told Fox News that the driver appeared to be having a seizure or  heart attack. 

The man was later rushed to hospital and reported to be in a stable condition.

It took crews several hours to pull his truck from the creek.

Alamillo, English and Andrade are now being hailed as heroes for their life-saving efforts.
