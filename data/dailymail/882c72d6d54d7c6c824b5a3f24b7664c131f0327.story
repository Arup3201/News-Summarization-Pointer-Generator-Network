With an enormous light show, giant Santas and lots of sparkle, Tesco's 2014 Christmas offering is everything we have come to expect from their annual advert.

But this year the company will be hoping the ad does more than boost Christmas sales as they attempt to claw back from a year that has seen them hit with scandal and massive financial losses.

Shares in Tesco have plummeted in recent months as the supermarket issued three profits warnings and is facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations that bosses inflated profits by £250million. 

The ad opens with a father searching for the Christmas decorations in the attic, much to the delight of his sons 

Hoping to prove they still put the customer first and are in touch with the average British family this year's advert focuses on the simple pleasures that come from out festive preparation.

The moving advert begins with a father rummaging around the attic looking for boxes of decorations from last year, while his children wait eagerly downstairs.

One by one we see families gathering to decorate their homes, while Tesco workers prepare to spread Christmas cheer.

The ad builds to the moment when Christmas lights are switched on in households and Tesco stores across the country.

Tesco will be hoping that the show of community spirit and impressive light display in the advert, for which Tesco enlisted the services of Wieden and Kennedy London, the company behind the light show at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, will go some way to mend their damaged public image.

The group has formally been placed under criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) following its discovery of a £263 million black hole in profit expectations. 

Following the allegations, eight of Tesco's executives have been suspended and last month the supermarket revealed its half-year profits had slumped 91 per cent to £112m.

The bank has already set aside £240million for customers who were miss-sold payment protection insurance. 

The company even went so far as to force executives to shop and cook to get them in touch with customers.

New chief executive Dave Lewis also has spoken of his wish to to make head office staff spend one day a fortnight in stores in a bid to stop customers deserting for German discounters Aldi and Lidl and to sweep away a culture at Tesco that included operating six corporate jets.

Perhaps attempting ot show that it still puts the customer first, the festive light show at the end of this year's advert is inspired by a Tesco customer, Claire Hannah, who last year tweeted her disappointment that her local store in didn't have a green hat.

In response Tesco created a winter wonderland at the store and invited Claire and over 800 local residents to enjoy the festivities and turn on the Christmas lights.

The show, which culminates with the green hat being placed on the store, was created by the people behind the light show at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony. 

Nearly one million LED lights covered a huge 78m long and 7.2m high screen in front of the store. 

The full light show and the crowd's reaction can be seen in an additional film that Tesco is publishing on YouTube for customers.

The advert made its debut on Sunday night during the season finale of ITV's Downton Abbey, ensuring that thousands across Britain saw it and marking the end of a week which has seen John Lewis, Argos, Marks and Spencer and Asda also reveal their Christmas campaigns. 

The ad builds to the moment when Christmas lights are switched on across the country, even by the sea 

As well as the advert the store have launched their 'Every Little Helps Make Christmas' campaign 

In addition to the advert, Tesco is launching a campaign, 'Every Little Helps Make Christmas,' which will celebrate the excitement around Christmas and focus on helping the nation celebrate.

Their iconic green hat  will appear on over 700 Tesco stores across the country, more than ever before.

Jill Easterbrook, Chief Customer Officer at Tesco says: 'Christmas is a wonderfully special time of year and we want to help customers in whatever way we can. Claire's experience is just one example of how we're doing every little thing we can to help make Christmas in fun and helpful ways. We're with our customers every step of the way through the festive season!'

Claire Hannah says, 'I was taken aback when Tesco first approached me - I couldn't believe my tweet had been noticed. It's amazing, Tesco has done a really lovely thing for the town, and I'm so chuffed our Tesco has the green hat this year!'

Ray Shaughnessy, Creative Director at Wieden and Kennedy London says, 'This year's campaign is an important step change for Tesco in that they are doing all sorts of unexpected things to help people have a brilliant Christmas. 

'It won't just be about them making sure you get the best turkey on the table, it will be about making sure that people feel Christmassy too. Getting the team behind the London 2012 Olympic light show to light up Wigan is a great example of this.'
