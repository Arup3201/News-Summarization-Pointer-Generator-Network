The most outlandish theory hanging in the moist heat of Kuala Lumpur was that Bernie Ecclestone is staging one of the cleverest heists in a career of clever heists by talking down the sport he spent a lifetime transforming.

The theory goes that he is criticising the lack of noise from the new V6 engines because he wants the value of Formula One to fall. He will then orchestrate the purchase of the majority share in the business at a reduced price and remain in charge for the rest of eternity.

His willing accomplice, so the conspiracy runs, could conceivably be Dietrich Mateschitz, the Red Bull owner, a fellow billionaire, friend and recent critic of the quieter engines.

Formula One's current majority owners, CVC, could then wash their hands of Ecclestone before a German court reaches a verdict later this year on whether their octogenarian billionaire chief executive bribed a German banker called Gerhard Gribkowsky the last time the sport was sold, in 2005.

According to the script, Ferrari, who possess a veto on these matters, would be induced onside, Ecclestone would stay in overall control and Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner would be tutored to take over if the old boy ever actually died.

Fanciful? Perhaps. After all it could be doing no more than stirring up controversy - in this case about something he fervently believes in, namely engine noise.

It is an old tactic of his that has made the Formula One soap opera rival Coronation Street with its cast of heroes, lunatics, cheats and Machiavellis.

But everything that happens in Formula One has a reason behind it. And Ecclestone talking down the product he sells is like Del Boy telling you the video recorder that's fallen off a lorry won't switch on. So, maybe, the buying it back story is not so mad after all.

Anyway, in his usual spirit of mischievousness Ecclestone said he would like to get the noise levels up, adding: 'I wish I could get it up.' He is 84 in October.

On a day when Mercedes' Nico Rosberg finished practice at the top of the timesheets to reinforce their status as favourites to win the Malaysian Grand Prix tomorrow, Ecclestone was hearing for real what the fuss was all about - the engines - for the first time.

He had previously only heard them in the Ferrari factory and on his television set at home a fortnight ago during the staging of the season-opener in Melbourne.

Here he declared them 'slightly better' than he had imagined - a result, to a degree, of the grandstand opposite the garages providing improved acoustics. That was about as generous as he got.

He said: 'Mr Ong, the Singapore promoter, is here and he told me that if the public don't like the engines then they will definitely stop hosting the race.

'Ron Walker in Australia is not happy. The Americans are not happy. Here, they are well down on public tickets. People go to F1 races for the atmosphere and the noise. I am not happy with what we have but we have to deal with it.

'I asked Stefano Domenicali (the Ferrari team principal) if anything can be done about it. He said he would ask his engineers but it is probably too late now. I said we should get the engineers goldplated PlayStations and send them to a desert island to play with them instead of building engines that are great pieces of equipment we don't need.'

Steady: Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel was third in the timesheets on Friday

Horner agreed that the sport is in need of an image makeover after the fallout from Melbourne - naturally enough as it was his driver, Daniel Ricciardo, who was disqualified for an alleged breach of the fuel-flow pressure. He said the rules were too complex for easy digestion by fans. He instead argued that the rule on fuel-flow pressure (of all tedious things) should be done away with and teams allowed to use their 100kg of fuel any way they liked.

The sagacity of his suggestion was reinforced by the fact that Ricciardo's new sensor failed during practice, underlining Red Bull's belief the equipment being used by the FIA is not reliable. They will argue as much at an appeal hearing on April 14.

Their form yesterday was encouraging: their world champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest, a place ahead of Rosberg's team-mate Lewis Hamilton and a place behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.

So will Red Bull again defy the FIA if they believe the sensor is at fault?

'Hopefully, we can agree something with the FIA that is sensible', said Horner non-commitally.
