One half of a randy couple ended up in court for causing criminal damage after their bed collapsed while having sex.

Adam Disney, 28, and his unknown partner also pulled down window drapes in the bedroom during the tryst following a night out in Liverpool.

A court heard that instead of going to one of their houses, they were unable to contain their passions and let themselves into a bedsit that Disney used to rent.

Unfortunately for Disney, he was spotted hanging out of the property’s window enjoying a post-passion cigarette.

Passion: The building (centre) containing the flat where Adam Disney brought down drapes and made the bed collapse. He admitted criminal damage. The betting shop was not thought to be involved

Amorous: Adam Disney's bed collapsed when he sneaked into his old flat in Wavertree High Street, Liverpool (pictured). A court heard it was the best he and his partner could do without offending public decency

Police visited the flat in Wavertree High Street after neighbours heard 'noises', Liverpool magistrates heard.

They found Disney in the empty flat - his companion had already left - and first charged him with burglary until he admitted the full story.

Dan Lupton, defending, blamed 'sexual antics' and said: 'This is a curious case of the morning after the night before.

'They had been drinking and the couple were passionate in their interest to have sexual relations.

'On this occasion they were seeking to avail themselves rather quickly.

'The closest place for them to seek refuge, in an effort to avoid offending public decency, was his former flat.'

Once
indoors the couple were 'carried away with the 
intensity of physical relations', Mr Lupton added.

The woman responsible for the flat later saw Disney leaning out of the window smoking.

Disney, of Widney Lane, Solihull, admitted criminal damage to the double bed and curtain rail, but denied breaking the windowsill when he leaned on it.

Chairman of the bench Stan Golding ordered him to pay £355, split into a £100 fine, £85 costs, £150 compensation to the owner and a £20 victim surcharge.

The flat's owner had asked for £500 and claimed the lock was damaged, but Mr Lupton described the premises as a 'shabby bedsit'.

He said: 'The windowsill was loose and they hadn’t done a good job of securing the curtain rail.

'This was not a posh hotel room.'
