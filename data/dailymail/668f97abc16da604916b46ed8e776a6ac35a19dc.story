Thousands of women in their forties will be offered statins under new guidelines drawn up by heart experts.

Middle-aged adults with unhealthy lifestyles will be routinely prescribed the drugs to prevent heart attacks and strokes in 20 years’ time.

Statins are usually given only to patients with heart disease, or those very likely to develop it within ten years, based on their family history or unhealthy lifestyle. They cost only 10p a day and are mainly taken by the over-65s.

Preventative: Statins are usually given only to patients at great risk of heart attacks, but new guidance may change this

But guidance drawn up by charities including the British Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association advises treating anyone at high risk of having a stroke or heart attack any time in their lives.

It is based on a computer calculator which works out patients’ lifetime risk of heart disease based on their family history, blood pressure, cholesterol, whether they smoke, where they live, ethnicity and age.

The advice will mean younger patients in their forties and fifties – and in some cases thirties – with a high lifetime risk are now deemed eligible.

Crucially, it will lead to more women being offered the drugs. They tend to develop heart disease on average ten years later than men, which means they are not usually deemed to be at high risk under the current advice.

Risk: Experts have said that prescribing the drug earlier can bring greater benefits over a lifetime

Around 7million Britons take statins, which work by lowering cholesterol and preventing fatty deposits building up in the arteries. Experts cannot say how many more will be offered the drugs as a result of these new guidelines but they will become commonly taken among younger age groups.

The guidance was published by the Joint British Societies - which include the British Heart Foundation, the Stroke Association, Heart UK and Diabetes UK - after concerns of rising levels of obesity and heart disease.

It will be used by GPs carrying out health MoTs, the five-yearly NHS checks offered to all patients aged 40 to 70.

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘If you take a woman, let’s say in her early forties, with stonkingly high cholesterol, very high blood pressure and who smokes, her ten-year risk is still fairly low. But her lifetime risk is huge.

‘People need to start changing their lifestyles at a much earlier age. If you wait until your fifties and sixties, it’s too late.’

Professor Sir Rory Collins, of Oxford University, who has carried out extensive research on statins, said: ‘The difference with these guidelines is they are saying that although risk is lower at younger ages, your potential benefit over the long term is greater.’

Sir Rory recently said patients were unnecessarily dying from heart attacks because doctors were overly cautious about prescribing statins. Side-effects include nausea, cataracts and, most seriously, myopathy, a condition leading to muscle pain and potential fatal liver failure.

NICE, the NHS medicines regulator, is due to publish its own guidelines on statins this summer but they will take into account this new advice from heart experts.
