Daniel Sturridge's injury frustration continues as he has not been included in Liverpool's squad for their Champions League game in Basle.

The England striker has been sidelined since damaging his thigh on international duty on September 5 but Brendan Rodgers was hoping Sturridge would show enough progress to be included in the squad.

Liverpool left John Lennon Airport around midday on Tuesday for their first Champions League away trip in five years. Defender Mamadou Sakho was also omitted from the travelling party.

However, the 25-year-old, who started training briefly towards the end of last week, has not made sufficient recovery and has been left behind on Merseyside to continue his rehabilitation, while Liverpool bid to maintain their 100 per cent start to Group D against Basle.

When asked if Sturridge would figure before the international break after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Everton, Rodgers said 'I hope so' but it remains to be seen whether he will be for to face West Brom at Anfield this weekend.

Liverpool are due to train in St Jakob Park on Tuesday. They were the only English team to win their opening group game and under-pressure goalkeeper Simon Mignolet believes the return to Europe gives his team the perfect opportunity to banish their frustrations after squandering two late points against Everton.

Mignolet said: 'It is another big game to look forward to. We were disappointed to only get one point against Everton because I felt we deserved all three and a clean sheet. 

'On Wednesday we hope to get a second victory in the Champions League because that would give us a good chance and a good perspective for the rest of the group.

'It is something positive if you have another game to look forward to and try and do well again and get three points.'
