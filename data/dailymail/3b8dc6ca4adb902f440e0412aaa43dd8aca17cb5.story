Team news

Tottenham 

Tottenham full-back Kyle Naughton will miss this weekend's clash with QPR through suspension.

The 25-year-old is banned after being sent off in the Premier League opener at West Ham, leaving him on the sidelines with Kyle Walker (pelvis) and Vlad Chiriches (back).

Emmanuel Adebayor, Christian Eriksen, Younes Kaboul, Aaron Lennon and Etienne Capoue will return after being rested for Thursday's energy-sapping Europa League clash at AEL Limassol.

Tom Carroll travelled to Cyprus but has since joined Swansea on a season-long loan.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Naughton, Kaboul, Dawson, Vertonghen, Dier, Davies, Rose, Veljkovic, Capoue, Bentaleb, Sandro, Paulinho, Dembele, Eriksen, Lamela, Lennon, Chadli, Townsend, Holtby, Adebayor, Kane, Soldado.

QPR

Harry Redknapp could hand debuts to Mauricio Isla and Leroy Fer in Sunday's London derby at Tottenham.

Isla and Fer are both fit and have been training but fellow new recruit Eduardo Vargas is not in contention as he still requires a work permit having signed on loan from Napoli.

Chile international Isla could come in for Danny Simpson, while Fer only featured as a subsitute once for Norwich before his move and could start from the bench at White Hart Lane.

Provisional squad: Green, Murphy, Hill, Dunne, Ferdinand, Onuoha, Caulker, Yun, Simpson, Traore, Isla, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Faurlin, Hoilett, Phillips, Wright-Phillips, Austin, Remy, Zamora.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Tottenham have won four of their last six Premier League games against QPR, with one of those wins masterminded by current Rangers boss Harry Redknapp.

In their last Premier League campaign (2012-13), QPR took fewer points from London derbies than any other side (nine in 10 games).

QPR have won just four of their last 40 Premier League games.

Tottenham have won four of their last five Premier League games.

Joey Barton has created more goalscoring chances than any other Premier League player this season (6).

Tottenham, along with Stoke, were one of only two teams not to pick up a booking on the opening weekend.

Tottenham have won each of their last four Premier League home games, scoring 14 goals in the process.

The Lilywhites have won all but two of their Premier League home games in 2014 (losing to Manchester City and Arsenal).

In 102 Premier League London derbies at home, Spurs have only won one more (38) than they have drawn (37).

Rio Ferdinand has not conceded a foul in any of his last 27 Premier League appearances.
