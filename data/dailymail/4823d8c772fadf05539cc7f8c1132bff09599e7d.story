When Molly Askham was just ten weeks old, her parents noticed that one side of her head was much flatter than the other.

Doctors diagnosed her with a severe skull deformity called plagiocephaly or ‘flat head syndrome’ – but told Michelle and Peter Askham that treatment wasn’t available on the NHS.

Desperate to make their little girl better, Mr and Mrs Askham were forced to take out a payday loan to fund private care.

Molly Askham (pictured with mother, Michelle) developed 'flat head syndrome' as a newborn baby which meant that her skull became misshapen

Plagiocephaly affects the soft skulls of newborn babies, and in Molly’s 
case was so extreme that one ear appeared to have moved towards the back
 of her head.

Doctors told Mrs Askham, 27, and her 32-year-old husband 
that the problem should cure itself – but instead it got worse.

The couple contacted a private clinic which uses a specially designed 
helmet to reshape the head, but the treatment cost £2,000 and a £500 
deposit was required before it could begin.

With no savings to fall back on, the couple searched for moneylenders on
 the internet.

They took out a high-interest £200 ‘payday loan’ and 
another expensive £200 ‘doorstep loan’.

The family held fundraising 
events to obtain the rest of the money, and eventually Molly was given 
her helmet.

It works by holding the normal side  of the head in position
 while providing a ‘gap’ for the flattened side to grow into.

After wearing it 23 hours a day for four months, her head is a normal shape again – but her parents are still in debt.

Mrs Askham, whose husband has a low-paid job with a welding company, 
said they were making regular repayments to the doorstep lender and had 
had to borrow money from her parents to repay the other cash loan, which
 had already doubled.

She needed a £2,000 specially designed helmet to reshape her head but the NHS would not pay for the treatment as they considered it to be 'cosmetic' and doctors believed that it would correct itself

Molly's worried parents had to turn to payday and doorstep loans to fund her treatment and after she had been wearing the helmet for just 17 weeks she had recovered sufficiently that she no longer required it

The mother of two said she was ‘shocked and angry’ to discover the 
treatment for such a severe form of plagiocephaly was not available on 
the NHS because it was regarded as ‘cosmetic’ – even though breast 
enlargement surgery and tattoo removals were sometimes provided.

Mrs 
Askham, from Leeds, said: ‘Funding should be available for a deformity 
as bad as this.

‘It’s horrible to think of your child as being deformed, but that’s what
 it is.

'Her ear was not where it was meant to be and her nose was moving
 as well.'

These helmets do work and worked very well for Molly.

‘But it was very frightening and it seemed as if her skin was moving. 
She was a little girl and one ear was in a strange place.’

Molly’s head was normal when she was born five weeks prematurely last 
August at St James’s Hospital in Leeds, weighing 4lb 14oz. 

She spent two periods in hospital during the early weeks of her life 
because she developed an intolerance to cow’s milk and had meningitis.

By the age of ten weeks it was ‘very noticeable’ that one side of 
Molly’s head had become flat.

The local NHS Airedale, Bradford and Leeds Primary Care Trust was 
recently disbanded, but in an earlier statement on the case said: ‘The 
NHS does not usually fund the use of cranial remoulding orthosis for 
babies with plagiocephaly.

‘This is a largely cosmetic issue and in the majority of cases the 
condition will resolve spontaneously with advice around positioning of 
the baby.’

She spent her first few weeks in and out of hospital because she developed meningitis but she is now a healthy baby. Her parents are continuing to pay off the loans
