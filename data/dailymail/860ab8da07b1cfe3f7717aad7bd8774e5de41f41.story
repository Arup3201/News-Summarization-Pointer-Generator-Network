This is the near-fatal moment a commuter train runs over a 78-year-old woman's car leaving her hospitalized with multiple injuries.

Footage captured by a dashcam inside the locomotive, shows Patricia Vitale suddenly pulling out in front of it around 7am Tuesday in Itasca, Illinois.

Unable to stop in time, the driver sounds the horn in emergency. As the carriages hit Ms Vitale's Honda Accord and drag it along, a loud crunching sound can be heard.

Authorities released the video to Eyewitness News as a warning to other drivers to be vigilant in icy weather.

Lucky escape: The senior is currently in intensive care with broken vertebrae, broken ribs, a punctured lung and other internal injuries

Apparently the gates were closing at the Irving Park Road and Walnut Street crossing when Ms Vitale slid under the barriers.

Eye witnesses said that she braked and put her reverse lights on but wasn't able to get off the tracks in time.

The Metra commuter train hit her head-on from the passenger side.

Amazingly Ms Vitale - a retired grade school teacher - survived the incident and remained conscious but her car was totaled.

The senior is currently in intensive care with broken vertebrae, broken ribs, a punctured lung and other internal injuries.

Team effort: Rescue crews extracted Ms Vitale from the scene and worked to clean up the debris - Only minor delays were caused to the train schedule

Her son, Jim, who she was meant to meet that morning a car repair shop, said he found out about the accident en route.

He believes that maybe she was bumped by another driver from behind as she's crossed the railroad tracks 'thousands of times over the years' and never had any problem.

'Something doesn't add up. I can see some explanation that she slid a little bit, but it seems to make more sense that maybe she was bumped,' he said.

Rescue crews extracted Ms Vitale from the scene and worked to clean up the debris. Only minor delays were caused to the train schedule.

Police are still investigating the crash to determine the cause.
