A coronial inquest into the death of two-year-old Darcy Atkinson has heard that the toddler was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died.

He was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath under his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor's care.

'We need to call an ambulance because this isn't normal,' Mr Taylor was urged by his flatmate, Nicole Warne, Glebe Coroners Court was told on Monday.

Darcy died from brain injuries the next day, December 7, 2012.

The boy, described by his father Peter Atkinson as smart and proud, had earlier been paddle boarding with Mr Taylor, the inquest was told.

This is despite his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell claiming her son was 'petrified' of water, News Corp reports.

He'd experienced difficulty returning to daycare after a week-long holiday and was instead put in Mr Taylor's care after telling his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell he didn't want to go to school.

While on the board, Darcy had fallen back and bumped his head, Mr Taylor is alleged to have written in a text to Ms Rae-Maxwell.

Mr Taylor then took Darcy to the home he shared with Ms Warne for a swim.

Darcy seemed fine, Ms Warne told the inquest, but he twice vomited while near the pool.

Both adults became concerned when he again threw up, this time an alarming chunky-white mixture.

They took Darcy to a bathroom and ran a bath to warm the boy but his body became stiff.

'That's when Adam started to panic,' Ms Warne said.

Darcy, she said, was making loud, deep, gargling sounds but couldn't speak.

The usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death, the court heard.

When he died he had bruising on his ears, temple and limbs and traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system.

After informing Ms Rae-Maxwell Darcy had bumped his head, Mr Taylor allegedly sent her a photo of the boy.

'Adam sent me pictures all the time of Darcy when he had him,' Ms Rae-Maxwell said.

But she repeatedly denied receiving the photo that day and it has never been located by investigators.

Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon questioned how a mother who posted so many Facebook photos of her son couldn't locate the image.

'I know it sounds ridiculous. I've been through so many phones,' she said.

The inquest continues.
