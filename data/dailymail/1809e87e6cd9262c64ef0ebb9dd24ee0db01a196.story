Jamie Foxx has been accused of transphobia after making fun of Bruce Jenner and his reported gender transition into becoming a woman.

The actor made the inappropriate comment while hosting the 2015 iHeartRadio Music Awards held at the Shrine Auditorium in LA on Sunday.

He said: 'We have some groundbreaking performances here too tonight. We got Bruce Jenner, will be here doing some musical performances. He’s doing a his and her duet all by himself.'

Speaking out: Perez Hilton lead a barrage of comments on Twitter accusing Foxx of being transphobic 

Jamie then added: 'Look, I’m just busting your balls while I still can.'

Although Bruce has still yet to publicly discuss his rumored gender reassignment, it didn't stop host Foxx from receiving a backlash on Twitter over his remarks.

Perez Hilton was first to tweet complaining: 'Boo! Shame on you #iHeartAwards for allowing @iamjamiefoxx to be transphobic on national television! Those #BruceJenner jokes were wrong!!!'.

According to a photo released before the event, Jenner's daughter Kylie was supposed to be in the audience Sunday night. It's unclear if she showed up, since she wasn't pictured on the red carpet Sunday night

Transition: Bruce Jenner - pictured in LA earlier this month - is reportedly undergoing gender reassignment surgery 

Another Twitter user wrote: 'That transphobic joke about Bruce Jenner was not necessary & not funny at all #iHeartRadioMusicAwards.'

Jenner's daughter Kylie was reportedly supposed to be attending the awards with her rapper boyfriend Tyga,  according to a picture posted before the event which showed placecards with their names attached to chairs at the venue.  However, it's unclear if she showed up to the event since Kylie wasn't spotted on the red carpet Sunday night.

Daily Mail Online reached out to iHeartMedia and the production company which puts on the annual awards, Done + Dusted, for comment about the joke but we did not receive an immediate response.

Despite not commenting publicly, there have been various reports about Bruce's transition, and that he has the full support of his children.

A source close to the family recently told People that his sons Burt, Brandon and Brody are giving their dad their blessing, as well as step daughter Kim Kardashian.

However, Kendall Jenner recently denied that she spoke about her father's transition, after a publication claimed she had said she would 'always love' Bruce whether 'he's a man or a woman'.
