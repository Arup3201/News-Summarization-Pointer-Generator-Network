The police officer at the centre of the Plebgate controversy is suing Andrew Mitchell – and his superior has backed his version of events.

Sergeant Ben Mills said he was told by PC Toby Rowland that Andrew Mitchell called him a ‘f****** pleb’ two minutes after his run-in with the then chief whip at Downing Street.

Sgt Mills was PC Rowland’s immediate superior at the time.

Legal row: PC Toby Rowland is to sue Andrew Mitchell, who last week called him a serial liar and demanded he repeat his claims the Tory MP called police 'plebs' in Downing Street

PC Rowland has announced he is suing Mr Mitchell for saying he lied.

Mr Mitchell is already suing the officer for libel. The cases are likely to be heard together next year.

Sgt
 Mills – who is retired – told Sky News: ‘He told me he had given a man 
who claimed to be the chief whip a section five public order warning. 
Obviously I was a little bit taken aback.

‘I
 asked him how did that come about and he said the man had sworn at him 
and called him a f****** pleb. He then said the man cycled away and said
 he had not heard the last of it.’

Mr Mitchell was served with legal papers by lawyers on Tuesday night.

Last
 week the Crown Prosecution Service said PC Rowland will not face 
criminal charges because there is not enough evidence he was lying.

Mr
 Mitchell then attacked the Met, and branded PC Rowland a serial liar. 
He demanded he repeat his story on oath – and PC Rowland accepted.

Wrangle: Mr Mitchell at the gate where he clashed with the officer. He flatly denies claims that he used the word pleb after he was stopped cycling through the street's gates last September

Mr
 Mitchell denies using the word pleb after he was stopped from cycling 
in the main gate to Downing Street in September last year.

PC
 Rowland said Mr Mitchell said: ‘You should know your f****** place, you
 don’t run this f****** Government, you’re f****** plebs.’

However, the MP insists he said: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’.

Highly
 trained firearms officer PC Rowland was not arrested and is not facing 
disciplinary action.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders 
said in a statement last week ‘Mr Mitchell’s account has varied.’

One
 police officer has been charged with lying about witnessing the scene, 
but there is no evidence PC Rowland was involved in any way.

Wounded: Former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell lost his over the cycling scandal

The Tory MP made the claims after the Crown Prosecution Service said 
there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about 
what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry.

Mr Mitchell 
said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic 
phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth.

'I
 will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention
 to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account.

‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry.

'I have told the truth about this incident. The police did not. My reputation was destroyed. I was vilified, relentlessly.

'What I do know is that I was stitched up; I was fitted up in Downing Street by armed police officers whose sole duty is to defend officials and to defend Downing Street.'

'We believe that the CCTV shows that the account of PC Toby Rowland is at very best inaccurate.

'I never said these phrases... no-one speaks like that these days. It's like a Hooray Henry, a lout from a 1920s B-movie being sort of characterised.'

But Mr Rowland said he stood by his account of what was said.

Mr Mitchell also claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a
 suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police 
Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers
 of wrongdoing.

Prosecutors have decided a single
 officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, 
which involved taking more than 1,100 statements.

PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office following allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row.

Five
 officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, 
will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, 
meaning they could lose their jobs.

Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings.
