An Arkansas woman was charged on Tuesday with manslaughter in the death of her 10-month-old son after investigators said she and her husband took the boy into a rugged part of the Ouachita Mountains while having drug-induced hallucinations about being chased.

Brooke Sueann Floyd, 21, of Greenwood, surrendered to Yell County officers on Tuesday and went free under terms of a $50,000 bond posted on a previous child endangerment charge. 

She is due in a Danville court on Thursday.

Brian Floyd and his ten-month-old son Harper Floyd were found dead in the remote Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas on July 29

The baby boy, Harper, and Floyd's husband, 33-year-old Brian Floyd, were found dead last week after a four-day search in an area about 80 miles west of Little Rock.

Deputies said they suspected something was amiss when Brooke Floyd emerged from heavy brush and reported the pair missing but didn't tell searchers where they might be. 

'I asked her if she was taking any medication because she appeared to be hallucinating many of the events she described,' sheriff's Capt. John Foster Jr. wrote in an affidavit. 

She said the woman told him she had recently used methamphetamine and an anti-seizure medication.

Foster also wrote that Floyd initially told officers the family was being chased but later believed the story was based on mutual hallucinations she was having with her husband.

'She seemed to be indicating that they would tell each other what they were seeing or experiencing as they were hallucinating and then the other would believe they also saw or experienced the same thing,' Foster wrote.

Brooke Floyd was found July 25 in a ditch in the Ouachita National Forest, with bruises, bare feet and scratches that suggested she had walked through the thick woods for a long time, Foster said.

According to an affidavit seen by Thv11, Brooke Floyd told police that she and her husband left their home at 1am in the morning because they were being followed. The couple drove into the woods where they were attacked, she then said. 

Police officers then reported that the 21-year-old changed her story and said that they had left their home 12 hours later. 

According to the affidavit: 'She did not show any emotion and did not appear to be frantic or even openly concerned about the baby's well-being.'

The family's pickup truck was found July 28 and Brian and Harper's bodies were found the next day.

Preliminary autopsy reports said the child died of 'exposure and abandonment'. The cause of the husband's death was awaiting toxicology results.

Bill James, the woman's lawyer, said he does not believe the woman is guilty.

The family's pick-up truck is towed away to be examined from where it was found in the Ouachita Mountains last week. Floyd initially told officers the family was being chased but later believed the story was based on mutual hallucinations she was having with her husband

The Floyds, who lived in Greenwood, were seen together in a green pickup truck in Mansfield on Thursday evening and again the next morning in Yell County, between Moore's Chapel Cemetery and Lick Creek Recreation Area.

According to an arrest report, Brian Floyd was previously questioned by police on July 20 after he falsely reported a burglary at his home.

The report, seen by 5 News, reported that the 911 dispatcher told responding officers that the caller had a history of mental illness.

Officers found Brian Floyd driving around his home in a 'manic state' and hallucinating, claiming that a woman had broken in and there was a police officer on the roof with a dog.

Police reported no disturbances at the property. A family member told police he was having problems with his medication.
