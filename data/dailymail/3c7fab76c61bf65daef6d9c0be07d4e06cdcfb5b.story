Tube drivers could go on strike after a colleague was sacked for allegedly drinking alcohol on the job.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union on the Northern Line will vote in the coming weeks on a campaign of industrial action over the dismissal.

Union leaders said today Transport for London was guilty of 'fitting up' the driver as part of a wider culture of 'harassment' of their staff. 

Battle: Tube drivers will be asked if they want to strike after Transport for London sacked a worker for allegedly drinking on the job

General secretary Mick Cash said: 'RMT has been pointing out for some time now that a new culture of harassment and misuse of procedures is rife on London Underground at the moment and the union will not stand back while individuals are fitted up and picked off, as has happened in this particular case on the Northern Line.' 

Tube bosses said in order to keep passengers safe it must have a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol at work, and accused union leaders of trying to strike before the driver's disciplinary case had been heard.

Nigel Holness of London Underground said: 'To ensure the safety of our customers, we operate a zero-tolerance policy towards alcohol at work. Anyone found to be in breach of this policy faces a disciplinary process and possible dismissal.

'The RMT leadership has decided to ballot its members before the disciplinary process has been concluded and before any employment tribunal'. 

It is not the first time unions bosses have threatened to strike over alcohol.

Ten years ago the RMT again wanted industrial action after five Tube workers were sacked following the discovery of more than 100 cans of alcohol in a mess room.

Tube company Metronet said the dismissals of the track maintenance staff related to its 'zero tolerance policy on alcohol'.

A total of 15 staff were suspended after an assortment of 11 full and empty cans of beer and cider, plus an empty bottle of brandy, were discovered at Farringdon station.

But the RMT said that there was 'not a shred of evidence' linking the sacked workers to the booze, although the sacked men eventually lost their employment tribunals for unfair dismissal. 

In March London Underground driver has been arrested after he allegedly downed a bottle of vodka before starting his shift.

The 50-year-old man is believed to have got drunk after getting into a row with his girlfriend on Saturday, it was reported.

He then allegedly took the controls of a northbound Jubilee Line train and carried on driving when he was meant to take a break 

It is claimed he was meant to stop at Wembley Park in north-west London, but he did not get out of the train until several stations later.

At that point a colleague smelled alcohol on his breath and the police were called.

The driver was arrested after failing to provide a breath sample and suspended from duty.
