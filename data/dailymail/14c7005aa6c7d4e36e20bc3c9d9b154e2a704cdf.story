Malia Obama has been visiting New York City universities.

The 16-year-old First Daughter, who graduates next year, was spotted at NYU campus with her mother Michelle Obama and Secret Service personnel on Friday morning.

Later the group was spotted at her father's alma mater: Columbia University.

It comes after tours of schools on the West Coast, including Stanford University, where former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton was educated, and the University of California at Berkeley. 

Malia, a high school junior, was given a private view of NYU's Goddard residential halls, with unaware students told the elevators would be down for 10 minutes.

At one point, she was spotted walking with a group of girls her age, seemingly on a group tour. 

Believed to be an aspiring filmmaker, she no doubt harbors an interest in the Tisch campus, NYU's film academy.

At lunchtime, crowds swarmed as the First Lady and First Daughter dropped into student cafe Community Food and Juice.

Malia went into 11th grade this fall at the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. 

The Sidwell parent's guide to college counseling suggests that juniors take the PSAT test in October, visit colleges as time allows, take the SAT exam in March and set up a family meeting with a college counselor in late spring, among other steps. 

And the President is evidently already contemplating the moment he will have to say goodbye to his first-born. 

'I've got to practice, because Malia is graduating in two years,' he told a high school graduation last summer. 

'I'm trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her. So this is sort of my trial run here.'
