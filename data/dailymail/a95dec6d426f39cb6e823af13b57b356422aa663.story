John Terry took some time out from his intense pre-season training sessions to enjoy a round of golf with some celebrity friends of Monday.

The Chelsea captain, who signed a new one-year deal towards the end of last season, has been seen playing golf with his children on his Instagram account this week - but he has now been joined by some more competitive opponents.

Chelsea flop Andriy Shevchenko, now a semi-professional golf player, One Direction's Niall Horan and Sportsmail's own Jamie Redknapp were snapped at exclusive The Wisley golf course in Surrey.

Terry and Redknapp came out on top against the One Direction and ex-AC Milan pairing of Horan and Shevchenko in a tight round.

And that win was rewarded by post-victory coffee, as Terry shared another video showing himself with Horan and Redknapp.

Terry has already started training for the new season and will hope to help get Jose Mourinho's team off to the best possible start come their opening game against Burnley on August 16.
