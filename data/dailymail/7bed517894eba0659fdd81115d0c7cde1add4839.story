Anthony Weiner’s most recent sexting mate Sydney Leathers has revealed her ten point plan for other loose women who might wish to follow her lead and seduce a lusty politician.

Leathers, 22, not so long ago a simple aspiring paralegal from Indiana, is refusing to bow out of the public spotlight either quietly or gracefully, much to the chagrin of the New York mayoral hopeful.

In her simple guide to having a sexting relationship with a politician, she regular cites her relationship with Weiner and paints an unflattering picture of a deeply insecure, incredibly vain man who was constant looking for reassurance, much like a small child.

Leathers' guide has appeared on xojane.com, the controversial and provocative women’s lifestyle website described as ‘where women go when they are being selfish, and where their selfishness is applauded.’

Much of her unlikely advice reads like a list of lazy clichés for how one might go about seducing a powerful man - consisting of ego massage, coyness and more ego massaging – but considering what Anthony Weiner has previously revealed about himself, every word may well be true. 

Her number one advice for snaring a politician is to ‘indulge his crazy alter-ego, and whatever you do, don't laugh at him.’

Leathers writes that politicians require a lot of attention, needing to be ‘coddled like a baby’ and so she says you must be prepared to be there for them at any time of day or night.

‘Basically, pretend like you're dating the middle school version of yourself. Like the prepubescent horny teenage girl with all these emotions,’ she writes, while noting that keeping a straight face is also extremely important.

She reveals that Weiner thanked her every time she helped him have an orgasm and that his incessant use of the word ‘baby’ when addressing her was ‘too much.’

Another of her golden rules is: ‘Find a horny non-politician to finance all the expensive shoes and lingerie pics you're sexting your politician boyfriend.’

According to Leather a relationship with a politician is all about excitement and fun but she also recommends having someone else on the go to provide security and help finance your politician sexting.

‘With a politician, you have to remember: You're probably not going to get money. You're in it for the thrill of it,’ she writes.

She reveals that at the same time as her affair with Weiner, she had a ‘bored, rich man’ sending her money in return for ‘selfies’ - sexy pictures of herself in provocative positions and langurie.

Another lesson from this sexting master is: ‘Figure out his weaknesses early on. If he's insecure, you've hit gold. Then torture him by playing hard to get.’

In order to gain the upper hand in a game of control with any politician, Leathers recommends never responding to anything immediately and often waiting up to two days before replying.

This technique ensured that Weiner remained interested in her, but she also confesses that she ended up planning her days around him because they talked and sexted so regularly.

‘Pathetic, but at least he never knew that,’ she writes.

Leathers has revealed that Weiner would ask her to rate photos of him and be specific about how sexy he looked

Her next piece of advice is ‘Be a little coy first. Don't be so aggressive.’

She
reveals that when Weiner first flirted with her she would pretend she 
didn’t know what was going on which only encouraged him more. 

‘That just makes them 10 times more interested. It's a little trick,’ she writes.

But then with her next golden rule, Leathers appears to contradict herself: ‘Give him more attention than he's ever known from a woman. Tell him he is sexy, and be specific about why he is.’

It’s hardly a revelation but Leathers writes that ‘politicians are the biggest attention whores you will ever meet.’

She also gives an interesting insight 
into Weiner’s ego when she reveals that he would ask her to be specific 
about how sexy he was and would ask her to rate photos of him.

‘He would really want to know which rant on the house floor was the sexiest. What turned me on the most.,’ she writes.

According to Leathers as playing coy you also have to sometimes ‘play along with whatever he wants’ in order to drive him wild.

‘With Anthony, I said whatever he wanted to hear, and I took a ton of pictures. We talked on the phone all the time. I gave him as much attention as he wanted. It was like a drug for him,’ she writes.

She even referenced an example of sexting between the pair:

Dangr33: I was reading your tweets and looking at your pics. so I thought i'd hold your wrists to settle you down.

Sydney: ...you have no idea how turned on I am right now. I really want you to manhandle me.

Leathers revealed that Weiner used to regularly trash talk about New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and told her that he was an 'effing loser'

Leathers, busy attempting to keep her 15 minutes of infamy going as long as she possibly can, told Gawker in a separate interview that she would endorse his Weiner's penis for mayor before she would endorse the man himself.

She also revealed that Weiner regularly trash talked current New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to her.

Leathers said that her former sexting partner described Bloomberg as 'effing loser' who 'had to buy his third term.'

He also told her that while people hated Bloomberg, they loved him. Leather said that was 'the typical narcissistic type of statement you’d hear from him.'

In the same interview she also confirmed that she had used sugar daddy websites to flirt
with older men in the past, she described it as ‘no big 
deal’ and just a phase when she was younger.
