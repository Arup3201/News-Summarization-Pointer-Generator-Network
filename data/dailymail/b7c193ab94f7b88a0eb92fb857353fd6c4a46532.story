Dabbled: Sir Roger Moore admitted he tried Viagra once but that it did not work

As James Bond he rarely encountered problems satisfying his conquests in bed.

But off-screen it appears Sir Roger Moore needed help to ensure he was able to perform between the sheets.

The 007 star has confessed he once tried Viagra – but it did not work.

Moore, 86, made the admission during a radio interview as he was asked about his diabetes.

He appeared to confuse the blue pills for prescription tablets for his condition.

The presenter clarifies the error to Moore who then replies: ‘I once took one [referring to Viagra] it did not work.’

He added the problem had ‘gone’ as he had ‘fixed’ it.

Moore was speaking on LBC on Sunday ahead of his new UK tour during which he will promote his latest book Last Man Standing: Tales from Tinseltown.

Moore was the longest-serving 007, starring in seven films between 1973 and 1985. He also appeared in TV series such as The Saint and The Persuaders! He retired from acting in 2009.

Moore and his wife Kristina ‘Kiki’ Tholstrup divide their time between their homes in Monaco and Switzerland.

Like Bond, Moore also enjoyed a martini. But he can no longer drink the ‘shaken, not stirred’ cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes, he has revealed.

Elaborating about his illness and the near-death drama he encountered which led to his diagnosis, Moore told the radio station he now takes ‘blood every morning’: ‘Last November my wife Kristina said to me “You are not well”. 

She called the doctor and he sent a man round very quickly and a man came with oxygen. ‘He arrived within three minutes and he called an ambulance and within 10 minutes, in my bedroom there was 16 people, including two policemen, firemen, two fire engines outside. 

The apartment where I live in Monaco, people were calling the concierge and asking if it was on fire. I was carted off to hospital.

‘Where your haemoglobin level should be 14 or 15, mine was down to five. I was going rapidly. They took me off and they searched to find where I had a bleed of some sort and they never found it. I had cameras up everywhere, down everywhere, swallowing them and they can’t find out.

They put five or six units in me and after about five days I started to feel a little better and now I feel great and now I take blood every morning. It does not hurt.’

Moore was diagnosed with diabetes and has been forced to cut out sugar and no longer drinks. 

Revealing how he copes with the illness he said: ‘We also have a lovely lady from the Philippines who is a nurse and she puts all the pills I have to take, which are numerous, in little plastic bags. 

'I am coping with diabetes but I am a chocolate lover and you can find some without sugar which are for diabetics.

'My wife looks after me and people in the street, they say “God he’s fat”.'

Two years ago Moore, a father of three, disclosed how he suffered domestic violence at the hands of two of his former wives.

In a candid television interview, the 84 year-old once claimed his first wife, Doorn Van Steyn (above), whom he married in 1946 aged 19, repeatedly punched and scratched him and also threw a teapot at him

The ice skater, real name was Lucy Woodard who died in 2010, also left him with scars and also punched his doctor as he treated him for a slashed hand, he said.

The actor also claimed that his second wife, Dorothy Squires - whom he married shortly after divorcing Van Steyn in 1953 – was also violent and attacked him after learning he had been unfaithful.

During his marriage to Squires, whom he divorced in 1968, he also claimed she hit him over the head with a guitar.
