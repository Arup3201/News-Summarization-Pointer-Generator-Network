Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor Nigel Lawson warned her controversial poll tax would be 'completely unworkable and politically catastrophic', newly-released government files reveal.

In 1985 he told the Prime Minister of the 'horrifying' impact of the flat rate of tax, in a memo which has been made public for the first time.

However, adviser Oliver Letwin, now David Cameron's policy chief, helped to convince Mrs Thatcher to use Scotland as a 'trailblazer' for the new tax which replaced the old domestic rates based on property values. 

Mrs Thatcher's Chancellor Nigel Lawson warned the poll tax would be 'completely unworkable and politically catastrophic'

In a strongly worded memo, Mr Lawson said: 'A flat-rate poll tax would be politically unsustainable; even with a rebate scheme the package would have an unacceptable impact on certain types of household.'

He wrote of the 'horrifying' impact as 'a pensioner couple in Inner London could find themselves paying 22 per cent of their net income in poll tax, whereas a better off couple in the suburbs pay only 1 per cent.'

Mr Lawson continued: 'The biggest gainers would be better off households in high rateable value properties; the losers would be poorer households, particularly larger ones.

'We should be forced to give so many exemptions and concessions (inevitably to the benefit of high spending authorities in Inner London) that the flat-rate poll tax would rapidly become a surrogate income tax.'

Mrs Thatcher was urged to use Scotland as a 'trailblazer' for the new tax in the teeth of the opposition of senior colleagues

The introduction of the community charge, as it was officially known, in Scotland in 1989 and the following year in England and Wales, provoked riots and protests across the country

Even environment minister Kenneth Baker, the scheme's architect, was beginning to have doubts, proposing a watered-down alternative combining the flat-tax levy with elements of a property charge.

A study by the Department of the Environment identified 'a number of unpleasant effects', with some 7.5 million households – 44 per cent of the total - set to lose out.

The community charge, as it was officially known, was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and the following year in England and Wales.

It proved to be a disaster for the Tories, provoking riots and protests across the country and helping to precipitate Mrs Thatcher's final downfall.  

However, papers released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, show that Mr Letwin helped to convince Mrs Thatcher to use Scotland as a 'trailblazer' for the new tax in the teeth of the opposition of senior colleagues.

The introduction of the community charge, as it was officially known, in Scotland in 1989 and the following year in England and Wales, provoked riots and protests across the country and eventually led to Mrs Thatcher's final downfall.

Oliver Letwin, who is now David Cameron's policy chief, worked as an adviser in Number 10 in the 1980s and urged Margaret Thatcher to press ahead with the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland

The seeds of the debacle were sown four years earlier in 1985, when she was persuaded by environment ministers Kenneth Baker and William Waldegrave that she could realise her long-held ambition to abolish the old domestic rates - based on property values - through a new, flat-rate tax payable by all adults.

In 1985 Mr Letwin told the Prime Minister: 'No one can say that you are being insufficiently radical, since you will be... trying out an extremely radical system in a significant part of the country.

'By the same token, no one can accuse you of being rash, since you will be reserving your options on domestic rates in England and Wales.

'If you are not willing to move to a pure residence charge in England and Wales immediately, you should not introduce a mixture of taxes, but should rather use the Scots as a trailblazer for the real thing.'
