A UN diplomat from Belgium has been left outraged after his family was thrown out of an upmarket restaurant because his wife was breastfeeding, according to reports.

Tom Neijens, 36, and his 34-year-old wife, Roseline Remans claim they were treated like 'terrorists' at the Metropolis Country Club on June 8 in White Plains, New York. 

The couple stopped at the golf club earlier this month and asked if they could eat in the dining room despite the fact they are not members.

Once the couple were seated on the terrace, Ms Remans then began to breastfeed the couple's daughter Luka.

The
couple claim that a female manager told them to leave because they were
upsetting other guests and to finish breastfeeding in the bathroom. 

When the couple protested, the Greenburgh police department were called according to reports.

The
couple claim the police had their hands on their weapons as they 
approached them and told other diners to clear the terrace.

The officer said that some people at the club thought Mr Neijens was a 'terrorist' because of the black backpack he was carrying, the New York Post reported.

When Mr Neijens revealed his government ID badge, he said that the officer's tone changed and more apologetically told them that the club had terrorism threats in the past. 

Metropolis Country Club had no comment on the allegations when contacted by MailOnline.

Breastfeeding is legal anywhere in New York State.

Mr Neijens is first secretary of the Belgium Mission to the UN and is moving to Ethiopia with his family next month.
