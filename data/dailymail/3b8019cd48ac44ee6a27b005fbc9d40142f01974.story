Five University staff members lived in the residence hall where a third-year University of Chicago student was found dead and decomposing in his room Saturday.

Nicholas Barnes, 20, last swiped his key card to enter Booth Hall on February 7, and was discovered eight days later, face down on his dorm room floor. 

While five staff members live in the dorm, university officials says they don't check up on the residents often.

Died alone: Third-year University of Chicago student Nicholas Barnes, 20, was discovered dead in his single dorm room Saturday and police say he had been decomposing for at least 72 hours

Mystery: Police said they do not suspect foul-play in the case, and will have to wait a month for toxicology reports to determine the cause of Barnes' untimely death

Record: The last time Barnes used his keycard to swipe into his dorm was February 7, more than a week before he was discovered dead

Resident Jordan Ginsburg doesn't understand how his fellow dorm mate's death could have gone unnoticed for so long.

'I don't understand how the people that 
live next door, and the people who were responsible for his wellbeing 
could have not seen that he has been gone for a week,' resident Jordan 
Ginsburg told ABC7.

Police spokesman Mike Sullivan says Nicholas Brastins Barnes, 20, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania had been dead for some time.

Chicago
 police found the body Saturday around 4:15pm 'in a decomposed state' 
after other students complained about a foul odor in Booth Hall where he
 lived.

He was found dead in the form room where he lived alone and pronounced dead at 4:50pm.

Barnes was majoring in Germanic studies and had last used his keycard to enter his dorm on February 7.

University officials said students don't always need to use their key cards when entering or exiting the building, depending on the time, so Barnes may have entered the building some time after that date.

Authorities believe Barnes had been dead for at least 72 hours.

Many students are disturbed by the fact that no one had raised the alarm about Barnes' absence from class.

'I think that if I didn't speak to any of my friends for a week they would start to notice. And the classes are small here too, so you'd think that someone in your class would notice,' one student told ABC7.

Booth Hall houses 253 students, including international students, all in single rooms.

The cause of death is under investigation.

Karen Warren Coleman, vice president for campus life and student services sought to reassure students living at International House, saying in an email that there was no evidence of foul play in the death of Barnes.

Officials say staff members are 'making every effort' to understand the circumstances around the death.

An autopsy performed on Sunday was inconclusive pending further toxicology testing.

University officials say Barnes’ family is planning a funeral in his hometown of Pittsburgh.

'Nick will be painfully missed. He was an excellent student, admired by faculty and peers alike,' said Susan Art, the dean of students.

Barnes had studied abroad in the school's Vienna program in the fall quarter of 2012. He was also involved with the school's literary publication Sliced Bread.

The university has made counselors available to students and a memorial will be held for Barnes tonight in the Ida Noyes library at 8pm.
