The North and South property divide is more evident than ever after house prices widened to a record high of more than £100,000.

A house in the South of England is now typically 74 per cent more expensive than one in the North. Prices in southern regions have risen by 6.1 per cent year-on-year and this increase is almost double the rate of the 3.1 per cent rise seen in the North.

The surge in the South is mainly down to price hikes in London, where a 10 per cent year-on-year growth marks the first time the capital has seen a double-digit increase since 2010.

The average price of a property in London is now £331,338.

Widening gap: The difference between the cost of homes in the north and south of England has continued to grow

The new figures from September show that all 13 regions in the UK have seen annual house price growth for the first time since 2007, according to Nationwide.

The figures are signs that 'the pick-up is becoming increasingly broad-based', the building society said.

But experts warned that a housing price bubble could emerge as demand for housing continues to far outstrip supply.

The annual rate of house price increases rose to 5 per cent across the country, marking the strongest uplift seen since July 2010.

Prices are also up by 0.9 per cent month-on-month, following a 0.7 per cent monthly increase seen in August, meaning the typical UK home is now worth £172,127.

Fears have been growing in recent months that Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, which have widened mortgage availability and encouraged more low-deposit lending, could be helping to stoke up a house price 'bubble', with people overstretching themselves.

But these concerns have been dismissed by lenders and by Chancellor George Osborne, who recently said that house prices have 'barely grown' outside London.

Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner warned that house building is still running at levels below what is needed to keep up with demand, which will fuel the upward pressure on prices.

He said the acceleration in house price growth from a subdued pace last year has been 'surprisingly quick', although prices are still way off their previous peaks in many areas of the UK.

He said: 'Overall, UK house prices are still around 8per cent below their 2007 highs. However, there is still significant regional variation, with prices in Scotland, Wales and the North of England around 12per cent to 14per cent below their previous peaks, while in many southern regions prices are 5per cent to 7per cent lower.

Boom time: London has seen the biggest rise in property prices than anywhere else in the country

'Only in London are prices at an all-time high, 8per cent above their previous peak.'

He
added: 'The risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply, 
affordability may become stretched. House price growth has been 
outstripping average earnings growth since the middle of the year, for 
the first time since late 2010.'

At the moment, 'ultra-low' interest rates are helping to support the affordability of mortgage payments, he said.

A typical mortgage payment for a first-time buyer is around 29 per cent of their take-home pay, which is in line with the long-term average.

On a regional level, the biggest increases continued to be felt in London, where prices have risen by 10 per cent year-on-year and at £331,338 typically they are not only at an all-time high but are sitting 8 per cent above their 2007 peak.

But the pick-up remains patchy. Manchester also saw a 10per cent 
increase in house prices over the last year and Newcastle recorded an 
8per cent rise - but at the other end of the spectrum, prices were down 
by 3 per cent annually in Carlisle and by 2per cent in Southampton.

After London, East Anglia saw the second highest annual increase in 
house prices at 6.6 per cent. House prices were up by 3.6 per cent in 
Wales year-on- year and by 2.2 per cent in Scotland.

Northern Ireland saw its first annual price rise since 2007, albeit a 
small 0.9 per cent increase, indicating that prices there are starting 
to stabilise, Nationwide said.

Northern Ireland has the lowest average house prices out of all the 
regions, at £108,671. The lowest year-on-year price increase was 
recorded in the North of England, at 0.2 per cent.
