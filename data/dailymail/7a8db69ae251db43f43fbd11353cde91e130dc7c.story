A snowstorm is tearing across the shores of the Northeast and left more than a thousand people on the islands off the coast of Massachusetts without power.

Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard were among the worst hit, with winds of up to 80 miles per hour whipping up to 10 inches of snow across the largely deserted streets.

Some meteorologists feared that what started as a late-season snow storm could accelerate into a Category 3 hurricane.

Whiteout: The island of Nantucket was hit with up to ten inches of snow and winds that reached up to 70 miles per hour on Wednesday

It has been dubbed a 'bombogenesis', a term meant to imply the storm will have the wrath of both a bomb and cyclonegenesis, or the beginning of a cyclone.

This category of storm draws its power from picking up speed while over water.

Less snow was expected farther to the north and east in Massachusetts, with the Boston area getting just an inch or two.

Schools
 across Cape Cod closed amid the 'white out' conditions, while ferry and
 flight service to the islands were cancelled as early as Tuesday night 
ahead of the Wednesday morning storm.

Dramatic jump: Ferries from the mainland were cancelled starting late Tuesday and the service disruption continued through Wednesday as water levels continued to rise

On Maine's eastern tip, Hancock and Washington counties could get 8 to 16 inches of snow. Governor Paul LePage ordered state offices in both counties closed Wednesday morning as flurries started falling.

Blizzard warnings were in effect in both Maine and Massachusetts. The Red Cross has opened a warming station at Nantucket High School.

The National Weather Service also warned of coastal flooding and significant beach erosion along the Massachusetts coast and wind gusts causing scattered power outages in eastern Maine.

The government agency's Boston office reported that waves in Nantucket exceeded 8 feet by 8am in the morning and continued to rise.

National Grid, the local power provider, reported that 1,566 customers in Nantucket had lost power by 7.30am. 

An update just before 10am reported that Boston Harbor recorded waves of more than 12 feet as a result of the wind.

Local blogger Holly Finigan told MailOnline that she was 'holed up' in her home on the island's eastern coast, and the beachfront town was now being pummeled by water.

'There are insane winds. There's still a lot of snow but it's kind of drifting because of the winds,' the Nantucket BlACKbook author told MailOnline Wednesday morning.

'There's easily zero visibility.'

Jason Graziadei reported
 that earlier reports of 70 mile per hour winds had been blown away by 
10am with new figures that put the number closer to 83 miles per hour in
 some of the more deserted areas of the island near Monomoy.

Those
 dangerous conditions extended into the mainland, as the National 
Weather Service- Boston urged all residents to stay inside and avoid any
 travel due to the blizzard warning.

The storm comes days after the official end of one of the snowiest winters on record. It began heading up the Interstate 95 corridor on Tuesday, dropping snowflakes onto Washington, D.C.'s budding cherry trees and dusting government buildings in northern Virginia. 

Almost 4 inches of snow was reported at Washington's Dulles International Airport and 1.7 inches at Reagan National Airport.

Ghost town: The port town of Hyannis was completely empty as all ferries running to and from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket have been suspended due to the storm

Deceptive: The stretches at the coastline did not appear to be drowned in snow but that was because the bustling winds in those areas stopped the snow from collecting

As
 the storm moved north, it dropped about 6 inches of snow in southern 
Delaware's Sussex County and blanketed parts of southern New Jersey, 
where six and a half inches of snow was reported in Cape May, five and a
 half inches in Middle Township and 4 inches at Atlantic City 
International Airport.

Taunton,
 Massachusetts-based meteorologist Matt Doody was unfazed by the 
prospect of more snow during a seemingly relentless season.

'Here in New England, we're generally used to dealing with weather like this,' he said early Wednesday.

Although
 spring began a week ago, it's not unusual to have storms so late in the
 year, said weather service spokesman Bill Simpson.

The Boston area got more than 2 inches of snow in an April storm last year and was blanketed with almost 2 feet the same month in 1997.

'I can't wait for it to warm up,' 20-year-old Dajuan Davis of Boston, a massage school student bundled up in a heavy jacket, said Tuesday.

'I'm from North Carolina. I'm not used to this cold weather.'

Where the snow falls and how much will depend on the storm's track. But wind and temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees below normal were expected to cover the Mid-Atlantic states and New England as the storm traveled from southern Virginia to Maine.
