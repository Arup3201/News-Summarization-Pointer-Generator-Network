Rest in peace: Diane Disney Miller, 79, daughter of Walt Disney, the only biological child of Walt Disney, died November 19, 2013 in Napa, California from injuries sustained in a fall

Diane Disney Miller, the well-respected philanthropist and daughter of Walt Disney, has died at her home in Napa, California. She was 79 years old.

Her death Tuesday was confirmed by The Walt Disney Co. The cause was complications from a fall in September, according to the Los Angeles Times.

‘As the beloved daughter of Walt Disney and one of his inspirations for creating Disneyland, she holds a special place in the history of The Walt Disney Co. and in the hearts of fans everywhere,’ Robert A. Iger, the company's president and CEO, said in a statement. ‘She will be remembered for her grace and generosity and tireless work to preserve her father's legacy.’

Miss Miller, the eldest and only biological daughter of Walt and Lillian Disney, was born December 18, 1933. In later life, she remembered her father as a man who was caring and patient with his children.

‘He'd take me and my sister Sharon to the merry-go-round at Griffith Park and stand there all day waiting until we were ready to go,’ Miller told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1998.

‘As he stood there, he kept thinking there should be more for parents and children to do together, and the idea for Disneyland was born.’

Disney Miller married professional football player Ron Miller in 1954. He went on to serve as the company's president in 1978 and chief executive a few years later.

Ron Miller was ousted from the company in 1984, paving the way for the new executive team of Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Frank Wells, who helped transform a sleepy theme park and animation company into an entertainment giant with hit movies, TV shows and new theme park attractions in Orlando, Florida, and Paris.

Miss Miller, a respected philanthropist, also played a key role in the completion of the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, a project started with a $50million gift from her mother. 

In 1997, she bucked project leaders like Richard Riordan, the mayor at the time, and the billionaire Eli Broad, who said Gehry's firm lacked the experience to execute the plans for the building's unusual curved polished steel design.

At a crucial point, Miller threatened to withhold the roughly $20million remaining of her mother's gift if Gehry was not kept on.

‘She was the turning point,’ Gehry told the Los Angeles Times in September.

'I wanted something that would bear my father’s name, that would come from his wealth but not be commercial,' she told the Times in September during a gala celebrating the 10th anniversary of the concert hall.

Miss Miller also founded the Walt Disney Family Museum, which opened in 2009 in San Francisco's Presidio, as a tribute to her family's legacy.

Her death comes one day after the 85th anniversary of Mickey Mouse’s 1928 debut in the short film ‘Steamboat Willie.’

Miller's younger adopted sister, Sharon, died of cancer in 1993. She is survived by her husband, Ronald, who owns the Silverado Vineyards Winery in Napa Valley, as well as seven children and 13 grandchildren.
