Prince Harry could celebrate his forthcoming 30th birthday with a ‘St Moritz-themed’ extravaganza at Kensington Palace, it has been revealed.

The prince, who turns 30 on September 15, is set to shun London’s nightclubs in favour of a private party with friends and family at the royal palace.

It is thought the royal will enjoy an intimate dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and 30 friends before celebrating with a lavish after-party.

One source said an empty drawing room, which used to house art classes, would be the central hub of the ‘chic’ party.

The room is set to be decked out with white leather sofas, drapes and décor in the style of St Moritz – the Swiss ski resort popular with the rich and famous.

According to The Sun, the source said the event reflected Prince Harry's newfound maturity.

‘At the moment the old drawing school is empty. Easels are resting in the corners. But it will get a stylish makeover. This is an important birthday for Harry and he's not going to fall out of a club late at night. He's keen to show that he has come of age,’ the source told the newspaper.

Prince William and Kate have reportedly taken over planning of the big birthday from Cressida Bonas, the former girlfriend of Prince Harry following their split in April.

As well as the private party, the prince is also set to receive £10million of his mother Diana's inheritance on his birthday.

The milestone means he will take control of half of a trust fund believed to be worth more than £20million.

He faces a £4million deduction due to inheritance tax, but experts say he could slash the bill if he gives some of the money to charity.

Princess Diana bequeathed the trust to the prince and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, who were 12 and 15 respectively at the time of her death in 1997.

Diana left a net estate of £12,966,022- after inheritance tax of £8,502,330 was deducted - but it is widely believed that with shrewd investment the fund has almost doubled.

Her estate comprised stocks and shares, jewellery, cash from her £17million divorce settlement, dresses and other personal belongings at her Kensington Palace apartment.

Diana stipulated that it would be held in trust to be shared equally between her two sons.

In her original will, drawn up in 1993, the princess had stipulated that both princes would be entitled to their entire share of the capital on reaching 25.

But details of the will were changed by a variation order granted by the High Court on Dec 19 1997 - three months after her premature death in a Paris car crash.

A spokesman for Kensington Palace declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

Meanwhile, although he may be deep in party plans for his fast-approaching 30th birthday, Prince Harry always has time for a spot of polo.
