The father of two young boys found dead at the family home had told his wife he was leaving her hours earlier, according to a friend.

Dawn Brown, 34, has been accused of killing her two sons and then hanging herself. Neighbors said she had been burdened with financial and legal troubles and that the family's electricity had been cut off for days.

Her husband Murphy Brown was believed to have told his wife of eight years that he wanted to end their marriage on Friday night before going out for the evening in Clearwater, 
Florida.

Devastating loss: Nine-year-old Zander and five-year-old Zayden were found dead at their home by their father

In the early hours of Saturday, police discovered Mrs Brown and her children, nine-year-old Zander and five-year-old Zayden, dead in the suburban home after receiving a call from Mr Brown.

Friend and neighbor William Lavold told Tampa Bay Online that Mr Brown, 36, was distraught.

He said: 'He can't function. He can't figure it out. He's done in. He's really done in.'

Dawn Brown was charged last year with welfare
fraud and had faced foreclosure on the family home several times. A neighbor was supplying them with electricity via an extension cord. 

Authorities believe she murdered the children sometime on Friday night before hanging herself. The boys' cause of death will be released after an autopsy today. 

A neighbor of the family, Nichole Bell, told the paper that the two brothers attended McMullen-Booth Elementary School with her son, who was one of Zander’s best friends.

Awful: Police found the three bodies shortly after 2am Saturday; authorities did not give a possible motive for the killing

'I can't believe it. She was so interested in her kids' educations,' Ms Bell said.

Bell told the paper that her son and Zander got in a fight at the bus stop on Friday morning and had to go to a guidance counselor when they arrived at school.

Mr Lavold said that he was like a godfather to the young boys and that they had planned to go out on his boat at the weekend.

Lavold said that he received a text about trouble at the home around 3am but only saw it three hours later and rushed to the house, by which time the mother and boys had died.

Authorities did not give a possible motive for the killings.
