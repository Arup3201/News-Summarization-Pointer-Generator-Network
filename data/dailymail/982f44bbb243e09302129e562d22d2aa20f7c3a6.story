Eight police officers were rushed to hospital this morning after raiding a suspected drugs den and being knocked out - with a cocktail of petrol and heroin.

The police burst into the house in Bordesley Green, Birmingham at around 12am this morning to uncover a £250,000 haul of drugs.

But within seconds they were vomiting after being hit with the toxic vapour from suspected heroin mixed with petrol that was poured onto the carpet.

Police said they were looking into whether the mixture was an attempt to use it as a 'weapon' when it was poured onto the carpet.

West Midlands Police said they attended the address with officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), who executed a search warrant in relation to illegal drugs.

They kicked in the door at around midnight and arrested three men, aged 21, 27 and 34 on suspicion of conspiracy to possess a controlled drug with intent to supply.

Officers said they seized a 'very large quantity' of suspected Class A drugs with an approximate street value of around a quarter of a million pounds.

While the arrests were being made, the officers were overpowerd by the unknown substance, which caused sickness and breathing difficulties.

In total 11 people, consisting of eight police officers and the three who were arrested, were taken to Heartlands Hospital.

police custody, where they are being dealt with by SOCA officers.

Firefighters in gas masks scoured the home after the incident but found that there was no further risk posed by the substance.

Parts of the area are still cordoned off and a number of road restrictions are in place while forensic examinations continue.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said it was not known why the petrol was poured onto the floor mixed with what was thought to be heroin.

He said: 'We don't know if this was a mixture designed to be used as a weapon or if the heroin was being mixed with the petrol as part of the drug-makingprocess.'

The Force’s Incident Manager, Chief Inspector Lee Wharmby, said: 'Police officers face threats on a daily basis and, on occasions, criminals will use extreme measures to resist arrest.

'What happened overnight demonstrates the ongoing commitment and bravery of officers as they work to keep our streets safe.

'Events such as this always raise concern in communities, but I want to be clear that this is about drugs alone and not connected to terrorism.

'A long term operation, ''No Deal'', is already underway targeting drug dealing across Birmingham, during which efforts have been focused on two organised crime groups responsible for the supply of cocaine and heroin in the local area.

'Following a long-term covert operation and a series of co-ordinated raids during March 2012, a total of 39 individuals were arrested for various drugs offences, with 26 already sentenced for supplying drugs.'
