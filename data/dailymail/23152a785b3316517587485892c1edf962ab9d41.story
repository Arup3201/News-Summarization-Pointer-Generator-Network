It was exactly one year ago today that Darwin the Japanese macaque was found wandering a Toronto Ikea parking lot dressed in a fashionable shearling coat and a diaper.

The Internet almost collapsed under the weight of the numerous meme's created in honor of him as he became universally known as the IKEA Monkey.

Now 19 months-old and living at the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario, this is the first time that Darwin has been seen since last year - as he passes his time alone playing with his Curious George stuffed toy as he 'learns to be a monkey again.'

Twelve months on: Darwin the Japanese macaque is making progress at the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario since he was catapulted to global fame as the Ikea Monkey

Up until the day that he escaped his human mom, Yasmin Kakhuda, Darwin had spent most days dressed in snazzy clothes and a diaper, traveling everywhere with her.

Taken into the custody of the sanctuary the day he was found inside the IKEA store, Darwin's rehabilitation has been tough.

'When he came to us, he was lacking in confidence and unsure how to act around other monkeys,' said Izzy Hirji, chair of the sanctuary’s board of directors in an interview with the Toronto Star.

'Through being able to see and interact with the other guys, he’s growing into a healthy, confident adolescent.'

Upon losing her beloved monkey, Nakhuda launched a lawsuit the very week he was taken, alleging the sanctuary was 'illegally detaining' Darwin.

However, a judge ruled in September that Darwin should remain at the sanctuary and not with the real estate lawyer who called the Japanese macaque her 'son'.

'I love him and I want him back. This is injustice,' she told the Star last Wednesday.

'If I really felt in my heart that justice was served, then I would let it go.

'I’m not doing this to get my picture in the paper, she said. 'I just need to win him back. I just need him to be back home.'

Sadly since his re-housing, Darwin has not be introduced to other primates at the sanctuary because they didn't want to run the risk of being liable to Kakhuda if he was attacked.

However, that decision may cost Darwin the opportunity to ever safely interact with members of his own species.

'Currently, we’re not sure about that,' said Hirji.

'Of course, we would love to have a partner for him to interact with.'

However, in one sign of progress, Darwin is able to see other macaques and has been mimicing their noises.

'The first time we heard him make a distinct macaque vocalization, it was a joyous moment for us,' he said.

Darwin bathes and plays with his Curious George toy, even taking him for a bath and shows him where to drink and grooms it.

Having grown one-and-a-half times his size from year ago, Darwin loves playing with his handlers - on his fire pole, slide and pool.

However, the cheeky monkey is still learning to behave.

'He’ll throw temper tantrums when somebody turns their back on him, because he’s used to being the centre of attention,' said Hirji.

In December last year, Darwin captured worldwide attention after he somehow let himself out of a parked car and ambled around the Ikea parking lot dressed in a stylish shearling coat and diaper.

In September, Ontario Superior Court Judge Mary Vallee ruled that while the monkey may have worn clothing and slept in his former owner's bed, he is still a wild animal and therefore should not be returned to her.

Heavy burden: Nakhuda explained that caring for a monkey is very demanding because he needs to be bottle fed and that Darwin has 'anxiety disorders'

Nakhuda's lawyer's office said she would not be commenting on the decision that left her distraught.

Allegations she physically abused the monkey were dropped earlier in the year.

Nakhuda, a mother of two, has been trying to get back her pet ever since he was taken from her in December after escaping his cage and wandering round Ikea's parking lot.

Darwin was taken to Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary where he has been living ever since was picked up at the Ikea in Toronto.

The sanctuary alleged that Nakhuda, a real estate lawyer, was an unfit mother who would beat the monkey with a spoon and even threatened to have its teeth removed.

She denied these allegations and the animal sanctuary has since dropped them, reportedly in an effort to avoid a lengthy trial.

Nakhuda said the Japanese macaque was illegally taken from her after the Ikea incident.

She claimed she misunderstood the forms she said that relinquished her ownership of Darwin as part of an emotional testimony in a Canada court in June.

‘I think when I had my two children I didn't have time to mother them. I was more focused on building my practice,’ Nakhuda said on the stand, according to CTV.

‘Having Darwin ... was like the chance to experience motherhood again.’

At this trial Nakhuda reportedly broke down repeatedly and told the court Darwin has ‘anxiety disorders’ and that she took him everywhere she went.

‘I treated him like a son. It sounds bizarre to some people, but that’s how we treated him,’ Nakhuda said.

On the other side of the debate were Toronto Animal Supervisors who contended that Darwin could be a threat to public safety.

Toronto Animal Services supervisor Carl Bandow also testified to the fact that it is illegal to keep a monkey within the city of Toronto, but that Darwin’s case has prompted the city to consider changing the law.

Nakhuda said the monkey was near her at all times, including while she slept and showered.

‘At the beginning, I was told that was the best for him because generally, monkeys live off the back of the mom,’ she said.

‘He always had to be within my view,’ she continued, adding that he would ‘get into a panic attack’ the moment she was out of sight.

In multiple YouTube videos, Nakhuda posted her daily interactions with Darwin, who could be seen playing at the office, dressed up as a devil with horns for Halloween and brushing his teeth along with his owner.

‘He is more than a handful: needs to be baby bottle fed night time and needs at least 3 diaper change a day,’ Nakhuda wrote in the comments.

‘He has to be with me all the time which means he goes with me to the office, sleeps with me, eats with me, showers with me, goes shopping with me . . . it is more than a human baby so yes, not everyone can handle a baby monkey. He is now 6 months old only and is expected to be around 4 feet tall.’
