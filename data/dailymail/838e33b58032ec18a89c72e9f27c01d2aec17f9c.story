At the end of last year, following the World Cup draw,  FA chairman Greg Dyke attempted to clarify his infamous cut-throat gesture.

‘If you can get out of the group, you’re four games from winning it,’ he said. ‘And let’s not kid ourselves — we have a chance.’

In the end, after a depressing defeat against Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday, we realised we never had a chance at all. On Friday night we received confirmation.

Under fire: but Greg Dyke has backed Roy Hodgson despite England's dismal showing in Brazil

Best manager experienced?

Fabio Capello. Not easy to get along with, but a serial winner at the highest level.

Favourite England moment?

1986 World Cup when Gary Lineker thinks he has levelled against Argentina. You realise then what it’d mean to win it.

Best player in your lifetime?

Ashley Cole. The one full-back to get the better of Cristiano Ronaldo for club and country.

The sooner the FA and everybody associated with England realise that every country in the world loves putting one over on us the better.

When you bounce into South America with your bling and boot deals, your oxygen tents and 80 staff (including the players), you will attract some attention. Thursday evening was another brutal mugging.

When Luis Suarez pulls on the colours of Los Charruas and belts out Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba, he is singing it for the 3.3million lining the streets of Montevideo.

Suarez, who scored twice, would rather die for his country than lose to England. Ask him and he will tell you. There are scores of other players at this World Cup — playing for Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico or Colombia — who feel the same.

National pride: Luis Suarez would die for his country rather than lose to England

Name one England player of whom you could say the same. Go on, name one.

When Hodgson claimed Suarez would have to do it at a World Cup to be bracketed in the world-class category last weekend, he simply added to his motivation.

Suarez, Van Persie, Muller, Robben, Sanchez, Neymar and Messi are elite players. All of them have  delivered here. These boys grow in the tunnel when they slip on the national team’s jersey.

Many of Uruguay’s players are street kids, antagonised by the money England’s players earn. At 19, Raheem Sterling was the lowest-paid England player in Thursday’s starting XI. He earns £2.5m a year before endorsements.

Huge wage: Raheem Sterling is the lowest paid player in the England squad at £2.5m per year

Rickie Lambert, who came on as a substitute, was raking in £55,000 a week at Southampton. He is likely to have received a pay rise at Liverpool. Good luck, because we would all do the same given half a chance, but big dosh is a big issue in international football.

After Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo blew for the final whistle in Sao Paulo, England’s players couldn’t swap shirts quick enough with the opposition. Yes, it’s an accepted ritual, but at least have the decency to let the scale of what has happened sink in before hunting for souvenirs.

We are weary of golden caps in big, glass presentation boxes and arguing about whether Ashley Cole should have been at this tournament (he should have, by the way).

When you crow as much as the FA does about the best-laid plans — a week’s warm-weather training in Portugal, a flag-waving send-off at Wembley and a week in Miami —you’re asking for trouble. Seven days into England’s World Cup, they are out.

Early exit: Danny Welbeck, Rooney and Daniel Sturridge trudge off

England’s coaching staff can put out all the white cones they like for the warm-up and it is just a tick in the box. It is no substitute for steel and strength.

In Manaus, England’s players were put through a complicated pre-match procedure involving all manner of exercises. In the other half of the pitch, the Italy players were casually firing shots into  Salvatore Sirigu. It was their way of shedding tension after weeks of preparation and it worked.

If we are told one more time about the ‘positives’ of losing our opening two group games, we may as well accept we are done and dusted at the highest level.

Gary Neville, who has the best interests of the country at heart, claimed the Italy game was the best England performance in years.

If playing fast and loose is the way forward, we will need to start scoring four goals a game with a defence as poorly organised as this.

We have been told many times that this tournament was designed with the development of young players in mind. Can you imagine the Chile, Argentina or Brazil coach trying that on? They would be  marmalised and replaced.

When the players and FA start trotting out the line that there is no expectation on this squad, it is an excuse for failure.

England’s players didn’t know what they were fighting for. Was it to get out of the group? To win the damn thing? Heroic failure?

Gutted: England fans who paid thousands to see the three Lions were badly let down

The FA are so paranoid that they wouldn’t even confirm a minor injury to Danny Welbeck. Apparently, confirmation could damage the team’s chances. Get real.

When Gianluigi Buffon, a World Cup winner and genuine great, turned his ankle in training, Cesare Prandelli released a short statement. Little things, for sure, but one of many little things that paint a picture of disarray.

After more than a decade covering the England team, this once-in-a-lifetime World Cup experience is over already. It’s sickening.
