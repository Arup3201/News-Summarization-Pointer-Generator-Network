Their bewildered faces give some clue to the devastation all around them.

But these cats and dogs are symbols of hope amidst the devastation wrought all around them by Hurricane Isaac on the Gulf Coast.

They are among 181 pets from shelters being shipped to Texas out of harms' way as the elements continue to batter states.

The SPCA took 87 cats and 60 dogs from New Orleans in Louisiana after Isaac lashed the area earlier this week leaving a trail of carnage in its wake.

A further 34 cats from the Humane Society in Gulfport, Mississippi were also transferred to North Texas where they will be safe from storms.  

The pets will be offered up for adoption to new homes. Their places will also be filled with hundreds more creatures expected to brought in to rescue shelters after Isaac rattled the coast with winds swirling up to 80 miles per hour.

Maura Davis, the vice president of communications for the SPCA of Texas, said many of the animals were frightened by the storm and that they would be 'nurtured'.

She added that there was a 'massive public outcry' after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to make sure that animals were properly taken care of.

They developed the transfer system in partnership with centres in Texas to ensure that no pets were allowed to roam the streets.

She added that centres in New Orleans 
were now 'stretched to the limit' after tghe hurricane. There are around
300 animals at SPCA centres in Texas.

She added: 'All our thoughts are with everyone down on the coast. It's such a scary time for people and animals.'

Since
striking land and devastating thousands of homes, Isaac has been 
downgraded to a Tropical Storm as its winds dropped to 70 mph. With the 
storm creeping along at just 6 mph, as many as 24 inches of rainfall 
were expected in some areas.

The storm threatened to flood towns in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana and leaving 730,000 without power. In some part of Louisiana, power could be out for as long as a week.

In the first test of the Louisiana levees since the devastating hurricane of 2005, flood water topped a nine-foot-high floodbank in Plaquemines, just 60 miles southeast of New Orleans. It was not one of the levees strengthened following Katrina.

As the authorities made preparations 
to deal with the large numbers of pets made homeless, search-and-rescue 
operations around New Orleans resumed today. Isaac, a slow-moving 
Category 1 hurricane when it hit, was expected to weaken into a tropical
depression on Thursday.

But
it left a soggy mess across a widespread area and could still bring 
heavy rain and floods as it moves over the central United States - where
rain is badly needed - in the next few days.  

Oil
production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was expected to start ramping up 
again, after nearly grinding to a halt as Isaac closed in on Louisiana 
on Tuesday. Most energy facilities, including key coastal refineries, 
seemed to escape any Isaac-related damage although benchmark Brent crude
was trading slightly higher on Thursday at about $113.25 a barrel.

Multibillion-dollar defenses built to protect New Orleans itself, after it was ravaged by Katrina almost exactly seven years ago, passed their first major test, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

But massive rains and storm surge from
the Gulf of Mexico inundated low-lying communities outside the federal 
flood containment system protecting the city, forcing the evacuation of 
thousands of people from their homes and dramatic rooftop rescue 
operations.

The hardest hit 
area was Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans, where floodwaters
overtopped at least one levee on Wednesday and left many homes under 
about 12 feet (3.6 meters) of water.

Dozens
were plucked from the roofs of their houses in Plaquemines by local 
boatmen after earlier deciding they could ride out what compared with 
Katrina seemed like a small storm.

Parish
President Billy Nungesser said U.S. Army National Guard troops and 
local sheriff's office officials were going house to house through the 
area on Thursday to ensure that there were no deaths or injuries.

Clearing weather was permitted the use of military helicopters, mostly UH-60 Blackhawks, to aid in the operation.

In St. John the Baptist Parish, northwest of the city, about 3,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes before dawn on Thursday due to storm surges from Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, authorities said.

Local media also reported major flooding in the town of Slidell, northeast of New Orleans.

'We've been working all through the night. We'll continue working all day,' Lieutenant Colonel Mike Kazmierzak of the Louisiana National Guard told CNN.

Staff Sergeant Denis Ricou, a Louisiana National Guard spokesman, said about 5,800 troops had been deployed due to Isaac and the number could rise to over 8,000 in the coming days.

City officials announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Wednesday to help prevent any return of the looting that occurred in New Orleans in the days after Katrina struck in 2005.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned that the punishment for a looting conviction is harsh - a mandatory three years' hard labor.

'If you loot, you'll wear an orange suit,' Landrieu told a news conference.

About a dozen looting-related arrests were reported in the city by Thursday morning but the streets were unusually quiet, littered with downed branches, trees and pieces of roofing material.

Power remained out through most of the city, while in the historic French Quarter, a few people were out taking down the boards they had nailed up over store windows.

Mark Wallace, 52, had come out to check on his store, Fancy Boutique.

'This one just took forever,' Wallace said of the slow-moving storm, which has brought rain to New Orleans since late Tuesday. 'Usually they blow through and are done with.'

Wayne Overton, 50, a longshoreman, had come out to inspect a large, fallen tree in front of his home that had knocked down power lines.

'This one lasted a while. It was scary,' Overton said, noting that the storm had damaged the roof of his home, near the city's port. 'There's going to be a lot of clean up to do around here.'

As the focus on Isaac shifted from the coast, many in its projected path further north have been praying that it will bring rain desperately needed to ease a drought in the central states, where summer crops are drying up and many rivers and dams are critically low.

Isaac never came close to the power of Katrina, which was a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale when it smashed into New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005.

But U.S. President Barack Obama still declared the impact on Louisiana and Mississippi major disasters and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts.

City officials also said Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, which closed late on Monday, would remain shut on Thursday until repairs can be done to the damaged lines that supply it with power.

A tow-truck driver died early Thursday after a tree fell on his cab while he was trying to move a large tree from a main street in Picayune, a town in Pearl River County in southern Mississippi near the Louisiana border, according a spokesperson for the Pearl River Emergency Management Agency.

Together with an unconfirmed death in a Louisiana apartment fire, it was the only fatality blamed on Isaac so far.
