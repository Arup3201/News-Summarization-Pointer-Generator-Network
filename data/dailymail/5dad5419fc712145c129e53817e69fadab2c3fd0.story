A bad break-up can be tough enough, but what if it was captured by Google Street View cameras and immortalized on the web?

That's the dilemma of one woman, who - after being dumped by her boyfriend several years ago - can be seen beside her car with a pile of her belongings, according to several internet postings.

The image was posted on Reddit and the photo-sharing site Imgur with the caption: 'Google Streetview captures the glorious moment when my buddy kicks his now ex-gf out of his house.'

Dumped: This Google Streetview image posted on Reddit and Imgur on Thursday shows a woman who was purportedly kicked out by her now ex-boyfriend

In it, the downtrodden female 
clutches a 
Victoria's Secret bag as she stands next to curbside bags and boxes. 
Among the items is a beach chair and what appears to be a giant stuffed 
dog.

The identity of the woman is not 
known, but the photo was snapped somewhere in Southern California, 
according to the poster, who declined to provide additional details to 
'protect the identities and privacy of my friend and his ex.'

In a separate Reddit post, the user said: 'My buddy no longer lives in the same town as me but I became aware of this recently by his brother who is currently my coworker.

'I find this even more hilarious because I actually knew this girl, as me and my then-gf, her and my buddy used to double date occasionally.'

while a dog sprawls on the driveway

Bizarre: A man with a horse head was caught by a Google 
Streetview car in Aberdeen, Scotland. Horseboy, as he is now known, became an 
internet sensation after he was spotted by someone searching for an 
optician

It's one of many unusual images that has hit the web since Google launched Street View in 2007.

Over the years, a seemingly naked man in the trunk of a car was seen in Germany, while a man wearing a horse mask was spotted in Scotland.

Last month, a photographer who displayed Google Street View images of prostitutes in his gallery has been nominated to win a $46,000 art prize in London.

Mishka Henner, 36, searched lurid internet forums to find out where sex workers can be found and then looked up their locations using Google's street cameras.

His collection of screenshots has now earned him one of four nominations for the prestigious Deutsche BÃ¶rse photography award.

Mr Henner found the locations thanks to tip-offs on various internet forums.
