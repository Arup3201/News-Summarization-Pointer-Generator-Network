Peanuts voice actor Peter Robbins, pictured with a Charlie Brown character in 2008, has been arrested on suspicion of stalking and making a threat to cause death or great bodily injury

The voice actor who portrayed Charlie Brown in the Peanuts shows has been arrested on charges of making threats to cause death and stalking, it emerged today.

Peter Robbins was held on Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, the largest land border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman Angelica de Cima said.

She told U-T San Diego that a background 
check yielded a warrant against Robbins from the San Diego County 
sheriff's department.

A sheriff's spokeswoman said she did not have details about the warrant.

The 56-year-old is set to be arraigned today on counts of making a threat to cause death or great bodily injury and of stalking.

His manager has declined to comment.

Robbins, who voiced Charlie Brown for TV specials A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, recently called the forthcoming Peanuts movie pointless and a 'horrible idea'.

Speaking in October, he accused 20th Century Fox of lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original televised version of the popular cartoon.

The new Peanuts film is expected to hit the silver screen in November 2015 with a screenplay written by the cartoon's creator Charles M Schulz's son and grandson.

Mr Robbins, 56, famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark 'AAUGH!' screams of frustration in the 1960s, said: 'What's the point?

'If
it's to reintroduce the character of Charlie Brown to a new generation,
it's been passed on successfully for 46 years. That's the beauty of it.

Comparing
the new flick to a 'knock-off band' he added: 'If they were so creative
why don't they come up with some new characters?

'It
just seems to me they're trying to steal the thunder of these great 
classics, and from what I can tell, they're not qualified. It's perfect 
the way it is.'

As a child actor, Robbins became famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark screams of frustration in A Charlie Brown Christmas (above) and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown

The 2015 release will coincide with the 65th anniversary of the comic strip and the 50th anniversary of A Charlie Brown Christmas.

The son of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz, Craig Schulz, as well as his grandson, Bryan Schulz,Â  worked on the screenplay together.

The comic strip ran from October 2, 1950 to February 13, 2000, and in its prime reached 355 million people in 75 countries.
