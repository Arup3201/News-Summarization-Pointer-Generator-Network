Russian men caught paying for sex could soon be given the choice of either going to jail or marrying the prostitute, under draft legislation being considered in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg. 

The unusual proposal, which has been put forward by Local MP Olga Galkina, is aimed at curbing prostitution in the country's second city.

Ms Galkina said: 'If it is adopted, clients of prostitutes will have the choice between paying a fine of 100,000 roubles (£1,450) or serving a 15 day jail term.'

'They can avoid going to jail if they agree to marry the prostitute.'

The plan comes from the same city authority that pioneered Russia's controversial laws forbidding the promotion of gay sex to under age children.

Galinka said her bill was a response to a proposal to make prostitution a criminal offence which was drafted by anti- gay politician Vitaly Milonov.

Local reports says the exemption allowing punters to tie the knot with sex workers is a 'populist' measure but Galkina insists she is serious about tackling the problem.

Currently, men who pay for sex face no penalties under Russian laws.

Galkina, 33, a mother-of-one, set up a tourism company after graduating from St Petersburg Institute of Management and Economics.
