It was a penalty, there is no conspiracy theory and Jose Mourinho is finally being seen for what he is; an excellent coach who is a graceless and immature man who needs to learn how to lose.

In football there are some things which are indisputable, some fouls which stand out as obvious and red cards which nobody can deny – Ramires' assault on Sebastian Larsson in this game being a case in point.

However there are a lot of incidents which fall into the ‘grey area’ category and no matter how much they are debated agreement cannot be found. Sunderland’s penalty was just such an incident.

Down: Cesar Azpilicueta fouls Jozy Altidore to give away a penalty during Sunderland's win against Chelsea

Tough call: Jozy Altidore and Cesar Azpilicueta collided in the area with referee Mike Dean pointing to the spot

Cesar Azpilicueta slid in to challenge Jozy Altidore and made no contact with the ball. The striker’s foot came down on Azpilicueta’s outstretched leg which caused him to lose balance and go to ground.

In such circumstances and with the game close to ending I used to try and err on the side of caution and only award stone-wall penalty kicks. However if an assistant flags and indicates a penalty then you support him. Mike Dean followed that protocol after his assistant, Stuart Burt, did exactly that.

Unpunished: Mike Dean was just a few feet away but his attention appeared to be elsewhere

Making a case: Larsson speaks to referee Mike Dean about the incident

The more times I look at the replay the harder I find it to state unequivocally what the correct decision should be.

At the end of the game Mourinho thought he was being ‘clever’ by complimenting Dean and then his boss, Mike Riley. All listening knew what he meant by the comments but the FA will struggle to charge on ‘interpretation’ of words and rising above such puerile antics is the best way to deal with them.

Mourinho must now contemplate the rest of the domestic season without the rash Ramires as it is clear from replays that despite his position Dean was looking away as the Brazilian struck his opponent.

As for Rui Faria the FA MUST act very strongly and show that such disgraceful behaviour is completely unacceptable.
