While most of us are still recovering from the dreaded, stress-inducing Christmas shopping spree of 2013, one million savvy Brits have already snapped up their presents for 2014.

The canny shoppers have used the January sales to bag themselves half-price handbags, slashed shoes and discount denim, research reveals.

The new study found that one in fifty present planners will have completed their entire gift shopping for the 2014 festive season by the end of the month.

Savvy shoppers: One million Brits are using the January sales to get their Christmas shopping done eleven months early

And it's the shoppers in Coventry who are the most likely to have bought their goods in the sales period.

Over a quarter of shoppers (27 per cent) say they will buy a few sale items to stash away until December 25 because the bargains are too good to miss.

Data has revealed that handbag sales are up a third already this month, with a higher proportion being purchased by males, with top brands including YSL, Celine and Dolce and Gabbana (lucky wives!).

Slendertones are also proving very popular after the Christmas, and many women are even buying it for their men, reports the survey.

Gentleman’s classic leather strap watches have been extremely popular already this year for both men and women and definitely a trend to monitor throughout the year, say researchers.

It's worth it: The average shopper will save around £84 by snapping up sales items

And it seems that being keen is paying off: the average shopper claims they will save an average of £84 on their total gift expenditure by hitting the sales.

A spokesperson for SecretSales.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'You can definitely snap up some great bargains in the January sales and hide them away for Christmas presents later this year.

'Our advice would be to invest in classic, timeless pieces – from jewellery to jackets - to ensure that your gift isn’t outdated in 12 months time.'
