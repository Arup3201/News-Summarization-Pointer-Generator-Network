Ukip has suspended the star of its first European election TV broadcast after it emerged that he condemned Ed Miliband as ‘not a real Brit’, suggested Africans should ‘kill themselves off’ and said Islam was an evil religion with a paedophile prophet.

Andre Lampitt also said he loathed the charity Oxfam and welcomed Aids outbreaks in Africa, saying: ‘Inner peace will come when Aids does what it should and reduce  African density.’

Like party leader Nigel Farage, he said he admired Russian leader Vladimir Putin, adding: ‘At least Putin loves his country. David Cameron does not love Britain, he loves the EU.’

Zimbabwean decorator Andre Lampitt appeared in the Ukip party political broadcast to complain about the impact of immigration in Britain

Ukip said it was ‘shocked’ by his 
views, which will embarrass the party as it prepares for local elections
 next month – with Mr Lampitt standing as a councillor in Merton, South 
London.

The builder, who 
describes himself as ‘born British in Rhodesia’, was one of five 
supporters hand-picked to appear in a prime-time television campaign 
starting this week.

He was 
featured in the broadcast criticising immigration from the EU, saying: 
‘Since the lads from Eastern Europe are prepared to work for a lot less 
than anybody else, I’ve found it a real struggle.’

Yesterday,
 the party said it was suspending him after discovering he had expressed
 ‘repellent’ views in a series of potentially unlawful messages on 
Twitter over recent months.

In
 one tweet he claimed that Islam was not a religion and called it an 
‘evil organisation respecting a prophet who as a pedo.’[sic]

He added: ‘All Muslims need to leave Europe... or denounce their pathetic satanic religion.’

His appearance had been part of a major drive by the party to present a more professional image

Another message insisted: ‘Most Nigerians are generally bad people... I  grew up in Africa and dare anyone to prove me wrong.’

He
 suggested Africans should be ‘left to ‘kill themselves off’ and 
suggested people should ‘get over’ slavery, which he said was an ‘act of
 war’.

'His racist views might even make the BNP wince with embarrassment'

Tim Farron, Lib Dem president

Condemning the Labour leader, he said: ‘Miliband is not a real Brit. I  hope he never gets to be PM! He was only born here.’

In another message, he said Mr Miliband, whose father Ralph was born in Belgium to Polish parents, was ‘Polish, not British’.

He
 also suggested examination of statistics on rape would reveal a racial 
bias among attackers, and in another message declared: ‘Enoch Powell was
 right’.

A Ukip spokesman said: ‘We are deeply shocked that Mr Lampitt has expressed such repellent views.

‘His membership of the party has been suspended immediately pending a full disciplinary process.’

However,
 it was not clear whether Mr Lampitt can be removed from the party’s 
list of council candidates in Merton, because nominations closed 
yesterday.

The timing of the
 row is unfortunate for Mr Farage, who has this week rejected claims 
from some Labour MPs that his party’s latest election billboards on 
immigration are racist.

Ukip had suggested its candidates would be put 
through more rigorous checks following a series of controversies over 
the views of some on race, gay marriage and other issues.

It
 faces questions about how it failed to check messages posted over 
several months and available for all to see on Mr Lampitt’s Twitter 
page.

Last night his account appeared to have been deleted and he could 
not be reached.

Lib Dem 
president Tim Farron said: ‘I cannot believe Ukip did not check the 
comments of this man before they used him in their broadcast.

The row is a blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who spent the day campaigning in Knutsford in Cheshire

‘His
 racist views might even make the BNP wince with embarrassment. A week 
after the French National Front opened their arms to Ukip, with comments
 like these it’s easy to see why they did.

‘Ukip might wrap themselves in the flag, but these comments are deeply offensive to anyone with decent British values.’

'We are deeply shocked that Mr Lampitt has expressed such repellent views'

Ukip spokesman

Mr
 Farage promised to eliminate ‘Walter Mittys’ from his candidate list 
after Ukip defence spokesman Godfrey Bloom - one of his closest allies -
 quit following outbursts in which he described foreign nations as 
‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women as ‘sluts’.

The Ukip leader said he would ensure only ‘reliable, steady, solid people’ could run for election.

Labour's Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described Mr Lampitt's tweets as nasty and divisive.

She
 said on Twitter: 'Appalling tweets from Ukip member chosen to front 
campaign. Ukip should reflect very carefully on the way they encourage nasty 
divisive views.'
