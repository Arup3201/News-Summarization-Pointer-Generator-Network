Wearing a mini-skirt showing off her enviably slim figure, you’d expect all eyes to be glued on Pippa Middleton.

But the royal’s attention-grabbing outfit was upstaged by that of her stockbroker boyfriend at the weekend.

Nico Jackson, 35, was sporting bright red chinos as he walked hand-in-hand with the party planner-turned columnist in Chelsea on Friday night.

Fancy a stroll? Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson enjoy a night out in Chelsea

Pippa, 29, wore a crew-necked top and short skirt and held a black clutch bag to compliment her strappy stiletto shoes. Her hair was loosely swept back from her face.

She was pictured laughing and joking with Mr Jackson, a grammar-school educated son of a retailer working in the London office of Deutsche Bank.  

He topped off his attire with an unbuttoned shirt and a black jacket. 

The Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister has dated a string of aristocratic men in recent years, but has told friends Mr Jackson is ‘the one’.

The couple have not been shy about displaying their affection and have been spotted canoodling onseveral occasions. It is thought they may announce their engagement within months according to friends

Pippa is expected to announce her engagement within months, according to friends – and has been delaying the news out of deference to Kate, who gave birth to her first child last month.

A close friend of the lovestruck couple said in July: ‘An engagement is definitely on the cards.’

The couple have not been shy about displaying their affection and have been spotted canoodling on several occasions.

While she attended £31,000-a-year Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, he was educated at The Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and lived with his parents and sister Nina in a red-brick terraced house. 

But after graduating from London’s Kingston University, Mr Jackson made his fortune as a stockbroker. 

Pippa has previously dated suitors from the upper echelons of society, including investment banker James Matthews and financier and former England cricketer Alex Loudon.
