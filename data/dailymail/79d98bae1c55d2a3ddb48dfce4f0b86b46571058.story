With plenty of sunshine, blue skies and mild temperatures, winter seems a world away.

But rewind 12 months and the picture was about as different as it could be with early snow and freezing conditions.

This time last year, Hannah Walker was having fun sledging in her garden and building a snowman in Portchester in Hampshire. But this year the five-year-old is watering the geraniums and relaxing in the unusually warm weather that has been with us for weeks.

And on the North Yorkshire moors, 
regulars at the Lion Inn in Blakey Ridge are enjoying Caribbean 
cocktails in sharp contrast to last year when they faced the ‘ultimate 
lock-in’ after the pub became buried under 16ft of snow.

What a difference a year makes: Hannah May, 5, sits in the garden in Portchester, Hampshire, watering the geraniums today, right. A year ago she was out on her sledge

One year on: Walkers dress up in hats and coats - but there is no snow in sight at the Lion Inn

Two
guests and five workers were stranded by snowdrifts which covered the 
road and buried cars outside, cutting off any escape from the 
16th-century freehouse, which, at an elevation of 1,325ft (404m), 
advertises itself as the country's fourth-highest pub.

Co-owner Paul Crossland had to put a warning on the Lion Inn's website urging customers not to attempt to reach the pub.

He said: 'This year it's a very different story.

'We're pretty high up and pretty exposed up here but the snow still caught us a little by surprise last year.

'It all seemed to fall within the space of one evening's shift - then the drifts really cut us off.

'We were stuck until about December 
6, when we still had plenty of food and drink left but had just about 
run out of Calor gas for the heating.

'It was fun at first but I prefer this. There's only so much painting and decorating and cleaning you can do.

'I'd rather be out here with a cocktail than breaking my back with a snow shovel in my hands.'

Bright autumn day: A year later it is unseasonally mild - and a lot greener in the North Yorkshire Moors

TODAY: Scattered showers expected this afternoon - and it will be cold across the north. Some snow expected in Scotland on high ground. There will be constant heavy rain from midnight tonight, spreading from the west of the country.

SATURDAY: It will be cold and windy in the north although in the south and central areas it should remain largely dry.

SUNDAY: Windy in the north on Sunday with early rain across England and Wales clearing eastwards to leave it dry with sunny spells and isolated showers.

There will be showers in north-west Scotland, these wintry over the hills. Early showers in Northern Ireland will die out to leave it mostly dry with sunny spells. Mild for November.

Now weathermen have put their necks on 
the line and told us there will be no repeat of last year's big freeze -
so it might just be the time to stock up on winter woollies, gloves and
scarves.

Just days before the beginning of December it is more sultry in Sussex than in Syria.

The
weather has been so unseasonably mild that Met Office forecasters say 
Britain is on course for its warmest ever November, and December won't 
be much different.

Much of the country has enjoyed unusually
warm weather in recent weeks, with the temperatures hitting 18c (64.4f)
in parts of the UK. 

Many people have yet to reach for the gloves, scarves and thermal vests, and it could be a while before they have to do so.

The Met Office says figures for the month so far reveal the average UK temperature has been 9.4c (48.9f) – the November average is 5.9c (42.6f).

The mean temperature in the South-East and East Anglia –  traditionally one of the UK’s warmest regions – has been a balmy 11.2c (52f), which is 4.5c above the usual average.

The average temperature for Middlesex is 11.8, 4.3 degrees warmer than normal.

The Met Office says the unusual weather is caused by warm air blown up from southern Europe. It is also drier than normal.

Average rainfall in the first two weeks of November was 25mm, less than half of what would usually have fallen.

Northern Scotland had just 10.9mm of 
rain during the first two weeks of the month - just one twentieth (six 
per cent) of the long term average.

Sarah Holland, of the Met Office, 
said: ‘The warmest November ever recorded in the UK was in 1994, when 
the average mean temperature was 8.8c (47.8).

'It’s too early to say whether it’s going to be above that, but it looks like it could be one of the warmest.’

She said the weather this weekend would be ‘unsettled’ for much of Britain but that temperatures would remain unusually high.

They could top 13c (55.4f) in Sussex – double the November average and warmer than Damascus in Syria, where the mercury is not expected to rise above 11c (51.8f) this weekend.

And while November has been warm. that is set to continue into December as a repeat of last year's extreme weather looks increasingly unlikely.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: 'There’s no signal for a repeat of last 
year's December cold spell.

'Last December saw a very prolonged period with wave after wave of cold spells 
and snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures.

'But rather than that, it looks like we're in for a mixed, unsettled December 
this year, with some cold spells but also milder spells.'
