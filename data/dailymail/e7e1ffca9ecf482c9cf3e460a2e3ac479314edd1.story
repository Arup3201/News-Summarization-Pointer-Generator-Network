A businesswoman whose company sold ‘edible’ cupcake glitter which was made from shredded plastic has been ordered to pay more than £13,000 in fines and court costs.

Margaret Martin's business EdAble Art Ltd, which she claims is named after three animated mice characters called Ed, Able and Art, marketed the dodgy sparkle as an edible decoration when in fact it was made from plastic normally used for drinks bottles.

Leeds Magistrates' Court in West Yorkshire heard that she sold the glitter, which is meant for use on greetings cards, to sugar craft suppliers and cake shops in such a way it made them believe it was suitable for consumption.

Margaret Martin's business EdAble Art Ltd, which she claims is named after three animated mice characters called Ed, Able and Art, marketed the dodgy glitter, pictured, as an edible decoration when in fact it was made from plastic normally used for drinks bottles

She misled a cake business into believing her products could be eaten and as a result the cake business produced glittered cupcakes coated with the tiny pieces of shredded plastic and sold them to the public, the court was told.

Trading Standards warned the plastic material used for the glitter was not edible and was manufactured as craft material. It has a chemical name of polyethylene terephthalate.

The effect on the human digestive system is unknown but the glitter should not be eaten.

On Monday, the court imposed a total of £13,515 in fines and court costs on both Martin personally and her business.

The court fined EdAble Art Ltd a total of £3,500, ordered an additional £8,000 was paid in court costs, as well as a £15 victim surcharge.

In addition, Martin was personally handed a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,000 in court costs.

The court heard EdAble Art Ltd ignored repeated advice from its local Trading Standards department in Durham and continued to misleadingly market the glitter as edible.

Councillor Bill Urry, of the West Yorkshire Trading Standards Committee, said: 'If the company had followed previous advice issued by both their Local Authority and the Food Standards Agency these proceedings would not have been brought.

‘No consumer would want to eat this product if they knew its true composition.’

Leeds Magistrates' Court, pictured,  ordered EdAble Art Ltd to pay a total of £11,515 in court costs and fines. Martin was also handed a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,000 in court costs

Charges were brought under the Food Safety Act 1990 for supplying food not of the nature demanded and the Food Additives (England) Regulations 2009 for supplying a non-approved Food Additive.

Martin was also prosecuted under the General Food Regulations 2004 for failure to supply information to the local authority and the Companies Act 2006 for failure to disclose company information.

She denied the offences - but was convicted after a three-day trial.
