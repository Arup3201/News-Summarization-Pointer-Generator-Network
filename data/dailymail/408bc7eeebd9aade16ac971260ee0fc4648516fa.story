A woman who shouted 'f*** the police' as she cycled past officers in the street has been awarded a $100,000 settlement from a federal court because it violated her free speech.

Amy Elizabeth Barnes was arrested after screaming abuse, including 'Cobb police suck', and sticking her middle finger up at deputies questioning a black man outside a store in Marietta, Georgia.

The political activist was then placed in solitary confinement when she was taken into custody on Easter Sunday in 2012.

Settlement: Amy Elizabeth Barnes was arrested after screaming abuse, including 'Cobb police suck', and sticking her middle finger up at deputies questioning a black man outside a store in Marietta, Georgia, in 2012

She then went to court saying her First Amendment rights were violated while claiming she was maliciously prosecuted when she was jailed on charges of disorderly conduct and the use of abuse words to 'incite an immediate breach of the peace.'

A judge ruled that even though her language was 'offensive', in constituted 'political speech'. 

Cynthia Counts, her lawyer, told The Atlanta Constitution-Journal: 'Ms. Barnes’ comments to the police may have been offensive, but no one in the United States of America should be chased down and arrested for their free speech.

'The officers argued that it was a bad neighborhood and you shouldn’t disrespect the police because it could create issues.' 

Judge Melodie Clayton said Miss Barnes had not confronted the officers when she shouted the abuse and instead rode away on her bicycle.

In her judgement, she described how it was then that the cops stopped questioning the suspect and pursued her instead.

Activist: She went to court saying her First Amendment rights were while violated claiming she was maliciously prosecuted. A judge said even though her language was offensive it constituted 'political speech'

She wrote: 'The evidence at trial showed that the Defendant was not engaged in a face-to-face confrontation with the officers which tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace when the words were spoken.

'In addition, the word “su*k”, used as an epithet, is now common enough in modern society that it cannot reasonably provoke a threat of violence. 

'The defendant’s other statement, “(expletive) the police,” was a fleeting epithet that was insulting and inappropriate, but it did not create an immediate threat and danger of violence.

'The defendant’s statements, although offensive to this court, clearly constitute political speech.'

In 2013, the county solicitor also lost the criminal case against Barnes.
