Andy Murray could announce Amelie Mauresmo as his long-term coach as early as next week.

The deposed Wimbledon champion met Mauresmo on Thursday, a day after his meek quarter-final defeat by Grigor Dimitrov, and wants to finalise arrangements before departing for a training camp in Miami at the end of next week.

But there are still pertinent issues to be ironed about between Mauresmo and the rest of Murray’s support team.

Fallout: Murray's quarter-final exit at Wimbledon has led to him having to re-assess his team

Assistant coach Dani Vallverdu was understood to be unhappy about the timing of Mauresmo’s appointment - though not the decision to hire the Frenchwoman - and even considered ending his four-year stint working with Murray.

Fitness trainer Jez Green has also been unsettled and wants a clear structure to be established if Mauresmo is to continue working with the Scot. Both men have sought reassurances about their positions. 

But Murray’s camp insist talks have progressed well, while the intention was always to trial working with Mauresmo during the grass-court season before making a more formal, long-term agreement if the pair were happy.

Apart from reassuring some other members of Team Murray there are still several stumbling blocks to overcome.

Pushing himself? Or maybe, the disastrous performance was all down to Murray himself?

Mauresmo has returned to France for a holiday and it is unclear whether she would be willing to commit to an four-week block of training with Murray in Miami before his next tournament in Toronto from August 6.

The 35-year-old must also honour her commitments as captain of the French Fed Cup team, which would take her away from Murray for around two months each year.
