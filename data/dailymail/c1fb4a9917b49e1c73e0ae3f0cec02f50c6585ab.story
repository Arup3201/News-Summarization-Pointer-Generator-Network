A firefighter who fought Australia's worst bushfires on Black Saturday is suing a fire agency for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Glenn Barlow, named by The Age,  said he was left traumatised after he and crew members were directed into the bushfire in Kinglake West, central Victoria without any warning of the severity of the fast-approaching fire.

The former firefighter is the first volunteer to bring a personal injury claim against the Country Fire Authority (CFA), which will see the Bushfires Royal Commission investigated for duty of care.

The Black Saturday firestorm saw Coombs Road engulfed in flames killing six people. The fire swept from Kilmore-to-Kinglake killing 119 people and destroying 1242 homes

On Saturday  February 7, 2009, Mr Barlow and other CFA fighters were ordered to Coombs Road, Kinglake West, a no-through road with a smoke sighting.

The Black Saturday firestorm saw Coombs Road engulfed in flames killing six people. The fire swept from Kilmore to Kinglake  killing 119 people and destroying 1242 homes.

Mr Barlow has outlined in an investigation report the 'traumatising' ordeal he and his fellow fighters faced whilst being trapped on Coombs Road.

He said the crew lost water supply while they were taking shelter from the fire. The report said Mr Barlow suffered a major shoulder injury and cites two firefighters who experienced smoke inhalation and burns to the head, face and eyes.

According to a royal commission on the 2009 bushfires, CFA divisions were aware of the potential spread of the fire by mid-afternoon but failed to formally alert crew members of the deadly risks when entering the road in Kinglake West. 

The crew lost communication in the fires after experiencing radio congestion and failure so was not given a 'red flag' warning by CFA officials.

The 57-year-old has been left 'totally incapacitated' from employment since Black Saturday, forcing him to file a claim in the Victorian Supreme Court that asserts the CFA was negligent and failed to provide duty of care. The statement insists the Kinglake West fire brigade was failed by the fire agent who should have properly assessed the bushfire.

He said he has been left with psychiatric damage which includes, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic adjustment disorder, anxiety and depression. 

Karen Barrow, another firefighter who was second lieutenant on the day, shared in Mr Barlow's frustration against the CPA and said prior to Black Saturday crew members made formal complaints about the supply of inadequate communication equipment.

'There was no information whatsoever. We only knew what we could ascertain from the CFA website and ABC Radio,' Ms Barrow told the 2009 royal commission. 

She said a CFA operations officer said the fire agent was 'not prepared to spend any further money on the existing communications infrastructure.' 

A CFA spokeswoman told The Age it could not provide comment since Mr Barlow's lawsuit is in process.

A date for Mr Barlow's case has not been set and his loss of earnings have not been estimated.
