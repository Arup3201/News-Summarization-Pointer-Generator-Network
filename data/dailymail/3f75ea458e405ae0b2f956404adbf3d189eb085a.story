Katie Couric has lambasted the Today show for its abrupt ousting of Ann Curry - a dismissal which she said made her feel 'terrible' for her former colleague.

Couric, who herself hosted Today from 1991 until 2006 and worked alongside Curry at CBS Evening News, said the handling of the firing in June was 'not the best chapter' for the show.

'I felt really bad for Ann. I still don't understand why they didn't give her sort of a proper send-off,' she told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

'Ann did some extraordinary work during 
her time there. It was just not the best chapter in the Today show. It
made me sad for the institution.'

Couric, who is just weeks away from launching her new talk show 'Katie', is apparently unable to drop the subject, coming to her friend and former colleagues' defense on numerous occasions.

'It really broke my heart this morning to see Ann, because I know 
she’s suffering and is feeling a lot of pain with this transition,' Couric said after Curry's last show aired in June.

'I
know that it’s really hard for everyone on the show. I 
still have a lot of great friends that I made over those 15 years on the
Today show, and this kind of tumult is really hard for everyone.'

After an emotional final show in 
which Curry apologised for 'not being able to take the ball all the way 
to the finish line', she was replaced with Savannah Guthrie. Ratings have
since dropped.

Since her 
departure, which came after just a year on the show, it has been alleged
that Curry was forced out as Matt Lauer refused to sign a contract 
unless he would not be hosting alongside her.

'I think it was not where her real passion was,' NBC News President Steve Capus explained a day after she left. 'In her heart of hearts, I think she would admit that.'

Couric's comments are just the latest attack on the networks that boosted her career over the past three decades.

In an interview in this month's Good Housekeeping magazine, she claimed that she felt ‘liberated’ after leaving CBS, where she hosted CBS Evening News for five years until 2011.

She said that anchoring the show
left her feeling 'constrained' and that only by biting her her tongue and 
just getting on with it could she deal with the poisonous atmosphere.

She was the first woman to anchor a network TV news show in America having taken over from Bob Schieffer.

'I’m really proud of the work I did,' she said, but 'it wasn’t the right environment for 
me. In terms of the atmosphere, it wasn’t a good fit for my 
sensibilities and my personality.

'I'm not a quitter. There were times when I thought to myself, Gee do I need this?

'But I thought, you know what? I can do this job as well as anyone. If people are projecting their own issues onto me, that's not my problem. I resolved to do the best job I could.'

Speaking
to the Philadelphia Inquirer, she said she is now looking forward to 
her new show, Katie, which premieres on September 5 on ABC. It is 
reportedly paying her $40m a year.

Getting ready: Couric has been flying around the country to promote the new talk show on ABC

The mother of two teenage girls said that since leaving CBS, she has been far more relaxed and that not having to put on makeup every day is a 'Godsend'.

She has a string on high-profile guests featuring in the first few episodes, including Jessica Simpson, flesh-eating bacteria victim Aimee Copeland and Amanda Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito.

Barbra Streisand, Sofia Vergara, Chelsea
Handler and Fifty Shades of Grey author E.L. James are also among the guests in 
her the first few weeks.

'I'm not gonna go all PBS on you,' she said, adding she would also host a show about troop suicides. 'I'm gonna also be doing topics that are pure fun. There are fun topics you can cover intelligently.'

Couric, 55, said Oprah Winfrey was an inspiration but added: 'When people say, "Are you the new Oprah?" I say, "No, I'm the old Katie".'
