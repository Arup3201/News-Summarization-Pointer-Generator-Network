Left for dead: Eva Casara, a 17-year-old expectant mother, was shot in the back of the head, robbed and dumped in the snow Christmas Day in Dolton, Illinois

South suburban Chicago authorities say someone shot and killed a 17-year-old pregnant girl on Christmas Day — but that her baby was saved.

Doctors pronounced Eva Casara, of Calumet City, dead at an area hospital Thursday morning. She had been shot in the back of the head Wednesday in Dolton.

Dolton Police Chief John Franklin expressed condolences to the teen's family. He added that it's ‘unimaginable to lose a child on such a holy day.’

Police say Casara was found fatally injured Wednesday evening lying in the snow between two houses in the south suburban community. She was around five-and-a-half months pregnant.

No suspects were in custody Friday, but Franklin says there are solid leads in the case.

According to Eva's grandmother, Fannie Casara, the teen stepped out of her home with a group of friends Wednesday afternoon saying she would be back shortly. But she never returned.

Worried family members made repeated attempts to reach her, but the girl's cell phone went straight to voice-mail.

Crime scene: Eva was found with a gunshot wound in this alleyway

Then at around 3.30am Thursday, the Casara family were told by police that the 17-year-old expectant mother had been found shot in the 1100 block of East 152nd Street.

Eva Casara was shot once in the back of the head and left for dead in the snow. Her assailants also took her iPhone, purse, coat and hat.

'They treated her like a dog and just shot her in the back of the head,' her grandmother told Chicago Sun-Times.

Full of life: Eva dropped out of high school in September but was planning to get her GED and then go to college to study nursing

Casara was rushed to Franciscan St Margaret Health Hospital and was then transferred to Advocate Christ Medical Center.

The mortally wounded teen went into cardiac arrest three times, but doctors kept her on life support long enough to save her baby girl. The young mother was pronounced dead at 11am Thursday without ever regaining consciousness.

Eva's premature baby, weighing just over a pound, is currently listed in critical condition. The family plan to name her Lailani Paris – a name Eva herself had picked after learning she was having a girl, Chicago Tribune reported. 

According to Casara's family, the teen dropped out of high school in September to take care of her baby, but she had big dreams.

Fannie Casara, Eva's grandmother and legal guardian, said that her granddaughter, a bright girl who loved reading, was planning to get her GED and then go to college to study nursing.

Police believe Eva was gunned down in the 1520 block of Dorchester Avenue, and her body was later moved to the site where she was eventually found after lying nearly an hour on the ground.

Grief: Estrellita Casara said her daughter was beautiful inside and out

During a press conference, her distraught mother made a tearful plea, asking the public to help find those responsible for her child’s brutal death.

‘My princess...I miss her so much,’ Estrelita Casara said. ‘Everywhere she goes, she just lights up the place. She's as beautiful inside as she is outside ... Please, somebody, anybody, help me with my baby.’
