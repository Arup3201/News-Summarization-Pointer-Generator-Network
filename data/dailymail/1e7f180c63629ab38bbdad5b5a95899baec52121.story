Iranian authorities have executed two men convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad and the American CIA spy agency, according to the country's state radio.

Mohammad Heidari, accused of passing 
security-related information and secrets to Mossad agents in 
exchange for money, and Kourosh Ahmadi, accused of gathering information
for the CIA, were hanged at dawn, it said.

The sentence for their execution was handed down by Tehran's Revolutionary Court and confirmed by the country's Supreme Court.

The report did not say when the pair were arrested nor when their trial took place.

Iran has in the past said it had successfully detected and dismantled spy networks operating inside the country.

Tehran accuses Israel and the U.S. of spying on its vital interests, particularly its nuclear program, which the West suspects is aimed at producing an atomic weapon.

Tehran denies the charge. It has blamed the assassinations of 
scientists associated with its disputed nuclear programme on Western spy
agencies, especially Mossad.

The men were hanged in the capital Tehran at dawn for allegedly passing secrets to Mossad and the CIA

The United States has denied any role in the killings. Israel has not commented.

Both Israel and the U.S have not ruled out a military option against Iran's nuclear facilities.

Last month, Amnesty International reported that Iran had 314 officially confirmed executions in 2012, the second highest behind China. It is feared that the actual total is much higher.
