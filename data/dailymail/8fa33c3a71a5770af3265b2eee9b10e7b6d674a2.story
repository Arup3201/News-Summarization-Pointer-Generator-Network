Major companies operating in Australia do not have measures in place to ensure their products are free from child labour or forced labour, a two-year investigation into the electronics industry has revealed.

Some of the high-profile companies investigated that need to make improvements include Woolworths and Dick Smith Electronics.

China-based Hisense and Australian-owned Palsonic fared the worst among the companies investigated, in a report from Baptist World Aid Australia.

In the Electronics Industry Trend Report, Finland-based Nokia was rated the best in most categories.

Despite coming under fire last year for their practices regarding child and forced labour in China, Apple sits fairly high on the rankings - being awarded a B+ overall

B+ - Nokia (only company to pay partial living wage), Apple, LG and Microsoft

B - Intel, HP, Motorola Mobility, Panasonic, Sanyo and Samsung

B- - Acer, Dell, Dell Alienware, Motorola Solutions, Olympus and Toshiba

C+ - Philips and Woolworths (AWA, Abode, Essentials and name-brand)

C - Garmin, Hitachi, Sharp, Sony and TomTom

C- - Blackberry, IBM and Sandisk

D+ - Fujitsu

D - Amazon (Kindle), Dick Smith Electronics, HTC, Nintendo and Oracle

D- - Asus, Canon, Huawei, Kogan, Lenovo, Soniq and TEAC

F - Hisense and Palsonic

Companies were ranked based on their efforts to combat child exploitation and slavery in their supply chains.

The report, released on Wednesday, provides a way for consumers to check up on the business practices of electronics companies, and chose who to buy from accordingly.

It also allows companies to compare their practices with their peers.

All of the 39 companies investigated have room for improvement, according to the reort, with 97 per cent of them unable to demonstrate they were paying their workers enough to cover basic needs.

Only Nokia could hold its head high.

Some companies, such as Apple, LG, and Microsoft, rated highly in the report - but none received a mark higher then B+.

Companies such as Hisense and Palsonic - which scored an 'F' grade in all the ranked categories - are urged to raise their game.

The industry as a whole was commended for knowing their suppliers at the final stage of production, with 49 per cent of the graded companies passing.

Should prominent business owners be taking more responsibility? Dick Smith, who founded Dick Smith Electronics before selling it to Woolworths, and Ruslan Kogan, founder of Kogan electronics, are being called on to ensure more ethical practices among their supply chains

Exploitation and slavery:  In this ranking list, the companies were given a letter-grade, based on how well they addressed exploitation and slavery issues

But, at the raw materials level of the supply chain, none of the companies had complete knowledge of where their materials were sourced and only 18 per cent had partial knowledge.

Baptist World Aid advocacy manager Gershon Nimbalker said: 'If companies don't know or don't care who is producing their products, it's much harder to know whether workers are being exploited or even enslaved.'

Nokia was the only company that could demonstrate its code of conduct was making a difference for workers manufacturing their products, with collective bargaining agreements in place.

Of the 39 companies, 34 per cent had codes of conduct that featured the right to collective bargaining.

Mr Nimbalker said: 'The ability for workers in developing countries to organise and negotiate collectively is absolutely essential for balancing the bargaining power of employers. We commend Nokia for recognising this and putting it into practice.'

Of the major Australian retailers that also sell their own ranges of electronic goods, Woolworths (which stocks its own Abode, AWA, Essentials, and name-brand goods) did the best - managing to score a C+ overall.

Dick Smith Electronics did only slightly worse, scoring a D.

Fellow Australian electronics company Kogan sat just below Dick Smith, scoring a D- overall.

Baptist World Australia hopes the report empowers consumers to take action.

Mr Nimbalker said: 'We know that when consumers call for change, they have the power to transform the practices of companies, and through them the communities they work with. Weâ€™re excited about the impact this report will have.

'Workers in developing countries work long hours in often oppressive conditions to make the phones, TVs and tablets that we enjoy. The additional cost to ensure that they are rewarded for their efforts with a wage that is sufficient for them and their families to live is only a few dollars per product.

'By some estimates, as little as two to nine dollars per smart phone or less than 1.5 per cent of the total price.'

Woolworths, Dick Smith Electronics, Kogan, Nokia, Apple, and Palsonic were unable to provide any comment.
