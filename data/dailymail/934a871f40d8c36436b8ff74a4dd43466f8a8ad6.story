When soprano Laura Wright steps on to the pitch in front of 81,000 rugby fans at Twickenham this afternoon, she hopes to dazzle in a stylish outfit that won’t suffer the sort of revealing wardrobe malfunction that made headlines at the Six Nations a fortnight ago.

Yet away from the limelight, the 22-year-old shuns glamour for the rough and tumble of rugby first-hand – playing full-back for her local club in South-West London where spectators number in the dozens, not the tens of thousands.

Now, in this exclusive Mail on Sunday photoshoot, the ‘Scrummy Soprano’ shows off both sides of her image, posing in both a mud-splattered England kit and a Maria Grachvogel designer gown.

‘It’s nice to feel girly and glamorous sometimes,’ Laura says.

But she admits that  her last appearance as England’s official anthem singer – when a gust of wind lifted up her white split-to-the-armpit Jasper Conran dress and exposed her hotpants – wasn’t quite the image she was hoping to project.

‘You’re representing your country,’ she says. ‘You don’t want to overstep the mark.’

She promises to be more demure when she sings at today’s England-Italy clash.

‘I can’t wear any less,’ she admits. ‘Could you call it a dress? It was a bit of material, wasn’t it? There were wind issues last time, but I didn’t really think about it. I just wanted to go out and look good and sing well.’

There is little doubt that Laura takes everything she does seriously. As well as studying at the Royal  College of Music and working on her third solo album, she is training for the London Marathon and an international CrossFit challenge, an intense discipline combining weightlifting, sprinting and gymnastics.

Sport, not singing, was her first love, and she relishes her time playing for the Rosslyn Park Ladies, nicknamed the ‘Slingbacks’, even if it means that she is forever having to cover the cuts on her legs for her professional singing engagements.

‘I can’t tell you how your body feels after a rugby match,’ she says. ‘It’s like nothing else, like no other sport I’ve ever done.’

Her first match after her last Twickenham appearance was against Beckenham. ‘They were quite aggressive at the beginning,’ she recalls. ‘We didn’t win but we only lost 20-nil. It was a vast improvement, as the first time we lost 55-nil.’

Suffolk-born Laura has been hailed as the next Katherine Jenkins, although it is a comparison Laura dislikes. She says: ‘Katherine has done so well, but I want to make my own name.

It’s so funny how different we are. When I’m not working, I’m always in jeans and trainers. I respect what she does, but I want to do things differently.’

Laura shot to prominence when she won BBC Radio 2’s Chorister  Of The Year competition at 15. She  then became the youngest member of the classical girl band All Angels, leaving after she won her college place. Nevertheless, combining demands there with her own career is difficult.

Laura explains: ‘It’s been a struggle. There are five singers in my year. About 600 apply. So the college is going to expect a lot of you, that’s understandable. But I’d be silly not to take all the opportunities given to me. As a performer, you want to perform to as many people as possible.’

And she certainly won’t be short of an audience at Twickenham today.
