It will become a familiar sight as the season wears on. Every time Manchester United are awarded a free-kick in the general vicinity of the penalty box, a debate will ensue.

Angel di Maria will fancy his chances and Robin van Persie will think it's well within his range. Juan Mata will remind everyone that he has a good track record and Wayne Rooney will try to pull rank as captain. Radamel Falcao may well join the conversation too and others will throw in their thoughts.

If competition for places in United's starting line-up is intense for the Louis van Gaal-acticos, then the struggle to become regular free-kick taker is going to be really interesting.

Louis van Gaal has plenty of players capable of striking a set-piece at Manchester United

Angel di Maria got his Manchester United career off to a flying start by scoring direct from a free-kick in the 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers last Sunday - though he may not have meant it

Juan Mata is also a fine striker of a set-piece and is a candidate to take them regularly for United

Each of those five players is capable of taking a good free-kick but, of course, only one can win the argument each time.

New £60m signing Angel di Maria staked an early claim when he swung in United's opening goal from a wide free-kick against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

He succeeded in delivering the ball into the 'corridor of uncertainty', deceived goalkeeper Rob Green when everyone else missed it and found the far corner of the net. Whether he meant it barely matters.

Trouble is, Di Maria's qualities with the dead ball are unproven. He may well be an expert but with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the Real Madrid side he didn't get much of a look in.

As captain, Wayne Rooney may be able to pull rank when it comes to taking free-kicks

Robin van Persie is also capable of scoring direct from a free-kick

New loan signing Radamel Falcao can also strike the dead ball well 

Goals and assists from free-kicks since the start of the 2011-2012 season: 

Wayne Rooney – 5 goals (1 assist)

Juan Mata – 4 (3)

Robin van Persie – 2 (3)

Angel di Maria – 1 (2)

Radamel Falcao – 1 (0)

And while he can evidently deliver a killer ball from the wide positions, there are better candidates when the ball is close to the box in a central position.

Juan Mata is chief among them - he has scored four goals directly from free-kicks for Chelsea and United since 2011.

Two of them came at the tail end of last season, either side of David Moyes's sacking, against Newcastle United and Southampton.

In that same period of time, Mata has also contributed three assists from free-kicks, adding to his worth with from set-piece situations.

But many have predicted Mata will be the unfortunate one to lose his place as Van Gaal somehow tries to cram all his expensive players into his line-up, so step forward Wayne Rooney.

The United captain has curled home five free-kicks over the last three-and-a-bit seasons and is among the best from the 18-30 yard range.

Mata was on target from open play in the four-goal demolition of QPR 

Last season he found the target against Crystal Palace, Manchester City and West Brom with direct free-kicks, rare moments of joy as Moyes struggled to gather points early in the campaign.

And now that he has the armband, Rooney will have that little bit extra clout in those all-important negotiations at free-kicks.

But he's by no means the only capable front man. Robin van Persie is also an accomplished striker of a free-kick - just ask City, who were on the receiving end of his accurate boot in the last minute of the December 2012 meeting at the Etihad.

The Dutchman can't quite match Rooney's record - he has scored with just two since 2011 - but is willing and able if needed.

Last but not least is Radamel Falcao. He'll be more use in the box to get his head on the cross or pick up the scraps but the hotshot loanee striker can score direct from set pieces too, as shown by this one for Atletico Madrid against Real Sociedad in October 2012.

The stats suggest Mata is the best choice but of course each situation will be different. This is one argument Van Gaal might leave to the players to sort out amongst themselves.
