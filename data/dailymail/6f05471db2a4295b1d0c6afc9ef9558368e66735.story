One of Britain’s most famous athletes was  drawn into an investigation on Saturday night after it was claimed that the sport’s governing body failed to act upon ‘suspicious’ drugs test samples.

Dick Pound, a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), told the Mail on Sunday he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up.

In a scandal now engulfing the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), 225 athletes from 39 countries were revealed to have produced anomalous blood readings. They include three British athletes – one of whom is a household name and a star of track and field events. 

Dick Pound, a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up

The star’s name appears on a leaked list of 65 athletes whose tests scores were labelled ‘Suspicion Red’ – which experts say should have triggered an automatic check for the banned drug EPO. The drug helps deliver oxygen to muscles by stimulating the production of red blood cells.

But amid mounting concerns that the IAAF did not conduct follow-up tests on most or all of the sportsmen and women, Mr Pound – one of the sport’s most senior figures – has been approached to establish what happened to the results. 

He said: ‘What I understood… was that a great number of cases came back and were short of something that could be declared positive, but whoever had done the analysis clearly thought that there was something afoot.’

The British star has so far declined to comment, yet the scandal has already claimed several high-ranking executives and shows little sign of abating.

The ‘Suspicion Red’ list is among a cache of documents sourced by The Mail on Sunday and said to have come from a whistleblower at the IAAF’s Medical Commission. Although undated, the list is said to have been compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the introduction into athletics of much stricter tests for banned substances.

It has been argued that it is unlikely any readings taken during this period could be used to investigate athletes retrospectively, but Mr Pound said it may be possible to uncover past violations of cheating if these readings are used in conjunction with frozen samples.

While being named on the list does not provide conclusive evidence that the British star was taking banned substances, experts have said it raises serious questions about whether proper checks were made.

Elsewhere in the documents are more detailed lists which do not mention the British athlete, but do suggest that World and Olympic champions showed abnormal blood values that strongly suggest the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

These more detailed documents relate to tests taken between 2001 and 2006. The two other Britons named are less high-profile, and the level of suspicion is lower and coded ‘orange.’

The IAAF does not dispute the authenticity of the information, which was first obtained by the German television station ARD-WDR and broadcast in a documentary last month, without revealing any names, but it says it may not prove the stars had been cheating and suggested other factors might have produced high test results.

However, on Saturday night the former head of Jamaica’s anti-doping commission described the IAAF’s response to the scandal as ‘completely unsatisfactory’ and suggested there was more to the list ‘than we are being told’.

Renee Anne Shirley, a respected campaigner for transparency in sport, added that the existence of the ‘red’ list ‘raises serious concerns about what happened next’.

She said: ‘That is the real issue here. Being on such a list in the first place is in itself indicative that something irregular has been flagged up.

‘Did the IAAF target test the people on this list, as I would expect should have been the case, or not? And if not, why not?

‘I think there is more to this list than we have been told and the IAAF’s response so far is completely unsatisfactory. What did they find when they did further investigation? Did they in fact do anything?

‘With everything going on and so much uncertainty, it is simply unsatisfactory to say there is no problem and expect people to accept that blindly.’

Many of the names listed in the documents are accompanied by detailed readings of their blood values, with figures appearing under various headings. For instance, one is ‘hgb’ – haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood.

The documents also record the altitude level – which can affect red blood cell count – at which the tests took place. Together, the results produce an overall figure known as the ‘off score’ level and anything over 125 is considered to be a marker of potential doping.

The documents show that the highest ‘off score’ level for a male athlete was 167.63 – considered to be extraordinarily high – yet there is no record that he was charged with a doping offence.

The highest ‘off score’ level for a female athlete is 170.03 and again there is no public record of the athlete being charged.

More than a quarter of the athletes named in documents are Russian, lending credence to claims that Moscow operated an ‘East German-style’ doping regime. There is also a high number of Kenyans on the lists. 

The IAAF has claimed that it did follow up ‘suspicious’ readings of blood levels and exonerated many of the names. It emphasised the appearance of a name on a list marking suspicion did not indicate that a doping offence had taken place.

IAAF general secretary Nick Davies has insisted that the mere presence of a suspicious value does not indicate a positive test, and that the information provided by the documents ‘was partial and misleading.’ 

Mr Pound said WADA's inquiry has 'resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious'

He has also said in a statement that: ‘Athletes with a “red flag” reading may well be guilty of doping but equally – and we can prove it in the vast majority of cases – they may be innocent, which is why this information should have stayed locked up in a safe.’

On Saturday night, he told The Mail on Sunday in an email: ‘We welcome the intervention of WADA. In all our statements we have underlined that we will co-operate totally with WADA.’

Asked whether he believed the IAAF had followed up suspicious blood readings, he replied: ‘Yes – but let WADA do their work now.’

Mr Pound will establish the terms of reference for the WADA inquiry before deciding whether to accept the invitation to lead it.

He said: ‘WADA has a general monitoring responsibility with respect to international standards and with respect to the anti-doping code.

‘We are meant to do that and it’s part of our mandate. And this is a specific inquiry that has resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious.

‘I think our stakeholders, the IOC, the international federations and the public authorities, would expect us to do something and our chairman has responded by saying yes indeed we agree and will set up a commission and give it the neces- sary resources to do whatever has to be done.’

There is already a separate IAAF ethics commission inquiry into the doping lists.

Last week three key IAAF figures – treasurer Valetin Balaknichev, marketing consultant Massata Papa Diack, and legal adviser Habib Cisse – agreed to stand down while allegations against them were investigated by the ethics committee.
