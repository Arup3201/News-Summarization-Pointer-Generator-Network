Ultra-Orthodox Jews took to the beach in Israel, making the most of a ceasefire called in the conflict over Gaza.

The Israeli citizens, still adhering to their strict and conservative standards of dress, were seen on the beaches yesterday as Israeli and Palestinian authorities agreed a five-day extension to the current ceasefire. 

Hundreds of Israelis were seen on the sand and in the sea at Ashdod, less than 30 miles from the war-torn Gaza strip. Men, who made up the overwhelming majority of the crowd, were seen 

During the ceasefire, Israeli forces have stopped their ground operations in Gaza, while Hamas has agreed to stop firing rockets into Israel.

However, overnight the Israeli Defense Forces reported that eight missiles were launched from Gaza regardless, one of which hit a local government building near the border.
