Jesse Matthew, the man charged with the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, dropped out of a second university a decade ago after another rape allegation, it has emerged.

After leaving Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in October 2002, Matthew attended Christopher Newport University - but quit following another accusation in September 2003, records have shown.

Now more than a decade after the allegations - for which he never faced any charges - he has been linked to the disappearance of Graham, 18, who vanished from Charlottesville on September 13.

Investigators are now looking into his movements over the last 12 years, focusing on the  six months he attended CNU when two other young women disappeared without a trace.

He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. 

The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped.

His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported. 

On Wednesday, CNU also released a 'criminal incident information' report, which said an alleged incident involving Matthew took place on September 7, 2003, CNN reported.

Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school.

Break? Police say there is a DNA link between the murder of Morgan Harrington, 20 (left), in 2009 and Graham's disappearance. Cassandra Morton, 23, (right) also went missing around the same time as Harrington

It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved or whether Matthew quit due to an investigation.

'The University is fully cooperating with law enforcement agencies,' a statement from CNU said. 'The success of the criminal investigation is paramount at this time.'

Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the Graham's disappearance. The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with her.

He is now being held in isolation in a Virginia jail cell.

After new forensic evidence also allegedly connects him to the high-profile abduction, rape and murder of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington in 2009, police are now looking at whether he was involved in any other disappearances over the past decade.

Second: Eleven months later, he dropped out of his new school, Christopher Newport University, pictured, following another allegation of rape. He was not charged in either incident

While he studied at CNU, from January to October 2003, two local women went missing and were never found again.

Autumn Wind Day, 24, was last seen shopping at the Food Lion grocery store two miles from campus when she disappeared on July 24, 2003.

Less than two months later, 31-year-old Sophie May Rivera went missing after leaving her home located seven miles from CNU. Matthew  dropped out of school a month later. 

Local police are now reopening the two cold cases to see if Matthew may have been involved.

'While there are no indications that Jesse Matthew is connected to these two cases, both will be reviewed,' Newport News police spokesman Lou Thurston told WAVY. 

It's uncertain what Matthew did for the next several years but police say they have linked him to Harrington's disappearance and murder in October 2009.

Filling in the blanks: Matthew worked as a taxi driver and a source told MailOnline that he gave girls free rides. It's uncertain what he did between leaving CNU in 2003 and picking up his career as a cabbie in 2010

Her body was found three months later, hidden at a remote farm. DNA evidence of her killer, found on her remains, has since been linked to a 2005 rape case of a Fairfax woman who survived the attack.

Eight years after dropping out of CNU, Matthew reappears in 2010 working as a taxi driver in Charlottesville. Two years later he got a position as a nurse's assistant at UVA Medical Cenewhere he was just recently fired following Graham's disappearance.

In that time, he may have played a role in the death of Morgan, and also another local woman who went missing around the same time - 23-year-old Lynchburg resident Cassandra Morton. 

Morton's decomposing body was found in November 2009 and the homicide remains unsolved. 

Authorities in Montgomery County Virginia are also reopening the double homicide of couple Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were found shot dead in a campground near the Virginia Tech campus in August 2009.

'Our investigators will certainly follow up and look at the facts surrounding the Hannah Graham case to see if there is a connection. However, at this time we have nothing to lead us to believe that there is a connection,' Capt. Brian Wright told ABC News. 

And three additional women went missing from Charlottesville around the same time Matthew moved there. 

Samantha Ann Clarke, 19, disappeared from Orange county in September 2010 and 19-year-old DaShad Laquinn Smith disappeared near there in November 2012, WUSA-TV reported.

Alexis Murphy, 17, disappeared after leaving her home in Shipman, Virginia, in August 2013. This May, Randolph Taylor, 48, was convicted of her abduction and murder in January although her body has never been found.

Another two young women, Alicia Showalter Reynolds, 25, and Anne Carolyn McDaniel, 20, were abducted and murdered in 1996 along the same Virginia corridor.
