Roberto Martinez says Everton will fully embrace the Europa League and make every effort to win another European trophy 30 years on from their last.

The Toffees are in Switzerland to play Young Boys of Bern in the last 32, first leg and their manager is seeing it as an opportunity to rescue a sub-par season.

The incentive of a place in next season’s Champions League is obvious but Martinez will be equally thrilled if his players can win Everton’s first European trophy since the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1985.

‘We have been involved in big things in European football a long time ago and that is something that needs to run in our DNA and we want to have this on a consistent basis,’ he said.

‘In terms of the season, we have never, never had a real momentum in the league and that has been affecting us in our results.

‘We have been pristine in Europe and facing teams like Wolfsburg, Lille and Krasnodar, they become really important fixtures for us and, now, in the knockout stages we are really excited and looking forward to it.

‘For us to be involved in the Europa League is a phenomenal opportunity to grow as a team, especially the young players, and it is something we need at the club.

‘We are desperate to see our fans here and making it a real good memory in European football.

‘We embrace the competitions and look forward to it and take this competitive edge into the Premier League and finish the season as strong as we can.’

Everton’s inconsistent league form may see them a disappointing 4th in the Premier League but they have excelled in Europe.

In the group stage, Wolfsburg, who lie second in the German Bundesliga, were beaten 4-1 at Goodison Park and 2-0 on their own group, while the Toffees also took four points off French side Lille.

But Young Boys, who are second to Basle in the Swiss top flight and play on an artificial surface at the Stade de Suisse, will represent a fresh challenge.

They have won their last seven European home games here, including group stage wins over Napoli (2-0), Slovan Bratislava (5-0) and Sparta Prague (2-0).

‘I have been very impressed and very surprised with Young Boys’ form,’ said Martinez.

‘They are a team that has been developing really strong form and have won eight and a draw in the last nine. That is impressive, impressive form.

‘The way they play at home with the Astroturf, they use that really, really well. Their positional play in possession is really impressive and they have good creativity with a very much attack-minded focus and that is why we are going to see such a good game.’

The return of European football after its winter pause sees the resumption of Thursday-Sunday football for Everton, but Martinez is confident they have the squad to cope.

‘You are talking about a period of three weeks where we have got five games. It is important we share the demands in the squad.

‘That's why I am so happy to get players back from injury and coming back into the side. It has given us a real strength in depth.

‘They are the sort of periods where, as a football club, we need to show we are ready to performance in Europe and ready to show it does not affect our domestic form and make sure we look forward to playing on Thursday and then on Sunday and consistently without dropping the level of performance.’
