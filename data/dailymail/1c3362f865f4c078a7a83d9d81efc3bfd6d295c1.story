Germantown police department had invited children to decorate their tree in the lead-up to Christmas in exchange for a stuffed animal that were placed beneath it. 

At some point in the festivities, the diamond ring appeared on the tree.

Police Chief Peter Hoell said: 'We had the ring examined and the diamonds are real. For now, we have placed it in safe keeping. 

'Anyone wishing to claim the ring will need to know a detailed description, or better yet, a picture of the owner wearing it.

'The ring was "intentionally" placed on the tree, it was not an accident. No crime was committed.' 

He added: 'I cannot dedicate someone to view five weeks of lobby video watching people decorate our tree in hopes to see the person who placed the ring on the tree. 

'All we are doing is giving the person who placed the ring on our tree an opportunity to claim the ring if they want it back.' 

Germantown is about 15 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin.
