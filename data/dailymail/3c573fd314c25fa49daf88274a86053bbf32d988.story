You might have thought the Victorian fashion for taxidermy was  dead and buried. 

But the craze for the gruesome hobby of stuffing and posing dead animals, has been growing in recent years and now  fans of the macabre art can learn to do it for themselves.

Mickey Alice Kwapis began teaching her unique taxidermy classes to the public three years ago.

Mickey said she found her work, turning something dead into 'something beautiful' very rewarding

Since then, thousands of people around the world have become have-a-go animal stuffers.

The artist, from Chicago in Illinois, teaches the course across five different countries - US, Canada, UK, New Zealand, and Australia.

Mickey, 24, said she became interested in taxidermy from a young age after collecting dead bugs.

Costs of the class range from $200 to $300 based on the cost of living in a given country. She insists on only using road kill, animals who have died from natural causes or animals that have been bred for human consumption for her work.

While it's not for the squeamish, Mickey said her students were often surprised the process was not as gruesome as they feared.

She said: 'Everyone I have in the classes is very open-minded.

'They wouldn't have signed up for a taxidermy class if they hated the idea of working with a deceased specimen.

'I think the most common reaction I get is that the process isn't as gross as students initially anticipate.

'It's eye-opening to be able to take something that's essentially a furry lump of frozen meat and turn it into something beautiful that looks alive and can last forever - that's so rewarding.'
