Guilty: Gurminder Singh, 29, (pictured) has been jailed for life after he murdered his lover Amandeep Kaur Hothi after he discovered she was married

A jilted boyfriend was jailed for life today for murdering his lover by slashing her throat in a hotel room after he discovered she was already married. 

Gurminder Singh, 29, attacked Amandeep Kaur Hothi after luring her to a hotel in Wolverhampton, West Midlands on March 5 last year.

A terrified Mrs Hothi had called her husband telling him 'I'm dying', but neither he nor police were able to find her in time.   

Singh stayed with her  body for 24 hours before eventually dialling 9999 and telling the operator he had self-harmed.

When paramedics arrived at the Britannia Hotel, they found Singh lying on the bed with a cut to his throat having tried to kill himself.

The body of the mother-of-two, who had also had her throat cut, was found on the floor.

Singh had denied murder but was found guilty by a jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Today he was jailed for life and told he would serve a minimum of 24 years.

During the trial, the court heard Mrs Hothi, from Wolverhampton, embarked on an affair with Singh, from Forest Gate, London, a year before her death.

She told him her name was Simran Sandhu and used a second mobile phone to communicate with him so her husband, Pal Singh, would not find out about the affair.

Robert Price, prosecuting, told the court Singh flipped when she tried to break off their relationship in order to 'guarantee that if he could not have her, then nobody else could.' 

A distraught Mr Singh told the jury how he heard his wife screaming for help as she was murdered.

'She told me she had got mixed up with a guy,' the factory worker had told the jury.

'I was at work and the machines were on. She could have said "I’m dying".

'She screamed as she spoke, I thought she was under attack and was very anxious but I did not know where she was.'

Speaking after the case, he said: 'Our family has been left devastated and traumatised by the events of the 5 and 6 March this year.

'We are heartbroken by the loss of Amandeep.

'We are pleased the person responsible has been found guilty. The court trial has been difficult and distressing emotionally for us to endure.

'The family is rallying together to look after Amandeep’s two young sons and we now want to be left alone to grieve and to come to terms with all that has happened.' 

Martin Lindop from the Crown Prosecution service described the case as 'tragic'. 

He said: 'This is a very tragic case where a young woman has entered into a relationship which has ultimately ended up costing her life and two young children losing their mother.

'Gurminder Singh was unable to accept the fact that the victim wanted to break off their relationship, but he persuaded the victim to meet him.

'Armed with a knife, he travelled up to Wolverhampton to meet Mrs Hothi.

'The defendant took the victim back to his hotel room, where he attacked her with the knife.

'Mrs Hothi tried to call her husband for help, but he and the police were unable to locate her.

'Singh then tried to commit suicide, but failing this, he called the emergency services for help, medical help which he denied Mrs Hothi.

'Our thoughts are today with the family and friends of Mrs Hothi.'
