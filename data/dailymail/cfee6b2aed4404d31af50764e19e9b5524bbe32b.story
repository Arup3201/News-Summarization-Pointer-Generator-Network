A charity formed after the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has been unable to account for more than $70,000 it raised through marathon running, one of its co-founders said Friday.

Ryan Graney, of Nashville, Tenn., said only $30,000 of the $103,000 taken in by the 26.4.26 Foundation was used for the organization's purpose.

That money was presented last January by co-founder Robbie Bruce to the nonprofit NYA, a youth sports center in Newtown, where the December 2012 shooting occurred.

Graney said Bruce was in charge of the organization's finances but has since cut off contact with her.

Bruce didn't return repeated telephone
 messages from The Associated Press, including one left with his sister.
 Public records list Bruce's address as an apartment in a gated complex 
on the southern outskirts of Nashville. No one answered the door there 
Friday afternoon.

An online 
biography lists Bruce, an endurance athlete, as co-founder of 
Nashville-based X3 Endurance, a fitness training company, which had a 
link to the foundation on its website. But Eddie Ferrell, another 
co-founder of that company, said it ended its relationship with Bruce 
almost a year ago and his whereabouts are unknown.

The
 idea behind the 26.4.26 Foundation was for runners to participate in 
marathons, raising money for each of the 26 miles they ran and 
dedicating each mile to one of the 26 victims of the school shooting â€” 
20 children and six educators. The fundraising effort was featured in 
Runner's World magazine and was the subject of several local news 
stories.

The group held its 
first marathon in Nashville a week after the shooting, with more than 
1,000 participants. Another was held in New Hampshire last April. More 
than 1,400 runners raised about $22,000 for the foundation, organizers 
said. The charity also received donations from runners in other events, 
Graney said.

Graney said she
 noticed something was amiss last spring, when she discovered suspicious
 charges to the foundation's PayPal account.

'I
 saw there was $1,200 billed for paddle boards,' she said. 'I went on 
(Bruce's) Instagram page, and he had posted a picture of a paddle board 
in the back of his truck.'

Graney
 said she confronted Bruce and he promised to meet her and go over the 
organization's finances. She said he never showed up and then cut off 
contact with her in September.

She
 said she filed complaints with the FBI and the Tennessee attorney 
general's office, which said they don't comment on ongoing 
investigations.

Graney said 
the foundation, registered as a nonprofit corporation in Tennessee, had 
virtually no overhead or other expenses that would justify not giving 
the vast majority of the proceeds to the people of Newtown.

'I am in tears, sick about this,' Graney said by telephone Friday.

The
 attorney general's office in Connecticut, which has been keeping track 
of charities that sprang up after the shooting, said it had no knowledge
 of the foundation.

The 
NYA's executive director, Dorrie Carolan, said her organization 
'graciously accepted a check in the amount of $30,000, which cleared 
shortly after it was received.'

Leigh
 Melia, who lives in Lebanon, 70 miles east of Newtown, ran 3 miles of 
the New Hampshire race as part of a relay team with a group of teachers 
and her then-7-year-old daughter. She said each mile was dedicated to a 
different Sandy Hook victim and she explained to her daughter who they 
were as they ran.

'When I 
ran, I thought the money was going to those victims and their families,'
 she said, adding she feels someone should be held accountable now that 
the money has gone missing.

Graney said her hope is publicizing the problem will help get the money to where it belongs.

'If
 I knew what was going on, I would have stopped it sooner,' she said. 'I
 feel terrible. I couldn't sit by and let this happen.'
