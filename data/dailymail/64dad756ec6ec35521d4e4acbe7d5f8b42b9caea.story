Manchester City face fresh questions from UEFA in the wake of the Frank Lampard debacle over how their extensive network of global companies are sharing the burden of the club’s massive financial losses.

City were fined £16million by Europe’s governing body last year for breaking Financial Fair Play regulations, had their transfer spending and wage bill limited and had to reduce their Champions League squad.

Since then, they have announced they are on course to meet UEFA’s new rules, having halved losses to £23m, £16m of which would be discounted as part of the UEFA fine.

However, UEFA is examining whether the creation of a set of subsidiary companies by City’s ‘parent’ company, City Football Group (CFG), allowed them to under-report losses for 2013-14.

The lack of transparency over Lampard  and his move, in which it was unclear whether he signed for New York City or Manchester City, has thrown a spotlight on the opaque nature of City’s accounts, which some believe are designed to confuse.

Two subsidiary companies, City Football Marketing Ltd and City Football Services Ltd, had operating expenses — or costs, including wages — of £36.7m in the year to May 2014, and posted combined losses of £25.9m. Most of their business was done effectively on behalf of Manchester City. 

A City spokesperson said: 'The examination of the Club's structure and subsidiary companies is a scheduled and routine part of the UEFA monitoring process.'
