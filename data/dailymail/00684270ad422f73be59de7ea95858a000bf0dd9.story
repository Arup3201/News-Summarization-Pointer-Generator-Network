A 36-year-old man arrested in connection with sex abuse allegations made by MP's wife Karen Danczuk has been released on bail. 

Mrs Danczuk, 31, who is the wife of anti-child sex abuse MP Simon Danczuk, claims she was raped and sexually assaulted 'hundreds of times' as a child at her family home in Manchester. 

The man, who lives a few miles from Mrs Danczuk, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police today and he has now been bailed until April 30.

After news of the arrest, Mrs Danczuk tweeted: 'For all those who doubted me, publicly slated me & made me feel like scum for coming out. I will NEVER forgive & NEVER forget!'

Mrs Danczuk, who has became well known for Twitter selfies showing off her ample cleavage, claims the abuse took place between 1989 and 1995 when she was aged between six and 12.

She said she was regularly abused in the bedroom of her family home in Middleton, Greater Manchester, shortly after her parents' marriage broke up.

Her father Martin Burke, now 73, moved out, leaving Mrs Danczuk, three older brothers and an older sister with their mother Susan Burke.

Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother, as well as two of her four siblings who challenged her story.

In response to the arrest today, Mrs Danczuk said she would never forgive those who doubted her claims

The family feud erupted this week as Mrs Danczuk publicly claimed her cleavage-baring selfies were rooted in the abuse she suffered as a child.

She told the Mail on Sunday her 'selfies' are a defiant way of saying: 'I'm sexy – and I'm in control now.'

But Mrs Burke, 58, called her daughter an 'attention-seeker' which led Mrs Danczuk to report her claims to the police 'as a matter of urgency, to prove I am telling the truth'.

Today, she told the Mail on Sunday that she felt 'more numb than angry' and her rage is instead directed at her mother.

She told the newspaper: 'I am not a fantasist. I am telling the truth. I was raped or sexually abused hundreds of times.

'She did nothing to protect me and I will never forgive her.'

Asked why she had waited two decades to name her attacker, she said: 'Because I am still coming to terms with it. It is a very difficult thing to confront – as any paedophile victim will know.'

DI Caroline Ward of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We work hard to support victims of sexual offences and thoroughly investigate all reports of sexual abuse and rape no matter how long ago they happened.

'We will do everything we can to support victims and bring offenders to justice.'
