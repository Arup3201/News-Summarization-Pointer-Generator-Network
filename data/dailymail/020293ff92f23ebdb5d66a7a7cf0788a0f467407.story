A six-year-old autistic boy was tied up by his teacher for more than five minutes in front of his class and had to 'beg' to be released, it was claimed today.

The woman is being investigated after allegedly using a security pass to bind Scott Lee’s hands behind his back as a punishment.

The school, The Meads Infants in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, has launched an investigation into the incident, which allegedly happened last week.

Punishment: Scott Lee, 6, allegedly had his hands tied behind his back in front of other children

Police, the local authority and social services are also involved.

The child’s irate father, Michael Lee, has demanded the teacher be sacked and prosecuted for the ‘barbaric’ incident and has taken his boy out of the school.

He said his son was only released after begging his teacher to untie him.

Scott has been accused of retaliating when another boy hit him, which then led to the apparent incident.

‘The past few days have been horrible - as a parent, it’s just awful imagining your own child being tied up,’ Mr Lee said.

‘Scott is a lovely little chap. He’s not disruptive, he’s never aggressive at all. He didn’t deserve this - no kid does.’

Mr Lee claims the school has allowed the teacher to continue in her role pending the outcome of the investigations into her conduct.

‘When I found out what happened I asked her (the teacher) if it was true and she said it was. She was smiling as she admitted what she’d done. She said “I did warn him”. As if that makes what she did ok.’

The Year 2 pupil says he has since suffered nightmares and fears that it will happen to him again if he misbehaves.

Mr Lee said a girl in the class told the teacher that Scott had hit a boy back and hit her too, an allegation Scott denies to his father and mother, Samantha, 31.

The teacher then allegedly warned Scott that she would tie his hands up if he hit the girl again.

A girl then told the teacher that Scott had hit out again.

Mr Lee says his son told him he had to pull his hands behind his back and the security pass was used to tie his wrists in 'figures of eights' behind his back.

Moments later, he was apparently ordered to sit on the floor, cross legged.

Mr Lee said: ‘The cord was so tight Scott couldn’t free his hands or work them loose.

‘She made him sit in that position in front of the other children in his class for five minutes before she released him.’

The father-of-two heard about the alleged incident the following morning at his son’s swimming class when a classmate told him.

The school has launched an internal investigation, which could result in the teacher’s dismissal.

Scott, who is the youngest in his year, was initially moved to another class but is now kept away from school.

In its prospectus, written in March 2010, the school’s head teacher writes about its policy on discipline.

‘Children are expected to conform to certain standards of behaviour. They are encouraged to show regard for other people, so any punishment or misdemeanour will at all times be moderate,' it says.

Last night a spokesman for Dyfed-Powys Police said: 'We are investigating an incident which was alleged to have occurred at a school in Milford Haven on 5 March 2012. Enquiries are continuing.'

Last night, Pembrokeshire County Council said - on behalf of social services and the education authority - it could not comment because ‘investigations are ongoing.’

The spokesman confirmed the authority was investigating the incident in addition to the police enquiries.
