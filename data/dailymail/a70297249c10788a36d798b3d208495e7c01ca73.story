A veteran Newtown Police Officer is facing dismissal and no compensation for not returning to work following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary last year.

Thomas Bean was among the first to respond to the horror at the Connecticut school which left 20 first graders and six adults dead.

His doctor stated that is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and Mr Bean has not returned to work.

Terror: The massacre by 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza, a former Sandy Hook student, was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. A police officer leads two women and a child during the attack

Relief: Demolition of Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, began on Friday. The school was the scene of a deadly massacre in December 2012

But Chief Michael Kehoe wrote to Mr Bean that he received notice that he is '100 percent permanently disabled from performing the essential functions of your job as a police officer.'

Mr Kehoe asked Mr Bean to meet with him 'to discuss the issue of whether termination of your employment is necessary due to the medical disability and your options if that is true.'

'They haven't given him many options. It's either quit and get nothing, retire and get nothing or we will fire you and you get nothing,' Newtown police union President Scott Ruszczyk told Courant.

Union officials said they expect Mr Bean to be dimissed because the town does not want to pick up the cost of paying half of his salary until he is eligible to retire - that is what they say is mandated by the union contract, reported News Times.

Mr Bean has been receiving long-term disability benefits, but the town's insurance police will only cover two years of long-term disability.

'The town tried to pinch some pennies by buying the wrong type of insurance policy, ' said Eric Brown, attorney for the Newtown Police Union, reported NBC.

'Tom acknowledges, based on his own reports, that he's probably not going to be able to come back to work. The question is what type of benefit is he entitled to?' Mr Brown said.

Last month the demolition of Sandy Hook Elementary School began under a cloak of secrecy and security to discourage ghoulish souvenir-hunters.

Officials hope it will be completely dismantled by the one-year anniversary of the attack.

The town has required the workers handling the tear down of the building to sign agreements banning them from discussing any aspect of the work as Newtown officials attempt to fade out of the media spotlight that hit the commuter suburb after the December 14 attack.
