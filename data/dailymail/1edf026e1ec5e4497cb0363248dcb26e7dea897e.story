Beijing officials this week warned children and the elderly to stay indoors due severe smog.

It has become a major problem in China's capital city and elsewhere in the country - forcing closures, damaging health and reducing visibility to less than 10 metres. 

The solution, according to Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde, is to use an electronic vacuum cleaner to clean up the air.

Roosegaarde has been working with the mayor of Beijing to use the technology in a new park in the city, according to Dezeen. 

The system uses copper coils to create an electrostatic field that attracts smog particles to clean the air.

This creates holes of clean air through the smog which can be as large as 60 metres, according to Mr Roosegaarde. 

‘It's a similar principle to if you have a statically charged balloon that attracts your hair,’ Mr Roosegaarde told Dezeen.

Daan Roosegaarde has developed an 'electronic vacuum cleaner' that can remove smog from urban skies and is working with the mayor of Beijing to use the technology in a new park in the city

‘If you apply that to smog, to create fields of static electricity of ions, which literally attract or magnetise the smog so it drops down so you can clean it, like an electronic vacuum cleaner.’

By
 making a weak electromagnetic field (similar like static electricity 
that attracts your hair) the smog components in the air are pulled down 
to the ground where they can be cleaned.

This creates gigantic holes of clean air in the sky, which can be as large as 60 metres, according to Roosegaarde.  

The coils can be buried beneath the grass of a park and are release no toxic residues.

He added that the coils can be buried beneath the grass of a park and release no toxic residues.

This combination of high-tech and imagination is what Mr Roosegaarde calls ‘techno-poetry’. 

Mr Roosegaarde's company has been working with scientists at the University of Delft to unveil a working prototype of the system.

He now plans to spend a year and a half developing the technology before deploying it in a park in Beijing.

The
 Shanghai and Netherlands-based designer has also been working on 
intricate designs like a sustainable dance floor which generates 
electricity when you dance, and smart highways which produce their own 
light.

The Chinese government has announced plans over the years to tackle the pollution problem but has made little apparent progress

Meanwhile, visibility shrank and small-particle pollution soared to a record 40 times higher than an international safety standard in one Chinese city as the region entered its high-smog season.

Winter typically brings the worst air pollution to northern China because of a combination of weather conditions and an increase in the burning of coal for homes and municipal heating systems.

For the large northern city of Harbin, the city's heating systems kicked in on Sunday, and on Monday visibility there was less than 50 yards, according to state media.
