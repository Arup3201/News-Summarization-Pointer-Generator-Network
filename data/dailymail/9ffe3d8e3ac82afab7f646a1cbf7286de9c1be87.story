Tens of thousands of air travellers left stranded by a major computer glitch this weekend are set to be denied compensation because of an EU loophole, this newspaper has been told.

Airlines are claiming that an ‘unprecedented’ IT failure at the UK’s national air traffic control centre – which threw the travel plans of 120,000 people into chaos – was ‘beyond their control’. This will enable them to sidestep regulations which say passengers are entitled to up to £470 for cancelled and severely delayed flights.

A spokesman for the airline easyJet said last night that passengers were entitled to refunds or free rebooking of flights, but added: ‘As this is an exceptional circumstance, compensation does not apply.’ And a British Airways spokeswoman said: ‘Yesterday’s events were outside of British Airways’ control.’

Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, has launched an investigation and told The Mail on Sunday: ‘These passengers have been severely inconvenienced through no fault of their own and should have the right to be recompensed.

‘We will be investigating two things: firstly what went wrong, how it happened and how it can be stopped; and secondly, how passengers were treated – whether they were given enough information and looked after properly. This includes compensation.’

Friday’s chaos continued to have a knock-on effect yesterday with 54 flights cancelled at Heathrow and Gatwick. Following an urgent investigation at its £700million headquarters yesterday, a spokesman for Nats – the company in charge of UK air traffic control – revealed that the problem had been caused when part of a computer system holding flight path data became overloaded. This led it to shut down unexpectedly at 3.27pm on Friday.

While air traffic controllers at the base in Swanwick, Hampshire, could still communicate with pilots and track planes in the sky, they could no longer see what altitude or route each aircraft was scheduled to take – forcing airspace over London to be shut down for 40 minutes.

‘It has never happened before – it’s something completely new,’ the spokesman said last night as engineers continued to investigate the problem.

The delays, caused by an IT glitch, threw the travel plans of 120,000 people into chaos

Consumer expert Guy Anker, from the website moneysavingexpert.com, said: ‘The airline can get out of paying compensation if it’s the case that cancellations and delays were caused by “extraordinary circumstances”.

‘EU rules around compensation only apply to the airlines so if it’s a problem that is beyond their control then consumers won’t get any money beyond hotel and food expenses.’

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who described the disruption as ‘unacceptable’, will be questioned on the issue when he appears before the Transport Select Committee tomorrow.

This weekend’s problems came a year after a telephone failure at Nats’ control room also caused huge disruption – one of a number of technical hitches to hit the part-privatised operation since its Swanwick centre opened in 2002.
