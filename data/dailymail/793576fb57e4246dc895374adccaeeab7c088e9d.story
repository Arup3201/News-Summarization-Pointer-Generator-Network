The Wisconsin father who killed his three young girls to get revenge on his ex-wife has been sentenced to life in prison without parole.

A jury ruled that Aaron Schaffhausen- who called his wife saying ‘you can come home now, I killed the kids’- was sane at the time of the July 2012 triple murder but he was only today that he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Schaffhausen, 35, had admitted he killed 11-year-old Amara, 8-year-old Sophie and 5-year-old Cecilia at their River Falls home to get back at his ex-wife, but argued he had a mental defect that kept him from knowing it was wrong.

Life sentences were mandatory in each 
girl's death, but Schaffhausen had the prospect of supervised release 
after at least 20 years in prison.

That
was rejected by St. Croix County Circuit Judge Howard Cameron, who 
said: 'I don't see mental illness as a mitigating factor.'

'This is a vicious, aggravated crime,' Cameron said before handing down the sentence.

The judge chose consecutive life sentences to send a message that 'each child is so important.'

Evidence showed that Schaffhausen texted his ex-wife on July 10, 2012, to ask for an unscheduled visit with the girls.

 She
consented but said he had to be gone before she got home because she 
didn't want to see him. The girls' baby sitter told investigators the 
children were excited when he arrived, and the sitter left.

He called his ex-wife, Jessica Schaffhausen, about two hours later, saying: 'You can come home now, I killed the kids.'

Tragic lives taken too soon: Amara, 11, five-year-old Cecilia and eight-year-old Sophie (left to right) were all supposedly happy to see their father when he showed up for the unexpected visit

Police
arrived to find the girls lying in their beds, their throats slit and 
their blankets pulled up to their necks. White T-shirts were tied around
their necks. Cecilia's body also showed signs of strangulation.

As he did throughout his trial, Aaron Schaffhausen sat impassively as family members and attorneys read their statements.

Jessica
Schaffhausen's sister, Mary Elizabeth Stotz, described Aaron 
Schaffhausen as 'the darkness, the boogeyman' that every child fears.

'He took their unconditional love for him, and used that love to lure them to get close enough (to) kill them,' Stotz said.

'Their last memory was what an evil killer their dad was.'

Eryn
Schlotte, the girls' cousin, said Schaffhausen took away from her 'the 
future of seeing them smile, and what I had to look forward to when 
school got out.

Charged: Lawyers for Schaffhausen, 35, of Minot, North Dakota,initially tried to say that he was insane at the time of the triple murders but the court overruled that ploy

'I thought 
the world was a better place than this. Not a place where someone got 
killed before they were even in kindergarten or middle school.'

With
family members crying and sharing tissues, lead prosecutor Gary 
Freyberg read his statement, saying Schaffhausen used the girls 'as 
pawns ... to make Jessica suffer.'

'How
wrong is it to use his intellect, his size and his brute strength not 
to protect his children from danger, but to become the most dangerous 
person in the world to them?' he asked.

Freyberg
said consecutive life sentences with no possibility of release was the 
only way for Jessica Schaffhausen to be free of fear that her ex-husband
would someday come for her.

Schaffhausen argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his dependency on his ex-wife Jessica, seen here in an old photo with their youngest daughter Cecilia as a baby

Trial
testimony showed that in the months leading up to the killings, 
Schaffhausen told several people he had thoughts of killing his 
daughters.

His ex-wife 
testified that in March 2012, he called her from Minot, North Dakota — 
where he was working — and told her he 'wanted to drive down there and 
tie me up and make me pick which child he killed and make me watch while
he killed them.'

He also called his ex-wife repeatedly, sometimes up to 30 times a day, and threatened to kill the man she was dating.

Schaffhausen
didn't testify at his trial. His defense attorney argued at trial that 
Schaffhausen has a rare mental disorder rooted in deep dependency on his
ex-wife, and believed the only way he could 'solve' his problem was to 
commit suicide or homicide.

The jury rejected his insanity defense.
