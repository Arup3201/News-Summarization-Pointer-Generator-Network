If you have ever wondered how common your birthday is, look no further.

A U.S. graduate has produced a series of charts revealing how birthdays rate against each other.

The graphs, created from  federal government data, show that most American babies are born in the late summer, while the least are delivered on major holidays.

Revealed: A U.S. graduate has produced three charts revealing how birthdays rate against each other. They show that most American babies are born in late summer, while the least are delivered on major holidays

Perhaps unsurprisingly, September 12, 18, 25 and 26 - which are all around nine months after the holiday season - were found to be the most common days for births.

They helped make up a total of 12,250 children born per day in the summer, compared to just 11,390 in the winter.

This contrast in numbers is widely believed to be due to the cold weather experienced during the winter months, which encourages more people to stay indoors and spend cosy evenings in.

University of Viriginia student Dan Lin produced the charts using data from 1994-2003 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records, before posting them to Reddit.

Interesting: Public holidays - including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Day and the Fourth of July, as well as the February 29 - were ranked as the least-likely days for births. But Valentine's Day was popular

They show that public holidays - including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Day and the Fourth of July, as well as the February 29 - are the least-likely days for births.

While February 29 is understandably rare as it comes around only every four years, the cause for the fewest birthdays on holidays is likely due to fewer cesarean sections being carried out.

Most public hospitals in America refuse to schedule c-sections on national holidays - with the exception of emergencies - while many private hospitals will arrange fewer.

Reddit users have also speculated  that some doctors may deliberately induce a pregnancy so the birth occurs on a more convenient day.

Standing out: University of Viriginia student Dan Lin produced the charts using data from 1994-2003 CDC records. Strikingly, the day with the most American births was found to be September 9, 1999 - or 9/9/99

Despite the apparent lack of births of public holidays, Valentine's Day and Friday the 13th were ranked among the most common for deliveries, with an average of 12,210 and 11,210 respectively.

Strikingly, the day with the most American births was found to be September 9, 1999 - possibly due to a high number of parents wanting their child to have a 9/9/99 birth date.

While July, August and September appeared to be the most popular months to give birth, Tuesday was ranked as the most likely day for newborn deliveries.

Sunday was  the least likely day to give birth, with just 7,780.
