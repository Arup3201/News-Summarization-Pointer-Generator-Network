How to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Felicity Jones’s arms

On the Baftas red carpet, actress Felicity Jones, 31, displayed perfectly toned arms. Yet The Theory Of Everything star says she has a relaxed attitude to working out.

‘I’ve found this amazing exercise place called Frame, in East London,’ she says. ‘There’s loads of classes — my favourite is box fit. I swim, too, and do yoga to unwind.’

Style: Felicity Jones showed off her toned arms at the EE British Academy Film Awards last month

What to try: The triceps kickback. Stand with your right side against a bench or dining chair, with your right hand on the bench and a dumb-bell or bottle of water in your left hand. With the left upper arm parallel to your body and your elbow at a right angle, straighten the arm by taking the dumb-bell or water past your thigh behind you. Try to extend your shoulder slightly.

Bend the arm back to the start position and repeat 12 to 15 times, then swap sides and do likewise with the other arm.
