For party-going Prince Harry, his 30th birthday party was always going to be a night to remember.

And the Duchess of Cambridge is planning an event he will likely never forget by turning one room of Kensington Palace into a nightclub with the help of Guy Pelly - the owner of London hotspot Tonteria.

However the guest list may raise a few eyebrows, as Kate is believed to have invited two of Harry's ex-girlfriends, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy, to the celebration on September 15.

And once there they may well bump into  Camilla Thurlow, who the Prince was spotted kissing last month, as she is also thought to have been invited.

Prince Harry is said to be relaxed about the thought of two of his ex-girlfriends being invited to his 30th birthday party on September 15 which is being organised by the Duchess of Cambridge and old friend Guy Pelly

Cressida Bonas, 25, who split from Prince Harry in April this year, and Chelsy Davy, 28, who dated the prince on-and-off between 2004 and 2010, are both said to be invited to his 30th birthday

According to the Daily Mirror, Prince Harry has no problem with seeing Cressida, 25, or Chelsy, 28, at his birthday bash as he has remained firm friends with both.

Harry split from Cressida in April this year shortly after attending his first official engagement with her. At the time a friend said that the split was 'amicable' and that they would be keeping in touch.

Chelsy, a Zimbabwean landowner's daughter, and Harry dated on-off for six years between 2004 and 2010 before she decided a Royal life was 'not for me', and the two parted ways. 

Also believed to be on the guest list is Camilla Thurlow, 25, a former Miss Edinburgh who Harry was spotted 'in a clinch' with last month

Kate and Mr Pelly, 32, are said to be inviting a cocktail mixologist and sexy dancers along to the palace to complete their nightclub theme.

Mr Pelly has plenty of experince organising high-end parties. His current nightclub in Sloane Square features latex-clad dancers, £28,000 bottles of champagne, and a toy train suspended from the ceiling which delivers tequila shots to tables.

Prince Harry is said to be a regular visitor, getting in through a secret entrance from Sloane Square Hotel to void the press, and was once spotted at the club on three occasions in one week.

In fact it was at Tonteria, in July this year, that Harry was spotted 'in a clinch' with Miss Thurlow, 25, a former Miss Edinburgh who is also thought to be invited to his birthday party.

The pair apparently had 'a few drinks' and kissed in front of friends at the Mexican bar, though friends played down the relationship, saying it was just a case of two young people having fun.

The pair met through the Halo Trust, where Miss Thurlow works as a project officer in Siem Reap, Cambodia. 

The Trust is a mine clearance charity with which Diana, Princess of Wales, was heavily involved.

The charity, which conducts humanitarian landmine clearance and ordnance disposal operations, was made famous by Diana in 1997 when she visited a minefield in Angola.

The prince himself later become a patron of the charity, but left in March this year.

Mr Pelly's other clubs also include Mahiki, another favourite of both Prince Harry and Prince William, Whisky Mist and the controversial Public.

Guy was originally William’s friend as they are the same age and met in 2001 when both were junior members of the Beaufort Hunt.

Guy Pelly, 32, who owns Sloane Square club Tonteria (pictured), is helping Kate to organise the 'nightclub' theme and is thought to be bringing sexy dancers and a cocktail mixologist to the palace

However Stowe-educated Pelly, whose sculptor mother Vanda is a member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty, soon became close to Harry.

While he was known for a time as a trouble-maker among the Royal household, he is now thought of as a third brother.

While the party he is organising for Harry was initially supposed to be a secret, it is thought Harry is now aware of the plans and very happy with who will be attending.

While the party will likely be lavish, Harry himself has said he does not want birthday gifts and has instead asked for donations to his Walking With The Wounded charity.
