Billy Connolly blew a raspberry down the phone as his doctor delivered the devastating news that he had both cancer and Parkinson's disease.

The comedian was standing in his living room when the surgery called - and his instinct was to laugh.

'I remember I went through to the 
bedroom to answer the phone, and Pamela was behind me - I thought she 
was going to catch me,' he said.

'She sort of held me, and I went, "Oh, Jesus..."'

'But when we went into the living room I went: "Phrrhrht" [blowing a raspberry].

'I think they're very closely related, deep despair and laughing.'

Ever
 unconventional, the Glaswegian also revealed in an interview with the 
Radio Times that he is treating his Parkinson’s with crosswords instead 
of taking medication.

The
 comedian has revealed that he doesn’t want to rely on the drugs 
prescribed by doctors so instead he challenges himself to word puzzles 
to stave off memory loss caused by the degenerative condition.

'I've put myself on a strict regime of crossword books,' he said.

'They remind me of everything. I have to train my memory.

'I have got a notebook with all the words I tend to forget. It’s the same ones cropping up again and again. The drugs can increase the signs, give you the Parkinson’s face – expressionless, sort of slack.'

The comedian, pictured with his wife Pamela in 2002, now self-medicates by doing crosswords, he revealed

The Glaswegian was given the all-clear from cancer last year but there is no cure for Parkinson's disease

It is 'early days' with the disease, 
he said, and his doctor will 'put me back on them [the drugs] when the 
symptoms come back’.

Last
 September the 71-year-old announced he had undergone surgery for 
prostate cancer and was being treated for the early symptoms of 
Parkinson’s, a neurological disorder which affects the central nervous 
system and brain.

While Connolly was given the all-clear from cancer last year, there is no cure for Parkinson’s.

The
 Glaswegian said he sometimes suffers from shaking hands during moments 
of strain but has made the symptoms part of his stage act.

He
 confessed that he has not written a will, something which he insists 
has the approval of his wife, actress turned psychologist, Pamela 
Stephenson.

And he said he dismissed any talk of dying when it was brought up by doctors. ‘When he [the doctor] said, “First of all, you’re not going to die”, I was shocked. I said: “Of course I’m not going to f****** die!” It never crossed my mind. It was all very businesslike.’

But Connolly is not letting his health woes slow down his stellar career.

He is currently on a world stand-up tour and recently filmed scenes for the final Hobbit film, as well as an ITV documentary, Billy Connolly’s Big Send Off, which airs next month.

He will also tour the UK later this year but no details of dates have yet been revealed.

Connolly has denied that Parkinson’s has caused momentary memory loss on stage.

Of a show last year when he was accused of forgetting his lines, he said: ‘Oh that was bulls***! I have lost my train of thought  all my career! It’s what makes me different from everybody else; “Where was I, what was I saying?”

‘I just ramble off and come back ages later. I once had a guy following me from [a gig in] Morecambe to get the second half of a story. Eventually he got it in Blackpool.’
