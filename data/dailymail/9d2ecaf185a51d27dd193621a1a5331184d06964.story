Notorious gangster: Frankie Fraser died today at 90

Notorious gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser died in hospital today aged 90, relatives have revealed.

The criminal, who has spent almost half his life in prison, passed away earlier at King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, after falling critically ill.

His family decided to withdraw life support for Fraser - infamous for pulling out rivals' teeth with a pair of pliers - this morning after he was induced into a coma in the intensive care unit following complications during the operation.

His son Dave, 66, told the Daily Mirror: ‘We’re just glad he’s not in pain and isn’t suffering any more. He had a good innings and fought until the end but it was just too much for him.’

The news of his death was also confirmed by his ex-associate Eddie Richardson, who said: 'He's had a long life and I don't think he's done too bad. He had Alzheimer's for about three years, so I don't think he knew what day it was.'

It is believed Fraser had gone into hospital for a hip operation but doctors spotted he had a fractured left leg two weeks later.

Fraser had been one of the last surviving ‘celebrity criminals’ after he joined turf wars between London gangs in the sixties.

He was a member of the Richardson gang or the 'torture gang', led by brothers Charlie and Eddie Richardson, and were widely feared in London’s underworld.

Prior to that he was a bodyguard to notorious gangland leader Billy Hill, where he took part in bank robberies and carried out razor blade attacks - which earned him £50 a time. 

He has spent 42 years - almost half his life - in jail for 26 offences. The former gangland leader was handed an Asbo last year after flying into a rage with a fellow pensioner at his care home.

Staff called police after things got heated between Fraser and the 87-year-old man, who has dementia, after he found him sitting in his favourite seat.

He was admitted to sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, south-east London, just a few miles from haunts during his criminal career, when living along became 'too much for him', his family said.

Fraser's ghost writer James Morton said in The Guardian that over his lifetime the gangster had turned from ‘the scourge of prison governors and warders up and down Britain’ to a minor celebrity.

‘People shook his hand in the street, others kissed him or asked for his autograph and taxi drivers honked their horns,’ Mr Morton wrote.

The gangster claimed to have spent time in every prison in the country. Born in 1923 in Cornwall Road, the baby of his family, Fraser found his calling early in life.

'I began stealing early on and bringing it home, saying I'd found £1 or £2,' he said in his memoirs.

'My mother would say she had the luckiest children, but she would not tell my father because he would have made me take the money down to the police station.'

The son of a merchant seaman and a cleaner, Fraser often spoke of his fondness for the days when women and children were untouchable and criminals were only a danger to one another.

In a 1994 interview with The Independent, he appeared chuffed to have been dubbed Britain's most dangerous man by not one but two home secretaries.

'Whether I merited that honour, I don't know. Sure I was violent, but only to people like myself ... I suppose I ranked high. I'm quite proud of that,' he said then.

A life of crime: How Fraser spent almost half his years in jail after a career spanning the Krays and a nursing home Asbo

He was one of the last surviving 'celebrity criminals' after becoming involved in turf wars between London gangs in the Sixties.

'Mad' Frankie Fraser, who served 42 years in prison for 26 offences, was notorious for his torture methods which involved pulling out enemies teeth with pliers.

The 90-year-old former gangster, a grandfather and father-of-four, died today.

Fraser was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the Richardson gang, where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal

He had been admitted to King's College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, for a hip operation but went into a coma last Friday following complications during surgery.

Born Francis Fraser, in Lambeth, central London, he has admitted committing crime since he was nine - when he and his sister Eva would steal anything they could.

'You name it, we nicked it,' he said in a documentary of his life - Frankie Fraser’s Last Stand, aired last year.

He was charged with his first crime at the age of 13, when he stole a packet of cigarettes and was sent to an approved school.

What officers in 1936 did not know then was that his crime spree would continue over a career spanning seven decades.

Fraser also worked for notorious gang leader Billy Hill (pictured) who paid him £50 to carry out razor attacks

He earned his title as 'Mad' Frankie, during the Second World War, when he feigned a mental illness to avoid being called up to the front line.

After being released from jail in the Eighties, Frankie Fraser met girlfriend Marilyn Wisbey - daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wisbey - and they were together until 2001.

This was despite Fraser already having a girlfriend, Val, and also a wife, Doreen. 

He was a father to four sons - Frank, David, Patrick and Francis. 

One grandson was footballer Tommy Fraser, a former Brighton and Hove Albion, Port Vale and Barnet midfielder who most recently turned out for non-league Peacehaven & Telscombe in East Sussex.

The Daily Mail reported in 2008 how the player - who also turned out for Melbourne Knights in Australia - had earned notoriety among team-mates for his links to gangland Britain.

Frankie Fraser himself was an Arsenal fan, while another of his grandsons, James Fraser, signed a short-term contract for Bristol Rovers - and played for non-league Worthing.

In addition, a third grandson, Anthony Fraser, was arrested in Gibraltar in 2011 over an alleged drug-smuggling plot after a police manhunt. Officials extradited him to Britain - but it’s not clear whether he ever went on trial.

Anthony Fraser is the son of Frank Junior, who was jailed for four years in 1999 for possessing cocaine with intent to supply.

Another of Frankie Fraser’s sons, David, was also jailed for drugs offences, while grandson Jamie was sent to prison for armed robbery. 

Frankie Fraser had two other sons, called Patrick and  Francis - with the latter being the only one who never went to jail.

He then became involved in serious crime - and the war provided a perfect backdrop with the blackout, rationing and a shortage of police officers.

At 17 he was sent to borstal for breaking and entering a hosiery shop in Waterloo, central London, and was then given a 15-month prison sentence for shopbreaking.

After the war he was involved in a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller's and was given a two year prison sentence.

In the 1950s he worked for underworld boss Billy Hill and carried out razor attacks on victims for £50 each.

He later joined the notorious Richardson gang, formed by brothers Eddie and Charlie, and began carrying out more criminal activities.

They set up a fruit machine enterprise, which they would sell to pub landlords, to cover up their crimes.

In 1966 he was charged with the murder of Richard Hart, who was shot at a club in Catford, south-east London, but the charges were dropped when a witness changed their testimony.

The following year he was involved in a torture trial at the Old Bailey, where members of the gang were charged with electrocuting, whipping and burning those disloyal to them.

Fraser himself was charged with pulling out people's teeth with pliers and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

During his time behind bars he was involved in violence and was a major instigator in the Parkhurst Prison riots on the Isle of Wight in 1969. Each incident added more time to his sentence.

His last jail term ended in 1989, but in 2011 he was handed an Asbo after getting into an argument with a fellow pensioner at his sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, south-east London.

He has spent 42 years in prison for 26 offences. His first offence was stealing a pack of cigarettes when he was 13. Here he is pictured greeting Reggie Kray at the funeral of his older brother Charles Junior in 2000

Even as a pensioner the gangster was unable to keep out of trouble and last year was given an Asbo after he got into an argument with an 87-year-old man for sitting in his favourite armchair at their care home
