Preventing your mind from wandering from an important task may be as simple as putting on a pair of glasses.

The inventor of smart spectacles called Narbis, claim they can train your brain to stay focused.

They use sensors to monitor a wearer’s brainwaves and alert them if they start to daydream and let their attention drift elsewhere.

Wear glasses to concentrate: The inventor of smart spectacles called Narbis (pictured), which use dry sensors to monitor a wearer’s brainwaves, claim they can train your brain to stay focused

The glasses do this by darkening the lenses to bring the wearer’s mind back to the task at hand.

When they start paying attention again, the lenses clear.

Devon Greco, the inventor of Narbis, claims that with repeated use, the glasses can train a person’s brain to focus for longer periods of time as well as help them relax and get a good night’s sleep.

The 28-year-old, explained: 'The Narbis' sleep training programme is designed to improve the performance of a brain pattern known as SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) which is related to relaxation.

The glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology, which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head (illustrated right), to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness. An app will record a user's progress in improving their concentration

Narbis is a headset that uses sensors to measure a user’s brain patterns and send these signals to a set of electrochromic lenses.

When a wearer’s attention drifts, the lenses darken and when they focus, the specs clear.

Users will be able to train their brains by practicing keeping the lenses clear. The idea is that with work, they will be able to stay focused for longer and even learn how to shift into a state of focus at will.

By doing two 30-minutes training sessions a week, they will start to see improvements in their brain's overall performance, Mr Greco’s Kickstarter page claims.

‘Through repeated training sessions, you can learn how to encourage good habits and discourage bad ones,’ it says.

‘The calming program is designed to help manage stress by regulating the level of alpha and theta waves which have been linked to anxiety, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.’

The glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology, which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head, to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness.

Mr Greco, from Paoli in Pennsylvania, said: ‘Neurofeedback has proven to be a useful tool in helping people improve their concentration, sleep, memory, anxiety and self-esteem.'

‘Narbis brings neurofeedback out of the clinical setting and into your living room, office, air plane seat, park bench or anywhere you are.’

Mr Greco’s Kickstarter page says: ‘By doing just two short training sessions a week, you can improve your brain's performance’ and that just 10 sessions are needed before users start noticing a difference in their ability to concentrate.'

Narbis will come with five training sessions: one to boost a person's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information, one to boost creativity and hand-eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily.

Users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a Bluetooth connection –as well as the glasses, which have three sensors attatched

The Narbis system uses neurofeedback, which is described as exercise for the brain.

The neurofeedback technology in the glasses relays information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head, to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness.

Studies have shown that neurofeedback training increases neuroplasticity, or the brain’s ability to form connections between brain cells, according to Mr Greco.

The training has been proven to significantly improve people's day to day lives by helping with concentration, sleep, anxiety, memory, self-esteem, fine motor skills, and overall mood.

‘Significant results have been achieved in slowing the cognitive effects of ageing and improving learning challenges with lasting effects,’ the Kickstarter page says. 

There will also be a programme to boost self-confidence and self-awareness, as well as managing stress more effectively.

Users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a Bluetooth connection – and will be able to monitor their progress in exercises using an accompanying app and set goals for themselves.

The neurofeedback system was originally developed by Mr Greco’s parents, Domenic and Lindsay Greco, in partnership with Nasa.

In 2009, Domenic was diagnosed with the degenerative disease ALS but continued to work on the Neurofeedback system with his son until he died in 2013.

‘It was the best opportunity of my life to work with my father on developing neurofeedback systems,’ Devon Greco said.

‘I couldn't have asked for a better partner and mentor. My father was a leader in his field and a true visionary.’

He is raising money to put his glasses into production on crowd sourcing website Kickstarter, where they can be pre-ordered from $295 (£199).

‘Narbis development is completed and we are ready to begin production,’ he said.
