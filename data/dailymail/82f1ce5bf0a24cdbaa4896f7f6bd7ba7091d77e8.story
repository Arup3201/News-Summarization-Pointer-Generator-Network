Norway could do little to stop Estonia from beating them in Oslo, even after 15-year-old prodigy Martin Odegaard came on as a second-half substitute. 

The visitors scored the opener through attacking midfielder Konstanin Vassiljev in the 24th minute, and held on to their slender 1-0 lead despite the home side  threatening after the break.

Norwegian wonderkid Odegaard could not rescue his team from defeat after coming on with half an hour left, but the youngster was given plenty of time to impress those tracking his every move.

Odegaard, dubbed the 'Norwegian Messi' by some, recently admitted Liverpool are his 'dream club' ahead of visiting the facilities of the Barclays Premier League club in December.

He has already trained with Bundesliga sides Bayern Munich and Stuttgart, met Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp and visited La Liga giants Real Madrid.

On Wednesday night, Odegaard was given some 30 minutes to make his mark by Per-Mathias Hogmo, though his creative spark was wasted as his team-mates could not find the finishing touch.

Odegaard himself had a late chance to equalise after cutting sharply inside, only to see his shot fly over the crossbar.  

The statistics suggest this match was one-sided.

Norway had 15 shots to Estonia's seven, but the visitors never allowed the hosts to get back into the match during a tense second half. 

Vassiljev's opener was as simple as they come, too, and  Norway goalkeeper Orjan Nyland will feel he could have done far better.

Meeting a cut back pass from the left flank, Estonia's utility player Vassiljev side-footed the ball towards goal, proving too fierce for Nyland between the sticks.

Hogmo is now under pressure. His team are currently third in Group H with six points, three behind leaders Croatia and Italy, as they head to Baku to face Azerbaijan on Sunday.

With just three points from their opening three games, Estonia are second from bottom in Group E. 

They travel to play bottom side San Marino, who have yet to score a goal in qualifying, on Saturday.
