Ian Ousey (outside court today), 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia when he fleeced the media company so he could keep up with instalments on his dream home in Portugal

A former executive at the company behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent was jailed for 40 months today for stealing £225,000 from the producer to pay for his holiday home.

Ian Ousey, 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia when he fleeced the media company so he could keep up with instalments on his dream home in Portugal.

He submitted false invoices for four years and was only caught out when senior colleagues spotted a gaping hole in the firm’s finances and launched an audit.

Suspicious transactions were discovered in 2012 by FremantleMedia’s group financial director Mark Riddleston.

The company credit card was also used to pay for vehicles, mobile phones and other unauthorised expenses.

But a charge relating to the corporate card was dropped when investigators failed to distinguish legitimate claims from potentially fraudulent ones.

Ousey, who lives in a £1.9million five-bedroom detached home in Ascot, Berkshire, has since paid back the full amount he stole, as well as £1million to cover the cost of FremantleMedia’s internal inquiry.

He is also believed to have surrendered his full pension to the company.

Today, prosecutor James Benson said the fraudster spent thousands on ‘flights to Brazil and Australia and so on and so forth’.

Mr Benson revealed Ousey has already repaid FremantleMedia £1.25million after civil proceedings were launched against him.

The sum included the false invoices, plus abuses of the company expenses system and the cost of the internal auditing procedure, the court heard.

Sentencing him, Judge Peter Clarke noted Ousey had damaged ‘his family life and his self-respect and the respect with which he is held by his spouse and children’.

He said it was highly unlikely Ousey would work again as a chartered accountant, adding he ‘could not contemplate the question of a suspended sentence’.

Samuel Parish, defending, said Ousey, who worked for FremantleMedia for 23 years, began siphoning money from the company when he could not afford payments on his holiday home.

The barrister said his client’s career was ‘finished’.

‘He is extremely remorseful about it, not just because he has been found out but because of the disgrace he has put brought onto his family and himself.

‘He has kicked himself well and truly in the teeth.

‘He’s been to Portugal with his wife, he’s decided to buy a property which he had to pay for in instalments.

‘At the last stretch there was some hiccup and he was unable to make the final instalment, the conditions were such that if he was unable to pay he would have lost the whole lot.

‘He submitted a false invoice for a company that did not exist but which had a similar name to a company that did supply to [FremantleMedia].

‘He’s stated that he couldn’t stop, but he’s paid everything back.’

He added: ‘He’s a man with children in paid schools, and his whole way of life has gone completely.

‘He can’t get a job, he’s had to inform his professional body and has been struck off their rolls.’

Mr Parish added: ‘And now what he is most worried about is the welfare of his family because he’s left them in really difficult circumstances, and Mr Ousey would like to get this dealt with as soon as possible.’

Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry.

He trained at accounting firm PwC in the 1980s before taking a job in Monaco with Grundy Worldwide, the Australian production company behind Neighbours, the long-running daytime soap opera.

Ousey then went on to work for the European entertainment giant RTL when it bought out Grundy, and then FremantleMedia when the companies merged.

After leaving the company last year, he was made redundant from a rival firm in April and then worked as a self-employed consultant.

On his online social networking LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as ‘a highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome’.

Ousey admitted fraud by abuse of position between October 30, 2008 and November 30, 2012.
