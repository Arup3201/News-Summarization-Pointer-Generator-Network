A schoolboy is scarred for life after his foot slipped into an uncovered drain in the playground filled with toxic chemicals.

Fabio Smith, nine, lost the skin off his left foot and his family feared doctors would have to amputate because his flesh was so badly damaged.

His horrified mother has hit out after being told the drain was full of strong chemical stripper used to take paint off a nearby fence.

'Like a piece of raw meat': Fabio Smith's foot was badly injured when his leg went into a drain filled with toxic chemicals at his school

Painful: Fabio with his mother Nikita at their home in Llanishen, Cardiff, South Wales, after the incident at primary school

Nikita Payne said Fabio's foot looked like 'raw meat' after he stepped in to the uncovered drain during playtime at his primary school.

School staff only told him to rinse his foot in cold water - and he continued wearing his chemical-soaked shoe and sock for the rest of the day.

He was taken to hospital by his worried mum Nikita, 25, the next day when the skin on his left foot turned black and started to bubble up.

Fabio was transferred to a special burns unit where doctors diagnosed toxic chemical burns.

An investigation was under way at Rhiwbina Primary School in Cardiff and samples have been taken from the drain.

Shocking: This was the drain filled with toxic stripper that gave nine-year-old Fabio such horrifying burns

Care assistant Nikita said: 'He was so frightened and he asked me if they would have to cut his foot off.

'You don't expect this to happen in a playground of all places. You expect your kid to be safe in school.'

His mum said it is believed chemicals had been used to strip a neighbouring fence- and it may have run into the drain.

Fears: Fabio will be scarred for life and his mum was worried the foot might have to be amputated

The drain was covered with leaves when young Fabio stepped in to it accidentally.

'His foot looks terrible, the skin was just bubbled completely and it was black,' Nikita said.

'It's absolutely horrendous, you can't imagine what it looks like. It's like a piece of raw meat.

'Fabio started crying at the shock of seeing his foot and I was in tears because it looked so severe.

'He was really scared of the doctors touching it because it hurt anyway and they had to peel the skin away from his foot which was really painful.

'He's going to be permanently scarred and I'm also worried about what psychological scars he'll be left with after seeing the hospital peel off his skin.

'I can't help him with the pain and I can't take the memories away.'

Fabio is on crutches and doctors say it will be take two months before he can walk on it again.

But he may need more surgery and has been told he will never be able to expose the skin to strong sunlight.

Fabio said: 'It felt a bit soggy when I stepped in the drain.

'I was a bit scared when it turned black and it hurt most when they removed the skin.

'I hope that the skin's going to grow back.'

A Cardiff council spokeswoman said the incident was being investigated.

She said: 'The council and the school are working together to investigate an alleged incident which took place in the playground.'
