Jimmy Carr can heave a huge sigh of relief - it has been revealed he is not the only celebrity to avoid handing over large amounts of cash to the tax man.

Today more than 12 million historic tax records spanning 400 years have been released and show the rich and famous from previous centuries were just as adept at keeping money in their pockets and away from the Treasury.

The previously unseen returns from ancestry.co.uk show legendary Britons like Horatio Nelson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Benjamin Disraeli and even King George III paid paltry amounts.

And they didn't need to invest in a sophisticated Jersey-based avoidance scheme like comedian Mr Carr to keep a lot of their cash.

This is because when they lived they only had to pay a small amount of land tax to the Government, despite owning huge houses, mansions and palaces all over Britain. 

Land tax existed from the 17th to the 20th century, before being 
abolished in 1968, and the new collections of returns list the owners and occupiers of 
properties subject to the tax in England and Wales.

The records show King George III, one of Britain's wealthiest and most decadent monarchs, paid £47 in tax for Hampton Court Palace in 1798, the equivalent of £5,166 today, while Nelson paid just £3 in the same year, £316 today, for his house in idyllic Suffolk.

A number of eminent politicians also feature in the records. William Pitt the Younger has three properties listed in Kent in 1798 for which he paid a total of £13, £1,370 today in tax.

Fellow former Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli paid a similar amount of £10 on his Grosvenor Gate property in 1865, equal to £1,030.

And, in 1798, ‘the father of immunology’ and inventor of the smallpox 
vaccine, Edward Jenner, managed to pay the equivalent of just £15 today for a 
property in Gloucester.

Damien Joyce, of anti-tax avoidance group UK Uncut, said he was not surprised by the revelations.

‘The rich and famous have a long and dishonourable tradition of dodging their taxes,’ he told Metro.

But it appears a low tax rate then was not as controversial as the revelations about Jimmy Carr's tax affairs now.

The comedian has made several apologies for paying 
as little as 1% tax thanks to an avoidance scheme.

More than 1,000 people are thought to be using the 
Jersey-based K2 scheme, which is said to be sheltering £168m a year from
the Treasury.

Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson - one 
of our greatest naval heroes, Nelson appears in the records paying £3 in
1798 for a property in Suffolk, the equivalent of £316 today Arthur Conan Doyle - a Scottish author and physician best known for 
penning the Sherlock Holmes detective series. Doyle was taxed £5 (£473 
today) for his abode in Southwark, south London, in 1914.

Edward Jenner - known as “the father of immunology”, the English 
physician and scientist famed for inventing the smallpox vaccine paid 
just 2 shillings and 4 pence in tax for a property in Gloucester in 
1798, around £15 today. 

King George III is listed as paying £47 
tax on the palace at Hampton Court in 1798, the equivalent of £5,166 
today, yet the estate in its entirety was taxed £227 (around £23,933 in 
today’s money).

The archive of 12 million ‘historic council tax’ records from the 17th to the 20th Century have been published online by family history website Ancestry.co.uk.

Ancestry’s international content manager Miriam Silverman said: 'These records will allow millions of people to 
uncover the, often surprising, rates of tax that their ancestors were 
subject to.

'Land Tax was like a ‘council tax’ of the time and these records enable 
us to glimpse into how much was paid by some of Britain’s most famous 
figures - including the King himself.

'They are also useful for people looking to trace their family tree but 
whose relatives may not have been captured in our comprehensive 
collection of census records because they were living before 1841.'

London, England, Land Tax Records, 1692-1932 details four centuries worth of Land Tax returns and, along with the UK, Land Tax Redemption, 1798 collection, provides an insight into the amount of tax paid by our ancestors.

The collections list both the owners and occupiers of properties subject to the tax in England and Wales and show that wealthy landowners who held the vast majority of property were disproportionately affected.

The records also reveal that some owners 
were taxed on businesses or goods and that some public officials, such 
as excise and customs officers, even paid tax on their occupations.
