Separatist groups were staging a general strike across Indian-administered Kashmir today in protest over a fire which gutted a revered Muslim shrine.

At least 30 protesters and 10 policemen were injured in riots by residents angered over what they said was a slow response by firefighters to the blaze.

The cause of the fire at the 200-year-old shrine of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jeelani in the heart of Srinagar city was not immediately known.

Inferno: Kashmiri residents watch as firefighters try to extinguish a fire at the 200-year-old Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jeelani Shrine in Srinagar city

Destructive: The fire broke out at 6.30am on Monday. Protesters are angry at what they claim was a slow response by firefighters to tackle the blaze

Schools, offices, shops and other businesses closed down as a result of the strike.

There was also no public transport, which meant many government employees were unable to get into work.

The blaze started at around 6.30am 
from the roof shortly after morning prayers and quickly engulfed the 
wooden structure, a police official said.

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

The 11th century saint, popularly known worldwide as Ghaus-e-Azam, is buried in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.

Desperate: Residents struggled to help firefighters extinguish the blaze, the cause of which has not yet been established

The shrine, which held his relics, said to be a strand of hair from the saint's beard and a skull cap, has served as an important center of Islamic and spiritual teachings in Kashmir.

'The holy relics are safe and have been retrieved,' the officer said.

Police
and paramilitary soldiers laid razor wire and erected steel barricades 
on roads leading to the shrine where thousands of men and women had 
gathered, many of them wailing and crying.

Scores
of firefighters tried to douse the flames, but protesters threw stones 
at them and burned a fire truck, saying their response was slow.

Thousands later crowded nearby streets, chanting anti-India slogans and demanding Kashmir's freedom from Indian rule.

Clashes
erupted in at least four other neighborhoods in Srinagar, with 
protesters throwing stones at police and officers responding by firing 
bullets into the air and using tear gas, the officer said.

Authorities appealed for calm and ordered a probe into the fire.

'It's
an unfortunate incident. The probe will be completed within a few 
days,' Law Minister Ali Mohammed Sagar told reporters in Srinagar.

Watching in disbelief: Kashmiri residents gather around the shrine, which they claim was not given enough protection. They have also dismissed a government probe into the fire

But separatists rejected the 
government investigation and instead called for an independent inquiry.

'It needs to be thoroughly probed as 
the custodians of the shrine informed us that the fire started in at 
least three places in the shrine,' said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a top 
separatist leader.

'We've no faith in government probes. They always use these tactics to becalm public anger.'

Kashmir is divided between India and 
Pakistan and is claimed by both. Anti-India sentiment runs deep in the 
Indian-administered portion, where rebel groups have fought since 1989 
for independence or merger with Pakistan.

More than 68,000 people have been killed in the uprising and subsequent Indian crackdown.

Anti-government demos: Protesters vented their frustration with rocks and bricks, accusing the government of not doing enough to protect the shrine
