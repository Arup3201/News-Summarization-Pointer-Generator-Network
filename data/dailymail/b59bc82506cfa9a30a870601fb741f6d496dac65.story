A New York teen with a new haircut says he started has day at school feeling good about himself but left shattered when his assistant principal decided to shave his head in the school cafeteria. 

Notre Dame High School student Lucas Hull said many of his fellow seniors were even there to see the haircut.

'Just having people watch and have that done to you,' Lucas, 17, began before having to stop and collect himself. 'It kind of felt humiliating and inhumane and you know, it kind of crushed my spirits for the day.'

His assistant principal said he didn't care for his new look, and took the rest of his hair off with clippers in the cafeteria

13 WHAM reports that he had just gotten a 'faux-hawk' the day before.

While a mohawk would violate the school's policies, Lucas says he asked for permission before getting his hair cut.

'My brother had so much confidence in him that day, and he was just ready to face the world,' said sister Lauren Hull.

But when he got to school the assistant principal called him to the cafeteria and said he didn't approve of the look.  

'He just said you have the choice to either go home or get it cut,' Hull. 'I thought it looked good and I felt good about it and then he started cutting and it felt really bad.'

Mother Denise Hull said it was an over-the-top reaction meant to embarrass her son.

Hull's mother said no one at Notre Dame High School even contacted here about the incident

The administration didn't even call her to tell her what was happening.

'What really upset me even more than the haircut is how much his feelings were hurt for what had happened,' she said. 'I mean here is a good kid.'

She said that since the incident he has been emotionally scarred.

Though they've made complaints they've only received a 'halfhearted apology.'

The school has since released this statement: 'The assistant principal has since apologized to the student, his parents, and the school community for his error in judgment in cutting the student's hair in the student's homeroom before discussing the violation with the student's parents.'

However no action will be taken to reprimand the administrator.
