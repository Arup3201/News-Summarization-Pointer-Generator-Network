New Zealand look determined to teach Stuart Lancaster's weakened England side a lesson as they were put through their paces ahead of Saturday's showdown at Eden Park.

The All Blacks won all 14 of their test matches in 2013, becoming the first team to ever do so, and are looking toward next year's defence of the Rugby World Cup.

Their only loss since that epic win over France three years ago was to England in 2012 but, worryingly for Lancaster without a number of frontline players, New Zealand don't seem keen on suffering a similar fate.

Prepared: New Zealand became the first team in the professional era to complete an unbeaten season in 2013

Lancaster expects the players available for the first test to grasp their opportunity and to measure up to ‘the biggest challenge in world rugby’. That is, playing the All Blacks at home.

New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has had just a few selection issues.

With Dan Carter still unavailable on ‘sabbatical’, the choice for fly half came down to the in-form Beauden Barrett or the more seasoned but out-of-form Aaron Cruden. He opted for the latter, relying on the Chiefs playmaker to find his form under test-match pressure.

Backrower Kieran Read - the World Rugby Player of the Year last season - is sidelined with concussion.

But there is a ready-made replacement at No 8 in 31-year-old veteran Jerome Kaino. He will play his first test since the 2011 World Cup final, having spent two years in Japan before returning to New Zealand this year.

Lock Luke Romano is out with a broken leg and winger Julian Savea has a knee injury, but New Zealand have strong back-up to rely on.

‘There's been a lot of talk in the media about this being a poor England side,’ Hansen said.

‘But when you go through them they've all played internationals in the last 12 months and there are not that many changes from the last time we played them - and that was a great contest.

‘They've clearly got confidence in who they are and what they're doing. Their environment seems to be one of just keeping quiet and get on and do the work, and that makes them dangerous.’

New Zealand are expected to have an advantage due to the sustained pace at which they play the game, and Hansen expects England to counter that with a game based around its forwards and set pieces.

Lancaster has tried to liberate England from that dour style but he lacks players with the ability, or even the ambition, to play attractive rugby for long periods.

He said England had made the transition from an experienced to a less mature side after the 2011 World Cup, and was now used to playing against more-seasoned opponents, adding ‘experience is not the only barometer of what wins and loses games.’
