She had not seen her husband for nine years after he vanished without an explanation in 2005.

So, when Karen Marx finally tracked down her spouse, Adam Marx, via Facebook, she was thrilled.

However, the 48-year-old's joy quickly turned to shock when she realized her long-lost husband was living in the same state as her and was happily married - to someone else.

Disgruntled: Karen Marx (pictured), 48, spent nine years searching for her husband, Adam Marx, after he vanished without an explanation in 2005. But when she finally found him, she discovered he had wed again

New wife: Marx, pictured with his new wife, Marcie, in a Facebook photo, was investigated by police last month. He was later charged with bigamy and fraud , as well as making a false statement on his marriage license

'I just thought, 'How could he get married again?' Ms Marx, from New London, Wisconsin, told Post-Crescent Media. 'Am I dead? What did he do with my identity?'

Following her discovery, the stunned wife contacted the police, who arrested Marx and charged him with bigamy, fraud and making a false statement on his marriage license.

Marx, who appeared in court several weeks ago, faces up to six years in prison if convicted of fraud and three-and-a-half years if found guilty of bigamy. 

Ms Marx, a mother-of-three, met her long-haired husband at Outagamie County Fair in the late 1990s. At the time, he had two children of his own and was reportedly still married to his first wife.

But despite his marital status, Marx agreed to divorce his former partner for Ms Marx and after doing so in 2001, married his second wife a year later on Valentine's Day.

Following a courthouse wedding, the pair enjoyed a formal dinner, before taking a honeymoon in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

Marx then quit his job and moved in with his wife, who worked as a machine operator and used her income to support their combined families.

But just a year later, he reportedly vanished from the family home, leaving behind a note saying he could not handle his spouse's children.

'The first time he left me, it was like somebody reached into my chest and ripped my heart out of me,' Ms Marx said. 'He basically told me it was all my fault and he couldn't handle my kids.'

Several months later, Marx returned - just in time for his wife's Christmas bonus.

Despite her concerns, Ms Marx took him back and even spent $401,000 on a new home for them and their children in Clinton, Montana.

Over the next year, Marx started working for a timber-framing company and helped his wife's teenage son get into the business.

But he quickly began racking up debt with payday loans, according to Ms Marx, who also started to suspect her husband was cheating on her.

Following a heated argument, Marx suddenly packed his bags, loaded up his truck and left, without leaving a note or giving his wife a clear explanation for his departure.

For the following nine years, Ms Marx desperately searched for her husband while battling poor health and serious financial issues.

In 2012, she returned to New London to care for her father, before tracking down her husband's mother on Facebook and contacting her.

It was during her conversation with Marx's mother last month that she found out about her husband's new life - and his new wife, Marcie.

During the police investigation, Marx, who lives with Marcie Marx in Vernon County, allegedly told officers that he thought Ms Marx had taken care of their divorce while she was in Montana.

Found: It was during a conversation with Marx's mother last month that Ms Marx found out about her husband's new life - and his new wife, Marcie (seen with Marx). She described her discovery as 'shocking'

But Ms Marx told the newspaper: 'They said he told people it was his first marriage, and the (clerk) never checked vital statistics. I think people need to start doing their job.'

She added that she now intends to file for divorce - and will not date anyone until it is finalized.

'I consider myself married. I thought when you married someone, you married him for life, through sickness and health,' she said.
