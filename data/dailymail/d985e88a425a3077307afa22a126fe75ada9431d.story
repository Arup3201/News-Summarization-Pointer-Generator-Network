A mugger who dragged a pensioner to the ground and snatched her handbag picked the wrong judge to throw insults at when he was brought before a court.

Stephen Mann, 21, called Judge Andrew Hatton a ‘kn**head’ after being jailed for eight years for the cowardly attack on the 72-year-old and a knifepoint store robbery.

The no-nonsense judge ordered the serial criminal to be hauled back from the cells – and silenced him by adding another six months to his sentence.

Mann mugged the pensioner as she 
walked along the street with her husband in Wigan, Greater Manchester, 
last October, grabbing at her handbag as she walked past then dragging 
her to the ground and snatching it from her grasp.

The drifter then ran off, leaving his victim with injuries to her arm, shoulder and chest.

Just
 over a week later, Mann burst into R&W Gore newsagents in nearby 
Hindley and threatened the owner at knifepoint and demanded cash.

But
 the shopkeeper refused to hand over any money and told Mann to leave, 
throwing a wooden bat which hit him in the back as he fled.

Mann
 was caught later after being spotted riding a bike at a high speed, and
 after being pursued by officers including the force helicopter was 
cornered in a nearby park.

After being arrested he was seen rubbing his back and had injuries consistent with being struck by the shopkeeper.

At
 his trial at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted of two counts of 
robbery as well as a domestic burglary. Judge Hatton initially imposed 
sentences of seven years for the robberies – to run concurrently – plus a
 further 12 months on top for the burglary.

But
 as Mann was being led from the dock, he branded the judge a ‘kn**head’ 
and was brought back to answer for his contempt, receiving an extra six 
months – bringing  his total sentence to eight-and-a-half years.

Afterwards Detective Sergeant Nigel Rigby of Greater Manchester Police 
said: ‘Mann plagued the area, and would undoubtedly have continued had 
he not been caught.

‘He is a
 prolific offender and his reaction in the dock reflects the kind of 
person he is and his contempt for the law. I am pleased he will not pose
 a threat to our community for the foreseeable future.’

Judge Hatton, 49, has been a senior circuit judge since 2012, having been made a recorder in 2009.

Educated
 at £10,000-a-year Bolton School – whose Latin motto, Mutare Vel Timere 
Sperno, means ‘I scorn to change or to fear’, he went on to study at 
Leeds Polytechnic.

The 
married father-of-two lists his recreations as skiing, golf and theatre 
in Who’s Who, and has been part of the EU mission to Kosovo advising on 
cases of war crimes, terrorism and the illegal trade in human organs.
