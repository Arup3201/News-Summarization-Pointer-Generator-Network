Balanced high above the ground on a cherry picker, powerful hedge-cutter in his outstretched arms and dwarfed by a tree many times his size, this gardener looks like he’s got his work cut out.

But it’s a far from daunting task for David Swanton, head gardener at Powis Castle in Welshpool, mid Wales, for he and his team gather every year to give this magnificent 300-year-old, 46ft tall yew tree its yearly trim.

The job has been made much easier by the introduction of easily-manoeuvrable cherry pickers that have replaced the cumbersome and hard-to-move wooden ladders of old, meaning a job that used to take many months now takes mere weeks.

And when the team do get a chance to take a break, then the views from on high are certainly worth savouring.

The centrepiece of the National Trust tourist attraction is the magnificent castle that was originally built in 1200 as a medieval fortress.

But it’s often the magnificent gardens and greenery that draw the most gasps – vast hedges, magnificent borders that grow on a slope - giving the impression that they’re hanging in the air - and the enormous yew hedges that have grown to such an extent they've formed a tunnel that visitors can pass through.

Head for heights: David Swanton, head gardener at Powis Castle in Welshpool, mid Wales, at work on the yearly task of trimming the enormous yew trees

Bit of a trim: The work used to take many months to complete, with people having to scale heavy wooden ladders. Now modern cherry pickers, above, are used

Beautiful scene: The National Trust property in Powys near the Welsh/English border features extensive gardens, terraces and parkland

What a yew! A glimpse over the top of the tree offers views of carefully-tended lawns, well-kept borders and animals wandering in the castle's fields

Powis Castle, above, was originally built as a fortress in 1200 and was home to a succession of Welsh princes

Shear green: Two gardeners put the finishing touches to an area of the yew that they've worked on all morning

The task takes weeks to complete but appearances must be maintained for the thousands of tourists and gardening enthusiasts who visit each year

Vertical challenge: Some of the impressive shrubbery and gardens in the grounds are planted on steep slopes

Lift-off: The new cherry pickers help the workers to reach hard-to-get-at areas of the tree that were sometimes missed in the past

Tree way: The gigantic yew hedges have been around for 300 years and have grown to such an extent that a tunnel has been formed that visitors can walk through

The gardeners use ear-defenders to combat the noise of their hedge-cutters as they trim the foliage in the grounds of the National Trust property

Green giant: Elements of the trees have fused together over hundreds of years to form one enormous green growth

European influence: The gardens have been designed according to French and Italian styles

Neat and tidy: A great deal of work was carried out in the early twentieth century to restore the gardens after they had endured a period of neglect

Lady Violet, the wife of the fourth Earl of Powis, who was responsible for restoring the gardens, said they had the potential to be ‘the most beautiful in England and Wales’

This job's growing on me: The gardeners have become pruning experts thanks to their many hours spent tending the trees
