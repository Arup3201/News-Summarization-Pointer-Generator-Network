Australia's Attorney General George Brandis was left red faced after he got sunburnt at the G20 summit this weekend after forgetting to slip, slop, slap. 

Mr Brandis, who is one of the country's most high profile politicians, got a very red head as he waited for US President Barack Obama in the 40 degree heat at RAAF Base Amberley ahead of the meeting.

Social media users went into a frenzy tweeting about Mr Brandis' sunburn on Saturday.

He was branded 'Solar Panel Brandis' by one Twitter user who posted the pictures of the sunburn.

Twitter user @tim_rush posted: 'George Brandis' sunburn seems to get worse every time that shot is retweeted'. 

Another user @jonkudelka posted: 'George Brandis' sunburn just another example of the dangers of solar power'.  

Mr Brandis was one of the high ranking Australian officials that apparently snubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin, reported Channel 9.   

But when German Chancellor Angela Merkel's plane arrived on the tarmac five minutes a smiling Mr Brandis and Queensland Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney rushed out to meet her. 

Daily Mail Australia approached Mr Brandis' office for comment and they are yet to respond.

Mr Brandis is the 36th Attorney General and he has represented Queensland since May 2000. 

The news comes as new figures show Australian teenagers are turning their backs on sunbathing as the figures have dropped from 38 per cent compared to 60 per cent ten years ago. 

Professor Ian Olver, the Cancer Council's chief executive officer, said this figure had not shown 'significant' change since 2003-04, with the number of teenagers reporting getting sunburnt in 2013-14 dropping only one per cent compared to 10 years ago. 

He added that although two in three Australians would be diagnosed with skin cancer by age 70, adolescents underestimated their skin cancer risk, with one in two rating their chances of developing skin cancer as 'low'.

'It's wonderful to see teens understanding that a tan isn't the hallmark of health it was once made out to be,' he said.

'However, while most don't actively seek a tan, we do want them to actively protect themselves.

'Skin cancer doesn't have to be an inevitability. Take the recommended sun protection measures and the odds of preventing it are in your favour.'
