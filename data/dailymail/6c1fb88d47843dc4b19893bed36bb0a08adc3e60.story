Doctors say 16million Britons may not gain any benefit at all from taking a daily dose of Aspirin

Aspirin is pointless for a quarter of patients and hundreds could be needlessly dying as a result, doctors have warned.

They say that 16million Britons may not gain any benefit at all from taking a daily dose of the drug, which is mainly used  to thin the blood. 

Those at risk of heart attacks and strokes are also thought to be around four times more likely to suffer a fatal attack than those for whom aspirin is effective.

Scientists have now developed a  £10 urine test that can tell whether the drug is effective for individual patients.

Doctors want patients to be tested for aspirin resistance before they are prescribed the drug. 

Dr Paul Ames, a consultant at St George's Hospital, London, believes the new test could have a significant impact on the health of hundreds of thousands of patients.

He told The Daily Telegraph: 'Doctors need to realise that aspirin, the cornerstone of much cardiac therapy, is not working for up to 25 per cent of those taking it.

'Then there are the side effects, such as ulcers, to consider.' 

He added that aspirin-resistant patients are twice as likely to suffer a heart attack and almost four times more likely to suffer cardiovascular death.

He said it was imperative that there should be testing for aspirin resistance, so patients can be given alternative treatments.

Doctors have warned that a quarter of users are actually aspirin-resistant and should not take the medicine

Aspirin, known as acetylsalicylic acid, has been used for many years as a painkiller because it is an anti-inflammatory.

Low doses of up to 75mg are recommended for people with known cardiovascular disease because it thins the blood. 

Medics say that, in aspirin-resistant patients, blood thinning is poor. It means there a greater likelihood of clots forming in arteries, resulting in heart attacks and strokes.
