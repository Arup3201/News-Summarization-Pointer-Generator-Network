A £100million plan to redirect train services in Devon and Cornwall could be revived after huge waves washed the line away.

The government revealed said the army could be called in to help repair the track at Dawlish after huge waves demolished the sea wall on the south coast.

But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today announced he has ordered a ‘rigorous review’ into alternatives, after the last Labour government rejected the need to reroute the line.

Ministers have ordered an urgent review into alternative rail routes which could include reopening the South Railway or the Teign Valley lines which closed 50 years ago

Ferocious storms swept away sea walls and the rock on which the track lay, leaving nearby homes in danger

The incredible scene in Dawlish, Devon where a 50ft section of ground supporting a railway line has been completely washed away

MPs demanded to know why £50billion is being spent on the HS2 line linking London to the north of England while services in the south west are at the mercy of the weather.

The destruction of Dawlish's railway line has effectively cut off rail links to Cornwall, with a 200ft stretch of tracks left mangled and hanging over the boiling seas. 

On the seafront huge granite blocks had 
been ripped out by the force of the crashing waves and gales and 20 
homes had to be evacuated and people moved to a leisure centre.

Network Rail has warned the line, built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and popular for its stunning view, could be out of action for weeks.

Labour warned the closures are costing the area millions in lost revenue, with the West Country's crucial tourism industry threatened by the loss of a vital transport link.

Mr McLoughlin last night held urgent talks with Network Rail and MPs from Devon and Cornwall.

Network Rail said both tracks has been severely damaged by the sea, washing away ballast and the foundations on which the track is built

In 2006 the Met Office said one day it would be necessary to replace or move key transport links like the Dawlish line

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has offered the help of the Ministry of Defence to Network Rail to repair the line at Dawlish while Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hit out at the Environment Agency's attitude to local people

The Environment Agency faced fresh criticism today over its refusal to react to the demands of local people hit by the floods.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said questions would have to be asked about the ‘local accountability’ of quangos and the decision to stop dredging the rivers Tone and Parrett on the Somerset Levels.

And he condemned agency chief executive Lord Smith, for suggesting there had to be a choice between protecting rural or urban areas.

In the Commons today Mr Pickles hit back: ‘We will work to defend both town and country. For the record, and with respect, I have to say that I do not agree with the comments of Lord Smith, who implied that there was a choice between town and country.’

And raising the prospect of an overhaul of the Environment Agency’s powers, he added: ‘As the dark skies clear, there will be lessons to be learned, from the way in which we help local authorities to the role of quangos and the need for their local accountability, the influence of man-made policies on dredging, the effect of tree planting on our landscape and rivers, and the resilience of our nation as a whole throughout the 21st century.’

In the Commons today he revealed he has ordered a report into ‘the whole question of the resilience of the South West’.

He
 told MPs: ‘I am working with Network Rail to see that service is 
restored as quickly as possible but also to have a more rigorous review 
of some of the other alternatives which may be available.’

It raises the prospect of two lines closed half a century ago being reopened to carry trains away from the seafront.

In 2006 Labour ministers ruled out the idea of re-routing. Then-transport minister Derek Twigg said: 'Network Rail recognises the importance of the line and continues to devote considerable resources to maintaining it to an appropriate standard.

'It does not believe that the railway sea defences in Dawlish are likely to fail in the foreseeable future, thanks to the work carried out and the ongoing maintenance and monitoring.'

However at the time the Met Office said: ‘We are obviously going to have to think about one day replacing or moving key transport links like the Dawlish line.'

Now the dramatic destruction of the line means the idea is set to be revisited.

One option is to reopen a 15-mile stretch of the former Teign Valley line from Exeter to Newton Abbott which was closed in 1958, which would mean trains no longer stopped at Teignmouth or Dawlish.

Another more costly plan would be to revive the Southern Railway line which links Exeter to Plymouth via the northern edge of Dartmoor.

It would mean there would be no rail services to Dawlish, Teignmouth, Torbay, Totnes or Ivybridge and take trains on a new 50-mile route, adding to journey times.

Both options would be hugely expensive and controversial for those areas which would lose services.

But ministers faced cross-party calls in the Commons for radical action and investment to solve the problem.

Andrew George, Lib Dem MP for St Ives in the far south of Cornwall, said: If we are to put proper investment into a resilient service down to Penzance we need to make sure that there is a comparable funding in terms of the kind of money which is being spent on HS2 and other services.’

Former Labour Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw,  MP for Exeter, demanded to know what Mr McLoughlin is ‘doing to ensure this vital mainline into the South West is reopened as quickly as possible and what he is going to do in the long-term to help ensure that the vulnerability of the line at Dawlish is dealt with’.

Homes overlooking the Dawlish line have been left hanging after the land gave way

The fierce seas ripped a gaping hole in the coastal road, shattering tarmac and ripping holes in the the picturesque properties standing on the sea front, forcing residents to evacuate

The Government has found announced extra £30million to help councils deal with the damage caused by the severe weather outbreak.

The money for this year is on top of £100million announced by David Cameron yesterday.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said 42 new flood defence schemes are also planned for 2014-15, as he hailed the Government's £3.1 billion capital investment commitment as the largest by any government.

He told MPs: 'In the short-term, I can announce that the Government will provide an additional £130million for emergency repairs and maintenance, £30million in the current year and £100million next year.

'This will cover costs incurred during the current emergency response and recovery, as well as essential repairs to ensure that defences are maintained.'

However, Ukip leader Nigel Farage called for Britain’s foreign aid budget worth 
£11billion to be immediately suspended with the money diverted to 
help areas in the UK devastated by flooding.

The
 Ukip leader insisted ‘charity begins at home’ and urged the government 
to step up its response to the colossal damage to homes, businesses, 
roads and railways.

Mr McLoughlin insisted that he takes his responsibilities to Devon and Cornwall ‘incredibly seriously’.

‘I also would like certainly point out that over the next five years between 2014 and 2019 NR will be spending £38billion on the existing network.

‘There is not a shortage of understanding from this government as to the very important nature of rail services across the whole country.’

Anne Marie Morris, Tory MP  for the Newton Abbot seat which includes Dawlish, said the line ‘is a vital artery linking the South West to UK and a long term solution to coastal rail flooding must be found now’.

Devon County Council leader John Hart also demanded Government help for the South West following the latest storms.

He said: 'Once again we are cut off from the rest of the country by rail. Now following the storm damage at Dawlish, the rest of the peninsula is also cut off and we don't know when the line will be restored. The region deserves more help. We've been told we just had the wettest January in memory. But that followed the wettest January in memory last year.

'The time has come for the Government to take more action to make sure that Devon and Cornwall don't get cut off for weeks every winter. We need urgently to look at how our rail links can be better protected.’

Network Rail has called in a specialist concrete spraying machine to shore up the damaged section of seafront, with warnings the line could be out of action for up to six weeks.

Patrick Hallgate, head of the Western route, said: 'We absolutely understand the importance of the railway to the south west and will do everything we can to rebuild the railway at Dawlish as quickly and safely as we can.

'After a quieter night’s weather, we have been able to begin delivering machinery to our site compound with a view to protecting the exposed section of railway and the land behind it. We need to make sure we limit any further damage this weekend so that the significant repairs that are needed do not become greater still.

'We will continue working with the Government, Environment Agency, local authorities and other partners to explore ways of improving the railway’s resilience to extreme weather. The disruption to rail services in the south-west highlights the importance of that work and the need for all forms of transport to ensure that they are fit for the future.'

Labour;s shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Freak weather is rapidly becoming the new normal in our country, and I understand the difficulties you have in giving a timescale for the Dawlish repairs, given further bad weather is forecast for Saturday.

'But every week that this line is closed costs the regional economy tens of millions of pounds.'
