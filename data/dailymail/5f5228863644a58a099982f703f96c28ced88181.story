Three lucky punters are set to take home more than $16 million each after striking gold in Powerball's $50 million jackpot. 

Two of the multi-million dollar winning entries from Thursday night's jackpot, worth $16.67 million each, were purchased in Victoria and one in Western Australia.  

Of the two in Victoria, one bought their winning ticket online and another from an outlet in Rowville, south-east of Melbourne.

'Customers who purchased unregistered Powerball entries in Rowville are encouraged to check their tickets as soon as possible to discover if they’ve shared in the $50 million division one prize pool,' Tatts Lotteries said. 

'In Victoria, a Powerball player who purchased their entry in the Melbourne suburb of Rowville will wake up with the power to change it all thanks to Powerball! 

'Their winning ticket is not registered to a players card so they will not be able to be contacted directly with news of their new-found fortune.'

More than a million prizes were won across Australia in divisions two to seven, with those winners sharing in a prize pool of $27 million.

The winning numbers in the $50 million jackpot were 13, 9, 26, 18, 4 and 34, with Powerball number 3.
