By day he was an Amazon delivery driver, in his free time he transformed into a self-styled 'zombie hunter' who patrolled the streets in a decommissioned squad car.

Now he is accused of being a killer who murdered random women for thrills.

New details have emerged about the life of Bryan Miller who is accused of stabbing two Phoenix women to death in 1992. One of the women's body was found decapitated.    

Miller was an horror-obsessed fantasy enthusiast and a regular at events such as Comic Con and 'zombie walks' where he would indulge his alter ego. 

He was arrested in the cold-case killings of two women in1992 on Tuesday - and it has now emerged that he stabbed another women he met in 2002, but was let off when he claimed it was in self defense.  

Melissa Ruiz-Ramirez was out walking in Everett, Washington, on May 23 when she accepted a ride from a man whom she recognized from a friend's apartment complex. 

During the car ride, they talked about how some of the trails and pathways near that complex were dangerous, before Miller allegedly took Ruiz-Ramirez to his work and stabbed her in the back with a 12-inch serrated knife.

Alter ego: Bryan Miller would patrol the streets of Phoenix as the 'zombie hunter' 

Violent past: Bryan Patrick Miller, 42 - who was arrested Tuesday for a 22-year-old grisly double murder case and had a Facebook page calling himself 'The Arizona Zombie Killer' (pictured) - was acquitted of a separate stabbing in 2002, it has been revealed

Strange: Miller, a 'zombie hunter' and compulsive hoarder, was busted in connection with two horrific murders of young women that terrified the Phoenix area in 1992 and 1993

Arrested: Miller, a father-of-one, lists himself on Facebook as a driver for Amazon who loves zombies

However the charges against Miller were dropped after he argued that Ruiz-Ramirez had tried to rob him.

He moved back to Arizona shortly afterward and quietly resumed his life.

That is until his dramatic arrest on Tuesday.  

It has also been revealed that, in high school, Miller randomly stabbed a woman at a Phoenix mall but only served time until age 18, Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump said.

The Washington state case didn't require him to submit a DNA sample because he was exonerated.

Miller, who was reportedly obsessed with horror and fantasy, had a decommissioned police car he acquired in Washington and would drive around Pheonix calling himself 'The Arizona Zombie Hunter'.

He set up a Facebook page specifically for his hobby, which he described as: 'Keeping Arizona safe from the things that go bump in the night. Also available for your event.' 

DNA evidence recently collected by undercover officers now ties the divorced father to the slayings of Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas.

The women disappeared 11 months apart while riding their bikes through Phoenix. 

Miss Brosso was killed in November 1992 and her body was found shortly after she went missing.

Her decapitated head was found 11 days later in the Arizona Canal.

Bernas' body was discovered about 1 ½ miles away floating in the water in September 1993. 

Her turquoise bodysuit was discovered nearby. 

She had also been riding near the canal. 

Unsolved: Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas were murdered 11 months apart while riding their bike through Phoenix Arizona in the early 1990s. Police finally made an arrest this week

Scene: Phoenix Police Crime Response Unit members inspect the house of a Bryan Patrick Miller, the suspect of at least two 1992 murders of two young women in Arizona

New evidence: Police are expected to spend several days combing through Miller's home

Investigation: Miller's alleged victims had both disappeared riding bikes near the Amazon Canal in Phoenix

Social media: According to Miller's Facebook page he is a father of one, works as a driver for Amazon, likes Zombie films and conventions and recently embarked on a relationship

Investigators took six months to link the killings through forensic evidence and failed to make a breakthrough until Tuesday, when they Miller on two counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping and one count of sexual assault.

Police said they tied the case to Miller through DNA, but refused to say how they obtained the sample.

Police continued to comb through Miller's home near North Mountain Park on Thursday and are likely to be there for several days.

So far, there is no evidence that Miller knew either victim, Crump said. 

A bike was found in a shed in Miller's backyard, but Crump said it wasn't immediately clear if it belonged to either victim. 

Neither of the women's bikes - Brosso's purple, 21-speed Diamondback nor Bernas's green SPC Hardrock Sport - has ever been found, suggesting the killer may have kept them as trophies. 

Miller appeared in court Wednesday without an attorney.

According to police, he denied any involvement in the killings during a police interview. 

He acknowledged living in the vicinity at the time of the murders and that he rode his bike on the bike paths.

Jason Brosius, who worked with Miller at the time of his assault arrest in Everett, said he never saw Miller exhibit any strange behavior.

'He was kind of a quiet person but he wasn't anymore quiet than anybody else,' said Brosius, who still works at the same company, a provider of truck accessories. 'He didn't show any crazy, weird flags to me. He seemed pretty square.'

Brosius recalled how Miller moved right after his acquittal without saying much to anyone.

Crime scene investigators admit they were traumatized by the sheer brutality of the 1990s murders. 'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad

Shocking: The disappearance and then discovered of the two victims bodies frightened the area

Shocking: Angela Brosso, 22, was killed in November 1992 and her body was found shortly after she went missing. Her decapitated head was found 11 days later in the Arizona Canal

'He came back here, collected his personal stuff and that was the last anybody saw of him,' Brosius said. 'He said he was going back to Arizona, and that was it.'

Police said the killer probably had special military training due to the speed and brutality of the women's executions.

'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad said in 2012.

Phoenix police and the Cold Case Homicide Unit launched a fresh appeal for information that year, hoping someone who lived in the area may recall anything unusual among their neighbours.

'We're calling on the public who lived in that area at the time to think: 'Who had specialized training and might have seemed a little off?',' said Phoenix police Sgt Troy Hillman at the time.

It is not known whether Miller's arrest was made as a result of that inquiry. 

Zombie Hunter: Miller appears to have been obsessed with horror and fantasy and would attended fan conventions in a decommissioned police car, which he called 'The Arizona Zombie Hunter'

According to Miller's Facebook page he is a father of one, works as a driver for Amazon, likes Zombie films and conventions and recently embarked on a relationship.

A recent posting read: 'I have had to deal with some if the worst rejections you can imagine and some that were exceptionally cruel.. I am awkward when it comes to a lot of social aspects of my life'.

Another in October last year read: 'My birthday is on friday and normally I dread my birthday because of well 'reasons', but this year I have decided to celebrate my birthday the entire month of October. Seeing friends, concerts, food, car-related events, and just trying to enjoy things more, and this weekend I have the zombie walk and an extra day off and then next week is Halloween and Fearcon.'
