A 51-year-old American was stabbed to death with sharpened metal poles by a band after he refused to stop singing in a Thai bar.

Bobby Ray Carter Jr, from Dallas, Texas, had been on vacation in the popular Tourist region of Ao Nang in Krabi with his son, Adam, who was also stabbed in the attack.

Mr Carter, who has an 18-month-old daughter, had been enjoying a night out with his 27-year-old son in the Longhorn Saloon in the early hours of Wednesday, when a fight broke out.

Thai police have arrested three musicians, who are accused of stabbing the two tourists with sharpened rods outside the bar.

According to Phuket Wan Tourism News, the steel rods used in the fatal attack are a popular weapon with locals.

Lieutenant Colonel Jongrak Pimthong said that Mr Carter had started to sing with the band and refused to leave the stage, after having a few drinks.

On its website, the bar advertises 'jamming with the band' as one of its events and claims to be a friendly nightspot.

A Krabi tourist police officer told Fox News: '[Mr Carter] and his son quarelled with all three musicians because he wouldn't stop singing despite the musicians taking a break.'

'He then demanded the money he had already given as a tip back. But the real fight broke out outside of that pub. He was stabbed twice and died while on the way to local hospital,' Lieutenant Colonel Attapong Seanjaiwuth added.

Mr Carter's son, who runs the Chinese branch of their LED Cool Lights business, was stabbed in the arm during the attack and is recovering in hospital.

The alleged attackers have been named as Ratikorn Ramin, 27, Sathit Somsa, 40, and Noppanan Yoddecha, 26, according to the Phuket Wan News.

The fatal attack comes at a time of increased concern for the safety of tourists in that region of Thailand, as well as other popular tourist spots in the country.

In October last year, a 21-year-old Briton was stabbed and left for dead after he tried to save his girlfriend from an attempted gang rape.

Jack Cole and April Clifton, from Bath, were attacked by a gang on motorcycles as they walked along the beach in Ao Nang.

Miss Clifton was able to run to safety but Mr Cole was stabbed several times. He survived the attack but needed treatment for wounds to his face, chest, arms and legs.

A German woman had a thumb cut off in another attack, and a 19-year-old Dutch model was raped in Krabi last summer.
