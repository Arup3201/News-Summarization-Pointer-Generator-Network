With their talisman out injured and their captain suspended, Brazil are in for a tough ride in their semi-final.

They have been exciting to watch but mainly because they play off the cuff. Whereas Germany are a really solid team, Brazil sometimes play like a team of mavericks.

David Luiz
 offers genius or madness and little in between, Hulk can beat people 
but tends to smash the ball into the stands and Fred chugs along as if 
he’s running in sand. He’s hardly next in the line of brilliant 
Brazilian strikers and without Neymar, the pressure is on him more than 
ever.

I wonder 
if it could be Willian’s time. That No 10 role is there for the taking 
and he or Oscar have to grab the chance. But with the star man missing, 
this could be a game too far for Brazil.

Fearless Louis

Louis van 
Gaal showed tremendous courage to sub on Tim Krul. He is clearly a 
single-minded manager and thinks outside the box, but part of me was 
thinking it would be very interesting if it went wrong!

It would 
not have been a spontaneous decision. All week, he and Krul would have 
studied the Costa Ricans’ penalties and planned the substitution.

Krul was 
very hyped up before he came on and wanted to do everything he could to 
help his team. He won’t be winning the fair play award any time soon 
after his gamesmanship and it’s not what we like to see, but players are
 not there to be friends.

Arjen 
Robben doesn’t win friends with his dives but if the Dutch win the World
 Cup, they won’t care. I probably would have given Krul a few choice 
words but the whole episode was designed to psyche out the Costa Ricans 
and it worked.

Bring back 3-5-2

One of the
 most enjoyable things about this World Cup has been the number of  
different tactical systems on show. I love how teams have shown there is
 more than one way to play the game.

For a long
 time coaches have turned their noses up at the idea of 3-5-2 and made 
it unfashionable but it’s making a comeback with the Dutch. It can give 
you strength at the back and in midfield but still provide the option of
 playing two strikers.

Glenn 
Hoddle and Terry Venables both used it with England and maybe it’s 
something we can look at again because of our problems keeping the ball.
 Holland have proved it can be effective because if you’ve got the 
players, you can make any system work.

Man-mark Messi?

Argentina have been my tip for the World Cup from day one but I must say I’m not impressed with how they’re playing.

VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi

Lionel 
Messi is the best player I’ve seen in my lifetime and with goals and 
assists in Brazil it’s difficult to criticise him. But it still feels 
like we’re not getting the complete Messi package.

When he 
burst clear late on against Belgium, he had a couple of looks over his 
shoulder to see who was chasing him. The Messi of old would never do 
that. It’s like he still doesn’t trust his body to sprint properly.

The next 
tactical question for Van Gaal and Holland is whether to man-mark Messi 
or leave him. With Angel di Maria out, Holland could detail one man to 
take care of Messi. He’s an escape artist when he’s surrounded by 
players but lacks that explosive pace he once had.

Rodriguez my star

James 
Rodriguez has been my player of the tournament so far and not just 
because of his goals. I have loved watching him glide across the pitch —
 he lets the ball run across him so well and always has the bigger 
picture in his head.

Moment: Rodriguez's volley against Uruguay was one of the best goals of the tournament

Brazil kicked lumps out of him in the quarter-final but he kept coming back for more, always the sign of a good player.

He cost 
Monaco a lot of money so it’s no surprise to see him doing well but, 
playing in the French league, he’s not been as high-profile as some. I’d
 love to see him in the Premier League but I suspect Real Madrid will 
want him.
