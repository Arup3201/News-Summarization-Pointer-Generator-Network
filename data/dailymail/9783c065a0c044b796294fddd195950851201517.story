NATO issued a warning to the Kremlin last night that sending its tanks into Ukraine would mark a 'serious escalation' of the crisis.

Pro-Moscow separatists yesterday confirmed earlier claims by Kiev that at least three tanks and other armoured vehicles were in their hands.

The rebels refused to identify the origin but Ukraine alleged they were smuggled in from Russia.

It came as Kiev premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that Moscow is poised to cut off gas to his country in a bitter row over payments, calling for emergency measures in the event of a shut down.

Threatening: The arrival of the tanks - in separatist hands - caused shock waves since the deployment appeared to contract Russian assurances to the West that it was seeking to diffuse tension

'We have seen reports that Russian 
tanks and other armoured vehicles may have crossed the border into 
eastern Ukraine,' said NATO head Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

'If these reports are confirmed, this would mark a serious escalation of the crisis in eastern Ukraine.'

He
 called for Russia to continue to withdraw its troops massed in frontier
 zones and de-escalate a crisis which has claimed at least 270 lives.

A separatist source said: 'We confirm that we have the tanks. They will be sent to the most dangerous sectors.'

Kiev military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk claimed that two of the tanks had been 'destroyed' along with other military vehicles by Ukrainians forces, but this was disputed by separatists.

'They
 are in Donetsk and are the minimum that we have to defend the city," 
said rebel leader Denis Pushilin, alive despite two attempts on his life
 in recent days.

The claims 
of Russian firepower being smuggled across porous rebel controlled 
border posts in eastern Ukraine comes as the attention of Western 
leaders is diverted to the deepening turmoil in Iraq.

However,
 Ukrainian forces yesterday claimed a major victory in seizing back 
control of the strategic Azov Sea port of Mariupol after a fierce gun 
battle.

Russia did not immediately respond to the accusations but Reuters correspondents have reported seeing three tanks in the border town of Snizhnye in east Ukraine. Pictured is a Ukrainian tank during a battle with pro-Russian separatists at Slovyansk last week

Emergency measures: It came as Kiev premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that Moscow is poised to cut off gas to his country in a bitter row over payments, calling for emergency measures in the event of a shut down

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said an operation to dislodge separatists led by pro-Moscow Chechens had been successful, with the Ukrainian flag again flying in the city centre.

Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko 
told Putin by telephone that it was 'unacceptable' to smuggle tanks 
across the border while his premier ordered emergency plans to deal with
 a possible gas shutdown over a payments dispute.

Meanwhile,
 a tycoon yesterday (FRI) offered to help pay £80 million to erect a new
 1,200-mile Iron Curtain across Eastern Europe to keep Russia out of 
Ukraine.

The high-voltage 
electric fence is designed to stop Kremlin 'aggression', said Igor 
Kolomoiskiy, an oil, airline and banking tycoon who is also regional 
governor of Dnipropetrovsk.

The
 Ukrainian billionaire - who three months ago dubbed Vladimir Putin a 
"pint-sized schizophrenic" seeking to rebuild the Russian empire of the 
tsars - yesterday put the proposal to new Kiev president Petro 
Poroshenko for formal approval.

Victory convoy: About 100 soldiers emerged triumphant on Friday from the previously rebel-occupied buildings, shouting the name of their battalion, Azov, waving the Ukrainian flag and singing their national anthem

Happy: The soldiers punched the air in jubilation as they drove through their re-captured centre of Mariupol - the second largest city in the eastern Donetsk region

His
 real-life Iron Curtain would be topped by razor sharp barbed wire and 
surrounded by deep trenches to prevent tank invasions. It would be 
bolstered by remote control and anti-personnel mines.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops attacked pro-Russia 
separatists today in the southern port of Mariupol, apparently driving 
them out of buildings they had occupied in the center of the city.

Mariupol is the second-largest city in the eastern Donetsk region that has declared independence from the government in Kiev.

The key port sits along the main road leading from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in March from Ukraine.

Bullet-ridden: They also destroyed an armored vehicle and a heavy truck used by the separatists, leaving the vehicles scorched and riddled with large-caliber bullet holes

Taken truck: Witnesses said they saw troops capture at least four separatist fighters

About
 100 soldiers emerged triumphant on Friday from the previously 
rebel-occupied buildings, shouting the name of their battalion, Azov, 
and singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

They also destroyed an armored vehicle
 and a heavy truck used by the separatists, leaving the vehicles 
scorched and riddled with large-caliber bullet holes.

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said four government troops were wounded in what he called a successful operation.

Witnesses
 said they saw troops capture at least four separatist fighters. There 
was no immediate word of casualties on the rebel side, and Associated 
Press journalists at the site were blocked from entering the buildings.

Ukraine and the West have accused Moscow of fomenting the unrest in eastern Ukraine and supporting the separatist fighters.

Russia,
 however, has denied sending troops or weapons to Ukraine and has 
described the Russian citizens fighting with the separatists as 
volunteers.
