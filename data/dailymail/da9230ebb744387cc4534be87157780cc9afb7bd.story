A little boy found wandering the streets alone and knocking on doors in western Sydney at 4.15am has been reunited with his parents.

The boy was found knocking on doors in Regent Street in Fairfield at about 4.15am on Sunday.

The little boy, believed to be three or four years old, was wearing only a blue sweater and a nappy when found.

The toddler's long black hair initially had police thinking the child was a girl, but the mistake was realised and the boy's family were found nearly five hours after he was first discovered by neighbours.

'The exact circumstances of how he went missing are still not clear,' a NSW Police spokesman said, but no further police action is expected to be taken.

The boy had only made it a block away from his home.

Although the toddler could speak to police officers, they were not been able to identify him.

After more than four hours of canvassing the area, the officers found the parents, who were unaware that their son, when they knocked on their door on Olive Street at about 8.50am.
