Three sisters have been killed in a crash of multiple cars in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning.

Kay Ferril, 64, was driving her sisters Willie Morgagne, 66, and Rose Neal, 56, in her Hyundai up the I-95 when an Infiniti veered into the center median and ricocheted into them.

All three women who lived nearby were crushed and killed on impact and a third passenger - 66-year-old Barbara Thomas - was left in a critical condition at the scene near Rockledge.

A third car - a Toyota driven by George Cornejo - crashed into the Hyundai from behind, and a fourth driver was struck by the debris. Both suffered minor injuries, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Police said it is unclear why the Infiniti driver, Leonardo Alvarez-Savageau, apparently lost control and drove into the guardrail.

Alvarez-Savageau, who had two female passengers, suffered serious injuries.

Investigation: Police are investigating why an Infiniti veered into the center median, causing the crash

One passenger, Mary Vanassee, was left in a critical condition; the other, Shayla Davis, was in a serious condition.

Alcohol has been ruled out as a cause of the crash, the Sentinel reported.

An investigation is under way.
