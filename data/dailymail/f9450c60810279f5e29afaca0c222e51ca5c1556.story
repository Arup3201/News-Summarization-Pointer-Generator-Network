A golf instructor stabbed his ex-lover and their son to death just five days after he was freed by police following threats to kill them, an inquest heard yesterday.

Andrew Cairns, 44, told Rachael Slack, 38, he would murder her after she told him she was expecting a child by another man.

‘You have no idea what I’m capable of,’ he said, adding: ‘I will kill you and take him (the child) with me.’

Detectives arrested him but he was released while officers made further inquiries, the inquest jury was told.

The decision to free Cairns was made despite his having been known to psychiatric services for years.

He was bailed with conditions not to contact Miss Slack or their son Auden and a file assessing her as at high risk of homicide was sent by police to social services.

But five days later – on June 2, 2010 –  Cairns went to her home following a visit to the doctor for a headache. Screams were heard by a neighbour, who saw HR manager Miss Slack at a window with the ‘shadow of a man standing behind her’.

Police arrived to find three bodies in the sitting room. A pathologist said he believed Cairns killed Miss Slack and their son Auden.

Cairns was slumped on top of her with a knife lying between them. Auden, who was a month away from his second birthday, lay nearby.

A court heard the bodies of Miss Slack, Cairns, 44, and their son Auden, who was a month off his second birthday, were discovered downstairs at her village home

He had a faint pulse and was airlifted to the Royal Derby Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. His parents were pronounced dead at the scene.

On May 26, Cairns had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act after Miss Slack drove him to a police station because he refused to get out of her car.

The inquest heard he had threatened to kill her but an assessment found no evidence of mental illness and he was released on bail.

The next day, Miss Slack told police Cairns was loitering outside her house and he was arrested that evening after threatening again to kill her and their son.

Cairn was bailed with conditions not to contact Miss Slack or Auden and an assessment placed Rachael at a 'high risk of homicide'

He warned her: ‘If you are going to make it difficult, I will make it more so.’

Cairns was interviewed the following day, on May 28, but gave a different version of events and  was released again. He warned his GP at the end of his consultation on June 2 that it would prove to be ‘the most important day of your career’.

Cairns was then caught on CCTV catching a bus straight to Miss Slack’s home at Holbrook, Derbyshire.

The murders took place shortly afterwards and Guy Rutty, a forensic pathologist who attended the scene, said Miss Slack suffered 32 injuries. She died from multiple stab wounds to the chest including two to her heart.

Auden suffered 16 injuries, including four stab wounds to the back and five to the chest.Cairns, who was on antidepressants, also died from multiple stab wounds to the chest.

Professor Rutty said the case was similar to others he had worked on in which a man murders members of his family and positions himself beside or on them as a ‘last act ... to be with the person’.

He said that on the balance of probabilities he favoured the scenario that Cairns ‘was responsible (for the deaths of) the other two’.

Miss Slack’s boyfriend at the time of the deaths, Robert Barlow, 41, attended the hearing and is due to give evidence today.

The inquest, which heard that Miss Slack was 14 to 15 weeks  pregnant when she died, continues at Derby coroner’s court with an  11-strong jury.
