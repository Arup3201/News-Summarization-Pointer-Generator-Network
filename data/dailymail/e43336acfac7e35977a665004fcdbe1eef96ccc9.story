Rock star Bruce Dickinson has revealed he is battling cancer.

The 56-year-old Iron Maiden singer has had treatment for a tumour on his tongue, the band’s website says.

The cancer was diagnosed during a routine check-up just before Christmas and Dickinson has just completed a seven-week course of chemotherapy and radiology.

The band are due to go on a European tour from May 27 to July 5, but have urged fans to be patient. 

Hundreds of upset Iron Maiden fans from around the world took to Twitter to wish him a speedy recovery. 

The band said in the statement: 'Just before Christmas, Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson visited his doctor for a routine check-up. 

'This led to tests and biopsies which revealed a small cancerous tumour at the back of his tongue. A seven week course of chemotherapy and radiology treatment was completed yesterday.

'As the tumour was caught in the early stages, the prognosis thankfully is extremely good. Bruce's medical team fully expect him to make a complete recovery with the all clear envisaged by late May. It will then take a further few months for Bruce to get back to full fitness.

'In the meantime we would ask for your patience, understanding and respect for Bruce and his family's privacy until we update everyone by the end of May. Bruce is doing very well considering the circumstances and the whole team are very positive.' 

The metal band finished a three-year world tour in July 2014 with a headline slot at the Sonisphere Festival

Dickinson - who quit the band in 1993 only to re-join in 1999 - is known and loved for his on-stage energy and wide vocal range. 

Last year he said he had boycotted Glastonbury for being too bourgeois. 

'Personally I have no interest in going to Glastonbury,' he said. 'In the days when Glasto was an alternative festival it was quite interesting, but anywhere Gwyneth Paltrow goes and you can live in an air-conditioned yurt is not for me.'

In September, the trained pilot took part in a mock fight above the grounds of Knebworth House to commemorate the start of World War One.

Dickinson flew one of the planes in the display, which lasted for 15 minutes and ended with the Band and Bugles of The Rifles playing the Last Post just before Deftone's set on the main stage.

Iron Maiden were formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 and have sold 80 million albums and won multiple awards, making them one of the most successful heavy metal bands of all time.
