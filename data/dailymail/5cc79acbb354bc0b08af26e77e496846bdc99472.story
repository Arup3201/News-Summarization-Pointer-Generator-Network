A parasitic worm may hold the key to keeping skin grafts and plasters firmly in place over wounds, according to a new study.

Researchers at Boston’s Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) have created a microneedle inspired by Pomphorhynchus laevis, a spiny-headed worm that lives in the intestines of its hosts.

The worm securely attaches to the host's intestinal wall by piercing it and then expanding its cactus-like head into the intestinal tissue.

The Karp lab invented this flexible microneedle adhesive patch that can stick to soft tissue

The graft contains microneedles with swelling tips.

When they pierce the skin, the tips swell -  holding the graft in place.

The swelling is reversible so the graft can be easily removed when the wound has healed.

The microneedles are three times stronger than the stitches and staples currently used and are less prone to infection.

‘Dr Jeffrey Karp and his collaborators continue to look to nature to find new ways to solve real problems in medicine,’ said Dr Scott Somers.

‘Drawing on how parasitic worms attach to and feed on fish, they have designed a way to close surgical wounds that appears better than anything currently available for clinical use.’        

Inspired by the worm's swelling mechanism, Dr Karp and his team created a sticky patch that can interlock with tissue by using microneedle tips that swell. 

The tips expand using a water-based mechanism that is both quick and reversible.

‘The adhesion strength of the tips of the microneedle is more than three times stronger than conventional surgical staples used for skin graft fixation,’ said Dr Seung Yun Yang, a BWH research fellow.

Each cone-shaped needle is made of a stiff plastic non-swelling core, and a tip that is rigid in its dry state, but swells upon contact with water.

‘The unique design allows the needles to stick to soft tissues with minimal damage to the tissues.

‘Moreover, when it comes time to remove the adhesive, compared to staples, there is less trauma inflicted to the tissue, blood and nerves, as well as a reduced risk of infection,’ said Dr Karp.

The invention may one day be an alternative to the trauma and infection-prone staples and sutures that are currently used in the operating theatre.

How the needle tips swell to hold skin grafts in place over a wound

Bohdan Pomahac, MD, director of both 
BWH Plastic Surgery Transplantation and the BWH Burn Centre, said: ‘I 
envision that this device will be very effective in treating patients, 
both by skin graft fixation, but also by delivery of active substances 
into the surface of the wound.

‘These substances may be for example, antibiotics, growth-promoting compounds, or anti-inflammatory molecules.

‘It's
been a pleasure to collaborate with Dr Karp, who is a visionary in 
science, to help provide the link to the microneedle adhesive's clinical
applicability.’
