Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has called the Chelsea supporters caught singing racist songs on camera 'a few idiots' who do not represent the club.

The Dutchman, who earned a hero's reputation at Chelsea for scoring 87 goals in 177 games, insisted he never experienced any such discrimination while at Stamford Bridge.

A video has emerged of Chelsea supporters chanting the N-word and making anti-Semitic slurs on a London to Manchester train last Sunday following the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur.

Last month a group of Chelsea fans were filmed refusing to allow a black man from getting on a carriage on the Paris Metro before the Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain. 'We're racist, and that's the way we like it,' the group could be heard singing.

Hasselbaink, the manager of Burton Albion, flying high in League Two, does not recognise these incidents as an aspect of the club he loves.

'I know lots of Chelsea supporters and I've never experienced that,' he said. 'I don't think Chelsea is about that.

'I think the boys that have done it are a few idiots. And that's it. They are not even a percentage of Chelsea fans. They do not represent Chelsea.'
