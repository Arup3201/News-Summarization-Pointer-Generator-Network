Jennifer Bricker, 27, currently works as an aerialist and motivational speaker, but she hopes that adding dancing to her list of talents will take her career in new directions.

She said: 'People always talk about Jen overcoming this, and overcoming that, and I thought this is a true challenge, this is something to truly overcome.'

Jennifer - known as Jen - said that dance was something she was never sure she would be be able to do but now she is working with a professional dancer to choreograph a routine that incorporates her impressive aerialist skills.

'My real dream would be to perform on a show like Dancing With The Stars,' she added.

Jen's incredible story began when she was adopted after being abandoned at birth by her biological parents who didn't feel they could cope with her disability.

She was raised in the small town of Oblong, Illinois, by adoptive parents Sharon and Gerald Bricker and three older brothers. 

Jen has already enjoyed an incredible career. She insists that 'can't' is a word that is not in her vocaulary

Jen who now lives in Studio City, California, says she was always taught to believe she could do anything, and she grew up to excel in a range of sports, including basketball, softball and volleyball.

But the young Jen's greatest love was always gymnastics, and it wasn't long before she was competing in - and winning - competitions at state level.

Growing up, the young gymnast idolised American Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu - and her story took another unbelievable twist when it turned out Moceanu was in fact her long-lost sister. 

Jen said: 'Some of my earliest memories are of watching gymnastics on TV when I was six years old and trying to imitate the moves.

'Dominique was my favourite gymnast. I wouldn't shut up about her - even at the age of six I fantasised about being related to her.

'When I was 16 I discovered Dominique was actually my sister and I remember thinking these kind of things happen in the movies, this is not real life.'

During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, USA, Jen was transfixed as Dominique became an overnight sensation.

She said: 'All I knew of my heritage was that I was Romanian and Dominique was also Romanian. We have the same features and spunky personalities. I was just drawn to her.'

Inspired, entered gymnastics and tumbling competitions and found she had a natural ability.

Jen says out her idol was her long-lost biological sister was just the beginning of an amazing journey

She competed in the Junior Olympics and even won a State Championship in tumbling competing against able-bodied people.

However, in her teens she began to wonder about her birth family and right before her sixteenth birthday she asked Sharon for more information.

Jen said: 'I wasn't expecting her to say yes because we've always been very open in our family but to my surprise she pulled out a folder of papers.

'She handed a document and said, 'You're never going to believe this, but your biological last name is Moceanu.'

'As soon as the words left her lips, I knew what it meant; my childhood idol was my sister.'

It was four years before Jen wrote to Dominique to introduce herself and see whether her biological family knew of her existence.

Jen said: 'Just before Christmas, 2007, when I was 21, I opened up a letter and I saw a card fall out and it was from Dominique.

'I saw her signature and it was just the most amazing feeling. Half way through the letter she said I was about to be an auntie, so I knew that they had accepted me immediately.

'Four months later I met Dominique and my younger sister, Christina.

Jen says that she fells happiest when she is performing acrobatic feats and hanging from silk threads

'The similarities were so apparent it was shocking; we sounded alike, our mannerisms were the same and with Christina, especially, it was like looking in the mirror.

'All three of us did gymnastics and Christina loved volleyball, which is my second favourite sport.

'Since then we've become close and I feel like a piece of the jigsaw of my life has fallen into place.'

Now Jen works as an acrobat, aerialist and motivational speaker and has even toured with Britney Spears, performing acrobat routines.

She said: 'Although people I've just met are always amazed by what I can do, outside of work my friends say they forget that I'm any different.
