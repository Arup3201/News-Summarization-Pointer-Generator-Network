CLICK HERE to read the match report from PSG's 5-0 thumping of St Etienne that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic score a  hat-trick

Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba was spotted in the stands during Paris Saint-Germain's 5-0 victory over St Etienne in Paris on Sunday evening.

With the transfer window closing on Monday, many would be mistaken into suspecting that the France international was on the verge of leaving Italy for the big-spending Ligue 1 club.

But, Juventus supporters can rest assured that the 21-year-old was merely attending the game to support his older brother Florentin who plays for St Etienne.

The Pogba family would have left disappointed after St Etienne were thumped 5-0 by the champions - with PSG talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring a hat-trick on his return from injury while Edinson Cavani and a comical own goal from keeper Stéphane Ruffier completed the rout.

Pogba was courted by several Premier League teams during the close season with rumours of a return to his former club Manchester United - while Chelsea were reportedly willing to pay £60 million for the all action midfielder.

However, reports from Italy claim that the player is close to signing a new £76,000-per-week contract that will keep him in the company of the Old Lady until 2019.

Discussing Pogba's future at the club, Juventus CEO Beppe Marotta claimed: 'Pogba? We have had some negotiation with his agents, we hope to arrive at a positive conclusion shortly.'
