QPR midfielder Alejandro Faurlin has signed a contract extension as the club prepares to return to the Barclays Premier League.

The 27-year-old Argentinian, Rangers' longest-serving player, has agreed a one-year extension which will keep him at Loftus Road until next summer.

Faurlin 
told the club's official website, www.qpr.co.uk: 'It's nice to sign the 
new deal. It took a little bit of time, but I am so happy everything is 
now sorted.

'It's been quite an amazing journey so far - relegation, promotions and plenty more - but it's been a beautiful experience. I hope the next chapter is the most epic yet.'

Faurlin joined QPR from Institute FC in July 2009 and has made 130 appearances to date, scoring five goals.

However, he missed the second half of last season and the club's successful promotion drive with a cruciate ligament injury, and is raring to go after returning to fitness.

High praise: Joey Barton says Faurlin is one of the best midfielders he has played with

He said: 'I was disappointed to miss the second half of last season due to injury, but I'm feeling great now and looking forward to returning to pre-season training next week.

'The Premier League is where every player wants to play and I am no different.

'We all know that the Premier League will be very difficult, with so many great teams, but we are looking forward to the challenge ahead.'
