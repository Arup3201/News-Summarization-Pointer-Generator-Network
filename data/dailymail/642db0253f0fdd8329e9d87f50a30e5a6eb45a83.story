Kyle Van WinkleJust a normal guy: Kyle Van Winkle, 30, has been identified as the man who died in a parking lot outside Arrowhead Stadium

The man who died Sunday after a fight over him breaking into a car in a parking lot at the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium is the son of a police sergeant.

Kyle Van Winkle, 30, died after a fight with the man who owned the jeep he broke into in the parking lot of the stadium after a Chiefs game. It has been revealed that he is the son of a police officer.

Mr Van Winkle's family has declined to speak to the media other than to say 'he was a good man.'

Mr Van Winkle's father is Dean Van Winkle, a sergeant with the Grandview (MO) Police Department, according to the Kansas City Star.

Dean Van Winkle, who also doubles as the department's public information officer, emailed the paper the following statement.

'So much of what I am seeing makes my son look to be the one to blame,' he wrote. 'Those that know my son know he is not a thief and how good a man he is. Not much else can be said.'

MailOnline can further reveal that Kyle Van Winkle was a loan operations specialist with a local credit union.

A neighbor who spoke to the Star also spoke well of Mr Van Winkle.

'He usually goes out of his way to help his friends out and doesn’t cause trouble,' Michael Doerr told the paper.

The mysteriously dead man played varsity sports in both high school and college and had no history to suggest Sunday's behavior was coming. By all accounts, Kyle Van Winkle was a normal guy.

A man who spent Sunday night in police custody in connect with the death of a man in the parking lot at the Kansas City Chief's Arrowhead Stadium is expected to be released later today

An unidentified suspect and three good samaritans got into a fight with Mr Van Horn after he was found going through a man's things inside his vehicle in the stadium's parking lot.

He was soon found by emergency personnel lying unconscious on the pavement. Paramedics began administering first aid before he was transported to a hospital, where he died.

The father was one of three people taken into custody by police on Sunday, who also interviewed other witnesses. He is expected to be released from custody. 

On Monday police said that they expect to 
release the three whom they described as ‘persons of interest’ in
their investigation into the man’s suspicious death. 

Officers are also searching a 
suburban Kansas City home, believed to belong to one of the persons of interest, in connection with the death.

Police spokesman Darin Snapp said that detectives had received information that evidence related to the
man's death is at the home in Independence.

Medical authorities told investigators on Sunday evening they could detect 'no obvious signs of what caused (the man’s) death.'

'Talking to several witnesses that 
were out here in the parking lots, there was an individual who came back
to his vehicle, saw someone inside the vehicle that did not belong,' said Snap.

'A struggle ensued between the two. That's when the individual (who had been inside the vehicle) collapsed.'

Investigating: Kansas City police Officer Darrin Snapp said an autopsy will be key since the man wasn't stabbed or shot

Snapp said there were no obvious indications of how the death occurred. He had not been shot or shot, and hospital officials didn't find signs of a significant struggle on his body.

'We
don't know if the person had a health condition, had a heart attack. We
don't know,' Snapp said.

'We're going to investigate this as a homicide
until we hear differently. Right now it's a suspicious death but we are
going to investigate it as a homicide.'

Officers said the fight did not appear to be related to fan rivalry.

Chiefs
spokesman Ted Crews said the team is aware of the incident but cannot 
comment further because of the police investigation.

Flashing
lights from ambulances and police cars were visible across the 
Arrowhead Stadium parking lot as cars tried to leave after the game.

The game began about 3.30pm and the Chiefs lost to the Denver Broncos.

The
death came one year to the day after Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher 
shot and killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, at a 
home not far from the stadium

Belcher then drove to the team's practice
facility and fatally shot himself in front of then-coach Romeo Crennel 
and general manager Scott Pioli.
