A 21-year-old has told how he was left paralysed after suffering a simple bout of tonsillitis.

Jack Kelly, from Coventry, developed a rare nerve disease, called Miller Fisher syndrome, which was triggered by the tonsillitis.

It left him with blurred vision, unable to walk and confined to the stroke unit of his local hospital.

Jack Kelly, 21, from Coventry, was paralysed and unable to see for more than a week after a bout of tonsillitis triggered a rare nerve disease called Miller Fisher syndrome

Now, the Fitness First employee has recovered and is competing in gruelling Tough Guy competitions.

Mr Kelly told MailOnline: ‘It’s given me a real appreciation for life. You never know what is around the corner and what will happen.

‘While it was a horrible experience, I was lucky in a way as I now know how much I have.’

Mr Kelly was 18-years-old and a student at the University of Plymouth when he fell ill.

A week after recovering from tonsillitis he returned from the gym and noticed he was struggling to walk normally up a flight of stairs.

He dismissed the problem assuming it was a result of his muscles being tired from his workout.

Mr Kelly spent a week in Derriford Hospital's stroke unit (pictured) after developing double vision, poor muscle coordination and weakness. Doctors were so worried they offered him a visit from the hospital's pastor

Mr Kelly had intensive physiotherapy to help him walk again and has made such a good recovery that he is now taking part in Tough Guy challenges (pictured) which involve completing long assault courses

However, as the day progressed his legs became progressively weaker and he began to suffer double vision.

Mr Kelly had previously suffered from migraines so thought he might be getting another one.

He hoped he would be able to sleep it off and so went to bed.

During the night, he got much worse and when he tried to get out of bed in the morning he collapsed.

He had to be carried to an emergency GP appointment by his housemates and the doctor immediately sent him to Derriford Hospital where he was admitted and diagnosed with Miller Fisher syndrome.

Mr Kelly said: 'It's given me a real appreciation for life. You never know what is around the corner and what will happen. While it was a horrible experience, I was lucky in a way as I now know how much I have'

During his illness, Mr Kelly was dependent upon a wheelchair as his legs were to weak to support him. He says the experience was awful as he had no idea what was happening to his body

He said: ‘You never think about getting out of bed in the morning – you just take for granted that your feet will take your weight – so it was a shock not to be able to do that.

‘I was in a total panic – I had no idea what was happening.’

He added: ‘I was worried about my mum and dad – I didn’t know what to say to them. They were worried sick.’

Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare, acquired nerve disease that is a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

It causes abnormal muscle coordination and paralysis of the eye muscles. It can also cause general muscle weakness and breathing problems.

Mr Kelly (left, with his mother, Linda, and friend, Luke) said while he was ill he was concerned about his parents because they were 'worried sick' about his health

Mr Kelly said he decided to take part in the Tough Guy competitions as he wanted to prove he had fully recovered and that he didn't need 'nannying'. He says after his illness he had been 'wrapped in cotton wool'

Symptoms often develop after a viral illness and most patients start to recover within two to four weeks.

Mr Kelly’s condition continued to deteriorate while he was in hospital and he says that at one point the hospital staff asked him if he would like a visit from the pastor.

He said: ‘I had no idea what was going on – I didn’t know how bad it was going to get.

‘When they offered a visit from the pastor, that was the worst.’

Mr Kelly spent a week in the stroke unit during which time he received intensive physiotherapy in an attempt to help him walk again.

He said: ‘I was easily the youngest person in the stroke unit – it’s not a pleasant place.

Mr Kelly said: 'I am very lucky. Many people who have the ability to walk, or to see, taken away don't get it back. I appreciate things so much more now - you don't realise how lucky you are until these things are taken away'

‘A lot of the people there were much worse than me – that kept me going as I could see that my situation could be much worse.’

After a week and a half in hospital, Mr Kelly was able to walk again with support and he was released from hospital to continue his recovery at home.

He said: ‘I am very, very lucky. Many people who have the ability to walk, or to see properly, taken away don’t get it back.

‘I appreciate things so much more now – you don’t realise how lucky you are until these things are taken away.’

Mr Kelly will take part in his next Tough Guy competition in January and he will be raising money for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital

Since his recovery, Mr Kelly has taken part in Tough Guy competitions which involve completing long assault courses which are littered with obstacles such as fire, electric cables, barbed wire and half-flooded tunnels.

He said: ‘I was wrapped in cotton wool after being in hospital so I wanted to prove that I had come through it.

‘I wanted to prove to everyone that I didn’t need nannying – my parents told me not to do it but I decided to give it a go anyway.’

Mr Kelly will take part in his next Tough Guy event on January 26 to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare, acquired nerve disease that is a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

The condition is characterised by abnormal muscle coordination and paralysis of the eye muscles.

Symptoms often develop after a viral illness and can also include general muscle weakness and breathing difficulties.

Most people with the condition recover well and recovery normally begins within two to four weeks of the onset of symptoms.

Some people are left with some degree of disability and about three per cent of patients suffer a relapse.
