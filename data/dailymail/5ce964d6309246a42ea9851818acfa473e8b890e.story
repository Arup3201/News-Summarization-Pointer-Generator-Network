In her heyday she was the world's most graceful and stylish ocean liner, boasting four U.S. presidents and glamorous Hollywood stars on her passenger roll.

She sailed the Atlantic in record time, offering her passengers a trip in the lap of luxury.

But by the late 1960s, the SS United States - dubbed America's Flagship - was resigned to retirement, and consigned to a pier on the Delaware River in Philidelphia.

Heyday: Dubbed America's flagship the SS United States, was the most luxurious and opulent ocean liner of its time. It still holds the record for fastest trans-Atlantic crossing despite having been retired from the high seas 17 years ago

Campaign: A not-for-profit group, backed by best-selling author David Macaulay, have launched a campaign to restore the passenger liner to its former glory. The ship has been docked on the Delaware River in Philadelphia and left to rust since she retired in 1969

Four former U.S. presidents feature on the passenger log of America's Flagship, the SS United States - Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Bill all sailed aboard the ocean liner.

Famous passengers includes Marlon Brando, Coco Chanel, Sean Connery, Walt Disney, Judy Garland, Cary Grant, Charles Heston, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, John Wayne and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, sailed on the ship.

Another famous passenger, of sorts, was the Mona Lisa, Leonardo's masterpiece, which in 1963, travelled to the U.S. for special exhibitions in Washington and New York.

With the rise in the popularity of flying, prices fell and gone was the decadent era of glitz and glamour on the high seas.

But today a new campaign has been launched by U.S. best-selling author and illustrator David Macaulay, to save the once-majestic ocean liner left to rust for the last 17 years.

'It's a unique object, a symbol of time in American history that we've sort of long since passed,' Macaulay said. 'It's important to keep it intact visually.'

The author, who crossed the Altantic on board the impressive liner with his family to start a new life in American in 1957, said he is keen to 'draw attention to it' in anyway he can.

He is working on a new book, which will trace the evolution of passenger ships through to the building of the SS United States, as well as describe his experience as a boy sailing on the ship to his new home on a new continent.

The steam-powered ship, which measures almost 1,000ft, with its giant twin chimneys painted red, white and blue, was launched in 1952.

It still holds the record for the fastest trans-Atlantic voyage by a passenger ship and is the largest ocean liner to be built in the U.S.

She is 10ft longer than the Titanic and nearly 10,000 tons heavier, it carried one million passengers, before the ship was retired in 1969.

In 2010 the not-for-profit organisation SS United States Conservancy bought the retired liner for $5.8million, donated by Philadelphia philanthropist H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest.

The money also covered maintenance and preservation costs.

The group hopes to raise enough money to restore the ship's exterior and convert the interior, which covers around 500,000 square feet.

The vision is to create space inside for restaurants, shops, as well as a museum and education centre.

Susan Gibbs, the granddaughter of the ship's designer William Francis Gibbs, and director of the conservancy group, said they are hoping to find a permanent berth for the renovated vessel on the country's east coast.

She said New York is currently the leading candidate and added that the refurbishment of the ship's exterior alone, is expected to cost a staggering $40million to $60million.

Macaulay added: 'It's battered. It's beaten, but it's all paint so it's superficial.'

The SS United States is 990 feet long.

If the ship stood on her end, she would rise nearly as high as New York's Chrysler Building.It was more than 100 feet longer than the Titanic.

Designer William Francis Gibbs wanted the ship to be fireproof, so insisted no wood was used in her construction. The only exception was the ship's grand pianos, which were made from a fire-resistant mahogany.

Fastest passenger liner: The SS United States still retains the title fastest passenger liner after crossing the Atlantic in record time on its maiden voyage in 1952

More aluminium was used building the SS United States than any other ship previously. The idea was to reduce the ship's weight and make her the fastest ocean liner.

The ship was designed to be just wide enough (101 feet) to pass through the locks of the Panama Canal.

The design was so innovative at the time that details of the construction were kept top-secret.

It was the first passenger liner to be built almost entirley in a dry dock, out of the view of the public.

Five days before her maiden voyage in July 1952, the SS United States was opened to the public at her berth in New york.

A crowd of 70,000 turned out to see the new ship.

Restoration: The SS United States Conservancy Group, led by Susan Gibbs, granddaughter of William Francis Gibbs - the ship's designer - said restoring the exterior alone is expected to cost up to $60million

The ship reached speeds of 44 miles per hour, during testing. She could reverse almost as fast as the Titanic could go forwards.

On her maiden voyage she was the first American ship in 100 years to capture the coveted Blue Riband - which is awarded to the fastest trans-Atlantic ocean liners. She still holds the record, 60 years later.

The SS United States was built to be converted in war time. It could carry 15,000 troops, 10,000 miles without the need to refuel.

For her maiden voyage the ship's catering team stocked 7,935 quarts of ice cream and 500lbs of caviar. The ship's galley could make 9,000 meals every day.

The ship was retired from service in 1969. She has spent her retirement docked on the Delaware River in Philidelphia. She has been there for 17 years.
