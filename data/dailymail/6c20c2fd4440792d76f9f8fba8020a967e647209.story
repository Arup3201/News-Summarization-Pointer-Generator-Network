Brothers Tryon, 19, and Tyshaune Kincade, 18, were formally charged Monday in the shooting death of Sergent First Class Jim Vester, 32, after arranging to sell the 12-year military veteran an iPad on Wednesday.

According to phone records released by the police, the Indianapolis father wanted to buy an iPad from the brothers as a Christmas present for his parents based off of their Craigslist ad.

At 3:05pm, Vester texted: 'Can I get your address'. At 3:14pm, the suspects texted him to meet at 920 Wyckford Dr.

Vester
 arrived at the address at 3:49pm  and texted: 'are you here?' and the 
suspect quickly replied 'yes'. Five minutes later Vester was killed.

Police were able to catch the brothers that evening after tracing phone records and interviewing witnesses. They arrested 18-year-old Tyshaune Kincade after pulling him over in a traffic stop.

Target: Phone records show that the last text message Vester received from the brothers was at 3:49 and he was killed five minutes later

After searching Tyshaune's mother's house ,they were able to figure out that the text messages sent to Vester's phone came from 19-year-old Tryon Kincade's phone.

Tryon's number was also the same one used in other robberies in the area.

The brothers' next hearing is set for Tuesday.

One of their Facebook pages boasts of going to the school of 'da thug life'.

Vester left behind his one-year-old son Gavin and wife Jamie.

In the wake of the senseless murder, nearly 1,500 people have donated $58,000 to a YouCaring.com fundraiser set up by Vester's family for the man described as a 'great cook, loving father and faithful man.'

'He would drop everything and cross town to help you and your family,' friend Master Sgt. Jerry Wurm said.

Vester was a career military man, 
with 12 years of service in the Indiana National Guard, including a 
year-long tour of duty in Iraq in 2006.

'I
 was (always) telling young soldiers that never had Jim’s food, I said, 
‘Hey if Jim’s cooking, you better show up because it’s good and you 
won’t be disappointed,’ Wurm said.

His distraught family said that 
Vester had recently started a new job as a military mechanic and 
expressed their shock over his death.

'He
 knew it wasn’t the best neighborhood, that’s why he went in the middle 
of the afternoon,' said family friend Sarah Hill. 'He was being 
careful.'

Devastated: Wife, Jamie, (pictured with Jim and son Gavin), said: 'I am so happy his story has (gone) viral so maybe people will think twice about trying to run a scam/robbery/murder through Craigslist or any other site'

Death: Jim was an Iraq veteran and his family are devastated by the death of the popular National Guard serviceman

Kincade was taken into custody by 
police at around 7 pm after a traffic stop at the 7500 block of 
Pendleton Pike according to Indianapolis police.

'He wanted to be a good husband and father his entire life,' Hill said to the Indianapolis Star.

'Jim is one of those guys who is just a really genuinely good guy who loved being a dad.'

Vester
 graduated from Yorktown High School in Delaware County in 2000 and was a
 sergeant first class in the Indiana Army National Guard, serving a 
one-year tour in Iraq starting in June 2005.

'During
 this time, he proved himself to be one of the most proficient and 
reliable mechanics in the automotive section,' the Indiana Army National
 Guard said in a statement.
