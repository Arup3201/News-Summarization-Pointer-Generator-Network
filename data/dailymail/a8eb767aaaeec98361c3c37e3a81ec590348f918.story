An attorney for the family of the 
teenager found dead inside a rolled up wrestling mat today claimed an 
expert analysis suggests the released CCTV footage was doctored to blur a
 figure walking near the corpse.

Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in the gym at Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia in January.

Investigators from local and state 
law enforcement agencies determined Johnson suffocated after attempting 
to recover a shoe at the bottom of a wrestling mat.

New footage: The family of Kendrick Johnson today claimed an expert analysis suggests the released CCTV footage was doctored to blur a figure walking near the corpse. While some of the footage is clear, the camera pointed toward the mat is blurry

Doctored? Chavene King, a Johnson family attorney, told MailOnline today that an expert took a close look at the video footage captured by motion-activated cameras and discovered ¿a very suspicious image¿

But Johnson’s family suspected foul 
play, claimed the police have taken part in a cover-up all along and 
have been campaigning for justice ever since.

Part of their campaign has been to fight for surveillance footage from the gym on the day Kendrick died to be released. 

His parents reported him missing that
 evening when he failed to return home but his body was not discovered 
until the following morning. He was last seen on school cameras at 
1:09pm on January 10.

A few weeks ago, the police handed 
the family footage from the high school gym. But, rather than giving the
 family the answers they desperately need, they have been left with more
 questions.

Missed: The death of Kendrick Johnson, 17, was ruled accidental but his parents believe he was killed

Chavene King, a Johnson family 
attorney, told MailOnline today that an expert took a close look at the 
video footage captured by motion-activated cameras and discovered ‘a 
very suspicious image’.

‘That evening there is a blurry 
figure after the hour that the school had closed and you see what is a 
silhouette of somebody walking in the area of the mat.’

King pointed to footage captured from camera ‘G-5’ in the gym aimed at the wrestling mats was what drew his concern.

‘The level of clarity of that image is far, far more pixelated than the same image at approximately 9am on that morning.’

While King stresses his impression of
 the footage is ‘preliminary’, he believes the varying quality of the 
image coupled with frequent absent time codes raises more suspicions. 

‘I don’t know if it is the result of 
somebody photoshopping this piece but it lacks time code data,’ he said.
 ‘In the morning image you have time codes but in the evening images you
 don’t.’

Questions: His family's attorneys, Chevene King (left) and Benjamin Crump (right), pictured on CNN said that the footage has been doctored and that key parts are blurry and dark

Distraught: Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson have been calling for justice since their son died in January

Lt. Stryde Jones, of the Lowndes County Sherriff’s Office, maintains the video was not doctored.

‘We have never edited that video. We don’t even have the capabilities to edit the video.’

He said the CCTV footage that was ultimately turned over was stored in a chip.

‘The video chip we had was not the total video-it was a chip.’

Earlier this year they demanded 
Kendrick’s body was exhumed. A private autopsy was then carried out and 
found that the Kendrick Johnson, who went by the congenial moniker 
‘K.J.’, died by a blow to the neck and also revealed that the boy’s 
organs were replaced with newspaper.

The family also released a gruesome 
image of Kendrick’s bloated and apparently beaten face when he was in 
the mat, fueling their suspicions.

The controversial case is being 
reviewed by U.S. Attorney for Middle Georgia Michael Moore who has 
brought in the FBI to determine if Kendrick Johnson was killed.

Twist: When his body was exhumed for further investigations, it was found to be missing its organs and stuffed with newspaper instead. An independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma
