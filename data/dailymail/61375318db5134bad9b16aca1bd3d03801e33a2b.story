HMV gift cards worth £7million are to be honoured in a victory for consumer power.

Deloitte, the administrators brought in to run the music chain last week, had initially ruled the cards were worthless. 

The climbdown brings good news to around 350,000 people, many of whom were given the vouchers for Christmas.

Struggling: HMV announced it would stop accepting gift cards after going into administration last week, but has now made a U-turn and will honour them from Tuesday

The entertainment chain came under 
fire from disappointed customers when it announced last week that 
millions of pounds of gift cards were now worthless as it seeks to 
restructure its debts and cut costs.

But
from tomorrow stores will begin accepting the cards once more, a move 
which could help keep customers on side as the firm continues to 
struggle.

The High Street giant went into administration under Deloitte last week, putting more than 4,000 jobs at risk after years of suffering from the effects of digital downloads and online retailers.

The firm is believed to have attracted interest from a restructuring specialist which has drawn the support of record labels keen to avoid being at the mercy of the likes of Amazon, Apple and Tesco.

Around £10million worth of gift cards were set to become completely worthless as their holders became unsecured creditors, who are typically the last people to be repaid during bankruptcy proceedings.

However, Deloitte announced today that the cards would be honoured during the period of administration, starting on Tuesday.

They also confirmed that the money raised from charity records such as a single intended to help victims of the Hillsborough disaster would be paid out in full.

'The ability of Administrators to honour gift vouchers will depend on the specific circumstances of each case,' joint administrator Nick Edwards said in a statement.

'Since our appointment as Joint Administrators on Tuesday afternoon, we have been urgently assessing the Companies’ financial position.

'I am pleased to confirm that, having concluded this assessment, we are able to honour gift cards.  I can also confirm that all money raised by HMV for various charities will be paid in full.

'We recognise that both of these matters have caused concern for individuals and organisations affected and are pleased to have reached a positive outcome.'

Fears that consumers would lose out on gift vouchers and cards last week prompted experts to call for an urgent change in the rules.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said it was 'outrageous' that consumers were left out of pocket when retailers refused to honour gift vouchers.

In trouble: Browsing in record shops has been hit by the rise of online shopping and downloads

Deja vu: The gift card U-turn is similar to what happened at Comet before it closed last year

Customers are likely to rush to 
redeem their cards as quickly as possible in case the firm goes out of 
business or changes its mind once again.

The turnaround is reminiscent of Deloitte's takeover of electrics retailer Comet last year.

On that occasion, the company stopped accepting gift cards when it went into administration, only to reverse the decision two days later.

Comet shut down entirely in December, swiftly followed by Jessops, another company to be hit hard by the rise of digital media.

The day after HMV entered administration, video rental chain Blockbuster followed suit, adding to the economic carnage on the High Street.

However, HMV is widely expected to be taken over by a new owner soon, with Hilco - which already owns HMV Canada - thought to be in the forefront of possible buyers.

Music labels and film studios are considering propping the company up by easing credit terms over fears the disappearance of the UK's only chain of record shops would lead to a collapse in CD and DVD sales.

Even if the company is bought, dozens of its stores are likely to be closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs.
