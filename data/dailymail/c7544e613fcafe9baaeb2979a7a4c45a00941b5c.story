Apology: Jenny Kleeman, pictured reporting from Nigeria in 2011, was told to stop breast-feeding her son, but stood her ground

A mother has won an apology from a London shopping centre after a security guard tried to stop her breastfeeding in public.

Jenny Kleeman, a journalist and film-maker, was feeding her son in a café at the O2 shopping centre in Hampstead, North London, when she was asked to leave by security.

She was told to move upstairs out of view next to a collection of nappy bins to feed the child, six-month-old Benjamin, after a guard intervened.

However, Ms Kleeman stood her ground and forced the centre - as well as the Apostrophe café she was sitting in - to make an unreserved apology to her.

She said: 'I was feeding my son, incredibly discreetly, with a friend of mine when a security guard approached me.

'I
 said I was fine at the table, and he said it was not allowed. When I 
challenged him saying it was against the law to try to prohibit me, he 
said it was private property and he did not make the rules.

Representatives of Apostrophe later claimed that the guard was acting in response to a complaint from another customer.

But Ms Kleeman - who has reported from war zones as well as going undercover for months to pull off stories - refused to back down and continued feeding her son.

She told the Evening Standard: 'I
 think the security guard did not really know who he was picking on. I 
know women who may not feel confident enough to stand up to something 
like that. I was not going to use a poo-filled box feeding ghetto.

A spokesman for the O2 centre - who were responsible for the guard, rather than Apostrophe, said: 'Iit is not our policy to prevent breast feeding anywhere within the O2 Centre, or indeed any of our shopping centres, and the security guard who spoke to you did not act in line with our policy.'

A representative of Apostrophe said: 'We would never prevent a mother from feeding her child. Our apologies once again for the disruption and upset this has caused.'
