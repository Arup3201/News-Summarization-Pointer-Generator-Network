A former beauty queen embroiled in a divorce battle with a Laura Ashley boss has been criticised by a High Court judge for demanding £135,000 a year to spend on holidays.

Pauline Chai, who was Miss Malaysia in 1969, has asked for £85,000 a month from her estranged husband Khoo Kay Peng.

The figure includes £135,000 a year to cover first-class flights, suites at five-star hotels and chauffeurs.

But Mrs Justice Roberts said Miss Chai’s claims were ‘hardly frugal’ and ‘in excess’ of what she was likely to spend.

The judge had been asked to decide how much Dr Khoo, 76, the non-executive chairman of Laura Ashley Holdings, should give to Miss Chai to cover her living expenses pending a final decision on their battle over an estimated £200million fortune.

Miss Chai, 68, had asked for ‘interim maintenance’ of more than £85,000 a month to cover her ‘needs’, including holidays.

Lawyers for Dr Khoo described the budget as ‘staggering’.

Mrs Justice Roberts, who analysed arguments on interim payments at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, has concluded that Dr Khoo should pay £50,000 a month.

Miss Chai’s lawyers said she had ‘suffered reductions’ since the separation.

They said she had stopped physiotherapy treatment, had started to ‘cut and dye’ her own hair, had not been going on holidays and had stopped her ‘expensive’ hobby of renovating doll houses.

Mrs Justice Roberts said Miss Chai could not be left ‘high and dry’ or given ‘carte blanche’. But she rejected her claims of a ‘frugal existence’, adding: ‘The wife, in her written evidence, speaks of the measures she has been obliged to take in order to economise in recent months.

‘She says she has had to sell jewellery and borrow from friends. She explains that she can no longer afford trips to her hairdresser in central London but instead has to cut and dye her own hair.

‘Her budget for such expenses is £450 a month, or £5,400 per annum.

‘I am slightly surprised that this economy has had to be made given the sums she is claiming in respect of other living expenses.

Argument: Miss Chai says they moved their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating last year, and she wants decisions made in an English court

‘I am unable to accept the picture which she paints of a somewhat frugal existence. I view the sums claimed as being in excess of what she is likely to spend while she is so deeply enmeshed in this on-going litigation.’

She said she thought payments of £45,000 a month ‘reasonable and fair’. In mid-2013, Miss Chai was given an interim lump sum of £1.85million, said Mrs Justice Roberts. She added that between May 2013 and February 2014, Miss Chai had spent £950,000 on ‘living expenses and outgoings’.

In October, Miss Chai told another hearing that she owned 1,000 pairs of shoes.

Dr Khoo and Miss Chai both come from Malaysia and have five children. They married in December 1970 and separated after 42 years together.

Miss Chai wants to fight the court case in England, while her husband wants the hearings to be held in Malaysia. He says his former wife wants to fight in England because an English court will be more generous.
