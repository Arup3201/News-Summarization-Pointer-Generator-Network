An exhausted leopard seal in need of a good sleep was spotted seeking refuge from the serious swell battering the New South Wales coast on Monday.

The young seal lay sprawled out in the sand on Avalon Beach on Sydney's northern beaches, looking somewhat sad as he struggled to get some shut eye.

The cute creature was seen flopped on his front with his flippers by his side and tail straight out behind it, covered in sand with his eyes closed.

In another shot the seal had opened his eyes slightly and rolled over on to his back, baring the lighter coloured fur on his belly.

However authorities are very concerned for the welfare of the 'underweight' animal, who is originally from the Antarctic region south of Australia.

'He's a long way from home, we've had very very big seas over the last four to five days so the seals are getting bounced and pounded around in the waves,' Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORCCA) Vice President Shona Lorigan told the Daily Mail Australia.

Officers from ORRCA and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service were at the beach keeping an eye on the seal, but he slipped back into the sea before a vet arrived to do an assessment.

This time of year is the most common for seals to be sighted along the coast of NSW, but it is very rare to see leopard seals as their main habitat is in the Antarctic and sub-antarctic regions.

'We wish that the seal could have stayed a shore so we could have had a look at it,' Ms Lorigan said. ORRCA is hoping the animal will reappear along the coast in the morning so they can check on its health.

Ms Lorigan also assured that the creature was not injured, but she is concerned about its survival as it is visibly underweight.
