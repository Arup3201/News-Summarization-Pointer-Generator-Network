Since the sale of marijuana was legalised last year, smokers in Colorado have been able to get their fix from a number of places, including shops and vending machines.

Now enthusiasts will be able to light up in the state's first 'Bud and Breakfast'.

The Adagio in Denver is being transformed from a traditional bed and breakfast to what owners believe is the first hotel of its kind in the United States.

Living the high life: The Adagio in Denver, Colorado, is being transformed into a 'bud and breakfast' where guests will be given marijuana

Guests will have the luxury of unlimited food, drink and, what the company claims, is 'the
 best marijuana and marijuana edibles Colorado has to offer'.

They will
 also have access to an on-site chef available to prepare gourmet food 
cooked to order.

However, the venue only has six rooms and is building a reputation for its liberal policy.

Owners of the Victorian house do not let  guests smoke inside, but do allow it in their garden.

Joel C. Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pladeo said: 'We are excited about this opportunity to take over the Adagio, a
 beautiful Victorian mansion located in downtown Denver.

'Our concept is 
to provide our guests with a complete all-inclusive package where they 
can enjoy the marijuana lifestyle without having a care in the world.

'The Adagio is our pilot project in the marijuana-friendly lodging 
industry. If our concept is successful, we intend to expand through the 
leasing or acquisition of additional inns and Bed and Breakfast 
establishments.'

Helen Strader, owner of the Adagio, added: 'We are pleased to be 
involved with The MaryJane Group and applaud their innovative plan to 
transform our Adagio Bed and Breakfast to a Bud and Breakfast.'

Mary Jane Co., the company behind the project, also offer cannabis tours and involved with a marijuana-friendly radio station.

Yesterday, it was revealed that a vending machine dispensing marijuana has been set up in Colorado so recreational users can get their hands on the drug more easily. 

Colorado made roughly $2 million in 
marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in 
the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, 
though local licensing kept some from opening in January.
