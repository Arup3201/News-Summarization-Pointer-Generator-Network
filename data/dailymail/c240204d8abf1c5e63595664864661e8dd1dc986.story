Four teachers at a London school have been arrested over claims they beat pupils aged just five.

The four allegedly slapped, punched and applied Chinese burns to children in their care.

The offences allegedly took place at the Â£8,000-a-year Chrysolyte Independent Christian School in Southwark, South London.

Officers from Lambeth's Child Abuse Investigation Team launched an investigation in July after police received an allegation of assault on a 10-year-old girl that is alleged to have taken place on the 17 January.

One mum, speaking to The Sun, claims her son of ten, who has special needs, had his arm twisted behind his back and was punched. At least eight parents have taken kids out of the school in Southwark, South London.

A staff member told the newspaper: 'Police told me schools inspectors are thinking of closing it.'

A Met police spokesman said: 'On August 6 a 49-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of ABH.

'On September 4 a 56-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of ABH.

'On Wednesday October 17 two further arrests were made. The 48-year-old and 33-year-old women were arrested on suspicion of child cruelty and taken into custody.

'Those arrested work at the school.'

All four were bailed until December.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
