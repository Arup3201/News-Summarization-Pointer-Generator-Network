Separated from the rest of its herd, a stranded cow appears resigned to the idea that it has nowhere else to go, after becoming stuck climbing over a crash barrier.

Fortunately for this adventurous calf however, help was on its way after Jason Weigner spotted it while driving near Chochis in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

Mr Weigner became its saviour as he and his wife Jenna pulled over to help rescue the calf after nearly driving past it.Â

Fortunately for this adventurous calf however, help was on its way after Jason Weigner spotted it while driving near Chochis in Santa Cruz, Bolivia

The 31-year-old said: 'It seemed pretty resigned to the fact it was stuck and it probably was on for at least ten to 15 minutes.

'It did not seem scared until I went over to help it as up to that point, it was pretty calm.

'When I went over to help it, it suddenly acted scared and tried to get off.

'It flailed around a bit before realising forward was not its only option and tried backing off the rail.

'Once it did that it was able to get free and tumbled down the hill behind the rail, before picking itself up and joining the rest of the herd.'

According to Mr Weigner, from Coupeville in Washington, large herds on either side of the road regularly graze in the area.

Having lived previously in Bolivia for two years, he had never seen anything like it before - and neither had the locals.

He said: 'When I was going back through my photos and saw the cattle crossing sign I laughed and though that fitted pretty well with this event.'
