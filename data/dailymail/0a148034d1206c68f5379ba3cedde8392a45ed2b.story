Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes has signed a two-year contract extension.

The 24-year-old, who scored 25 goals last season for the Ewood Park outfit, has committed his future to Rovers for the next five years by extending his current deal until the summer of 2019.

'I'm delighted, I'm very happy,' the striker told Rovers Player. 'It is a fantastic football club and I'm very lucky to be here.
