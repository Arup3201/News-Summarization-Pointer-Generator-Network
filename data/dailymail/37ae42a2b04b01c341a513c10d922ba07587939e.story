MPs are to spend just two and a half days a week in Parliament after Michael Gove told them they were not likely to be needed on Thursdays.

The government chief whip has informed Tory MPs that there will be no major legislation on Thursday afternoons for the foreseeable future.

It means they will arrive in Westminster on Monday lunchtime and could leave on Wednesday afternoons.

Chief  whip Michael Gove has told Tory MPs that Thursdays will be one-line whips, which means there will be no major legislation or debates

The House of Commons has all but ground to a halt in recent months, with almost no legislation to debate.

The coalition has reached a logjam, with the Tories and Lib Dems unable to agree on major new laws with six months until the election.

This week saw the final stages of the Childcare Payments Bill debated on Monday and the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill passed last night.

But today the government has given Labour time to force a vote on the European Arrest Warrant.

Tomorrow is given over to backbench business on ‘money creation and society’ and ‘devolution and the union’.

Mr Gove has sent an email to Tory MPs making clear that in future all Thursdays will be a one-line whip – meaning that are not required to attend.

The Commons was almost empty during a debate on Iran on Thursday November 6. The scene is likely to be repeated in the coming weeks

David Cameron suffered a humiliating first defeat on a Coalition bill today after more than 40 MPs rebelled in a vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer.

The Government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to purchase drinks from different brewers, but ministers were left embarrassed after they failed to head-off the backbench rebellion.

Chief Whip Michael Gove faced shouts of ‘resign’ and ‘well done, Chief Whip’, after 17 Conservatives and 24 Liberal Democrats voted against the Coalition Government in its first legislative defeat since 2010.

The rebellion was particularly embarrassing for Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson, who had spoken for the Government during the debate, after the rebels included her husband Duncan Hames.

Matt Hancock, who was one of the ministers responsible for the bill, was reportedly seen ‘grovelling’ to the Prime Minister after the vote.

Some of the absent MPs are thought to have been  campaigning ahead of the Rochester and Strood by-election.

Departmental questions are held on Thursday mornings, so some MPs will be present.

And others will be in Westminster for Thursday afternoon debates or meetings.

But many will be able to return to their constituencies to work, and campaign for re-election in May next year.

One Tory MP said: ‘Michael was saying that Thursdays are generally a one-line whip. He was emphasising as part of a bigger memo that they are likely to remain one-line whips.’

With no crunch votes to stay for, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are also likely to depart from Westminster to return home to campaign for votes.

A Conservative spokesman said: 'As advice to Conservative MPs made explicitly clear, if there is a three line whip then MPs will be required to be in parliament, just as has always been the case. 

'And just as has always been the case, if there is not a three line whip, they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead.'

Despite running out of major legislation, the coalition will go on until May because of a law passed in 2010 creating fixed-term parliaments of five years.

It was imposed to prevent the sudden collapse of the power-sharing deal between the Tories and Lib Dems.

But critics say it means the government has run out of steam and will limp on for months.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg yesterday defended the move. He told MPs: ‘We have legislated for a fixed-term parliament.

‘That is an important constitutional innovation. I personally think that coalition Governments of different compositions are more likely in future.

‘That is why, among many other reasons, it is important that we do what we say and see through this Parliament from end to end until May 2015.’
