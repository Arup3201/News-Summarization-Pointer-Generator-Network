Hannah Miley had earlier won gold to retain her 400m individual medley title, executing a brilliant tactical and gutsy display to surge past England's Amy Willmott in the final 100m.

The Scot sprang a surprise by going out quickly and leading after the butterfly, normally one of her weaker disciplines, but Willmott hit back during the backstroke and remained five hundredths of a second ahead as the pair turned after the breaststroke.

What happened next was so different two years ago at London 2012, when Miley was heavily tipped to win a medal on the opening day in the pool but was blown away into fifth position by Chinese 16-year-old sensation Ye Shiwen. There were tears of a very different kind that day and, you sense, a determination to make sure she never felt like that again.

England lawn bowlers Doreen Flanders and Steve Simmons, with combined age of 122, beat their Australian opponents 17-13 in the first round of the B2/B3 mixed pairs, for bowlers with visual impairments. Flanders, 79, is the oldest member of Team England, yet took up bowling relatively recently: in 1997, aged 62.

That showed itself last night as petite 
5ft 5in smiley Miley powered past Willmott in the final 100m, her 
freestyle allowing her to smash her own Games record with a time of 
4mins 31.76secs. She covered the last 50m in just 31.21secs.

Judoka Kimberley Renicks denied Miley the honour of winning Scotland's first gold medal at these Games as she claimed victory in the under 48kg class shortly before 7pm. But the honour of hearing 'Flower of Scotland' inside Tollcross Swimming Centre for the first time belonged to Miley.

She did not seem to know whether to sing, cry or smile on the podium, and who could blame her; such was the maelstrom of emotion swelling around this intimate arena.

Miley's father Patrick, a former solider who works as a helicopter pilot as well as coaching his daughter, broke down in tears and was the first family member to give Miley a hug as she embarked on a lengthy lap of honour, draped in the Scottish flag.

Miley said: 'That was just incredible. It’s just amazing to get that time and show that the hard work has paid off.

‘Me and my Dad have done so much. We’ve gone against the grain and it’s been a tough year.

‘I’ve had my scalp taken a couple of times and I’ve had to stop, take stock and ask: “Is it really working? Am I going in the right direction?”

‘But I totally trust the work that my Dad has done and it has just all worked – thankfully.’

England's Siobhan O'Connor, only 18 years old, won silver in the 200m freestyle and James Guy earned bronze in the 400m freestyle.
