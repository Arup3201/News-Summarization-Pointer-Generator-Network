Fed up with incessantly rising food prices? Then maybe you should take a leaf out of the book of this young man, who always has a fully stocked fridge but never spends a penny at the checkout.

For Maximus Thaler one man's rubbish is his treasure as he stocks his fridge full of the food he finds in dustbins.

From fresh vegetables and eggs to juicy steaks and ready-made meals, Mr Thaler scavenges food from supermarket bins and uses it to cook delicious meals for himself, his friends and even the local community.

Oh, to be young and freegan: Maximus Thaler and a
friend. The thrifty 22-year-old spends nothing on eating since he 
scavenges all his food from supermarket dustbins around Somerville, Massachusetts

A good haul: Some of the food found by Maximus 
and his freegan friends who dig through bins nightly in search of edible
food, flowers and any other usable items as part of their efforts to 
live an anti-consumerist lifestyle

Fully stocked: Mr Thaler's fridges groan under the weight of food he and friends have recovered from rubbish

A bath full of the juices Mr Thaler and friends have found: 'You can find anything you see on the shelves in a supermarket in the bin, organic vegetables, fruit, juices, eggs, milk, yoghurt,' he said

Dining on food from a bin may not sound like the ingredients for a perfect meal to most, but for Mr Thaler 'dumpster diving' is a way of life.

The thrifty 22-year-old from Somerville, Massachusetts, is a Freegan, which means he adopts an anti-consumerist lifestyle. He opposes materialism, conformity and greed and believes in consuming little and wasting less.

Mr Thaler and his band of fellow freegans dig through bins in search of edible food, flowers and any other usable items.

They then sift through the gleaned goodies and determine which are useful. Rotten food is thrown away and salvageable food is washed and used to make meals.

Mr Thaler and fellow freegans beam with delight 
at their haul of food: Mr Thaler said he's been raiding dustbins since 
he was at university, but it is only since last summer he has survived 
exclusively off found food

Who needs food banks? As this picture shows, Mr Thaler and friends have more food than they can store

Overflow: They are even forced to keep some of their massive haul outside on the verandah

Variety is the spice of life: Since everything 
is free, they can afford to have several different kinds of potatoes in 
their larder - plus sweet potatoes to boot

Mr Thaler said: 'I started dumpster diving when I was at university, there was a group of freegan's who regularly got together at the nearby supermarket.

'I've been a freegan for around four years now but since last summer I've got all my food from a dumpster.

'You can find anything you see on the shelves in a supermarket in the bin, organic vegetables, fruit, juices, eggs, milk, yoghurts. Absolutely anything.

'When I first heard of dumpster diving I really wrestled with the idea, what does it mean to buy food in a supermarket and then see that same food in thrown away?

'There's a bunch of food that's thrown
away, just because of a packaging default. No-one wants to buy 
something where the packaging is torn so the supermarket can't sell that
and throw it away.

'Sometimes they'll be a box of a dozen
eggs where one yolk has broken and there's egg on the box, so it's 
thrown away even though 11 of the eggs are perfectly fine.

'Supermarkets
also purposely buy more than they can sell so their shelves look 
plentiful and that excess food ends up in the bin.

'Expiration
dates also a reason why good food is often binned, they say it expires 
but there's no legal guidance on expiration dates and the food is still 
perfectly fine to eat after it is said to have expired.

'The problem is an economic one, it's not as easy as telling supermarkets to give this food away instead of throwing it away.

'We
shouldn't be shopping at large grocery or convenience stores and 
instead buying quantity in bulk from local distributors or farmers 
markets.'

Cooking up a storm: Mr Thaler has been able to scavenge so much food from bins that it's too much for him to eat, so in order to make the most of this free food he started sharing it with his community

Mr Thaler and his friends in 
Massachusetts aren't the only Americans embracing the Freegan trend. In 
New York, as economic hard times continue for many, Freegan groups have 
sprung up running tours of the city's bins.

One
group organises monthly 'trash tours' so that people can seek the best 
places for free food, sourced potatoes, peppers, packaged salads, 
yogurts, pasta, bread rolls and hummus and make their own burgers and 
barbecue food from the ingredients.

Organiser
Janet Kalish, who has been practising Freeganism for two decades, said:
'We're finding these tours to be extremely popular.

'They
are filling up with newcomers who are shocked by the level of waste and
who now realise what they can recover from supermarket bins.

'Once
a month, we invite new attendees to come on our trash tours of the 
village and then for a meal the next day with the food we've recovered.

'There
is no reason for this food to be thrown out. It is just as good now as 
it was 20 minutes ago when it was in the supermarket.

'Many
of the Freegans are young professionals who are environmentally and 
politically conscious, but we also find that many of them are people who
cannot afford the high cost of food in New York City.'

Free flowers: Food isn't the only thing Mr Thaler finds in supermarket dustbins. Here he gives away blooms

Back in Somerville, Mr Thaler has been able to scavenge so much food from bins that it's too much for him to eat, so in order to make the most of this free food he started sharing it with his community.

He now plans to open his own Freegan café called the The Gleaners' Kitchen, where he plans to serve the food to diners for free.

He had planned to do this from his home but he was evicted after the landlord found out about his plans.

He is now looking for a more suitable venue for his café.
