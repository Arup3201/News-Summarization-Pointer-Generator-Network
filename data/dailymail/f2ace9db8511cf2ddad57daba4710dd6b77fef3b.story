South Korean jets and U.S. attack helicopters set the skies alight today as the two nations conducted spectacular live fire drills which were the biggest since the Korean War.

The 'war games' and huge explosions south of the Korean border today came amid escalating tensions between Korea's north and south countries, and included a 'provocative' gesture where a North Korean flag was used as a target.

The drill at Poncheon, near the heavily-armed North Korean border, involved 2,000 troops along with jet fighters, tanks, Apache attack helicopters, A-10 'tank-killer' aircraft, missiles and multiple rocket launchers.

The exercises were intended to mark this week's 62nd anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950, which ended in a truce, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically at war.

Military allies Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. are set begin a three-day naval exercise in the Yellow Sea this weekend, which could further raise tensions around North Korea.

Todays drills, involving 2,000 troops from the U.S. and South Korea, are intended to send a clear warning against North Korea aggression by showing U.S. and South Korean combat readiness, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a statement.Â

Officials have described these as the biggest ever joint drills. They coincide with several days of joint naval exercises involving a nuclear-powered U.S. supercarrier and separate U.S., South Korean and Japanese naval rescue drills.

A U.S. military spokeswoman, Jennifer Buschick, wouldn't comment on the flag, deferring to the South Korean military.

Live-fire drills by the allies are fairly routine, but using the North's national flag as part of target practice is unusual - and will be seen as a provocation by Pyongyang, which has previously threatened war for what it called South Korean insults to the country's national symbols and leadership.

Still, an immediate North Korean 
military retaliation is unlikely. The rockets didn't hit the flag, which
an analyst said might lead to a less angry North Korean response.

But
even a direct attack on the flag would probably only result in 
escalated North Korean threats because Pyongyang's struggling economy 
prevents it from staging any attack that could cause a war, said Koh 
Yu-hwan, a North Korea professor at Seoul's Dongguk University.

A
South Korean defense official, who declined to be named because of 
office policy, said the flag was meant to mark enemy territory during 
the drills, but he wouldn't comment on Pyongyang's possible reaction to 
use of the North Korean flag in the drills.

North
Korea's state media have condemned the ongoing drills as a precursor to
an invasion, with the Korean Central News Agency warning that even a 
small clash could lead to a 'full-scale regional nuclear war.'

Tension
has been rising since a North Korean rocket launch in April that Seoul 
and Washington called a cover for a test of banned long-range missile 
technology.

North
Korea said the launch, which happened during celebrations of the 
centennial of late national founder Kim Il Sung's birth, was meant to 
send a satellite into orbit; the rocket broke apart shortly after 
liftoff.

The U.N. Security 
Council condemned the launch, and Pyongyang has since made a series of 
threats against Seoul's conservative government and media, vowing to 
attack unless it got an apology for perceived insults against the 
country and its new, young leader, Kim Jong Un.

Thousands of civilians and officials - including South Korea's prime minister - watched Friday's drills.

The
United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a 
deterrent against North Korea, deployed Apache helicopters, A-10 
Thunderbolts and armored vehicles for the drills, Seoul's Defense 
Ministry said in a statement.

Kim Jong Un took power as supreme 
leader of North Korea and its 1.2 million troops after his father, 
longtime ruler Kim Jong Il, died in December.

North
Korea has condemned what it calls Seoul's insensitivity to Kim Jong 
Il's death and South Korean media criticism of important national events
in the North.

In recent 
months, North Korea has ramped up harsh rhetoric against South Korean 
President Lee Myung-bak, who ended Seoul's no-strings-attached aid to 
Pyongyang after he took office in 2008, with posters and slogans that 
repeatedly call Lee a 'rat.'

North Korea has also 'drastically' increased fighter jet drills near the border with South Korea in the first half of this year, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said, declining to be named because of office rules.

The official wouldn't provide further details.

On Thursday, the navies of the United States, South Korea and Japan began two-day annual search and rescue exercises near the southern South Korean island of Jeju.

Starting Saturday, the United States and South Korea planned three-day naval exercises off South Korea's west coast that include the aircraft supercarrier USS George Washington.
