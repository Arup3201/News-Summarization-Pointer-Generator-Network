Britain's coasts were battered by huge waves today as cars were dug out of the snow and vehicles struggled in difficult driving conditions.

Violent gusts of 70mph were expected in northern areas, with more regular gale-force blasts of up to 60mph causing hazards for motorists.

But while five flood alerts and one warning remained in place across the UK today, the worst effects of the 50ft ‘supertide’ have now subsided.

Cornwall: The swells were caused by the position of the moon, which is closer to the Earth than usual and causing a stronger gravitational pull

Outlook: This week forecasters predict temperatures in London and the South West could rise to 12C (54F) tomorrow and on Thursday

Current earth wind speeds: Violent gusts of 70mph were expected in northern areas, with more regular gale-force blasts of up to 60mph

The swells were caused by the position of the moon, which is closer to the Earth than usual and causing a stronger gravitational pull.

Now, this week forecasters predict temperatures in London and the South West could rise to 12C (54F) tomorrow and on Thursday.

Temperatures in northern cities including Sheffield and Manchester tomorrow could be 9C (48F), but by Friday the high could be down to 6C (43F).

And the weather will remain unsettled all week, despite there being no severe weather warnings in place for the next five days.

Met Office meteorologist Laura Young told MailOnline: ‘The winds have calmed right down now - generally the blustery weather is out of the way. 

‘We’ve got a band of patchy rain and potentially sleet on higher ground, and snow on much higher ground in Scotland and northern England.

‘Tomorrow will have a clear start, and in northern areas you’re likely to see a bit of frost. Then we’ve got a warm front coming through.

‘That means that temperatures are likely to be quite warm tomorrow, and in some places you could see into double figures.’

She added that tomorrow night into Thursday morning will be windier, with more rainfall hitting the west coast, and heavy showers in the South East.

Yesterday’s wettest area was Tyndrum in the Scottish Highlands, which saw 1.6in (41mm), while the warmest was Gravesend in Kent at 9.4C (49F).

An Environment Agency spokesman said today: ‘As expected, we saw some localised flooding of low-lying land but have not received confirmed reports of any property flooding.

‘From today high tides drop but with an unsettled forecast for the rest of the week we’d encourage people to continue to check their flood risk on the GOV.UK website.’
