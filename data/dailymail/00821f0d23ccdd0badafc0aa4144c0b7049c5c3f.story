A seaside village once so famous for its oysters it was named after them is celebrating – now that the long-departed shellfish have returned.

In Victorian times the fishing village of Oystermouth, which overlooks Swansea Bay, sold the delicacy at markets in London and across Europe.

But the trade died out in the 1920s as pollution destroyed the oyster beds.

The annual Mumbles Oyster and Seafood Festival which attracts 8,000 visitors each year welcomed the return of the delicacy

Oystermouth is celebrating - because the shellfish the village is named after have made a come back nearly a century after being wiped out

Experts have revealed oysters are now growing and breeding in the sea off Swansea Bay

Marine biologists released 40,000 oysters into the sea last winter in an attempt to repopulate the bay.

The shellfish are now breeding, and experts hope that within five years the village's livelihood could be revived.

Dr Andy Woolmer, who worked with Cambridge University on the project, said: 'The water is so much cleaner now and the oysters seem to be happy.

'Not only have the oysters survived the harsh winter last year, they also grew in size and, crucially, managed to spawn.

'Going forward, it means that the oysters we've put in represent a brood stock that could repopulate the bay.

'There is great potential for another wild fishery and that could happen in the next five years.'

More than 18 million oysters were landed by the village’s fishermen in 1871 and sent by train to restaurants in London and cities around Europe

The shellfish are sitting on 70-acres of sea bed an area about the size of 35 rugby pitches.

The annual Mumbles Oyster and Seafood Festival which attracts 8,000 visitors each year welcomed the return of the delicacy.

Festival organisers import 3,000 oysters from England each year but are now looking forward to serving up local oysters for the first time.

Spokesman Paul Whittaker said: 'If we could farm the oysters in Swansea Bay it would support local businesses and local industries.

'It would also help us develop our past heritage, to increase the footfall of the area as a tourist destination.'

Oystermouth councillor Tony Colburn said: 'Oyster fishing was extremely important in this area. Its oysters were world famous.

'But this is great news and we can live up to our proud name once again - the oyster is back in Oystermouth.'
