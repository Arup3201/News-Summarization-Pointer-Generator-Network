Hospital bosses have hired a police sniffer dog to stop patients using illegal drugs on the wards.

Coco the cocker spaniel was brought in to Northumberland, Tyne and Wear Foundation trust following concerns that drug dealers were preying on vulnerable patients.

The 15-month-old dog is on duty at a base in Newcastle but can quickly be dispatched to any wards within the six hospitals run by the trust whenever staff raise the alarm.

Smelling a rat: Sniffer dog Coco the Cocker Spaniel has been recruited by Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust to root out drug dealers targeting hospitals

Managers decided to hire a sniffer dog following reports drug dealers were hanging around in hospitals hoping to selling drugs to vulnerable patients.

The trust treats 40,000 patients with mental health problems every year - some are addicts whose illnesses were caused by years of drug abuse.

A dog’s sense of smell is more than 1,000 times as powerful than ours and the moisture on their noses helps trap tiny scent particles.

Wide remit: Coco will be policing six of the trust's hospitals, including St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle, pictured above

Coco underwent about eight week’s training with former police officer John McCarroll who is now also employed by the trust as her handler.

Suresh Joseph, the medical director of the trust, which has hospitals in Newcastle, Sunderland and Northumberland, said: ‘She starts at 9am just like the rest of us. We like to pick up new ideas and run with them.

‘She’s a lovely dog. She is very energetic and lively and charming.

‘Drugs are everywhere in society and people can potentially bring drugs onto the wards. We’ve even had reports in the past of drug dealers hanging around our hospitals.

‘It’s very important for us to ensure our hospital environments are as safe as they can be and Coco is another tool in the box.

‘If there are any concerns or suspicions then staff get in touch with the security team and they send John and Coco along and she will do a search.

‘Drugs and mental illness don’t mix and we need to do everything we can. There is only a small proportion of incidents but they can have a huge impact on vulnerable patients.’

Coco has been working at the hospital for five weeks and bosses say they were inspired by a similar scheme at South West London and St Georges trust, which hired a sniffer dog two years ago.

Managers at that trust say since Paddy - a springer spaniel - arrived the presence of drugs on the wards has been drastically reduced and violence has also gone down as he has a ‘calming’ effect.

Figures show the number of assaults on staff fell from 368 a year in 2008/9, before Paddy arrived, to 217 last year.

Potential sniffer dogs are selected from the litter when they are just eight weeks old and trainers’ check their sense of smell by getting them to hunt for hidden toys.

Usually Spaniels, Border Collies, Labradors and German Shepherds are trained-up as they have particularly strong senses of smell, an instinct for hunting as well as being very athletic.

The dogs live with their handlers -usually police officers - and have a career of between eight and ten years.

Gary O’Hare, director of nursing and operations at the trust, said: ‘Coco and John have been an excellent addition to our staff teams and have already made a massive difference to the way we deal with the problem of illegal drug misuse across our services.

‘The safety of our patients and staff is our main priority and this scheme will ensure we can continue to offer a safe and supportive environment for those receiving treatment, whilst giving people the confidence to report anything they find suspicious, either in our buildings or anywhere in our grounds.’

Dozens of hospitals are flouting government guidelines by allowing ambulance-chasing law firms to tout for business on their premises.

At least 40 NHS trusts – around a quarter of the total – are letting personal injury firms display posters and leaflets in hospital wards and A&E departments to encourage patients to sue.

Some hospitals are receiving tens of thousands of pounds each, according to Sky News.

This is despite Department of Health guidelines, issued repeatedly since 2004, warning that the practice must end.

It says there is ‘no place’ for such advertising, which raises ‘false expectations of large compensation payouts for minor injuries or that directly or indirectly promotes the bringing of frivolous claims’.

The adverts are blamed for fuelling the compensation culture which saw claims against the NHS rise 20 per cent last year.

It emerged recently that the health service has had to set aside more than £20billion for future negligence claims.

As recently as February last year, NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson told trusts the advertising was ‘unwelcome’ and ‘should not be supported’.
