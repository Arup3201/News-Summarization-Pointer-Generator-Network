Chris Rock joined in on the Brian Williams mocking Wednesday night with a filthy routine at a charity event in New York City that kicked off fashion week.

The event for amFar, an HIV/AIDS charity, took place at Cipriani's downtown location, which Rock used in his Williams bashing.

'I'm a little late, I went to the other Cipriani,' Rock said. 'I was uptown. Brian Williams told me it was there. Lying bastard.'

But Rock wasn't done, reports Page Six. 

'Six months' suspension? That's called fired where I'm from': Chris Rock joined in on the Brian Williams mocking Wednesday night with a filthy routine at a charity event in New York City that kicked off fashion week

'Six months' suspension? That's called fired where I'm from. Got more games [off] than Ray Rice.'

Rock also had some fun with his fellow speaker Rosario Dawson.

'I've known Rosario since she was a B-cup,' he said, 'She won our hearts with her...megasmile, her down-to-earth compassion, and the greatest t**s in the business.'

In handing Brian Williams a six-month suspension for misleading viewers, NBC Universal chief Steve Burke says his chief anchor deserves a second chance. Whether he actually gets one is an open question.

Time is renowned for its healing powers but in this case, time also offers reasons for the split to become permanent.

NBC Universal bought time with the suspension, hoping to remove an unflattering spotlight on its most prominent personality after he falsely reported flying in a helicopter hit by an enemy grenade in the Iraq War.

Veteran Lester Holt will fill in. With 'Nightly News' atop the ratings for almost all of Williams' decade-long tenure as its lead anchor - and back into the 1990s with Tom Brokaw - Holt will be watched closely to see if he can maintain that lead. If he can, that may lessen NBC's desire to bring back a more costly anchor with doubts cast on his trustworthiness.

ABC in the past year maintained and even improved its 'World News Tonight' ratings after replacing well-known anchor Diane Sawyer with David Muir. That indicates viewers care more about the content of the broadcasts than its anchors, said Andrew Tyndall, a consultant who monitors the evening newscasts.

'Not only is (Williams) dispensable, the business model is wrong,' he said.
