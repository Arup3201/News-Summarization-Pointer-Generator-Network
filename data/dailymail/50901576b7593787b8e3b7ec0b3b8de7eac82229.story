Kelly Jane Richards has been told she could face prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy

A married mother-of-two broke down in tears after she was told she could be sent to prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy.

Kelly Jane Richards, of South Wales, admitted having sex with the teenager, who is less than half her age. 

The Jehovah's Witness was arrested last December after the child's mother discovered what had happened. 

The 36-year-old had originally denied seducing the teen, but pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child.

Richards sat in the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, South Wales, and broke down in tears as the charge was read to her.

Two elders from the Jehovah's Witness community were sitting at the back of the court to give her support.

The court was told Richards 'did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over' when she had penetrative sex with the schoolboy just two months before his birthday.

The offence took place during term time in 2012, the court heard.  

A second similar charge was left to 'lie on file'.

Sarah Waters, defending, told the court Richards was of 'good character'.

Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards she would be sentenced later this month. 

He added that 'all options remain open' - which includes a custodial sentence. 

He told her: ' You will be sentenced later this month and I am going to ask for a report so the court knows more about you.

'The fact I am asking for a report and granting bail does not give any indication of the sentence I will pass.

'This is a serious matter.

'Obviously I will reserve the matter to myself and all sentencing options remain open to me.'

She was shielded going out of the court by her husband.  

Richards will be sentenced on March 23.
