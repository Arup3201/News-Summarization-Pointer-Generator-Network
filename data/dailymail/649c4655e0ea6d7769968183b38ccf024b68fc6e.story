Another payout: Chief Executive of Barclays Bob Diamond is in line for £2.4million

The row over fatcat pay was reignited yesterday as it emerged that more than 500 bankers at Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland scooped more than £1million last year.

The ‘rampant inequality’ at both lenders was laid bare for the first time, with Barclays revealing that more than 70,000 staff are languishing on less than £25,000.

In another day of shame for British lenders, RBS – 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer – said it awarded 95 staff packages of at least £1million, despite slumping to a £5.2billion loss last year.

One mystery banker was paid more than £5million, while embattled boss Stephen Hester was handed a multi-year package worth up to £3.2million.

This compares with an average RBS pay package of £34,000.

RBS sneaked out the details late yesterday afternoon, hours after Barclays confirmed that there were 428 staff in its  ‘millionaires’ club’.

Its chief executive Antony Jenkins received a package worth £2.6million, despite forfeiting his annual bonus.

Barclays confirmed that Jenkins’s predecessor Bob Diamond is in line for £2.4million in pay and perks in July – a year after he quit in disgrace over the interest rate rigging scandal.

Diamond also amassed a treasure chest of shares worth more than £40million during his 16 years at the bank.

Both lenders provided more information on their bumper pay packages than ever before in their annual reports in an effort to become more transparent.

Barclays said it has 393 ‘code staff’ – executives involved in risk-taking   – who were paid an average of £1.3million. At RBS the 368 ‘code staff’ were on an average of £701,000.

Critics said the huge packages highlighted the yawning pay gap between frontline staff and top executives.

Commenting on Barclays, Dominic Hook, of trade union Unite, said: ‘This is a bank that has been at the centre of some of the worst recent scandals in the City, such as Libor, and there should be no reward for failure at the top of the organisation.

‘The rampant inequality in the pay between the top Barclay executives and those on the frontline who deal directly with customers is shocking and needs to be addressed by the chief executive as a matter of urgency.’

Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre, said it ‘has to be bad for morale and productivity’ that ‘hundreds of staff are paid more than frontline staff will earn in a lifetime’.

Both Barclays and RBS are fighting to restore their reputations.

Barclays was fined £290million for rigging crucial interest rates and has set aside £1.6billion to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance.

But despite efforts to show restraint, its pay packages remain much more generous than rival lenders.

Although the number of Barclays staff in the ‘millionaire’s club’ has fallen to 428 from 473 last year, it is still more than twice the number at HSBC, despite having just over half the number of employees.

Barclays has 145,000 staff while HSBC has around 260,000.
