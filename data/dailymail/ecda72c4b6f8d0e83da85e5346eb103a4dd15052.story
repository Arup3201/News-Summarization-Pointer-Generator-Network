Adam Gemili qualified fastest for Monday's men’s 100 metres semi-finals and said he is capable of breaking the 10-second barrier for the first time to win a medal here in Glasgow.

In a world-class field boasting the likes of Richard Thompson and Nickel Ashmeade, both of whom have run comfortably under 10 seconds this year, it was the 20-year-old Englishman who recorded the fastest time.

We should, of course, not get too carried away with two races for Gemili still to navigate before he could step up onto the podium at Hampden Park, but there is a growing confidence about the former world junior champion.

Flying: Adam Gemili coasted through to the semi-finals of the 100m with a time of 10.15secs

Confident: Gemili believes he can break the 10-second barrier in Glasgow over the next week

He may still refuse to conform to tired sprinting stereotypes by smiling rather than growling at the start of his races, but Gemili now believes he not only belongs along such elite athletes, but that he is capable of beating them.

‘I don’t see why I can’t realistically make the final and hopefully be pushing for a medal. I think I’m going to have to break 10 seconds to get a gold medal, but I feel I have been fit enough to do it for a while, weather-permitting,’ he said. ‘You do have to believe in yourself in sprinting. As much as people say “there are big egos” you do have to have a big confidence in yourself that you can do it and  execute it with the world’s best.

‘Everyone can beaten. It is just how you  prepare yourself on the day.’

But Michael Johnson, the world 400m record-holder, criticised the 20-year-old’s performance on the BBC, advising Gemili to stop looking like he is simply enjoying the occasion.

‘I wasn’t that excited by Gemili’s performance,’ said Johnson. ‘What has impressed me so much over the last couple of years is his technique, and he looked a little tight there.

‘He hasn’t run in a while and he’s been through a coaching change, so that may have something to do with it. When he runs well, I’d like to see him look a little more like he expects that, not like: “Oh my god, that was really great.”’

While it was true Gemili did not coast through his heat like Ashmeade or Thompson, who only qualified as a fastest loser after coming third in 10.33secs, the Englishman’s refusal to take himself too seriously has been a key to his success. He is a former Dagenham and Redbridge full back who only burst onto the scene two years ago.

Impressed: Gemili praised the 'unbelievable' crowd that cheered him on at Hampden Park

While it was true Gemili did not coast 
through his heat like Ashmeade or Thompson, who only qualified as a 
fastest loser after coming third in 10.33secs, the Englishman’s refusal 
to take himself too seriously has been a key to his success. He is a 
former Dagenham and Redbridge full back who only burst onto the scene 
two years ago.

Gemili still combines full-time training with Britain’s fastest active sprinter, James Dasaolu, under coach Steve Fudge in Loughborough — after switching from London-based Michael Afilaka — with studying for a degree in sports and exercise science at the University of East London. Maintaining such a grounded sense of perspective in what could be a dizzying world is no bad thing, surely.

Fellow Englishmen Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Richard Kilty also progressed to today’s semi-finals, running 10.33secs and 10.34secs respectively. But Northern Ireland’s four-time Paralympic champion Jason Smyth, who is legally blind, missed out on a place in the semi-finals after clocking 10.66secs.

Afterwards Kilty, the 60m world indoor champion, dedicated his Commonwealth campaign and season to his close friend David Zikhali, who drowned after swimming in the River Tees on Monday.

Kilty said
 the 20-year-old’s death was ‘absolutely devastating’ and added: ‘David 
was the most loving guy you will ever meet. This Games and the whole of 
my 2014 season will be dedicated to him.’

England’s
 three female 100m sprinters — Bianca Williams, Asha Philip and Sophie 
Papps — all progressed to the semi-finals, with Williams the pick of the
 three in running 11.37secs to finish second in her heat. Nigeria’s 
Blessing Okagbare qualified quickest overall in 11.20secs, with the 
dangerous Jamaican trio of Schillonie Calvert, Veronica Campbell-Brown 
and Kerron Stewart also impressive.

But Trinidad and Tobago's Michelle-Lee Ahye, the second quickest woman in the world this year and one of the favourites for the title, suffered her first 100m defeat for 10 races. The 22-year-old was clearly hampered by her heavily strapped left hamstring as she recorded only 11.52secs, and later withdrew from the Games.

If
 the 44,000-strong Hampden Park crowd were disappointed at the absence 
of double world and Olympic champion Mo Farah from the men’s 5,000m 
final on Sunday night they did not show it; cheering every throw, jump 
and track performance with equal gusto. Disqualifications, false starts,
 dead heats and yet another rendition of The Proclaimers’ ‘I’m Gonna Be 
(500 Miles)’ — spare us please, Glasgow — even seemed to go down well.

Yet
 had Farah, 31, felt he was in good enough shape to take his place on 
the start line, his battle against 5,000m gold medallist Caleb Mwangangi
 Ndiku would have been interesting.

The
 Kenyan has an impressive kick and ran 13mins 12.07secs — significantly 
quicker than Farah managed in his only track outing this season — to win
 the title. Ndiku is only 21: a battle between him and Farah can wait 
for another day.
