Paul Hollywood now has a glittering TV career, but ten years ago, he couldn't afford to pay his creditors

Television breadmaker Paul Hollywood has a half-baked sense for business, according to a string of unhappy creditors left out of pocket after his first bread company went bust.

Liverpool-born Hollywood – star of The Great British Bake Off – set up his company in 1999 after leaving luxury hotel Cliveden, where his skills and charm had won him plaudits  and media attention.

But Hollywood Bread got into financial difficulties within two years. Liquidators were appointed in April 2003 and the company had debts of £262,000 when it was dissolved in December 2005. 

One of the companies his firm owed money to was Bradleys bakers, of Ashford in Kent, which had to write off £2,400.

Managing director Graham Linkins said: ‘In all the coverage I’ve seen about Paul Hollywood, I’ve never read that ten years ago he had a business that went bust.

‘About three years ago, I walked into my front room and saw him on the TV and said, “That b*****d owes me money.”

‘He is not particularly revered within the industry, despite his celebrity.’ 

Steve Foster, former head baker at Hollywood Bread, said: ‘He was a very good, fun-loving character and we got on well, but when his TV career took off that took him away from the business more than it should have.

‘I have not kept in contact with him because of the money issue. I was owed £800. After a while,  I gave up trying to recover the money because I was not getting anywhere with him.’

And former shop manager Gordon Kolb said: ‘The irony was that the business finally crashed on April Fools’ Day, which now seems pretty funny really. But at the time losing out on £1,100 wages was not funny.

‘I have asked him for the money since but he just told me I had to speak to the liquidators.’

Since separating from wife Alex, 49, two months ago after falling for a fellow presenter on the US version of the TV show, Hollywood, 46, has been staying in a converted potting shed in Ickham, Kent.

And despite buying a £135,000 Aston Martin DB9 last month, Hollywood doesn’t own the £800,000 house where Alex and their son Josh, 11, live. 

He sold it to a financier in 2006, shortly before setting up his current firm the Paul Hollywood Artisan Bread Company. 

A spokesman for Paul Hollywood said: ‘I can confirm that in 2003, in common with many businesses, Hollywood Bread went into voluntary liquidation.

'The majority of creditors were compensated.

‘This was not due to neglect – Paul had little TV work at that time – but rather the economic climate and a change in the circumstances surrounding the location of the site involved.’
