Arsene Wenger admitted his side have regrets after finishing second in their Champions League group.

Arsenal beat Galatasaray 4-1 in their final group game, but it wasn't enough to pip Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund to top spot.

Now the Gunners will have to face one of either Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, Bayern Munich, Porto or Monaco.

Wenger praised his side's performance but admitted the situation should have perhaps been different. 

'We had two favourites (in the group) who responded to the fact that they were favourites,' Wenger told Sky Sports 5. 'There are more regrets (about losing) at Dortmund tonight. 

'At home we did the job well and overall we won four games in the group. Perhaps at Anderlecht at home we can regret.' 

Aaron Ramsey and Lukas Podolski both scored twice, but it was the Welshman's second, a 30-yard half-volley, that really caught the eye.

Wenger revealed he was unimpressed when he saw the midfielder taking aim, but was impressed with the end result. 

'When he took the shot I thought that's maybe not the best of ideas but the way it went in was absolutely unbelievable.'

Former Gunner Paul Merson was full of praise for the Welshman and said his second goal was one of the best he'd ever seen. 

Ramsey, though, felt he'd scored better. He said: 'It's up there (with my best). I like the Norwich goal (better).'
