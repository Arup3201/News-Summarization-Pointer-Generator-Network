Britain could send military reinforcements to the Gulf if the dispute with Iran escalates, the Defence Secretary has revealed.

Philip Hammond said the decision to send HMS Argyll as part of an international flotilla of warships through the sensitive Strait of Hormuz on Sunday sent a 'clear signal' to Tehran. And he warned that reinforcements will be available if needed.

Iran has threatened to close the strait - through which 35 per cent of the world's tanker-borne oil exports pass - in retaliation for sanctions against its oil exports.

The news comes after Prime Minister David Cameron last night said Britain 'will not accept' Iran's bid to develop a nuclear weapon.

Mr Hammond was speaking at a press 
conference in London following the annual round of talks between UK and 
Australian foreign and defence ministers.

Australia's foreign minister 
Kevin Rudd said his country would enforce the same ban on Iranian crude 
oil exports agreed by the European Union yesterday. He and defence 
minister Stephen Smith will attend today's National Security Council 
meeting. 

It follows yesterday's rare joint statement 
where German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Nicolas 
Sarkozy and Mr Cameron warned Tehran it would face economic isolation 
unless it abandoned its nuclear ambitions 'immediately'.

They added: 'We have no quarrel with 
the Iranian people. But the Iranian leadership has failed to restore 
international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its 
nuclear programme. We will not accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.'

The statement, which concluded a day 
of intense activity, was backed up by an 'unprecedented' package of EU 
sanctions, designed to suck the lifeblood from the regime – including the 
ban on importing  Iranian oil into Europe.

Tehran responded with defiance, with 
elements of the ruling regime warning it would shut the strategically 
critical Strait of Hormuz – a move that would effectively close the Gulf
 to shipping and send oil prices rocketing.

Threats: Iran has stepped up threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's crude oil flows, in retaliation for facing sanctions

The United States has warned Tehran 
that closing the Strait, which carries one-fifth of the world's oil 
exports, would trigger a massive military response from the West. The 
message was underlined at the weekend when Britain, the U.S. and France 
sent six warships through the Strait.

The tensions come amid mounting concern that Tehran is close to developing a nuclear weapon. After talks to agree the new EU 
sanctions, Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was 'no plausible 
civilian explanation' for Iran's programme of uranium enrichment.

He vowed to keep increasing the pressure on Tehran and said the sanction 'represented a significant increase in peaceful and legitimate pressure on the Iranian government to return to negotiations over its nuclear programme.' He added: 'Until it does so the pressure will only increase.'

Between them, EU member states import 
almost 600,000 barrels a day of Iran's crude oil exports – more than a 
fifth of the total – although only a tiny fraction ends up in the UK. A 
ban on exports of gold, precious metals and diamonds from Iran has also 
been imposed, along with more economic and travel bans on members of the
 hardline regime.

Backing the EU stance, Mr Rudd said: 'It is not just that we endorse the actions taken in Brussels for Europe, we of course will do the same for Australia. The message needs to be delivered to the people of Iran, to the political elites as well as the government of Iran, that their behaviour is globally unacceptable.

'This is not a piece of idle philanthropy on the part of Australian foreign policy, this costs,' he said - pointing to tumbling exports to Iran'. He added: 'But it is a cost worth paying.' Oil imports from Iran to Australia were now 'negligible' however, he said.

Mr Hague urged the regime to 'come to
 its senses' and resume talks on its nuclear programme. Leading figures 
in Tehran responded 
furiously.

Mohammad Kossari, deputy head of the Iranian parliament's 
foreign affairs and security committee, said: 'If any disruption happens
 regarding the sale of Iranian oil, the Strait of  Hormuz will 
definitely be closed.'

Senior politician Heshmatollah 
Falahatpisheh added: 'In case of threat, the closure of the Strait of 
Hormuz is one of Iran's rights.'

British sources believe full closure 
of the Strait remains unlikely because it would bring 'huge negative 
consequences' for Tehran.

But they fear Iran could engage in months of 
threats and disruption which would ramp up oil prices in the West 
without sparking a full military reprisal against Iran. A Royal Navy Type 23 frigate, HMS 
Argyll, was part of the U.S.-led carrier group which passed through the 
strait, which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point.

The USS Admiral 
Lincoln, an aircraft carrier with a fleet of 90 planes, headed the 
group. It was escorted by the Argyll, a guided missile cruiser and two 
destroyers from the U.S. Navy and a French warship.

Insiders said it was unusual for a 
flotilla made up of ships from three separate navies to pass within a 
few miles of the Iranian coastline.

A defence source rejected suggestions 
that it was a provocative move intended to increase pressure on Iran, 
adding: 'It is a statement that makes abundantly clear that these are 
international waters and all countries need to respect that. This shows 
that we are working in partnership and solidarity.'

Professor Paul Stevens, a senior 
research fellow at the think-tank Chatham House, said he doubted Tehran 
would carry out its threat to blockade the strait, for fear of sparking a
 'shooting war' with the U.S. Instead, he said, an oil blockade would 
encourage hardliners in Iran to launch a wave of terror attacks.

Professor Stevens said an oil blockade
 was unlikely to succeed, because Tehran could ship its oil, which makes
 up 50 per cent of its revenues, through pipelines to  Turkey and Egypt.
 He added:  'History is littered with failed oil embargoes. However, the
 lessons of history appear to have passed by the decision makers of the 
EU.'

EU governments are calculating that the loss of European oil markets will persuade Iran to reopen talks on its nuclear plans.

The ban has been phased in partly to ease the impact on EU nations facing economic difficulties and which are very dependent on Iranian oil.

The UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands led calls for nothing more than a three-month delay before the sanctions bite, but Greece, which fears its economic woes will worsen if it cannot find alternative suppliers at Iran-style preferential rates - urged a much longer phase-in to ease the pain.

Mr Hague said an oil embargo was designed to persuade the Iranian government to launch 'meaningful' talks with the international community on its nuclear intentions. Europe's foreign policy chief Baroness Catherine Ashton also insisted the sanctions were needed to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.

An offer to Iran three months ago to begin new talks has gone unanswered, she pointed out.

But concern remains that sanctions designed to hit Iran will inevitably hit some EU member states as well.

Based in Plymouth, HMS Argyll is the longest-serving Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy.

Built in the 1980s on the Clyde, she was commissioned in 1991.

Following a £20m refit in 2009-2010, HMS Argyll is now one of the most up-to-date and capable frigates in the Fleet, with her weapons and sensors significantly enhanced.

HMS Argyll, currently in the Middle East, is part of the Combined Maritime Forces - a US-led, 25-nation, multinational naval partnership promoting security, stability and prosperity across 2.5m sq miles of international waters.

About 40 per cent of the world's shipping and a third of the world's oil passes through the region, most through the chokepoint of the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab-el Mandeb Strait and the Suez Canal.

The ship's main tasks includes counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and building on established relationships with regional allies.
