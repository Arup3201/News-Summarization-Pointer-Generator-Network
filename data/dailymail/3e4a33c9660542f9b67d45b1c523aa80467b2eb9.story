After a brutal day of injury news, England head coach Stuart Lancaster will have been heartened by the sight of Danny Cipriani looking fit and fresh during training on Tuesday.

The Sale Sharks fly half looked in good spirits as he reported for training at England's training base at Pennyhill Park in Surrey.

With Owen Farrell ruled out for the entire England RBS Six Nations with a ‘high-grade’ medial ligament strain, Cipriani will now contest the England No 10 shirt with Bath fly half George Ford and Northampton playmaker Stephen Myler.

Ford is set to retain his spot for England's Six Nations opener against Wales on Friday week after his superb displays against Samoa and Australia during the November Test series.

Cipriani, however, will be targeting the back-up spot on the bench for the clash in Cardiff as he looks to build on his excellent form for Sale this season.

Farrell joins Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes as long-term absentees for England while Saracens centre Brad Barritt suffered a knee injury during his side's 18-6 loss to Clermont in the European Champions Cup on Sunday.

Leicester lock Geoff Parling and Northampton flanker Tom Wood are also in danger of missing the trip to the Welsh capital after suffering injuries last weekend.
