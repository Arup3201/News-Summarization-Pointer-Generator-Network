Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is set to miss England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania with a hamstring strain.

The Arsenal star limped off during the second half of Monday night's FA Cup win over Manchester United.

And Sportsmail understands initial fears are that the midfielder will miss up to four weeks with the injury.
