Sumatran tiger triplets born two months ago have gone on public display Friday at a zoo in Washington state.

The Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma says the triplets are a cause for celebration for the endangered species. 

Only about 300 remain in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. About 400 live in zoos worldwide.

Kirana, Dari and Indah had been behind the scenes with their 11-year-old mother, Jaya, while they put on weight. 

The three female tigers each weighed about three pounds at birth and now weigh about 15 pounds each.

Their births, on October 8, were part of a managed breeding program at the zoo to ensure a genetically diverse population of Sumatran tigers.

'With fewer than 800 Sumatran tigers remaining on the planet, every one is precious,' said Karen Goodrowe Beck, the zoo’s general curator. 

'We want visitors to the zoo to see these magnificent animals and we hope they will take action to help their wild counterparts,' she added.

Members of the public were asked to help name the cubs, choosing from a selection of monikers. In total, 7,140 votes were cast.

The names are derived from Bahasa Indonesia, the Indonesian language. Kirana translates to 'beautiful sunbeam;' Dari is short for Ndari, which means 'full moon' and Indah means 'beautiful one.' 

Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium is home to four Sumatran tigers and one Malayan tiger in addition to Jaya and the cubs.  

The adult tigers rotate daily around several exhibit spaces in the park.
