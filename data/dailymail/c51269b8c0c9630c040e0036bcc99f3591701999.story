A woman who found a brown snake under her caravan tried to smoke the deadly reptile out - with disastrous consequences. 

Police were called to the woman's Berry Springs home, 40 minutes drive south of Darwin in the Northern Territory, on Wednesday night after snake wranglers failed to remove the deadly snake from the premises.

After hatching a plan over a few 'cold drinks', the woman lit a fire underneath her caravan. The result: the caravan, and the shed it was in, burned to the ground.

A Northern Territory Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia there were no injuries but the woman's caravan was destroyed.

'She decided to light a fire to try and flush it out and instead she burnt down her caravan,' she said.

'Emergency services were called. They extinguished the blaze however the caravan is pretty much destroyed completely.'

Emergency services were called to the scene after the blaze got out of control 

Fire and emergency crews were called to the woman's home at about 8:30pm on Wednesday after she saw a brown snake underneath her caravan and set it alight

Fire crews from nearby Humpty Doo were called to the woman's house about 8:30pm and managed to extinguish the blaze.  

'She appears to have had a bit of a think about it and few cold drinks and decided that setting a fire under the caravan might be a way to get rid of this snake,' Police Duty Superintendent Del Jones told ABC.

'However, it just resulted in the caravan being incinerated.' 

The caravan was left in a pile of ashes and was completely destroyed

Police were not able to confirm whether or not the woman was successful in eradicating the snake from her property. 

'Well, we don't know what happened to the snake,' Supt Jones said. 

Speaking to Northern Territory News, Constable Gary Palmer said the woman does not own any other properties in the area. 

'The snake remains at large and the caravan has been eradicated.' 

'Good news though, she does not own further caravans at this location.'
