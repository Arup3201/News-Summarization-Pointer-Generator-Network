A sorority at University of Central Florida has been suspended indefinitely in the aftermath of a hazing scandal involving forced binge drinking.

Three members of the Chi Omega Greek organization on campus resigned after two freshman pledges came forward with allegations of hazing.

A 19-year-old UCF student identified in a police report as Cheyanne Fannan has revealed to the authorities in a videotaped interview that sisters at Chi Omega forced her to drink rum until she blacked out.

The alleged incident took place on the night of April 4 at an arboretum off campus, and it involved Fannan and another 19-year-old freshman identified as Carlee Stetson.

‘I had too much alcohol in my system that I just kind of went numb,’ Fannan told police after the ordeal. ‘I've never blacked out before,’ the station ClickOrlando reported.

The teenager, from Tampa Bay, recounted how at around 10pm on April 4, three sorority sisters picked her up along with Stetson, blindfolded them and led the two girl sto a wooded area near the Orlando college campus.

The two 19-year-olds were then allegedly ordered to tilt their heads back and open their mouths to allow the sisters to pour Dragon Berry Bacardi rum down their throats.

The new Chi Omega members were later instructed to finish the entire bottle while blind-folded.

Once Fannan and Stetson consumed all the alcohol, they were allegedly taken to a campus parking lot and abandoned there without any means to get home.

Ms Fannan recalled said that she was so inebriated she could not stand on her own and had to be carried by Stetson and her boyfriend, who came to their aid.

Fannan also suffered scrapes to her hand after she fell over while wandering around the parking lot in a drunken stupor.

The teenagers were allegedly instructed by the sorority sisters to lie to police about the incident, but they came forward with the information about the suspected hazing.

However, both pledges declined to prosecute the Chi Omega sisters, which means that they will not face criminal charges.

The sorority girls, identified in the police report obtained by Orlando Sentinel as Maribeth Snyder, 20; Lauren Hartwell, 19; and Marae Watkins-Creel, 22, have since resigned from Chi Omega.

The university has reserved the right to discipline the former sisters and punish the sorority for breaking UCF’s hazing, alcohol and disruptive conduct rules.
