The Grillo sisters may yet face civil action from Charles Saatchi as he tries to recover the £685,000 he claims they were not authorised to spend on his credit card.

But Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo are considering their own legal action according to their family – they plan to sue Nigella Lawson and Mr Saatchi for defamation and damage to their reputation, following their acquittal at Isleworth Crown Court.

Their father, Michele Grillo, told The Mail on Sunday that his family was furious at the way the sisters’ names had been tarnished by their former employers.

Speaking from his home in southern Italy, he said: ‘We are now going to see if we can sue them for damages for what they put Elisabetta and Francesca through.

The girls have been brought up well, have never done anything wrong and were innocent.

Michele Grillo says that his family is furious at the way that his daughters names have been tarnished by the case

‘The lawyers were right when they said they were just lambs caught in the middle of a fight between two wolves.’

He said the case had been ‘really tough’ on  both his daughters and accused  Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson of making his children scapegoats  in their marital battle.

He said: ‘I’d love to have five minutes with them so I can make them see sense. They used my own daughters for their own personal battles.

As for Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi, all I will say is that one is just a filthy drug user and the other is a cruel b*****d.’

Despite being cleared of all criminal charges, the two former personal assistants could still be sued by Mr Saatchi should he decide to pursue a civil lawsuit  to reclaim the ‘misappropriated funds’.

An outstanding civil claim, submitted in July last year, demands that the pair pay back  the money spent on taxis and personal items, as well as return the goods bought using Mr Saatchi’s credit card.

Should Mr Saatchi decide to pursue the case, the public could see the whole saga played out again.Mr Saatchi’s lawyers could not be reached for comment.
