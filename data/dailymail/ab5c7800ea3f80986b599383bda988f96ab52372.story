The best of British design has been chronicled in a list with London's iconic Tube map and the E-type Jaguar among the country's most quintessential exports. 

Royal Mail's First Class stamp and a God Save the Queen poster were also included in the list put together by Reader's Digest. 

One less conventional entry is the Big Brother logo, designed to illustrate the all seeing eye described in George Orwell's 1984 and made famous by Channel 4 in 2002. 

Going places: London's iconic Tube map was ranked as one of Britain's most quintessential exports

Among items on the list of the best British designs is the E-type Jaguar designed in 1961 by Malcolm Sayer 

The controversial Join the ATS poster (left) was withdrawn from circulation after being deemed unsuitable by politicians. The God Save the Queen Sex Pistols album cover (right) also made the list 

It is the most recent of the images on the list, with Harry Beck's tube map the oldest at 83. 

Designed in 1931, the basis of the map is still used by Transport for London. 

Unlike those before it, Beck's map disregarded the distance between stations and based the diagram on those he drew for his job as an electrical draughtsman. 

Also on the list is a controversial poster advertising for the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1941. 

The poster was an attempt to spruce up the previously dull propaganda used by the ATS, but was criticised for its use of a 'blonde bombshell'. 

It was withdrawn from circulation after being deemed unsuitable by Parliament. 

An image of The Queen features twice on the list, in a Sex Pistols poster for God Save the Queen, and in a more-refined profile on the Royal Mail's First Class Stamp. 

The E-type jag and Kodak's 1968 Instamatic camera also made the list. 

Daniel Eatock's Big Brother eye is the most recent entry, made recognisable in 2001. 

Of the logo, Reader's Digest writes: 'Whatever you think of the programme, the Big Brother logo stays lodged in the brain, symbolising the all-seeing Orwellian eye but in this case staring back at the viewer.'
