Our columnist predicted Barcelona's fawning over Luis Suarez in his comment piece in Tuesday's Daily Mail

Barcelona's courting of the shamed Luis Suarez stepped up a notch as their sporting director publicly backed the striker following his apology for biting Giorgio Chiellini.

Questions persisted about the Uruguayan when the club were unveiling new signing Ivan Rakitic on Tuesday, with Andoni Zubizarreta unable to resist commenting.

'Suarez had the honour to come out and apologise for his actions and now it's time for him to begin the recovery process,' Zubizarreta said at the Nou Camp.

VIDEO Barca in for Suarez

The Catalans are currently undergoing a minor rebuild after a year of stagnation under Gerardo Martino which eventually saw him sacked, with Suarez seemingly topping the list.

Luis Enrique has been handed funds to sign Ivan Rakitic from Sevilla for £14million and Real Sociedad's Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.

Suarez's future at Anfield looks more than uncertain as talk surrounding Liverpool's stance on his latest indiscretion continues and whether it could prove a stumbling block for Barcelona.

But, on the day he was unveiled, new man Rakitic also had his say.

'To have the character and strength to apologise in front of the world shows what a noble person he is,' the Croatian added.

Upon hearing Suarez's apology, former England international Gary Lineker was left in no doubt that it was designed to engineer a move to Catalonia. 

'I hear that Barca insisted on apology if transfer is to proceed,' the BBC anchor tweeted on Monday.

After initially denying responsibility for his actions, claiming he had merely collided with the Italian defender, Suarez finally apologised to Chiellini on Monday.

'After several days of being home with my family, I have had the opportunity to regain my calm and reflect about the reality of what occurred during the Italy-Uruguay match on June 24, 2014.

'Independent from the fallout and the contradicting declarations that have surfaced during these past days, all of which have been without the intention of interfering with the good performance of my national team, the truth is that my colleague Giorgio Chillieni suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me.

'For this: - I deeply regret what occurred.

'I apologise to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never be another incident like.'
