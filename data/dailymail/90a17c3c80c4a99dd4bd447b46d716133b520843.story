The baby girl cut from her mother's stomach by a Colorado woman was not born alive, as it is revealed the suspect faces more than 100 years in prison after being charged with attempted murder.

Investigators found no trauma or injuries to the baby girl, whose mother was seven months pregnant, according to Boulder County Coroner Emma Hall.

Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday.

Hall said there was no evidence the unborn child survived outside of victim Michelle Wilkins' womb.

Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said his office would not seek a murder charge against Lane, according to KTLA.

Under Colorado law, a person can be charged with murdering a baby only if there is evidence the baby was alive outside of the mother's body.

'At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb,' said Hall.

'Therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth.

'No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body. Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete.'

Garnett said final results on the cause of death will take six to eight weeks, and he said the coroner's conclusion that it was not a live birth precluded the filing of murder charges.

Lane was also charged with two counts each of first and second-degree assault.

She faces eight criminal counts and up to 48 years in prison if convicted of first-degree attempted murder, and up to 32 years on each of the other charges of assault and unlawful termination of pregnancy.

Wilkins, 26, was released from hospital on Wednesday, according to Times-Call.

Her family said they are aware of the charges that were announced by the district attorney's office in a statement on Friday. 

Following her release from the hospital, they said she is taking the first tentative steps in a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation.

They also said Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. 

Wilkins had moved to Colorado and just started a job teaching pottery classes.

On March 18, she answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes in a suburban neighborhood of Longmont, about 30 miles from Denver.

She was glassed in the neck and then attacked with a small knife in the basement, allegedly by Dynel Lane.

The suspect then fled with the baby, who was found by Lane's husband, taking her last breath's in the bathtub.

Lane reportedly told her husband that she had suffered a miscarriage and he took her to hospital with the baby.

The accused attacker told hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed.

Family Statement

March 25, 2015

Today marks a week since the brutal attack that nearly cost Michelle her life and ended that of her soon to be born baby Aurora. 

She is now out of the hospital in a safe location and accompanied by her partner Dan, is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. 

She is surrounded by friends and family and wishes to express her deep gratitude for all the expressions of love, kindness, and spiritual solidarity she has received from both the Longmont community and from around the world. 

Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving.

We cannot predict what lies ahead for Michelle. We have no guidebook on how to navigate this crisis, or a checklist on what to do next. We wish there were. 

What we can say is that we have all been deeply moved by the many people who have reached out to Michelle and her partner to share their own personal stories of tragedies they’ve endured and how they managed to first just survive and then eventually start to heal. 

That alone has given us the strength to get up and face each day. You’ve touched our hearts and souls and we thank you so much.

For the many members of the media who have reached out to us, we thank you for your continuing interest in Michelle’s well being and the civility that has marked almost all the reporting. 

We hope you understand our continuing desire for privacy as we try and regroup, pull our lives together, and focus on Michelle’s well-being and recovery. 

There may be a time in the future where she chooses to share her story, but now is not the moment.

Around 2.30pm, Miss Wilkins managed to make a 911 call as she lay bleeding out on the basement floor.

During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.'

The police officers who found her, Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, described finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock.

'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — "Help me! Help me!"' Sawyer told KTLA this weekend.

He described finding her covered from head to toe in blood.

'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said.

Piotrowski believed that Miss Wilkins was the one who 'saved her own life.'

'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself.

The case has revived the highly charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. 

Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. 

State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. 

Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law.

A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for May 5 and Lane remains held in jail on a $2million bond.
