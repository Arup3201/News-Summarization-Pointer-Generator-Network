He might be celebrating his first birthday today but when it comes to style, Prince George has the sort of selling power that far outstrips his years with even his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, left trailing in his wake.

Dubbed 'the world's most influential toddler' by Forbes magazine, anything the infant royal wears sells out instantly as mothers rush to add a shot of royal style to their children's wardrobes.

With a mother famous for her sartorial nous, Prince George was always going to have a stylish wardrobe. But what few could have imagined is just how quickly the 'George Effect' would kick in.

In the event, it took less than 48 hours with the white receiving blanket in which he was wrapped as he was carried from the Lindo Wing selling out almost instantly.

Costing £44.95 and made by Aden + Anais, a US label run by an Australian, more than 7000 Jungle Jam swaddling wraps were sold in the first nine days of George's life, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent.

And so it has continued, with the latest to benefit from the George effect being Petit Bateau, the French brand behind the striped sailcloth dungarees worn by the third in line to the throne for the birthday portrait released on Sunday.

Costing just £27.50, the all-in-one sold out within hours of the photograph's publication with a £31.50 red version also selling well - much to the delight of CEO Patrick Pergament.

'Petit Bateau is extremely honoured that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose our brand to dress Prince George for this official photo,' he told MailOnline. 

Starting early: Aden + Anais sold more than 7,000 white receiving blankets in the first nine days of George's life after the baby was carried from the Lindo Wing in one

'We are surprised and delighted and we could not imagine a better ambassador than this little boy full of life. We take this opportunity to wish him a very happy birthday.'

And Pergament isn't the only CEO to have been left rubbing his hands in glee following a royal appearance. Designer Rachel Riley, almost unheard of until Prince George wore her sailboat smocked dungarees for a 'crawl-about' in New Zealand, says that the George Effect has transformed her business.

'He is such a high profile baby and he’s brought lots of attention and excitement to the brand,' the London-based designer said in an interview with Forbes magazine.

'It’s been phenomenal for the business to have Prince George wearing pieces from the collection. Personally, as a British citizen, if there’s one child I’d want to dress it’s the heir to the throne.  I’m absolutely thrilled.'

Others to 
benefit include little known Belgian label, Les Petit Abeilles whose 
white romper suit emblazoned with sailboats was worn as George arrived 
in Australia, and Spain's Neck & Neck whose website crashed after 
the baby royal was photographed in its pinstriped dungarees during a day
 out at the polo.

'Prince
 George wore the sailboat romper by Les Petites Abeilles on two 
occasions, at the Dukes arrival in New Zealand (with a white cardigan) 
and in Australia,' remembers Les Petit Abeilles founder, Désirée von Hohenlohe.

'It was a great surprise and honour to see it worn by Prince George. We had a significant increase in sales afterwards and people emailed us from all over the world to order the romper.'

And it isn't just Les Petit Abeilles sales figures that have felt the Prince George effect. As Ms von Hohenlohe explains, the increased scrutiny has resulted in a makeover for the business itself.,

'We had the idea of developing our business by launching a web shop,' she explains. 'With all the publicity we received, we had to speed up setting the shop up.

'It also motivates us for our future projects. Now there are big expectations and people are following what we are doing. A fashion magazine even contacted us to photo shoot of our autumn winter collection; this has been very encouraging for us.'

Most of 
all though, Ms von Hohenlohe says she is thrilled by the simple fact 
that the Duchess of Cambridge liked her work enough to buy it for her 
baby son.

'We
 are of course thrilled with such an honour and we have great admiration
 for the royals,' she beams. 'The fact that they liked our sailboat 
romper means a lot to us, regardless of whether the current sailboat 
romper frenzy continue or not.

'We
 will always remember the  moment we saw the little Prince wearing our 
romper, and the excitement we felt. We feel great about the fact that 
Les Petites Abeilles can dress little boys all over the world like 
little Princes.'

And dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog, What Prince George Wore, dedicated to all things baby style.

The blog even has a
 sister site in the shape of What Kate Wore - a website devoted to the 
Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe - although Prince William is yet to find
 similar favour with the fashion set.

But
 while the Duchess of Cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out
 whatever she wears, even she cannot compete with her son when it comes 
to sheer selling power.

From
 £44.95 swaddling wraps to sailcloth dungarees, the George effect shows 
no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear 
designers contemplating another decade of buoyant sales to come.
