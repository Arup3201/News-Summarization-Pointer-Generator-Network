A family claim they were held hostage in their own home by an angry fox that jumped in through an open window then paced outside for hours.

Philip and Christine Tappin were visiting their daughter's home on Canvey Island, Essex, when Mr Tappin heard his granddaughter Darcy, 2, screaming from another room.

When the 52-year-old ran to see what was wrong he was shocked to find that a fox had come in through the downstairs window.

Terrified: Philip Tappin, his wife Christine and their two-year-old granddaughter Darcy (pictured) were trapped in their house for more than four hours by a fox that refused to leave the home on Canvey Island, Essex

Aggressive: The fox, pictured pacing outside, jumped into the property through an open downstairs window. Mr Tappin only knew that it was inside after he heard his granddaughter screaming from another room

The animal quickly jumped back outside, where it paced for more than four hours - trapping the terrified family indoors.

Mr Tappin, who said that he feared the fox might bite him, said that the animal reacted aggressively when he tried to scare it - walking towards him rather than backing away.  

He said: 'My granddaughter could have been bitten.

'I wouldn't leave a puppy or a dog I trusted with my granddaughter. You don't expect there to be a fox in the house.

'It held me prisoner in my own property. I went out to try to scare it away with water - it just came towards me.

'My wife, Christine, even threw a pan of water at it. She is terrified. 

Trapped: Mr Tappin, who works at Tilbury docks, was unable to go to work while he tried to scare away the fox, pictured outside. He tried to chase it away, and splashed it with water, but the animal refused to leave

'I couldn't get any closer than four feet to it. What happens if it bites me? What happens if it does something else? 

'The police told me you can't hurt an animal and I told them I don't want it to invade my property.

'Canvey people have just about had enough of these foxes.'

Mr Tappin called Castle Point Council, the RSPCA and Essex Police for help with the fox. 

The animal paced around his daughter's home between noon and 4.30pm on Thursday, when an RSPCA inspector came to remove it.

Removed: The fox circled Mr Tappin's daughter's house for more than four hours - until an RSPCA investigator came to sedate the animal and take it away. Mr Tappin said he thought the animal might have been sick

Mr Tappin said that he thought the  fox may have been ill as it appeared 'mangy' and was being sick just before the inspector arrived.

Mr Tappin, who works at Tilbury Docks, was unable to go to work while he tried to sort the problem.

He believes the foxes are being attracted by people having to store rubbish and recycling in their gardens.

He added: 'Nobody wanted anything to do with the foxes, but there is a plague of them on Canvey at the moment.'
