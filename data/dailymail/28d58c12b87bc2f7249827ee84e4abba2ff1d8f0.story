Managers have a habit of talking up the opposition, especially after they have won. It’s not a particularly subtle way of amplifying your own team’s qualities.

Clearly if the side you have beaten are excellent, then that only magnifies your own achievement.

So when Cesare Prandelli praised England at the end his 2-1 win over them on Sunday night, the warm words had to be filtered through a more cynical prism. And yet, even given that proviso, it is worth recording what he said.

Raising their game: Roy Hodgson has brought a better brand of football to the England team

‘We know England have changed a lot in the last few years,’ said Prandelli.

‘They used to play with long balls and headers. Now England are very good playing in triangles and one on one. They really have one the strongest attacks in the World Cup.

'I’ve been really consistent in what I’ve been saying: we played against a great team.’

Perhaps he was ladling it on a little by the end. England are not a great side but they do have the potential to be a good one. It is Prandelli’s line about England playing in triangles that perhaps offers the most encouragement.

It wasn’t just about the speed of England on Saturday night, which, should they progress, will surely worry any side they face. They actually moved the ball nicely at times, engineering their way out of tight spaces with neat passing.

It’s not the first time England have done it.

Foreign coaches once were similarly complementary about the improvements that Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle had made to England’s style but progressive football was somehow abandoned once the expensive foreign imports took over the reins of management.

It seems it takes an English coach to believe English players can actually play a little: Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello never seemed to trust them to do so.

Too often at World Cups England have been like the unwanted drunken guest, stumbling over tables and embarrassing everyone with their inappropriate aggression.

On Saturday, in a World Cup that has sparkled so far, England behaved like part of the in-crowd at the party, entertaining and impressing.

True, they lost, a not inconsiderable draw back. But most would take defeat in this manner over the 0-0 abject draw with Algeria in Cape Town in 2010; or the laboured victories over Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago in 2006.

Who would have known that Roy Hodgson had been repressing these attacking instincts? Like a suburban bank manager who indulges a secret passion for clubbing at the weekends, he indulged every populist call in deploying Raheem Sterling from the start, refusing to kowtow to Wayne Rooney and in bringing on Ross Barkley.

A few Liverpool fans might be bemused by the manager England have employed. He would argue that he didn’t have these players at Liverpool.

Pride: Even in defeat England played well and will progress if they perform to that level in the next two games

Yet on Saturday night, England seemed to play with freedom, as though they embracing the challenge rather enduring it.

Not that the game was without issues. Ultimately England’s failure to pick up Claudio Marchisio for Italy’s first goal was inexplicable in a team managed by Hodgson, who is so meticulous on his team shape and player responsibilities.

Good though Andrea Pirlo’s dummy was, Marchisio had a free strike. It was a goal that was easily prevented. And Leighton Baines won’t relish the re-runs of Antonio Candreva turning him the wrong way to deliver the deep, looping cross for Mario Balotelli to score.

And then there is Rooney. Roy Hodgson defended him on Saturday night and it is true that for long periods he performed in his required role as well as delivering a superb cross for Daniel Sturridge’s goal.

‘We wanted to get Raheem Sterling around Andrea Pirlo because of his agility and of course that meat moving Wayne Rooney and I thought that worked well,’ said Hodgson.

‘He set up the goal for us, he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre.

'There’s always going to be one player who there’s a big debate around but I think it’s very harsh to criticise Rooney’s performance today because for me he played well.’

Passing success: Hodgson's decision to get England playing a more dynamic game will produce results

Down but not out: Rooney was disappointing but he offers enough to be picked against Uruguay

That said, Sturridge, Welbeck and Sterling played better. The debate for Uruguay now boils down to whether Rooney is better than Adam Lallana? As an attacking threat he is and as such he starts in a game England must win.

However, it might be argued that Lallana would have have dealt with full back Matteo Darmian better and would have had the energy to offer greater protection to Baines. Significantly, Hodgson felt the need to switch Welbeck to the left at half time, to curtail the Italian right back – though he still popped up providing the pass for Candreva’s cross and Balotelli’s goal.

And then there is the small matter of defeat. Under Eriksson and Capello England often looked awful; but they didn’t lose in World Cup group stages, though Eriksson did in his first game in Euro 2004 to France.

England could be figuratively packing their bags on Thursday, slipping out of the party before the real dancing begins, returning home after briefly dazzling. It doesn’t feel like that, however.

Not since 1998 and the honourable exit against Argentina on penalties has defeat felt this good. The national mood won’t feel quite so generous if the result is the same on Thursday; but if the performance is repeated, there is little chance that it will be.
