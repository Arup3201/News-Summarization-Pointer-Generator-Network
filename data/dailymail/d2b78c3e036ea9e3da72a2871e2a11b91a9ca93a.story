A mother-of-one has made a landmark vow on her 40th birthday to not undergo any more surgery, after 82 operations to correct a rare facial deformity.

Born with a condition that causes large masses of swollen blood vessels to grow under her skin, Fiona Grigg, 40, has endured over 80 major operations to re-build her face.

But Fiona, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, has determinedly led as normal a life as possible, finding love and giving birth to a beautiful daughter

Finally this year, after a lifetime of juggling everyday life with hospital appointments, Fiona is celebrating the end of her surgery as she turns 40.

Born with a rare facial deformity, Fiona Grigg, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed just days after birth with cavernous haemangioma

Fiona was born with china doll features and perfectly clear skin until a tiny pink mark appeared on her cheek a few hours later.

Doctors discovered she had a rare condition called cavernous haemangioma which causes blood vessels under the skin to swell. 

Within weeks the small mark had swollen into a huge, hard red mass filled with blood that distorted Fiona’s face.

Her lips burst open, she couldn’t open her right eye and she could barely breathe as the mass spread across her face, around her head and down into her throat.

Her condition meant that she suffered severe headaches and struggled to eat. Even a slight knock to her face would cause it to haemorrhage

Doctors feared Fiona wouldn't survive and at six weeks old her parents chose to have her christened and read her last rights.

However she defied the odds and after 14 months in hospital Fiona was sent home.

Her condition meant that she suffered severe headaches and struggled to eat. Even a slight knock to her face would cause it to haemorrhage.

People would stop and stare and when she joined a playgroup parents complained she looked too frightening.

At aged four Fiona began having the first of 82 major operations to remove the mass but it had distorted the underlying bone structure, pushing Fiona’s face to one side.

'One of my earliest memories is sitting in my bedroom and licking my baby photos and scratching the face off them. Mum found them all cut up in the fireplace in my room and was devastated.'

Going through puberty was particularly hard and Fiona was bullied at school. Some children even refused to speak to her, believing she was contagious.

As she grew older, Fiona realised she had a choice - she could either hide away, or she could make the best of things.

Fiona made the decision not to let her health problems hold her back. She decided to train to be a nurse.

Now working as a senior health care assistant Fiona says: 'The patients were too wrapped up in their own problems to bother about me. At least I was doing something worthwhile.'

As well as her job, Fiona enjoyed an active social life, often going out with friends.

'Being born with a facial deformity has taught me things in life that I would never have known otherwise. No
 matter what anyone else thinks I know I’ve been very lucky.’

One night when out at a nightclub with her cousin she met her future husband Alastair, now 41.

'He recognised me from the local paper and said he thought I was very brave.

'We got on really well but I assumed he was doing it to be kind. After all he could have any girl.'

As their relationship developed Alastair told her: ‘You’re strong, caring and better than any of them. Despite what you’ve been through you’re happy and kind.'

A fairy tale wedding followed and afterwards they tried for a baby. When nothing happened they turned to IVF which failed.

'We decided to book a holiday in Florida and planned to undergo a second round when we returned.

But while swimming with dolphins one kept nudging Fiona’s stomach - and on her return she discovered she was already pregnant.

When Evie-May was born (on New Year's Eve) the couple were thrilled.

As Evie-May got older she knew Fiona looked different. Fiona would just tell her: 'It's cool to have a mum that's unique,' and Evie would tell her friends the same.

Meanwhile after not having surgery for a few years Fiona began suffering from eye infections and cellulitis.

She began undergoing more major surgery during which doctors removed the old silicone prosthesis from her right cheek and rebuilt the area with a rod and soft mesh, in a bid to help reconstruct the area where the tumours had been, leaving a large concave area at the side of her face. 

In all she had eight more excruciating procedures.

'"You look beautiful" Evie-May would smile when she saw me, even though I was bruised and bandaged.'

But finally after a lifetime of surgery and, as she recently celebrated her 40th birthday, she has now vowed enough is enough. 

‘A major chapter has come to an end and I’m finally free. I feel fabulous the way I am.

‘There have been incredible highs and lows because of my deformity. Among other things I was presented with a Champion Child Award for triumph over adversity by Princess Di - which I'd never have experienced otherwise.

'Being born with a facial deformity has taught me things in life that I would never have known otherwise.

‘I’ve got a wonderful job, a husband who loves me and a gorgeous daughter. No matter what anyone else thinks I know I’ve been very lucky.’
