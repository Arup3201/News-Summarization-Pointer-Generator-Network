A jobless man who claimed to have fathered 22 children by 11 women was yesterday spared jail for dealing drugs – after telling a judge he needed to help care for his youngest.

Raymond Hull, 58, who has been married only once and has lived off benefits for a decade, insisted ‘I just love kids’, but admitted he was in contact with only ‘about 12’ of them.

Despite police finding a stash of cannabis and text messages from customers, a judge accepted he was helping to raise child number 22 – seven-month-old Barry – while his partner returned to work.

With ‘considerable hesitation’ the judge went on to impose a suspended sentence.

Afterwards
 Hull – who has a series of convictions dating back four decades – 
defended his unconventional lifestyle, saying he had ‘never been short 
of offers’.

‘I just love kids,’ he said. ‘I don’t regret anything, 
even though I don’t speak to them all. Some of them don’t even know I’m 
their dad.’ And he bragged: ‘I don’t know what it is about me, but I’m 
never short of offers.

‘It’s just my luck that every time I have a one-night stand, the girl ends up getting pregnant.

'I've never had to chase after women. I'm easy going, they are always chasing me.'If it's tidy, you don't knock it back, do you?'

Hull
 claims to have fathered his first child when he was 16, but according 
to local birth records his eldest, John, was born when he was 19. Later 
that year, in 1975, he married John’s mother, Patricia, then just 17, 
and over the next nine years they had four more children – Raymond Jr, 
now 37, Joseph, 36, Adrian, 34, and Rebecca, 29.

‘I only know one or 
two of  their birthdays, but they don’t mind. One of the girls got a 
sister for her birthday one year,’ he recalled yesterday.

The couple
 split up and Hull is listed as the father of three children – Leon, now
 23, Rianna, 22, and Kane, 20 – by his next partner.

Two years ago he
 set up home in the Cumbrian village of Aspatria with a bakery worker 
less than half his age, 26-year-old Emma McNeil, and last year she gave 
birth to a baby boy, Barry. However, when he appeared in court this week
 he claimed to have fathered a total of 22 children.

Explaining how 
he fathered so many children by so many women, he said yesterday: ‘I’ve 
only been married once. I’ve got five kids with one woman; three with 
another; three with another; and three with another. I’ve got two kids 
with one woman and little Barry with Emma.

‘The others were just one each with different women.

'Some of the girls were happy to give the
 relationship a go, others did not want anything to do with me after 
they got pregnant. I still keep in touch with all the women now though. I
 get on better with them now we've split.

'I
 agreed with some of my exes now that if they get married to someone 
else, and another man raises the kid, it is not my kid anymore. I see 14
 of my kids who know I am their dad all the time'.

Hull hasn’t worked for ten years because of a bad back and says 'it must be from running round after all these kids all these years'.

A picture of Hull was once placed on Facebook of him clutching a condom and smiling, and his son Raymond Jr posted: 'You wanna learn how to use them.'

Carlisle Crown Court, where a judge decided to suspend Hull's jail sentence so he could look after his youngest child

He
 claimed to be in debt – but his baby son was playing with an iPad when a
 reporter visited this week. Hull, who also claims to have 19 
grandchildren, was arrested after police raided his terraced home last 
May and discovered cannabis worth £350.

Examination of his mobile 
phone revealed a text message telling a customer there would be a delay 
in supplying drugs due to Barry’s impending birth.

Hull admitted 
using cannabis to help with his own medical problems at Carlisle Crown 
Court, but claimed he only sold to friends to cover costs. However, 
Judge Paul Batty QC dismissed Hull’s claims as a ‘cock and bull story’. 
Hull then abandoned his story, choosing not to give evidence in support 
of it.

In mitigation, Anthony Wilson said Hull had ‘a number of 
medicinal conditions’ including breathing problems, back pains and 
frequent chest infections which would make any time in prison difficult.

He suggested that a suspended sentence could be imposed so that Hull 
could stay at home and look after the baby while his partner went back 
to work.

Judge Batty imposed an 18-month sentence, suspended for two 
years. He also put Hull under a night-time curfew for the next six 
months and ordered him pay £200 which will be taken out of his benefits.

Hull had 31 previous convictions spread over 40 years, but none was for drug dealing.
