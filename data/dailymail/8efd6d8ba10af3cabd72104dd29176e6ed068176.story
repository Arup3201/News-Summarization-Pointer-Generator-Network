China is warning the world to divest itself of American interests as the risk of a default rises with each passing day as the Thursday shutdown deadline draws ever closer.

Through official government news agency Xinhua, the Chinese government Sunday denounced the current state of the U.S. government and it’s finances, advising it would be a good time to start considering a ‘de-Americanised’ world.

‘It is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanised world,’ the Guardian first reported the Chinese news agency said.

Officials in both the American government and abroad are also voicing concerns that the failure to come to an agreement on raising the debt ceiling before Thursday’s deadline would have a grave impact on the world’s economy.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has repeatedly voiced concern that the U.S. government will go broke, having no money to pay bills this Thursday, should an agreement not be reached.

Despite several senior Democratic and Republican Party leaders meeting Sunday in Washington, it does not appear any progress has been made in negotiations.

The Senate needs to hold tough,' Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.’

Those words came as news of talks breaking down even further infuriate Americans, sparking a march Sunday through Washington, D.C. of veterans protesting the closure of several monuments.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) also lamented the lack of progress.

'I was happy to see the Republicans engaged in talks with the president, the House Republicans.

That’s over with. It’s done. They’re not talking anymore,' Reid said.

'I say to my friends on the Republican side of this Senate, time is running out.'

President Barack Obama voiced his exasperation with the situation on his weekly radio address.

‘It doesn't have to be this way. It's not supposed to be this way,’ the president said, adding ‘Manufacturing crises to extract massive concessions isn't how our democracy works, and we have to stop it.’

Referring to Republicans’ unwillingness to discuss anything unless Obamacare is defunded, Mr Obama said that ‘politics is a battle of ideas, but you advance those ideas through elections and legislation - not extortion.’

Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund chief, shared her concerns with NBC’s ‘Meet the press.’

‘If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over,’ she told the program.

‘We would be at risk of tipping, yet again, into recession,’ she added.

Xinhua took further shots and the U.S., despite China being the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt.

‘Such alarming days when the destinies of others are in the hands of a hypocritical nation have to be terminated,’ the news agency ranted.

‘The cyclical stagnation in Washington for a viable bipartisan solution over a federal budget and an approval for raising debt ceiling has again left many nations’ tremendous dollar assets in jeopardy and the international community highly agonised,’ the commentary furthered.

China holds $1.28trillion in U.S. Treasury bonds – an American government default is four days away, unless politicians can make a deal.

Xinhua ended by passing along advice most Americans would likely agree with - 'it is suggested that the beltway politicians first begin with ending the pernicious impasse.'
