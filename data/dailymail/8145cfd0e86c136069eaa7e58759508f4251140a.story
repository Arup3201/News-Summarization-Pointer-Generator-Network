Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has admitted she previously had a 'big problem' with alcohol - and has revealed that since she went teetotal a fortnight ago she has lost 10lbs.

The Ultimo founder previously revealed that she drank up to a bottle of wine a day during her 2012 marriage break-up, which ended up costing her £24 million. 

Ms Mone, 43, gave up alcohol at the start of the New Year and today announced on Twitter she has already lost more than half a stone - but not all of her fans thought it was healthy to lose so much weight in such a short time.

Ms Mone shared this picture of her on holiday with her 861,000 followers on Twitter with the caption: '11 days no booze,7Ib off&on my way to best body ever!6Ib to go till I'm the size of this picture.Are u doing well?'

After sharing various pictures of herself looking healthy and slim, she today told her 861,000 followers on Twitter she is aware she is looking good. 

'Yes I had BIG problem with booze 15 days off, lost 10Ib, body like a rock. Skin&eyes crystal clear, not showing off, I look like an Ultimo model,' she tweeted.

She also revealed since she went teetotal a fortnight ago, she has lost 10lbs

Some of her followers were shocked by the announcement. 

Angela McDermott wrote: 'You must have been doing some drinking to lose that much weight', while former BBC Apprentice candidate Simon Smith said: 'I haven't had an alcoholic drink for almost three years. Best decision I ever made for my own wellbeing #sober'.

But Maureen Kerr added: 'As much as I admire you & your achievements 10lb weight loss is not healthy within a short period of time. #sobriety'

Last year Ms Mone admitted she was 'amazed' she had not suffered a nervous breakdown over the traumatic experiences she had faced in the last few years.

Ms Mone, whose autobiography Fight To The Top is due out in March, has sold the lion share of the Ultimo underwear company that she founded with her now ex husband Michael. 

She created the company with the help of the Princes Trust after failing to find a bra that gave her the support she needed.

Ms Mone, a self-confessed workaholic who claims to need only four house of sleep a night, recently announced that instead of putting her feet up she is planning to pursue more TV work, on top of buying out her partners in her UTan beauty company.

She also plans to buy a house in Los Angeles to add to her homes in London and Scotland.

The businesswoman, who has not only gone through a marriage break-up and launched a major international brand from nothing but has undergone skin cancer treatment, says Fight to the Top will cover the break-down of her marriage.

She shared this picture last week with the caption: 'Smashed it!Not that long ago I couldn't run 200yards without getting out of breath.Healthy mind&body =control in Biz' 

Mr Mone has set up a rival lingerie firm, with Ultimo's former chief designer, Samantha Bunn.

The Mones split in Christmas 2011, reportedly over Mr Mone's relationship with Ms Bunn.

The couple had been married for 19 years and have three children.

Mone grew up in relative poverty in Glasgow before finding work as a model.

After running a sales and marketing team for the Labatt's brewing company, she made the decision to create a range of support bras after wearing an uncomfortable bra during a dinner party.
