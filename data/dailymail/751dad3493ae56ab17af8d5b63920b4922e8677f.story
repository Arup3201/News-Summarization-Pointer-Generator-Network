Trying to come up with a unique baby name? Consider looking at the least popular names in the United States for inspiration.

The monikers at the bottom of the Social Security Administration's 2013 U.S. popularity list have been given to just five newborns in the entire nation - and they range from creative and appealing to downright crazy.

'Down there, among the wacky inventions or truly terrible kree8tiv spelling variations, are dozens of intriguing choices that you won’t encounter coming and going,' writes Pamela Redmond Satran in a Nameberry article. 

What should we call you? According to naming site Nameberry, people searching for unique monikers should look at the least popular names on the Social Security Administration's popularity list

There are less popular names (given to fewer than five babies), but the SSA doesn't list them due to privacy concerns. 

Some of our favorite unpopular names include Letitia, Hyacinth, Calixta, and Eulalie for girls, and Baird, Inigo, Chaplin, and Christo for boys.

On the crazier side are Chardonnay, Fancy, Icy, and Trejure for girls, and Furious, Danger, Albino, and Messer for boys.

'Most of these rare names are “creative” spelling variations of popular names (Izebella and Jacub), inventions like Jayly or Axtin, or international names largely unknown in the US,' says Ms Satran.

In 2013, the top boys' names were Noah, Liam, Jacob, Mason, and William.

The most popular names for girls were Sophia, Emma, Olivia, Isabella, and Ava.
