Off target: Failed bank boss Sir Fred Goodwin

A damning report into how Royal Bank of Scotland was brought to its knees by a £50billion gamble triggered outrage yesterday after former boss Sir Fred Goodwin escaped any punishment.

The long-awaited 450-page report into the bank’s cataclysmic collapse lays bare a catalogue of management incompetence, regulatory failings and disastrous takeover deals which led to the bank’s implosion in 2008.

‘Fred the Shred’ and his colleagues were allowed to run riot because of a ‘light touch’ regulatory regime championed by Labour ministers including current Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, found the report by the Financial Services Authority.

The bank was brought to its knees by ‘multiple poor decisions’ and a huge gamble when RBS – as part of a consortium – bought Dutch bank ABN Amro for £50billion in 2007.

Despite his pivotal role in the downfall of RBS, Sir Fred, 53, continues to enjoy his gold-plated lifestyle and his knighthood, funded by a £342,500 a year pension.

He has not been penalised or prosecuted in any way, despite steering the bank to the brink of collapse.

It only survived because of a £45billion bailout by the taxpayer, who still own 83 per cent of the bank. There are fears they may never get all their money back.

In the regulator’s report:

■ Politicians, including Ed Balls and the former Prime Minister Tony Blair, are lambasted for urging the regulator to leave RBS and other banks alone. It says there was political pressures for a ‘light-touch regulatory regime', despite the banking industry having such a vital role in society and the economy;

■ It is revealed that a year before RBS’s collapse in October 2008, just ‘4.5 people’ at the FSA were in charge of regulating the bank, which the regulator now admits was ‘severely deficient’;

■ It also says that ‘Sir Fred’s ‘robust and assertive’ management style was flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003;

■ There are just 13 mentions of Sir Fred’s name in the report, although the FSA insisted yesterday his lawyers had not significantly changed its findings after being given the right to examine them before publication;

■ It is revealed that at one point, there was just one person responsible for the regulation of RBS’s and Barclays’ investment banking activities, a stance blamed on Labour’s political appetite for minimal regulation;

■ It says that when RBS bought the Dutch bank, ABN Amro, its research into the deal in 2007 which proved to be disastrous amounted to just ‘two lever arch folders and a CD’;

■ Sir Fred’s affair with a colleague, which the married father-of-two tried desperately to keep private, was ‘irrelevant to the story of RBS’s failure’, according to the FSA.

Sir Fred is unemployed, but has such a super-size pension that he never needs to work again.

Lord Oakeshott, the leading LibDem peer, said: ‘Royal Bank of Scotland was a monster – too big to control and to fail, driven by greed and ruled by a tyrant.

‘Reckless train and car drivers go to prison, but Sir Fred goes to the golf course.’

Implications: The FSA report alludes to Sir Fred's infamously aggressive management style, saying his 'perceived dominance' created a risk

To add to the fury of taxpayers, the disgraced Scottish banker also took out a £2.8million tax-free lump sum from his pension before he started receiving it.

When Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, was asked by the Daily Mail yesterday if he thought that it was ‘fair’ that Sir Fred has escaped, he replied: ‘No’. He said: ‘Ordinary people… have a right to be absolutely furious.’

The report says there were a number of reasons behind the failure of RBS, which was a relatively small, prudently managed bank before Sir Fred joined.

One of the biggest problems was its ‘over-reliance on risky short-term wholesale funding’, which was unsustainable when the credit crunch killed it off.

The former Chancellor, Alistair Darling, wrote in his recent autobiography that RBS was just a few hours from collapse when the Government stepped in. RBS also rushed into buying ABN Amro despite knowing little about it. It discovered problems only after it had paid the bill.

The report says: ‘The decision to make a bid of this scale on the basis of limited due diligence entailed a degree of risk-taking that can reasonably be criticised as a gamble.’

 

It adds: ‘Many will find this conclusion [that no director will face sanctions] difficult to accept. Surely someone can and should be held responsible.’

It also alludes to Sir Fred’s infamously aggressive management style, saying his ‘perceived dominance’ created a risk.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was taking legal advice to see if there is any way Sir Fred and other ex-directors could be penalised, such as being disqualified from company directorships.

Roger Lawson, of the Share Soc, which represents individual shareholders, said: ‘The legal framework is totally inadequate. Directors can be totally incompetent and yet still escape any penalty.

‘The shareholders have seen their savings destroyed.’

RBS shares were worth more than £6 in 2007 compared to 20.55p now.

Senior Labour politicians including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls were yesterday blamed for their role in the near-collapse of RBS.

The Financial Services Authority report reveals how it had come under ‘sustained’ political pressure from the previous Government to spare the City from regulation in the run-up to the banking crisis.

The body took the extraordinary step of naming three Labour politicians – former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as well as Mr Balls.

The FSA highlighted a series of speeches and comments by the trio warning that any attempt to tighten the rules would have prompted complaints of ‘heavy-handedness’.

The watchdog concluded that deficiencies in management, governance and culture were responsible for dragging RBS to the brink of collapse in 2008.

The FSA admitted that its own supervision was ‘flawed’, but it said it had come under sustained pressure to protect the City’s status as a financial powerhouse.

Revelations: The report also cited how the then FSA chairman wrote to Mr Blair (pictured)

The report is an indictment of Labour’s 
role in the crisis. Mr Brown and right-hand man Mr Balls have been 
criticised for taking responsibility for bank regulation from the Bank 
of England and handing it to the FSA in 1997.

The report points to a speech made in 2006 by Mr Balls when he was Treasury Secretary in which he said ‘nothing should be done to put at risk a light-touch, risk-based regulatory regime’.

The FSA said that, in this context, it was ‘almost certain’ the FSA would have been accused of pursuing a ‘heavy-handed, gold-plating approach which would harm London’s competitiveness’ if it had argued for the tighter banking rules that were put in place after the crisis.

The report adds that it responded to the pressure by reassuring Labour politicians that it only employed a handful of staff to supervise major banks.

It goes on to cite how then FSA chairman Sir Callum McCarthy wrote to Mr Blair assuring him that the FSA ‘applied to the supervision of its largest banks only a fraction of the resource applied by U.S. regulators to banks of equivalent size and importance’.

Prime Minister David Cameron said yesterday that the report was evidence that ‘Labour were to blame for the appalling regulation of RBS’.

Tory Party deputy chairman Michael Fallon said: ‘The report exposes how Labour share the blame for the regulatory failures that led to the biggest bank bailout in history.

‘You wouldn’t bring back Fred Goodwin to sort out the banks, so why would you bring back Ed Balls to sort out the economy?’
