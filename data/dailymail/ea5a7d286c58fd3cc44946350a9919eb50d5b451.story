Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore (pictured) targeted Father Gino Sacchetti because he encouraged residents to oppose the local mafia in Palermo

A brave anti Mafia priest has spoken of how he was targeted by an on-the-run Mob Godfather found hiding in a British suburb after 19 years.

Former prison chaplin Father Gino Sacchetti was intimidated by members of the crime family run by Domenico Rancadore, 64, who was arrested in his flip flops at the home he shares with his wife and daughter.

Fearless Fr Sacchetti, 75, stood up to the terrifying mobsters as they tried to shut him up in his campaign against the so called Costra Nostra 'men of honour' despite having a dead lamb nailed to his front door, his car firebombed and bullets sent to him in the post.

A note sent with the bullets read: 'The first is for your heart, the second for your head, the third for the coup de grace. This is your final warning.'

The softly spoken priest was based in the Mafia’s island heartland of Sicily for 20 years between 1986 and 2006 and spoke out against organised crime encouraging locals to turn their back on them and not be intimidated.

Fr Sacchetti also angered mob bosses by refusing to sell up prime land which they wanted to use for a luxury development and were further outraged when he said he would instead open a shelter for drug addicts on the outskirts of Palermo - the heartland of Rancadore and his henchmen.

Father-of-two Rancadore is said by Italian police to be the boss of the area around the suburbs of Caccamo and Trabia and their paths first crossed in the late 1980’s when the mobster was held in custody at the local prison where Fr Sacchetti was chaplain.

Fr Sacchetti said: 'I knew Rancadore was involved in the threats against me - he sent two local brothers to threaten me. The brothers were arrested but Rancadore was already on the run.

'I suffered a series of threats and intimidation when I was a priest in Sicily.

Fr Sacchetti was working as a prison chaplain in the cathedral city of Palermo in Sicily when his car was firebombed, had bullets posted to him and a dead lamb was nailed to his door

'One period in particular was particularly bad - it was at the time I wanted to set up the shelter.

'My
 car was firebombed and then I had the lamb nailed to my front door at 
the church where I worked. Rancadore was said to be behind it. 

'It was a horrific sight - something that is still clear in my memory, despite it being almost twenty years ago.

'There was a note pinned to it which read "You will end up the same way". It was a clear threat, they wanted to scare me but they were not going to put me off my work.'

Fr Sacchetti, who now lives and works in Verona, was sent the bloodied lamb’s carcass at the same time as the late Pope John Paul II was visiting Sicily and had urged people to rebel against the Mafia.

Mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest Fr Giuseppe Puglisi, 56, who was gunned down by hit men in the run down Brancaccio area of Palermo in 1993 and the pope praised him for standing up to the gangsters. 

Fr Sacchetti said: 'Fr Puglisi was roughly the same age as me when he was murdered.

'The Mafia then turned its attention 
on me because I would not back down to them. Rancadore back then was a 
dangerous and powerful boss who controlled the area with fear.  

'My
 superiors in Palermo were very scared for my welfare but I said I would
 not back down - as a result I was given a police escort around the 
clock for ten years until I left Sicily in 2006.

'It was those officers with families looking after me who were brave. Years ago the Mafia had a rule that children, police and priests were untouchable but then back in the late 80’s and early 90’s things changed. 

'The young son of an informer was dissolved in acid as punishment for him speaking out. Fr Puglisi was murdered and judges and police were targeted.'

Fr Sacchetti added: 'Randacore was involved with very senior figures within the Mafia including Michele Greco who was in charge of Cosa Nostra at the time of the wars between rival clans.

'Rancadore used two brothers Salvatore
 and Giovanni Colletti to threaten me with the lamb, the car bomb and 
the bullets. They wanted me out but I was determined to stay and I did.'

He added: 'I didn’t know 
he had been arrested until you told me but I’m not surprised it has 
taken so long to track him down. These people are very clever.

'Life on the run is horrible. You live in fear of being caught, looking over your shoulder all the time, dreading a knock on the door. It’s not a peaceful or serene life - it’s similar to the life I had under escort for ten years.  

'One thing I will say though is that I have no anger or hatred towards Rancadore or the others that threatened me all those years ago. I have forgiven them and I bear no animosity towards them.

'My message would be to the young people, not to follow in the footsteps of their elders to a life of crime, they should not be afraid. The Devil has only one weapon, fear.
