A teenager who stabbed his father to death and injured his mother in their bedhad been detained indefinitely after it emerged that drugs and violent video games had 'contributed' to his mental illness.

Jordan Ryan from Blackburn, 
Lancashire, who is was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, had been playing a violent video game and also smoked cannabis and taken ‘bubble’ – a street nickname for mephedrone - on the night he fatally 
knifed Neil Ryan, 46, and injured his mother Deborah, 41.

The 19-year-old TA soldier was made subject of an indefinite 
hospital order after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of
diminished responsibility in what the serving judge called the 'saddest
case' in his time at Preston Crown Court.

Jordan fatally stabbed his father Neil in the neck after his parents had allowed him in their bed in a bid to calm him down after he had run away from home complaining about 'voices'.

He then turned the knife on his mother - claiming the ‘voices in his head’ told him do it.

Police were called to the house of horror in Blackburn, Lancshire to find Mr Ryan, a chief steward at a St Paul's Working Men's Club in Blackburn, already dead at the scene.

Mrs Ryan was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital for stab injuries to her breast area but recovered following emergency surgery.

mentally disturbed son as he was ordered to be kept in a secure mental 
health facility.

His not guilty plea to murdering his father was accepted and a charge of attempted murder upon Mrs Ryan was allowed to lie on file after she said she would not testify against her son.

In a statement she said: 'Whilst I grieve for a wonderful husband and soulmate, I also pine for my son who I long to be at home, The pain is heart breaking.’

Mr and Mrs Ryan had been married for 19 years and had a younger son who was not at home at the time of the attack.

In Mrs Ryan’s statement she pledged her ‘unconditional love’ to her son and also said the family had always believed that Jordan was not responsible for his actions during the attack and that the family will continue to support him throughout his recovery.

She added: ‘Neil's loss was devastating enough but Jordan's illness and detainment has been just as traumatic for us all.

‘As a family we need to try and rebuild our lives and continue to support Jordan who is also grieving the loss of his father.’

Although
described as a typical teenager who was not known for violence or 
aggression Jordan, who had been studying a joinery and carpentry course 
at Blackburn, had recently become obsessed with violent video games and 
military shows – even joining the local Territorial Army.

The tragedy occurred last October 
after Jordan spent the evening smoking cannabis and playing a violent 
video game with one of his pals.

The following day he was found walking 
along the road by his grandparents and saying he was ‘hearing voices.’

The
youngster was taken home but could not settle and as his parents 
comforted him in their bedroom they noticed his ‘altering behaviour 
between laughing and tears, shivering and feeling clammy.’

At 5.50am, before he attacked his parents, Ryan dialled 999 and asked for an ambulance.

‘He
informed an operator that someone had broken into the house and that 
his father had been stabbed in the stomach,’ said Mr Lasker.

‘In fact, there had been no violence at all. These details were completely false.’

A police patrol was sent to the house and a search of Ryan confirmed he had no weapons on him.

The youngster then got into the bed of his parents where, the court heard, Mrs Ryan had urged
her husband to try and get some sleep and that her son was lying behind
her husband when Jordan stabbed him in the neck without any prior 
warning.

Mrs Ryan 
immediately dialled emergency services but Mr Lasker told the court that
by the time the 999 call was picked up at 7.50am she too had been 
stabbed.

Jordan, who left 
the house before emergency services arrived, later turned up at his 
grandparents home asking for a change of clothes and a photograph of his
parents which he could ‘take to prison.’

He said, 'I'm sorry grandma, I
didn't want to but they told me to do it. ‘

Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell
QC said: ‘This is one of the saddest cases in the six and a half years 
that I have been sitting in this court room.

‘This
is a shocking case and a terrible tragedy to your family. I'm quite 
satisfied that at the time of the killing, you were suffering from a 
psychotic schizophrenia and this abnormality of mind, from the Crown 
accepts diminished responsibility.

‘The
symptoms became apparent after smoking cannabis and taking bubble. 
Anyone who thinks that these drugs are harmless should reflect on the 
disastrous effect on you, and the viewing of violent video games.

‘It is clear because of your mental state, you remain a danger to the public and the complete mental illness remains severe.

Prosecuting, Jeremy Lasker QC: ‘He had a loving caring relationship with his family and the family unit were happy and stable.’

Defence counsel Peter Wright QC said: "He has a strong and supportive family who recognise his condition and are working with the authorities to help him. They are an unassuming, loving family who are devastated by this terrible family tragedy."

Jordan was made subject to a hospital order under Mental Health Act and cannot be released without the approval of the Secretary of State.

Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘I wish to pay tribute to the dignity and courage and fortified to Deborah and her family, no one can even begin to understand, The compassion and understanding from them that I have seen is remarkable. This family has suffered terribly.’
