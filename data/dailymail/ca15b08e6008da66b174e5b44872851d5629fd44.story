A tiny dog is lucky to be alive after he survived falling off a 250ft cliff while chasing a goat. 

Alfie the Shih Tzu disappeared into bushes before he tumbled off Brean Down onto a beach in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset.

A search operation was launched and coastguards eventually found Alfie unharmed at the foot of the cliff.

Relieved owner Jackie Guest, from Birmingham, said she was amazed her beloved pet survived the fall.

She said: 'I’m so grateful to the coastguard team for their quick response and their help in rescuing Alfie. It was a terrible afternoon and I am so relieved to have him back.'

Eight-month-old Alfie was on a lead but sprinted off after the goat when Jackie, who was visiting the area, put the leash down for a moment.

Dave Welland, Burnham Coastguard Officer, said: 'We were called to reports of a person trying to recover their dog after it went over the edge of Brean Down.

'One team searched the base of the Down while the other searched along the top and the dog was eventually found on the beach at the bottom.

'Incredibly, he just has a few scrapes and bruises. This was a big fall from the edge of the highest point of the Down.

'He was lucky not to have suffered any serious injuries and still had enough energy to snarl at the coastguard officer rescuing him.'
