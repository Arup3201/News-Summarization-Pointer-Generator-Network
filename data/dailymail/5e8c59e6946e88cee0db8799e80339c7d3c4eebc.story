Mario Balotelli will not be leaving Liverpool for Juventus this January, the Italian club's manager Massimiliano Allegri has confirmed.

Reports suggested the Premier League side were willing to offload the out-of-sorts striker, just six months after they paid Milan £16million for him.

But Allegri, who managed Balotelli when at Milan, has poured cold water on the suggestions of a transfer.

He told Italian TV station RAI: 'I think this is a made-up story.

'Balotelli has done very well with me but he belongs to Liverpool and he is not a player that can arrive at Juventus.'

The 24-year-old has struggled for form since returning to the Premier League, scoring just twice in 18 appearances and failing to emulate the Luis Suarez, who moved from Anfield to Barcelona last summer.

Plagued by a groin injury, Balotelli has also not started a match since Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Chelsea at Anfield on November 8.

Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, believes the striker will rediscover his best form once his injury niggles clear up.

He told RAI: 'I'm not worried. Mario has been out for almost 10 weeks with an injury and you cannot judge him until he is 100 per cent fit.

'It's not easy to go abroad and adapt quickly to a new team.

'In the summer, it was right to leave Milan and I would do it again. Mario has gone to the best league in the world.

'Now he is not doing well at Liverpool for different reasons but Mario is calm and he is working to return to be in top conditions.

'I do not regret this transfer and Mario's departure from Milan.'
