An Oregon couple apparently was so appreciative of the excellent service they received at a high-class steakhouse in Seaside that they decided to leave their waitress a big tip - in the form of crystal meth.

Authorities say 40-year-old Ryan Benson and 37-year-old Erica Manly had dinner at the Twisted Fish Steakhouse on Thursday night, as well as several drinks.

When the bill came, the cash-strapped suspected drug dealers offered a gift card they had to settle their tab. Lacking any actual money to leave as a tip, the couple improvised.

After their bill had been settled with the gift card, Manly handed the waitress an envelope with a question mark scribbled on it. Inside, the waitress found crystal-like rocks.

The rocks, of course, turned out to be doses of crystal meth.

'[The waitress] was like ‘'Whoa -- what the …?’” Steve Keszler, a manager at the 
downtown steakhouse, told the Oregonian. 'We’re not a little dive bar or hole in the wall. 
We’re a classy place.'

When police arrived at the restaurant, the couple was still on the property and were taken into custody.

During a preliminary search of Manly's purse, authorities found nearly 20 ounces of meth worth an estimated $1,500.

Authorities later obtained a search warrant for a room at a nearby Holiday Inn Express, at which the couple had been staying. They found all the makings for a successful meth lab - a small torch, batteries and several other items commonly associated with cooking crystal meth.

Benson, authorities say, has been charged with possession and manufacture of methamphetamine. Manly was charged with possessing, delivering and manufacturing the drug.
