'The two guys tip the glass back. She took the shoes and put ‘em in her pocket book and went into the elevator,' Richard said Nicotra said. 'We see her getting off on the sixth floor with the shoes on.'

The hotel's owner, Richard , told the Staten Island Advance that he and his wife bought the shoes in Paris: 'Displayed for the last several years, they were meant to remind guests that while 'there's no place like home,' the Hilton strives to provide something close. 

Nicotra said that he is feels, 'Disappointed'. 'You feel violated.'

There are dozens of cameras at the hotel to protect the nearly $2 million in art that is hanging on the walls of the building.

Two men and the woman exited the building after stealing the slippers and the woman in fact wore them as she left the building.

'The trio proceeds to the adjacent elevator and a camera picks them up on the sixth floor; the woman apparently donned the slippers in the elevator cab. When last seen, by an exterior camera, she's climbing into a taxi.'
