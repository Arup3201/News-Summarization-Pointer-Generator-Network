It is the last journey you will ever make - so why opt for a plain wooden coffin when you could meet your maker in a giant chilli pepper?

This bizarre chilli-shaped casket is just one of a host of wacky designs commissioned by people keen to make their final farewell one to remember.

Other outlandish requests include a shark, a Coca Cola bottle, a Viking boat and even a mobile phone.

Something spicy: Ghanaian craftsman Paa Joe, whose work has been exhibited in Paris and New York, came up with this chilli pepper design

Something fishy: Paa Joe's bizarre coffin designs have inspired the team at Crazy Coffins in Nottingham

The chilli pepper is the work of Ghanaian craftsman Paa Joe - whose detailed creations have gone on display around the world.

Fantasy coffins - sometimes known as proverbial coffins - have become a tradition in Ghana, where many people believe in an afterlife and regard deceased ancestors as more powerful than the living.

The shape of the caskets often reflect the individual's profession or links to certain clans.

Paa Joe's efforts have helped to inspire Nottingham-based Crazy Coffins, which has been supplying caskets shaped like everything from football boots to bottle openers for a quarter of a century.

Crazy
Coffins, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, said demand 
for ever more outlandish designs is growing all the time.

Crazy Coffins is a subsidiary of Vic Fearn & Company, which has been making coffins since the 1860s, and regularly prepares designs for people who want to have a say in the casket they will be buried in after they're gone.

The kooky coffins have become a global success, selling to people around the world, and this week the company celebrated its quarter century mark with a colossal painting of their workforce.

The forty foot long and fifteen foot
high canvas depicts each member of staff who has served the company 
throughout their ambitious coffin creations.

Paa Joe is the subject of a new documentary, Paa Joe and the Lion, directed by Artdocs and funded by the Arts Council England.

He came to the UK in May for a one-month residency at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire, and Crazy Coffins took the opportunity to invite the fantasy coffin specialist to join in their milestone 25th anniversary celebrations.

Crazy
Coffins' director John Gill said: 'Each coffin is made to order and we 
cater for each person's wish - after all it's their choice how they go.

'It's
been a remarkable journey over the last 25 years and now our staff will
be looking over their successors as they toil on the factory floors 
below when we hang it up in the workshop.

'It's a beautiful piece of work, I'm very proud of it and what we've achieved.

'We're very privileged to have Paa Joe here - he has been at the forefront of this tradition for 60 years,' Mr Gill added.

Initially
a form of art designed simply to glorify the dead, a number of the 
coffins which have flowed from this tradition are now regarded as 
masterpieces on the international stage - with Paa Joe gaining worldwide recognition in the niche field.

Staff at Crazy Coffins described their special guest as a 'true genius'.

From his workshop in Nungua, Ghana, 
Paa Joe has been developing coffins since 1976 after he trained as an 
apprentice under master carpenter Kane Kwei.

Since then his work has been exhibited around the world at some of the most prestigious galleries in Paris and New York.

The 66-year-old has built hundreds of coffins during his career to look like mobile phones, pineapples, Coca Cola and beer bottles, chickens, cars and aeroplanes.

His finest piece of a work - a ten-foot long lion - wowed audiences at the event in Nottingham.

John said: 'The design is just beautiful and the craftsmanship that goes into it is astonishing - he's absolutely incredible, a true genius.

'It brings pleasure and enjoyment to people about a subject that is usually feared.

'Paa Joe's work has been changing the world and people's attitudes.'
