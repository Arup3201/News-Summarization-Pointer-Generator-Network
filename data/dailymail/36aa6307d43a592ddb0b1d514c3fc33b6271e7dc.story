A 27-year-old Chinese man has had a two stone (13kg) tumour removed from his back and neck.

Yang Xiao, from Xi'an in Shaanxi province, developed the tumour when he was a teenager and it grew steadily until it was removed on February 19.

He was warned surgery would be risky but that without it the tumour would continue to grow.

Yang Xiao, 27, has had surgery in China to remove a two stone tumour from his back. He is pictured (left) before the operation which took place on February 19 this year. He is pictured (right) after the surgery

As a result, he eventually underwent a nine-hour operation to remove the growth.

During the operation he lost so much blood that he had to been given around 40 pints of blood in the form of transfusions.

Dr Yang Li said the surgery was quite challenging because the tumor was tightly connected to the spine and was rich with blood vessels.

However, surgeons were able to remove it and Mr Yang was released from hospital on March 12.

Mr Yang developed a small tumour on his neck about ten years ago.

It grew rapidly and was soon as big as an egg.

Mr Yang's surgery took nine hours and surgeons said it was hard as the tumour was full of blood vessels

During the operation, Mr Yang lost so much blood he had to be given four adults worth in transfusions. He is pictured (centre) with his doctors and his father (second from the left)

In 2007, he went to hospital in Xi’an and the tumour was diagnosed as fibromatosis – a benign soft tissue tumour.

Mr Yang and his father, Yang Jigao, considered surgery and were warned it was difficult and risky.

As a result, his father, who had already lost his wife and daughter, decided not to take the risk.

After leaving the hospital, Mr Yang’s tumour continued to grow.

Mr Yang first developed a small tumour on his neck when he was a teenager but it grew rapidly

Mr Yang considered having surgery in 2007 but his father did not want him to as he was warned it was risky and he had already lost his wife and daughter so couldn't face losing his son as well

It was soon as large as half a football and more tumours had appeared on his back and collarbone.

At the end of 2013 the father and son returned to hospital – this time they went to Xijing Hospital, in Xi’an.

By this point the tumour on Mr Yang’s back measured 45cm from top to bottom and 30cm across.

It was also 17cm thick and weighed two stone.

Surgeons informed Mr Yang that surgery would be risky but that he would have a good chance of recovery.

Mr Yang's tumour was still growing so he eventually decided to have surgery and raised the money for an operation. He was warned it would be difficult but told he has a good chance of recovery

Mr Yang (pictured before the operation) had to give up his job because of the tumour

They also explained that without surgery the tumours would probably grow fast.

As a result, he and his father decided he should undergo surgery.

People from his hometown donated about £2,000, and his father borrowed £10,000, to pay for the operation.

Fibromatosis refers to a group of benign soft tissue tumours.

The tumours are rare but often grow aggressively and frequently return after they have been removed.
