Video of a intensely passionate Baltimore Ravens fan erupting in celebration during his team's amazing playoff win over the weekend has gone viral.

Keith Letourneau, 39, was watching Saturday's game against the Denver Broncos with his kids when the Ravens tied the game on a 70-yeard touchdown to wide receiver Jacoby Jones with just 31 seconds remaining in regulation. The team went on to win in double overtime.

His wife filmed his lengthy outburst and put the footage on YouTube where more than 200,000 people have viewed it.

Victory: Keith Letourneau bellows in celebration as his beloved Ravens tie their playoff game Saturday

'I was jumping around, screaming and yelling, then rolling around the floor,' he told the Baltimore Sun.

'It just so happens my wife was videotaping me and she put it up on YouTube and when she did, we had no idea it would take off like it did,' he insisted.

After jumping in front of his television,
Letourneau, wearing a Joe Flacco jersey, dropped to the ground, rolled 
around for a bit as his dog looked on and his 9-year-old son Trevor 
laughed at his dad's antics.

Rolling: Letourneau is so overcome with emotion, the grown man drops down and rolls around the ground as his dog and son, Trevor, look on in amazement.

'I'm very passionate when I watch a game,' he said.

'It doesn't matter if I'm home or at a 
bar with friends or even at the stadium. I'm just one of those fans who 
screams and yells and just wants to have a good time.'

In the middle of his outburst, he took a phone call from his dad and repeatedly told him 'I can't take it anymore.'

'The girls were initially upset with every outburst,' Rachel Letourneau 
said of their twin 7-year-old daughters Avery and Audrey.

'But then I said to them, 'You know what? I don't think there's 
any stopping this train today. Daddy's really, really, really excited. 
We just have to let it go for today.' And they did.'

Tired: Letourneau finally rests after his outburst concluded
