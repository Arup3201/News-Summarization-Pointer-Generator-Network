These are not scenes from an unannounced Harry Potter film - these are devoted fans acting out their favourite scenes from the series at a very real College of Wizardry in western Poland.

The event sees devotees gather at the Hogwarts-like castle of Czocha to immerse themselves in all things Harry Potter.

The English-speaking live-action role play event is inspired by JK Rowling's popular franchise and was created by role play specialists Liveform and Rollespilsfabrikken.

'Real-life Hogwarts': The first live-action role play event in November attracted 190 participants from 11 countries

Participants take on the roles from the books and films, and dress appropriately as students, teachers, or other fantasy characters.

The first-ever four-day event sold out in just two days, as 190 people (all at least 18 years old) from 11 countries gathered to create the mythical world.

'We got swamped by sign-ups and in two days the event was sold out,' Claus Raasted of Rollespilsfabrikken told the Telegraph. 'None of us had seen that coming.

Participants immersed themselves in the four-day, English-speaking event - taking on roles of students, teachers and janitors

Costumes are mandatory - with some revellers taking it very seriously, such as these women dressed as Dobby (left) and a student (right)

Visitors must be over 18 in order to engage in the role play - and the cost per player is €280 (approximately £220)

There are also a number of staff roles up for grabs - including professors, Hagrid the groundskeeper and janitor Argus Filch.
