A mother accused of smothering her three disabled children at her London home has been 'sectioned' and sent to a secure hospital for treatment.

Tania Clarence, 42, looked pale and fragile as she appeared via video-link at the Old Bailey, accused of killing her three-year-old twin sons, Ben and Max, and four year-old daughter, Olivia, at their home.

Wearing black jeans and a black zip-up fleece jumper, her voice shook with emotion as she confirmed her name in a thick South African accent at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.

Her investment banker husband, Gary, 43, wore a black suit and open-collar shirt and was supported by friends as he sat in the public gallery during the bail hearing.

Mrs Clarence is accused of three counts of murdering a child aged over one year old between April 20 and April 23 this year.

All three youngsters suffered from type 2 spinal muscular atrophy.

Also known as floppy baby syndrome, the genetic condition leaves children with little control of their movements and can drastically shorten life expectancy.

Police were called to the family’s five-bedroom home in Thetford Road in the wealthy south west London suburb of New Malden at 9.30pm last Tuesday night where they discovered the bodies.

Mrs Clarence was treated for cuts at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London, and later arrested.

The Old Bailey’s matron, wearing a distinctive blue nurse’s uniform, sat in the packed public gallery during the hearing.

Mrs Clarence is originally from South Africa and moved to Britain with her husband some years ago.

A plea and case management hearing will be held at the Old Bailey on July 15.

Judge Brian Barker, the Recorder of London, allowed Mrs Clarence to be released from prison under the Mental Health Act.

He told the Old Bailey he made the unusual move because it was an 'exceptional case' and to allow her to receive hospital treatment.

He said: 'There is a combination of circumstances here that makes this an exceptional case and allows this court to take an exceptional course.

'It isn't bail, but what we are doing is ordering for her to be subject to a Section 35 Order under the Mental Health Act, so she can then be remanded effectively for review of her condition.'

She was remanded to a secure hospital which cannot be identified.

The judge said the order should be processed by the end of the day and the case would be reviewed again in 28 days time.
