Northern Ireland's Attorney General, John Larkin, has directed new inquests into the deaths of people killed  in west Belfast in 1972 should be held

Northern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin has directed that new inquests into the deaths of people killed by the army in west Belfast in 1972 should be held.

Five people were killed in Springhill, Ballymurphy,  during the incident which became known as the Springhill Massacre.

At the time of the incident the Troubles in Northern Ireland had been going on for three years – and hundreds of people on both sides had already been killed by the warring factions.

The two clashing groups were Irish republicans wanting unification with the Republic of Ireland, and Ulster unionists, opposing Irish unification.

The British Army had been deployed to keep the two groups apart but Nationalists complained about the army's heavy-handedness.

Violence had been taking place all day on July 9 and the five dead were among ten people killed that day.

There are two disputing versions of the events of that day, with a Provisional IRA statement released the day after the event claiming British army snipers opened fire on two cars, before shooting residents who rushed to the aid of the injured.

The Army disputed this version of events and claimed its troops were fired on first by the IRA, ending a temporary IRA ceasefire.

Now, Mr Larkin has directed inquests to be opened into the deaths of Margaret Gargan, John Dougal, David McCafferty and Patrick Butler. 

West Belfast MP Paul Maskey (pictured right with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams) has welcomed the news

Sinn Fein West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said: 'The announcement by Attorney General John Larkin that inquests are to be held is welcome news for the families.

'The families have campaigned tirelessly for the truth and I commend their dignity and fortitude in bringing the campaign to this stage.

'The holding of the inquests is a step forward in getting to that truth and I hope that it will help bring justice to the families concerned.'
