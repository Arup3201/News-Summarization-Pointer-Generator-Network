More has been spent on rebuilding Afghanistan than the entire cost of lifting Europe from the ruins of the Second World War, according to a US government report published yesterday.

Corruption and waste have pushed the price of reconstructing Afghanistan to more than £62billion – and exceeding the amount the Allies provided under the Marshall Plan.

Named after US Secretary of State George Marshall, the 1948 scheme provided $13billion – the equivalent of £61billion today – over four years and helped rebuild 16 European countries.

Corruption and waste: Endemic corruption and waste have been blamed for the the country's international aid bill, which has exceeded £61.7billion ($104billion) in the 13 years since the Taliban were overthrown

Yet despite the money spent in 
Afghanistan, it remains mired in a political crisis and is likely to 
remain dependent on donors for years to come even as British and other 
foreign troops prepare to withdraw at the end of the year.

Development
 projects meant to provide Afghans with a sound structural foundation 
have cost American taxpayers £61.5billion and Britain a further 
£890million.

But in a report
 presented to US Congress this week, John Sopko, the Special Inspector 
General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, says most of the projects he 
audited were hampered by ‘poor planning, shoddy construction, mechanical
 failures and inadequate oversight’.

Huge clean up: By contrast, the Marshall Plan - America's initiative to aid Europe following the end of the Second World War - amounted to about £60.5billion ($102billion) at today's prices

Out of time: In five months, the mission changes from a military operation to a relatively small 'advise and assist' initiative - and most of the remaining allied soldiers will leave

He
 calculates that ‘by the end of 2014, the United States will have 
committed more funds to reconstruct Afghanistan, in inflation-adjusted 
terms, than it spent on 16 European countries after the Second World War
 under the Marshall Plan’.

The
 259-page report includes a photograph of a pile of school chairs in 
Nangarbar province that have been stripped to the metal so the wood 
could be burned for heat.

Billions were spent on ill-fated agricultural 
and infrastructure projects that failed to take into account 
Afghanistan’s terrain and culture, said the report.

expensive: Almost two-thirds of America's investment in Afghanistan's reconstruction has been funneled into building its military and police forces

Building: The Afghan government approved £4.5billion ($7.6billion) in spending this fiscal year, despite anticipated revenue of £1.6billion ($2.8billion)

More
 than £2billion was spent ‘improving’ the Afghan police yet tens of 
thousands of ‘ghost’ officers collect their pay but never turn up. 
Nearly half of the 747,000 firearms provided for Afghan security forces 
have vanished.

The report 
says the annual cost of maintaining Afghan’s police and military is 
likely to be double what the country collects in tax revenue.
