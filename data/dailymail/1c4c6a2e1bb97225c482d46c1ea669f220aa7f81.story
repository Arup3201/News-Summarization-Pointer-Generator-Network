For many viewers the BBC's Christmas schedule is the highlight of their televisual year and is as eagerly anticipated as Santa heading down the chimney.

But there is a good chance that this December it will feel less like Christmas day and more like Groundhog Day for families as they settle down in front of the box.

The broadcaster today announced it's festive programming, with the listings dominated by tried and tested old favourites, rather than new shows.

Returning: The BBC's Christmas schedule has been announced, complete with festive versions of favourites Strictly Come Dancing and The Great British Bake Off

Highlights include special episodes of The Great British Bake Off, Strictly Come Dancing and even a return to the screens of David Jason sitcom Open All Hours - which ran from 1973 to 1985 and has been reinvented as Still Open All Hours.

For Lord Hall's first Christmas as director-general the BBC, nicknamed 'Auntie', has gone with a familiar line up and a reliance on formats that are already favourites with viewers.

Period drama Call the Midwife, comedy Mrs Brown's Boys, Doctor Who and the return of Sherlock will all be promoted heavily by the corporation in the run up to Christmas.

However, experts have said that viewers prefer to watch special versions of their old favourites over the cosy festive season - with ratings stalwart EastEnders being a highlight of many families Christmas Day viewing.

Former Tory MP and 2010 Strictly contestant Ann Widdecombe agrees.

'The
 reason they do this is that old favourites are old favourites,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

'People like the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special. I'm sure
 they would like to see some fresh stuff but I don't think the average 
family will be that bothered.'

Viewers will also be treated to showings of Kung Fu Panda, Cars 2, Pirates of The Carribbean: On Stranger Tides, and Meet The Parents sequel Little Fockers.

Toy Story 3 will likely prove to be a popular choice, as the first in the trilogy was watched by 7.4million people on Christmas Day 2001 and the second by 6.5million in 2005.

Those who like their festive viewing in a little less technicolour will be able to tune into classic Ealing comedies, such as Titfield Thunderbolt, Whisky Galore and Kind Hearts And Coronets.

Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood will share their tips for a 
stress-free Christmas in The Great British Bake Off Christmas Special, 
and the semi-finalists of The Great British Sewing Bee return for a 
one-off festive edition.

The Call Centre crew will ditch their 
headsets to forge the Call Centre Christmas Choir, whilst Gareth Malone 
takes his own three 
work forces to the roots of choral singing in The Choir: Sing While You 
Work.

And Strictly viewers will be able to watch not just the final of the 2013 series, but also a Christmas
 special, as Bruce and Tess are joined on the dance floor by a host of 
special guests, including Sara Cox and Rufus Hound.

New faces: Kellie Bright and Danny Dyer will take over the Queen Vic, while Peter Capaldi is set to take over the Tardis in Doctor Who

There will also 
be three versions of returning favourite Top Of The Pops, including a 
Top Of The Pops 2 Christmas Special, and festive versions of Never Mind 
The Buzzcocks, Mock The Week and QI, while John Humphrys quizzes more 
famous faces as he and his famous black chair return for another series 
of Celebrity Mastermind.

There will of course be a few new arrivals, with Danny Dyer getting behind the bar of the new Queen Vic landlord in EastEnders, and new Doctor Peter Capaldi expected to take controls of the Tardis for the first time.

David Walliams is behind new children's comedy Gangsta Granny, and Mark Gatiss brings a dramatization of ghost story The Tractate Middoth to the screens.

Comedy: David Walliams is behind new children's comedy Gangsta Granny, which also stars Miranda Hart, Robbie Williams, Rob Brydon and Joanna Lumley

Popular: Toy Story 3 will likely prove to be a popular choice, as the first in the trilogy was watched by 7.4million people on Christmas Day 2001 and the second by 6.5million in 2005

Danny Cohen, Director of Television, said: 'Brilliant Christmas telly 
across Drama, Factual, Comedy, Entertainment and Religion is something 
licence-fee payers rightly expect from the BBC and this year's holiday 
schedule delivers that.'We have massive events such as the 
Doctor Who re-generation and the incredible return of Sherlock, as well 
as festive specials from hit shows including Strictly Come Dancing, Mrs 
Brown's Boys, Call The Midwife, Bad Education, and the Great British 
Bake Off.'And of course there are brand-new treats such as David
 Walliams' Gangsta Granny and we'll be showing a wide range of religious
 programming, including a live broadcast of The First Eucharist of 
Christmas from Westminster Abbey.'
