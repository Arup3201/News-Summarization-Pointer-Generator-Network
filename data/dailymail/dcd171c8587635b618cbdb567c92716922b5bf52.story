It is said of Alexander the Great that 'when he saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.'

Lionel Messi might be starting to feel the same way about breaking records. This week, the Barcelona superstar has become the all-time leading goalscorer in both La Liga and the Champions League, adding to his mammoth collection of personal bests.

But, as our map of all his goals in Europe's leading competition shows, there are plenty of lands still to conquer for the Argentinian wizard.

His hat-trick in Nicosia, Cyprus, on Tuesday night took him past Real Madrid legend Raul as the leading scorer in the Champions League with 74. It was also the 23rd European city and 16th European country in which Messi has hit the target in the continent's premier competition.

Our map of Lionel Messi's 74 Champions League goals shows the cities in which he has scored (and the number in each). The badge shows the opponent, with the exception of his home ground in Barcelona. Messi scored in Champions League finals against Manchester United in both Rome in 2009 and London in 2011. Scroll down for the full list of his goals.

Messi now has 74 goals in the Champions League and has scored in 23 different cities and 16 European countries in the competition

1st: Lionel Messi (Barcelona) - 74 goals

2nd: Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) - 71

3rd: Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 70

4th: Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 56

5th: Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) - 50

Barcelona will always be his home from home, of course, and 38 of his strikes in the Champions League have come in front of an adoring Nou Camp.

But Barca's - frequently successful - campaigns the length and breadth of Europe have seen Messi plunder goals in many leading cities.

He has scored three times against Celtic in Glasgow, Viktoria Plzen in Prague and Shakhtar in Donetsk. He added the Cypriot city of Nicosia to that list on Tuesday as Barcelona ran out 4-0 victors.

Messi has netted twice against Real in Madrid, PSG in Paris, Ajax in Amsterdam, AC Milan in the San Siro, BATE Borisov in Minsk and Spartak in Moscow.

And, proving that he can score just about anywhere, he's also been on target in Lisbon, London (against Manchester United in the 2011 final), Manchester, Lyon, Leverkusen, Stuttgart, Bremen, Basle, Rome (against United in the 2009 final), Copenhagen, Kiev and Athens.

With Messi breaking records seemingly at will right now, he perhaps can tick off a few more countries with a favourable draw in the seasons to come.

Poland, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Romania and Bulgaria are among the nations in which Messi has not yet scored. And, to adapt a popular barb aimed at him, he's not done it on a cold night in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 

As well as beating Raul's overall record - and keeping him ahead of rival Cristiano Ronaldo (70 goals) - Messi also wrote a few more lines in the record books.

It was his fifth hat-trick in the competition - a record - and he also has the most two-goal hauls with 20.

He has also scored in 24 different stadiums in the Champions League - more than anyone else.

Messi was also the scourge of Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final in Rome, where he scored Barcelona's second goal

Messi has scored on three occasions at Celtic Park, Glasgow, including this one back in February 2008

Messi is also the first player in the history of the European Cup and the Champions League to score five or more goals in eight consecutive seasons.

It continues a pretty good week for the 27-year-old, who broke Telmo Zarra's long-standing La Liga scoring record of 251 in Barcelona's 5-1 win over Sevilla at the weekend.

He may usurp Zarra again soon - Messi has 28 hat-tricks in competitive games for Barcelona, while Zarra has 31, the record for Spanish clubs.

Messi is also one behind Raul's record of 76 goals in all the European competitions, including the Super Cup.

So unlike the teary Alexander the Great, Messi still has plenty still to accomplish. Few doubt that he will do it.
