A man who was hell-bent on getting arrested, walked into a police station, dropped his pants and started masturbating in front of stunned cops.

Ruhan Karjohn, 31, from Hartford Connecticut initially went into the police station at 1pm on Sunday and asked cops if there were any warrants out for his arrest. 

He was told there were none and he left.

Bizzare: Ruhan Karjohn, from Hartford Connecticut was sent to jail after he masturbated in a police station

But a short time later he returned to the lobby of the police department and announced that he wanted to go to jail.

In a bizarre series of events, police said Karjohn then dropped his pants and began to masturbate.

According to a police report: 'Citizens in the lobby observed this and ran from the area in shock.'

Karjohn then got his wish and was arrested and sent to jail. 

He has been charged with public indecency and a breach of peace.
