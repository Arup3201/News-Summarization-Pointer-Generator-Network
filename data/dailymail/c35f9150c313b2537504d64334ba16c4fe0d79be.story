As could be expected from a wannabe glamourmodel and former prostitute who got a boob job paid by the NHS, Josie Cunningham celebrated her rumoured book deal by taking her clothes off.

The 23-year-old showed off the taxpayer's money in a photoshoot recreating Demi Moore's iconic Vanity Fair cover from 1991.

Josie, from Leeds, Yorkshire, claims she is bringing out a completely unedited autobiography in a bid to cash in on her new-found notoriety - and she could make £1million.

Pure class: Retired escort and wannabe glamourmodel Josie Cunningham, who famously had a boob job on the NHS, celebrates her book deals with a naked pregnancy shoot, showing off her stomach tattoo

The seven months pregnant benefits benefactor has announced plans to reveal the inside story of her controversial life and is currently considering two offers of book deals.

Miss Cunningham provoked outrage last year when it emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job thanks to the same NHS Trust that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to walk.

Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction.

After a series of further controversies this month, she took to Twitter to announce her book plans yesterday.

She tweeted: 'I understand why people are judging me in the way they are, all I ask is that before making your conclusive opinion on me - wait for my book to come out at the end of the year.'

She later added: 'I have been offered two book deals, I haven't signed either yet but I will next week - both are very appealing.'

Her agent 
Rob Cooper told MailOnline that the book will be 'Josie's exact words, 
completely unedited', meaning spelling and grammar mistakes will be 
included.

Friends have said that the book could be littered with errors after Miss Cunningham misspelled 'positive', 'negatively' and 'likely' in the introduction to her website and missed an apostrophe out of 'it's'.

The site's homepage reads: 'If you are reading this, then its quite likley you have read something about my life that has impacted you in either a possitive way, but most likley negativley.'

The Sun reported today that the former escort is hoping to make £1million out of the book, which she thinks will be a Christmas bestseller.

Miss Cunningham announced the plans on Twitter yesterday, insisting the book will answer all of her critics

The news came after a series of controversies involving the former escort, who is seven months pregnant

Miss Cunningham's agent says the book's text will be exclusively her words, including spelling mistakes

It comes 
after Miss Cunningham, who is due to give birth in two months after 
getting pregnant while working as a call girl, revealed she turned to 
alcohol and cigarettes to get over the disappointment that her baby was a
 boy.

It
 also emerged last week that Miss Cunningham's two children, aged six 
and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school,
 twice a day.

The
 journey, which costs Leeds Council £30 a day, would cost around £30 a 
week by bus, but Miss Cunningham insists it is worth it, and says 
taxpayers should be grateful she uses taxis rather than more expensive 
private hire cars.

She later wrote on Twitter: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but tax payers will always fund me.'
