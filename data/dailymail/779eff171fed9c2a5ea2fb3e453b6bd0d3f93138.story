These are the first images of a polar bear looking after her new born cub at a zoo in Germany.

The tiny animal, which is just weeks old, can be seen clambering over its mother Vilma in their birthing cave at Rostock Zoo in the north of the country.

Staff say the cub, which has yet to be named, was born on Vilma's 12th birthday and is so young it has yet to fully open its eyes.

The first images have been released of a polar bear cub born just two weeks ago at Rostock Zoo in Germany

In one picture, Vilma can be seen lying on her back and gently resting one of her huge paws over the cub.  

According to German website Rostock Heute, the father is a male called Lars - the same bear that fathered Knut, a cub born in captivity in Berlin eight years ago.

The mother and her newborn are currently alone in the cave and are only visible through images beamed from a video camera.

Zoo bosses said the birth took place on December 3 and comes amid plans to build a new £7.85million facility for polar bears and penguins in 2016.

The last polar bear births at the zoo were ten years ago in 2004 when twins Venus and Valeska were born.

Staff say Vilma, who has become a mother for the second time, is looking after her cub 'intensely' and that the young animal is already putting on weight.

Two years ago she had a daughter named Anori after giving birth at a zoo in Wuppertal near Dusseldorf. 

Polar bear cubs generally weigh about 450-850 grams at birth and only open their eyes between 21 and 34 days later.
