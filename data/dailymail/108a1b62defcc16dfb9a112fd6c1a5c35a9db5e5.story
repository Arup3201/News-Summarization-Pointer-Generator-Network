Peter Farlecas, from Victoria, was pulled unconscious from the water at Mooloolaba beach on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Sunday after nearby spectators spotted him face down in the surf.

In front of friends and family, including his wife Luisa, the event's medical team attempted to save the IT consultant, performing CPR, but after half an hour he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Nine News reported the father of three, was competing with about 15 other colleagues from an IT systems availability business, who only found out about his death as they crossed the finish line.

'Four guys stripped off and ran in and were putting their hand up and were waiting for boat,' a witness told Nine News.

Ironman Asia Pacific CEO Geoff Meyer told ABC News that the 39-year-old man from Victoria suffered a suspected heart attack during the swim stage of the Ironman 70.3 event at about 7:30am on Sunday.

'It's been a real tragedy we have had a death in the swim today,' Mr Meyer said.

'He had been lost a significant amount of weight and had been training for six months.'
