Novak Djokovic is the man of the moment down under after securing his fifth Australian Open title in Melbourne.

The World No 1 defeated Scot Andy Murray 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday to secure his eighth Grand Slam crown and has now set his sights on the French Open, the only major to currently elude him. 

The Serbian posed for photographers with the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne to toast his success with a glass of champagne.

Novak Djokovic has joined an illustrious list of Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl in winning his eighth grand slam title in the Australian Open.

However the World No 1 has already set his sights on becoming just the eighth player to win all four of the game's biggest tournaments by claiming a first French Open in Paris. 

'It's incredible to be able to win eight,' said Djokovic. 'I still feel as a 27-year-old I have years to come. Hopefully if I stay healthy and have this disciplined professionalism and commitment to everyday rituals and things I have been doing the last few years, I think I have a fair chance to get myself in another position to win a grand slam or two or three.

'At this point I am happy with where I am in my life and to be able to join the elite group of players like Agassi and Lendl who won eight grand slams is quite remarkable and I am very proud of it.

'Most of the players will tell you it's important to have the mindset that keeps you in the present moment and once something is done you move on and try to focus on the next one and try not to think too much in advance or in the past, because that allows you to work and reset your ambitions and your goals.

'But I think you have to be honest and say you think about the amount of grand slams you won and tournaments you won and what your place in history is. I definitely have that in the back of my mind and I am very pleased with my accomplishments so far.'

Djokovic has lost twice to nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal in the final, last year and 2012, acknowledging the Spaniard will be the clear favourite in May.

'I wasn't too far from winning a title both times when I lost to Rafa but it's a grand slam on the slowest surface that is physically the most demanding one.

'That's something that makes it more difficult in terms of winning against Nadal, he has lost only one match in his entire career which is probably the most impressive record in tennis history of all time.

'It's very important (winning the French Open) but if I don't succeed in doing that in my career it's not the end of the world, but I am definitely going to keep on trying. I have been very very close and that allows me to believe I can make that final step and that's something that keeps me going.'

Murray shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in Melbourne on Sunday

Andy Murray had plenty of chances but eventually succumbed to a relentless Djokovic, who won his fifth Australian Open in as many finals.

Despite appearing to struggle physically, which Murray admitted after the brutal contest that he was distracted by the Serbian's antics, Djokovic prevailed in emphatic fashion by winning 12 of the last 13 games, leaving Murray defeated for a fourth time in the Melbourne show piece.

'He is there and if he won a couple more matches he would have maybe five grand slams now and it would be a different story,' Djokovic added. 'On the other hand I could as well maybe have won a few more. But this is the generation we are in. There are four players that are incredibly good and very few points decide the winner.

'I believe they (Federer and Nadal) made me a better player and also Andy; they made me understand what I need to do to improve my game to get on the level where they are.

'You can maybe think if I was in another era I would be in double figures already, but everything happens for a reason. I am sure Andy is disappointed not to win a few more grand slams but he is also a better player as a consequence of being a rival of the other three guys.'
