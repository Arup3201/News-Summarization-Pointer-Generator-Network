An alleged gang rape involving Dominique Strauss-Kahn became the subject of a formal investigation by French prosecutors yesterday.

It follows a complaint by a Belgian prostitute that she was attacked by the former head of the International Monetary Fund in a hotel room in Washington.

The alleged crime is said to have taken place in December 2010 at the hotel, close to the White House.

Standing together: Dominique Strauss-Khan with his wife Anne. He has become the subject of a formal investigation by French prosecutors

Described by three judges as a possible ‘gang rape’, it is expected to form vital evidence in the case against an alleged prostitution ring working out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, northern France.

Strauss-Kahn, 63, has already been charged with aggravated pimping in relation to the Carlton affair, but his legal team has argued that he could not have known that women participating in alleged orgies were prostitutes – because they were undressed.

His lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said: ‘He could easily not have known, because, as you can imagine, at these kinds of parties you’re not always dressed, and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman.’

Prosecutors in Lille yesterday confirmed that they had opened a formal investigation into the alleged Washington gang rape.

Highly paid young women working for the ring are said to have flown to the US to take part in ‘sex parties’ with Strauss-Kahn and other men at the W Hotel in Washington.

Referring to Strauss-Kahn, a 25-year-old Belgian prostitute identified only as Marie-Anne S, said: ‘He used force. He was holding my hand, he pulled my hair, he hurt me. I weigh 50 kilos [about seven-and-a-half stone], he’s heavier than me.’

She claimed that Strauss-Kahn tried to force her to commit a particular sex act, adding: ‘I refused and told him no, I don’t want to. I made it clear that I did not want to, several times out loud.’

Three examining judges asked prosecutors to consider the ‘facts of the gang rape’, and a spokesman for Lille prosecutors said: ‘A formal inquiry has now begun.’

The four men under investigation for the alleged rape are Strauss-Kahn; Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a former police chief from Lille; and two businessmen, David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski. The latter is said to have regularly exchanged text messages with Strauss-Kahn.

Roquet is said to have held Marie-Anne S by the wrists as Strauss-Kahn performed a sex act on her, and the other men are said to have ignored her pleas for help.

Both women were said to be posing as secretaries and were paid £2,000 to go on the three-day trip.

The rape itself is said to have taken place on December 16, with the four men and two prostitutes taking part in an orgy in a suite at the W Hotel.

Co-accused: Former Lille police chief Jean-Christophe Lagarde is also under investigation

Another vice girl involved, identified as Aurelie D, 26, has claimed that sexual acts took place at the party, saying of Marie-Anne S: ‘I saw she did not like it. But I did not hear her say no. If she had shouted I would have heard her, and would have intervened.’

Aurelie D said she was ‘too busy’ having sex to see too much of what was going on with Marie-Anne S.

Strauss-Kahn, in turn, has told police that there was ‘no brutality’ involved in the orgy under investigation.

In a separate case, he has been denied diplomatic immunity from being sued over an alleged attempted rape of a New York chambermaid in May 2011.

In a ruling handed down in Bronx Supreme Court, Justice Douglas McKeon threw out a motion to have the civil case dismissed, raising the prospect of a New York trial.

Strauss-Kahn is accused of attempting to rape hotel employee Nafissatou Diallo, 33, at Manhattan’s Sofitel Hotel.

She claims that the married Frenchman ran at her naked, molested her and forced her to perform a sex act on him after she entered his suite to clean it.

The claims led to a criminal investigation against Strauss-Kahn and his house arrest in New York, but charges were dropped.

The allegations meant he had to give up his political ambitions to be the Socialist candidate for the presidency of France this year.

He is currently unemployed and living in Paris with his third wife, journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair.

Just over a year ago, Dominique Strauss Kahn was the favourite Socialist candidate to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, hotly-tipped to become France's next president.

However, his long and distinguished career - and world - came crashing down in the space of a few short months sparked by an allegation of rape and a subsequent string shocking revelations about his sex life.

Shameful fall from grace: Dominique Strauss-Kahn
