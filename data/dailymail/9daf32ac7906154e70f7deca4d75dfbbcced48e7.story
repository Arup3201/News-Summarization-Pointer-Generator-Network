Abu Qatada yesterday made a shock offer to leave Britain  – as long as his human rights are protected.

The Al Qaeda hate preacher has spent eight years fighting deportation to Jordan, inflicting a string of humiliating human rights court defeats on the Government and costing taxpayers £3.6million in the process.

But Qatada’s lawyers now say he will board a plane without any further protest if Britain and Jordan ratify a treaty guaranteeing him a fair trial back home.

Remaining in Britain? Abu Qatada's legal team have used a hearing today to pledge he will leave the UK for Jordan if a non-torture treaty is signed

David Cameron welcomed the news, saying: ‘We have a fully worked-out plan to get this man out of our country, and if he goes of his own accord, frankly, I’ll be one of the happiest people in Britain.’

It means the Muslim cleric, once described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could leave within months. Once he is out of the country, security officials will put a block on the fanatic ever being allowed to return to the UK.

Qatada’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald QC, made the unexpected announcement at a bail hearing at the special immigration appeals commission in London.

Mr Fitzgerald also said that his client, who is being held in Belmarsh prison on bail violations, wanted to spend some time with his family before leaving for Jordan.

The Home Office released this image of Home Secretary Theresa May signing the fair trial guarantees with Jordan that she believes will reassure courts that torture evidence would not be used against Abu Qatada

David Cameron is considering a temporary withdrawal from the European human rights convention in order to finally remove Abu Qatada from Britain

Still smiling: Labour and Conservative ministers have been trying to deport Qatada for a decade but have failed

September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport.

May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain.

April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment.

February 2001
- He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to 
bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him in possession of 
£170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the 
mujahedin in Chechnya'.

August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan.

April 2008
- The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human 
rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been 
obtained through torture.

February 18 2009
- In a landmark judgment, five Law Lords unanimously back the 
Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the 
basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be 
deported to Jordan to face terror charges.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months.

March
6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears the terror suspect was 
trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions.

March 27 2013
- Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules 
sending him to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court.

April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal.

He gave no indication as to whether they
would be joining him in Jordan, where he faces terror charges after 
being convicted in his absence in 1999.

But it is understood there is no legal
basis for forcibly removing his wife and five children from their 
taxpayer-funded home in North London. Two of the children were born in 
Britain.

The breakthrough is a victory for 
Theresa May, who announced last month that she had thrashed out a mutual
assistance treaty with Jordan, guaranteeing Qatada the right to a fair 
trial.

Human rights judges in Britain and 
Strasbourg had halted his removal to Jordan on the grounds some of the 
evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Mr 
Fitzgerald said Mrs May’s treaty had been the key development in the 
case.

He added: ‘In light of that treaty I’m
authorised to say that if, and when, the Jordanian parliament ratifies 
the treaty he will voluntarily return to Jordan.’

The new treaty is expected to be 
ratified in the UK next month and a Jordanian minister has suggested it 
could be cleared in his country within a matter of months.

After telling the hearing of Qatada’s 
pledge to leave, Mr Fitzgerald attempted to secure his client’s release 
from Belmarsh prison to his home in north London. He said: ‘Bail 
conditions can be as stringent as possible. Even, if necessary, 24 hours
in the house.’

Mr Fitzgerald insisted Qatada’s pledge to return voluntarily to Jordan meant there was no longer a threat that he could abscond.

He said: ‘All he wants, when obviously he is planning to go back to Jordan, is some time with his family.

‘The risk of absconsion, which was a 
major concern, has gone.’ Robin Tam QC, appearing for the Home 
Secretary, said the treaty would be put before the Jordanian parliament 
in the next few weeks, while the British side of the process should be 
completed by late June.

Mr Justice Irwin asked Mr Tam to provide evidence of the process in the UK and Jordan in bringing the treaty into force.

He added: ‘The critical point is not merely ratification but when the treaty is enforced.’

Qatada’s bail conditions prevent him 
from turning mobile phones on in his house. But the court heard how 
Qatada had been remanded in custody after police searching his house on 
March 7, 2013 discovered mobile phones, USB sticks and recordable CDs.

Mr Justice Irwin told the court that 17 mobile phones were found in the house.

He said: ‘Six of them were switched 
on, two belonging to one of the sons, one found in [Qatada’s] bedroom, 
two belonging to daughters and the sixth which was switched on was in a 
bag in a downstairs room.’

Mr Fitzgerald said: ‘It’s accepted he did not exercise due diligence in relation to the phones and USB sticks.

Probe: Police inspected the hate preacher's 
London home as the radical cleric was arrested for allegedly breaching 
his bail conditions in March

Mrs May said the deal will 'finally' make it 
possible to kick Qatada out and Labour's shadow home secretary  Yvette Cooper said the QC's statement 'could be very good news'

‘All he would say would be they were not his phones and there is no evidence they were used unlawfully.’

But Mr Justice Irwin warned that the 
breaches were ‘significant’, adding: ‘The bail conditions are really 
focused on one thing, stopping this man spreading his ideas.’

The bail application was adjourned until May 20, with Qatada remaining in custody.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home 
affairs select committee, said: ‘The Home Secretary must get on a plane 
to Jordan and secure ratification immediately before Mr Qatada changes 
his mind.’
