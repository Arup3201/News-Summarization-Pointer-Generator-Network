This may look like a scene from a sci-fi film as Earth comes under attack from two shimmering UFOs.

But it’s actually a bizarre cloud formation captured by amateur photographer Alberto Ostacchini, who watched the apocalyptic moment unfold while he was out snapping pictures of local wildlife.

The 61-year-old from Bo'ness in West Lothian, Scotland, had been hoping to photograph wading birds - but spotted through his viewfinder what appeared to be two flying saucers by the River Forth.

Extraordinary: Amateur photographer Alberto Ostacchini watched the apocalyptic scene unfold while he was out snapping pictures of local wildlife over Grangemouth oil refinery on the River Forth

The sky was a striking shade of red and orange, with huge lenticular clouds hanging over Grangemouth oil refinery on the river.

Mr Ostacchini, a retired tanker driver at the refinery, said: ‘I often go to a place close to where I live called Kinneil Kerse to take photographs. When the tide is out there are all sorts of wading birds.

‘I love to take photos of wildlife but I will capture anything that looks pretty. Recently I was there as the sun was going down.

‘I started taking a few photos of the Grangemouth oil refinery which was a silhouette against the evening sky. It was only then I noticed the clouds in the background were a very strange shape.

'The clouds looked a lot like flying saucers and the whole scene resembled something from a sci-fi film'

‘They looked a lot like flying saucers and the whole scene resembled something from a sci-fi film. I love clouds and I take a lot of photos of them but this one I am especially proud of.’

A Cloud Appreciation Society spokesman
said: ‘The disc-shaped forms hovering over the oil refinery are caused 
by winds being forced to rise to pass over the Scottish Highlands and 
developing a wave-like path in the lee of the mountain peaks. The saucer clouds appear at the crests of these invisible waves of air.’

Three-day weather map: Forecasters predicted that areas of showery rain will move southwards across England and Wales overnight tonight, as well as eastern parts of Scotland for a time

The photos were released as forecasters predicted that areas of showery rain will move southwards across England and Wales overnight, as well as eastern parts of Scotland for a time.

It will be largely dry elsewhere in Scotland, along with Northern Ireland, with clear periods expected.

Tomorrow, England and Wales will be rather cloudy with scattered showers, some of which could be heavy with the risk of the odd rumble of thunder, especially across central parts.

However, there will be some sunny spells breaking through in places. Southern and Eastern Scotland may see the odd spot of rain for a time, but it will be generally fine and warm elsewhere in the UK.
