In a crisis, Peaches Geldof is nothing if not versatile.

Having accidentally tipped her baby out of his buggy while chatting on the phone, the young mother expertly demonstrated how to scoop him back up…while carrying on the conversation.

Miss Geldof, 23, was quick to point a finger of blame for the calamity at London’s potholed pavements.

Over he goes: Little Astala lies half out of the pram, but Peaches still has her phone in hand

Writing about the incident on Twitter, she said four-month-old Astala wasn’t injured. She insisted he had been strapped in but it would appear he was saved mostly by the hood of his buggy.

‘It’s impossible to see these cracks when pushing a pram,’ she wrote. ‘The Mayor of London should do something about it it’s ridiculous!’

Miss Geldof married rock singer Thomas Cohen, 20, on Saturday. The pair bought a flat in East London, before Astala was born in April.

They wed in the same church where the family said goodbye to her mother Paula Yates 12 years ago.

Friends and family of the couple made their way to the picturesque St Mary Magdalene at St Lawrence Church in the village of Davington, near Faversham in Kent.

It is the second wedding for Sir Bob Geldof's daughter who wed American singer Max Drummey in Las Vegas in 2008.

Hands free: She continues to chat as she gathers him up and is still on the phone as she comforts him

Blame: The new mother took to Twitter to point the finger at the state of London's potholes

The couple split in February 2009 but were not divorced until April 2011.

Many of those arriving at the wedding were seen sporting retro-inspired outfits and there were certainly a number of snappy styles on show.

On Friday Peaches posted a snap of her left hand to her Twitter page and wrote: 'Very soon my engagement ring will have a wedding band under it! SO excited- my last few days of not being a wife!!!!'

Peaches was known for being a party girl in her late teens and early twenties but has settled down in recent years.

Earlier this week the DJ enjoyed her hen party at a sushi restaurant in London but the event was an extremely timid affair with Peaches back at home before 11pm.

Peaches and Tom announced their engagement in December last year and shortly after they revealed that Peaches was expecting their first child.

Peaches' mother Paula died from a heroin overdose in 2000 leaving her and her sisters Pixie, Fifi and Tiger Lily to be brought up by Geldof.
