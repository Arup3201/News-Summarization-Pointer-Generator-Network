Actress Naomi Watts shocked the world when she announced the late Princess Diana had given her 'permission' to play her on screen.

But she is not the only one who believes the tragic royal is communicating with them from beyond the grave.

Ken and Jo Dobson, who describe themselves as 'Britain's biggest Diana fanatics', claim to have experienced 'unmistakable' signals from the former Princess of Wales - and even believe they have seen her spirit.

Dedicated: Jo and Ken Dobson say Princess Diana interacts with them from beyond the grave

Fan: Jo and Ken have met, among others, Diana's brother Earl Spencer and former butler Paul Burrell

The Gloucestershire pair, who first developed a fascination with the People's Princess when she entered public life with her engagement to Prince Charles in 1981, have amassed collectibles worth thousands of pounds and have dedicated their lives to preserving her memory.

Jo, 74, said: 'We've loved Diana from day one.There was something about that young lady that just drew you to her. We can't explain it - we just loved her.'

But it wasn't until after her untimely death in Paris in 1997 that they decided to formalise their devotion by co-founding the 'Diana Circle UK'.

'There are seven of us all together and we started this two years after Diana died,' said Jo. 'We were all standing outside Kensington Palace and we said "this woman must never be forgotten - we must keep her memory alive".'

Every inch of their modest bungalow is now dedicated to Diana and they have so many photographs, sketches, plates and dolls that they are considering getting planning permission for an extension - or even erecting a tent in their garden.Â 

Collection: Jo and Ken have amassed memorabilia worth many thousands of pounds over the last 30 years

Shrine: The couple are convinced Diana was murdered and was 'like a lamb to the slaughter'

They believe the huge collection could be worth a five-figure sum but say they would never sell any of the memorabilia.

'We're not worried about the money in this, we just buy, buy, buy,' said Ken, 76.

The couple say they are also in contact with Diana's former butler Paul Burrell and speak to him 'once a week'.

They constantly study the circumstances of her death and have no doubt she was murdered.

'She was a like a lamb to the slaughter,' said Ken, who recently lost his sight and believes Diana helped him through his stay in hospital.

'We don't think the truth will come out in our time - but it will in years to come.'

Like Diana, who was once friends with TV medium Psychic Sally, Ken and Jo are spiritualists and say they have forged a bond with Diana.

Spooky: According to Jo, Diana's face briefly appeared on a Christmas fairy one year before fading away

Memory: The pair co-founded the Diana Circle UK and hope to keep memories of the late princess alive

According to the couple, signs 
include white feathers that have mysteriously fallen from the sky and a 
special Diana candle which went out as her body was taken back to her 
childhood home of Althorp in Northamptionshire.

They
also have a rose bush in their back garden, which they say develops red
blotches around the day of Diana's death, which they call 'blood 
spots'.

However, the strongest signal to date came at Christmas one year, recalls Jo. 'I'll never forget it,' she said.

'We were at my sister's one year and she always had a big Christmas tree for her grandchildren. I just happened to glance up and instead of the fairy on top of the tree there was Diana's face - and she was just looking down smiling.

'Then she gradually faded away until she was gone. We are not spooky or anything but we believe it. We don't care what other people say.'

Disapproval: The Dobsons have said that they are not impressed by the new biopic of Princess Diana

Despite their determination to keep Diana's memory alive, they are horrified by the release of the new film, Diana, which hit cinemas earlier this month.

Jo, who says the only royals she has time for are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, said: 'We've got no time for this Diana film. I think in a way it's disgusting they've done this because 16 years on and that young girl could not be laid to rest.

'It's ruining Diana's reputation, that poor girl. She's done a lot for this country.'

With the closing of the official Diana museum last month, Jo and Ken's next step is to try and inspire the next generation of Diana fans to continue the efforts of the Diana Circle UK, and preserve the memory of the People's Princess for years to come.
