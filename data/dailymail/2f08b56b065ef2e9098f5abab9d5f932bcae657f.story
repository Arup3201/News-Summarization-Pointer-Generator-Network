Five officials with connections to FIFA and who were all involved in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups are at the centre of a Swiss criminal investigation, according to the man who wants to be FIFA’s next president.

And Jerome Champagne, a former long-standing FIFA insider who is the only currently declared rival to Sepp Blatter for next year’s presidential race, has told the Mail on Sunday that if any of the five are found guilty of wrong-doing, the entire bidding process should be invalidated.

Russia was awarded the 2018 tournament and Qatar the 2022 event in a vote that happened four years ago next month. But corruption allegations have persistently swirled around those decisions and FIFA announced last week they had lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland into ‘the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.’

No information has been confirmed by FIFA about the number of individuals or their identities although it is believed more than one are FIFA ExCo voters who influenced the destination of the 2018 and 2022 events.

This development came amid the ongoing controversy of the FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s summary of FIFA investigator Michael Garcia’s investigation into the process.

‘I am a strong defender of the principle of innocent until proven guilty but it is clear that what is at stake is enormous,’ Champagne told The Mail on Sunday.

‘We need to know how the voting unfolded and how it was influenced. Even if one vote was improperly influenced that is too many.

‘Was it one or none? Or five? If it was five then is that enough to change outcome? Yes. Qatar won 14-8. The problem is we need to know and we don’t know.’

Champagne added that it is his belief that FIFA’s probe into corruption allegations is effectively ongoing. ‘It is an unfinished FIFA ethics investigation … the request [to the Swiss Attorney General] is about five officials of FIFA.’

Champagne called for the full findings of Garcia’s report to be made public, even though Eckert has insisted that will never happen. ‘I’ve consistently and repeatedly called for transparency,’ Champagne said. ‘What has happened over the past week only reinforces the need for that, more than ever.

‘It has been almost four since that vote on 2 December 2010 and it continues to make me sad that the World Cup, the pinnacle of our game, remains tainted. We need to know what happened.’

Eckert’s 42-page summary caused huge controversy in identifying - and then traducing - two whistleblowers who gave extensive assistance to Garcia. Bonita Mersiades, a former Australian bid insider, and Phaedra Almajid, who worked for Qatar 2022, spoke out in these pages last week about their disgust at their treatment.

They both subsequently made formal complaints to FIFA about Eckert allegedly breaching article 16.1 of FIFA’s own ethics code in making them clearly identifiable in his summary. They have not even received any acknowledgement of their complaint, let alone any explanation.

‘I was stunned that the whistleblowers were described in the way they were so that they could be identified,’ Champagne says. ‘They are courageous people and they were failed by this report.’

Eckert effectively dismissed both Mersiades and Almajid as inaccurate and unreliable. But the Mail on Sunday can exclusively reveal that Garcia found them so valuable to his intelligence-gathering that he used tens of thousands of dollars of FIFA money to facilitate meeting them.

Meanwhile, campaigning MP Damian Collins, who has a track record of pushing for FIFA reform, has secured a parliamentary debate on December 1 in the House of Commons on the subject of the Serious Fraud Office and FIFA. It is expected that various allegations of corruption surrounding the world governing body and the 2018 and 2022 process will be aired under parliamentary privilege.
