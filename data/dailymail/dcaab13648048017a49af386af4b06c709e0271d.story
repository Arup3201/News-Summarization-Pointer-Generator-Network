A woman who allegedly gave birth in a sports pub bathroom and hid her baby in a toilet tank before returning to the bar watch a pay-per-view wrestling match could face the death penalty.

Prosecutors will seek the sentence for Amanda Hein, 27, who is accused of suffocating the boy by wrapping him in a plastic bag before hiding him in the toilet at Starters Pub in Lower Saucon Township, Pennsylvania last August.

Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said that Hein deserves to be executed because she killed a child, according to NBC Philadelphia.

Hein was at the bar with three male friends when she excused herself to go to the bathroom.

One of her companions said that she didn't return for an 'extended period of time' and that he and other members of the group text her to see if she was okay.

According to Mr Morganelli, Luis Riviera told police that when Hein eventually returned from the toilet she was stained with blood but wouldn't explain what had happened and refused any help.

Prosecutors claim that Hein remained at the pub to watch a pay-pre-view wrestling match with the group for another hour before leaving.

Cleaners found the baby's body the following day when the toilet would not flush.

Authorities believe that Hein was in the bathroom for around 40 minutes and cleaned up the stall after giving birth to the baby, who was four to seven weeks premature.

Detectives traced Hein after finding traces of her blood in a bar booth.

Hein of Allentown will stand trial for criminal homicide.

Speaking out after charges were brought against Hein, her biological mother Giesen told The Morning Call she was devastated that her daughter had suffered in silence.

'I just wish she would have even texted me and said, "Please help me",' Giesen, of Coopersburg, said.

'I'm her mother and the thing that breaks my heart is she didn't come to me. She didn't ask for help.'

Giesen
 said her daughter, who had no significant criminal history, documented 
domestic abuse or civil judgments due to financial hardship, was 'very 
fragile'.

'She told me she thought I hated her and I don't hate her. I love her,' Giesen said.

She said she'd tried to get psychiatric help for Hein, but there was little she could do because her daughter was an adult.

Giesen,
 a born-again Christian, said she and her daughter 'don't see eye to eye
 on moral issues' and she didn't approve of Hein's lifestyle or 
ex-boyfriend.

'I don't judge her,' Giesen said. 'Anything I didn't agree with I kept to myself, because what was I going to do?'

Giesen
 said her daughter kept her troubles to herself, including her 
pregnancy: 'I don't know what she was going through because she never 
told me. She kept that completely to herself.'

At the time of the incident, Hein's stepmother, Louiseann
 Hein, told The Morning Call that her troubled stepdaughter lived with her and her husband in Allentown,
 Pennsylvania for the last six months.

She never suspected that Hein, then 26, was pregnant.

Mrs Hein said she recalled having a conversation about pregnancy with Hein when the young woman received a piece of mail from Planned Parenthood.

'I told her she always had a home here,' Louiseann Hein told the newspaper, as she struggled to maintain her composure.

'We would make room. Would find a way.'
