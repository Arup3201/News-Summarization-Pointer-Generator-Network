Twenty one years ago this week, James Dyson launched his iconic vacuum cleaner in the UK.

Today, millions of these vacuums are helping clean dirt in households across the world – but despite global success, it seems there is one design the engineer may be kicking himself for not pursuing.

According to recently revealed documents, Britain’s most famous modern inventor may have been better known for his own version of Google Glass, had he not shelved the idea in 2001.

The documents show how thirteen years ago, the Wiltshire–based company developed an augmented reality headset that it intended to call Dyson Halo.

Early designs of the Halo prototype suggest it would have been a cross between Google Glass and a Walkman, with thin metal band surrounding by wires.

The system, referred to under the secret project name N066, could be carried in the user's pocket, working both as a communications device and computer.

The headset. which may be folded, could be used in audio only mode using voice commands and text-to-speech. This design sketch shows the headset folded together

Dyson had other inventions that never made the cut. Among them, was a fuel cell, which would have allowed Dyson’s digital motor in its vacuums to run on hydrogen and oxygen.

Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy from hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. Fuel cells require a large, constant source of both hydrogen and oxygen to run, but produce electricity continuously.

For three years, 10 Dyson engineers worked to adapt a Dyson digital motor so it could sit at the heart of a fuel cell. The aim was to increase performance whilst reducing size.

The eventually designed a compact, lightweight and highly efficient digital motor V4HF resulted in a 20 per cent increase in power density and improved efficiency. The start-up time became almost three times faster. 

On the headset, two plane mirrors reflected the display of two tiny monitors which were mounted close to the wearer’s temples, onto a prism.

This created an illusion of a projected, translucent, 10inch (25cm) display around three feet (one metre) in front of the user.

A virtual personal assistant, similar to Siri, could read out emails and interpret basic voice commands.

Dyson also intended a keyboard to be projected in front of the user so that one could type and write emails on any surface.

The headset. which could be folded, had the option of being used in audio only mode with voice commands and text-to-speech.

The idea was that users could drive while using the computer, or use it on the go without the display, giving the effect of having a personal assistant whispering in your ear.

The headset could be detached from the wearable computer, and the mobile device could be docked into a monitor to become a desktop computer, giving the same effect as plugging a laptop into a TV.

A wrist-worn device could then serve as a mouse, allowing the user to control the virtual cursor on the display.

Dyson engineers spent three years working on Halo, only to put it aside with plans to focus on getting more market-ready goods on to the market.

The group had other inventions that never made the cut. Among them, was diesel trap for vehicle that used Dyson’s cyclone technology to capture and filter particles coming from car engines.

Another design was for a fuel cell, which would have allowed Dyson’s digital motor in its vacuums to run on hydrogen and oxygen.

The company said elements of these decades-old technologies are now being used in future research projects.
