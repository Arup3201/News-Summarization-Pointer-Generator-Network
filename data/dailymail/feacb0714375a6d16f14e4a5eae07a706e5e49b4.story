The strain was etched on Zara Phillips’s face yesterday just hours after video footage of her new husband cosying up to a pretty fan emerged.

The images, from CCTV cameras at a rowdy New Zealand bar where England rugby players partied on Sunday, clearly show captain Mike Tindall kissing the blonde and leaving with her.

It was claimed yesterday that the girl is a friend of the couple who attended their wedding. Despite desperate attempts by the England camp to play down the players’ wild night out, the leaked recording instantly became a worldwide internet sensation.

Long faces: Zara Phillips looks pained, pictured at the International Horse Trials at Watergrasshill in County Cork, Ireland. Later, however, her mood did brighten and she managed a smile

Although his behaviour was initially 
dismissed as just ‘boisterous horseplay’, Tindall, 32, can be seen 
hugging and groping the woman as they knock back shots of cheap vodka at
 the Altitude bar in Queenstown.

It had also initially been  suggested 
that the pair did not leave the bar together, but the newly released 
video also puts paid to that.

Tindall can plainly be seen taking the female partygoer by the hand and pulling her across the dancefloor towards the exit.

From that point, the colour footage 
changes to black and white film from different CCTV cameras positioned 
around the bar’s entrance.

As they stand by the doors, the pair openly cuddle before the woman pulls Tindall towards her chest and kisses his shaven head.

Outside on the street she appears to 
make several half-hearted attempts to return inside to her friends, but 
the player puts her in an affectionate headlock to prevent her from 
doing so and pulls her towards him.

The pair then walk off out of shot, 
entwined in each other’s arms. Miss Phillips, 30, continued to decline 
to comment about the scandal yesterday but friends insisted that the 
incident had ‘been blown out of all proportion’.

One source close to the Queen’s 
granddaughter, who has been married for just six weeks, claimed the 
woman was ‘a friend’ of the couple and had even been a guest at their 
wedding in July.

‘She is a friend of both Mike and Zara and has known Mike since university days,’ they said.

‘She is an English girl living in 
Australia who was at their wedding. Zara is very relaxed about all this 
and the whole thing has been blown out of all proportion.’

It is understood that Miss Phillips 
has spoken to her husband about the incident and still plans to join him
 in New Zealand, where England are competing in the Rugby World Cup, 
later this month.

Another source, who claimed to have spoken to Zara personally, claimed she had dismissed the entire furore as ‘irrelevant’.

‘She has no problem whatsoever with anything Mike has done,’  they maintained.

But as she competed at the Johnson 
& Perrott Land Rover International Horse Trials at Watergrasshill 
near Cork, Ireland, Miss Phillips, a world champion three-day eventer 
who has  hopes of representing her country in the Olympics next year, 
appeared under stress.

Newlyweds: Mike Tindall and Zara Phillips have only been married for 48 days, but he has been criticised for his 'behaviour' at a nightclub

Tindall, who captained the team in 
their unconvincing win over Argentina last Saturday but is being rested 
this weekend, was among a group of more than half a dozen internationals
 that ended up in the grimy Altitude bar following a night of heavy 
drinking.

They included fullback Ben Foden, 
whose girlfriend, Una Healy, a singer with girlband The Saturdays, 
yesterday announced she was pregnant.

The group appeared to make the most of
 the nightspot’s £2 a shot vodka promotion and posed for photographs 
with girl fans as well as several dwarfs who had been hired to 
‘entertain’ the drinkers as part of a ‘Midget Madness Weekend’ by 
running the length of the bar with a bungee rope attached to them. At an
 England team press conference yesterday, manager Martin Johnson 
continued to defend his players, Tindall in particular.

He said their antics were simply a 
case of the team ‘letting off steam’ the day after their first match, 
explaining: ‘[The] players said, “We’re going to go out for a beer on 
Sunday night” and I said, “Great idea”. You’ve got to relieve the 
pressure valve, let off steam, at the right time. In the pressure of a 
World Cup you’ve got to find those opportunities. I had no problem with 
them doing that.’

Asked whether he felt betrayed by 
their antics, he added: ‘No, I don’t. We knew the players were going to 
go out and have a few beers. People can report it how they want to 
report it. The guys are fully aware of their responsibilities. No one 
likes to be on the front page of papers but we know where the world is 
at the moment.

‘I’ve got a choice to lock them away 
and keep them out of the public in all forms or we get on and try to 
enjoy this tournament and be successful. I’d rather do that. Mike knows 
his responsibilities. He fully understands that.

‘I’ve had my arms around 50 women in 
Queenstown aged from seven months to 77. Everyone wants to get a piece 
of you and get their photograph taken with you.We either lock ourselves 
away and don’t talk to anyone or we try to enjoy the experience at the 
right time, in the right place and in the right way.

‘If you want to lead that protected 
life you can live it. It’s up to Mike what he wants to do away from 
training and playing. I’m sure,  Mike being Mike, he’ll want to get on 
with the rugby as quickly  as possible.’

Partying hard: Tindall was still wearing his morning suit the afternoon after his wedding to Zara in July

Tindall’s team-mate Chris Ashton, who 
was present in the bar, also defended their behaviour but admitted they 
needed to be ‘more careful’ in the future.

‘We had a night out and a day off. It 
does everyone a favour. It gives us all a laugh, makes everyone 
relaxed,’ he said.

‘There’s not much in it. It’s just lads having a 
night out... We genuinely don’t see anything in it. We just ended up in 
that bar – not specifically for the dwarf-racing.

‘If you have a picture with fans and 
they happen to be girls you can make anything you want with it.’ The 
players’ antics were captured on CCTV, footage of which was broadcast 
over the internet yesterday by a bouncer at the club named Jonathan 
Dixon, who claimed he was releasing it due to his disgust at Tindall’s 
behaviour.

Although he subsequently withdrew it 
after pressure from friends, he claimed in an internet video that he 
wasn’t ‘making a cent’ out of the film, adding: ‘I’m a man who feels 
very sorry for what Mike Tindall has done to the Royal Family.

‘The way he behaved is not the way 
decent people, particularly when you have been married for only a few 
weeks, behave.

'Mr Tindall, your behaviour was that of someone 
unbecoming, especially to someone such as the Queen or  Zara Phillips.’

The bar’s manager, Rich Deane, said 
Dixon’s contract has been withdrawn for releasing CCTV footage without 
permission and  the incident has been reported  to police.

Trouble ahead: Mike Tindall knows he is in for a rough time from his new wife in the next few weeks, but they are both avid party-goers who have never had drink far from their side
