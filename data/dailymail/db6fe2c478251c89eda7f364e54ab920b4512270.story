A woman desperate to have a baby lost five stone after being told she was too fat to have fertility treatment on the NHS.

Jessica Madine, from Liverpool, lost the weight in 11 months to improve her chances of having a child.

At 15st, she was classified as obese - and her doctor warned she would need a lower BMI (Body Mass Index) in order to get the  treatment.

Jessica Madine, 23, weighed 15st (left) and was told by doctors she was too fat for IVF treatment. She joined Slimming World and changed her diet of McDonald's and Subway sandwiches for salads and fruit and vegetables. She is now five stone lighter (right) and has begun fertility treatment on the NHS

So Miss Madine, who has always wanted a family of her own, decided to tackle the bulge to make it easier for her and partner, Duane Miller, to conceive.

The 23-year-old said: 'I've always wanted children, but ever since we found out it would be a struggle for us to conceive a couple of years ago it has been more important than ever.

'We went to the doctor to discuss our options and he told me I needed to get my BMI to a healthier level in order to get the treatment funded on the NHS.

'It was then that I realised I was bigger than I thought - I decided I needed to lose about four stone.'

Miss Madine, a support worker, who is 5ft 6in tall, weighed 15st 2.5lbs when she started losing weight with Slimming World in November 2013.

Her BMI of 36.1 put her in the obese category, which studies have shown makes IVF treatment more complicated and lowers the success rate. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 25.

National guidelines from health watchdog NICE say women under 40 should be offered three cycles of IVF on the NHS if they have been trying to have a baby for two years and have not been able to conceive after 12 cycles of artificial insemination.

But each local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the NHS organisation responsible for funding fertility services for the local area, can set criteria for who is eligible for IVF treatment.

St Helens CCG only offers treatment to women whose BMI is under 30.

Research has shown IVF is less successful for obese women and experts have warned being overweight is known to affect IVF conception, pregnancy and birth.

Research has shown fertility treatment is less successful for obese women and experts have warned being overweight is known to affect IVF conception, pregnancy and birth.

NHS guidelines say women with a BMI of over 30 will find it more difficult to conceive, and a study published in 2012 found having a high BMI could adversely affect the quality of women's eggs.

Healthy eggs have one spindle attached to a set of chromosomes. But the researchers found obese women were more likely to have eggs with multiple spindles and disorganised chromosomes.

A study published in November last year reiterated the findings, showing that the eggs of overweight women – who have a BMI of over 25 – were smaller and had a different biochemistry from the eggs of healthy weight women.

This jeopardises the chance of a successful pregnancy.

Royal College of Midwives advise that overweight women undergoing IVF are almost twice as likely to miscarry.

The IVF procedure itself is more difficult if the woman is overweight, according to the Advanced Fertility Centre for Chicago.

When a woman is significantly overweight, the ovaries are pushed up high, away from the top of the vagina.

This means it is more difficult to inject the needles into the follicles to get the eggs out.

Miss Madine was desperate for a baby, and so decided to transform her diet – cutting back on the McDonald's meals, Subway sandwiches or the pizza and chips she would normally opt for.

She started following a healthy meal plan including salads and lots of fruit and vegetables, as well as an exercise regime.

'I lost half a stone on my own but had struggled to motivate myself,' she said. 

'I joined Slimming World because I knew I'd stick to it if I had other people around to help.

She added: 'I was constantly snacking on the wrong food - crisps, chocolate, fizzy drinks, skipping breakfast and just generally eating rubbish.

'Now I eat three meals a day and if I'm going to have a treat I'll make sure to balance it with lots of fruit and veg.

'I did try the gym but found it wasn't for me, so I just walked the dogs twice a day instead.

On a typical day, Miss Madine now eats Weetabix or porridge for breakfast, a salad for lunch and chicken or fish with plenty of veg for dinner.

She shed almost five stone in 11 months and now weighs 10st 7lbs.

Research has shown that having a high BMI adversely affects IVF conception, pregnancy and birth. Miss Madine, pictured here before her weight loss, lost weight through changing her diet and exercise regime. 'I know it's a life changing move though, so I can't go back to my old habits,' she said

The couple have now started ICSI treatment or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection.

This is where the sperm is injected into the egg, instead of fertilisation taking place in a dish where many sperm are placed near an egg, as is the case with IVF treatment.

Miss Madine is receiving daily injections, and doctors hope to have embryos implanted within a couple of weeks.

She said: 'This means the world to us, and it's even better that both families are behind us.

'It's like a dream come true, and now we're just waiting.

'It's actually been harder keeping the weight off than losing it, so it has been a bit of a fighting game.

'I know it's a life changing move though, so I can't go back to my old habits.

'I still go to Slimming World meetings because everyone there keeps me on track and reminds me of why I did this in the first place.'
