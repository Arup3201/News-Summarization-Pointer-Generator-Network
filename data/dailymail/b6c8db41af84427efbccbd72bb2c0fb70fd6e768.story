A new exhibition will showcase the iconic poster art that has adorned the walls of the London Underground for more than a century.

Poster Art 150 - London Underground's Greatest Designs is being held at the London Transport Museum to commemorate the Tube's 150th anniversary.

Sam Mullins, Director of London Transport Museum said: ‘The posters were chosen by our panel of experts from over 3,000 in our collection and is the most comprehensive poster exhibition we have ever done.'

Away From It All by MEM Law was seen on the Tube in 1932. It is one of 150 that will be showcased as part of a new exhibition celebrating the poster art of the Underground

The exhibition, which takes place from February 15 to October 27, features art from the first graphic poster commission in 1908 to the modern day. Visitors will be invited to vote for their favourites and the most popular poster will be revealed at the end of the exhibition.

Well-known posters, including the surrealist photographer Man Ray’s ‘Keeps London Going’ pair, will feature alongside lesser-known gems. The exhibition will also offer a rare chance to view letter-press posters from the late nineteenth century.

The museum added that the London Underground was, and remains, a pioneering patron of poster art. Poster Art 150, will showcase 150 of the best designs which have been chosen by an independent panel to show the range and depth of the museum’s collection.

The exhibition will feature posters by many famous artists including Edward McKnight Kauffer and Paul Nash, and designs from each decade over the last 100 years.

Poster Art 150 is a fitting exhibition to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the world’s first underground railway, as the last major Underground poster retrospective was held in 1963 to celebrate the centenary of the Underground.

It focuses on six themes:

The Zoo By Floodlight, by Tom Eckersley and Eric Lombers, 1935

The Quickest Way To The Dogs, by Alfred Leete, 1927. The iconic Underground logo is incorporated into the design of the greyhound

Olympia Motor Show, by Andre Edouard Marty, 1933
