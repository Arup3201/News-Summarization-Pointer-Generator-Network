Ed Miliband was last night accused of risking a second invasion of the Falklands by vetoing plans for military strikes on Syria.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the Labour leader had ‘better make clear’ to the Argentinian regime that the islands would be defended if they mounted a new invasion.

Sir Malcolm, who made an impassioned speech backing the Prime Minister’s hawkish stance on Syria in Thursday’s debate, warned that Mr Cameron’s defeat could send a message of weakness to foreign powers.

‘This will not affect our determination to defend the Falklands,’ Sir Malcolm told The Mail on Sunday. ‘But that had better be made clear to the Argentinian government – especially by Mr Miliband’.

In today’s Survation poll, just over half of voters would support a British military response in the event of a second Argentinian invasion of the islands.

The Conservative statesman’s intervention comes amid increasing tension between Britain and Argentina, more than three decades after the Task Force was sent to the South Atlantic.

Last month, President Cristina Kirchner launched a new attack on British companies drilling for oil off the Falkland Islands by banning them from operating in its territory for 20 years.

Buenos Aires said four companies had been conducting ‘illegal and clandestine’ activities off the South Atlantic archipelago.

The Foreign Office criticised the move as illegal and irresponsible and described it as an attempt to intimidate legitimate commercial ventures.

The islands have been controlled by Britain since the 1830s but are claimed by Argentina as Las Malvinas.

Last night, Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, secretary of the all-party parliamentary  group on the Falklands, said the future security of the islands could have been jeopardised by Mr Cameron’s Commons defeat.

‘It is clear that Labour played politics with Syria, using it as a tool  to wound Cameron,’ he said.

‘But if it has undermined the executive’s right to take military action in the national interest without the need to consult Parliament, it could have a serious impact on  the Falklands.’
