American goalkeeper Hope Solo will go on trial in January for misdemeanor domestic violence charges, following a brawl at a family gathering this summer.

The 33-year-old, who has won two Olympic gold medals with the USA women's national team, has pleaded not guilty.

The Seattle Times reports the trial is set to begin on January 20 with Kirkland Municipal Court Judge Michael Lambo setting Solo's next court hearing for January 6.

Solo is charged with two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault stemming from a June 21 altercation with her sister and 17-year-old nephew at a family gathering. 

Lambo granted a motion for depositions of the alleged victims. Solo's attorney, Todd Maybrown, said they had previously refused to be interviewed with a court stenographer present. 

Solo's nephew told police she was upset and appeared to have been drinking when she arrived at a family gathering. Solo's lawyer has said she was a victim in the altercation. 

Solo, in court on Tuesday, has picked up 159 caps for the USA and has won two Olympic gold medals

Solo and her nephew got into a fistfight after they argued about his acting aspirations and she called him fat and crazy, according to court documents.

When the boy's mother tried to break up the confrontation, Solo punched her in the face, the documents said.

The documents said the nephew broke a broom over Solo's head and the teen pointed a broken BB gun at her and tried to get her to leave.
