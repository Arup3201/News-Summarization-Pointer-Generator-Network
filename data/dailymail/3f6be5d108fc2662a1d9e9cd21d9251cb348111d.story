A cosmetic surgeon struck off the medical register for a series of botched operations has been allowed to treat patients again while a review of his case is scheduled.

A medical tribunal found Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba was unfit to practise last December.

But the High Court has since reinstated his name on the medical register, allowing the surgeon to practise without any restrictions.

Meanwhile, judges have ordered the General Medical Council (GMC) to reinvestigate the allegations against him.

The GMC is going to the Court of Appeal to have the original decision reinstated, raising serious concerns over patient safety.

Cosmetic surgeon Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba was deemed unfit to practise and struck off the medical register in December after a medical tribunal found he left patients like Rita Nugent, above left and right, disfigured after surgery

Ms Nugent, 31, paid £2,200 for her nose job but soon realised there was a problem when her nose caved in

GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said: 'Drr Adeogba faced very serious charges which the MPTS panel found proved.

'We believe the panel's decision to stop him from practising medicine was the right one and was necessary to protect patients.

'Following a legal challenge from the doctor, the High Court referred the matter back to the panel. 

'However, we remain of the view that the original decision was correct and are now taking the case to the Court of Appeal.

'We are here to protect the public and make sure that doctors who treat patients are safe to do so.'

The decision to remove Dr Adeogba from the medical register followed an investigation into complaints from patients, left disfigured after procedures carried out by the Merseyside-based surgeon.

A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel heard one patient was left with a dented breast, and her nipples too high.

When she begged Dr Adeogba for help, he told her to wear a supportive bra.

Another patient's nipple turned black after he failed to warn her of the dangers of tissue necrosis if she continued her 12-a-day smoking habit after her operation. 

Rita Nugent, 31, ended up disfigured after paying what she thought was a bargain £2,200 for a nose job.

She said things started to go wrong almost immediately after her surgery, and by the time her wounds had healed six months later, her nose had caved in.

Dr Adeogba is now free to practise again without restriction after a High Court ruling when he appealed the decision. Judges have called for his case to be reinvestigated by the GMC

'It was like something from a horror movie,' she said. 

Dr Adeogba was employed at the private Birkdale Clinic in Crosby, Merseyside, until 2011.

Women rushed to sign up for cosmetic surgery, attracted by half-price discounts. 

The MPTS panel heard how Dr Adeogba, who passed his exams in Germany in 1979, repeatedly failed to take adequate medical histories of patients, and failed to give full information on the dangers of surgery. 

In December MPTS panel chair Dr Malcolm Philips, said: 'Dr Adeogba's standards fell below or seriously below those to be expected of a competent cosmetic surgeon. 

'The failings were wide-ranging and occured over a two-year period.

'Dr Ageogba's failings placed patients at risk of harm, some did suffer direct harm as a result of his lack of care.' 

But after being removed from the doctor's register by the MPTS, Dr Adegoba has since successfully overturned the decision in the High Court.

He is now free to practise without restriction, pending further legal challenges.  

The High Court wants the MPTS to look at Dr Adeogba's case again but a date for the hearing has yet to be set.

Until the second hearing he is back on the medical register with no conditions.  

The doctor's watchdog, the GMC, which investigates cases and brings doctors before the MPTS, is now taking the case to the Court of Appeal, to reinstate its original decision. 

The Birkdale Clinic, based in Park Road, went under the control of new management more than a year ago and renamed itself The New Birkdale Clinic.

It has no links with its predecessor.

Dr Adeogba could not be contacted for comment.
