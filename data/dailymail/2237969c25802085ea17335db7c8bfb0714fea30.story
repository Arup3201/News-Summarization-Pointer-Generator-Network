Aston Villa have allowed back-up goalkeeper Jed Steer to join Sky Bet League One club Doncaster on a three-month loan deal.

Steer joined Villa on a free transfer from Norwich last summer but, given the form of Brad Guzan, he made just three appearances, all in cup matches.

It is the third loan spell of 21-year-old Steer's career as he has previously played for Yeovil and Cambridge during his time with the Canaries.
