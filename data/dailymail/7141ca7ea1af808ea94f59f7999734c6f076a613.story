An advert for a dating website that appeared on Facebook with a picture of a woman in a school uniform has been banned for potentially encouraging grooming of young children.

Mate1.com released the advert headed 'Older Men Wanted' that read: 'Browse local singles who are looking to date older men only at Date Matures!'

An accompanying picture showed a young woman wearing what appeared to be a school uniform with the visible part of her shirt unbuttoned and her tie hanging loosely around her neck.

Actress Gemma Arterton dressed as a school girl in the film St Trinians: An online dating website has been rapped for using a model in such a uniform in an advert

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint that the ad was offensive, harmful and irresponsible for portraying the model as a school-aged child.

Mate1.com did not respond to the ASA's enquiries.

Facebook said the ad was in violation of its guidelines and had been disabled, as had any other ads using the same image. They had also issued a warning to the advertiser.

The ASA said the model would be understood by readers as being of school age due to her youthful appearance and the impression that she was wearing a school uniform.

'Irresponsible': The ASA have banned the dating website from using an advert could that they ruled could encourage 'grooming' of young children

It said: 'In the context of the other claims in the ad - 'Older Men Wanted', 'datemature.com' and 'browse local singles who are looking to date older men Only at Date Matures!', and the fact that the ad appeared on a social networking site - we considered that the image was irresponsible because it could be understood as an allusion to, and encouragement of, the so-called 'grooming' of young children.

'For these same reasons we considered that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence.'

It added: 'Although the ad appeared to be targeting 'older men', we considered the implication that young children could also join the dating service, in order to meet older men, was a breach of the code rules.'

It ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form.
