Hundreds of British holidaymakers at a five-star Turkish hotel have been hit by an outbreak of severe food poisoning.

Guests at the all-inclusive Sentido Perissia Hotel in Side, which is used by Thomas Cook, have been confined to their rooms.

Thomas Cook has now suspended holidays at the hotel following the suspected outbreak of norovirus.

Diane Blumsom, 45, from Clacton, Essex, was hospitalised in Turkey after being struck down by the illness.

She paid £1,300 to fly herself and her daughters Sian, 18, and nine-year-old Jane, home.

Miss Blumsom, who was on holiday with a party of 20 people, had paid £5,412 for her two-week break. Last night she said: ‘It really was the holiday from hell. Seven members of the group have been hospitalised over the last nine days.

‘This place was meant to be a five-star resort but we all asked Thomas Cook to fly us home because we were so ill we couldn’t use the facilities, but they refused.

‘We arrived on Saturday August 10 and within two days our party were being struck down by severe sickness. My daughter Jane, who is nine, had projectile vomiting so severe it was like something out of The Exorcist.

'At one point the staff decided they didn’t want the ambulance to keep coming to the hotel so they insisted that people had to get taxis there instead.’

Staff closed down the swimming pool for two days last week as they tried to deal with the outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea.

Guest David Corran, 28, who was also staying at the hotel with the party of 20, including his girlfriend Jade Bundy, 22, fell ill within two days of arriving at the hotel.

‘We have been trying to think what we might have eaten but we don’t know,’ he said. ‘It could have been the salad and some thought it might be the water they use to wash the salad.

‘When we complained about falling ill the rep blamed it on the English and said we had too much sun.’

Thomas Cook have now flown out hygiene experts to investigate and have been sending guests with bookings to different resorts.

A company spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that a number of customers staying at the Sentido Perissia, Turkey, have recently reported a stomach upset lasting 24 to 48 hours.

Preliminary indications suggest that this is of a viral nature, and we have been working closely with the hotel to understand the cause of the problem.

‘The health and well-being of our customers is our top priority and we take all reports of illness very seriously. We immediately arranged for an independent UK hygiene consultant to carry out a comprehensive review of the hotel and the cause is believed to be viral.

‘The hotel has put in place a number of preventative measures to minimise any further illness.

‘Our team in resort are providing assistance to our guests and we will continue to closely monitor the situation.’
