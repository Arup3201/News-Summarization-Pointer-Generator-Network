Adil Hussain was sentenced to three years in prison today after taking miles off used cars and selling them for more than they were worth

A car dealer who tricked customers into overpaying for vehicles by reducing their mileage has been jailed for three years.

Adil Hussain pocketed over £100,000 by fiddling with the cars' odometers before selling them at premium rates to unwitting customers.

The 26-year-old from Lenton, Nottinghamshire, was reported to Trading Standards after one woman realised she had been duped out of thousands of pounds.

Nottingham Crown Court heard how the man bought cars at auctions and from private sellers before rigging their odometers and selling them on Autotrader.

Over 18-months, Hussain raked in £133,200 by fraudulently selling 74 used cars online.

He was finally exposed when hairdresser, Caroline Jones, discovered she had been scammed after part-exchanging her Honda RS3200 for a Toyota Celica.

'I was forced to downsize my car to save money because the recession really hit my business,' she said.

'I looked on Autotrader and Adil Hussain was advertising himself as a car dealer. 

'I saw he was advertising a 2005 Toyota Celica with 48,431 miles on the clock for £6,000.

'He offered me £4,000 for my car so I paid him £2,000 cash.

'I went to look at the car and he provided all the documents and service history which tallied with the mileage of this car.

'We agreed a price and he dropped the car off but almost immediately after I handed over the money I realised something was wrong because the car wouldn't start.

'The gearbox was completely shot and when I held up the service book to the light I noticed a sticker was covering the front which said Toyota Diesel.

A Toyota Celica which was purchased by Caroline Jones had only 48,00 miles on the clock when it should have read over 100,000 miles

'Everything clicked and I realised he had given me the service book from another car.

'I could just see him driving away in my car and tried to ring him on his mobile but it was already disconnected.

'I rang the police but they couldn’t help so I got straight on the phone to Trading Standards and reported him.

'I did my own research on Adil Hussain and there were lots of people saying he had conned them.

'The car I bought from him had actually done 100,000 miles and the rear wheel was hanging on by a single bolt. It could have killed me.

'Because I needed a car for my business I ended up paying £3,000 to have it repaired before I just sold it for a banger because the memory of what he did was too much for me.

'I am glad he was jailed but I don’t know if I will get my money back. I borrowed the money from my husband which now means he has to work more so we can pay it off.'

Hussain was ordered to repay his customers £390,000, the value of the 74 cars he 'clocked'.

Judge Andrew Hamilton said: 'You effectively stole from your victims. Because of the high mileage the cars had travelled they could be potentially dangerous.'

His cousin, Ayaz Aziz, 27, also of Nottingham, received a 14 month prison sentence suspended for two years.

Aziz was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.
