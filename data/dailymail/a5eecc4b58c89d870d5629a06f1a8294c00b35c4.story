Grim discovery: Chief executive Carsten Schloter, 49, was found dead in what police are treating as a suicide

The boss of telecoms giant  Swisscom was 'dangerously addicted to his smartphone' after the breakdown of his marriage it has been claimed.

Chief executive Carsten Schloter, was found dead in what police are treating as a suicide.

The state-controlled firm, which dominates the Swiss market, said it was ‘in mourning’, after Schloter, 49, was found dead by police in his home near the city of Freiburg.

Police are assuming the cause of death was suicide, although the company said that ‘an investigation into the exact circumstances is underway’.

Schloter was known as a 
workaholic who admitted in interviews that he found it impossible to 
turn off his mobile phone and sometimes struggled to reduce the tempo of
his busy life.

The German-born boss separated from his wife in 2009 and lived apart from his three children.

He later told Swiss newspaper Blick 
that he had tried to ‘play the strong man’ over the separation but that 
this was ‘not credible’.

Excerpts from interviews Mr Schloter gave to the Swiss media this year and in 2012 were published in Switzerland's Handelszeitung newspaper yesterday and may show his state of mind.

'Modern communications devices have their downside,' Mr Schloter told Switzerland's Schweiz am Sonntag in May, reported The Independent. 

The most dangerous thing is to fall into a mode of permanent activity and continuously consult one's smartphone to see whether any new mails have come in. Everyone should switch off their mobile phone from time to time.'

Mr Schloter insisted that staff use the more 
personal ‘Du’ form of address when speaking to one another, as opposed 
to the formal ‘Sie’ form common in the business world.

Tribute on Swisscom website: The news has rocked the Swiss business community, where Schloter was known for his modern and innovative approach to business, as well as his love of outdoor sports

The news has rocked the Swiss business 
community, where Schloter was known for his modern and innovative 
approach to business, as well as his love of outdoor sports.

Swisscom chairman Hansueli Loosli said: ‘The board of directors, group executive board and the entire workforce are deeply saddened and pass on their condolences to the family and relatives.’

Swisscom’s performance under Schloter was considered strong despite small declines in revenue. But the company, which has 62 per cent of Switzerland’s mobile market and 55 per cent of broadband, had recently come under pressure from competition watchdogs.

Weko, the Swiss equivalent of the UK’s Competition Commission, last week opened an investigation after rival Sunrise complained that Swisscom was abusing its dominant position in broadband internet for corporate clients.

Schloter’s death is the third suicide by an executive at a leading Swiss firm in the space of five years. In 2008 the chief executive of private bank Julius Baer Alex Widmer took his own life, followed in 2011 by Adrian Kohler, the boss of Ricola, who threw himself in front of a train.
