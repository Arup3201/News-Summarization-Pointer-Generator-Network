The demand on the NHS is 'greater than ever before' as it emerged 900 more patients are being admitted to hospital every day compared with a year ago.

New figures published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveal NHS hospitals in England dealt with 15.5 million admissions in 2013-14.

That figure equates to 42,400 patients being admitted each day - 870 more on average than the previous year.

Those aged 65 to 69 were most likely to be admitted to hospital, and the age group saw the greatest increase in admissions, up 66,000 from the previous year to 1.3 million.

Falls accounted for 421,800 admissions, an increase of 11,000 from 2012-13, with patients aged over 65 most likely to suffer a fall.

Meanwhile women were more likely to be admitted for treatment, making up 56 per cent of admissions.

Of the total admissions, 5.4 million were emergencies, up from 5.3 million the previous year. 

Experts warned the demand being placed on the health service is unprecedented, with more older people needing care. 

Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: 'The rising numbers of older people being admitted to hospital is a wake- up call that social care is in crisis and that we're not doing enough to keep older people well at home. 

'Without good social care to sustain them in living independently, older people are more likely to end up in hospital.

She added: 'Falls are a serious threat to older people's health, wellbeing and independence, causing pain, distress and loss of confidence. 

'However, despite having serious consequences, falls in later life are often dismissed as an inevitable part of growing older, when the reality is that they are usually preventable.

'Properly funded social care would make a huge difference to people's lives, helping to keep them well and ultimately saving money in the NHS.

'Hospitals can work better for everyone if we do more to prevent the need for older people to be admitted in the first place, as well as making sure that when people do need inpatient care, they are supported to get home as quickly as possible.'

Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents more than 500 NHS organisations, said: 'Pressures on the health and care system have never been greater.

NHS Confederation chief executive Rob Webster said: 'To improve care and tackle these pressures we need to radically reshape services around people's needs and aspirations'

'To improve care and tackle these pressures we need to radically reshape services around people's needs and aspirations.'

To do that the Confederation and 23 organisations, which include leading charities and various medical Royal College, are urging all political parties to focus on four key healthcare issues in the run up to the election.

A 12-page document, The 2015 Challenge: Our Prescription For The Election highlights the importance of political leadership alongside health and care leadership in helping secure change.

It calls for politicians to: 

Mr Webster, said: 'We will only succeed in this task if the next Government and national arms-length bodies put in place the right conditions for our members to succeed. 

The significant steps towards this by national bodies and the political parties in recent months are very welcome, but given the huge scale of the challenges more progress is urgently needed.

'Many politicians have talked about the kind of changes to care we set out in the 2015 Challenge, for example, more supported self-care programmes and care being offered in places other than hospitals with health and care professionals working in different ways with patients and families. 

'As the election approaches, we now need all candidates to play their part in a constructive debate about how to ensure health and care services are sustainable and deliver the best possible outcomes for people. 

'If necessary change is blocked, the funding gap will increase and people's care will suffer.

'We also need honesty about the resources needed. The Five Year Forward View gives a start by saying the NHS will need at least £8 billion extra as well as funding earmarked for changing services. 

'This must be matched by adequate social care funding and the reform which is needed to free up £22 billion of efficiencies, otherwise the whole system could become unsustainable.' 

Hospitals in England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for five months running.

The latest set of figures, published today, reveal the misery for patients is ongoing, with no sign of the mounting pressure on medical staff abating.

NHS England said 91.6 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival in A&E to being admitted to hospital, transferred or discharged.

The figures reveal performance for the week ending February 15 and is down from 92.9 per cent the previous week - short of the 95 per cent target.

The damning statistics mark the 20th consecutive week that the A&E target has been missed. 

Dr Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, said: 'Last week saw a sharp increase in A&E attendances and emergency admissions - up by nearly 15,000 on the week before.

'These are the highest levels since Christmas and are also up on the same week last year.

Hospitals across England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for the last 20 weeks

'This has resulted in a slight impact on waiting times, but we continue to admit, treat and discharge more than nine out of 10 patients within four hours. 

It comes as A&E waiting times in England plummeted to the lowest level in a decade, a reflection of the growing 'crisis' in the NHS.

Figures reveal from October to December, 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target.

The latest performance marks the worst quarterly results since the target was introduced at the end of 2004.

It comes as hospitals across the country face exceptional demand and unprecedented pressures.

Ten hospitals have declared 'major incidents' – an emergency trigger usually reserved for air crashes or terror attacks.

Emergency plans have been implemented, including calling in extra staff and cancelling non-emergency care, including routine operations.

The Government today admitted the figures were 'disappointing' - and conceded there is a 'huge amount of pressure' on the health service.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said hospital bosses feel they are 'running just to keep still' to cope with rising demand.

Prime Minister David Cameron said much of the pressure on emergency departments comes as society faces an ageing population, with more frail, elderly people.

But he insisted that around 2,500 more patients were being seen within four hours every day than four years ago.
