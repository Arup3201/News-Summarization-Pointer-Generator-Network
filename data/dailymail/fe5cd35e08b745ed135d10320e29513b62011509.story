With two failed marriages and a legion of lovers behind her, you could forgive Madonna for being something of a cynic in matters of the heart.

But the singer yesterday admitted that she was still a romantic and hoped one day to be ‘swept away by a knight in shining armour’.

She also revealed that despite the  breakdown of her marriages to actor Sean Penn and director Guy Ritchie she would wed again – if asked.

The 53-year-old was speaking to chat show host Graham Norton before the  premiere of her new film, WE.

Madonna, who directed the movie about the love affair between Wallis Simpson  and King Edward VIII, chose a classic  black velvet strapless gown and lace cape for last night’s red carpet appearance  at the Odeon cinema in Kensington,  West London.

And although the Material Girl would  easily pass for a woman 15 years younger, she gave a few clues to her real age by  covering her tell-tale wrinkly hands with a pair of bright red leather gloves.

The mother of four, who arrived with her dancer boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, who at 24 is 29 years her junior, had earlier told Norton: ‘If you’re a romantic like me, and every girl I know is, every girl wants to be swept off her feet by a knight in shining armour. Unfortunately we’re raised on those fairy tales.

‘Even if we are sophisticated, 
educated, intelligent, evolved human beings, we like to think in the 
back of our minds that Mr Right is going to sweep us off our feet and 
take us into the sunset, and we’re going to live happily ever after.

‘But we keep getting disappointed. If  you have even half a brain you know that doesn’t exist.’

When asked if she could see herself walking down the aisle again, Madonna, who has dated a number of high-profile men including John F Kennedy Jnr, replied: ‘I could actually, yes.

‘I think I’m a pretty good judge of character but I have made a few mistakes.’

The singer divorced Ritchie, 43, after eight years of marriage in 2008. He is  dating model Jacqui Ainsley and the couple had a baby son in September.

While recording an interview for the 
Irish presenter’s BBC show, to be shown tomorrow night, Madonna also 
revealed that she was just like every other harassed mother of 
teenagers.

She told how her 15-year-old daughter Lourdes raids her wardrobe to steal her clothes and often shows her ‘no respect’.

She said: ‘She is 15 but she’s very sophisticated for her age. I don’t even have to ask and she gives me her opinion.

'I play her songs and say “what do you think. Like it, don’t like it? Cool, uncool?” She’s very opinionated.

‘If
I say to my daughter “that outfit is a little bit too risqué”, my 
daughter will look at me and say,  “that’s rich coming from you”.

‘And she borrows my clothes a lot. She’s always sneaking into my room at six in the morning when I’m sleeping.

'She loves these combat boots that I wear. Maybe she loans them to her friends because I don’t see them for weeks.

‘She doesn’t like the fact she still has a nanny, but I have four kids so I need someone to look after them.

‘My
nanny said “You’ve got to give your mum her boots back”. She said, 
“whatever, she’ll get over it”. I was thinking, “Wow, she doesn’t hear 
me at all”. I don’t care about the boots, it’s her attitude.’

Of
her other three children – Rocco, 11, David, six, and daughter Mercy, 
also six, Madonna added: ‘When I’m at home with my children .... I hear 
all the complaints and all the moaning, and I still have to threaten to 
kill them if they won’t do their homework.’

Also today, Madonna took time to pose 
with her co-stars for the W.E. London photocall, ahead of her red carpet
premiere in Kensington High Street.

The Material Girl teamed an elegant 
curve-hugging navy dress with fingerless biker gloves - although of 
course they were emblazoned with large diamante Coco Chanel emblems.

She showed off her slender 
physique in the tailored frock, that daringly gaped at the cleavage to 
show a hint of black lace beneath.

Her
trademark blonde tresses hung loosely around her shoulders, with the 
Queen of Pop opting for neutral make-up to emulate an natural, 
just-going-about-my-daily-business look.

Madonna
spiced up the outfit with fishnets and black patent peep-toe heels; 
together with several chunky accessories including a large silver 
bracelet and a watch.

To coincide with tonight's premiere, the Golden Globe-winner has also announced the title of her 12th studio album is MDNA and that she will be going on tour again.

During the interview with Norton, she said: 'I just have to pay the rent. A girl has to make a living, but truthfully I do enjoy it. Touring is the most rewarding of all my jobs.'

The release of the new record has been tainted slightly by the leak of an early version of the first single, Gimme All Your Luvin' in November 2010, for which a Spanish man was arrested in December.

Referring to the incident, Madonna joked: 'It's soon (the release date). It depends how quickly people hack in to my server and leak it. Can people wait? It's terrible.'
