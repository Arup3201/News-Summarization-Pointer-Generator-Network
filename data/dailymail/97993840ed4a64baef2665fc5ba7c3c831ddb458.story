As my stepfather put the shepherd’s pie on the table, the pride on his face was palpable. ‘I’ve been working on this recipe for decades,’ he announced. ‘And I’ve finally perfected it.’

My reaction was not what he’d hoped for. After just one forkful, I groaned, sprinted through the back door and vomited in a flowerbed.

But this was no reflection on the meal. It was my response to almost all food, leaving me starving and lethargic — and at a time when I needed my energy most.

Torture: Jennifer with her husband Richard and children James and Jessica. Both proved difficult pregnancies

For I was pregnant, and suffering the extreme morning sickness that blighted both my pregnancies and has afflicted Kate Middleton — though the generic, ubiquitous term ‘morning sickness’ little reflects the unending, inescapable nausea and vomiting I suffered every day.

Throughout the 18 long, terrible months I carried my children I did not live, I merely existed, sick and exhausted, waiting for my sentence to be served. It was so severe, and so much worse with my second pregnancy, that it destroyed me both physically and mentally. It meant I was even forced to forgo my hopes of another child.

This torture is, I fear, the fate awaiting the Duchess of Cambridge as she embarks on her own second pregnancy, having once again been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum.

It is a strangely flowery title for such a vile condition. For those who wonder what it feels like, I would compare it to having food poisoning every day for nine months solid.

Of course, there are times when it eases off, briefly, or sufferers would be hospitalised throughout. But in my 42 years on earth nothing has been harder than living with hyperemesis gravidarum. It even made the pain of childbirth come as a relief.

It is the sole reason my husband and I decided not to have any more children. We would have loved more — Richard is one of three and we both wanted a brother or sister for Jessica, eight, and James, six — but the prospect of going through nine months of hell again was beyond me.

It didn’t start out like this, of course. When we married in 2005, Richard and I were keen to have lots of children and we didn’t have to wait long. Jess was a honeymoon baby and the miracle of a tiny new life growing inside me was so exciting it carried me through a tough pregnancy.

For reasons unknown, my sickness tended to come on in the afternoons, so the mornings weren’t too bad. But as the day wore on, I would become exhausted — and by the time Richard came home in the evenings, I would be lying on the sofa groaning, with a washing up bowl on standby for when I couldn’t reach the bathroom.

Still, at least I had the freedom to sleep when I needed and had no responsibility to anyone except myself. Doctors prescribed medication, none of which made the slightest difference, so I soldiered on until Jess came along and gave me no time to think of anything, or anyone else.

Relief: The Royal couple with Prince George, who was born after Kate experienced severe morning sickness

Yet while that pregnancy was difficult, it was as nothing compared to my second, with James.

Ironically, we were hopeful that history would not repeat itself and this would prove an easier ride. But when I became pregnant again, when Jess was just one, we realised immediately that this time around would be infinitely worse.

Not only did I have the extreme sickness and the unborn baby to think about, I also had a lively, inquisitive little child who needed my attention at all times and required round-the-clock care. The experience nearly broke me. The sickness was even worse this time, too. Whereas in the first pregnancy it came and went, easing off slightly by the third trimester, now it was a near-constant companion.

I felt so sick the weight dropped off me. While mothers are supposed to gain weight throughout the pregnancy, as they store the reserves to feed their baby, I lost it: at seven months, I weighed half a stone less than I did before I got pregnant.

I remember my mother looking at me one day, concern in her eyes, and saying my face looked ‘gaunt’. I ate a tub of ice cream every night, as it was the only thing I could stomach.

Doctors juggled prescriptions in an attempt to ease the symptoms, to no avail. At one point they suggested hospitalising me under a consultant’s care, for an intravenous drug, but said they couldn’t guarantee there wouldn’t be risks to my baby. I was desperate for help, but on hearing those words I declined.

Yet the impact ran far deeper than the physical symptoms. It had a deep psychological impact which we are still, to a degree, dealing with today.

I developed a phobia of speaking on the phone because I was petrified of throwing up mid call. I felt stressed and unhappy, and as the pregnancy wore on my mood got only lower.

Friends would try to lift my spirits by saying it would pass, but after five months of sickness I knew in my bones it wasn’t going to end until the baby was born. Life was miserable.

As the pregnancy wore on we had to hire a nanny to look after Jess in the afternoons, as I was incapable of anything more strenuous than fitful sleep. I felt terrible guilt both for the damage I was doing to my unborn child and also to my daughter, who couldn’t understand why her mother kept disappearing.

I was ashamed of it at the time — and to this day I feel awful for having ever uttered these words — but the nadir came at seven months when I tearfully blurted out to my husband: ‘I just want this thing to die so it will stop.’

We were both shocked and distraught by my outburst. It is an unspeakably terrible thing to resent your unborn baby, but I wasn’t in my right mind at the time.

Months of relentless sickness had, in the bleak moment of that 3am outcry, driven me to the brink of madness. I spoke to my doctor again and started seeing a counsellor, which helped me stay sane in those final two months.

The birth came as an utter relief to both of us. Finally the sickness ended. James was, and remains, utterly gorgeous, and he and Jessica are the light of our lives.

But the difficulties were not extinguished with his arrival. For nine months of sickness had left me at my lowest ebb, both psychologically and physically, and when I gave birth I was utterly spent.

More confident: Jennifer with her family today

Just at the time when I needed all my strength to care for twice as many children, the well was dry. It is hardly surprising that I went on to develop post-natal depression and I would be astonished if Kate has not experienced something similar.

I feel terribly sad that I was unable to enjoy the earliest days of my children’s lives. Since they came along I have put work aside and given my life to them, staying at home as a full-time mum. They make me laugh every day and I cannot imagine life without them, but in the aftermath of my pregnancies the world was a very bleak place.

Over time I recovered and there have, thank goodness, been no ill-effects for the children. They are thriving at school, Jess is already a budding actress and James is never without a football at his feet.

But there is one lasting legacy of my morning sickness which will never go away: the fact that we were unable to have any more children.

For during the dark times we went through in that second pregnancy, we both agreed we could never subject ourselves, or our children, to that again. I don’t think my body or mind could withstand another torment.

Yet I have lost count of the number of occasions a newborn has tugged at my heart strings and made me madly broody. While we do not talk about it often, I know Richard feels the same.

He is perhaps not as dotty about the nappy changing stage (few men are), but I know he always wanted a bigger family and we often reminisce about what Jess and James were like as toddlers — the silly words, the quirky mannerisms and just how tiny they were.

There has been an odd occasion on which we have had a pregnancy scare, raising the awful question of what we would do. Thankfully they were false alarms, so we have never had to make the choice, but the fear of what might happen is all too real.

People have said to me that it is ‘only nine months’, but that is a lifetime when you are seriously ill. Psychologically it was incredibly trying — I was in therapy because I felt so trapped and awful.

Yet the ache for another sought-for child never quite goes away. It is stronger than ever right now, as our children are growing up so fast and James, my lovely baby boy, is at the age where he refuses a kiss in public.

I long to hold another baby in my arms. But having another is out of the question and I do feel extremely lucky to have had two healthy children.

Thankfully for Kate, she has all the support money can buy. She will have staff who can cook, clean and look after George, not to mention the best doctors in the country on hand to ensure the new child is born strong and well.

Am I jealous that she has greater support? Knowing what she is suffering right now, there is nobody I would less like to be.
