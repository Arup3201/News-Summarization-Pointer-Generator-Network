Most people look forward to Christmas, but one woman is left with an impending sense doom as the festive season approaches.

Stefanie Howlett, 28, has developed an overwhelming phobia of Father Christmas after being dragged by her parents to sit on his lap every year as a child.

Her terror has become so intense that she cannot be in the same building as a Santa and, if she knows there’s one nearby, she instantly bursts into tears.

Ms Howlett, from Wirral, Merseyside, is even unable to watch TV for fear the Coca-Cola Christmas advert will come on.

She said: ‘He absolutely terrifies me but I can’t work out exactly why. Whenever I see him it brings on a panic attack.

‘I went on a Christmas coach trip two years ago and we went to a Santa’s Grotto in Norway.

‘When we were told we were going to go in and meet Santa just knowing he was in the next room brought on a panic attack.

‘I burst into tears and couldn’t go in the room - I could barely stay in the building.

‘I’ll run away and cry and nobody can calm me down - I can’t even look at him.

Fear: Ms Howlett (pictured with Father Christmas as a child) is so scared of Santa she is unable to be in a building with one and she bursts into tears at the sight of him

Ms Howlett says she developed the phobia after her parents dragged her to see Santa each Christmas when she was a child and forced her to sit on his knee

She said: 'He absolutely terrifies me but I can't work out why. Whenever I see him it brings on a panic attack'

‘In childhood pictures of me with Santa you can see the fear in my eyes and I wouldn’t stop crying until I was taken away.’

The phobia is common in young children but is typically left behind in adulthood.

However, the jewellery designer has not been able to shake her irrational fear.

She cannot watch Christmas films and even the thought of the man in red makes her cringe and squirm.

She said: ‘Christmas films with Santa in terrify me - it’s like somebody else watching a horror film - I start to get palpitations and panic.

‘Everyone thinks it is hilarious but it’s a real phobia for me.’

Ms Howlett has to do all of her Christmas shopping online so as to avoid seeing Father Christmas

Ms Howlett’s fear means she has to do all of her Christmas shopping online to avoid catching a glimpse of Father Christmas.

She said: ‘To avoid seeing him I’ll find out where he’s going to be and I’ll avoid those places like the plague.

‘But people will laugh while I’m in horror that there’s a man dressed as Santa close to me.

‘I can’t even bear to have old style Christmas cards with the creepy Santa on in my house. If somebody sends me one, it goes straight in the bin.

‘I feel sorry for any children I’ll have because I’ll never be taking them to visit Santa’s Grotto.’
