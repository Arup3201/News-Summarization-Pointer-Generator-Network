Britain's icy blast of wintry weather will melt away to more balmy conditions today with temperatures rocketing into double figures.

Much of the UK was covered with a thick blanket of snow yesterday as a weather system from the Atlantic brought in up to 6in (15cm) in places.

The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for much of Scotland and northern England for, advising people to be careful in the icy conditions and low temperatures.

Many roads were impassable as winter 
bites Britain yet again, while a number of crashes occurred in Scotland 
and the North due to the icy conditions.

But after yesterday's snowfall the UK will see much milder weather today, forecasters said.

The mercury could rise as high as 12C 
(54F) in the South West, 11C (52F) in London and 9C (48F) in the North, 
the Midlands and Scotland.

There will be no more snow this week, 
but instead dry, sunny weather, according to Sally Webb, a forecaster 
with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association.

'Heavy rain falling across much of 
England and Wales this morning will clear through the South East around 
noon, leaving a largely dry and sunny day,' she said.

'There will be isolated showers along western fringes, particularly in Scotland.

'It will stay dry overnight, with 
clear spells and widespread frost, and temperatures getting down to 0C 
in most places, and minus 2C (28.5F) in places like Cheshire.

'Tomorrow there will be sunny spells, 
though Scotland is still likely to see some showers overnight into 
Saturday, but elsewhere it will be largely dry and sunny throughout the 
weekend.

'Temperatures are going to stay fairly
mild, with 10C (50F) or 11C (52F) in western areas, 8C (46.5F) or 9C 
(48F) in other areas and into next week.'

But the warmer weather may just be a blip - forecasters suggest it will become cold again at the end of next week.

The Environment Agency has eight flood
warnings in place - three in the Midlands, three in East Anglia and two
in the South West, and 132 less serious flood alerts, mainly in the 
South East.

However, forecasters say there is further proof that spring could
still be a long way off as forecasters warn Britain faces another month
of Arctic conditions.

The snow is caused by a band of rain moving in from the Atlantic early today will turn into snow across much of England and 
Scotland.

Nick Prebble, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'There will be snow across much of England and 
Scotland, and it will settle through the Midlands, the North and 
Scotland.

'The Midlands will see up to 4cm (1.6in), further north in England will 
have up to 6cm (2.4in) while lower ground in Scotland could have 8cm 
(3.2cm). But on higher ground that is likely to be more than 10cm (4in),
possibly up to 15cm (6in), with significant falls of snow.'

But the freeze is likely to be short lived, and the snow will thaw and 
melt away overnight as milder air comes in from the west, Mr 
Prebble said, paving the way for dry, sunny spells until Friday.

On Monday the heaviest snowfall was 
in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire with nearly 5inches - 12cms - falling
overnight while much of London and the south-east saw several 
centimetres overnight.
