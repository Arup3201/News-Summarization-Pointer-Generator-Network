From smart glasses and invisibility cloaks to hover bikes in Star Wars, a lot of futuristic innovations dreamed up in sci-fi novels now exist.

And while these gadgets might be cool, a study has revealed that people would most like to see medicine that can cure all illnesses developed in the next 100 years.

Humans are also keen to let robots take care of mundane daily tasks, with wrinkle-free clothes and a robot that does the housework among the top five ‘dreams for the future.’

Two thirds of those polled hope for a cure-all pill above all over possible innovations, according to the survey of 1,000 people for Philips.

One in five people claim that they would give up their computer, TV or headphones in order to see more health-related innovations.

Almost two per cent of people would like to see robots doing the housework or a time machine developed in the next century, while a fifth of those surveyed simply want a cure for baldness.

Self-driving cars are also among the inventions that are in demand and these are already being tested. Both Google and BMW are refining their innovations and a pilot scheme is taking place in Milton Keynes in 2017 to test a network of 100 futuristic driverless 'pods'.

The study also polled people on what they thought were the top inventions of the past century.

The internet and world wide web came top with over half of Britons considering it to be the most important innovation in the last 100 years. The string of intentions that make up the internet saw five of its founding fathers win the first Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering last year.

Among the top five inventions were two health breakthroughs, with 40 per cent of Britons placing the most importance on keyhole surgery and 33 per cent on the pacemaker, which have transformed millions of lives.

Easy rider: The licences only apply to employees of autonomous vehicle manufacturers  and say that a car 'needs to be insured for at least $5,000,000 against personal injury, death, or property damage.' The rules state that test drivers must sit in the driver seat (pictured)and be capable of immediately taking control of the vehicle

‘Surprisingly, only a quarter of respondents to the poll said that smartphones were the most meaningful innovations of the last century, while innovations that improved their health, well-being and sense of security were the ones to top the list,’ cyber-psychologist, Jacqui Taylor said.

‘The British still love technology that keeps them connected with each other, but there is a greater demand for innovation that has a positive impact on their home and family life. They want innovations to understand and address their deeper human needs.’

Consumer electronics such as mobile phones and television formed the final two inventions of the top five breakthroughs of the past century, while people are raising their expectation in the next 100 years, with just under a third of Britons keen to make use of a time machine.

Wander Bruijel, head of brand at Philips UK and Ireland, said: 'Technology that keeps us connected has fundamentally changed the way we live, work and interact with one another.

‘But as some key societal trends and challenges catch up to us – such as an ageing population, a pressure on our environment, and a desire to live more happily and healthily – it’s not surprising that we are looking for innovative solutions that address those more meaningful concerns.’
