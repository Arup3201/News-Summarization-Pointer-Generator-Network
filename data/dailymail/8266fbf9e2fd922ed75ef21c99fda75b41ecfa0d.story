The last of the iconic Catskills resorts like the one featured in the 1980s hit Dirty Dancing has been sold to a company that plans to turn the property into a healthy living resort.

Sullivan County economic development officials confirmed that the sale of Kutsher's Country Club was finalized Wednesday.

The buyer, Veria Lifestyle, plans to transform the 1,300-acre New York state property into a $90 million destination offering yoga, golf, tennis and other healthy activities.

During its heyday, the resort located 75 miles northwest of New York City was one of the most famous of the 'Borscht Belt' hotels in the Catskills when the region attracted largely Jewish families who headed upstate to escape the summer heat.

Owned for decades by the Kutsher family, the century-old resort hosted entertainers such as Tony Bennett, Milton Berle and Jerry Seinfeld.

Muhammad Ali even trained at Kutsherâ€™s, as did other world boxing champions, such as Floyd Patterson and Leon Spinks.

Complete with manmade and natural lakes, condos, bungalows, an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, an ice-skating rink and summer camps, the resort's buildings are set to be demolished and replaced with buildings that will house 'yoga sciences,' 'ayurvedic medical treatment,' and 'biodynamic restaurants.'

Max and Louis Kutsher opened the Kutsher's Brothers Farm House in 1907 and expanded the property in the 1920s and 1930s.

Milton Kutsher oversaw the hotel's growth between the 1950s and the 1980s, the Catskills pinnacle, when the region was a summertime destination for Jewish families from New York City.

Milton Kutsher and his wife Helen ran the hotel until his death in 1998, when son Mark Kutsher took over.

According to the Record Online, most recently the hotel has been branded as The New Kutsher's Resort and leased to Yossi Zablocki.

Over the past few years it has hosted festivals including the New York Harvest Festival and All Tomorrow's Parties.

Tragically, a young woman working for the 17th Annual Harvest and Freedom Festival fell to her death from a condemned building at Kutsher's in October.

Last month, voters in New York State authorized casinos as a tool to reinvigorate the decaying Catskill resorts, but as yet the area remains neglected.
