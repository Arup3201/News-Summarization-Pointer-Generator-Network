If you are an ardent One Direction - or if you have one in your family - you will likely have bought the CDs, the posters, the sticker books and the T-shirts... but the glasses?

In proof that there really are no limits to the merchandise they can peddle to their fans, the 1D boys have released a collection of glasses in association with Vision Express.

Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson are not known to wear spectacles themselves - but nevertherless have been deemed qualified to design a range of girls' glasses for the High Street optician.

Merchandised to the max: The One Direction boys have put their name to a range of girls' glasses, currently on sale at Vision Express

Signed: The 'Niall' is a pair of purple and violet glasses printed with the autographs of the 1D band members

One for the fans: The glasses bear the name of the band with a picture of a heart alongside. This style is called Little Things after one of the boys' hit songs

The glasses, which retail at £131 (£40 if you have an NHS voucher) come in seven different styles and are named after band members - Niall has two different frames named after him - or 1D song names, with the band's tracks One Thing, Little Things and Young used as names for three of the styles.

One of the styles is named Mullingar, after Niall Horan's hometown in County Westmeath, Ireland.

The range, aimed at girls from age six to 11, comes in standard black or brown, with a splash of colour provided by a lavender pair - and some bear the boys' autographs.

On their website, Vision Express call the glasses a 'highlight', saying: 'Million-selling British boyband One Direction have released their latest merchandise - an exclusive range of girls frames.'

Tribute: The Mullingar, named after Niall Horan's hometown in County Westmeath, Ireland

Variety: The red Young frame, named after another of the band's hits

'Highlight': The glasses are available to buy at local Vision Express stores but are advertised on the shop's website for fans to pick their favourite (sadly without the styles' real names)
