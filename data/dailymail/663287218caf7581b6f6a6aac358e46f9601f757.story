Tiny and innocent, little Danica May Camacho peers out at the world just moments after her birth at a hospital in the Philippines.

However, Danica's birth is not only significant to mother Camille and father Florante. She is one of the world's symbolic seven billionth occupants.

But, despite being officially awarded the title, claims are being made in other countries that their newly-born babies are the seventh billion newborn on the planet.

Something to celebrate: Proud father Florante Galura holds a cake marking the significance of his daughter's birth

In London a baby boy born at St Thomas's hospital was being hailed the seventh billion child and was presented with a House of Commons teddy 
bear by Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Tonge, Conservative MP 
Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and hospital staff just three hours after his 
birth.

Weighing just three when he was delivered, the boy who has tentatively been named Peter Bashir Yansaneh by his father Amara Yansaneh and mother Yasmin Karim.

But Peter Bashir is just one of the many around the world to be chosen to represent the symbolic milestone.

A BABY born in Bosnia 12 years ago was officially designated the planet's six billionth inhabitant by the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

The 8lb boy, who was later named Adnan Mević, was born in Sarajevo at two minutes past midnight on 12 October 1999 to first-time mother Fatima Nevic, 29.

But the joy at the birth was tempered with the knowledge that the boy had been born a displaced person in the wake of a civil war which killed 200,000 people and left his parents refugees in their own country.

Now in the seventh grade, he still lives in Bosnia in a single-room apartmetn with his parents.

Interviewed by ABC news in October this year, his mother said: “We never heard from the U.N. again. We never received anything from 
them, not even a birthday card,”

Adnan’s father Jasmin is terminally ill with colon cancer and cannot work. His mother lost her job as a textile worker three years ago. Adnan has been diagnosed with a small hole in his heart. They survive on $350 a month and cannot afford the healthcare they need.

In India, the world's second most 
populated country after China, a little girl named Nargis was the 
symbolic seven billionth child to be born.

An official of 
the Plan India Board presented the birth certificate to the mother of 
Nargis at the Community Health Center in Mall, about 28 
miles from Lucknow.

In 
America a baby born to 38-year-old Miran Cin, originally from
 South Korea, could also claim the title.

Little Cin, who is yet to be 
given a first name, was born at Avista Adventist hospital in Louisville, Colorado near Denver at 2:41am local time.

And a baby born in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad was awarded a certificate for being the seven billionth child born.

Little Pyotr's mother Marina Nikolaeva was given the document in a ceremony in hospital.

Several more parents assuming their child was the seven billionth to have been born have been photographed and celebrated in ceremonies all over the world from the USA to Japan, just like little Danica.

The Philippines, ranked 12th as the most populated 
country in the world, joined the rest of the world as it welcomed Danica - its 
symbolic seven billionth baby - in a simple ceremony at the hospital.

Danica was born two minutes before 
midnight and arrived to a celebratory cheer at the packed Government-run
 Jose Fabella Hospital in Manila.

Weighing 5lbs 5oz, 
Danica May Camacho was delivered amid an 
explosion of media flash bulbs in the delivery room at Manila's Jose 
Fabella Memorial Hospital.

Mother Camille Dalura said: 'She looks so lovely. I can't believe she is the world's seventh billion.'

The baby is the second child for Camille and her partner Florante, who quietly stood in a corner 
wearing a white hospital gown as television crews and photographers 
crowded to get a shot of his daughter.

The parents and the baby were met by top United Nations officials in the Philippines, who presented the child with a small cake.

There were also gifts from local benefactors including a scholarship grant for the child's study, and a livelihood package to enable the parents to start a general store.

Also on hand to witness the landmark event was 12-year-old Lorrize Mae Guevarra, who was being declared the world's symbolic six billionth baby in 1999 and is now in the sixth grade - despite the UN officially naming a child born in Bosnia in October of that year as the official six billionth.Guevarra said: 'I am very happy to see this cute baby. I hope like me she will grow up to become healthy and well loved by everyone.'

The child is one of several in countries
 around the world being declared a symbolic seven billionth human.The 
United Nations has declared October 31 as Seven Billion day - the date 
when the  globe's population is estimated to reach seven billion.

It was hoped she would arrive at exactly midnight, but she was delivered two minutes early.

Health Secretary Enrique Ona said the
 arrival of the world's seven billionth baby also presented the 
Philippines with an opportunity to assess population related issues.

According to the UN Population Fund 
(UNFPA) State of the World Population Report, the Philippines is the 
12th most populous country in the world with 94.9 million people.

China continues to have the biggest share of the population at 1.35 billion, followed by India at 1.24 billion.

The report noted that in many parts 
of the developing world, where population growth outpaces economic 
growth, reproductive health care remains a crucial issue.

UNFPA representative Ugochi Daniels 
said that while the Philippine population remains young, with people 
under 25 making up 54 percent of the total, they needed to be taught 
proper 'life skills' and about sexual issues.

She said that while women were having fewer children globally, the overall population continued to go up.

'While our world of seven billion 
represents a complex picture of trends and paradoxes, there are some 
essential global truths we observe,' she said. 'Conversely, there is no one global population outlook.'

The UNFPA said 10 percent of Filipino 
girls aged 15 to 19 have started child bearing, with many of the young 
also increasingly vulnerable to HIV.

There is scepticism over the accuracy
 of the UN's Seven Billion Day estimation, with critics saying there is 
no way of truly telling when the population of the human race hits the 
landmark.

In the past century, the world’s 
population has increased fourfold. And it has only been 12 years since 
the planet marked six billion people.

Many
 independent demographers say the UN has jumped the gun. Early 2013 is 
their best guess, but it could be as late as 2019 that the landmark is reached.
