Crowds of Catholics have flocked to a Malaysian hospital to to hold a prayer vigil in front of what they believe to be a vision of the Virgin Mary which has 'miraculously' appeared on one of the building's windows.

More than 100 worshippers, some from hundreds of miles away, have converged on the Sime Darby Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur after the vision appeared a few days ago.

The group, who are convinced that the mysterious mark on the seventh floor window represents the much revered mother of Jesus Christ, say that they can also see a second image of her son two windows away.

Visitors have been lighting candles praying and singing hymns close to the image which has gone viral on Facebook.

It has been described by some on the scene as a 'miracle'.

Father Lawrence Andrew, editor of Malaysian Catholic newsletter The Herald, said that the church would need to investigate and verify the authenticity of the images and 'the experiences of the witnesses'.

'It could be private revelations. We have to make sure they are not imagined but real apparitions,' he said.

Eunice Fernandez, who lives nearby, said: 'We believe Mary, mother of God, has a message for us, as she is looking down on us and then at a Malaysian flag. We can also see Jesus and he is also moving, they are not static.'

The 54-year-old housewife dismissed claims the image could be a hoax.

The hospital have yet to comment on the vision.
