An Indiana police officer has been suspended without pay but gets to keep his job after video has emerged of the high-ranking cop pushing a paraplegic man out of his wheelchair after blocking him from motoring by him during a 2013 stop.

The news that Lafayette Police Department Lt. Tom Davidson gets to keep his job comes after the chief of the department revealed the the entire command staff had recommended that he be fired.

In the video, you see several police officers, including Davidson, question Nicholas Kincade on a sidewalk in Indianapolis on October 1, 2013.

Uncalled for: Video shows Lt. Tom Davidson push Nicholas Kincade from his wheelchair

No support: The entire command staff at Davidson's department recommended that he be fired for pushing Kincade

As Kincade - who has no use of his legs and is confined to a motorized wheelchair - tries to motor around Davidson, who is standing in the way of his wheelchair, he appears to bump the officer's foot.

At that point, Davidson is clearly seen violently pushing the disabled man out of his wheelchair and onto the street.

'What the f***,' the shaken Kincade yelled after the officer pushes him to the pavement.

Kincade was then arrested for battery on a police officer after he was taken away from the scene on a stretcher. 

The unfortunate incident occurred near the Excel School, where police were called by school staff after Kincade allegedly told them he had a gun in his backpack.

Free to go: Kincade was free to go, but Davidson stood directly in his path as he tried to carry on

Help: Because he can't walk, the officers were forced to help the disabled man up before arresting him

The responding officers, including Davidson, quickly determined that Kincade didn't have a gun.

At the request of the school, the officers issued Kincade a warning to not trespass on school property, and then he should have been free to go.

Davidson - who was standing directly in Kincade's way after he was supposedly free to carry on - had other plans, and toppled Kincade without warning when his wheelchair grazed the officer's foot.

Following the incident, Davidson was put on administrative leave as the department did an internal investigation of the incident, according to TurnTo23.com.

The investigation concluded that Davidson violated the department's rules regarding 'unbecoming conduct' 
and 'response to resistance.'

The officers who conducted the investigation recommended that Davidson be fired.

'It was just inappropriate,' Lafayette Police Chief Patrick  Flannelly, who recommended that Davidson be fired, told the Lafayette Journal and Courier.

Assistance: Kincade needed to be taken off on a stretcher after he was pushed

Disruption: Police were called to this charter school after Kincade told school staff that he had a gun

Making it more disconcerting, he continued, was the fact that Davidson was the highest ranking officer at the scene.

But Flannelly doesn't make hiring and firing decisions about officers in his department. That's a job for the Lafayette Police Civil Service Commission, 'which is made up of five 
Lafayette citizens who vote on decisions about LPD hiring, promotions 
and discipline,' as described by TurnTo23.com.

The Commissioner found that 'Davidson had engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer. They disagreed, 
however, on the second charge brought against him, voting 3-2 that his 
use of force in response to resistance was in line with LPD policies.'

Rather than termination, the Commission opted to strip Davidson of his rank, as well as serve a 30-day unpaid suspension and one year probation.

The prosecutor announced Monday that no charges would be filed against Davidson or Kincade stemming from the incident.
