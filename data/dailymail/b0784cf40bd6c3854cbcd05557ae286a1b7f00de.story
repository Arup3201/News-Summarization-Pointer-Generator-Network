Hillary Clinton was heckled a half-dozen times today during a campaign stop for Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who is seeking the state's top job.

Clinton was just a few minutes into her remarks at the University of Maryland's College Park campus when a group of five protesters holding signs that said 'choose families over politics' began shouting at her about immigration.

'You know immigration's an important issue,' Clinton told them. 

The presumed 2016 presidential candidate tried to talk over the noisy group. But the crowd of several hundred people came to her aid and drowned the protesters out by cheering and chanting, 'HILLARY! HILLARY!'

Anthony Brown, right, Democratic nominee for Maryland governor, and Ken Ulman, left, Democratic candidate for Lt. Gov., at the University of Maryland in College Park today. Clinton was interrupted a half-dozen times by hecklers

Eventually Clinton got her speech back on track and she finished strong, talking about the type of future she wanted her granddaugher Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky to have

When the commotion died down, Clinton told the protesters, 'You know if they had just waited a little while, I was getting to the DREAM Act.'

After the group was escorted out, Clinton said she was 'proud to be in state that has opened the doors of opportunity to students who work and study hard, regardless of their parents' immigration status'.

As a Senator, Hillary said she was proud to sponsor federal DREAM Act legislation, which would have granted legal status to people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

The legislation failed to pass, but President Obama enacted much of its language unilaterally in 2012. 

'I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, and I believe that we have to fix our broken immigration system,' she explained.

'We have to treat everyone with dignity and compassion, uphold the rule of law and respect our heritage as a nation of immigrants, [trying] to build a better life, bringing millions of hard-working people out of the shadows...'

No Clinton got back on track, she was interrupted again. 

'You know when you've been doing this as long as I have or [Maryland Sen. Barbara] Mikulski or [Maryland Sen. Ben] Cardin, it's important to keep moving forward, and yes, of course we want people to be advocates,' she tried to say, but she was cut off a third time.

The former first lady then attempted to shift topics to her support for equal pay for equal work, but the hecklers, spread throughout the gymnasium, wouldn't let her.

Throughout the 20 minute speech, Clinton was heckled six separate times, though it was not immediately clear if all of her critics were immigration reform advocates working together, or if they were supporting different causes.

An organizer for United We Dream told Politico after the event that more than two dozen supporters of the group were sprinkled throughout the crowd, however.

'I think she avoided the question like she has in the other events where we’ve tried to connect with her before,' the organizer, Greisa Martinez, said.

'I know that Hillary Clinton is a very intelligent woman and she knows exactly what we are talking about… it’s not about the DREAM Act and it’s not about immigration reform…it’s about administrative relief, and so to hear her use that as a cop out to” avoid answering was frustrating.'

President Barack Obama was similarly interrupted when he appeared in Maryland on Brown's behalf two weeks ago at an early vote rally.

Before there were jeers for Clinton there were loud cheers as she took the stage.

'Join me in welcoming Charlotte's grandmother, my friend and yours, Hillary Rodham Clinton,' Brown, the state's Democratic nominee for governor, told the crowd as Clinton entered the room to Pharrell Williams' song Happy. 

Clinton acknowledged the title change later in her remarks. 'I felt pretty good about that. I'm not sure I've been introduced before as Charlotte's grandmother.' 

The Clintons' only daughter Chelsea gave birth to her first child, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, in late September. 

'Obviously,' she said, her family has spent a lot of time 'thinking about this little baby's future.' And we are 'going to do everything we can to make sure she has every opportunity, good schools, good health.'

'We'll absolutely be committed to making that happen,' Clinton said. 'But then I think about what will it be like for her in 20, 25 years, when like so many of you, she's going to be starting her adult life,' Clinton told the university students.

'What will our country be like?' she asked. 'Will we will have the commitment to the American Dream that I was raised with? Anthony was raised with? The feeling that yeah, you had to work hard, you had to get an education, you had to do your part, but the opportunities were going to be there. Other people were going to be making those investments to give you the chance to live up to your own God-given potential,' and have a voice, she said.

'So of course I want for my granddaughter that type of future,' she noted, but Clinton said she also wants other peoples' children to have those opportunities. 

Repeating a now-familiar line in her stump speech, Clinton said that Americans should not have to be the relative of a president or secretary of state to be ensured a fair shake in life.

That's why it's so important that Democrats in the audience do everything they can to convince people who are 'tuned out to turn out' in next Tuesday's election she said.

As Clinton was closing her remarks one more person appeared to angrily shout at her, however it was not immediately clear what the person was saying.
