After a tough week off the field, the NFL got back to playing — and the focus turned to big-name players who were injured all over the league.

Robert Griffin III, Jamaal Charles, DeSean Jackson, A.J. Green and Knowshon Moreno all left their games on a busy Sunday for team trainers and medical staffs.

Griffin dislocated his left ankle in the first quarter of Washington's 41-10 victory over Jacksonville, putting his season in jeopardy. The Redskins quarterback was scheduled for X-rays and an MRI to determine more about the injury. He and coach Jay Gruden did not offer a timetable for a return, but the injury typically sidelines NFL players for at least two months.

'Moments like this,' Griffin said, 'you just have to keep the faith.'

If there is also a fracture, Griffin will need surgery and will almost certainly be done for the year. He was hurt when he landed awkwardly on his ankle as he finished the throw and then tumbled out of bounds. The pass was caught by Jackson for an 11-yard gain.

'It's an excruciating pain,' Griffin said. 'Anytime you look at your ankle and it's going in a strange direction, you don't want to get up.'

Jackson also left the game shortly after he sprained the AC joint in his left shoulder in the first quarter. He hoped to be able to play next week against Philadelphia, his former club.

Other Redskins players injured included running back Roy Helu (strained quadriceps), guard Shawn Lauvao (sprained right knee) and fullback Darrel Young (sprained back).

Jaguars tight end Marcedes Lewis was carted off after leaving with a high left ankle sprain. Rookie receiver Allen Hurns injured his left ankle and was scheduled for X-rays.

In Denver, Charles left with a left ankle injury after being brought down in the first quarter against the Broncos, and would not return. Charles was stopped on a run up the middle by Broncos safety T.J. Ward and then hobbled to the bench.

Green aggravated an injured toe during the Cincinnati Bengals' opening series and sat out the rest of the game, a 24-10 win over Atlanta.

Green missed practice time during the week with an injured toe on his right foot. He started against the Falcons, but came to the sideline after a few plays to have the foot examined. He walked off without assistance, limping slightly.

The Bengals lost four more players: Pro Bowl linebacker Vontaze Burfict (pinched nerve in his neck), defensive tackle Brandon Thompson (left knee), tight end Alex Smith (left biceps) and right guard Kevin Zeitler (right calf).

At Orchard Park, New York, Moreno didn't return after injuring his left elbow 11 minutes into Miami's 29-10 loss to the Bills. He was hurt on his first carry, a 4-yard gain, when he was initially hit on the right side by Nickell Robey, and Nigel Bradham then struck him from the left, hitting him directly in the arm.

Tennessee cornerback Jason McCourty injured a groin muscle and missed the second half of the Titans' 26-10 loss at home to Dallas.

Arizona quarterback Carson Palmer was ruled out against the New York Giants on Sunday because of a shoulder injury. After he was limited at practice all week, he was replaced by Drew Stanton, an eight-year veteran who had four previous career starts. Stanton went 14 of 19 for 167 yards and led the Cardinals on three long scoring drives in a 25-14 victory.

Giants cornerback Walter Thurmond left in the second half of the loss with a pectoral injury, and middle linebacker Jon Beason went out with a toe injury.

Tampa Bay running back Doug Martin sat out the Buccaneers' game against St. Louis because of a knee injury. Meanwhile, Rams quarterback Shaun Hill was active after being limited in practice with a thigh injury, but third-stringer Austin Davis got the start.
