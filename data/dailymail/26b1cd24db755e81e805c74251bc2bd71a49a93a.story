Most children learn how to swear before they even know the alphabet, according to a new book that examines bad language and its origins.

English speakers also use a curse word on average once in every 140 words, roughly the same proportion as the first person plural pronouns such as ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our.’

The surprising preponderance of swearing in everyday language probably explains why the majority of children know at least one obscene word by the age of two, says language expert Dr. Mellissa Mohr, from Stanford University in California.

It really ‘kicks off’, she adds, around the ages of three and four.

She claims that over an average day around 0.7 per cent of English language consists of swear words.

In her new book, ‘Holy Sh*t: A Brief 
History of Swearing,’ Dr. Mohr claims the upper classes are just as 
likely to turn the air blue as less educated working class people. 

The group least likely to use swear words, says the researcher, is the middle class.

‘This goes back to the Victorian era 
idea that you get control over your language and your deportment, which 
indicates that you are a proper, good person and this is a sign of your 
morality and awareness of social rules,' she said.

‘Aristocrats have a secure position 
in society, so they can say whatever they want — and may even make a 
show of doing so,’ she adds.

Dr. Mohr said her book sets out to correct some misconceptions people have about swearing.

Rather than lazy language, 
obscenities can have practical uses, such as providing relief from pain 
if a person gets hurt, for instance when you hit your hand with a 
hammer.

Studies have shown that swearing sometimes has a genuine physiological effect on the body.

Swearing also helps to form social 
solidarity - for example, when workers use swear words while talking 
about their managers, it builds an 'in-group' which aids social and 
professional interaction.

Dr. Mohr, who holds a PhD in Renaissance literature from Stanford, also told Time magazine that swearing is nothing new.

The Romans, like us, used taboo words
 relating to sexuality as insults, while the word 's***' originated in 
the Old English language of the Anglo-Saxons.
