Sarah Collins Rudolph, who was the lone survivor of a 1963 Alabama church bombing that killed four black girls, is seeking millions in compensation and says she won't accept a top congressional award to honor the victims.

Mrs Rudolph said that she feels forgotten more than 50 years after the bombing at Birmingham’s Sixteenth Street Baptist Church on September 16, 1963.

Her sister, Addie Mae Collins, 14, as well as 14-year-olds Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair were killed in the blast in the ladies’ room in the church basement. They were later eulogized by Dr Martin Luther King Jr.

Speaking with the Associated Press today, Mrs Rudolph said that no one seems to remember the Alabama blast that took the lives of the four girls, as well as her own eye – and is seeking untold millions in restitution.

The bomb was planted by white supremacist Robert Chambliss, Tomas Blanton Jr. and later Bobby Frank Cherry. A fourth conspirator, Herman Frank Cash, died in 1994. But, as the New York Times noted in a 2002 article, justice has been even slower than Mrs Rudoph’s recovery.

Cherry was 71 when he was finally convicted in 2002; Chamblis was charged in 1977, and Blanton in 2001. Each were in the Ku Klux Klan.

In an interview with NPR earlier this year, Mrs Collins spoke of the horror of that September day and the terror she experienced. ‘I was standing there, just bleeding,’ she told the station.

‘Somebody came and they just picked me up and took me out through the hole and put me in (an) ambulance.’

She was only 12 when she lost both her sister and her eye, and spent the following months recovering in a hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries to restore vision in her left eye.

Some glass still remains embedded in the eye, as with her chest and abdomen, as doctors thought it too risky to remove.

Mrs Rudolph, who lives in a ranch-style house just outside of Birmingham with her husband George, said that she has worked various blue-collar jobs throughout the years at steel mills, but that medical bills have slowly mounted.

The survivor said that in 1963, counseling was not available to children in stressful events, and so she’s spent the past five decades dealing with severe post-traumatic stress.

For decades, Mrs Rudolph refused to speak of the horrific event, but first opened up in 2002 after the last conspirator had been convicted.

‘The bomb blew a big crater through the building, and I was standing right there in front of it,’ she told Baylor magazine at the time. ‘I didn’t know which way to go.’

Mrs Rudolph eventually returned to school, but was mocked because of her ill-fitting prosthetic eye, which would fall out upon the slightest false move. According to the magazine, she endured years of taunting and ridicule, and vowed not to go to college as a way to put an end to her torment.

But she still suffers.

‘I still shake. I still jump when I hear loud sounds,’ she told NPR. ‘Every day I think about it, just looking in the mirror and seeing the scars of my face,’ she said, adding that looking at her scars proves a constant reminder of the bombing.

She and her husband George went last October to the Birmingham City Council for help. But Mr Rudolph said that her attempts fell on deaf ears.

Sole survivor: Ms Collins, 12, was temporarily blinded by glass and lost her right eye to it; she spent several months in the hospital

Mr Rudolph told NPR: ‘If you look back at the people in the (World Trade Center), each one of those victims got paid,’ he said.

The mayor of Birmingham, William Bell, said at the time that while he appreciates the depth of Mrs Rudolph’s suffering, the city is simply not able to cut her a check for her pain.

Though Congress is mulling over whether to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the four girls who were killed,

The brother of Cynthia Wesley, Fate Morris, told the AP that he too is not interested in the medal, Congress' highest honor.
