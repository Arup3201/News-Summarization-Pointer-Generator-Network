Damning: A report will claim more than 50 victims, one as young as eight, were abused by Jimmy Savile (pictured) at Stoke Mandeville alone

Jimmy Savile abused an eight-year-old girl when she had 144 stitches across the lower part of her body as a result of surgery for cancer, it was revealed last night.

The victim, now in her 40s, said that when she raised her complaint with a ward sister at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, she was met with the response: ‘Be quiet, you silly girl. Do you realise how much he has done for the hospital?’

Horrific details of her case emerged ahead of damning report out today that will reveal the hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, received ten complaints about Savile, but victims’ statements were ignored.

The woman said the abuse had ‘shaped’ her life. She added: ‘I went into hospital an innocent young girl and I left damaged.

‘I wish that I had possessed the strength back then to pursue him properly. I want to see some accountability from the report into Stoke Mandeville. No one has properly said sorry. 

'We must make sure this can never, ever happen again to anyone else in an institution. No more lives must be ruined.’

Today, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will apologise to dozens of hospital patients amid new revelations about the extent of abuse, described as ‘horrific’. 

An official report will publish allegations that Savile assaulted and raped at least 44 victims at Stoke Mandeville.

One of the abuse complaints reached a hospital manager, after the victim had already told a nurse and a ward manager. Nine reports were made to nurses alone, the report is believed to say.

More than 50 victims were abused by Savile at Stoke Mandeville alone. Those affected included patients, staff and visitors.

The Stoke Mandeville inquiry was led by independent investigator Dr Androulla Johnstone and overseen by a local oversight panel led by the hospital trust’s non-executive director, Keith Gilchrist.

Figures showing David Cameron has spectacularly failed to meet his promise to cut immigration will today be ‘buried’ under a slew of reports about the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Ministers were last night accused of ‘cynically’ timing the release of the Savile investigations by two Government departments to coincide with the migration statistics.

Both will be released at 9.30am – with reports into Savile’s paedophile abuse in at least 12 NHS hospitals and 21 children’s homes and schools certain to get blanket coverage.

The migration statistics will be released without fanfare by the independent Office for National Statistics. They are expected to show net migration has risen again, to more than 260,000. Whitehall officials and MPs are convinced the date has been chosen deliberately.

Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: ‘Thursday, it is clear, is, for this Government, a good day to bury bad news.’

Savile, the former Radio 1 DJ and television personality, began volunteering as a porter at Stoke Mandeville in the 1970s and helped to raise £40million for its spinal injuries centre. 

He had free use of a flat and office on the hospital site.

The report will also say Savile’s reputation as a ‘sex pest’ was an open secret. Staff described him as ‘creepy’ and ‘a lecher’ who had access to the mortuary alone, out of hours.

Stoke Mandeville’s former director of nursing, Chris McFarlane, said reports of abuse by Savile ‘never reached senior management ears’. She added: ‘Jimmy had 100 per cent access to the hospital, to all parts.’

Liz Dux, a solicitor representing the victims, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We expect the report to once again outline horrendous levels of abuse.

‘And we believe it will also have uncovered many missed opportunities to stop the abuse and even bring Savile to justice.

‘The victims are hopeful the review will establish a much greater level of accountability than the previous one did. Anything less will rightly be seen as a whitewash by those people still suffering from the awful crimes Savile committed all those years ago.’

Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said it would not comment ahead of the report’s publication today.
