A little girl who was so tiny that she could only fit into dolls' clothes when she was born prematurely is now preparing to start primary school.

Kim Blake, 36, was warned that her daughter Janey, now three, had less than a one per cent chance of survival when she was born nearly three months premature.

For reasons still unknown, the placenta feeding Janey in the womb had failed to form properly, blocking vital nutrients and oxygen. She was born weighing just 1lb 7oz.

'Our daughter Jodie had the idea of dressing her in a pair of pink leggings she had taken from one of her dolls. They were a perfect fit,' said her mother Kim Blake

Mrs Blake, who volunteers as a Cub Scout leader, said: 'We brought her home in time for her brother Jason’s birthday. I’d ordered clothes for Janey from the internet, but when they arrived they were obviously far too large to fit her.

'Janey actually had ‘Baby Born’ written on her bum for a little while.'

Mrs Blake, of Watford, was shocked when she was told by doctors at a 28 week scan that they wanted to deliver Janey immediately by emergency Cesarean section.

She said: 'They said there was a problem with the blood supply through the umbilical chord and they wanted to deliver her straight away.

'They informed me that the delivery unit was ready to receive me. I panicked - I didn’t think she had the slightest chance of surviving. At the time she weighed just 450 grams.'

Mrs Blake and her husband Steve, 37, a Royal Mail worker, were taken to the special care baby unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.

The delivery was postponed at the last minute by a senior consultant who wanted to carry out tests to see whether Janey would survive outside the womb.

Mrs Blake would stay on the ward for another 10 days, during which time she was encouraged to prepare for the reality of caring for a premature baby.

She said: 'The midwives suggested we visited the neonatal area, where we were lucky to meet a new mum and the premature baby she was caring for. It was a very useful experience to see what a premature baby looks like in real life.

'It reduced the shock and the fear of the unknown.

'Still, it was a very nervous wait. A consultant told us he expected Janey to have less than one per cent chance of survival and we were warned that if she wasn’t breathing when she arrived, they wouldn’t attempt to resuscitate her.

'I asked them to give her one go - in case she just needed a kickstart to get going.'

To Mr and Mrs Blake’s relief, Janey cried at the delivery before she was immediately taken to an incubator.

The midwives informed them the placenta had been rock-hard and so small it could have fitted into half a disposable cup.

Mrs Blake advised other parents caring for premature babies to treat their children as individual cases and avoid the temptation to compare the progress of their children with others

'We were told Janey might miss some developmental milestones, but she's rushed ahead. She started walking at a young age than her younger sister,' said her mother

The cause of the placenta malformation remains a mystery.

Janey had her first meal - one drop of milk - at five days old.

She fought off a serious infection seven days after her birthday and required four blood transfusions before she was strong enough to return home to her brother Jason, now 11, and sister Jodie, 10.

Mrs Blake said: 'The children had seen a photograph of Janey shortly after she was born and Jason’s reaction was to ask if she was alive.

'He came to visit Janey while she was still in hospital and the nurse asked what he wanted for his upcoming birthday. He said he wanted his sister to come home. She arrived home just in time for the party.

'We were struggling to find something for Jodie to wear because her legs were still so small. That’s when Jodie walked in holding her doll’s leggings and said, ‘what about these?’.

'We were told Janey might miss some developmental milestones, but she’s rushed ahead. She started walking at a young age than her younger sister.'

Janey started nursery school last year and in September this year she will enter primary school reception class.

Mrs Blake said: 'At first we had problems finding her a uniform for nursery - we were still buying trousers from Mothercare and she wore a vest meant for nine to 12 month old children.

'But since Christmas she’s really hit a growth spurt. She’s not too far away from her classmates in height - she’s not the shortest any more - but she’s still very skinny, so we carefully monitor her diet and general health.

'She’s a very caring girl who loves animals. She’s very cheeky and bossy - she’s definitely in charge of the older two and comes across as being older than she is.'

Mrs Blake advised other parents caring for premature babies to treat their children as individual cases and avoid the temptation to compare the progress of their children with others.

She said: We are in touch with parents whose children were in a similar situation to Janey’s. Janey spent longer in the incubator than many of them, but is doing better than them in many ways now.

'Remember that every child is individual.'
