TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was surprised to find psychedelic mushrooms which cause vivid hallucinations growing in the garden at Buckingham Palace.

The presenter found the red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria while filming an ITV gardening show called The Queen's Garden and said: 'I won't be eating any of that.'

He was touring the private 40-acre site with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley and asked him whether the fungus is edible.

Professor Crawley replied saying: 'That depends what you mean. It's eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

'The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.'

Titchmarsh jokingly replied: 'I think I'll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.' 

The fungus, also known as fly agaric, contains the psychoactive chemicals ibotenic acid and muscimol and they can be found throughout the UK.

Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungus is not served to Royals.

He said: 'There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms.

'As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients.'

He told the Sun: 'For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.' 

This type of fungus can often be found growing under birch or pine trees, especially Monterey and Bishop pine which are common in the garden at Buckingham Palace.

With permission from Her Majesty The Queen, Alan Titchmarsh spent a whole year exploring the Buckingham Palace Garden, which has a five-century history.

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He said: 'Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.' 

During her reign, Her Majesty has made the garden a place where nature thrives. It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies.

It's been the garden of Queen Elizabeth II for longer than any other monarch. A rare film from 1937 shows the Queen as an 11-year-old princess with her younger sister princess Margaret, having just moved into the palace. 

Mr Titchmarsh heard tales about the Queen's childhood from royal historian Dr Lucy Worsley, who explains that the young princesses held a wistful fascination with what was beyond the garden walls.

Amanita muscaria, also known as fly agaric, can cause vivid hallucinations 

Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered mushrooms in popular culture.

The white-spotted, usually red mushroom is viewed as the quintessential toadstool and can be found throughout Europe and America, often growing under birch and pine trees.

The fungus is well-known for its hallucinogenic properties because it has a high level of a psycoactive agent called muscimol.

Historically the mushrooms were used by medicine men or ‘shamans’ of north east Asia.

There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in Siberia, the Middle East, India, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.

Fly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects as they can change dramatically depending on the habitat and the amount ingested per body weight.

Effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions and mood swings.

It can cause  vivid hallucinations, often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects. Some users report having spiritual experiences.

The fungi are often considered poisonous and a fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps.

The sale of fresh and prepared magic mushrooms containing psilocin or psilocybin has been illegal in Ireland since January 2006.
