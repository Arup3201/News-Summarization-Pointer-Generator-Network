Last week he was the face of Comic Relief, fronting the annual fundraising telethon watched by millions that raised £1billion for good causes.

But now the leftwing firebrand Russell Brand has launched an astonishing attack on the very same charity,  claiming he felt 'compromised' by accepting the gig.

During his show at London's Proud Archivist on Sunday, Brand, 39, asked: 'Is it right to do Comic Relief? Plus is any f***er watching it?' he said.

Brand, 39, even claimed he felt 'compromised by accepting the job hosting last week's Red Nose Day fundraising telethon which was watched by 8.1 million people and helped Comic Relief breaking the £1 billion barrier

'Those were the questions I was asking myself as I walked out confidently onto the Palladium stage. And the answer is, 'No, not really'.' 

He then appeared to launch a scathing attack on British charities, claiming they were 'part of the problem'.

The comedian had enraged some viewers on Red Nose day when he joked about sharing syringes.

During the charity telethon, Brand said: 'I'm in the unfortunate position of having to ask you to donate money to buy syringes, literally the exact opposite of how I spend most of my time, and the previous two decades of my life,' he said.

'Fighting every instinct of my being. 'Don't make 'em not work again, that's terrible. I'll share. Sharing is caring. Although do watch out for infectious blood diseases.'

Met with nervous laughs from the audience he went onto compare the distasteful joke to the controversy involving Jeremy Clarkson;s alleged use of the 'n-word'.

The comedian and self-styled revolutionary said: 'Ultimately taking responsibility away from the centralised powers of created government, corporations and alleviating that stress and tensions by placing the burden once more on ordinary people. 

'Is charity part of the problem?'

Despite his bizarre rant, Brand admitted those behind 'Comic Relief had 'good intentions'. 

His comments are made even stranger by the fact that vegetarian Brand has been an open supporter of several charities including Amnesty International, David Lynch Foundation, Hillsborough Family Support Group and PETA.

He is also the ambassador for The Recovery Group UK, a supportive body for addiction, and has joined protests against austerity cuts.

Dr Karl Wilding, director of public policy at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said there had never been a clear answer to where the responsibility lay between state and charities.

Just two days after the Comic Relief gig, and asked an audience at his show at London's Proud Archivist (pictured) if charity was 'part of the problem?'

'It's not clear what Mr Brand's proposed solution is. Mr Brand has, in his own particular way, highlighted an age-old philosophical debate about where the boundaries of the state's responsibility should lie, which has never had a clear answer

'Charities run high-quality, innovative services that are responsive to the needs in different areas. They also create a way for people to help support causes they care about, either through donating or volunteering.' 

A spokesman for Comic Relief said: 'Russell Brand has been involved in Comic Relief in many brilliant ways over the years and we're enormously grateful. He was a fantastic addition to the night of telly last week, and we're thrilled that he was able to give his time.'

Last December, Russell Brand was accused of hypocrisy after he ranted about rising rents in London even though he lives in a £2million bachelor pad owned by a firm based in a tax haven.

The millionaire comedian and self-styled revolutionary flew into a rage when it was suggested he was part of the housing problem in trendy Hoxton, east London, where he rents a £5,000-a-month loft.

Brand had joined hundreds of residents and supporters of the New Era estate in Hoxton, east London- built as affordable housing for local workers- in a protest over fears that New York-based Westbrook Partners want to hike rents to market levels.

The star, believed to be worth £9million, was helping deliver a petition on affordable housing to 10 Downing Street to champion the cause.

But Brand lost his temper when TV reporter Paraic O'Brien asked him whether the super-rich buying up property in London was driving up prices for everyone else.

The incensed star said he is 'part of the solution' and called the reporter a 'snide' for asking how much he pays in rent.

Asked about the value of his home, the 39-year-old angrily replied: 'I'm not interested in talking to you about my rent, mate. I'm here to support a very important campaign.'

Simon Cowell labelled Brand a 'hypocrite' last year

Accused of being 'part of the problem' of rocketing housing prices, Brand, 39, said: 'I am part of the solution.'

He suggested his fame meant he was able to 'amplify the voices of ordinary people'.

Asked again about his house, Brand pointed his finger in O'Brien's face and said: 'It's rented. We don't know the value, you would have to talk to my landlord. Blessedly, I can afford my rent and I'm prepared to stand up for people that can't.'

Refusing to answer further questions about his own housing costs, Brand terminated the two-minute interview and accused the reporter of trying to wreck his campaign, saying: 'Snides like you, mate, undermine it. You're a snide.' 

An estate agent who asked not to be named said of Brand's property: 'We had it on at £1,150 per week two or three years ago.'

The warehouse conversion last changed hands in March 2007 when it was bought by a property firm in the British Virgin Islands for £1.25million, having sold three years earlier at £730,000.

Prices have shot even higher across the capital since.

Brand is understood to have sold a previous home, a five-storey house in Hampstead, North West London, for £2.3million in 2010. 

Westbrook Partners have since sold the development to Dolphin Square Charitable Foundation, an affordable housing group which says it is committed to delivering low cost rents to Londoners on low to middle incomes. 

Simon Cowell also labelled Brand a 'hypocrite' last year after he accused the comedian of accepting large Hollywood film salaries whilst campaigning against the UK political system.

The music mogul told Russell to give up his multi-million pound salary if he was planning to continue his campaigning streak. 

Russell Brand took part in the protest outside Parliament which was orchestrated by activists who said they intended to cause chaos throughout London

The X Factor boss told Shortlist magazine: 'A revolution? He's getting $10 million a movie.

'I mean come on! Well give your money back then, Russell. I always say that about people. Start off as you mean to go on.

'Donate all the money back to the revolution and then I'll believe it. I'm living in a $10 million mansion and I want a revolution? Give me a break.'

The self-styled anti-establishment figure also faced fierce online backlash with social media users labelling him as the 'epitome of a champagne socialist' when it emerged that he left a Bonfire Night protest to take his place alongside a host of celebrities invited to a West End press night 

Brand had joined the crowd as thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators descended on Westminster for a protest which saw scuffles with police.

But he was later spotted joining celebrities including fellow comedians Jimmy Carr and David Walliams in the West End for the press night of Made In Dagenham at the Adelphi Theatre. 

One outraged Twitter user wrote: 'Russell Brand loves a revolution but then leaves demonstration early to go to a celeb freebie party'. A number of others pointed out that so-called anti-capitalist Brand had amassed a personal fortune worth millions.'
