A teenager was found dead in wetlands after leaving her home barefoot in December following a row with her family, an inquest heard.

Nida Naseer vanished from her parents' house in Newport, South Wales, last December after an argument over 'cultural differences'.

The 18-year-old student's  body was found in marshland three months later. An inquest at Newport Civic Centre heard that she might have fallen from a bridge into the River Usk.

Nida Naseer's disappearance sparked a nationwide search with her sister Shamyla Naseer (left) and mother Najma Tahir (right) issuing an appeal for information

However, with no confirmed sightings after she disappeared and a post-mortem examination revealing no sign of injuries, and the circumstances surrounding her death remain a mystery.

The coroner heard how Pakistan-born Miss Naseer had been a 'straight grade A student' who wanted to go to university.

But because her family's asylum claim had been turned down - and they would not be able to afford her tuition fees - her degree dreams lay in tatters.

Father Naseer Tahir was in the front room with his grandson on December 28 last year when his daughter suddenly got up and walked out at around 7.10pm.

In a statement read aloud at the hearing, he said: 'There was a disagreement over cultural matters that evening.

'Nida was sat downstairs with me and her nephew when suddenly without warning she got up and left the room.

'As she was not wearing winter clothes or any footwear I thought she must have gone to put something in the bin outside.

'But when she did not return I became anxious.' 

Mortorised wheelchair user Mr Tahir, who sat through the inquest with his young grandson on his lap, then called up to Miss Naseer's sister and brother to go and look for their sibling.

After his family had searched nearby streets for an hour, he went to Newport Central police station as well as the Royal Gwent Hospital in the hope of tracing her - but to no avail.

'I have had no contact with my daughter since she left the house on December 28,' he said.

'I cannot explain why she left the house. The family disagreement would not have been the reason.

'Earlier in the year she had been upset over her inability to pursue her chosen education at university.

'Her disappearance is a complete mystery.'

But despite several emotional public appeals for Miss Naseer to return home, nothing was seen of her until March 27 - when a group of litter-pickers discovered a badly decomposed body on marshland four miles away from Linton Street.

It was later identified by dental records as being Miss Naseer.

Detective Constable Stephen Francis said that, despite numerous appeals for information, no credible sightings of the teenager were ever made.

He added that her disappearance had also been 'totally out of character'. 

Following the discovery of Miss Naseer's body, rivers and tidal expert Dr Robert Francis Allen helped police with their investigation.

The inquest heard that, on the night of Ms Naseer's disappearance, the River Usk had been placed on flood alert - and the nearest access point from Linton Street was Southern Distributor Bridge.

He said: 'It is not possible to determine when, where or how Miss Naseer's body ended up in the water.

'It is possible however to conclude that entry occurred into the River Usk from the vicinity of the Southern Distributor Bridge.

'The natural forces of wind, wave and tides all would have been sufficient to transport the body from start to finish.'

Miss Naseer's claim for asylum was turned down, the inquest heard, meaning they would not be able to afford her tuition fees leaving her degree dreams in tatters

Pathologist Dr Richard Jones said his post-mortem examination into Miss Naseer's death had been 'hampered by decomposition'.

However, he found no evidence of any injuries to her body nor anything which suggested she had been tied up or suffered a fall from a height.

He said: 'It is not possible from the pathology to say how Miss Naseer died, but I have found no evidence to suggest she had been assaulted prior to her death.

'But I am not able to ascertain the medical cause of of Nida's death.'

Recording an open verdict, coroner David Bowen said: 'Police investigations failed to find any evidence as to when, how or in what manner Miss Naseer’s body entered the river. 

'How this happened is pure speculation. And this inquest is not concerned with speculation, it is concerned with the facts.

'Miss Naseer’s father described his daughter’s disappearance as a mystery. From the evidence that I have heard I am satisfied never has such a description been more appropriate.'
