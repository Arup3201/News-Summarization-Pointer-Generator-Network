Warnings that the 'Umbrella Movement' pro-democracy protests could devastate tourism in Hong Kong appear to be unfounded as the country saw a substantial rise in  visitors in October.

The uprising against the Beijing government's stalling of open elections for Hong Kong has led thousands of residents holding protests in the region - which have led to violent clashes with police.

However, despite the ongoing tensions, the Hong Kong Tourism board has reported a 12.6 per cent rise in tourist numbers for October 2014 compared to the same month last year.

And, according to statistics, the greatest increase in numbers concerns visitors from mainland China - with an 18.3 per cent increase.

Beijing banned tour group visas for Chinese visitors to Hong Kong for a week due to protests and coverage of the instability has been censored, however figures for Chinese visitorshave still increased.

Chinese tourists have also been keen to view the pro-democracy art and take selfies in the area.

The huge increase of Chinese visitors has offset a slight decrease in the numbers travelling over to Hong Kong from the Americas, Australia and Europe.

Added to this, there was also a 7.1 per cent increase in South Korean and Japanese visitors.

More tourists means an economy boost, and sales of iPhone 6s, clothing and jewellery are all said to have increased. 

The UK government has updated its travel advice for tourists who are thinking of heading to Hong Kong. It warns holidaymakers to avoid all demonstrations and to keep a keen eye on the media.
