Barack Obama yesterday outlined plans to close a loophole that lets companies such as Apple and Microsoft avoid paying taxes on overseas profits.

The US President used the Budget for 2016 to impose a one-off 14 per cent tax on profits stashed abroad by American corporate giants,

The huge sums expected to be raised - nearly £160 billion - will pay for improvements to roads and bridges in the US, before the rate is increased to 19 per cent in future.

U.S. president Barack Obama speaks at the Department of Homeland Security earlier today to deliver the administration's fiscal year budget for 2016 

The move comes amid an international backlash against firms such as Google and Starbucks that have been accused of avoiding tax on the profits earned in countries around the world, including the UK.

But the tax raid proposed by the Democrat president needs to be approved by Republican-controlled Congress – setting the scene for months of wrangling.

Prominent Republicans have already the criticised the ‘tax and spend’ budget although it has been previously thought that American companies have around £1.4trillion of profits stashed overseas.

Firms do not currently have to pay US tax on foreign profits unless the money is brought back into America.

Critics claim that the huge piles of cash stored overseas is down to aggressive tax planning policies by US companies, but businesses argue that the country’s tax rates are uncompetitive.

The top rate of corporation tax in the US is 35 per cent compared with 21 per cent in Britain.

George Osborne has said UK corporation tax will fall to 20 per cent in April – but Labour has pledged to reverse this tax cut if it wins power in the general election in May.

In the last Autumn Statement Mr Osborne also unveiled the so-called ‘Google tax’, which aims to target the profits earned by multinationals in the UK but diverted elsewhere.

President Obama plans to go much further, however, raising far higher sums of money by targeting the profits both diverted and earned overseas.

He wants to levy a 14 per cent one-off ‘transition’ tax on US profits held overseas as well as a 19 per cent levy on future profits as they are earned.

The White House expects the one-off levy to raise £158 billion which will be used to fund infrastructure projects in the US including new roads and bridges.

The proposals effectively amount to a huge tax raid on technology and drug companies that stash profits overseas in low tax countries such as Ireland and Bermuda.

‘This transition tax would mean that companies have to pay US tax right now rather than being able to delay paying any US tax indefinitely,’ a White House official said.

A report by research firm Audit Analytics last year showed that General Electric had the most profits stored overseas at £73billion.

Tech giants Microsoft and Apple and drugs companies Pfizer and Merck made up the rest of the top five.

The proposals were part of a Budget that was aimed at boosting America’s Middle Class through higher taxes on corporations and the rich.

Mr Obama said: ‘This country’s better off than it was four years ago, but what we also know is that wages and incomes for middle class families are just now ticking up. They haven’t been keeping pace over the last 30 years compared to corporate profits and what’s happening to folks in the very top.’

The Budget, for the fiscal year starting on October 1, forecast the deficit falling from 3.2 per cent of national income this year to 2.5 per cent or £315billion next year.

The deficit would stabilise at that rate over the next 10 years, not rising above 2.6 per cent of national income under the plans.

The Treasury estimates that George Osborne’s Google tax will raise just £25 million in the next financial year, rising to £270 million the following year.

This figure will rise to £355 million by 2019/20 - still a drop in the ocean next to Obama’s tax.
