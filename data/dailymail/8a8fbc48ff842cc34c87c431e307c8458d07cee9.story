They are already one of the music industry's oddest couples.

And now singers Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett have paired up to star in a coveted fashion campaign.

Pop star Gaga, 28, and 88-year-old crooner Tony have been revealed as the faces of H&M's Christmas TV and print campaign.

As well as starring on billboard advertisements and in-store imagery the pair, who have a sixty year age gap, will feature in the brand's TV ads performing a track from their album Cheek To Cheek, which is released on 23rd September.

High street chain H&M are yet to release any of the main images but are giving fans a sneak peek of the studio shoot with this behind-the-scenes image.

The picture shows Gaga chanelling a young Cher in a huge black, curly wig and oversized jumper from the H&M winter collection. Her look is finished with a pair of black fishnets and Seventies style make-up.

Tony, meanwhile, a 17-time Grammy winner, is dressed to impress in a smart black tuxedo suit from the brand, featuring a bright red pocket square.

In November 2013, Lady Gaga officially opened H&M’s Times Square flagship store in New York, with fans queuing for the chance to meet and shop with their idol.

Pop star Gaga, 28, and 88-year-old crooner Tony share a love of jazz

The New Yorker, famous for her eccentric dress sense, is currently on her artRAVE: ARTPOP Ball Tour and has spent two years recording a jazz album with the legendary singer. 

The album's first single, a cover of Cole Porter's Anything Goes, is the first song to be released and other classic ditties on the album include It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Sophisticated Lady, Lush Life and title track, Cheek To Cheek.

Lady Gaga is an award-winning pop star, but the singer says recording jazz music was easier than pop.

'You know, it's funny, but jazz comes a little more comfortable for me than pop music, than R&B music,' Gaga said in an interviewrecently.

'I've sung jazz since I was 13 years old, which is kind of like my little secret that Tony found out. So this is almost easier for me than anything else.'

Bennett said fans will be impressed with Gaga's vocal performance on the upcoming album, adding: 'They're going to say we had no idea she sings that well.'

'And they're gonna say they had no idea that Tony dressed so crazy,' Gaga added, as Bennett smiled. 'When you come out in your meat dress Tony, nobody is going to know what's going on.'

Gaga claims that she is 'actually happier than I've ever been.'

'There's 60 years between us, and when we sing, there's no distance,' she added about working with Bennett.

Is Gaga's 2014 H&M Xmas style inspired by Cher's Moonstruck hair in 1987?
