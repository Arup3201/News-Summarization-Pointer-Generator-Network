These dramatic photographs show how a huge wildfire is raging out of control on Majorca.

Around 700 residents were evacuated early yesterday from the village of Estallencs on the popular holiday island as fires fanned by winds spread eastward along wooded hills, local officials said.

The fire started on Friday east of the leisure port of Andratx and moved along the island's northern forested parkland. Some 360 firefighters and 26 water-carrying aircraft were tackling the flames.

The hills to the north of Mallorca, known as the Sierra de Tramontana, are of great natural beauty and many wealthy people, such as actor Michael Douglas, are known to have villas on its coastline.

Evacuees were treated and accommodated at the Esporlas sports centre due to the fires, which are said to have already burned almost eight square miles of land.

An eyewitness report by an unnamed journalist for the Majorca Daily Bulletin said: ‘The speed of the fire was astonishing you could see its progress almost metre by metre, tree by tree.

‘Soon I could hear the wailing sounds of fire fighting vehicles striving to get to the seat of the fire - the clattering blades of helicopters gave a surreal effect, as though I was watching a re-run of (1979 film) Apocalypse Now.

‘Slowly but surely the firefighters on 
the ground and the helicopters in the sky were seemingly getting to 
grips with the blaze which must have been by now 2 to 3km in length.

‘They were bombarding the fire from different angles with heavily laden water buckets and using red coloured fire-retardant to put out the flames that would suddenly explode back into life as the fickle wind decided to freshen and change direction.’

Majorca was not the only part of the world being affected by wildfires today. Residents of 75 houses in Oregon in the U.S. were advised to leave after a crop of fires were touched off by lightning.

Fire spokesman Cheyne Rossbach said flames from the Douglas Complex fires in the south-west of the state were within a mile of some houses. More than 40 homes were on evacuation alert.
