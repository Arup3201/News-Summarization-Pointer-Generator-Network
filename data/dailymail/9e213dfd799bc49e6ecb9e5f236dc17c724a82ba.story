They are not known as one of the world's prettiest creatures - but this snail is clearly more image-conscious, posing atop a leaf under a makeshift umbrella.

The beautiful images capture the creature below a dew-covered flower, suggesting that it is not as fond of the rain as most snails, who normally flourish in damp conditions.

Amateur photographer Vyacheslav Mischenko, 48, said that the images' colours and setting reminded him of Monet's Woman With a Parasol.

He captured the creature in a forest near his home city of Berdychiv, Ukraine.

Mr Mischenko, a dental technician, picked up his love for photography from his father, who was also a keen photographer and nature-lover.

Twenty years ago he began specialising in macro photography and now takes pictures on a Fujifilm Finepix camera.

He said: 'I spent a lot of my childhood out and about in forests as my family are big wildlife lovers so I'm always on the lookout for unusual animal shots which I can capture.

'I don't like taking just simple macro shots as you can find them everywhere so I always try to create pictures which I hope people will love.

'That's what I hope I've managed to capture with this shot because as soon as I saw the picture it reminded me of Monet's famous painting 'Lady with a Parasol.'

'I love taking pictures of snails and ants and have taken so many over the years that I could probably write a book.'
