Each year, the prettiest rodeo enthusiasts across the United State gather to compete for the title of Miss Rodeo America.

The pageant,  held in Las Vegas, Nevada, in conjunction with the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, critiques contestants in the areas of appearance, horsemanship, and personality.

And, of course, how good they look in a cowboy hat.

Then, there is the trivia.

Miss Rodeo America must know everything from the signs of colic in horses, the past winners of every major rodeo on any given year, and anything than else that has to do with the classic cattle herding sport.

Brooklyn-based photographer Gabriela Herman captured the 27 women who competed in the most recent pageant, hoping to wina grand prize of $30,000 in scholarship money and prizes - not to mention one very nice crown.

From there it is a year of photo shoots, appearances and a whole lot of hand shaking for the winner.

Herman specifically followed Nicole Schrock, the 24-year-old Miss Rodeo Oregon, who can ride a horse just as well as the boys but looks far, far better in a pair of bedazzled chaps.

Take a look at these beauties who are smart, athletic, beautiful and very, very good with a gun.
