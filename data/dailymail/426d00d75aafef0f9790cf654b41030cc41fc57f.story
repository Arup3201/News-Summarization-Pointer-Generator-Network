Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott, is alleged to have 'gone on' about wanting a bigger house

A man accused of killing six of his children in a house fire frequently spoke about wanting a bigger house, a court has heard.

It was also claimed Mick Philpott, his wife, Mairead, and friend Paul Mosley also took part in a 'rehearsal' of the fatal blaze weeks before tragedy struck.

They are alleged to have acted out how they would save the youngsters from the property once the fire took hold.

All three are accused of the manslaughter of the six children in the fire that engulfed the Philpott family home in Victory Road, Allenton in Derby, in the early hours of May 11 last year.

Giving evidence to their trial at Nottingham Crown Court, Melissa John, the girlfriend of Mosley’s nephew, said he told her after he had been arrested and bailed by police in connection with the fire that the three of them had practised the fire.

She told the court: 'He said "What if I was to tell you that we actually rehearsed this six weeks ago?"'

Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked her what the plan had been once the fire had started, and Ms John said: 'Mick and Mairead were to be inside the house and Paul was to kick in the back door.'

Mr Latham asked her: 'What were Mick and Mairead to do?' She answered: 'Run out on to the front and scream for help.'

'What was Paul to do?' Mr Latham asked. 'To save the children from the back bedroom,' Ms John replied.

The jury of five women and seven men was told that Mosley said Philpott had been 'going on about wanting a bigger house'.

The court also heard Mrs Philpott, 31,
had written in a suicide note that 'next time she will take the 
children with her', and part of the plan had been for her to take the 
blame for the fire.

Ms John also told jurors that while 
talking to Mosley round the kitchen table at her home she asked about 
the children's parents.

'I was asking him if he thought Mick 
and Mairead were actually capable of doing it and he said "I don’t know 
but if they did it's something that's gone wrong".'

Mosley, 46, was arrested in June last 
year and released on police bail. He was rearrested and charged in 
connection with the children’s deaths in November.

Jade, 10, and her brothers John, nine,
Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13, all perished 
after the fire engulfed their home as they slept in their beds.

All three defendants have denied the charges.

Ms John told jurors that Mosley was 'bragging' to a number of people about being on bail for murder.

The court heard that he told women on internet dating sites as well as an employee at the job centre and a taxi driver.

Ms John agreed with Ben Nolan QC, 
representing Mosley, when he asked her if Mosley was an 'attention 
seeker' and a 'fantasist' who used to exaggerate in order to 'big 
himself up'.

Jurors heard that, before he was 
charged over the deaths, he had told Ms John he was going to sell his 
story to the newspapers and had been offered 'millions' by a Chinese 
publication.

Mosley liked others to think he knew things they did not and would pull a 'mysterious' face at such times, Mr Nolan said.

Ms John agreed that she often did not 
believe what Mosley told her but when he told her about the 'rehearsal' 
of the fire, his demeanour changed and she believed him.

'Paul’s body language had changed from
a smug sort of body language to nervous, which is different to how I 
had seen him before.'

Covert recordings of conversations caught in a bugged hotel room between Mick and Mairead Philpott were played to the court and revealed them discussing what they told officers in the days after the blaze.

They were heard talking in the room that was being monitored 24 hours a day by Serious and Organised Crime detectives, and officers also caught on tape sexual activity between them and Mosley.

On May 16, five days following the fire and after 31-year-old Mrs Philpott’s witness evidence to police, Philpott, 56, asks his wife: ‘What did you say about me trying to get in?’

Mrs Philpott is heard to answer: ‘You tried everything you could to get in, like I said to them, I wanted to run through the flames up the stairs.’

Philpott asked: ‘Was you crying when you said it? How bad?’ She replies: ‘Not really, really bad, but I was crying.’

Mosley visited the couple in their Premier Inn room and parts of recordings were played to jurors that prosecutors said showed sexual activity between the three.

On one occasion, on May 19, Philpott 
refers to his wife performing a sex act on Mosley, which prosecutor 
Richard Latham QC said in his opening to the court was done to keep 
Mosley on side.

'I’m proud of you' // 'Hmm?' // 'I’m proud of you because you didn’t want to do it, I’m proud of you because you lied to me' // When?' // 'Well, you said you wanted to do it and you didn’t'

Dialogue between Philpott couple after sex act during which all three defendants appeared to be in the same room

Philpott asks her what is wrong, to which she replies ‘nothing’.

‘Did he try to touch you?’ he asks. ‘He tried to cuddle me,’ she replies. ‘And what did you do?’, he asks. ‘I pulled away from him,’ she says. ‘Why?’ Philpott asks. ‘It just didn’t feel right,’ she says.

‘Why? He did it in front of me,’ he says. Mrs Philpott replies: ‘I know, it just didn’t feel right.’ Philpott answers: ‘So what’s the problem?’

Audio of a sex act in which all three defendants appeared to be in the same room was played to the jury, and afterwards Philpott is heard to say to his wife: ‘I’m proud of you.’

‘Hmm?’ she replies. He says: ‘I’m proud of you because you didn’t want to do it, I’m proud of you because you lied to me.’

‘When?’ she asks. ‘Well, you said you wanted to do it and you didn’t,’ he replies.

All three defendants have denied six counts of manslaughter in relation to each of the children.In another recording on the evening of May 19, Philpott and Mosley, who is nicknamed Shakey, were heard talking.

Philpott said to Mosley: ‘We all think it’s - and the police do too - we think it’s an accident.’

‘Gone wrong?’ Mosley asked. ‘Yeah,’ Philpott replied. Mosley asked: ‘Something to scare you?’

Philpott answered: ‘Yeah and that’s unfortunate, it’s gone terribly, terribly wrong. Terribly wrong for us two.’

Philpott is heard on recordings telling people he suspected the room was being bugged by police and tells visitors he and his wife were starting to feel like suspects.

Shortly after talking to police about events on the night of the fire, Philpott is heard asking his wife: ‘Are you going to be able to cope with this now? I’ll tell you something, you know.

‘I was expecting yesterday that you were going to stray.’

She replied: ‘I bet that was you thinking exactly the same as I was thinking when you were in there doing yours.’ Philpott answered: ‘I was tempted. Was you?’ She replied: 'Yeah.’

On May 20, Philpott is heard saying he was replaying the fire in his head. ‘I keep living it over and over and over again.

‘Why couldn’t I get in the bedrooms? Why couldn’t I get my kids out? Why did the fire spread so ******* quick?’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
