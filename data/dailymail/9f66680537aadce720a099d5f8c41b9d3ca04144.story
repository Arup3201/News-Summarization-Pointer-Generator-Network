Starring role: Cocaine smuggler Gholda James, a model from the Dominican Republic, played the part of Sister Mary Roberts in Sister Act, the musical

A murderer, a drug smuggler and a child molester were allowed to star in a West End-style show inside a high-security women’s prison.

Twenty inmates featured in the £180,000 production of Sister Act, the Musical at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey last month, the Mail can reveal.

The show was put on as part of a ‘rehabilitation’ project designed to turn inmates away from crime.

But prison bosses ordered a publicity ban over the event because of fears of public outrage.

Last night victims’ groups condemned the production as ‘insensitive’.

Rose Dixon, from Support after Murder and Manslaughter, said: ‘Most victims’ families will be horrified by this.

'Yes, rehabilitation is part of the programme in prison but there must be more appropriate ways.

‘They are in there enjoying themselves when the bereaved families are totally devastated. I think it’s very insensitive.’

Prison officials said the event was allowed to go ahead because it was not paid for with public funds.

But questions were also raised about why foreign prisoners – who would be earmarked for deportation when they complete their sentences – were allowed to join in.

The show was put on at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, which holds the country’s most dangerous women offenders.

The prison is run by private firm Sodexo Justice Services,

Inmates include serial killer Joanna Dennehy and, until recently, Rose West.

An arts charity, Pimlico Opera, put on the show – based on the 1992 film starring Whoopi Goldberg – over seven nights at the end of February and start of March.

Among the ‘stars’ was drug smuggler Gholda James, a model from the Dominican Republic who was jailed last year for trying to bring £90,000 of cocaine into the country. She is serving five years.

Also on the cast was killer Sarah Anderson, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing another woman to death after a row in a South London pub in 2009.

Nigerian air stewardess Temitayo Daramola, who was locked up after trying to smuggle £600,000 of cocaine on a flight to London from Lagos last summer, also featured in the production.

The name of the convicted child abuser is not known.

They were supported by a cast of professional actors and opera singers and accompanied by a 13-piece orchestra.

Prisoners performed on a West End-style stage created by top designer Halla Groves-Raines and were trained by professional choreographers for two weeks.

Tickets were sold at £40 a head to members of the public, with around 300 available for each performance.

But all mobile phones were confiscated from audience members as part of the ban on publicity by the Prison Service.

Ian Blakeman, director of commissioning for the National Offender Management Service, said: ‘We already provide targeted offending behaviour programmes for prisoners but we also know that working with organisations like the Pimlico Opera can have a positive impact on rehabilitation and help offenders lead law-abiding lives on release.’
