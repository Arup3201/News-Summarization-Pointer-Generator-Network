Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has admitted a deal still has not been agreed with Chelsea to allow Thibaut Courtois to play in the Champions League semi-final.

UEFA will allow the Belgian goalkeeper to play against his parent club and Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay insists Courtois can feature 'if selected' by Madrid coach Diego Simeone.

However, with the La Liga leaders hoping to secure the loan of Courtois from Stamford Bridge for another season, Atletico seem reluctant to upset the Blues by playing the former Genk keeper.

Split loyalties: Thibaut Courtois will only play against Chelsea if Atletico can reach an agreement

Plan: It has been reported in Spain that Mourinho may punish the goalkeeper if he plays

In action: Courtois (right) is quickly making a name for himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe

Cerezo told reporters ahead of the La Liga clash with Getafe: ‘I do not know how many times I have to repeat this, Courtois is a Chelsea player loaned to Atletico Madrid this season.

'We’re trying to get them to give him to us for another season.

‘If we reach agreement with Chelsea he will play, because he is a Chelsea player and we are gentlemen and we deliver on what we sign.

‘I am convinced that he will play because there will be an agreement between Atletico Madrid, Chelsea and the goalkeeper.

‘And if in the end he does not play, then (Daniel) Aranzubia (Atletico's No 2 goalkeeper) will do it.’

Atletico are almost certain to have Diego Costa available for the first leg of their semi-final against Chelsea, despite him going off on Sunday night after colliding with a post.

Coach Simeone said after the match: 'Costa is fine, he is happy. He made a great effort throughout. One more cut does not do anything to this tiger.'

Let's play fair: Chelsea have made Atleti forward Diego Costa their No 1 target

Leaders: Atletico beat Getafe 2-0 on Sunday to maintain their lead at the top of La Liga
