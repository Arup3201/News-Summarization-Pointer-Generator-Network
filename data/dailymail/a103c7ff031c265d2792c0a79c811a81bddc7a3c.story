England will seek to generate try-scoring potency against the All Blacks on Saturday by unleashing another scratch combination out wide — Jonny May and Semesa Rokoduguni.

Gloucester wing May will return to the starting XV despite appearing to fall from favour on the summer tour of New Zealand and being unable to score in seven Test appearances to date. His recall on the left flank comes as Marland Yarde of Harlequins continues to recover from a minor injury which prevented him from training last week.

Stuart Lancaster, England’s head coach, has had to deal with a series of injuries in the build-up to the QBE series at Twickenham, with the loss of Wasps lock Joe Launchbury being the latest grim development.

But he and his assistants chose to omit Chris Ashton from the national squad and in his absence, Rokoduguni will start on the right as the in-form winger in the Aviva Premiership this season.

When the line-up is officially confirmed on Thursday the Fijian-born flier will be at No 14 to continue his astonishing career progression. The 27-year-old joined Bath only two years ago and is still a serving soldier in the British Army having seen action in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province as a tank driver with the famous ‘Desert Rats’ armoured brigade.

Rokoduguni will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for England since Tim Rodber 15 years ago. His Test debut will complete an epic journey from his Fijian village, Naselai, where he couldn’t break into the rugby team because his uncle was a better winger.

Having already lost Manu Tuilagi to a recurring groin injury, the coaches were forced to rule Northampton centre Luther Burrell out of the autumn opener against the world champions because of a hand problem. It will mean that England do not have established try-scoring clout behind the scrum. Among the backs who will start against New Zealand, scrum-half Danny Care has the highest tally, with seven. Mike Brown has touched down five times, Owen Farrell twice and centres Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt once.

In contrast, the All Blacks come to Twickenham armed with the most predatory finisher in the world. Julian Savea has 29 tries from 30 Test appearances. Ashton had a decent record of 19 tries in 39 matches, but he has fallen out of favour due to perceived flaws in his game.

Explaining the thinking in terms of wing selection, Lancaster said: ‘A lot of the players now — a Jack Nowell, Anthony Watson or Jonny May — are comfortable on either wing. The decision will be based on who we think are the best guys to deliver that balance in the back line — the ability to punch and get through the line, have the physicality and also have the back-field and defensive understanding that we’ll need.'

Referring to dealing with New Zealand’s kicking game, he added: ‘That reading of body language is key. That’s one thing Jonny and Jack did well in the Six Nations, particularly against Ireland — Jonny Sexton has a very accurate and intelligent kicking game. It’s about being up in the line and also reading the body language to have the back-field covered.’

After having to contend with a stream of bad news relating to players’ fitness, Lancaster had some brighter bulletins to savour on Monday. His leading available props, Joe Marler and David Wilson, were able to return to full training and Billy Vunipola has recovered from concussion sufficiently to reclaim his starting place at No 8.

Farrell appeared to be labouring on his most recent appearance for Saracens, after a month out with a quad injury, but Lancaster said: ‘There’s no residue of injury whatsoever. In terms of the way he’s making his decisions and leading the group, he’s exactly where he left off with us in the second Test (in June).’

Eastmond was another who was struggling last week, as he recovered from a rib injury. But he has been backed to line up at inside centre and make light of his first-half horror in Hamilton during England’s last Test, five months ago.

‘Kyle has come back to Bath, he’s been defensively excellent, a great attacking threat and he looks confident,’ said Lancaster.

England’s front-five options have been slashed by early- season injuries but Lancaster has no qualms about promoting Dave Attwood to partner Courtney Lawes in the second row in place of Launchbury. ‘They are quite similar players,’ he said. ‘Dave is probably a stronger right-hand lock. He is a very good scrummaging second row.

‘He has changed his game this season — he’s lost a bit of weight and played exceptionally well for Bath. It was Dave’s decision. He felt he could maintain his power but become more mobile around the field. But he’s still a big fella and he will bring a physicality to our game because of his power.’
