These are some of the most amazing holiday experiences which the majority of people have probably never heard of.

Specific Four Seasons locations offer 'Extraordinary Experiences' packages which are a selection of once-in-a-lifetime activities.

There are more than 50 of these experiences available around the world with each one remaining specific to that location.

Tourists can take advantage of the famous Golden Triangle elephant trek in Thailand in the region's traditional attraction

With stunning views of Firenze, Italy, your partner would be impressed with a Golden sunset dinner on the Ponte Vecchio

Four Seasons Budapest allows buyers to take centre stage at the Hungarian State Opera House, being served a candle-lit meal for two on the performance space while the orchestra plays in the background.

Star-crossed lovers can also share a meal in Florence, or make their own fragrance in one of Buenos Aires' most respected perfume makers.

Adventurers can take part in elephant treks at sunrise in the Golden Triangle, glacier golf at the chain's Whistler location, swim in UNESCO-protected waters in the Maldives, climb Mount Fuji or even attend pre-arranged polo matches at Palm Beach, Florida.

And for those simply looking to relax, one hotel offers an entire suit - which comes with its own infinity pool - overlooking the Shanghai skyline.

Christopher Norton, executive vice president of global product and operations at Four Seasons, revealed each experience is conceived by local Four Seasons teams

He said: 'This collection delivers on the modern luxury traveller's desire to experience something memorable and unique.'
