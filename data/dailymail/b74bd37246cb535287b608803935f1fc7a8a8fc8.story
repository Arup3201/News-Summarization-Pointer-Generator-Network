New Balance has filed a lawsuit against Karl Lagerfeld, accusing the designer of copying its logo.

Court papers, obtained by TMZ, say that the 'K' motif on the $370 new season sneakers sold under the Karl Lagerfeld label is too similar to the 'N' featured on New Balance footwear.

New Balance claims that the similarity between the two shoes' designs 'creates confusion' and points out that it has been using its 'N' logo since the Seventies.

'Although we 
cannot comment on the specifics of the case, we believe it is vital to 
actively and vigorously defend our brand.'

Prior to the lawsuit, fashion bloggers had already observed a likeness between the Karl Lagerfeld show and the New Balance design.

An article on SheFinds read: 'The only major difference between his Karl Lagerfeld Leather Suede Mesh Sneakers and [the] New Balance 574 Black Sneakers is the “K” on the sides.'

Karl Lagerfeld, the longtime creative director of Chanel, appears to be having a love affair with sneakers at the moment.

As well as issuing the 'K' sneakers from his own Karl Lagerfeld label, he created dazzling made-to-order lace and crystal kicks for his spring/summer Chanel Couture show.

While the high-end footwear is only available to buy with a full couture look, Twilight actress and Chanel face Kristen Stewart has already managed to blag a pair and was seen slipping into them after a photocall at Cannes.
