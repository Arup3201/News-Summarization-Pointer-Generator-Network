A daring man in New Zealand has been caught on camera surfing on a couch while holding onto the back of a hatchback car.

Police were left baffled by the thrill-seeker, who managed to hold on to his precious cargo while a woman drove the car. 

Other motorists were stunned to see the car towing its unusual cargo around Dunedin and managed to capture the whole thing on video.

A daring man in New Zealand has been caught on camera surfing on a couch while it was being towed behind a hatchback

Onlookers claim the man was laughing as the vehicle travelled up London St before turning onto Stuart St.

The man clung on to the vehicle for dear life, as another woman sat in the back seat of the car holding the boot of the car open. 

As sparks erupted from the bottom of the couch, the vehicle pulled over near Otago Boys' High School on Arthur St. 

At about 5.30pm, the couch surfer then decided to load the couch on to the roof of the white car, realising that his first method was ruining his beloved couch. 

The man hung his head out of the window of the car and held on to the couch as it proceeded down Arthur St and into Elm Road. 

Half of the man's body can clearly be seen outside the car, with both of his hands grasping the couch.

Speaking to the Otago Daily Times, Acting Senior Sergeant Jared Kirk, of Dunedin said the three individuals travelling in the car 'failed to engage the brain'.

'It never ceases to amaze me the lunacy of some individuals who have failed to engage the brain.

'The risks there are obvious to the people involved ... and other motorists and pedestrians. I mean, what would happen if someone had to slam on the brakes in an emergency?'

Sergeant Kirk said penalties for such actions could result in infringement notices and court appearances.
