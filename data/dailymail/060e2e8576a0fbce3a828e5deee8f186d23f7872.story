David Johnston has to be dumped as Defence Minister now - that's the view of former Liberal leader Dr John Hewson.

Dr Hewson told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Johnston was 'in real strife' and Tony Abbott had to act to stop what is 'a festering sore going into the festive season'.

'You have to nip that in the bud as fast as you can, otherwise all you have is instability and uncertainty' he said.

Defence Minister David Johnston has been embroiled in two recent controversies, revelations he indulged in a series of expensive meals with industry officials chasing lucrative government contracts and comments made that he wouldn't trust Australian Submarine Corp to 'build canoes'

Dr John Hewson, former Liberal leader, said: 'Defence has a history of being able to eat their own - we've seen it before - I think he's in real strife and I think the sooner that Abbott deals with the fact that he's not competent to be a Minister of Defence'

Dr John Hewson was the leader of the Liberal Party for four years in the 90s, contesting one federal election

'Tony Abbott may have confidence in Johnston but that leak about expenses suggests to me defence doesn't have confidence in him.

'Defence has a history of eating their own, we've seen that before happy to others - I think he (Johnston) is in real strife and I think the sooner that Abbott deals with the fact that he's not competent to be a Minister of Defence the better.'

He warned that if the PM didn't take action 'it will be a festering sore into the festive season and it will only get worse.'

He also took a swipe at the Prime Minister's assertion that a Cabinet reshuffle was on the cards.

'It's silly, if you are going to say that, the expectation there is that it is going to happen and the pressure grows for it to happen, so I guess it's better to have it sooner rather than later - you can't have it too late.' 

The Prime Minister has had to put out internal fires on several fronts, including a confrontation with Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop over plans to have her 'chaperoned' at the UN climate conference

Julie Bishop is believed to have pushed back on the plan to have her accompanied to the United Nations Climate Conference by Andrew Robb

'That was really dumb to attack her'. John Hewson thinks Tony Abbott made a big mistake in his move to have Julie Bishop 'chaperoned' at the UN meeting by Andrew Robb

Dr Hewson called Mr Abbott's planned move to have Foreign Minister Julie Bishop 'chaperoned' at the UN Climate Conference as dumb.

'That was really dumb to attack her,' he  said, agreeing that she, along with Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, were the star performers in Cabinet this past year.

'That's right, and she recognises the inevitability of the fact that next year in the course of the run-up to the Paris meeting that the world is going to move towards an emissions reduction target and we should be part of that process, it means the government has to change some of its policy,' Dr Hewson added. 

'Tony would be dismayed that the government has had success in foreign affairs and immigration, things like MH17 for instance but that he would be 10 points behind in the polls and not the preferred Prime Minister,' Dr Hewson said.

Treasurer Joe Hockey has, meantime tried to brush aside claims some colleagues want him dumped, in favour of Malcolm Turnbull.

When asked on Radio 3AW whether Joe Hockey was safe as treasurer, the PM replied 'of course, of course' .. going on to call him a man of 'remarkable resilience, focus and grit'.

Under pressure. There are increasing calls for David Johnston to be dumped as Defence Minister but the Prime Minister is sticking by him

Under pressure. There are reports senior Cabinet members are angling for Joe Hockey's removal as Treasurer in favour of Malcolm Turnbull but he too has the PM's support

'I rate Joe very highly indeed and the public should do too,' he told reporters on Friday.

'He has tackled this (the Budget) with a will, with a purpose, with a single mindedness and strength of character.'

Asked in an interview with the ABC's 7.30 program whether it was time to reshape the Coalition front-bench, Mr Abbott said: 'At some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good front-bench.'

'Joe Hockey has been criticised lately, but I tell you what, I think Joe is going to be one of the great treasurers because he's someone who bounces back and that's what he's doing now,' Mr Abbott said. 

'Joe Hockey has been criticised lately, but I tell you what, I think Joe is going to be one of the great treasurers because he's someone who bounces back and that's what he's doing now,' Mr Abbott said

Mr Hockey also dismissed as 'silly' the questions about his future. He is due to hand down his mid-year budget review within the next fortnight.

Dr Hewson said if he was either David Johnston or Joe Hockey, he would be very uncomfortable at hearing they had the Prime Minister's backing.

'Maybe I'm a bit cynical but I would be worried if I was Johnston or Hockey to hear that the Prime Minister say he has absolute confidence in them, many times that can turn out negative,' he to Daily Mail Australia.

Daily Mail Australia has sought comment from Mr Johnston, his office again stressing that he continues to have the PM's support.
