After the school run and household chores, one suburban mom gets on with her other business of the day - running a revenge porn website.

Ariella Alexander, who operates under the fake name from her home in Maryland, has set up a site where wives can post pictures of their husbands' alleged mistresses and stories of the sordid affairs.

Alexander, who is acting within the law, posts the often intimate pictures of the alleged 'homewreckers' along with the women's names and where they live.

The mother, who also runs a blog where she documents her cheating ex-husband's affairs, said that she believes some of the alleged mistresses enjoy the attention that her site brings.

She claims that betrayed married women from across the country have sent her more than 1,000 pictures.

It is unclear how much money Alexander makes from her business but the website has a number of ad placements.

The sad tales of loyalty betrayed and marriages destroyed fill Alexander's site in an endless scrolling list.

One heartbroken wife from Florida writes: 'Thanksgiving day 2013, I discovered... all the filthy deleted texts. The horrible I love you’s the descriptions of having sex in the stockroom at work. The talk of how they had sex, where they had sex and what they did to each other... The affair had been going on so long I felt sick to my stomach.'

In another a Texas woman sent topless pictures to the website of her daughter's fourth-grade teacher whom her husband was allegedly having an affair.

Alexander's site takes a new spin on revenge porn. Previous cases have seen men post graphic pictures of their former girlfriends and wives in order to humiliate them.

The mom runs the revenge porn site from her Maryland home which allows women to name and shame their husband's alleged mistresses - often including graphic pictures

Alexander's site, 
shesahomewrecker.com, names and shames the women accused of sleeping 
with other women's husbands - with the role of the men in these alleged affairs featuring far 
less prominently on the blame scale.

The alleged mistresses are tagged with long streams of insults and expletives - 'fat cow', 'b****', d********' and 'pitiful, homewrecking tramp'. 

Revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them.

California and New Jersey passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including Maryland, where shesahomewrecker.com operates - are considering a change in legislation.

Kevin Bollaert, who ran a California-based revenge porn site, was arrested this week after extorting victims out of thousands of dollars.

He was charged with 31 felonies pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in from the subjects' ex-partners.

When women contacted Bollaert begging to have their picture and personal details removed, he required that they transfer $350 to an account linked to another one of his sites- changemyreputation.com.

Alexander has no remorse for her site and shrugs off responsibility over the fact that she has no proof that these women actually are the cheating mistresses they are made out to be.

She told America Tonight: 'I can’t be certain for anything I read 
on the Internet if it’s true or not.

'I mean, you can’t be certain. 
Somebody’s telling a story.'

Alexander also edits the photos she receives - often naked selfies of other women that scorned wives have taken off cheating husbands' cell phones.

She won't post naked pictures of women in their early twenties but of those in their thirties, forties or fifties? 

'You know better at that age' is her response.

The suburban mom appears to view her website as a public service for married women.

Alexander told GMA: 'I think if one woman says, ''Oh my god, I do not want to end up on this website''...because your life is going to be destroyed.'

Under current legislation - the Communications Decency Act of 1996 - Alexander is not doing nothing wrong. Section 230 of the Act says that website operators are not legally liable for the words of third parties.

And Alexander's website comes with a very clear disclaimer: 'The content of all posts and comments on Shesahomewrecker.com represent the opinions of the original poster and are not endorsed, approved or representations of the opinions of Shesahomewrecker.com or its owners.'

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Alexander.

Alexander also runs her own blog where she documents her ex-husband's cheating ways
