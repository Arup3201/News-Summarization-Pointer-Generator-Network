He has racked up a record 54 penalty points on his licence but Keith Baldock has been allowed to carry on driving.

The unemployed 34-year-old is believed to be the only motorist in Britain legally on the road despite such a shocking catalogue of convictions.

He begged a judge to let him keep his
 licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter.

No ban: Keith Baldock, of Herne Bay, Kent, is believed to be the only driver in Britain to be legally on the road despite having more than 50 points on a licence. He is pictured here with an unknown woman

A mistake by
 the court meant the judge was unaware of Baldock’s previous offences – 
and that he should already have been banned.

Ordinarily, just 12 points are enough for disqualification, but Baldock persuaded the court he was a special case.

Last
 night road safety campaigners said the case undermined the system to 
protect the public from ‘selfish and dangerous drivers’, and called for 
the law to be overhauled.

Baldock,
 a father-of-two from Herne Bay, Kent, who lost his job as a tyre fitter
 two years ago, had already been banned for a year in 2010 for 
drink-driving.

In court: Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl said Balcok was 'a lucky man indeed', adding that the case was closed

Last year he was given a one-year supervision order for stealing petrol worth £500 from garages.

The legal limit for a driving ban in Britain is 12 points on a licence.

But courts can choose against enforcing a ban in cases where it would cause ‘exceptional hardship’, and fine the driver instead.

Following
 the sentencing, if new evidence emerges of points that have been 
clocked up on a driver’s record, this can be submitted to the Crown 
Prosecution Service.

However,
 any variation in ‘the substance of a sentence’ must be made within 56 
days of the original sentencing. In Baldock’s case, this time period had
 already passed.

Then
 in November, Baldock was hit with 30 penalty points after being 
convicted of driving without insurance on five separate occasions. He 
was also convicted of stealing fuel from cars.

But
 when he appeared in the dock at Canterbury Crown Court, a mistake meant
 the court was unaware he had already accumulated 24 points from 
previous offences.

Baldock 
then argued he had turned to stealing out of ‘desperation’ to feed his 
family after his Jobseeker’s Allowance was stopped.

Judge
 Nigel Van Der Bijl fined Baldock £500 and said: ‘I am making no order 
for disqualification because if he is looking for work he will need a 
car.’

It was not until this
 week that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency realised Baldock 
already had 24 points and informed the Crown Prosecution Service.

Too late: Prosecutors approached Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) with the new evidence, but the law states any variation in 'the substance of a sentence' must be made within 56 days

Baldock holds the record for the most penalty points of any motorist legally on the road.

He has beaten a motorist from Liverpool who clocked up a former record of 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree.

The
 driver got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose 
the identity of the driver or for speeding between October 2012 and June
 2013. That man's total exceeded the previous record of 42 points.

The third-highest total, 36, goes to a man from Warrington, Cheshire, who was caught driving without insurance six times in less than two weeks between February and March 2012.

A woman from Lincoln is fourth with 34
 points, after being caught speeding three times and failed to give 
information to identify the driver four times over nine months in 2012.

The
 CPS told the court, but the law states any variation in ‘the substance 
of a sentence’ must be made within 56 days – making it too late to 
change Baldock’s.

Prosecutor
 Francis Lloyd told Canterbury Crown Court: ‘At the earlier hearing he 
was not  disqualified, but in fact he should have been unless there was 
exceptional hardship.

‘Unfortunately there is not a great deal we can do about it now – he’s a lucky fellow.’

Judge Van Der Bijl replied: ‘A lucky man indeed. Case closed.’

Last
 night Baldock admitted: ‘The judge gave me 30 points – and I knew I 
already had 24 points. I was quite shocked when I found out that I 
hadn’t been banned.

‘I expected to get an 18-months to two-year ban and a hefty fine. I got a £500 fine.’

Speaking
 from a farm where he lives in Herne Bay, he said: ‘It’s a f*** up from 
the DVLA and the judge. I should have been banned.’

A close friend said: ‘He’s got to be the luckiest man in Britain. We had a good laugh about it.’

The friend added: ‘Keith did a hop, skip and a jump out of the courtroom and he’s been hopping and skipping around the farm.’

But
 Ellen Booth, of road safety charity Brake, said: ‘The penalty points 
system exists to protect the public from selfish and dangerous drivers 
who repeatedly take life-threatening risks on roads.

‘But
 this protection is undermined every time a driver who reaches 12 points
 is allowed to keep their licence, particularly so when we’re talking 
about drivers who have accumulated very high numbers of points.

‘By
 the time you have reached 12 points, you’ve had multiple opportunities 
to turn your behaviour around. If you need your licence, look after it.’

The Institute of Advanced
 Motorists is calling for the system to be re-examined. Chief executive 
Simon Best said: ‘The DVLA must rapidly overhaul their systems and 
working relationships with the courts to ensure that the whole principle
 of “12 points and you are off the road” is not undermined.’

The DVLA declined to comment on the case.
