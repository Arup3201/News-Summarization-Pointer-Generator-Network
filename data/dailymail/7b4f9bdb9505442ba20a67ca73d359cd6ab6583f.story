When Tiffany Spears told police she was convinced a hole was slowly appearing in her shop wall, she was branded a joker - and told she must have seen a ghost.

But just weeks later the small gap in the wall from the empty cafe next door to her shop in Fleetwood, Lancashire, erupted - bringing with it a masked raider.

CCTV cameras captured the intruder squeezing through a gap on his stomach and creeping to the till to steal £100 from the Best One shop in the early hours of Monday.

Cameras watched as he crept his way past rows of alcohol and to the till

The CCTV captured the man rifling through the till wearing a pair of gloves and a balaclava obscuring his face

He then made his way back through the gap, with his haul in hand

Miss Spears, 22, said: 'The police haven’t believed a word I’ve told them.

'They’ve  called me a joker, they’ve suggested I’ve seen a ghost, or maybe a mouse.

'But
 they can’t deny there’s an obvious hole in the wall that has got bigger
 and bigger, and now we’ve actually seen someone come through it with 
the sole intention to steal from us.

'I even started to doubt myself because they just wouldn’t believe me.'

Miss
 Spears and her partner Richard Anthony, 33, became increasingly 
concerned about the hole - made from the empty Cornflower cafe next door -
 which she claims she first told officers about five weeks ago.

Since
 then, she claims to have even seen someone looking at her through the 
hole, from the store’s stock room, which has been made directly next to 
the building’s alarm system.

'It’s
 terrifying for me,' she said. 'I work here alone almost all the time in
 the knowledge that someone is watching me from next door waiting for 
their chance to get in here.

Tiffany Spears who runs Best One Shop in Fleetwood, was branded a 'joker' after claiming that someone had been slowly creating a hole in the wall of her shop

'When
 they finally kicked through the wall and came through, the CCTV showed 
it was literally seconds before I came in to start work.

'They’ve got no fear, they’ll go to extreme lengths and I feel like they’re watching my every move.#

Officers were forced to take notice when they were shown the incriminating footage recorded on the store’s security cameras.

Police are now investigating the theft and have launched a public appeal for information.

Inspector
 Steve Bell has also said he is sorry if the couple felt that they had not been 
supported by the police.

But the 
couple, who have suffered a catalogue of harassment from youths and an 
earlier burglary at the premises, say it is too little too late.

Miss Spears said she had launched an official complaint about the way police have dealt with their reports.

'Since we moved in it has been a nightmare, with one things and another. We have been under siege.'

In
 February, the newsagents was broken into when raiders smashed a window 
at the rear and stole cash, forcing the couple to brick it up.

The moment the intruder broke through the wall was captured on instore CCTV

Miss Spears said: 'The police haven't believed a word I've told them. They've  called me a joker, they've suggested I've seen a ghost, or maybe a mouse'

Mr
 Anthony, originally from Sri Lanka, says he has also been assaulted by 
groups of youths and subjected to racial abuse and shoplifting.

Last month Miss Spears says she opened up the shop for business and was terrified when a knife came through the wall.

It
 was the start of the hole being made. Despite calling the police, she 
says the terrifying incident was not dealt with seriously.

The couple, who also run another newsagents, say they cannot quit the business because they own it and it is their livelihood. 

Mr Anthony said: 'We’re just trying to run our business.'

Inspector
 Bell added: 'The problems this couple have encountered are completely 
unacceptable and we will do our very best to bring these perpatrators to
 justice.

'I am 
genuinely sorry that Richard and Tiffany dont feel fully supported by 
the police. We will continue to work closely with them and have put a 
number of measures in place to help with that.

'They are just trying to go about their business and we will do all we can to help them.

'We are appealing for information and ask people who might know anything to get in touch.'
