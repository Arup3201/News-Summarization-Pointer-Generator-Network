Ephrian Myles, 47, will spend a year behind bars for pouring hot sauce on a puppy

A Sarasota, Florida man who doused a puppy with hot sauce has been sentenced to one year in county jail.

On Thursday 47-year-old Ephrian Myles pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges.

Circuit Judge Donna Berlin also ordered him to serve 18 months of probation and to complete an anger management course.

She told Myles he is not to own a pet or live in a house where there are animals.

The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports that Myles became annoyed with his girlfriend Kelly Ripley's 3-month-old dachshund-chihuahua mix named Gizmo and poured hot sauce on the dog.

Authorities say the hot sauce got in the dog's eyes and throat.

Fox reports that that officers Jessica Sullivan and Adam Arena met Ripley at a fire station near her apartment after Ripley alerted the authorities.

The two officers washed the hot sauce off of the dog with water and a towel and the dog was turned over to Animal Services.

Investigating officers who went to the woman's house on the 3500 block of Old Bradenton Road said they saw a pool of hot sauce on the floor.

'It couldn't open its eyes,' Officer Sullivan told Fox.

'One eyes was completely swollen shut and the other was barely open.'

'I picked it up, looked at it, brought it to my face, and I could smell the pepper and the vinegar. I looked at [Officer Arena] and was like, this dog has hot sauce on it,' Sullivan said.

When officer Arena confronted Myles about the attack, he denied having anything to do with the assault before he was arrested.

Myles had prior convictions so his one year sentence could have been a lot worse.

The puppy was treated for neurological problems and later adopted by new owners.

'It was a good resolution,' Assistant State Attorney Dan Yuter told the Sarasota Herald Tribune. 'There were some problems with the case. There wasn't an eye witness, no direct evidence. I'm just glad the dog was OK and the guy went to jail
