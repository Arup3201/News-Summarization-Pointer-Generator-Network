A doctor’s toddler daughter drowned after she slipped off his shoulders while he was taking photos and plunged into a swollen river.

Coventry-based anaesthesiologist Megha Reddy screamed for help as 18-month-old Manvi disappeared under the water and was washed downstream in strong currents.

A frantic search was launched for the girl and rescue divers pulled her body out of the river more than four miles away.
