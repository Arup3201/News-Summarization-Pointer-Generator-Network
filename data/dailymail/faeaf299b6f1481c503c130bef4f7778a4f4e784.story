The holidays are the best time to work in childcare, according to new research which reveals the majority parents in the US are willing to fork out far more cash to nannies and babysitters during the festive season than at any other time of the year. 

A new survey from childcare website Urban Sitter, which questioned 400 parents about their holiday habits, indicates that 53 per cent confessing that they will spend up to 1.5 times the normal rate during the festive period so that they can enjoy the evening without worrying about their children.

According to Urban Sitter's annual childcare rate survey, this means that a babysitter caring for two children in New York City could earn a whopping $25.14 an hour, while those working in San Francisco could rake in $26.52 per hour.

Lucrative business: Babysitters and nannies are in high demand during the holidays, particularly on New Year's Eve

And that's not the only money that babysitters are set to make this holiday; 34 per cent of people will tip their babysitter between $25 and $50, regardless of what hours they have worked.

Unsurprisingly, New Year's Eve was shown to be the busiest night for babysitters and nannies, with 74 per cent of parents admitting that they book childcare for the night at least one month in advance, to ensure their party plans are not disrupted.

10 per cent of those moms and dads included in the survey even admitted to securing their New Year's babysitter more than two months in advance so as not to run into any last-minute childcare nightmares.

Full-time nannies also tend to benefit during this time of the year, with three quarters of parents revealing that they offer a minimum of one week's pay as a year-end bonus, with many increasing that to two weeks in light of the festive season.

77 per cent of those surveyed also ensure that they have at least one gift to give their nanny, as a thank you for all their hard work throughout the year.  

A lucky third of full-time nannies are even given a one-week break from their duties so that they can return home and spend time with their own family and friends. 

But while parents are willing to shell out big bucks in order to secure and reward their nannies and babysitters during the holidays, many revealed that they are far more frugal when it comes to the presents for their children.

39 per cent said that they spend less that $100 per child on gifts, however one third admitted to forking out between $200 and $500 on their significant other.
