Children aged just four could sit exams soon after starting primary school, under proposed education reforms.

Under the Government plans, ‘baseline’ tests to monitor pupils’ progress will be moved forward from age seven to reception year by 2016, it was reported.

The new tests are expected to encourage teachers to make sure younger children make quick progress in their learning.

But the proposals - created after a consultation exercise last year - have raised fears among parents and education leaders who claim the tests could place too much stress on young children and pupils being grouped by ability.

There are also concerns that the news tests could provide an incentive for teachers to keep test scores low to maximise their progress when they sit national curriculum tests at 11-years-old.

According to The Times, the Department for Education (DfE) has proposed that baseline assessments could include a simple check administered by a teacher between two and six weeks after a child started in the reception year.

Results would be checked via an external monitoring system.

Separate plans to rank children according to their scores in new tests that would be taken at the end of primary school have been scrapped after strong opposition from teachers, as have proposals to tell parents how their child’s score ranked within ten bands of national results.

Tests for 11-year-olds will also be changed with results to be reported as a ‘scaled score’ between 80 and 130 points rather than levels, such as Level 4 or Level 5.

Head teachers could choose from different types of assessments for four-year-olds which best suits their curriculum and school environment.

However, critics argue it is near impossible to design accurate tests for children so young because they can react badly to unfamiliar settings and make rapid progress within weeks.

Tests may also have to be taken at different stages because those with autumn birthdays are almost a whole school year older than classmates born in the summer.

Some schools may be allowed to opt out but it is unlikely as pupils’ progress from age four to 11 will be a key indicator of a school’s performance.

The tests could involve a 20 minute on-to-one assessment with a teacher within a month of a child entering reception, which assesses a pupils’ ability in reading, maths, word sounds and short-term memory.

A DfE spokeswoman said: ‘We have consulted on our proposed primary school assessment and accountability measures and we are considering our response.’
