Two men in a helicopter have saved a birthing southern right whale in Western Australia from an imminent shark attack- and luckily, one of the men on board was able to photograph the extraordinary sequence of events

On Wednesday, tourism operator Sean Blocksidge was flying on a helicopter with his friend, helicopter pilot Brett Campany, taking aerial photographs off the coast of Cowaramup Bay, south of the Margaret River in Western Australia.

From a great height, they first spotted the calving whale - and almost immediately after, a predator shark heading straight for the helpless mammal in the shallows.

'As we flew by the Wilyabrup cliffs about 1500 feet in the air, Brett and I spotted something. It looked like a really big fish from that high up! On closer inspection, we realised that it was a Southern Right Whale giving birth,' Mr Blocksidge told Daily Mail Australia.

A story in photographs: From 1500 feet, Sean Blocksidge and Brett Campany spotted what looked like 'a really big fish' (photographed from the helicopter, pictured bottom right) close to shore off the coast of Cowaramup Bay. The friends soon realised that they had found a southern right whale giving birth to her calf.

Brett Campany dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from a calving southern right whale off the coast of Cowaramup Bay

'We get more than 30,000 whales migrating along the west coast at peak season every year. We see whales all the time, you'll see at least one a day.

'So you get to understand whale behaviour. I'd seen a whale calving quite recently so I knew what was happening when I saw the whale on Wednesday. You could tell that she was giving birth because they come close to shore and have certain mannerisms.They come close to the water's surface and arch their backs.'

It was then that the pair spotted the bronze whaler shark and with only seconds to react, took it upon themselves to prevent the inevitable tragedy.

Whilst watching the pregnant whale in the shallows, Mr Campany spotted a four-metre shark (pictured) in the distance, heading straight for the whale

'We could see a shark moving down the beach. You could tell, it was coming quite quickly. It was massive, about four metres long and heading straight for the southern right.

'We only had seconds to think about it. There was no time, but we had to do something.'

'I mean, I'm all for letting nature do it's thing. We wouldn't normally interfere at all but it would be too sad if we left the shark to attack the brand new calf right after the poor mother gave birth.'

Mr Campany dropped the helicopter down and closed in on the shark, to chase it away from the vulnerable calving whale and towards deeper waters.

Throughout the whole ordeal, Mr Blocksidge kept taking photographs - a courageous task considering his chopper door was open the entire time.

'It was pretty cool to see what the helicopter could do. We turned sideways at one point when we were directly over the shark. I'd left my door open while I took photographs to get a better shot, so I was pretty nervous when I was hanging sideways directly over the shark with nothing between us!'

'It all happened so quickly but I just tried to keep clicking to get some photos. The shark high-tailed it out of there very quickly, he got a pretty big fright, I think,' Mr Blocksidge said.

'We couldn't believe what was happening, things just kept popping up before our eyes, it didn't seem real!' said Mr Blocksidge.

'We were near Williaborough beach and landed on the sand to give the whale plenty of space, because we didn't want to disturb her. We didn't want to stress the poor whale while she gave birth, but we were keeping an eye on her to make sure she was okay.

Mr Campany landed the helicopter on the sand once the shark had been herded away from the whale and out to deeper water. From a safe distance, the men both watched the whale in the shallows

'A pod of about 20 dolphins arrived to circle the birthing whale, it was really quite amazing - like the call of nature. We decided to fly off before the whale gave birth because we knew she was safe. The dolphins made a ring around her to protect her.

'We had a laugh and said well, we can leave because we know the dolphins are here to manage the maternity ward for the night!' said Mr Blocksidge.

'It was just amazing - nature at work. It's something you never forget.'

'It was like nature's call!' Mr Blockside and Mr Campany were amazed when a pod of around 20 dolphins arrived, encircling the expectant mother whale to protect her. The men left, assured the whale was safe with the dolphins there to 'manage the maternity ward.'
