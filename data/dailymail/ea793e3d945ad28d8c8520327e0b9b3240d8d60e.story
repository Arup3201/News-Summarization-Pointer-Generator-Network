Harry Potter author JK Rowling has attacked the ‘ranting’ debate over independence

Harry Potter author JK Rowling has attacked the ‘ranting’ debate over independence which has seen support for independence surge.

The English-born writer, who sparked anger among nationalists after donating £1million to the ‘No’ campaign, called for calm amid growing tensions between the rival campaigns ahead of next week’s referendum.

Scottish MP Jim Murphy was forced to pull out of a campaigning tour against independence amid intimidation tactics by separatists. 

Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone meanwhile has claimed she no longer feels safe in Scotland because of the abuse she has received after speaking out against independence.

The Glasgow-born and based Ultimo founder was subjected to a vitriolic social media hate campaign after becoming one of only a few business leaders to come out in favour of the Union.

Miss Rowling said not all nationalists were ‘haters’ – but called for a more reasoned debate before the September 18 poll.

Her intervention come after a poll put the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time, sparking panic in Westminster.

A YouGov survey for the Sunday Times found that the pro-independence campaign, led by the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, had a two point lead of 51 per cent over the unionists’ 49 per cent.

On Saturday, however, Rowling wrote on Twitter: ‘People before flags, answers not slogans, reason not ranting.’

Miss Rowling has previously accused Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond of ‘scaremongering’ over the threat to the NHS in Scotland if it stays in the UK.

Mr Salmond has claimed the health service can only be protected from ‘privatisation’ in an independent Scotland, even though policy is already fully devolved to Edinburgh.

Miss Rowling is married to Dr Neil Murray, a former hospital doctor in Edinburgh who is now a GP, and has donated millions of pounds to tackling multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases.

In June she was subjected to a torrent of online abuse by Scottish nationalists after giving £1million to the No campaign.

Miss Rowling’s latest intervention came as leading Scottish footballers declared their support for a No vote in the referendum.

The players, who include former Scotland internationals Ally McCoist, Alan Hansen and Denis Law, said: ‘We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom.’

Three former British ambassadors have also urged Scottish voters not to ‘return to the tribe’ as an isolated nation on the world stage.

In an open letter, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, former Ambassador to the United Nations, Sir John Holmes, former Ambassador to France, and Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former Ambassador to the United States, warn that Nato and the EU ‘will not hugely welcome’ an independent Scotland.

Independence will cost investment and cause ‘massive upheaval and risk for both Scots and all other Britons’, they say.
