The last 12 months have been the safest for air travel with only one fatal accident in every 2.5 million flights.

Despite a number of high profile crashes, such as the devastating Boeing 737 crash in Pakistan that killed 127 people, 2012 has been a significantly safer year for air travel than 2011.

The number of fatal crashes this year and the number of people killed in those crashes fell sharply compared, according to figures released today.

Safety in numbers: The number of fatal crashes this year and the number of people killed sharply compared to 2011, according to figures released by flight advisory service Ascend

The fatal accident rate of one per 2.5 million flights makes 2012 the safest year on record and almost twice as safe as 2011, flight advisory service Ascend said.

There were 15 plane crashes involving deaths in 2012, compared with 25 in the previous 12 months, according to the figures which relate to airliner safety.

The number of people killed in fatal crashes this year was 362 compared to 403 in 2011.

Nearly three quarters of the 362 deaths in 2012 resulted from two crashes.

When a Bhoja Air Boeing 737 crashed near Islamabad airport in Pakistan in April 20 a total of 127 people were killed.

The plane's fuel tank caught fire only three miles from the airport and is reported to have exploded in midair.

Record: There were 15 plane crashes involving deaths in 2012, compared to 25 in the previous 12 months. The number of people killed in fatal crashes this year was 362 compared to 403 in 2011

Wreckage: Remains of the DANA Air plane which crashed while approaching Lagos airport in Nigeria, killing all 153 passengers

The 32-year-old jet was first used by British Airways.

In June, all 153 passengers on a DANA Air plane died when it crashed while approaching Lagos airport in Nigeria.

A further 10 people were killed when the plane crashed into print works and residential buildings in the busy Iju-Ishaga suburb.

Ascend said the passenger death rate for the last five years was about one per 6.1 million passengers, while the rate was one per 3.7 million for the period between 2000 and 2009.

The rates have steadily increased since the 1990s when the rate was one per 1.8 million flights.

Horror: Wreckage from the 32-year-old jet, which first saw service with British Airways, was scattered across a wide area in fields about three miles from the airport in Pakistan

Insurance claims for loss of airliners in 2012 were worth approximately $980 million dollars (Â£612 million) - the lowest level since 1991.

Paul Hayes, head of safety at Ascend, said: '2012 does not represent a new norm for the world airlines.

'Nonetheless, airline fatal accident rates have been steadily improving and on average, operations are now twice as safe as they were 15 years ago.

'About 335 fewer passengers and crew were killed each year in the last decade than during the 1990s.'
