Michelle Obama has revealed why she encourages her daughters to play tennis as she attended the first day of the U.S. Open.

The First Lady, who was introduced by Serena Williams, used the start of the tennis competition to further promote her Let's Move campaign at the Arthur Ashe Kids' Day in Queens, New York.

'It’s a great way to stay healthy, to 
stay fit, it’s a lifelong sport, it’s something I’ve tried to tell my 
kids - I forced them into playing tennis ... it’s a great way to stay active,' Mrs Obama said.

The First Lady also praised King, who was at the children's day which traditionally opens the U.S. Open, calling her a 'living legend' who means so much to women and young athletes.

King won 20 Wimbledon titles during her career, and fought for equal pay for women after learning to play tennis on public courts by her Long Beach, California home.

Mrs Obama told the crowd where she was raised, on Chicago's South Side, no one played tennis, according to ABC News.

'I didn’t have 
tennis role models, I didn’t live in a community where there were any 
tennis courts, and quite frankly I don’t think I knew a single person 
when I was young who even knew how to play tennis,' she said.

However, she said the sport was a great way to improve the body and mind and that she pushed her daughters, Sasha and Malia, to learn to play so they wouldn't struggle with it like she did when she first took to a court.

'You’re going to learn things like hard 
work, teamwork, discipline. That’s why playing sports is so important, 
and that’s what sports teaches you,' she said.

'It teaches you that if you keep on 
practicing, and giving 100 per cent to anything you do, you will get 
better at it, and that’s not just true on the tennis court, but that’s 
also true in the classroom.'

The First Lady thanked the U.S. Tennis Association for helping her fitness campaign by pledging thousands of dollars to to build courts, train instructors and give lessons to hundreds of thousands of pupils.
