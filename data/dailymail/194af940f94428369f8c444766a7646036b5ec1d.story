A disabled Rhode Island man suffered a seizure and died after a thief stole his dog carrier in Woonsocket on Monday.

Stuart Gast Jr, 33, was walking his beloved chihuahua named Oreo when someone stole the carrier.Â  He chased the thief around 200 yards but accidentally injured the dog by dragging it by its leash.

Friends say Gast became distraught, had a seizure and died later that
 night. Family friend Lisa Jean believes he died of a broken heart. The thief got away.

Tragic: Stuart Gast died from a seizure after becoming distraught after a thief stole his beloved chihuahua's carrier

Distraught: The incident happened at around 10 am on Monday. Gast gave up chasing the thief after he realized the six-pound dog couldn't keep up and had hurt its paws. He died of a seizure hours later

Gast's family say he was developmentally disabled and had epilepsy, but he 
hadn't had a seizure in more than eight years before suffering one on
Monday.

'I can't even find the words to explain how badly I feel about this,' Jean told The Call. 'There aren't any. You can't even take your dog for a walk anymore without something like this happening.'

Gast's mother, Rachel Currier, said the incident happened at around 10 am on Monday and her son gave up chasing the thief after he realized the six-pound dog couldn't keep up and had hurt its paws.

Currier explained to The Call that Gast couldn't calm down after this. 'The whole time he was stewing and brewing,' she said.

Sportsman: Gast (right) was a keen runner in the Special Olympics relay team, was the captain of a bowling team and loved to watch football and eat

'He ended up hurting the pads on Oreo's feet and that just hounded him something awful.'

The
 man lived in the same apartment as his parents and when Currier heard a
 thud in his bedroom she went into the room to find her son having a seizure.

Medics managed to revive him four times but didn't succeed on the fifth occasion.

Currier told the Providence Journal that her only child was a keen runner in the Special Olympics relay team, was the captain of a bowling team and loved to watch football and eat.

'He was so active. He was my social butterfly,' she said.

The mother said the 'hardest thing I ever had to do' was pick the clothes to bury her son in. She chose his Special Olympics uniform and black jogging pants.
