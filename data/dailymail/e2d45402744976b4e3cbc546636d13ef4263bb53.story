It was early evening in Ipanema and a crowd had gathered outside a boisterous bar. Young and yellow-shirted, they stared through the window where a widescreen television was showing Brazil’s opening World Cup match with Croatia. They were drinking beer and dancing their delight at the third Brazilian goal when the police car approached.

It was moving slowly, with lights flashing. Two officers sat impassively at the front and behind sat a third man, his face obscured and his arm hanging through the open window. His hand held a large gun, whose muzzle swung in an indolent arc, sweeping the street, the bar and the dancers. As the car rounded the corner, a few youngsters shouted discreet abuse. But the moment passed and soon they returned to the football.

Now clearly it would be quite wrong to read too much into a single, disturbing cameo. Having spent five World Cup weeks in the fascist dictatorship of Argentina in 1978, I am aware that Brazil is no totalitarian state. But it is a land beset by savage inequality and social division, where order is frequently preserved by the fear of force, where threats are blatant and menace is meaningful.

Armed and dangerous: Riot police stand at the ready during an anti-World Cup protest march on Copacabana beach

Those seething tensions have found a focus in widespread resentment of the £11 billion World Cup investment. The fantasy that such a nation would cheerfully abandon its problems in favour of a month-long samba party has not survived the opening week of this tournament.

Yet, for all that, this simple game exerts a powerful hold upon the country’s imagination. From the cradle they are made aware of the part that football played in shaping the nation. And the history is cherished. On the eve of the finals, a stream of pilgrims gathered at the statue of Bellini at the entrance to the Maracana. There, holding high the Jules Rimet trophy, stands the captain of the team of ’58, Brazil’s first world champions. Fathers posed alongside sons, requesting strangers to take their picture. Elderly ladies looked on, remembering those distant days, understanding the significance. Small boys studied the bronze plaques at the base of the figure, each bearing the names of the five world-conquering teams.

One or two read some of those names aloud and, fanciful though it sounds, they seemed to relish the familiar resonance. The year of ’58 gave us the likes of Djalma Santos and Garrincha, in ’62 we had Didi and Vava, in ’70 Tostao and Gerson, in ’94 Romario and Ronaldo, in ’02 Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos.

And, of course, Pele. Always Pele, the nonpareil, the spirit of Brazil. It is not so much a list, more a litany. If you wish to understand football’s place in the Brazilian psyche, then the answers will be found in the shadow of Bellini.

So if their love for the game is beyond question, then how to explain the recent poll in which 60 per cent of the population asserted that this World Cup was a bad thing for Brazil. Again, the reason lay in the staggering expenditure — £2bn on stadiums, more than £9bn on attendant infrastructure. And which sporting body formulates the swollen demands, lays down the conditions of contract and generally creates the climate in which such grotesque sums change hands? It is, of course, FIFA, that self-serving group of cheats, chancers and rampant rascals, along with the president whose tolerance of the intolerable has done so much to establish the image which his organisation enjoys today.

Survival instinct: Sepp Blatter is posed to lead FIFA for a fifth term as president

Say what you will about Sepp Blatter — and so reduced is his reputation that we find ourselves able to say quite a lot — but marvel at his ability to survive for so long. As my favourite columnist once remarked when describing a fictional character: ‘He could not be fishier if he came with a side helping of mushy peas.’

Bribery, corruption, the selling of favours, the fixing of bids; although not personally involved in any of these activities, Blatter reacts to the deeds of the various miscreants with bogus indignation and a brass-necked refusal to recognise squalid reality.

In an organisation blessed with even a smidgeon of self-respect, the extraordinary Sunday Times vote-fixing revelations would have  produced carnage on the executive floor and instant extinction for the president. But FIFA is different. Instead, Blatter accuses the British media of ‘racism’ and in doing so he succeeds in sinking below his own shabby standards. His recent actions have reeked of a worrying eccentricity; the crass contradictions, the clumsy jests, the cringe-making dancing.

Last week, he came up with a back-of-an-envelope plan to protest a  couple of decisions in every match. This, of course, is  just what football needs: more dissent, more anarchy, More anger. And this from the  most influential individual in the world game. It was genuinely pathetic, a crude attempt at diversion and distraction. Truly, Blatter is the Bad Fairy at this particular party.

Now, some insist that the organisation is rotten beyond reform, that it must be swept away and replaced by a new institution with radical ideas about valuing the game more dearly than the money it may generate.

Restoring order: Jacques Rogge transformed the IOC

And they may be right, although such a counsel of despair ignores the example of the International Olympic Committee, similarly infested by sharks and charlatans until a Belgian physician called Jacques Rogge restored a rich measure of order, honour and all those qualities which are currently far beyond the reach of FIFA.

But that will take time, more time than football can afford. The crisis is here and now. Small wonder that FIFA’s major sponsors such as Sony, adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola have grown increasingly concerned at the danger of tainting their brands by association with this shameless crew. Small wonder, too, that the people of Brazil should be seriously concerned about their government’s collaboration with such a brazen bunch.

Over the past few days, these  people have shown themselves to be the most gracefully impressive of hosts. And they take justified pride in the fact that their country has given the game many of its greatest players and most of its greatest occasions. But the price of success has risen beyond reason and, in a land where reality can be cruelly unrewarding, they are questioning the prevailing priorities.

It is all a far cry from Bellini and his men of ’58, when Pele began his golden journey and Brazilian football carried the promise of glory — and the price of the World Cup was not plundered from the pockets of the poor.

News reaches South America that an old friend of this column is singing a familiar song. You may recall that Ashley Giles, as the acting England cricket coach, was once favoured to land the permanent job.

A wretched run of results, a disastrous World Twenty20 tournament and defeat by the Netherlands scuppered his dreams. Giles accepted his fate but, inevitably, Kevin Pietersen detected a plot.

‘Sadly, I think he was just too close to me for the England and Wales Cricket Board’s liking,’ he said. Yet again, it was all about KP. In his world, it’s always about KP. And still he wonders why we decline to take him seriously.
