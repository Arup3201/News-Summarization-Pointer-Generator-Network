From the Kennedy clan to Henrietta Tiarks, the future Duchess of Bedford, 1950s photographer Mark Shaw was the man behind some of the most iconic images of the era.

But, as new book, Dior Glamour: 1952–1962, reveals, not everything Shaw photographed had celebrity at its heart.

The lavish volume documents the post-war heyday of French fashion house and includes rare images of Christian Dior himself, working behind the scenes.

Other photographs, among them some of the earliest fashion images shot in colour, show models, socialites, and actresses posing in Dior’s romantic full-skirted New Look day-dresses, impeccably cut suits and romantic ball gowns.

Most of the 140 photographs in the book are previously unseen and were discovered languishing in a hidden vault in the Mark Shaw Photographic Archive, which was set up after his death in 1969.

Sometimes referred to as the Kennedy's unofficial family photographer, Shaw made his name photographing the 1950s jet-setting elite.

Among his subjects are some of the era's most famous names, including Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Pablo Picasso, Yves Saint Laurent and Elizabeth Taylor.

Most of the images ended up in LIFE magazine, where Shaw worked for more than a decade, during which time he racked up an impressive 27 covers.

Other clients included Harper's Bazaar, the magazine where he started his career in 1946, and the Paramount film studios.

Although the new book focuses on Shaw's less well known fashion work, there's still a sprinkling of stardust courtesy of iconic Christian Dior model and muse, Kouka.

Dior Glamour: 1952 - 1962, photographed by Mark Shaw with a preface by Lee Radziwill and an introduction by Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni, £70, is released next month by Rizzoli New York
