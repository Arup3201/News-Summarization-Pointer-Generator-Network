David Moyes fuelled the debate on his dismal Manchester United season on Friday by insisting even Sir Alex Ferguson could not have done better.

The under-fire manager made the amazing claim on the same day Jose Mourinho said Fergie could not be held responsible for what has gone on since he retired.

Moyes will face another ordeal at the hands of angry fans if his side fail to beat Aston Villa on Saturday and there are plans for a plane to fly over Old Trafford before the game with a banner calling for him to be axed. But the defiant boss insisted that only makes him more determined to succeed.

Moyes said: ‘If Sir Alex were here this year it would be difficult for him as well and I’m sure he’d agree.

‘People are aware there’s a squad that is ageing, so it would have been a tough season for whoever was in charge of United this year. It could have been the case no matter what.’

Some fans turned on Ferguson after the Manchester derby defeat at Old Trafford on Tuesday over his part in appointing Moyes.

But that prompted Mourinho, a close friend of Fergie, to speak out in his defence.

The Chelsea manager said: ‘He made United what United is. He deserves to retire and enjoy life. ‘Now he’s responsible for what? For what? United lose a match and it’s his responsibility?

Mutual respect: Mourinho, right, and Ferguson are close friends

'United struggle in the Premier League and it’s his problem? (Wayne) Rooney misses a goal, or (David) De Gea makes a mistake and it’s his fault? Let him retire in peace.’

Moyes, who has presided over seven home defeats this season, insisted Ferguson’s faith and support are key factors in why he will survive the crisis.

He said: ‘The people who appointed me are incredibly knowledgeable football people — in fact, it was probably the most knowledgeable person who gave me the job.

‘They saw somebody who could do the job at Manchester United and know what the club is about and the style of the job so you have to trust those people. They trust me and for that reason we’ll go on working together.

‘I have continued with the philosophy and style that I believe I work in and that I believe Manchester United work in. I came here with a long-term job, not a short-term one.’

Stewards had to guard Moyes’ ‘Chosen One’ banner in the Stretford End on Tuesday night amid fears it could be torn down, and unhappy fans have paid for a plane to fly over Old Trafford on Saturday with the message ‘Wrong One — Moyes Out’ in red lettering.

The Scot said: ‘It’s something people are entitled to do. But that’s not what I’ve sensed.

‘I sense a stronger level of support in Old Trafford — for their club, for their team. If anything, I would say United supporters this year have been as good as people have seen them for many a year.

‘It’s a long journey here and this is just the start of the journey. You work hard to get to this place and I’m probably even more driven now because we’re in a position where it’s easy for people to say it can’t be done. Well, that’s the job that we’re going to do.’

Asked if the ‘Chosen One’ banner has become a hindrance, Moyes replied: ‘It makes no difference to me. I’ve said from day one here that until I’m successful I’ve got no need for any banners.

‘I’ll be happy when I’ve won trophies and then I can have a banner up there rightly.’
