The 'friendly' match between Boca Juniors and Racing Club during Argentina's off-season proved to be anything but. 

Boca right-back Leandro Marin scythed down Racing midfielder Ricardo Centurion with a violent two-footed lunge. 

The ensuring red card was Boca's second of the game after just 30 minutes and they went on to lose 4-1.

Centurion is suspected to have suffered a broken leg as a result of the challenge. 

Argentina's football season is set to kick off in mid-February with Racing, who went unbeaten in their final nine games of the previous campaign, the reigning champions of the Primera Division, the country's top domestic league.

Boca, meanwhile, finished last season fifth in the table, with just two wins from their final six fixtures.

It is unclear at the moment whether any action will be taken against Marin for his tackle.
