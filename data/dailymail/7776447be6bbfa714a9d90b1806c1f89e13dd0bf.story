An obese 12-year-old with diabetes has lost 6lbs and is off insulin thanks to drastic weight loss surgery paid for in part through an online crowd-funding campaign.

Alexis Shapiro was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and the treatment left her with a conditon called hypothalamic obesity - basically she gained 151lbs in less than two years.

After their insurance initially rejected bariatric surgery for the girl, her mother, Jenny Shapiro, reached out to donors on Gofundme.com, and managed to rise more than $86,000 to cover medical expenses.

The Cibolo, Texas tween went under the knife March 21, and her mom says she's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery.

'Her diabetes is pretty much gone,' Mrs Shapiro told People. 'She is off insulin.'

The thrilled parent said her daughter's mood has also improved.

'She looks healthier and has more energy,' she said. 'The other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs.'

Doctors hope the 4'7" school girl will lose as much as 50lbs thanks to the surgery, which reduced the size of her stomach to a quarter of its original size.

According to People, Alexis was booked in for a gastric bypass at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center but due to complications they changed tack and proceeded with sleeve gastrectomy surgery.

The 12-year-old still can't have solid foods and gets full very easily, but she is on the road to recovery.

'Of course she wants to be healed and done with everything,' Mrs Shapiro said, 'but each day gets better.'

The mom is posting updates on Alexis' shrinking size on Facebook.

Alexis' long-awaited gastric bypass last month had to be scrapped because of her enlarged liver.  

Staff at the Cincinnati hospital shared on Twitter that the surgeons could not proceed with the gastric bypass because the 203lbs 12-year-old's liver turned out to be bigger than they had anticipated, and the operation was no longer the safest option for the girl.

Felling better: 'She looks healthier and has more energy,' her mom said. 'The other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs'

As
 an alternative, the medical team decided to proceed with what they 
called a staged approach, opting for a sleeve gastrecomy: a weigh-loss 
procedure where the stomach is permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its
 original size.

Dr Thomas Inge, who headed the team of surgeons in the operating room, explained that they were unable to proceed as planned because Alexis' liver was too stiff and immovable for them to clearly see inside the stomach.

Inge said a senior surgeon went out to the waiting area and broke the news to Jenny and Ian Shapiro, Alexis' parents, telling them that they will have to go ahead with a back-up plan.

'They were not disappointed,' the doctor recalled. 'I think they were surprised that we had to go with plan B.'

The surgeons were able to nudge Alexis' oversize liver just enough to expose the left side of the stomach and cut away about 80 per cent of it, leaving a narrow 'sleeve' roughly the shape and size of a banana.

'We were very pleased with the outcome of the operation,' Inge said. 'So it was not disappointing at all.'

While the hospital had announced on social media earlier in the day that the gastric bypass will take place at a later time, this afternoon Dr Inge said that the jury is still out on whether or not the surgery will go forward - it will all depend on Alexis' progress. 

He explained that while sleeve gastrectomy is considered to be an effective and increasingly popular weight-loss option, Alexis may not be able to lose as much weight as with a bypass.

If the 12-year-old does manage to shed enough pounds in the first year to 18 months to significantly reduce the size of her fatty liver, her doctors will evaluate her again and weigh all the pros and cons of a second surgery.

The operation would entail converting the gastrectomy into a bypass by connecting Alexis' small intestine to her stomach 'sleeve.'  

'I think she will have a new normal,' the surgeon said, responding to a question about Alexis' future.

The 12-year-old's father, Ian Shapiro, described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family.  

According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise.

If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs.

The weight-loss surgery, which diminishes the size of the stomach and shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite, will help the girl feel more sated with less food.

But the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks, chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity.

Dr Inge estimates that his young 
patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - 
in the first year after the surgery.

Alexis'
 parents, who also have two younger daughters, say they do not consider 
the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter's 
health problems at once.

Miracle worker: Doctor Thomas Inge, from Children's Hospital Medical Center, led the team of surgeons who operated on Alexis

Mrs
 Shapiro says she simply wants her 12-year-old to be able to ride a bike
 like other kids, go swimming with her siblings and walk around without 
drawing stares from strangers.

The
 family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well-wishers 
from around the world, who have donated more than $86,000 toward Alexis'
 medical care, travel costs and living expenses through the Shapiros' 
online fundraising campaign.

Whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children, Jenny Shapiro said earlier this year.

Alexis' life-threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor called craniopharnygioma.  

During the operation, her hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged.

She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions.

After her brain surgery, Alexis' parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death.

'She's always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we've had to padlock the cupboard.'

In
 just the past four months, Alexis was hospitalized for a kidney 
infection and developed Type 2 diabetes that requires nightly insulin 
injections.

More than half of children with the specific form of tumor Alexis had experience similar post-operative symptoms.

Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 2XL
 and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psychologists about 
how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to 
die.'

After TRICARE, a 
military health insurance, rejected the family's initial request for 
coverage, citing a lack of detail in the application about Alexis' 
condition, the young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would 
take longer than she had.

'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That's what I'm scared of.'

The
 outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page 
gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her
 shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends.

'I hope this will be the beginning of the end of all of her 
pain and insecurities,' Jenny Shapiro wrote in a blog post. 'I hope she won't have to endure another day 
feeling like she is starving. I hope she will be able to think about fun
 things, not just when she will get to eat next.'
