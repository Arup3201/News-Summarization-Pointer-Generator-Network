When Nick Robinson bought a holiday home in the countryside two years ago, he did it to escape the hustle and bustle of life in Westminster.

But the BBC political editor has been ruffling feathers near his Suffolk cottage after complaining about a commotion of a rural kind.

Robinson, 49, was so angry at a cockerel crowing outside his home early in the morning he took to Twitter to say he was ‘contemplating murder’ and joked about eating the bird.

Cry of frustration: Robinson bought the home in Orford, Suffolk, to escape the hustle and bustle of Westminster

The rooster’s owner was less than impressed that the city-dweller was moaning about the farming lifestyle that first persuaded him to buy a cottage there.

And after a local paper reported his gripes, Robinson has been forced to backtrack, defending his comment as a ‘one-off cry of frustration’.

The town-country clash began last week when the BBC journalist was at his property on the coast.

On Thursday morning he tweeted to his 180,000 followers: ‘Awoke contemplating murder – the Suffolk countryside isn’t big enough for me and the b****y cockerel who sat outside my window at 5am.’

Shortly  after, he apparently endorsed the comment of BBC colleague Daniel Sandford, who wrote: ‘That’s not murder. That’s lunch.’ Robinson re-tweeted those words, saying: ‘Interesting thought.’

He later retweeted a suggestion that he should make the bird into a haggis, writing: ‘Good tip.’

As a local paper in East Anglia got wind of the story he tweeted to one of its journalists: ‘Glad you tracked down the fowl bird. Sorry you missed me! Did you photograph them or prepare them for the pot?! #onlyjoking.’ 

The bird’s owner, Nick Egerton – himself a former Londoner who moved to Suffolk 30 years ago – said crowing was simply what roosters did, adding: ‘That’s all part of country life … they’re just part of the scenery.’

Robinson said last night: ‘I have never and would never dream of complaining about what makes the countryside such an escape – the sights and sounds are natural and not man-made. My tweet was a one-off cry of frustration – a sort of anti-cockerel troll if you like – from a grumpy middle-aged man who had not had enough sleep.

‘I would no more want to have the cock-a-doodle-doos silenced than to pave over the fields or fill in the estuary.’

Robinson usually lives in Highbury, North London, with his wife Pippa and their three children.

After buying the cottage he said he loved the village because it was ‘just very chilled, people are incredibly friendly and laid-back’.
