Steaua Bucharest were simply referred to as 'hosts' during Sunday's Romanian league clash against CSMS Iasi after losing a legal battle  over their trademark.

Deprived of their name, colours and badge on a surreal night of football, the Romanian champions scored in the fifth minute of injury time to beat their opponents 1-0.

Romania's most famous club, who were founded in 1947 as an army side, had their registration cancelled by the country's highest court on Wednesday after losing a battle with the ministry of defence.

Steaua Bucharest (playing in yellow against Aalborg last month) have been banned from officially using the name after losing legal battle

The club aren't allowed to wear their traditional red and blue colours, ruled Romania's highest court 

The club's badge was also covered up

The ministry had first resorted to law in 2011, saying the club had used the Steaua brand illegally since 2004.

The court verdict effectively left the most popular and successful club in Romanian football as a team without a name and no identity.

The 1986 European champions, playing in yellow instead of their famous red and blue shirts, were presented on Sunday by the stadium's announcer as 'the champions of Romania'.

They appeared as 'hosts' on the scoreboard and the club's emblem was replaced by an empty square. Steaua was never mentioned.

The name effectively became invisible, removed from all training kits and officials' suits. The teams' two names were missing from the teamsheet, which were presented to reporters before the clash. 

The club have since reached agreement with the country's defence ministry to be allowed to use the club's name, colours and badge in their Europa League match against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday.

Steaua said in a statement that the agreement followed a meeting between Steaua president Valeriu Argaseala and ministry representatives on Monday.

The club's flamboyant owner Gigi Becali and general manager Mihai Stoica are currently serving prison terms for abuse of power.

On the field, Poland centre back Lukasz Szukala scored the winning goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time with both teams reduced to 10 men after CSMS Iasi's Branko Grahovac and Steaua's Andrei Prepelita were sent off in the closing stages.

Steaua, who have won their last five league matches without conceding a goal, top the standings with 43 points from 17 matches, followed by CFR Cluj on 33.

Steaua were in Chelsea's Champions League group last season and were beaten by Jose Mourinho's side twice (0-4 and 1-0).

The season before that the Romanian side came up against the Blues in the quarter-final of the Europa League and beat Chelsea 1-0 in Romania, but were defeated 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.

In 2010-11 Steaua were drawn in a Champions League group with Liverpool and managed a draw in Romania but were defeat 4-1 at Anfield.

Going back to 2005-06 Steaua were beaten in the semi-final of the UEFA Cup by Middlesbrough before the north-east club lost in the final to Sevilla.
