Ah, the glorious hint of summer, the softness of the breeze, the winter grump giving way to lightness, but — ugh — the clothes!

Few things can dull the mood of a (slightly) older lady like a sweep around the shops as autumn/winter’s woollens give way to pastel atrocities and, horror of horror, sleeveless shifts.

At 54, my arms pay no heed to twice-weekly Pilates classes or 40 lengths of the pool. So stubborn are those pockets of fat that the number of surgical ‘arm lifts’  carried out in Britain increased by 97 per cent from 2009 to 2011.But I prefer to rely on the perfect summer sleeve, revealing just the right amount of skin.

At last, the High Street is taking notice, and there are more spring dresses with sleeves than ever. I checked out what’s available . . .

Denim shirt dress, £30, next.co.uk, Heels, £29, dorothyperkins.com

My
 initial reaction to this was ‘Prisoner Cell Block H’. I do wear denim 
quite a bit but this looked a lot younger than what I would usually 
attempt. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised that with a few 
tweaks — rolling up the long sleeves and tying the belt tightly around 
my waist — and a nude pair of heels, it actually looked nice. Not an 
outfit for an expensive lunch, perhaps, but nice for a potter around the
 shops or a picnic. Bright pumps are a must, though.

SCORE: 3/5

LK Bennett lace sleeve dress, £295, johnlewis.com. Heels, £195, lucychoilondon.com

This
 flattering soft pink made my skin look tanned and felt really modern 
and fresh. The delicate, elbow-length lace gave a tantalising glimpse of
 flesh without being too revealing and made my arms appear slimmer. The 
dress skimmed over my hips and was comfortable both sitting and 
standing. I intend to wear this again as it’s sexy without being 
overdone and incredibly comfortable to wear. 

SCORE: 5/5

Floral print dress, £95, Coast-stores.com, Heels, £198, lucychoilondon.com

I am really not a  floral person — I don’t have a single floral item in my wardrobe — but this I really loved.

It’s
 perfectly cut, managing to simultaneously fit like a glove while also 
having plenty of give, so you don’t feel like you’re sewn in. The 
elbow-length sleeves make my arms looks slim and trim. In fact, I like 
it so much I’m going to wear it to a swanky lunch party. Love it. 

SCORE: 4/5

Phase Eight maxi, £120, johnlewis.com, Heels, £60, office.co.uk

A
 lovely evening look with three-quarter-length lace sleeves which were 
neither heavy nor scratchy. Although very fitted, the gentle gathering 
across the stomach cut a flattering shape, and navy was a nice change 
from funereal black. Lace sleeves are the perfect answer to summer 
dressing, especially for over-50s. Very nice.     SCORE: 3.5/5

EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT

Goat belted dress, £450, Fenwick: 0207 629 9161, Heels, £195, lucychoillondon.com

I
 loved the pleating around the bust, while the belt nipped in at  just 
the right point. The sleeves were a lovely length and the hem  was cut 
for an elegant  silhouette. I wouldn’t usually go for white in a dress 
as it can be very unflattering, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it
 is expensive but it looks — and feels — it too. Would look even better 
with a light tan at a  garden party.               

SCORE: 4/5

Embellished midi dress, £399, tedbaker.com, Heels, £69, dune.co.uk

Oh gosh. Not my cup of tea at all. The length made me feel dumpy and, as it was difficult to walk in, I felt incredibly inelegant. The sleeves were cut at an unflattering length and were too unfitted, while the chainmail overlay was far too heavy. Even bare arms would be better. I don’t see myself wearing this any time soon and certainly not at that cost.                       

SCORE:0/5
