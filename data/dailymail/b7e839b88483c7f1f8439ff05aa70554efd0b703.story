The Seattle Seahawks may have defeated the Denver Broncos in this year's Super Bowl, but when it comes to football in America, it seems that it is the Dallas Cowboys that truly reign supreme.

This according to the 2014 NFL American fandom map, just released by Facebook, which shows every American county’s favorite professional football team, as determined by the NFL team that Facebook users have ‘liked’ the most.

And like all athletic events, this one has a big loser too, with the New York Jets failing to be the most popular team in any county in the country.

Fans: A new map shows the most popular NFL team by county according to Facebook 

Winners: The Dallas Cowboys are the most popular team in the country according to Facebook

Most of the map is no surprise at all though, with the New England Patriots locking up almost every county from Connecticut through Maine; the New Orleans Saints claiming the top spot throughout Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama; and the Broncos controlling a large portion of middle America.

It is the Cowboys, however, who are by far the biggest team in the country, with large chunks of fans not only in Texas, but also Nevada, Virginia, Oregon, and Idaho.

The San Francisco 49ers have a pretty strong reach too, as the most popular team in Hawaii, as well as northern California.  

No love: The New York Jets failed to claim a majority of fans in any county in the country

Second rate: More people in Pennsylvania are fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers rather than the Philadelphia Eagles

On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Philadelphia Eagles did not manage to get much love at all, with almost every county in their home state backing the Pittsburgh Steelers.

But even the Eagles managed to lock up southeastern Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey, whereas the Jets got trounced in New York by Giants fans.

In fact, of the 32 professional teams in the NFL, they are the only one who did not manage to secure at least one county. 

Seems like that Giants-Jets rivalry may be a little bit more one-sided than some would like to admit.
