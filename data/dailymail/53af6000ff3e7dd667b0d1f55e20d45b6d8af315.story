It might not look friendly, but a tiny ancient crab-like creature cared for its young 450 million years ago, a newly discovered fossil reveals.

The 'nursery in the sea' has revealed a new species with specimens preserved incubating their eggs together with probable hatched creatures huddled close to their bodies.

The team of international scientists has named the new species Luprisca incuba after Lucina, goddess of childbirth.

The team of international scientists has named the new species Luprisca incuba (pictured) after Lucina, goddess of childbirth, because the ancient crab-like creature incubated her eggs, which are distinguishable as the circular shapes beneath her fossilised body at the bottom of this image

The name also alludes to the fact that the fossils are ancient and in each case the mother was literally sitting on her eggs.

The new species is a type of fossilised ostracod, which is part of an animal group related to shrimps, lobsters and crabs was discovered in mudstone rocks from New York State, dating back to the Ordovician period of geological time.

Ostracods are tiny crustaceans and are related to thousands of species living in oceans, rivers, lakes and ponds today as well as from countless fossil shells.

The nurturing Luprisca incuba is the oldest confirmed occurrence of ostracods in the fossil record, according to the study in the journal Current Biology.

Professor David Siveter, Emeritus Professor of Palaeontology at the University of Leicester who led the team of scientists, said: ‘This a very rare and exciting find from the fossil record.

Only a handful of examples are known where eggs are fossilised and associated with the parent. The find tells scientists that the ancient tiny marine crustaceans took particular care of their brood (in yellow) in exactly the same way as their living relatives

‘Only a handful of examples are known where eggs are fossilised and associated with the parent.

‘This discovery tells us that these ancient tiny marine crustaceans took particular care of their brood in exactly the same way as their living relatives.’

The newly discovered fossils are two to three millimetres long and are especially informative because they are exceptionally well preserved, complete with not only the shell but also the soft parts of the animal that in all but very rare cases are lost to the fossil record.

Limbs and in some specimens a clutch of eggs are present within the shell, enabling the scientists to identify the gender of some of the ancient creatures.

Their anatomical features were preserved in the mineral pyrite and the scientists used x-ray techniques to reveal morphological details hidden within the shells and the rock.

The ostracods lived together with other invertebrate animals such as trilobites, in poorly oxygenated conditions in a sea bordering the margins of the ancient North American continent.

Professor David Siveter said that like their modern relatives, the ostracods were probably capable of swimming near the sea bed and obtained their food by scavenging and hunting.
