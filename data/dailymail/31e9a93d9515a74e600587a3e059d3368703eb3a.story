The Arkansas teen impaled through the jaw by a deer's antler during a horrific car crash has recalled the moment she first looked at her reflection  moments after the accident.

'You look in that mirror and see your teeth aren't where they used to be. Your face is bleeding really bad, and you realize this isn't a time where I can just call mom,' said 17-year-old high school senior Tori Henry about the October smash.

Rushed to hospital, Henry underwent five hours of emergency surgery to wire her face and repair the damage left after the deer came through the windscreen on the drivers side as it bolted through traffic.

Recovery: Tori Henry is now back at home after her collision with the deer in October and has only a small scar on her left hand side to show for the near-fatal crash

Support: Tori with her mother Nikki Winn who says that her daughter has learned to appreciate life more following the accident 

Now, two months later and multiple operations, Tori has been left with only a small scar.

'At first, you know, I was really scared because I wouldn't see Tori anymore,' said the teen to KFVS.12.

Due to the stellar work of surgeons at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Jonesboro, Tori had two metal plates put into her jaw.

Back home now and able to reflect on her brush with death, Tori told KFVS that she would not change a thing about that moment or that day.

'Every little detail of the accident is what it needed to be for me to be sitting right here, right now,' said Tori.

'I would not take this accident back. It opens your eyes so much to the reality of life isn't a guarantee.'

Tori's mother, Nikki Winn said that she believes her daughters positive attitude was responsible for her full recovery.

'I only allowed progress,' said Tori. 'Nothing else was allowed. Recovery was all that I was going to do.'

Nikki said that now the most important thing for her daughter is to return to her schooling and routine.

Recovering: Tori, right ahead of Homecoming just a week before the incident, managed to stay calm despite the terrifying ordeal and pulled her car over. She was later airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery

'We are just trying to be normal again,' said Winn to KFVS. 'If we can inspire people along the way and make a difference in someone's life then that's great.'

Tori said that if anyone was to see her as an inspiration then she would be happy, albeit reluctantly.

'Me just talking to them and then hearing my story and seeing how quickly I recovered, if that could just make them feel better about themselves then it would be a dream come true to me,' said Tori.

And in the aftermath of the accident, Tori now has decided to consider a career in medicine, so impressed and grateful was she for the care given to her by the doctors and nurses.

In October, the teenager was driving on one of the city's busiest streets when the five-point buck tried to jump over her car - but smashed into the driver's window and impaled her face with its antler.

Despite the terrifying experience, Tori stayed surprisingly calm, her mother told KAIT.

'She kept her composure after the deer hit her and drove and parked her car so no one else would get hurt,' her proud mom, Nikki Winn, said.

As she recovered, Tori posted pictures of her sporting a swollen cheek, but they were a far cry from the week before the accident, when she was voted to be part of Homecoming court at Paragould High School.
