A new study has shown a link between Twitter usage and the number of relationships plagued by social media-related fights.

More than 500 active Twitter users were surveyed and the results showed that the more time an individual spent on the social networking site, the more problems ensued in their relationships.

'Although a number of variables can contribute to relationship infidelity and separation, social networking site usage, such as Twitter and Facebook use, can be damaging to relationships,' the report's author Russell Clayton said.

Watching over: A new study showed a connection between the amount that someone is active on Twitter and the likelihood that they will have a social networking-related conflict in their romantic offline relationships

Findings: Russell Clayton, pictured, is a doctoral student at the University of Missouri and previously examined the detrimental effects of Facebook

Mr Clayton, a doctoral student at the 
University of Missouri School of Journalism, previously studied the 
effect that Facebook had on relationships and now his examination into 
Twitter proves that the newer micro-blogging platform is creating a 
similar level of jealousy that he found for Facebook.

'Facebook-induced jealousy, partner surveillance, posting ambiguous information, compulsive Internet use, and online portrayal of intimate relationships can be damaging to romantic relationships,' he wrote in the study, released Sunday.

'Since Twitter now allows users to interact in a similar way as Facebook (i.e., write posts and upload images, videos, and location check-ins), the researcher theorizes that the effects of Twitter use on interpersonal relationships are comparable to those associated with Facebook.'

For Facebook, he found that if partners stayed 'friends' on the social network, that would delay the healing process because they would go back and look through their ex's activity and photos.

In the new study, called ‘The Third Wheel’, Mr Clayton went on to extrapolate that, as a result of the interview with 581 Twitter users, reports of Twitter-related conflict within couples 'significantly predicted' negative outcomes that included cheating and break ups.

'I found it interesting that active Twitter users experienced Twitter-related conflict and negative relationship outcomes regardless of length of romantic relationship,' Clayton said.

Perils of Twitter: Though no specific numbers were released of the exact number of divorces were caused by excessive Twitter use, some high profile cases like that of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin make the likelihood of Twitter-related conflicts in marriages seem very likely

'Couples who reported being in relatively new relationships experienced the same amount of conflict as those in longer relationships.'

One solution that they suggest is to limit the individual's time on Twitter if they begin to notice the outbreak of Twitter-related disagreements.

Another option is to take the secrecy out of the equation by having joint accounts that both partners use and have easy access to.
