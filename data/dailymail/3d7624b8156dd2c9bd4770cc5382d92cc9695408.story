A climate change action group has canned a suggested billboard image after critics accused it of comparing coal mining to 'paedophilia'.

The Australian Youth Climate Coalition (AYCC) is hosting a billboard competition on its Facebook page for a sign to be displayed at Brisbane Airport when G20 leaders arrive next month.

One proposed billboard featured the slogan, 'Don't let the coal lobby get their dirty hands on our future' and a picture of a child with large, wrinkly hands covering her mouth.  

Backlash: This AYCC billboard was the target of criticism

The AYCC proposed several billboard designs, but were forced to remove one after a social media backlash

The AYCC took the competition entry down after a wave of negative comments.

'This is sick!' said one Twitter user. '(It's) comparing paedophilia with hardworking coal mining Australians.'

In a statement on its Facebook page, the AYCC said: 'We have removed an entry from the competition after concerns were raised about the content.'

Liberal backbencher George Christensen blasted the proposed image on Twitter, describing the AYCC as 'environutbags'.

Hello, Barack: This is another suggested billboard which could be aimed at G20 leaders when they arrive in Brisbane next month

'Our future is at stake': Another potential billboard which the AYCC proposed could be posted at Brisbane International Airport

Another user described the controversy as 'faux outrage'. 

Several suggested AYCC billboard designs urged the G20 to put climate change on the agenda of next month's meeting. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has consistently said climate change would be a more appropriate topic at separate international forums.

U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin are among the leaders expected to visit Brisbane.
