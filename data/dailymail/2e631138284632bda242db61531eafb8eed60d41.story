A Delaware couple was arrested for getting too spicy on the roof of a Chipotle Mexican Grill.

Michael Suh, 38, and Nicole Germack, 27, both of Newark, Delaware, were caught by police having sex on the roof of the restaurant while it was still open, authorities said.

The pair’s encounter took place at 9.40 p.m., according to a police press release. The burrito joint closes at 10.00 p.m., people were still inside eating.

Police told the station they were called by several people who saw the randy couple ‘engaging in sexual intercourse’ on the roof.

Witnesses complained the amorous couple could be seen going at it from the street, and an arriving officer reported seeing them at the ‘very front’ of the building.

The officer repeatedly asked them to stop, but they continued satisfying their hunger for each other for another 15-20 seconds before finishing, police said.

Suh and Germack both ran across the roof into his apartment next door when told by the officer they were under arrest.

The officer soon located the pair inside Suh’s apartment and arrested them without incident.

Each defendant faces charges of resisting arrest, second-degree indecent exposure and third-degree conspiracy.

Both were released after posting a $1,800 bond, authorities said.

A Newark Police Department spokesperson reached by MailOnline declined to say whether alcohol or drugs played a factor, adding that the encounter was consensual and they were both adults.
