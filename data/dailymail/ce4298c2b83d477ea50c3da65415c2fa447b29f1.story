Dog owners have healthier hearts than people who don’t have pets, research suggests.

And those who already have cardiac problems may be more likely to survive if they have the companionship of a pet.

The American Heart Association reviewed studies from around the world and concluded pet ownership, particularly dog ownership, ‘is probably associated with a decreased risk of heart disease’.

Research suggests dog owners walk far more than other people, which could help descrease the risk of heart disease

The strongest data comes from studies which show that dog owners walk far more than other people.

Research also credits pets with relieving stress and having a beneficial effect on obesity and cholesterol levels. Glenn Levine, who led the study, said there may also be a psychological benefit from simple companionship.

The American Heart Association said the research doesn’t actually prove that the benefits come directly from the pets.

For instance, it may be that healthier people are particularly likely to be animal lovers.

However, the links are strong enough for it to have issued a statement saying that pet ownership and, particularly dog ownership, may be associated with a decreased risk of heart disease.

Dr Levine, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said the benefits may come from a range of physical factors, including exercise and stress relief.

Speaking as he walked his three dogs, he said: ‘A person may take better care of themselves if they have a good bond with a pet and feel better about themselves and are more motivated to live longer.’

He added that pet owners still need to take care of their heart in other ways.

‘The primary reason you should adopt or rescue or buy a pet is to give that pet a loving home and to derive enjoyment from the relationship .

‘We don’t want people to go out and adopt a dog or a cat and then sit on the couch eating potato chips and smoking a cigarette and assume they are now going to live longer.’
