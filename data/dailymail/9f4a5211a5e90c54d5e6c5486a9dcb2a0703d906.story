Dispute: According to claims filed at the High Court, a company owned by Lord Sugar is suing its lawyers for more than £1million

Alan Sugar is suing his own lawyers for allegedly botching a property deal which ended up costing one of his companies more almost £1million, it has emerged.

Amsprop, a property company owned by the Labour peer, has filed a claimed at the High Court asking for at least £1.3million in damages from the solicitors Kingsley Napley.

The documents claim that the company was forced to pay jewellers Longmire £970,500 to give up the lease on their location in New Bond Street, Central London.

Longmire - which specialises in cufflinks - occupied 10 New Bond Street, with Swatch - the watch seller - next door at 10A. But Amsprop wanted to stop Longmire's lease so they could combine the two properties and let them both to Swatch, according to the Evening Standard.

Amsprop, the papers said, launched a claim to deny Longmire a new lease in April 2012. The documents claim Kingsley Napley advised Amsprop to change its plans to maximise their chances in the courts.

However, it is also claimed that the solicitors failed to disclose documents relating to Amsprop's original plans for the redevelopment, and also made a mistake by not delaying the court battle in light of new developments in the case.

The papers go on to explain that a judge found that Longmire was entitled to a new lease, forcing Amsprop to pay them £970,500 in order to give up its right.

'As a consequence of the defendent’s negligence and breaches of duty, Amsprop has suffered loss and damage', the claim says. Amsprop is seeking the full costs of the Longmire settlement as well as another £326,379 in costs and legal fees.

A Kingsley Napley spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are disappointed that this case is being progressed. We deny the claim and will vigorously contest it'.

Amsprop describes the property at the heart of the dispute as: 'An 
												attractive period building constructed in 1877', and boasts of its prime Mayfair location.

As well as the two residential units, the building has office space on the first and second floors, a flat on the third floor and another residential space spanning the fourth and fifth floors.

The average property on New Bond Street is worth around £8.5million, according to property site Zoopla.

Lord Sugar's property empire is a key strut of his wealth, and reportedly made the entrepreneur more money than the computers for which he is famed.

Earlier this year Amsprop sold a large plot of land near Stansted airport in Essex. It made a hefty profit on the land, which it bought for £1.6million in 1998. Part was sold to a farmer in 2013 for £5million, before home developer Bovis took the rest for £7.5million.

Other notable deals include the sale of a block of property in Oxford Street, Central London, for £77million and the IBM building on the South Bank for £120million.

The Sunday Times Rich List recently pinned Lord Sugar's wealth at £900million, £560million of which comes from Amsprop's portfolio, managed by his 42-year-old son Daniel.
