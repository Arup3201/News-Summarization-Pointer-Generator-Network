Russell Brand has certainly not held back since becoming a crusader against global capitalism.

He has called for an ‘orgy’ of banker bashing, urged people to refuse to pay taxes and called profit a ‘filthy word’.

But he appears to have no problem with raising nearly £1million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers and a Premier League footballer to make a documentary about himself.

Investors were enticed with generous tax breaks to support the film, portraying Brand, 39, as a ‘troubled visionary’ seeking to change the world.

The entertainer-turned-campaigner – said to be worth £15million – faced charges of hypocrisy after details of the funding arrangements emerged yesterday. 

His public pronouncements on bankers – whom he wants to be punished for their role in the financial crisis – have been rather more outspoken.

‘I think an orgy of any kind would be great, but one that focuses on banker bashing would be the best kind,’ he told BBC One’s Question Time last year.

He has also declared on Newsnight: ‘David Cameron says profit isn’t a dirty word. Well I say profit is a filthy word.’ These trenchant positions are at odds with his use of venture capital to finance the upcoming film. 

The film funded by investors is a documentary in which Brand calls on fans not to 'comply' with the system

Company documents list Russell Edward Brand as a director of Mayfair Film Partnership Limited since his 'appointment' in July  2010.

Other directors are listed as Brand's manager, Andrew Antonio, the best man at his wedding, Nicholas Linnen and John Linnen.

The company is registered at an accountants firm in Burnham on Sea, Somerset, whose offices are opposite a tattoo parlour and a junk shop in the seaside town.

Investors are believed to include city financial director Una Lodge, Sunderland and former England footballer Wes Brown, and an estimated 17 other shareholders.

Called Brand, it is co-produced by Mayfair Film Partnership, of which he is a director. Shares in the firm worth £973,000 were sold to 21 outside investors, including an executive with bank giant JPMorgan Chase.

The largest stake went to Sunderland defender Wes Brown.

The shares were bought under the Government’s Enterprise Investment Scheme, which provides tax incentives for people to invest in risky new businesses.

One leading accountant, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He’s being a capitalist, but he then goes on Newsnight and rants about how terrible capitalism is. I would challenge his hypocrisy.’

A source said Brand did not benefit from any tax relief because he is not an investor in the company.

The BBC gave Brand many platforms to publicise his book Revolution – but rarely challenged his claims. It took website Buzzfeed to find a professor, Chandran Kukathas of the London School of Economics, to assess his work.  

BRAND ON INTERNATIONAL CAR SALES: ‘I wouldn’t worry too much about exporting them, as other countries have their own f***ing cars.’

PROF KUKATHAS: ‘It’s hard to see how one could come up with a sillier thought. A 30-second search on Wikipedia will tell you fewer than 50 countries make cars.’

ON THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY: ‘If my vacuum cleaner went nuts and forced me to live in economic slavery, I wouldn’t roll my eyes and say “Oh well” and humbly do its bidding. I’d turn it off and f*** it out the window.’

THE PROFESSOR: ‘Is the industry really like a vacuum cleaner? How does one turn it off? Or throw it out the window?

ON DEBT: ‘Cancelling personal debt would stimulate the economy more than any “too big to fail” bank quantitative easing.’

THE PROFESSOR: ‘Mr Brand is quite confused. Quantitative easing is neither necessary nor sufficient for stopping a bank or any other corporation from failing.’

ON CORPORATIONS: ‘If they don’t pay tax, we’ll reclaim their assets and give them to the people who work there to run.’

THE PROFESSOR: ‘What does he mean? Most corporations are owned by shareholders. If you take the assets away from them … you will deprive millions of their income, and perhaps their livelihood.’

ON THE NATION STATE: ‘It may have served its purpose and have to be dissolved – it’s not a big deal.’

THE PROFESSOR: ‘I have no idea what he means here. How is this to be done?’

ON REVOLUTION: ‘The spiritual Revolution, the Revolution we are about to realise, will be fast because the organisms are in place.’

THE PROFESSOR: ‘If the revolution advocated is a spiritual transformation, what is one to make of the authoritarian element of the manifesto? It sounds like the new society is going to have an awful lot of confiscating, and forbidding – stopping people from exporting, or fracking, or building up capital.’

Russell Brand was mocked this weekend after he appeared in a corporate box at a West Ham match.

Rather than sit among fellow fans, the comedian was seen standing among suited businessman behind the glass of a hospitality suite.

Footballer Joey Barton joked about Brand on Twitter, posting: 'Russell Brand. Man of the people. Starting his revolution from the executive boxes. Very Che Guevara.'

Another website user added: 'The cost of one executive box for a day at Upton Park could pay for an NHS nurse for a month. Disgusted.'

Brand was later filmed kissing West Ham manager Sam Allardyce after his team beat league champions Manchester City 2-1.
