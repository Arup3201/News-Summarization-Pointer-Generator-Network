Their faces are etched with deep lines that reveal lives lived in hardship.

Their expressions captured by UK-based artist and photographer Lee Jeffries, who strives to reveal the human face of addiction, the reality of homelessness and the real face of poverty through his work.

Travelling the globe Mr Jeffries, who is a full-time accountant, has sought to capture the faces of those people shunned by society.

His latest project took him to Miami in Florida. There he met Margo Stevens, a former porn star resigned to living on the streets of the Overtown district.

Photographer Lee Jeffries has made it his mission in life to give a human face to poverty, addiction and homelessness. For his latest project he spent two weeks in Miami, where he met former porn star Margo Stevens (pictured)

Ms Stevens (right) was a successful adult film star in the 1990s, living a comfortable life from the money she made, supplement by working as an escort. Today she lives on the streets of the Overtown district of Miami, in an abandoned garage with five other girls, who sell their bodies for sex to feed their drug addictions

In two weeks, Jeffries delved beyond the labels that are so readily used to define Ms Stevens and others. He looked past the 'prostitute', the 'homeless down and out' and instead reveals Ms Stevens to be a mother-figure who reaches out to the younger women around her, offering advice, shelter and a friend to turn to. Pictured is a woman called Trish, who works on the streets using the name 'Snow'

'Her story is stark,' Jeffries told MailOnline. 'She is a beautiful person, whose story is both fascinating and tragic.

'She's been exploited her whole life, but still she remains incredibly human.

'Margo was a well-known porn star in the 1990s, she lived the life back then. But her fall to life now hit me hard.'

Jeffries said he found Ms Stevens sleeping in an abandoned garage, meausring 12ft by 6ft, with five other girls. Most are addicted to heroin, and all live off the money they make as sex workers.

He spent two weeks with Ms Stevens learning about the fate which befell her.

After stripping in clubs in Cleveland for a living as a young woman, she fell into working in the adult film industry becoming an escort.

For years she lived comfortably from the earnings she made. But eventually life dealt her a cruel hand.

Far from being able to distance himself from his art, Jeffries is immersed in it. He admits, the project touched him, leaving him angry at the way the adult film industry exploits women like Ms Stevens.

Through his pictures, Jeffries uncovers stories of survival, women driven to selling their bodies as a means of feeding their addiction struggling through life with nowhere else to turn. Pictured is Brittany

The girls in Overtown survive. Labelled "crack whores" some will use their bodies to get the next $10 fix and are often treated worse than stray dogs by the men there. Jeffries said: 'I don't judge Margo,' he said. 'She is in a spiral for whatever reason, it is not important. She chooses not to help herself and maybe the grip of her addiction is such that she can't. She understands what she is doing, the life she is living. She understands the choices she makes, she just cannot see a way out.'

A devastating spiral of homelessness, drug addiction and prostitution ensued.

'She understands the choices she makes, she just cannot see a way out.

'But she is a human being, she looks out for other people. She is so much more than the drugs and the prostitution, the labels. She cares for the younger girls she stays with, often to the detriment of herself.'

Jeffries hopes his latest series of portraits, of which Ms Stevens has become the focus, will help to raise awareness of people like Ms Stevens, those struggling to face the reality of poverty, addiction and living on the streets. Pictured is Latoria

Of his work, Jeffries said: 'This is a small ripple but it is significant in terms of what one person can do'

Far from being able to distance himself from his art, Jeffries is immersed in it. He admits, the project touched him, leaving him angry at the way the adult film industry exploits women like Ms Stevens.

In an interview filmed by Jeffries, Ms Stevens reveals her starting rate in the industry was $500 and the contracts she signed were such that she made no money off the continued reproduction of her performances.

'A lot of people in the industry are quite slimy,' she said. 'They do a lot of exploiting. There are a lot of things about the adult industry that need to change.'

Addressing the financial exploitation, she adds: 'It makes me feel a fool. I'm responsible for that. I let that happen.'

But when asked by Jeffries if she regrets her path in life, Ms Stevens tells the camera, 'no'.

'Not at all,' she said. It is a brave and honest answer, one which garners Jeffries' respect and admiration.
