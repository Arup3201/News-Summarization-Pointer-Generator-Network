Eurostar has started taking bookings for its  new destinations in the south of France - Lyon, Avignon and Marseille - with fares as low as £89 for a standard return.

Travellers can look forward to a seamless journey from the heart of London or Ashford to the centre of Lyon, the French capital of gastronomy, in just over four and a half hours, to Avignon in under six hours, or the bright lights of Marseille in just over six hours.

Eurostar celebrated the opening of ticket sales for its new year-round service  by converting one of its carriages into a Provencal lavender field at St Pancras Station.

The London to Marseille 'best journey time' will be six hours and 27 minutes, says Eurostar

The newly launched Eurostar e320 train will run to Lyon, Marseille and Avignon, with fares starting at £89

The Channel Tunnel high-speed train company will begin the new services on May 1, 2015, with returns to Marseille and Avignon starting at £99.

Passengers travelling from southern France back to the UK can board their train without the need to arrive 30 minutes before departure. 

But they will have to go through check-in, security and immigration checks at Lille in northern France, where they will have to leave the train before continuing their journey. 

Lille has recently reopened following extension and refurbishment in preparation for welcoming passengers from Lyon and the South of France.

'Longstanding love affair': Eurostar will offer trains to the South of France from May next year

The London to Lyon best journey time will be four hours and 41 minutes, with Avignon at five hours and 49 minutes, and Marseille at six hours and 27 minutes.

Eurostar commercial director Nick Mercer said: 'Brits have a long-standing love affair with the south of France, and our new service brings the gastronomy, culture and art from the region closer to the UK.

'Eurostar provides an effortless and seamless journey all year round whether it’s for a gastronomic weekend in Lyon, or to soak up Marseille’s sunshine.'

With the new route comes some new partnerships for Eurostar’s 'two for one' offer for entry to temporary exhibitions and permanent collections.

Entry to the MuCEM in Marseille, a national museum dedicated to Mediterranean cultures, and the Musée des Confluences in Lyon (opening December 20), a science centre and anthropology museum, are both part of this offer.
