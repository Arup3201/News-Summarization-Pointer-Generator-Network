A U.S. sailor from Washington State has been put in an almost impossible situation after being asked to appear in court as part of a custody battle to keep his six-year-old daughter, despite being thousands of miles away under the sea.

Navy submariner Matthew Hindes is serving on a submarine in the Pacific Ocean, yet he has been ordered to appear in a Michigan courtroom on Monday - or a warrant for his arrest will be issued.

Hindes is in a custody battle with his ex-wife Angela involving their daughter, Kaylee.

Although he was given permanent custody of Kaylee in 2010, she was removed from his ex-wife's home by child protective services and went to live with her step-mother on the other side of the country.

Daddy's little girl: A judge has ordered Matthew Hindes to appear in court or face contempt, despite the fact that he's out at sea and there's a federal law meant to help those who are deployed.

Me and my dad: Hindes lawyers argue he should be protected by the Service members Civil Relief Act, which states courts in custody cases may grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days to defendants serving their country

Step-mom:  Kaylee has been living with Hindes wife Benita-Lynn her step-mother in Washington state while Hindes is deployed aboard a nuclear submarine in the Pacific Ocean

Serving his country: Military lawyers are now joining the effort to get a delay in the case.  In the meantime Hindes remains deployed serving his country

Kaylee has been living with Hindes new wife Benita-Lynn in Washington state while her father is deployed aboard a nuclear submarine in the Pacific Ocean.

Even though there is no way he can physically be present at the custody hearing, a judge has ordered Hindes to appear in court or face contempt.

Hindes’ lawyers argue he should be protected by the Service members Civil Relief Act, which states courts in custody cases may 'grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days' to defendants serving their country.

The judge hearing the case, circuit court judge Margaret Noe, disagreed, adding, 'If the child is not in the care and custody of the father, the child should be in the care and custody of the mother.'

Noe denied the motion for a stay, ruling that he could have arranged for his wife to bring the child to her mother.

'At this point, I don’t think I have any alternative but to enter a bench warrant for his arrest,' Noe said.

'If the child is not in the care and custody of the father, the child should be in the care and custody of the mother,' Noe said.

Where will she go? Sailor Hindes was given permanent custody of Kaylee in 2010, after she was reportedly removed from his ex-wife's Angela's home by child protective services

Benita-Lynn Hindes had secured money to pay for a flight to Michigan to hand Kaylee over to her mother but does not have the money needed for a rental car

Deployed dad: The sailor is not allowed to appear by Skype or phone, and in custody cases, being absent in court could have a huge effect on the outcome

Plan: Benita-Lynn (right) says they have no choice. She's going to fly back to Michigan with Kaylee to be in court Monday with the possibility the ex-wife will get temporary custody and the sailor won't be there to say goodbye

She has a point: He's protecting the rights of others, but who's protecting his rights? Benita-Lynn said

Sailor Hindes is not even allowed to appear by Skype or phone. There is even a suggestion that his being absent in court could effect on the outcome.

Hindes is not only facing the possibility of losing custody of his daughter, but also the chance to say goodbye, Benita-Lynn Caoile Hindes said to ABC News.

'I’m just trying my best to keep everything together,' she said. 'It’s just hard.'

Benita-Lynn says they have no choice. She's going to fly back to Michigan with Kaylee to be in court Monday with the possibility the ex-wife will get temporary custody and the sailor won't be there to say goodbye

The right choice: It's hoped that the judge in the case will ensure that Kaylee is allowed to live with her stepmother
