Public transport drivers have a dangerous job. Not only do they have to navigate the roads safely everyday but are unprotected from the growing number of attacks just for doing their job.

While some cop sprays of verbal abuse from passengers and other motorists, more bus and taxi drivers are being physically abused, spat on and even stabbed.

The Transport Workers Union and drivers are now calling for greater protection for themselves and the passengers that they are carrying.

Former bus driver Patrick Mcardle told Nine's A Current Affair he has been assaulted three times and spat on countless times.

He says he is now unable to go back to the job after being scarred for life by a road rage incident that got out of hand.

'He slammed me into the window of the drivers side,' he said.

It's believed a grand father was upset after he alleged the bus nearly hit his family car, but took it to the next level by assaulting Mr Mcardle. 

A vicious attack caught on surveillance footage has also seen the moment a bus driver is stabbed in the eye by two men he picked up at a stop.

The culprit is seen stabbing at the driver, demanding he hand over cash, before leaving him distressed and injured.

Meanwhile Bob Richardson has spoken out for taxi drivers, calling for harsher penalties for people who abuse drivers while they are on the job.

He told ACA he copped a belting to the head from a passenger after he was told to stop playing up.

After letting the group out, the passenger continued his reckless behaviour smashing the van's window and tore off the rear vision mirror.

While arrested, the culprit got away with a four month suspended sentence.

Everyday public transport drivers are unprotected from the growing number of attacks just for doing their job

The Transport Workers Union and drivers want to see better protection including a duress alarm, separation of drivers with a perspex divider and live CCTV and GPS tracking

Peter Biagini from the Queensland Transport Workers Union agrees more needs to be done to protect drivers.

'Everyone out in the community will get that message to leave these people alone,' he told ACA.

They want duress alarms, separation of the driver with a perspex divider, and live CCTV and GPS tracking.
