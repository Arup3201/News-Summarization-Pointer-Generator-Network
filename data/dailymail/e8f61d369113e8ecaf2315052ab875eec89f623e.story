An enraged father has made an emotional YouTube video calling out two high schoolers after they made racial slurs about his adopted African American daughter.

Brad Knudson, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, struggled to contain his tears as he recalled how his eighth-grade daughter, whom he and his wife adopted 11 years ago, was targeted by bullies.

And in a shocking twist, when Mr Knudson confronted the father of the bullies, the man responded by calling the concerned dad a 'n***** lover' in messages left on his phone.

The father, Deron Puro, 49, has now been fired from his job. 

Heartbroken: Brad Knudson recorded a six-minute video recalling how his African American daughter was called a 'n*****' by classmates - and when he confronted their father, the man repeated the slur

In shock: He showed the video of the twin boys calling his daughter a 'sl**' and a 'n*****' on Snapchat

In the six-minute video posted to YouTube on Monday, Knudson recalled the incident.

'We have a very beautiful African American daughter that we were very fortunate enough to adopt 11 years ago,' he said.

'We've dealt with a little bit of racism, you know, stares, things like that when she calls us mom or dad, but she didn't notice so we just blew it off because it was directed towards us.'

But on New Year's Eve, his daughter and one of her friends were hanging out at his home and sending Snapchat messages to friends.

A set of twins from her school, who Knudson says do not like his daughter, then started sending her racist, bullying messages on the app, he said.

Loved: He said he would never want his daughter to 'end up committing suicide because of morons'

After Snapchat messages play, they disappear, but when the twins sent their fourth abusive message to the girl, her friend went and told her parents who filmed it on their phone.

Mr Knudson played it to the camera. It shows the twins making faces at the camera and calling the girl a 'sl**', a 'n*****' and a 'fat a** b****'.

The horrified parents found out who the twins were and contacted their parents and even went to their home, but received no answer, he said. 

'I love my daughter and I don't want her to end up committing suicide because of freaking morons,' Knudson said. 'I can't have this hanging over us and my daughter thinking the worst.'

So he contacted police, who went to the school and spoke with the children and their parents.

Mr Knudson then contacted Puro - but received a less than sympathetic response.

'He didn't understand what was wrong with the video,' he recalled.

'He told me I was crazy, that that's what he did when he was a kid. Him and his family make jokes at the house using this word all the time so what was the big deal?'

Puro then left voicemail messages on Mr Knudson's phone, which Knudson played to camera.

'I guess you're a n***** lover,' he said on one.

'That's a correct statement because i am an n***** lover because I have a beautiful African American daughter who I love more than life itself and would do anything for her,' Knudson responded.

Fired: Deron Puro, pictured with his sons, said he stood by his racist comments and did not care if Mr Knudson shared his messages online. Since Mr Knudson shared his name in the video, he has been fired from his job

Puro then sent another: 'Hey Brad, you're a f**, grow up... you're a loser.'

When Knudson told Puro he was going to share the messages on social media, Puro said he stood by his remarks - and that he didn't even care if he gave out his name.

But Puro was probably not expecting the response from viewers of the video, which has been watched more than 300,000 on YouTube.

On Wednesday, it emerged that Puro's employer, financial firm Roy E. Abbott Futures, Inc., where he worked as an independent contractor, let him go, Fox9 reported.

'Deron Puro is no longer associated with Roy E. Abbott Futures, Inc. as of today January 21st,' they wrote in a statement on their website.  

Prior Lake-Savage Area Schools said they are still investigating if this was a situation that was isolated to the one day and incident, or if the bullying has been ongoing.

It is also looking into punishment for the boys but no final decisions have been made.     

'First and foremost, we do not tolerate racism, harassment or bullying of any kind,' Kristi Mussman, director of communications for the district, said in a statement.

'We are conducting our own investigation to get a better understanding of the events that led up to this video. We have reached out to Mr. Knudson directly to offer support for his daughter.

'We strive to maintain safe and respectful schools for all of our students and will continue to work to ensure a safe learning environment for all of our students.'
