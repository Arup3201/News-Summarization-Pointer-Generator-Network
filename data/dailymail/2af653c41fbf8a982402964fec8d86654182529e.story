Lib Dem councillor Eleanor Scott has quit the group in Portsmouth in protest at the party's handling of the Mike Hanock allegations

A senior Lib Dem councillor has quit the party group over its handling of allegations against MP Mike Hancock.

Eleanor Scott resigned from the Lib Dem group on Portsmouth City Council, accusing her party of turning the scandal into a 'game show'.

It comes as the party effectively deselected Mr Hancock, announcing it was looking for a candidate to stand in the 2015 election.

Nick Clegg’s leadership faced a fresh 
crisis last week after revelations that Mr Hancock
 sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent.

Mr Clegg said the first he 
knew about the crisis was when he saw a report by an independent QC into
 the claims.

The party only suspended Mr Hancock last week, three years after allegations against him first surfaced.

Mr Hancock, who denies any wrongdoing,
 resigned the party whip in parliament last year, but was still sitting 
as a Lib Dem local councillor.

After
 a Hampshire police investigation concluded there was no case to answer,
 Portsmouth City Council launched an inquiry into whether Mr Hancock had
 breached the council's code of conduct, but that has now been put on 
hold pending the outcome of the civil court action.

The
 report, carried out by Nigel Pascoe QC for the council, found 
‘compelling’ evidence of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’ 
towards a vulnerable woman constituent.

She suffered a mental health disorder and had been sexually abused as a child.

Now Cllr Scott, who has represented Fratton - the same ward as Mr Hancock - since 2002, has resigned from the Lib Dem group on the council in protest.

She told the Mail: ‘I remain a Liberal Democrat Party member, and committed to being a councillor and Portsmouth.

‘I hope that others involved in the Group’s decision On Friday will reflect on their positions, and do the right thing. We need to run a city, not a game show.'

Cllr
 Scott added: ‘I have previously raised concerns with Liberal Democrat 
Party headquarters in London, and I trust that they will concede that 
they need to give me, and others here, support to clean out the Augean 
Stables.’

Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock, pictured leaving his home in Porchester, Hampshire, is accused of making unwanted advances towards a constituent

Other Lib Dems in Portsmouth have 
continued to voice support for Mr Hancock, accusing the party leadership
 of suspending him without due process.

On Friday Mr Clegg insisted he had taken firm action against Mr Hanock: ‘When I was given the 
specific allegations at the beginning of last year I immediately asked 
our chief whip to investigate. As a result Mike Hancock ceased to be a 
Lib Dem MP.

‘When those 
allegations were then supported by the QC's report that has come to 
light this week again we acted immediately and Mike Hancock has been 
suspended from the Lib Dems altogether.’

However, today it emerged that the woman who has made claims against Mr Hancock wrote to Mr Clegg in March 2011, saying: 'He cannot be trusted and he is a liability to women, public and also your party. Stop the behaviour from him and his staff and whoever is involved with Mr Hancock as this is holy wrong. And please reply to this letter as it is very important to me that I get answers from you.'

A leaked tape recording shows Number 10 staff confirming the letter had been released and it would be passed on to Mr Clegg's political office.

Now the party has moved to effectively de-select Mr Hancock. The local Liberal Democrat group has announced they are in the process of selecting a candidate for the next general election.

Simon Dodd, chairman of Portsmouth Liberal Democrats, has said that although the local party believed Mr Hancock had the right to respond to the allegations against him, they were still considering his future.

He said: 'The Executive has clearly reconfirmed its belief in natural justice and the right of Mike Hancock to fully respond in due course to the allegations made against him. We reiterate our belief that it is for the court to reach its conclusions based on all the evidence.

'The Executive is continuing the process of selecting parliamentary candidates for Portsmouth North and Portsmouth South constituencies to stand at the general election in May 2015 and will be continuing our efforts to contest all wards in the city in the upcoming elections in May 2014.'

But Mr Hancock insisted he would not be forced out by the party.

He told Portsmouth newspaper The News: 'I'll make the decision whether I stand as an MP or not when I decide, not when people are trying to make a decision when they know it will be impossible for me to be involved in it.

'I don't think that it's a very fair thing to do. I'd have thought they at least owed me that to wait for the civil case.'

Meanwhile Mr Clegg continues to face questions about his handling of allegations against Lord Rennard, the former chief executive who denies inappropriate behaviour towards female activists.

Fear: Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party

Friends of the embattled peer have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party.

Lord Rennard - who has denied allegations of sexual harassment - could go ‘nuclear’ if party leader Nick Clegg stops him from re-joining the party.

Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party.

Now friends feel he has been treated ‘cruelly’ and could retaliate if he is shut out permanently.

He could reveal secrets, such as claims like that of a former MP who was known to be a persistent sex pest, the liaison between a Lib Dem peer and married MP, and details of gay affairs between peers and MPs, according to the Sunday Times.

A spokesman for Lord Rennard declined to comment last night.

The Lib Dem peer has kept silent in the last few days, as have the women who made allegations against him.

According to one source, he has a ‘little black book’ filled with many politician and activists’ darkest secrets.

The Lib Dem, who did not wish to be named, said that most of in the party ‘lived in fear’ of the Svengali-like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him.

The source said: ‘He is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off-loaded their skeletons on to him. But he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book. It’s no wonder that it’s taken ten years for anyone to confront him.’ 

Crisis management: Lord Rennard was also at the centre of managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that Mark Oaten (left) had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown (right)

Lord Rennard was also at the centre of 
managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that former MP Mark 
Oaten had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown
 when he was party leader.

He was also chief executive at the time that former party leader Charles Kennedy resigned after his drinking habit was exposed.

Another Lib Dem source revealed: ‘He is the mastermind of many of the dirty tricks campaigns during elections that we have, rightly or wrongly, become known for.

Loyal: Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party

He once suggested printing a 
photograph of an opponent’s house on a leaflet to point out that he did 
not live in the constituency. This was vetoed.’

But
 sources close to party leader Nick Clegg have called it a ‘grubby 
threat’ and warned that ‘it is this sort of thing that got us into this 
mess in the first place...it’s time to move past it.’

An independent mediator is being appointed by the Lib Dems to try and broker a truce between both sides.
