No touchline bust-ups for Uwe Rosler, but he carried the look of a man who wouldn’t need much provoking after this defeat.

Wigan’s night was best summed up when Martyn Waghorn had the freedom of the six-yard box at 1-0 down with 20 minutes remaining. He barely connected with his attempt at a volley.

Rosler looked unimpressed; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer quite relieved. They are good friends so there was no repeat of Rosler’s little tussle with Charlton’s Bob Peeters last weekend, but perhaps Wigan could have used a spark from somewhere.

Instead it came after the final whistle, again from Rosler, who said he would have been ‘devastated with a point’, such were the chances Wigan created.

Nicky Maynard’s second-half strike ensured they got nothing and Rosler was clearly furious as he considered a third game without victory, highlighting in particular the need to find striking reinforcements from a ‘destroyed market’.

‘You think there will be more teams who dominate here like this?’ Rosler said. ‘I don’t think so. We were dominant for 90 minutes apart from putting the ball in the net.’

He added: ‘When you see our last three games and especially here, everybody knows we have to do something on that part (in attack).

‘We have players who are very good, but I think we need more pace and more Championship experience up front. That is what we will try to get. I know the market is more or less destroyed in the Premier League and Championship.’

Waghorn’s miss was poor, while Marc-Antoine Fortune and Oriol Riera were also wasteful. But to say Cardiff were lucky would be unkind and not entirely accurate.

This is a team that, unlike Wigan, has started the season rather well, taking seven points from three games.

Unlike Rosler, Solskjaer carried a grin as the punters left the ground. ‘When a football club starts winning games it creates a better atmosphere in the ground, the offices, the stadium, in the pubs,’ Solskjaer said. ‘We didn’t play well know we can improve.’

The Norwegian has had the benefit of ‘a hell of a lot of money’, as Rosler pointed out. And with it he has built a strong, if unbalanced squad. His defence worked well last night, barring the conceded chances that sent Rosler into a spin, but if this promotion bid falls flat it will likely be down to the depth of the back line.

The departure of Kevin Theophile-Catherine on loan to Saint Etienne this week has heightened those issues, with Solskjaer admitting: ‘We really would have wanted to keep him but he wanted to go back to France for different reasons. Sometimes you have to answer the boy’s prayers. It has left us a little unbalanced in that position.’

But otherwise, Cardiff are in good shape, even if they are yet to find their upper gears. Gunnarsson drew an excellent save from Scott Carson inside two minutes and Maynard then fluffed his lines after a dreadful pass from Carson landed at his feet in the 21st minute. The striker had a clear path to goal but dallied and allowed Don Cowie to challenge.

Callum McManaman caused Cardiff some early issues at the other end, most notably when he left Fabio da Silva on his backside and also when he drew a fingertip save from David Marshall with a header.

But Cardiff broke through after 53 minutes and probably deserved it. Fabio delivered a cross from the left, Sean Morrison diverted it back across goal with the help of a Kenwyne Jones flick. Maynard bundled it across the line.

Wigan then wasted their chances to level and Rosler looked ready to blow. ‘We need to get points on the board,’ he said. ‘We must not lose belief and confidence.’
