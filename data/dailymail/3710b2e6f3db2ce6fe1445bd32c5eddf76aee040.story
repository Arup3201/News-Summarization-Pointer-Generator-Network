While many people might enjoy looking out at a storm while huddled up inside their house, farmer Anne-Marie Cotterell is not one of them.

That's because the 40-year-old has a herd of 340 cattle to protect, and worries that they could be killed if they are hit by lightning.

So when she checked on the animals after a recent storm and found them all safe and well, she celebrated the occasion by taking a selfie with one of her favourites.  

Farmer Anne-Marie Cotterell, 40, took this selfie with one of her cows while checking on the herd after a storm and realising they had all survived

The 18 month-old Warrenbury Shottle Dutchess heifer nuzzled up to Anne-Marie’s shoulder as she took the snap at her farm in Masbury, Somerset.

She said: 'This little heifer is my baby princess, we love to have a natter in the mornings. This photo was extra special as I was so worried about all our cattle out in the lightning.

'They tend to bunch together when frightened under trees and it has been known that if tree gets struck it will kill most of them and she is in a bunch of 40 others.

'I can’t ever get around to check them quick enough after a storm as they are my babies and I would be broken if I found them hurt, dead or dying.

'All were fine thank goodness so I am very happy.'

Ms Cotterell said cows often shelter in large groups underneath trees while frightened, and so are vulnerable to lightning jumping from the tree and into their bodies
