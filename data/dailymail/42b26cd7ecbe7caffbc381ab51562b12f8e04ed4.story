These stunning photographs show a lost vision of New York City, where streetcars barreled down Third Avenue, the Empire State Building was the tallest in town - and five cents could get you a a bag of fresh-roasted peanuts.

Taken by photographer Todd Webb in 1946, the collection of 15 black and white images show the then-bustling docks of Manhattan, the skyline as it was before glass-clad skyscrapers rose up in decades to come - and the people who called the city home.

Webb was around 40 years old when the images were taken, and had just returned from a posting as a Naval Photographer in the Second World War.

Old smokey days: This collection of photographs by Todd Webb has been republished - the above showing the New York City skyline in 1946, when the Empire State Building (right) and Chrysler building (center left) were still the tallest two structures in the metropolis

Old-school: The images show yesteryear NYC transportation, including the image to the left of the now-demolished Third Avenue El train metro line, with a street car running underneath. To the right, a photograph taken at the interaction of Second Avenue and 50th Street shows the Chrysler Building standing tall, not yet surrounded by other midtown high-rises

Working man: In this famous image, taken around Battery Park in Manhtattan, shows a local tradesman selling roasted peanuts on the street for five cents a bag

From the docks: The photographs show how Manhattan's ports and piers still thronged with trade ships. This is the scene from the Fulton Fish Market Wharf

As well as the iconic sights and architecture of the metropolis, Webb's images also took in locals around his Harlem neighborhood, and working folk around the city. 

The images have been brought out of the archives and published again in a limited-edition collection by 21st Editions.

According to photography experts, Webb, who won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955, was notable in getting to know the subjects of his portraits before shooting - sometimes spending days talking before wielding the camera.

In an introduction to the images, Harvard professor John Stauffer wrote how Webb was also unusual in taking an interest in photographing black people and interracial friendships - the kind he would have seen on the streets of Harlem around him.

Although the year was blighted by the death of his mentor Alfred Stieglitz, Webb - who died in 2000 - remembered it as one of best and most productive.

Pals: This photograph, called 123rd Street (Boys with Toy Gun) shows a black child and white friends playing in Harlem. Webb's writings show how he despised racism - describing seeing 'Whites Only' signs on a visit to the segregated South 'hard to take'

Famous: This image, published in Fortune magazine, shows the view of downtown Manhattan from the Empire State Building - then the highest view in the city. The same vista would now be dominated by the World Trade Center's Freedom Tower

In harmony: This photograph, called 'The Circle,' LaSalle at Amsterdam, shows a group of black and white children playing together around a pipe spraying water

Towering: This photograph, taken at the intersection of Madison Street and Pike Street, shows the view south towards the Manhattan Bridge

Harlem scenes: These photographs a hat store in Harlem's 125th street, and the nearby offices of The People's Voice, a weekly black newspaper, with a local standing outside. The paper had just moved offices

Fine motor: This image shows the car of Lamar Perkins, a prominent Harlem citizen and New York state's assistant attorney general

Sneaky shot: Webb described how this photograph was taken the first time he walked over the Brooklyn Bridge - with only enough film for six frames. When he returned the next day with more, officials were enforcing a photography ban - so he had to turn back

Commerce: This image shows traders on Suffolk Street, near Manhattan's Chinatown

Relaxing: Webb found these five boys on a street in Harlem, and asked them to pose for him - a process documented in his other photos, too

NYC had a very different skyline in those days, when Empire State Building still dominated the city
