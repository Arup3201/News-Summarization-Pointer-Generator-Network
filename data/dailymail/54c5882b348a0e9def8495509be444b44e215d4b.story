This is the moment an adventurer who was set to become the first person to swim, cycle and run the entire length of the United Kingdom was forced to abandon his challenge after twisting his ankle while taking a selfie.

Sean Conway, 33, had already become the first person in Britain to swim from Land's End to John O'Groats and had followed it up with cycling the length of the country too.

However, the ultimate stage of his triathlon challenge – which was to run from Scotland to Cornwall – has now been scuppered after he fell over a rock and injured himself just 200 miles into the run.

Sean Conway, 33, was attempting to run the length of the UK between John O'Groats and Land's End when he tripped over a rock and twisted his ankle while attempting to record a video selfie in the Loch Ness area

He caught the accident on his camera as he fell over a rock in a field about 200 miles from his starting point

The footage shows Mr Conway tumble over the rock and drop the camera on the floor as he winces in pain

He has now been forced to abandon the last leg of his triathlon - which would've seen him become the first person to swim, cycle and run the length of the UK. He had already completed the swim and cycle stages

Mr Conway dropped his camera after tripping over and could be heard wincing in pain before retrieving it

The keen adventurer tried to continue but the injury put pressure on his knee and after limping on for a couple of days he was forced to abandon his final challenge in Loch Ness after just 200 miles – around 700 miles short of his goal.

Footage of him tripping over the rock was included in his video diary of his epic marathon and shows him speaking to the camera before falling to the ground - dropping the camera in the process - and wincing in pain. 

Cycle (completed) - 1,300 miles meandering from John Land's End to John O'Groats, leaving on April 1, 2008 and taking one month.

Swim (completed) - 900 miles swimming from Land's End to John O'Groats, via the east coast of Ireland, leaving on June 30, 2013, and finishing on November 11, 2013.

Run (abandoned) - 1,000 miles from John O'Groats to Land's End, departing on August 9. However, he suffered the selfie slip at the end of the third day in Loch Ness. He was due to finish the run in mid-September but  was forced to quit on Wednesday.

Total challenge: 3,200 miles.

Mr Conway, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: 'I was doing a video selfie and I was just running along and I tripped up on a rock and slightly injured my ankle.

'But it really wasn't a serious injury at all - I was stretching and it was okay so I carried on running.

'Over the next few days with my ankle being injured and my knees taking over, some bad terrain and camber issues on the side of the road, all added to pressure building on my knees.

'I did take it easy, things were going well until a few days ago a simple wrong footing sent my body one way and my knee the other.

'Immediate pain. I knew straight away it was game over.'

The adventurer embarked on the Great British Triathlon in 2008 and swam the length of the UK before cycling it last year. After being forced to abandon the final leg - the run - of the challenge, he wants to try it again in May

Mr Conway was set to become the first person to swim, cycle and run the length of the UK. However, after completing the swim and cycle stages of his triathlon, he failed at the final hurfle by injuring himself on the run

Writing on his blog, he added: 'It saddens me to say this, but I've finally been defeated by my body.

'I've taken a beating over the years, fractured spine when I got run over in America, stung by jellyfish in the face repeatedly for four months at sea, dislocated shoulders, ribs and thumbs falling down hills etc, but I have always somehow managed to carry on.

'This time however things haven't gone so well.'

Mr Conway embarked on his Great British Triathlon in 2008 when he cycled 969 miles from Land's End to John O'Groats.

Mr Conway became the first person in Britain to swim from Land's End to John O'Groats in November last year

Mr Conway spent 90 days in the water during the 1,000 mile swim from Land's End to Scotland last year

The keen photographer said he lost a stone in weight after completing the swim stage of the challenge 

He then became the first person to swim the length of the UK last November after covering 900 miles during 135 days at sea from Cornwall to the tip of Scotland.

He began his final leg on August 9 and ran along the north coast of Scotland and made it to Loch Ness before conceding defeat.

The keen photographer said he now plans to rest for a few months before returning to training and re-attempting the final leg of the triathlon next May.
