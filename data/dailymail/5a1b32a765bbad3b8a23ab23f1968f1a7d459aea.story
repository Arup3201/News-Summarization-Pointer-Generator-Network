Paul Lambert has asked supporters not to take part in a planned Holte End walkout and instead provide vocal backing to Aston Villa as their match kicks off against Liverpool.

Three fan sites have launched a campaign for those with tickets in Villa Park’s famous stand to leave their seat vacant for the first eight minutes on Saturday, to mark the number of seasons owner Randy Lerner has been in charge.

Supporters have grown frustrated at another stagnating campaign, following on from four years of struggle, which has seen Villa score just 11 Premier League goals.

Chants against Lambert were aired in the defeat at Leicester City and in the minutes before Christian Benteke scored a late winner against Blackpool in the FA Cup.

Lambert said he understood fan frustrations but said backing the team would mean greater chance of victory.

‘Everybody involved with Aston Villa will be frustrated at what has happened over the last five or six years since Martin O'Neill left and the team was in the top six,’ said Lambert. ‘Martin had this club buzzing at that time, vying for Europe, going great, and what's happened has happened.

‘But I don't think you can look at the chairman and say it's one guy's fault. It's unfair. He has the club's interest at heart.

‘I understand the fans' frustrations, but we'll have a better chance of winning a game of football if they don't do it, if they stick with the lads, no matter how hard it gets at times.

‘Whoever has planned [the demonstration], I hope the guy next to them tries to keep them on their seat.’
