Endurance swimmer Penny Palfrey has had to end 
her effort to become the first woman to swim unassisted from Cuba to the
Florida Keys because of an unusually strong and dangerous current.

Andrea 
Woodburn, one of the team members, says Palfrey halted her effort early 
Sunday about 26 miles south of Key West and about three quarters of the way along. because of the changing conditions

Woodburn says she was in contact with Palfrey's boat and 
was told the swimmer had gotten out of the water right around midnight 
EDT. Woodburn says the British-born Australian is fine but gave no 
further details.

Earlier on Palfrey had crossed the 
halfway mark on Saturday as she pushed through the shark-infested waters
in her 103-mile marathon swim between Cuba and Florida.

Facing
jellyfish stings but otherwise encountering perfect conditions in her 
attempt to become the first woman to swim unassisted the Cuba to Florida
route, the 49-year old grandmother seemed set to complete her task.

A GPS tracking device on 
Palfrey's support boat a few meters away from the swimmer showed she 
reached the halfway point near midday, according to her website.

Palfrey had been swimming steady and strong
and reported no physical complaints.

She had finished 69 miles around 3
p.m. Saturday, breaking her personal best when she swam 67 miles 
between Little Cayman and Grand Cayman islands last year, according to 
crew member Andrea Woodburn.

Palfrey reapplied sunscreen and grease
to prevent chafing and said the water conditions had been excellent 
other than the extreme heat.

She even spotted a few hammerhead sharks 
and dolphin pods. Crew members said she was barking orders at team 
members accompanying her on kayaks and a catamaran as she kept up a 
torrid pace in a battle that tested the limits of human endurance.

Wish me luck: Penny Palfrey says goodbye before beginning her bid to complete a record swim from Cuba to Florida. She aims to be the first woman to swim the Straits of Florida without the aid of a shark cage

And away she goes: The 49-year-old grandmother dives in to start her epic swim to Florida

Earlier, at 8:38 a.m. EDT (1248 GMT), a
little over 25 hours into the swim, the 49-year-old grandmother was 48 
miles (77 kilometers) from her starting point at a marina in the Cuban 
capital, Scott Woodburn, who is part of Palfrey's landing team in the 
Florida Keys, told The Associated Press.

She is 'alert and swimming physically 
strong,' Woodburn said, adding that the bathwater-warm waters remained 
calm. 'It couldn't be better for her.'

The 20-year veteran of distance swimming is no stranger to jellyfish stings, which forced her to abort two past swims in Hawaii.

The British-born, Australian swimmer 
set off from Havana early Friday. A member of Palfrey's crew was 
tweeting to fans, while a webpage updated her location every 10 minutes 
or so based on data from a GPS device worn by the swimmer.

The site 
briefly went down overnight when it had to be reset, but was working 
again early Saturday morning.

As she endures a second day, Palfrey 
will have to fight through physical and mental fatigue while fending off
dehydration, hypothermia and dangerous marine life.

At her current 
rate, it would take her a bit more than 56 hours to complete the swim, 
slightly above her initial estimates. She would get to Florida Sunday 
afternoon.

If Palfrey succeeds, she'll go in the 
record books as the first woman to swim the Straits without the aid of a
shark cage.

Instead she's relying on equipment that surrounds her with 
an electrical field to deter the predators. Her support team consisted 
of more than a dozen navigators, handlers and medical personnel who were
escorting her on the 44-foot (13-meter) catamaran Sealuver.

Australian Susie Maroney made the 
crossing in 1997 at age 22, but with a shark cage. American Diana Nyad 
made two unsuccessful cageless attempts last year on either side of her 
62nd birthday, but had to call them off due to a debilitating asthma 
attack and painful Portuguese man o' war stings. She plans to try again 
this summer.

Palfrey began the swim in a regular 
sporting swimsuit, but said Friday that she planned to put on a porous, 
non-buoyant Lycra bodysuit that provides cover down to the wrists and 
ankles whenever jellyfish may be a threat.

'Every single swim is individual. Each swim comes with its own challenges. This is a really big challenge, the Florida Straits, 103 miles,' the well-tanned, muscular Palfrey said.

The swim was completed successfully in May 1997 by Australian Susan Maroney, who unlike Nyad and Palfrey, used a shark cage for protection.

Maroney was 22 at the time, but Palfrey, who has three grown children and two grandchildren, dismissed the idea that her age could be an impediment.

'I think my track record speaks for itself,' she said.

Last June, Palfrey captured the world
record for what are referred to as 'unassisted open ocean swims' by 
swimming 67.25 miles (109 km) in the Cayman Islands, Cuba's fellow 
Caribbean country.

Ms Palfrey will have to contend with venomous jellyfish as well as the sharks that like to swim alongside people

Her resume contains a long list of 
marathon swims, including twice across the English Channel, a round trip
in the Strait of Gibraltar and three swims around Manhattan Island.

She decided to take on the Florida Straits after flying over on her way back from the record-breaking Cayman swim.

'We
flew from Grand Cayman island to Miami and out of my window on the 
airplane I could see the Florida Straits. We flew over Cuba and I could 
see Miami and it was such a beautiful sight,' she said.

She started researching the straits when she got home and before long, she 'was already hooked.'

As Nyad did, she will get liquids and food at regular intervals that she must take without touching the boat.

There were reports that her crew killed several sharks that approached during her Cayman Island swim, but Palfrey said that was not true and would not happen on this swim.

'We don't kill sharks. We love the ocean. We like to preserve the ocean,' she said.

Palfrey had planned to make her attempt a few days ago, but had to wait for Tropical Storm Debby to stop churning in the Gulf of Mexico off northwestern Florida.
