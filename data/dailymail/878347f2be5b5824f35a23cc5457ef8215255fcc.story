It is widely credited as kick-starting the demise of Nazi Germany in one of the most bloody wars witnessed in history.

Now a reenactment group is bringing back to life the tide-turning moment that more than 150,000 troops landed on the beaches in Normandy, in the largest amphibious invasion in history.

The historic day is being recreated to mark the 70th anniversary of when troops waded or parachuted onto French soil, as part of the famous Second World War D-Day landings.

These French teenagers are part of a Second World War reenactment group 
which has headed to 'Gold Beach' - one of the five sections of coasts in the D-Day landings - to mark the 70th Anniversary of the historic landings

Members of the Second World War reenactment group arrived at Arromanches-les-bains earlier today, ahead of the reenactment which will take place on Friday - the 70th anniversary of D-Day

Normandy veterans attended a ceremony at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard earlier today as part of the anniversary ceremonies, before they prepared to embark for France

It is part of a series of events planned all over the area for the anniversary, as many head of states and veterans make their way to the Normandy beaches.

The landings saw nearly 160,000 troops from the allied countries - including the United Kingdom and the United States - join forces to launch an audacious attack on the beaches of Normandy.

These assaults historically mark the start of the eventual defeat of the regime in Nazi Germany with General Dwight Eisenhower - who led the assault - afterwards declaring that the 'tide had turned'.

And every effort has been made to ensure this year's ceremonies are a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives during the assault.

On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied 
troops died, while another 9,000 were wounded or declared missing. Total German 
casualties are estimated at being between 4,000 and 9,000.

The reenactment group has already arrived in Arromanche next to 'Gold 
Beach' and near to 'Omaha Beach' - two of the five sectors in which the coast was divided - ready for the demonstration on Friday.

The reenactment is just one of several events taking place along the D-Day beaches to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the assault

On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died and a further 9,000 were wounded or declared missing

The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, 
Sword, Omaha, Utah and Gold. The reenactment will take place along the coast

The men have been driving jeeps along the
 sand, loading up military trucks and carrying their vital weapons - all of 
which will be recreated on the anniversary.Â 

The D-Day landings took place on June 6, 1944, when allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, France.

The landings, codenamed 
Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies'
 assault on German-occupied territory.

The landings, codenamed Operation Nepture, were a turning point in the war, as it lead to the liberation of occupied Europe

Some of the reenactors - these from Spain - have been practising scaling a 
seawall on the Avenue de la Liberation, which runs parallel to Omaha Beach
 June in Vierville, France, as part of the planned display

The history enthusiasts will wear replica uniforms - these one being US American Airborne 
uniforms - to ensure the historic day is properly brought back to life

The mission involved around 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians.

There was an initial airborne assault with more than 23,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn.

The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah.

Omaha Beach for the event on Friday

After the assault - which was the largest amphibious assault in history - General Dwight Eisenhower declared that 'the tide had turned'

The landings were a turning point in 
the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing
 on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied 
Europe.

After the invasion, Eisenhower said: 'The tide has 
turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!'

To mark the 70th anniversary an 
international flotilla of ships will sail through the channel to 
Normandy before an international ceremony on Sword Beach.

Poignant services led by the British 
and the French will be held at Bayeux Cathedral followed by an event at 
the Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.

There will be a service organised by the Normandy Veterans Association and local people at Arromanches.

In the UK, a flypast at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, where a specially painted Typhoon jet will be unveiled.

Portsmouth
 will be the main focus of events to mark the historic D-Day invasion 
and was chosen because thousands of allied troops left there for 
Normandy.

Twenty years ago, to mark the 50th annivesary of the landings, veterans performed a march-past on Gold Beach at Arromanches, France, where a reenactment will take place this week
