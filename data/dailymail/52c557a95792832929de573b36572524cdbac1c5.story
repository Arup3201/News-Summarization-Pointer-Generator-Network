A 47-year-old woman has been charged with sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy by sneaking into his bedroom to perform oral sex.

The alleged victim told investigators that Keturah Zillah Gibson would wake him after 2am and carry out the sex acts.

He said she would kiss him and perform oral sex at the house they shared in Pembroke Pines, Florida.

Keturah Zillah Gibson, 47, has been charged with multiple counts of lewd and lascivious battery and molestation of a 12-year-old who lived in the same house in Pembroke Pines, Florida

Gibson was charged on Monday with multiple counts of lewd and lascivious battery and molestation of a 12-year-old boy and with tampering with a victim.

According to police Gibson sent instant 
messages to the boy telling him if their encounters were ever discovered
 he was to say they 'never ever' had sex.

Gibson, who doesn't have a police record, has denied the accusations and said she never performed sexual acts on the boy.

During two police interviews Gibson told detectives the boy had kissed her, attempted to place her hand on his buttocks on one occasion, and that the attention made her feel good.

The victim told a different story and alleged between June 2012 and December 2013 they had between five and ten sexual encounters.

The boy said Gibson sent him a message 
with instructions that he should not tell anyone, that she had spoken 
with an attorney and that as long as there was no sexual activity she 
could not be arrested.

Gibson was ordered to surrender her passport and has been detained in Broward County Jail on $110,000 bond

Gibson was arrested on Sunday after the boy's mum said she wanted to bring charges.

When Gibson appeared before Broward County Judge John Hurley on multiple lewd and lascivious charges she was ordered to stay away from her alleged victim.

Gibson was also charged with witness tampering and molestation.

She was also ordered to surrender her passport and remained in a Broward jail Tuesday on $110,000 bond, records show.

Hurley appointed a Guardian ad Litem for the boy and asked a prosecutor to notify the Florida Department of Children and Families.
