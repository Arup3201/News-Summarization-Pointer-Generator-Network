Another hotel masseur is claiming he had a homosexual tryst with John Travolta.

Unlike the first two – one of whom withdrew his lawsuit on Tuesday and the first accuser who dropped his case – this latest man to come forward with gay sex claims involving the actor is named.

Former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez said he spent an afternoon with the Pulp Fiction star at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel, California, in 1997.

Meanwhile, another unnamed man has made claims today that Travolta accosted him - making it the fifth man to make allegations about the star.

More claims: A named hotel masseur is alleging he had a homosexual encounter with John Travolta at a hotel in California back in 1997

The man - a gym employee - has accused Travolta of fondling him against his wishes when he worked out at the gym while he was shooting a movie, according to RadarOnline.

However no details were reported regarding the time frame or location. Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer has denied the allegations.

Last week Fabian Zanzi became the third man to accuse Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

Gonzalez made his claims to the National Enquirer magazine in the US, saying of the actor: 'He’s a great kisser. I know because I had sex with him and he loved it.’

He added that the 58-year-old married actor seemed 'very experienced’ at gay sex. 'I can remember it like it happened yesterday,’ he added.

The masseur said the rendezvous started minutes after he set up his table in Mr Travolta’s room.

The actor reportedly stripped down and said it was too warm for a top sheet. 

Mr Gonzalez described how Travolta became aroused soon after lying on the table.

'He moved around and started to breathe heavily,' he recalled.

'We got right into the bed that was right there next to the massage table and had a really good time.’

The 49-year-old, who is now living overseas, said he had massaged the actor several times since first meeting him in 1988 without anything sexual happening.

The first masseur - dubbed John Doe#1 - has now called in celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred after dropping the lawsuit earlier this week

'Travolta may not identify himself as a gay man, but it doesn’t dismiss the fact that he likes sex with men .. and he’s experienced at it,’ he said.

'I was in shock for about a week afterward thinking, 'I can’t believe it! I had sex with John Travolta!'

'I was hoping to see him again after that, but I never did,’ he told the Enquirer.

The first masseur who claimed last week that he was groped by Mr Travolta during a private massage in Beverly Hills in January was forced to drop his case after it emerged that the actor was 3,000 miles away in New York at the time of the alleged incident.

But he hired celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred yesterday and was said to be considering whether or not to refile the lawsuit.

'We are in the process of conferring with him regarding the next steps, which he may wish to take,’ Ms Allred said yesterday.

The other massage therapist accused Mr. Travolta of sexual misconduct at an Atlanta hotel in January.

The star’s lawyer has denied the claims.
