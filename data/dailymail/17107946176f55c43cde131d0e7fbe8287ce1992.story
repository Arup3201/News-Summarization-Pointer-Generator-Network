 She scaled 8.5 metre towers in full uniform, sprinted up 86 flights of stairs and beat 5,000 other hopefuls to be named the World's Toughest Firefighter.

But today super-fit Suzanne Enghed will be back at work doing what she truly does best - saving lives.

The 33-year-old triumphed at the World Firefighter Games in Sydney, Australia - winning four gold medals and one silver.

Fighting fit: Suzanne Enghed has been crowned the World's Toughest Firefighter

The keen sportswoman, who works at Cheltenham West station in Gloucestershire, triumphed in four events to claim her title against 5,000 female firefighters from across the globe.

She took on tasks including dashing up 86 flights of steps at Sydney Tower - all while dressed in full firefighting gear and breathing apparatus.

The gold medallist, who previously won the same title in Korea in 2010, said: 'I'm very proud to have defended my title.

'My colleagues at the station have been very supportive.

'We did car washes and stair climbs to raise money for me to travel to Sydney.'

The pretty blonde completed an eye-watering series of firefighter related tasks in under 12 minutes, blitzing the field of other top female firefighters.

The tasks involved physical strength, such as carrying three rolled up hoses over 90 metres and then unrolling and connecting them.

She said her most daunting task was climbing over a three-metre high wall in full firefighting gear, including breathing apparatus and hefty boots.

The firefighter took on tasks including dashing up 86 flights of steps at Sydney Tower (pictured) - all while dressed in full firefighting gear and breathing apparatus.

She then had to haul an 80kg dummy 90 metres, scale a ladder up an 8.5 metre tower - having dragged it there.

Suzanne added: 'It was really like a sprint because in between each of the four parts you only got a five-minutes rest, which was enough time to take your tunic off and try to cool down.

'It was no time at all really, and it was very, very hard.'

Suzanne also won gold in rowing, stair climbing and female doubles tennis and silver in mixed doubles tennis.

The first World Firefighters Games event was held in 1990, in Auckland, New Zealand and has been held every two years since.

It is an inclusive event that celebrates the camaraderie, heroism, health, fitness and spirit of the men and women who work in one of the world’s most respected professions.

Some of those who compete are professional athletes as well as firefighters.
