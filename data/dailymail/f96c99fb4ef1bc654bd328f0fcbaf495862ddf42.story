The controversial £100 fine for late income-tax returns could be axed after the taxman admitted it was punishing honest taxpayers who miss the deadline by a day.

HM Revenue and Customs said it may hit workers unfairly for making a ‘simple mistake’ or an ‘uncharacteristic failure’.

At the moment, those who return their tax form even just 24 hours late are billed £100 – the same as someone who misses the deadline by almost three months.

HM Revenue & Customs said it wants to 'change the way that penalties are applied' after admitting the current system doesn't differentiate between deliberate non-compliers and those who make an accidental error

It is now considering replacing the automatic fine – which has been in place for 20 years – with motoring-style penalty points designed to punish repeat offenders.

The proposal could mean hundreds of thousands of Britons who fail to complete the complex self-assessment forms on time every year could escape a penalty.

Under plans put out for public consultation, HMRC said the system ‘makes no distinction between a customer who misses a deadline by a day or two and someone who has made no attempt to comply at all’.

It added: ‘We want to consider whether we could better differentiate between deliberate and persistent non-compliers and those who might make an occasional error.

‘One option could be a progressive system similar to penalty points for motoring offences so that initial financial penalties are avoided, but more substantial penalties then apply for more serious failures or for persistent non-compliance.’

Hundreds of thousands of middle-class families were dragged into filling out self-assessment forms for the first time last year following cuts to child benefit for higher-rate taxpayers. Thousands were then hit with fines when they failed to fill out their assessments on time.

Under the new proposals, which are up for public consultation, high interest rates could be applied to taxpayers' debts - which may encourage them to pay up sooner - instead of fines being issues by HMRC

HMRC said it would also look at extending the list of reasonable excuses it will accept for late tax returns. The Government will currently waive a penalty only for the death of a spouse, an unexpected hospital stay or a fire. 

Under current regulations, those who didn't complete their self-assessment tax return forms by midnight on the January 31 deadline will immediately receive a £100 penalty, even if they had no tax to pay.

If the forms still have not been completed after three months, £10 a day will be added to the fine, up to a maximum of £900.

After six months, an additional penalty of either five per cent of the tax due or £300 - whichever is greater - will be added.

This amount will be added again if the tax return has still not been completed 12 months after the deadline.

On last year's deadline day, 557,000 people scrambled to get their returns in online and some 700,000 missed the deadline. 

Having difficulty filling out the complicated form, forgetting the deadline or struggling with your first self-assessment are not accepted. Officials said the list of excuses ‘may need updating to better support those genuinely wanting to comply’.

This year, more than 10.2million tax forms were returned before the deadline of midnight on January 31, but 890,000 people were late.

Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants said the current penalties were used as an unjust source of income for the Government. He added: ‘We seem to have lost sight of the fact that the taxpayer is the unpaid administrator of tax compliance and we should be looking to smarter ways of dealing with late filers.’

HMRC acknowledged that taxpayers are fined for late returns even when they do not owe any money.

Before 2012, a penalty was cancelled if no tax was due.

The taxman said fines also could be counter-productive if they ‘undermine people’s natural motivation to comply’. If penalties are deemed to be unfair or disproportionate, it said, ‘research suggests this can lead to increased non-compliance’.

But Stuart Phillips, of wealth management firm The Private Office, said: ‘It makes a lot of sense to create more targeted fines for those who are intentionally choosing not to comply with self-assessment.

‘But the removal of the automatic fine could reduce the motivation for people to ensure their returns are submitted on time.’
