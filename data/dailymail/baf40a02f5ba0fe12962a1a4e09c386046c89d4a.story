Ten million beefburgers are being recalled in the scandal over horse meat contamination, it emerged yesterday.

As revulsion over the issue grew, more supermarkets and fast food chain Burger King were drawn into the row.

Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-op have decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a precautionary measure.

The firms acted because the products were made by an Irish food giant which is known to have been supplying burgers contaminated with horse meat.

Separately, Burger King confirmed it gets burgers from the same company. However, it said there has been an ‘absolute assurance’ that these are not contaminated.

Food watchdogs in the UK and Ireland are racing to establish whether products made for other retailers, take-aways and restaurants are contaminated.

Last night the Government and the Food Standards Agency announced a UK wide survey into the authenticity of burgers and other processed meat products.

The revelations have been met with anger and disgust, while the companies involved face prosecutions for misleading shoppers.

Speaking at Prime Minister’s Question Time, David Cameron, said: ‘People in our country will have been very concerned to read this morning that when they thought they were buying beefburgers they were buying something with horse meat in it. This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs.’

He warned the stores involved, saying: ‘Ultimately retailers have to be responsible for what it is they sell and where it comes from.’

The alert was first raised by Irish food watchdogs earlier this week after horse DNA was found in burgers sold through Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland.

It subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and Iceland. The beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat.

The tests were carried out in November but the results were not released until they had been checked by experts in Germany. It is likely that many thousands of the burgers contaminated with horse meat have been eaten by families.

Investigations are focussing on the role of Irish food company, ABP, which is run by controversial entrepreneur Larry Goodman.

ABP owns Silvercrest Foods, which supplied burgers containing horse meat to Tesco and Aldi. It also makes cheap burgers for Asda, Co-op and Burger King.

ABP also owns Dalepak, which is based in North Yorkshire and made suspect burgers for Iceland. It also produces 13 lines for Sainsbury’s.

Yesterday, ABP pointed the finger at a mystery ingredient used in the burgers – thought to be a protein powder – supplied by two foreign firms, one in the Netherlands and another in Spain.

The powder – used to bulk up cheap burgers – is supposed to be created from rendered down carcasses of beef animals.

The episode lifts the lid on some of the more distasteful elements and ingredients used to produce cheap food for families on a budget.

Professor Chris Elliott, director of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen’s University, Belfast said: ‘What goes into a burger is all the low quality cuts of meat that can’t be sold in any other form. They are at the bottom of the chain.’

The FSA will look at launching legal action with breaches of food labelling rules bringing fines up to £20,000 and a prison term of up to two years.

The Irish research also identified that a number of other beef products, such as ready meal cottage pies, contained pig meat that was not declared on the label. This has serious implications for the Muslim and Jewish communities who are forbidden from eating pork.

Tesco had no idea about the contamination and has apologised. Its group technical director, Tim Smith, said: ‘Our customers have the right to expect that food they buy is produced to the highest standards.’

Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op all insisted there was no evidence their burgers contain horse meat. However, they decided to withdraw them because they come from firms  which are known to have had this problem.

Sainsbury’s said: ‘Although our products have not been implicated, as our customers would expect we treat matters like this extremely seriously.’ Asda said: ‘As soon as we were made aware of the issue we launched a full traceability audit with our supplier.’

Co-op said it was removing two lines of frozen own-brand burgers while tests are carried out ‘to ensure they have been produced to our strict specifications’.

Burger King said it has been given ‘absolute assurance’ by ABP and Silvercrest that none of its burgers were affected. It said its burgers are produced with clean ingredients on a separate production line.

For many, it is simply a matter of economics.

While calling the vet to put down a lame or surplus horse can cost in excess of £200, abattoirs will gladly pay £300 for an unwanted animal.

As a result, 8,118 horses and ponies were slaughtered in Britain in 2011, to be sent to the continent to be sold as gourmet meat.

Nothing is wasted, with their skins going into the leather trade, while any off-cuts will be used as dog food.

Most will be former pets their owners cannot care for or riding school mounts that can no longer pay their way because they are too old to work.

But according to Ben Martin, a campaigner with charity Animal Aid, in 2011 ‘1,127 were thoroughbreds discarded by the racing industry’, which ‘overproduces horses each year’.

The number of British horses ending their days in the slaughterhouse has doubled since 2008, a little-known consequence of the recession. Mr Martin said around 10,000 horses and ponies are now believed to be slaughtered in Britain each year.

‘With belt-tightening following the recession, it is often luxuries such as horses that face the chop,’ he said.

‘It makes sense they would end up in slaughterhouses rather than paying a vet a  fee or trying to sell them on.

‘The real scandal behind the horse slaughter figures is that the volume of horses being produced for the pet and horse racing industries is unregulated and out of control.’

Permitted methods of slaughter include shooting with a bullet, or stunning with a penetrative bolt followed by immediate bleeding.

There are two major abattoirs that take horses in Britain, but they are not keen on publicising it.

Several thousand live horses are believed to be sent to the continent for slaughter. Customers in France, Belgium and Italy like horse meat. Small amounts are also eaten in Spain, Portugal, Holland and Romania.

A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said almost all British horse meat is exported. ‘It is legal to slaughter and sell horse meat in the UK, provided it is from an approved abattoir and the meat must carry the stamp declaring it is fit for human consumption,’ he added.
