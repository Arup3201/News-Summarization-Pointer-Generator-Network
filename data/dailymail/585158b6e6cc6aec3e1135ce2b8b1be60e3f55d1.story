Laughing as they stroll together, this is £148million lottery winner Adrian Bayford with the new woman in his life – a Polish-born former sausage factory worker.

Marta Jarosz is said to be working as the newly-single 43-year-old’s bodyguard and driver, after he moved out of the £6million Cambridgeshire estate he bought with wife Gillian, 41.

And it seems the pair have hit it off – so much so that rumours of a romance between them reached a newspaper in her native Poland.

Working relationship: Adrian Bayford at Stansted Airport with 'bodyguard and driver' Marta Jarosz

When asked about 30-year-old Miss Jarosz the multimillionaire insisted she was not his lover, saying: ‘I am not with Marta. She works for me and that’s it.’

His denial came as Miss Jarosz’s mother rejected claims her daughter is a gold-digger, adding that money ‘wouldn’t change Marta’.

But the pair looked at ease in each other’s company as they arrived at Stansted Airport on Friday. Joking in the sunshine, with only one small suitcase between them, they could have been mistaken for a couple embarking on a weekend away.

Miss Jarosz did not seem to be performing any sort of security role, carrying a £200 leather Fossil designer handbag on her arm and wearing knee-high heeled boots.

Their nine-year marriage 'broke down irretrievably' 15 months after the second biggest UK lottery win ever

Speaking about their relationship for the first time last night, Mr Bayford said Miss Jarosz was employed by him and that he had been going to visit his children, who are thought to have moved to Dundee with their mother after she found love with car dealer Alan Warnock.

He added: ‘I was not on a holiday with Marta.’

Mr and Mrs Bayford revealed in November that their nine-year marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ 15 months after they scooped the second biggest lottery prize ever won in Britain.

Since then, Miss Jarosz is said to have become a regular visitor to Mr Bayford’s new house and has been seen driving a £34,000 Volvo V40 hatchback thought to be a gift from the father-of-two, who cannot drive.

His best friend Richard Hudspith said the pair, who have known each other for a while, had struck up a ‘friendly relationship’.

Miss Jarosz, who lives in a terraced house in Haverhill, Suffolk, close to Mr Bayford’s home, used to work at sausage supplier Dalehead Foods in Linton, Cambridgeshire, according to her online CV. 

She is thought to have met Mr Bayford at a nightclub, when she was working as a bouncer. But she has told her parents she is not in a relationship with him.

Speaking at home in rural Poland, Edzia Jarosz denied that her daughter was interested in the 20-stone millionaire for his money and said she was working as his ‘bodyguard and driver’.

‘She wouldn’t be interested in him because he is too rich… She knows that money can’t buy you love and that there are more important things in life,’ said Mrs Jarosz, who first learned of the rumoured romance when it was reported in a Polish newspaper.

‘We are not poor. We have a very profitable 30-hectare farm… and we’ve bought our own combine harvester … no money would ever change us and it wouldn’t change Marta either.’
