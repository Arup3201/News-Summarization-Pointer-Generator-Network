Spy: Fritz Lustig was hired by British intelligence to eavesdrop on German PoWs held in Britain

A wartime refugee has revealed how he was hired by the British secret service to eavesdrop on Nazi prisoners of war talking to each other in their cells.

Jewish Fritz Lustig, 93, has told for the first time how he listened to German prisoners captured by British troops discussing their involvement in the Holocaust and other atrocities during World War II.

He was one of hundreds of refugees who fled to the UK from Germany and was hired by British intelligence to spy on prisoners because of they were bilingual.

Mr Lustig described how he and other refugees worked shifts to listen in on captives chatting in their cells at three prisoners of war houses around the country.

Mr Lustig told the Evening Standard: 'The prisoners never saw us and we never saw them. As soon as we noticed that something important was being discussed we cut a record. The records we kept of atrocities were given a special marking in red.

'We knew these things were happening. I was fortunate because all my closest family had got out of Germany.'

The evidence gathered by the refugees was not used in the Nuremberg trials however, because of fears that the methods used might have contravened the Geneva Convention.

All those hired had to sign the Official Secrets Act meaning they could not publicly discuss what they were doing or any of the information they heard.

The story of the Nazi eavesdroppers has been unveiled in a new book called The M Room: Secret Listeners Who Bugged The Nazis by Historian Helen Fry.

The honorary UCL research fellow trawled through 100,000 documents at the National Archives in Kew to dig out some of the transcripts recorded.

She told the newspaper one of the most horrifying pieces of evidence she found was General Dietrich von Choltitz - the former military governor of Paris.

He reportedly said: 'The worst job I ever carried out - which however I carried out with great consistency - was the liquidation of the Jews.' He then went on to describe how they were lined up in pit in the woods and shot and children were thrown in.

The revelations give a new insight into the tactics used by the British during the Second World War and the thoughts of the German officers who were involved in the Holocaust.
