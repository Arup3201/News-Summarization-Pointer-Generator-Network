Seven hours after a fire truck fell into a sinkhole on Sydney's northern beaches, a crane has removed it from from the collapsed road.

However, emergency services officers are still concerned about the safety of the 'unstable' roadway and up to 50 homes in the area are without water.

The fire truck was called out to attend a burst water main when at around 4.45am, it rounded a corner of The Serpentine at Bilgola Beach and section of the road imploded beneath it.

Three families were evacuated, five houses severely damaged and dozens of homes are now without water after the mains were turned off to prevent further flooding.

The emergency began at around 4.45am, four fire brigade officers were driving in the truck along The Serpentine at Bilgola Beach when it rounded a corner and the road beneath it collapsed.

Dangerous tilt: the fire truck, which has now been removed from the collapsed road at Bilgola Beach, was teetering on a 45 degree tilt fire officers said before it was stabilised and removed by crane

Damage: As a fire truck got trapped in the road above this house a landslide caused by burst water mains sent tonnes of mud cascading down the hill, causing damage to several houses  

The back left wheel of the 14 tonne truck slumped into a hole which opened up, causing the truck to teeter on the edge of the road.

Two mudslides streamed down causing damaging to five houses. Three families had to be evacuated.

'It was still pitch black and all hell broke loose. It was a harrowing experience for the guys,' NSW Fire Brigade Acting Superintendent Steve Moran told the MailOnline.

'It will be a delicate operation getting it out,' Mr Moran said, 'we just don't know how much of the road is unstable.'

Evacuated: Three families have been forced to leave their houses below the collapsed section of The Serpentine at Bilgola Beach where a sinkhole trapped the fire truck (above) causing it to collapse into the roadway

NSW Police said a large crane was required to pull out the truck, but 'that might prove too heavy for the road'.

The burst water main is believed to have caused the road collapse.

Sydney Water does not know what caused the burst main and has shut off the water supply. Police have closed off The Serpentine and are considering other road closures.
