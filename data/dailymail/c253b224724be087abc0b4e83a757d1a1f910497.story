After suffering relegation with Doncaster Rovers last season, David Cotterill was desperate to escape playing in Sky Bet League One.

Birmingham came to his rescue and the Welshman showed Championship class as he guided them to victory at Millwall.

Cotterill set up Clayton Donaldson for the opener, scored a memorable free-kick and then crossed for Wes Thomas to add a match-killing third late on after Millwall had threatened a comeback.

‘David has been our player of the season so far,’ said Birmingham manager Lee Clark. ‘Making chances for people, scoring and making chances for himself.’

Birmingham’s first win in nine lifted them to 19th and Clark’s relief was clear.

They were second best in the first half but took the lead when Cotterill squared for Donaldson to tap in from a yard out after 32 minutes.

And the winger excelled himself when his 35-yard free-kick looped and bounced to deceive goalkeeper David Forde.

Two free headers squandered at the climax of this attacking spell cost Millwall the game. Chaplow again delivered well from the right and Gregory directed his straight at the keeper.

And moments later, a Shaun Williams free-kick found Mark Beevers totally unchallenged, only for the defender to head straight at Randolph.

Birmingham weathered the storm and rediscovered their attacking verve in the final 10 minutes. There was a massive let-off when Cotterill’s shot was spilt by Forde to Donaldson, who sent the rebound over the bar.

But they weren’t so lucky on 84 minutes when Cotterill, capping a fine personal performance, crossed from the left for substitute Thomas to sew up the points.

It was the cue for a boos and a mass exodus from the home faithful who, like their manager, have plenty to be fretting over at the moment. 

‘I was lower than a snake’s belly on Saturday night (after losing to Fulham),’ Clark added. ‘But if we play like we can play, we’ll soon feel better about ourselves.’
