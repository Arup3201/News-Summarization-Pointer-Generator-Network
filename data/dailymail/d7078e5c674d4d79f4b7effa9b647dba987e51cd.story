So after all the tears and tantrums, we finally have a triumph.

‘Hey Monty, try winning in America,’ Phil Mickelson once teased him in a note left in his locker, after Colin Montgomerie was bitching about a tee-time with the journeymen at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

Well, now he has.

Let others churlishly remark that it was on the old men’s circuit that he finally achieved it, that he used to proclaim you would never find him playing seniors golf in a million years (Monty contradicting himself? Surely not!). Or that you can’t count the Senior USPGA Championship as a real major.

Silverware: Colin Montgomerie won the Senior PGA Championship in Michigan on Sunday

Special moment: Montgomerie finally won his first event in America at the 135th time of asking

Look down that illustrious leaderboard and you’ll understand why 50-year-old Monty will regard winning for the first time in America at the 135th time of asking on Sunday as one of the special moments of his career. In second place: Tom Watson. Third: Bernhard Langer. It doesn’t get much better, does it?

It’s less than a month since Langer was finishing in the top 10 at the Masters. He’s a runaway leader on the grandiosely titled Champions Tour. Yet Monty wiped the floor with him.

Did someone switch off that notorious temper once he reached 50? Did he finally realise you can’t pick a fight with American galleries and still win a major? 

Here was the Monty we always wanted to 
see at a United States Open or the other USPGA. He always had the 
talent, he had a  surplus of it. But here he added the  requisite calm 
as well.

Out in front: Montgomerie finished four shots clear of Tom Watson in Benton Harbor

Taunt: Phil Mickelson once joked about Montgomerie's inability to win in America

It’s almost 20 years since he contested a play-off for the US Open with Ernie Els in the boiling heat of Pittsburgh.

On the telly in the clubhouse, a cavalcade of police vehicles were on the Los Angeles highways in mad pursuit of the celebrated American footballer OJ Simpson, suspected (later controversially cleared) of murdering his wife, Nicole. It wasn’t long before Monty was giving vain chase to the Big Easy.

His face was so red he looked ready to explode. Not for the first or last time we thought: ‘How can he hope to win in such a rage?’

There were many other near misses, of course. None was more painful than 2006 at Winged Foot. One hole to go and my boss sent me an excited text: ‘He’s only going to go and finally do it, isn’t he?’ One double bogey later, and we had the painful riposte: ‘Sadly not.’

Drought: Monty never won one of golf's majors, coming agonisingly close at the US Open

‘I’ve got a full diary on Tuesday and it is going to be a bit strange going back to giving lessons after this.’ 

It’s back on the range at The Rayleigh in Essex for 30-year-old Mark Hooper after playing with US Open champion Justin Rose in the final round of the BMW PGA Championship. Hooper claimed his place in the field after winning the PGA’s East Region order of merit last year with season’s earnings of around £12,000. On Sunday, he finished a highly creditable 38th and won £24,000.

How lovely to see him so becalmed and for
 all the crucial putts to drop.

How delicious to see the golfing gods 
indulge in a little mischief on the 18th, as a rare wayward approach 
cannoned off the grandstand and back into the middle of the green.

It wouldn’t have mattered where it had bounced, he was so far ahead by that stage, but clearly the heavens had decided: there you go, Monty, there’s the luck we never gave you when you were raging at us and bemoaning your fortune.

This was the first time in 25 years that the Scot didn’t compete in the PGA Championship at Wentworth but there was still no ignoring him, even while the tournament was conjuring up its memorable finish. And now he’s bested Watson and Langer.

Major Montgomerie. That always did have a certain ring to it.

McIlroy and Scott set to dominate

Honestly, you wait ages for one of the world’s elite to win a tournament and then two come along at once. No sooner had Rory McIlroy won for the first time since declaring himself free and single again than Adam Scott was winning for the first time as a married man.

Scott’s impressive triumph in a play-off against USPGA champion Jason Dufner in Texas on Sunday came seven days after he achieved his lifetime goal of becoming world No 1 and meant he can enjoy it for a while longer.

Champion: Rory McIlory won the PGA Championship at Wentworth days after splitting from Caroline Wozniacki

How does it fit? Adam Scott won the Crowne Plaza Invitational after beating Jason Dufner in a play-off

But now he’s got the bit between his teeth again, what price McIlroy, back up to world No 6, chasing him down before the summer is out to reclaim top spot?

I’ve remarked before that, if everyone was playing their best golf, these two would be a half-step ahead. Let’s hope Sunday was a foretaste of things to come and this proves to be the summer when they develop a fully fledged friendly rivalry. 

And if they do, Rory will come out on top.
