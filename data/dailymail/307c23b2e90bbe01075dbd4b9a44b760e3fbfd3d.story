Jack Butland insists he is over his World Cup disappointment and believes the experience will help him realise his long-term ambition of becoming England No1.

The Stoke goalkeeper called up to Roy Hodgson’s squad for Euro 2012 after John Ruddy suffered a late injury and he made no secret that he wanted to force his way into the England head coach’s plans for this summer’s trip to Brazil.

At the European Championships in Israel 12 months ago, for instance, Butland had said that “Rio was on everybody’s minds” and repeated his aim last November.

Experience: Jack Butland says he is enjoying his time in Toulon, and is over the World Cup disappointment

Always learning: The youngster has been called up to the national team but was snubbed for the World Cup

Butland, however, only played four 
times for Stoke last season and was sent out on loan to Barnsley and 
Leeds, with his international commitments limited to eight appearances 
for the Under-21s in their Euro 2015 qualification campaign.

As
 a result, Butland, who will tonight captain the Under-20s against South
 Korea in their latest assignment at the Toulon Tournament, accepts he 
never gave Hodgson a serious decision to make about who would be 
England’s third keeper in Brazil.

‘Going
 to the World Cup would have been a fantastic experience,’ said Butland,
 who will go loan again next season if Asmir Begovic remains at Stoke. 
‘Not being a part of the World Cup has only given me more motivation and
 drive to push on and be a part of the next European Championships.

‘I
 can’t make a statement to myself if I’m not competing at the same level
 as the guys who have gone. Deep down I’m gutted not to be going to the 
World Cup as you always want to be part of major tournaments.

‘I
 can’t sit here, be frustrated or hold a grudge. If I was playing well 
in the Premier League then I could say “yeah, I can make a statement” 
but that hasn’t been the case. It’s a target (to progress) for next 
season.

‘But coming here
 has been beneficial. Facing top opposition will test us and help us if 
we want to win the Euros next summer. Playing against these sides here 
is massively important for our development. The players want to be 
accustomed to playing against the top sides.’

Representing: Butland was No 1 for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London

Losing
 to Brazil in Saint-Raphael on Monday means England must beat South 
Korea to stand a chance of qualifying for third-fourth place play-off 
and the 21-year-old is praying for a better result than the last time he
 faced the same opposition.

That
 was at the Olympic Games in 2012 and he was powerless to prevent South 
Korea winning a tense penalty shootout at the Millennium Stadium 5-4; 
the memory of failing to get near a single spot-kick still lingers.

‘The
 standard of the penalties they took was superb,’ Butland recalled. ‘I 
was devastated because it was a one-off competition. But you can’t dwell
 on disappointments for too long. We have got to make sure we clinch 
third-place here now.

‘It
 would be massive to come in the top four of this tournament. We want to
 be in the top four, no matter which tournament we play in. We want to 
be in the top two, we want to be in the top team. Those are the stages 
of tournaments we want to be regularly getting to in the future.’

Lack of opportunities: Butland has struggled at Stoke this season

IN SAFE HANDS… JACK BUTLAND ON HIS GOALKEEPING IDOLS

MANUEL
 NEUER (Bayern Munich and Germany) – It is his presence, he is a bit 
nuts as well and I think you need that. His shot stopping and 
distribution too has been very good with Pep Guardiola coming in. There 
has been a lot of pressure on him to play out from the back. He’s done 
it very well. As a presence and a shot stopper he has been phenomenal.

JOE
 HART (Manchester City and England) – When you have got the England No 1
 tag, it brings a lot more pressure and attention.  He has dealt with it
 fantastically in the time he has been England’s No 1 and Manchester 
City’s No 1. He has played incredibly. That is obviously the position I 
want to get to. When Joe is at his best, there aren’t many better.

ENGLAND U20 (4-2-3-1, probable): Butland; Dier, M Keane, Moore, Smith; Ward-Prowse, Chalobah; Redmond, Forster-Caskey, Obita; W Keane.

TV: LIVE on BT Sport 1 from 6.15pm (Kick-off 6.30pm).
