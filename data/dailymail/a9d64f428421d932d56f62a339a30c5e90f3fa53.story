Trendy winter coat manufacturer Canada Goose is being accused of being cruel to animals and covering up the truth about it, Daily Mail Online can disclose.

The hugely successful maker of fur-lined coats is the subject of legal action claiming that it has deliberately deceived consumers, exploited animal welfare concerns with disingenuous marketing and concealed the reality of chilling cruelty and animal suffering on which their multi-million dollar business is built.

The shocking allegations are made against the manufacturer in a legal complaint filed against the company last week in Canada.

The complaint has been filed by Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund and calls for independent law enforcement agency the Competition Bureau of Canada to 'investigate Canada Goose for its multiple intentional misrepresentations.'

Canada Goose has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket, coats and parkas. They have made America their new frontier, forging into the US clothing market with worldwide sales topping $176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade.

In November last year it opened its own store in West Chelsea, one of New York's most prestigious shopping areas, and it also sells at high-end stores such as Barney's, Bergdorf Goodman,, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus..

Earlier this year it opened a new factory in Toronto to cope with soaring demand. 

Celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur-trimmed, down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go-to label for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite.

Last year's Sports Illustrated cover featured Kate Upton wearing a Canada Goose jacket and little else. Other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included Hugh Jackman, the Wolverine star, and Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton.

It is endorsed by Ben Fogle, the British animal television show presenter, who has also spoken out against animal cruelty. 

But according to the legal complaint, seen by Daily Mail Online, consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase Canada Goose.

In the document Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund has accused the company of, 'engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur.'

The complaint attacks Canada Goose on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained.

Canada Goose's website claims that the company is 'deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals.'

It goes on, 'We never purchase fur from fur farms, never use fur from endangered animals, and only purchase from certified Canadian trappers.'

These trappers are governed by the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards (AIHTS) and their pelts are purchased by Canada Goose through North American Fur Auctions (NAFA).

According to Canada Goose the NAFA 'monitors very closely' the practices of the trappers selling through it.

According to Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund it does nothing of the sort. Instead, they claim: 'There is no mechanism within the NAFA to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which NAFA accepts consignment pelts.'

NAFA, it states, does not monitor trappers. It is not an oversight body; it is a commercial fur auction house.

Nor does the AIHTS bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in Canada Goose's claims. The AIHTS simply requires Canada to 'phase out' certain types of traps – traps, Animal Justice Canada claims, that are still used by the trappers selling to Canada Goose.

What Canada Goose says: The FAQs on the firm's website form part of the animal rights group's case against the successful manufacturer. They say that the trappers are not monitored to be sure that act humanely

And so while consumers believe every effort is being made to ensure that the fur they are wearing when they buy a Canada Goose coat has been secured with minimal animal suffering and maximum human oversight, they are, Animal Justice Canada insists, being deceived.

Coyotes are caught in leg hold traps that inflict injuries including fractures, severance of tendons and ligaments, severe bleeding, spinal cord injury, organ damage and amputation of limbs. Despite these horrific injuries the animal may survive long enough to be clubbed, suffocated or strangled to death by the trapper.To dispatch an animal swiftly with a bullet would spoil the pelt.

Body gripping traps and snares - metal nooses - are also used inflicting similar injury and failing to deliver the swift 'humane' death implied in Canada Goose's marketing material.

The Fur Institute of Canada, which promotes the interests of the fur industry, believes a 'humane' death is on that occurs within 300 seconds. According to Animal Justice Canada: '..under laboratory conditions, it takes approximately eight minutes … for a snare to strangle a coyote – three minutes longer than what even the fur industry itself claims to be humane.'

As for the company's assertion that they do not use the pelt of endangered species, Animal Justice Canada points out that the traps set for coyotes are indiscriminate in the animals they capture.

Key among Canada Goose's defense of their use of real fur is their insistence that in, 'the coldest places on Earth…fur is not just the best choice, but the only choice.'

Speaking on their website, Danny Reis, the president and CEO of Canada Goose, explains: 'We use coyote fur for a number of reasons. Number one, coyote fur works. It's functional; it provides warmth around the face in a way that no synthetic fabric can. It does that in the coldest environments in earth, and it's important to realize that sometimes urban centers and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth.'

We're confident in both why we use fur and how it is sourced, and people should know this is not something we take lightly. 

Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry.

Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that.

We also understand that despite the fact that numerous brands also use real fur in their products and do not attempt to explain their position, it is our very openness and transparency around this subject that makes Canada Goose a target for activist groups whose views will never align with ours.

We are proud to support an industry practice that supports northern and rural communities in Canada, and of our continued role as an educator on this matter.

The narrator then states: 'Coyote fur, unlike fake fur, doesn't hold moisture, retains heat and is biodegradable.'

In its legal complaint Animal Justice Canada says: 'There is no scientific proof to support Canada Goose's claim that coyote fur is more protective of the face, in a way that 'no synthetic material' can be.'

This is not the first time Canada Goose has fallen foul of animal rights campaigners.

Last year Daily Mail Online revealed that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was calling for the company to stop using coyote fur and to stop supporting the trapping of animals, 'in a way that is inherently cruel.'

Speaking to Daily Mail Online then Lindsay Rajt, Director of Campaigns for PETA described the horrific reality of animal trapping.

She said: 'The company's reference to AIHTS standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns.

'Leg hold traps are still legal in Canada. Mothers will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young. The trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper finds them. They are frightened and starving and in pain during that time. And then they're bludgeoned or strangled to death.'

Additionally PETA has called for the company to replace its goose down – which is obtained as a by-product of the poultry industry - and opt for 'revolutionary synthetic technology' already used by competitor, North Face.

But according to Ms Rajt PETA's repeated attempts to meet with Canada Goose have been stonewalled.

Now, Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund, has called for the Competition Bureau to investigate the company for its 'multiple intentional misrepresentations on its website.' And it has urged the body to 'take all appropriate enforcement action to ensure that Canada Goose is accountable' for the 'false and misleading information that it has willfully directed at consumers.'

Canada Goose said that it rejected any claims it had misinformed customers but said it could never satisfy activists entirely opposed to fur.

A spokesman said: 'Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry.

'Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that.'
