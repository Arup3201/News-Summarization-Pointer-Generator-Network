College students who interned at Taco Bell in the mid-Nineties are the latest contenders to come forward as the 'true' inventors of Doritos taco. 

Andrea Watt, Mark Rader and Roy Brown were part of a summer internship at Taco Bell in 1995 when they struck on the genius move of making a taco shell from Doritos' chips.

The group pitched the idea to Taco Bell executives as part of a competition for a line of Taco Bell-themed appetizers - and lost.

The Taco Bell college interns revealed promotional materials which they claim proves they are the original inventors of the Doritos-wrapped taco

Tasty profits: Since Taco Bell launched the Doritos Locos Tacos in 2012, it has made more than a $1billion in sales

Mr Brown told ABC that he didn't remember a 'very dramatic, positive reaction' to their idea.

Fast forward 15 years and the interns 'idea' has become Taco Bell's golden ticket. The Doritos Locos taco - which has a spicy, cool ranch or nacho cheese shell - has made $1billion for parent company of the two products, PepsiCo, since the snack launched in 2012.

The former interns are not looking for any money for the idea - just some recognition that they were behind the wildly popular snack.

Mrs Watt, a former Vanderbilt student in Nashville, still has the interns' marketing materials for the Doritos tacos as proof.

She told the Huffington Post: 'I’m sure I signed away that anything I 
pitched to them was their property anyway. I would just 
like someone to recognize that it was a good idea.'

None of the former interns went on to work in the food industry. Mr Brown works as a TV writer in California, Mr Rader is an advertising copywriter and Mrs Watts is in corporate sales training.

In a statement today, Taco Bell told MailOnline: 'From interns to inmates, we’ve had
no shortage of people claiming to have thought of the ''idea'' of a Doritos
flavored taco... The
reality is far more boring - the Doritos Locos Tacos that our fans love were
conceived, developed, and successfully brought to market by a hard-working,
collaborative team at Frito-Lay and Taco Bell.'

The former interns are not the first to claim they came up with the Doritos taco. 

Last year, friends of Todd Mills, who passed away from cancer at Thanksgiving, petitioned Taco Bell  after they claimed he came up with the idea but never made a cent.

Mr Mills reportedly had the brainwave for the Doritos Tacos Locos while watching TV in 2009 and lobbied the company and Taco Bell for two years with a Facebook campaign until it became a reality.

Taco Bell told MailOnline last year that their 'hearts are with his family' but added that Mr Mills 'did not invent' the snack.

Last May, an inmate at a maximum-security prison sued Taco Bell claiming the company stole his idea for the Doritos Loco Tacos.

Colorado prisoner Gary Cole, who is serving 25-year sentence for a number of charges, says the restaurant chain obtained the plans from him and stole his ideas. The lawsuit was later dismissed.
