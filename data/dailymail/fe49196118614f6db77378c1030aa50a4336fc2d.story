Sick: Moors murderer Ian Brady, pictured in 2001, may be well enough to appear before a mental health tribunal next week

Ian Brady is likely to be fit enough next week to appear in public for the first time in almost five decades, despite breaking two bones in his back.

The Moors Murderer suffered a seizure on Monday while speaking to his lawyer about his bid to starve himself to death.

The fall caused Brady, 74, who suffers a degenerative spine condition, to fracture two vertebrae.

He was transferred from the secure Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, to the University Hospital Aintree, six miles away.

Brady spent two nights in a private room before being driven back to Ashworth yesterday.

At a mental health tribunal next week, he is due to make his first public appearance since 1966 when he was convicted with Myra Hindley of murdering five children.

Brady, who has been tube-fed since starting a hunger strike 12 years ago, wants to be declared sane and allowed to die in prison.

Throughout his stay at the University 
Hospital Aintree he was kept under guard in a private room with two 
staff from Ashworth keeping watch along with officers from Merseyside 
Police.

Hospital staff told of seeing the killer being smuggled in covered by a blanket as armed police stood by.

But there was anger that the 
74-year-old, who along with partner Myra Hindley murdered five children 
in the 1960s, was getting treatment from the NHS at all.

Katherine Reece, 41, who was admitted 
to the same hospital with respiratory problems, said she had to wait 
five hours for aid while medics swarmed around Brady.

‘He has chosen to live like that so 
why should they look after him?’ she said. ‘The money they are spending 
on him is disgraceful.

‘He should be left to rot.’

Treatment: Brady was taken to Aintree University Hospital, in Fazakerley, Liverpool where he was treated in a private room

Killers: Brady and his partner, Myra Hindley, were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s

Katie Wilson, 20, who was visiting her
grandmother at the hospital, added: ‘He’s an evil man and he doesn’t 
even want to be alive, so why should he get looked after here?’

Hospital staff are understood to have 
used underground service tunnels to move Brady inside buildings so he 
wouldn’t be seen by patients. One employee said: ‘I came face to face 
with him and looked him in the eye – he looked really shrivelled, all 
wrapped up in a blanket in a wheelchair.’

By a tragic irony, the mother of the 
only victim of the Moors Murderers whose body has yet to be found is 
herself seriously ill in hospital suffering from cancer.

Winnie Johnson, who has campaigned for
Brady to reveal where he buried her 12-year-old son Keith Bennett’s 
body, had hoped to come face to face with him at next week’s tribunal 
hearing.

But the 78-year-old has accepted that given her health, to do so would be ‘too traumatic’, her solicitor said yesterday.

Guard: Police outside the Liverpool hospital where Brady was treated

Brady has been held at Ashworth secure
hospital in Maghull, Merseyside since 1985 from where next week’s 
hearing was due to be relayed to a courtroom in Manchester by video.

The Glasgow-born killer suffered a seizure on Monday afternoon while discussing his case with his solicitor, Richard Nicholas.

He was taken by ambulance to 
University Hospital Aintree and placed in a private room accompanied by 
two Ashworth nurses with guards outside the door.

Officially he was last night being kept in for tests as a precaution.

Brady is known to be in poor health after more than a decade subsisting only on liquid nutrition.

He suffers from a number of physical conditions and is thought to be on a respirator for breathing problems.

His solicitor said Brady would be keen to return to Ashworth for the tribunal to go ahead.

‘He’s looking forward to it, but at this stage we just don’t know if it will go ahead next week,’ Mr Nicholas said.

A spokesman for Ashworth said Brady had become ‘acutely physically unwell’ on the ward before being transferred to Aintree.

Neither hospital would comment on 
Brady’s condition but Jackie Powell, his mental health advocate, 
described him as ‘quite unwell’.

Brady – a prolific letter-writer – did not report any health problems in a note he sent a few days to journalist Peter Gould.

‘There was nothing to indicate he was 
experiencing health problems, other than a complaint about his 
eyesight,’ he said last night.

Brady and Hindley lured five children 
from streets around Manchester in the Sixties, sexually tortured them 
then buried their bodies on Saddleworth Moor.

Pauline Reade, 16, and John Kilbride, 
12, were both snatched in 1963, with Keith Bennett and Lesley Ann 
Downey, ten, killed the following year and 17-year-old Edward Evans in 
1965.

Victims: Pauline Reade, 16, left,  disappeared on her way to a disco, while Keith Bennett, 12, right, was snatched and murdered in 1964 after he 
left home to visit his grandmother but his body has never been found

Brady was jailed for life in 1966 for 
the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward, as was Hindley after being 
convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward.

It was not until 1987 that the pair finally admitted killing Keith and Pauline. Hindley died in jail in November 2002, aged 60.

Alan West, 75, stepfather of Lesley 
Ann Downey, had said before Brady's discharge: ‘I’m just hoping that 
whatever’s wrong with him, he doesn’t come out of hospital alive.’
