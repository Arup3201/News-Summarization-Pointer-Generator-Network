A contrite Chris Christie today used his State of the State address in Trenton to promise to co-operate with investigators who want to know why his aides plotted to exact revenge on a Democratic mayor by snarling traffic in his town.

'The last week has certainly tested this Administration,' he admitted to a joint session of New Jersey's General Assembly and Senate. 'Mistakes were clearly made. And as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve.'

'I know our citizens deserve better. Much better,' he said. 'I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch – both good and bad.

Head of state: Christie said today that 'I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad'

The law breathing down his neck: the Bridgegate scandal is lapping at the Governor's door with possible criminal prosecutions ahead

Moving on... Christie devoted just a minute of the 45-minute speech, at the Statehouse in Trenton, to the scandal before going on to crow about his achievements in New Jersey

'Without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again.

'But I also want to assure the people of New Jersey today that what has occurred does not define us or our state. ... I am the leader of this state and its people and I stand here today proud to be both. And always determined to do better.'

Still, Christie only spent a minute addressing what has been his latest claim to infamy. The text comprised less than a quarter-page of the seven-page speech.

The balance of his presentation touted his successes – including a falling unemployment rate, pension reform and his refusal to raise taxes.

But Christie's pats on his own back only go so far with observers.

Democratic lobbyists milling around the New Jersey state capitol building were predicting a tough day or, as one put it, 'a bridge to nowhere' for Christie.

Chrstie then moved on to focus on his successes as a governor. But the lobbyist said 'the whole day will be about [the bridge] anyway.'

The sudden closure of three bridge on-ramp lanes backed up traffic throughout the New Jersey town of Fort Lee for four days in September, trapping children in school buses and angering commuters whose trip into New York City was lengthened by an hour or more.

'We let you down': Christie again said he was sorry for denting public trust but said 'what has occurred will not define us'

and former Campaign Manager Bill Stepien (R, looking at Christie) were 
shown the door on Wednesday and will likely see subpoenas this week. 
Democrats in Trenton believe a third aide may well soon be dragged into 
the crisis

Christie, the famously in-your-face Republican chief executive has already cleaned house, firing a deputy chief of staff and dismissing a long-time political aide who ran his 2013 re-election campaign.

But a second Democratic staffer walking the Trenton capitol's halls told MailOnline that the scandal will reach even higher in the Christie administration, and that Kevin O'Dowd, the governor's chief of staff while the bridge scheme was in place, could find himself behind the eight-ball next.

'There's just no way his chief of staff didn't know this was going on,' the political veteran said. 'Christie runs his office like he ran his U.S. Attorney's office. And it's always "Do as I say, not as I do."'

'Christie has his entire senior staff in his office for a meeting once a week,' he explained. 'He gathers his staff, he gives marching orders, and when the meeting's over every in the room knows everything that's going on.'

'You're telling me this never came up? No way.'

Even
 if O'Dowd was unaware, sources tell MailOnline, he faces a rocky road 
ahead since Christie has nominated him to serve as the Garden State's 
next attorney general.

A 
state assembly Senate Democratic aide told MailOnline Tuesday morning 
that his confirmation hearing is being delayed because legislators on a 
hastily assembled super committee organized to address the bridge 
scandal don't know if they will issue a subpoena.

If
 O'Dowd were attorney general when a subpoena went out, he would be 
responsible for enforcing it against himself, and for prosecuting 
himself if he refused. The result could create a constitutional crisis 
in the state.

'It's open season,' an aide in the capitol confided.

David Wildstein refused to testify before Assemblyman John Wisniewski's transportation committee on Jan. 9, citing his Fifth Amendment rights, but assembly democrats voted to hold him in contempt -- and now Wisniewski has asked a prosecutor to charge him with a crime

John
 Wisniewski, the liberal state assemblyman leading the charge against 
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the wake of his George Washington 
Bridge traffic scandal, announced Monday that he has formed a new 
special investigative committee to issue subpoenas and press for more 
answers.

A Rasmussen poll of
 New Jerseyans released Monday found that 54 per cent believe it's 
'likely' that Christie knew about the plot to close the bridge lanes 
when it happened. Only 17 per cent said it was 'not at all likely.'

In
 the meantime, acting Attorney General John Hoffman remains in place, 
perhaps permanently. Regina Egea, a Christie aide responsible for 
overseeing the state 'authorities unit,' recently moved up to the chief 
of staff role, she has been promised.

Among
 the government agencies Egea's long-time department manages is the Port
 Authority, which saw two of its officials resign in December after they
 were implicated in the bridge matter.

Egea
 was also the first Christie staffer to receive an email about the chaos
 the September lane closures created, and was warned that the result 
could be dangerous to the public.

Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful internal email on August 13, subpoenaed documents show

Subpoenaed records released by state assembly Democrats on Friday show that Bill Baroni, the Port Authority's then-deputy director and a Christie appointee, forwarded a message to Egea just hours after three lanes on the bridge were closed off to local traffic, saying that the move created 'dangers to the public interest.'

A contrite Christie apologized for the scandal Thursday in a marathon press conference, but maintained that he had no knowledge of the scheme that had already brought the December resignations of Baroni and David Wildstein, the Port Authority official who supervised what he would later call a 'traffic study.'

The governor claimed during Thursday's press event that he had no relationship with Wildstein and could not recall having conversations with him.

'I have had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election,' Christie said. 'You know, I could probably count on one hand the number of conversations I’ve had with David since he worked at the Port Authority. I did not interact with David.'

On Tuesday The Wall Street Journal published photographs of the two chatting during the Sept. 11 memorial ceremonies – on the third day of the bridge lane closures. It's not known what they discussed.

The governor's presumed aspirations to be the next President of the United States are in jeopardy as the scandal has energized New Jersey Democrats who are determined to torpedo their governor.
