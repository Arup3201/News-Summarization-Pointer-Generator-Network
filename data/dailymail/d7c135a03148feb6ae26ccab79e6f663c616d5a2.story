Owen Beddall knows he's no supermodel but he didn't think that would be an issue when he was being interviewed on TV as an author for his recently released book.

So it came as a rude shock for the Sydney-sider when he was turned down by a number of shows in Los Angeles because he didn't have 'the Hollywood look'.

The author of Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley was told by U.S. producers that he needed to lose 45kg and further suggested that he sign up for reality weight-loss series The Biggest Loser.

But the 38-year-old was then told he couldn't feature on the American version of the show as it would be difficult for the American audience to understand him as he doesn't speak 'proper English'.

Owen Beddall worked for Qantas from 2001 to 2013. He is now the author of Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley

Beddall began his five-week international book tour in July for his tell all-memoir, which documents his 12 years attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant.

He told Daily Mail Australia that he always knew he would write a book about his high-flying experiences.

The 38-year-old began writing the book in 2011 after he broke his back

'I wanted to keep note of the funny things because flight attending isn't your average job,' he said.

But it wasn't until Beddall became paralysed after breaking his back when he slipped down some stairs in 2011 that he put his plan into action.

'Those moments were dark for me as I was in hospital for two months and had to learn to walk again,' he said.

'So I wrote the book as a cathartic experience and it really helped.'

While his road to recovery continues, Beddall says his medication and physical restrictions has resulted in his 30kg weight gain.

Beddall, who already felt uncomfortable about his body, didn't think he would face scrutiny on his appearance whilst on a book tour.

'My agent had sent over some TV reels to the LA producers who then cancelled my interviews,' he said.

'I couldn't understand why and then was told that the producers said that I should lose 100 pounds then come back.

'It was so ridiculous because I was being held to the same standards as Kate Moss and Miranda Kerr.

'I thought as an author I would be judged on my intelligence and not for being a Victoria's Secret model.

'It really made me think that LA really is the heartland of stupidity.'

It was then suggested that he apply for The Biggest Loser in the U.S.

'But then when we looked into it I was told that I spoke too fast, my humour was too bitchy and that I don't speak proper English so it would be hard for the American audience to understand what I'm saying,' he said.

Beddall says his tour was an eye-opener and taught him to be 'thick-skinned'.

'I also think its important to make the point that men are equally scrutinised and criticised about their weight even if it isn't as openly discussed,' he said.

Beddall's book highlights incidents such as being on a flight with Olympic gold medalist Grant Hackett who badly affected by Stilnox on a flight.

He also met comedian Russell Brand and singer Katy Perry as they returned from their 'first date' in Phuket.Â  He said Perry was so down to earth she could have been any other passenger.

He further recounted the moment British singer Lily Allen was 's***faced' from booze whilst he was on duty.

The author has already started on his second book and looking creating his first into a film.
