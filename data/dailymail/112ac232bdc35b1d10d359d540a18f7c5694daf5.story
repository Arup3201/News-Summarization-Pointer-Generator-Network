Manchester United vs Newcastle United (Old Trafford) 

Team news

Manchester United

Defender Chris Smalling is making a good recovery from his groin injury and could play in Manchester United's Boxing Day match against Newcastle.

Midfielders Ander Herrera (muscle injury), Marouane Fellaini (illness) and Daley Blind (knee) are out.

Louis van Gaal will again be without Luke Shaw and Daley Blind while Marcos Rojo is also a doubt

Left-back Luke Shaw (ankle) is also unavailable and Marcos Rojo is a major doubt because of the thigh injury that has sidelined him for the last two matches.

Provisional squad: De Gea, Lindegaard, Amos, Vermijl, Blackett, Rojo, Thorpe, Smalling, Evans, Jones, McNair, Rafael, Pereira, Fletcher, Valencia, Lingard, Anderson, Carrick, Young, Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj, Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie, W Keane.

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will be without midfield enforcer Cheick Tiote through suspension for the trip to Old Trafford.

The Ivory Coast international picked up his fifth booking of the season during Sunday's 1-0 defeat by Sunderland and will sit out along with goalkeeper Tim Krul, who is a week ahead of schedule in his recovery from an ankle injury, but like number two Rob Elliot (thigh), still has some way to go.

Striker Papiss Cisse continues to battle the after-effects of knee surgery and a virus, while midfielders Mehdi Abeid (toe) and Siem de Jong (thigh) are back in training but unavailable for the game at Old Trafford, and Rolando Aarons (hamstring), Gabriel Obertan (thigh) and Ryan Taylor (knee) remain on the sidelines.

Provisional squad: Alnwick, Woodman, Janmaat, Dummett, S. Taylor, Williamson, Coloccini, Streete, Haidara, Anita, Sissoko, Cabella, Colback, Gouffran, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong.
