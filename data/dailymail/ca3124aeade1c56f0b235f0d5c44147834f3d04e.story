A 10-year-old boy was among at least 13 casualties of a US-led raid late Friday that ended with the death of an American photojournalist held captive by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Special operations commandos sent to rescue Luke Somers, 33, in the village of Dafaar in Yemen became bogged down in a firefight and were unable to reach him before he was shot and killed by his captors.

Another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by captors in the midst of the raid, US officials said.

The list of casualties included a woman, an AQAP commander and two militants, as well as six members from their tribe, according to other militants' social media feeds.

The commander, Jamal Mubarak al-Hardal-Daghari al-Awlaki, appeared to be the same person as Mubarakal-Harad, named in a Yemen Defence Ministry statement on Saturday as the leader of an AQAP faction.

Several of those killed were reported to be from the Daghari and Awlaki families, important tribes in Shabwa
province. 

The hostages were
being held in the house of a man named Saeed al-Daghari, according to a statement from the Yemeni government  on Saturday.

SEAL officers came as close as 100 yards from the building where the hostages were being held, before becoming embroiled in a firefight with AQAP militants.

As special forces fought off the attack, kidnappers in the home where the two hostages were being held shot and killed them, according a local identifying himself as Jamal.

Killed: South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by his captors, adding to the list of at least 13 killed during the raid

Held hostage: Somers had been held by extremist militants since September 2013 and pleaded for his life in a video released by his captors

Kidnapped: Somers was taken from Sana'a, Yemen's capital, and brought to Dafaar, a village in the Shabwa province to the south

Ministry of Defense: Yemen's government and local residents said Yemeni forces participated in the raid, though US officials claim the raid was carried out by American forces alone

US officials have said the raid was carried out by U.S. forces alone, but both 

Yemen's government and local residents said Yemeni forces participated in the raid, though US officials claim the raid was carried out by American forces alone.

'Before the gunshots were heard, very strong floodlights
turned the night into daylight, and then we heard loud
explosions,' Jamal told Reuters. 

'The soldiers were calling on
the house's inhabitants to surrender and the speaker was clearly
a Yemeni soldier,' he added.

Another witness, named Abdullah, said the Yemeni army had
blocked access to the Wadi from all directions before the raid
began.

'When the forces withdrew, we found lots of bloodstains, but
did not know if those were of the soldiers or the hostages,' Abdullah said. 

For the South African Korkie, the raid came just before his expected release on Sunday, according to the Gift of the Givers relief group, which had negotiated for his freedom.

The South African government said it had undertaken 'numerous initiatives' to help free Korkie. His body was expected in South Africa on Monday. 

Yemeni journalist Abdel-Razaq al-Jamal said AQAP may have originally intended to ransom Somers as well, but was likely angered by the earlier rescue attempt in November.

US Secretary of State John Kerry said the second operation had only been approved
because of information that the American's life was in imminent
danger. 

AQAP, formed in 2006 by the merger of the Yemeni and Saudi
branches of the network, has for years been seen by Washington
as one of the movement's most dangerous branches. 

At least one British hostage and a Turkish man are currently being held by the group.
