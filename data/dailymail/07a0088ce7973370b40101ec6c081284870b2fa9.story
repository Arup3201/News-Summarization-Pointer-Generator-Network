AEL Limassol manager Ivaylo Petev has warned Tottenham they will not have it easy in their Europa League play-off in Cyprus.

Mauricio Pochettino's side get their European campaign under way on the Mediterranean island on Thursday as they look to make it through to the group stages for the fourth year in a row.

Spurs are overwhelming favourites to progress against AEL, with bookmakers pricing the Cypriot league runners-up as 15/2 to win at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca.

Warning message: AEL Limassol manager Ivaylo Petev believes his side are fully prepared for the Spurs match

Buoyant mood: Petev will be hoping he is smiling after AEL Limassol's match against Tottenham on Thursday

They are odds that will no doubt amuse their manager Petev, especially given they started this campaign with a 1-0 home win against a Zenit St Petersburg side managed by former Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas.

The Russians eventually progressed from the Champions League third qualifying round encounter 3-1 on aggregate, but their home performance has buoyed the Cypriots.

'I believe August 21 will be a very good day for AEL,' Petev told www.uefa.com. 'There is belief and it is vital that there is in the squad.

'We managed to beat a club like Zenit in our previous tie in Europe and were then unlucky to go out against them because we played with 10 men for some 70 minutes [in the second leg]. But that is now behind us.'

Winning run: Tottenham will be hoping they can follow up their victory against West Ham by beating AEL

Leading the way: Manager Mauricio Pochettino will be taking control of his first European match at his new club
