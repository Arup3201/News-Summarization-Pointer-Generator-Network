A new Google tool has been installed on the search engine site which allows users to compare different foods - right down to their nutritional information.

The tool is designed so that if a user type in two types of food, with the word 'vs' in between, or the two foods with the word 'compare' preceding it, they will see a chart revealing the foods make up, comparing them side by side.

The tool even measures the different foods based on how they are prepared and what is in them, as well as portion size.

The tool appears automatically when you type in two foods with the word 'vs' in between them, and displays the most relevant nutritional information available in a comparison

For example, typing in 'sweet potato mash vs mashed potato' will show you that sweet potatoes have 4.2 grams of sugar per 100 grams and mashed potatoes have just 0.5 grams for the same portion.

But scroll down and you can see that sweet potato mash beats mashed potatoes in the amount of potassium, calcium content and vitamin A they have.

A drop down menu allows you to change portion or preparation methods or additions to see how this changes the fat or sugar content.

If you changed the method of making mashed potatoes to 'potato, mashed with milk and margarine' the fat content will rise to 4.7 grams, whereas if you change it to 'mashed with milk and butter' it rises again to 5 grams of fat.

The tool can even be used for bizarre combinations of different food groups, such as 'bacon vs grape'

The tool can be used to compare anything, from 'pizza vs pie' to 'apple vs grape'.

Even concordant foods from different food groups can be compared, such as 'bacon vs grape', for those concocting strange food combinations, or for those who are just curious.

The tool is made with nutritional information taken from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and was installed after the success of Google's original nutrition search tool that was released in May 2013, according to Google spokeswoman Krisztina Radosavljevic-Szilagyi.

In an interview with NPR Ms Radosavljevic-Szilagyi said: 'We noticed that people were doing a lot of food and nutrition searches â€” multi-step searches on one food and another food.

'These things are often compared to one another, so we thought, why don't we make it easy?'

Some foods have far more information than others, and many comparisons reveal how much artificial ingredients some foods have

The nutritional information was gathered by Google from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the tool was quietly installed on at the end of last year after the success of their original nutritional information tool

Ms Radosavljevic-Szilagyi added that Google's algorithm is always calculating 'what might be useful to you when you ask a question'.

She said: 'There are plenty more complicated food, recipe and nutrition questions 
to help people answer. We want to give as many answers to as many 
complicated questions as possible.'

The tool was developed and quietly installed at the end of 2013, and was shortly followed by another tool that lets users access restaurant menus much quicker.

For the second tool they have already accessed menus of 75 per cent of the restaurants in the U.S.

The tool, which is activated from typing directly into the Google search bar, also works in conjunction with Wikipedia and IMDB facts to compare other things, like movies, except the data will be used to compare directors, budget and earnings.
