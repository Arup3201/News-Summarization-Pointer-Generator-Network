Tom Heaton bailed out Burnley with a rare penalty save against Southampton and then backed one of the Premier League relegation favourites to rescue themselves from the drop.

The former Manchester United goalkeeper brilliantly turned away an effort from Dusan Tadic, who became the first Saints player to fail from the spot in the Premier League in 30 attempts stretching back more than 17 years.

Burnley, who appeared to be doomed a month ago, took full advantage as a deflected winner from Ashley Barnes lifted them out of the relegation zone.

29 - Dusan Tadic’s miss ended a run of 29 consecutive Premier League penalties scored by Southampton. 

Sean Dyche’s team have now picked up 11 points from the last six games, and Heaton insists they have the belief to survive in the top-flight.

‘Obviously staying in the league is going to be success for us and we feel that we’ve got a great chance of being successful,’ he said. ‘We think it’s a great challenge, a great opportunity for us.

‘To be honest, we always felt we were not far off. Even when we didn’t win for the first 10 games we had the belief to turn things around. Once we got one it sort of opened the floodgates and gave us a bit of freedom. We’ve got back to what we’re all about.’

While Burnley are on the rise, Southampton’s season has suddenly gone in the opposite direction. This was their fourth defeat in a row after losing to Arsenal and both Manchester clubs, even though Ronald Koeman’s team stay in fifth.

The Dutchman will be looking for an immediate reaction from his team when they play at Sheffield United on Tuesday in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup.

‘It will be a massive occasion,’ said midfielder James Ward-Prowse. ‘We are desperate to turn around the run we are on at the moment and get back to winning ways, and I don’t think there is any better opportunity than the quarter-final of the cup.’
