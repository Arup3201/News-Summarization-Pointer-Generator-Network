Thorbjorn Olesen sealed his second career European Tour title on Sunday with a final-round 71 to see off the challenge of Victor Dubuisson at the Perth International.

The 24-year-old Dane took a three-shot lead into the final day at Lake Karrinyup Country Club, and eventually held on to win by as many strokes from Dubuisson.

The Frenchman signed for a closing 66 to finish in outright second after a bogey-free round that featured six birdies.

Olesen was one over through 12 holes, but birdied the 13th and 15th to regain a commanding lead and eventually finish at 17 under.

The win marked Olesen's second title on the European circuit after his maiden breakthrough at the Sicilian Open in April 2012.

'It was tough - they were not easy conditions today,' the world number 130 said on www.europeantour.com.

'I missed a few short putts today in the middle of the round and I think that the lead got down to one shot, but I was just thinking about getting my round back to under par, keeping focused, and seeing if I could make a few birdies coming in.

Dubuisson's final round of 66 was not enough to catch winner Olesen as he settled for second place

'It was a tough day but it was worth it - that walk down 18 was beautiful.

'My driving and a couple of three woods were off line, which made it tricky, but I made some great putts coming in.

'It's been a couple of years since I won last time, so this gives me a lot of confidence and belief for the last bit of the season.'

Mark Foster claimed third place on 12 under after a 69, one shot ahead of a group of five tied for fourth - fellow Englishman James Morrison (73), Scot David Drysdale (71), Dane Lucas Bjerregaard (70), American Steve Dartnall (70) and Australian Matthew Griffin (67).

Morrison bogeyed the 18th to lose outright fourth place.

South Africa's Charl Schwartzel could not launch a late challenge, shooting a level-par 72 to finish his week at nine under overall in a tie for 15th.

It was a final round to forget for Scotland's Scott Jamieson as he strung together three consecutive double-bogeys from holes two through four before throwing in another five bogeys to post an 81.
