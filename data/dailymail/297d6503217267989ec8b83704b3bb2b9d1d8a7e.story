Petty criminals were once held in chains within its walls before being sent to waiting prison ships docked on the banks of the River Thames and shipped to the colonies.

Today, the 18th century former courthouse lying in the heart of old Chelsea, tucked away behind Cheyne Walk, is no longer a place fit for doomed footpads ,but a stunning £14.5million home.

But if you're not sure whether you want to shackle yourself to the historic building - the only surviving local courthouse-jail in the capital - you can try before you buy for the sum of £10,000 a week.

The Court House in Justice Walk, at the heart of old Chelsea in London is today on the market for £14.5million. The stunning restoration boasts seven en-suite bedrooms, as well as two additional family bathrooms

The property was built in the 18th century, at a time when Chelsea was transformed into a prosperous town across the River Thames from the city of London

Leading London property agents say more and more sellers are putting their properties on both the sales and lettings markets.

Many are happy to let potential buyers let a property before deciding if they want to buy.

Mark Tunstall, of 'ultra prime' specialists Tunstall Property London, said: 'The practice of 'try before you buy' is more prevalent with overseas purchasers who often look to rent a property before committing to a major financial investment.

'Someone from overseas, who is unfamiliar with areas of London and how London is as a city, often has a number of friends living in different neighbourhoods, each feeding back differing opinions on areas such as Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Kensington, Chelsea, Marylebone and so on.

'However, it is impossible to really get a feeling for an area without living or visiting there for a period of time and this, coupled with the increase in stamp duty which has made buying a property even more expensive, often leads overseas buyers to first rent a property to get to know a certain area, location or development before committing to a substantial investment in their property of choice.'

Now the courthouse has now been restored from one of the oldest local courthouses in London, into a luxurious seven bedroom family retreat, available for rent at £10,000 per week or to buy for £14.5 million

The main house boasts five bedroom suites, each with en-suite bathrooms, as well as luxurious floor to ceiling wardrobes and full height bespoke doors. The grand master bedroom occupies the entire top floor, serviced by his and hers luxurious en-suite bathrooms, walk in wardrobes and private studies surmounted by vast skylights and partitioning doors

Legend has it a secret underground passage is located underneath The Court House, which was used to transport the old Court's most dangerous convicts to the prison ships moored on the nearby banks of the River Thames

'In one particular instance I re-housed a young banker three times, each time in an increasingly expensive home. On the third occasion, having paid a year's rent of over £400,000 in advance (£8,500 per week) for an ultra-cool pad apartment in Knightsbridge, a stone's throw from Harrods, he decided within three days of moving in that he loved the house so much he'd like to buy it, so we approached the landlord and 4 weeks later we completed the purchase for just over £10 million.' 

In the 18th Century, Justice Walk gained its name, as it was a place where prisoners, many charged for similar crimes to the legendary highwayman Dick Turpin, were tried. Those found guilty were subsequently taken on the short walk down to prison ships, waiting to transport them to one of Britain's Penal Colonies.

Developed in the 18th Century, The Court House, which is being sold through agents Russell Simpson, is no longer the final place for petty criminals, but a lavish home that encapsulates the feeling of being in an oriental woodland retreat, giving the occupiers a sense of calm in one of the world's busiest cities.

The home also features a secluded walled garden, which connects the main house with a guesthouse

What was once the courtroom jail, has been transformed into a family room and study, as well as housing a recently refurbished Gaggenau kitchen and the fifth bedroom suite.

Three centuries ago, the feeling around The Court House, with towering ceilings, would have been that of despair and despondency, as magistrates decided the fate of highwaymen, drunkards and tax dodgers. The dominance of these grand historical masterpieces remains, although they now have an ambience of luxury and comfort.

The main house boasts five bedroom suites, each with en-suite bathrooms, as well as luxurious floor to ceiling wardrobes and full height bespoke doors. The grand master bedroom occupies the entire top floor, serviced by his and hers luxurious en-suite bathrooms, walk in wardrobes and private studies surmounted by vast skylights and partitioning doors.

If its four walls could whisper, they would tell of trials held for highway robbers, petty thieves and drunks.

The Court House was built in the early 18th century, and witnessed hundreds of trials of petty criminals. Most of the crimes dealt with inside its court rooms were for highway robberies committed by footpads along the dark lanes between Chelsea and the capital.

Convicted criminals were taken on short walk to prison ships moored on the River Thames, before being shipped to British Penal colonies.

Legend has it there is a secret 
underground passage located underneath both buildings, which was used to
 transport the old court’s most dangerous convicts to the prison ships 
moored on the nearby banks of the river.

After the last prisoner was sentenced, the Court House - one of the few buildings surviving from Chelsea's early days, became a wine warehouse before becoming home to a warren of tiny artists' and architect's studios.

Today, while the interior has been transformed, the building's exterior remains largely untouched.
