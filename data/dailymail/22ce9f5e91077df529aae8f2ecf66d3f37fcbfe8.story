A homeless man who sleeps at a Virginia homeless shelter is going to celebrate Thanksgiving with a couple that has volunteered to host him.

Neal Shytles told WTKR earlier this month he'd hoped to not be alone on the national holiday.

'I am lonely like 365 days a year, but Christmas and Thanksgiving are like two of the worst days, and I really miss having some kind of family atmosphere around me,' he told the affiliate station.

Not alone: Neal Shytles is set to celebrate Thanksgiving with Cory and Ashley McLemore this week 

Helping hand: Ashley McLemore said she was touched by Shytles, because she and her husband are a military couple and are away from their family 

'It would mean the world to me if somebody took me in. Just for that one day, you know, for a couple hours, you know,' he also said. 

Shytles received numerous offers from willing hosts when his story was broadcast by WTKR - the first of which was made by Cory and Ashley McLemore, the television station reported.

Shytles told WTKR last week of the offers 'It was like bam, bam, bam, one good thing after the other, and I was just so happy you know.'

He also said of Ashley McLemore's offer 'I was crying when she called me, and I had to excuse myself because I was emotional.'

Joy: Shytles has said of the offers he's received 'It was like bam, bam, bam, one good thing after the other, and I was just so happy you know'

'They want to feed me lunch and then Thanksgiving dinner later, so I'm getting a double blessing, I guess you would say,' he also said in the interview.

Ashley McLemore, meanwhile, told the television station 'He started crying and then I started crying a little bit and then we were both crying.'

She also told WKTR 'Because we've been [a military couple] and I identify with having to move away from your family and not having family around for the holidays so, it kind of struck a chord with me.'

'I just look forward to having him in our house and being a part of our family for the day,' she also revealed. 

Shyltes expressed his gratitude via the television station, saying 'I love both you and your husband even though I haven't met you. Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.'
