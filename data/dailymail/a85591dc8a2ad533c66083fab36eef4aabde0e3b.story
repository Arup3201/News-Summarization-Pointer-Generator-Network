A newborn baby pulled from the rubble after an airstrike in Syria destroyed the home she was in is alive and well.

Rateb Malis was only 27 days old when a bomb blew up a relative's house in the Duma neighbourhood north-east of Damascus last week.

Today, his father, also called Rateb, was pictured with the child and his sister Maria, who was also rescued from under rubble.

The baby was rescued from rubble on January 7 after what activists said was an airstrike by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad

The tiny baby wrapped in a blanket is freed from the remains of its home after an air strike carried out by forces loyal to the Syrian leader.

He was among the children, their faces covered in thick dust mixed with their own tears, were hauled from the wreckage following the latest bomb attack on Damascus, in which a number of civilians were killed.

Witnesses said they had seen military helicopters dropping devastating 'barrel bombs' on residential areas in the Douma district of the city.

Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear, many of them barefoot, their clothes blackened and torn in the blast.

Innocent: The tiny infant, dressed in a blue baby-grow appeared to have survived the air strike unharmed

Saved: Rateb is lifted high above the heads of rescuers as other children are also carried to safety

Other rescue workers carried the youngsters high above their heads as they desperately tried to carry them to safety.

The strike, which activists say was carried out by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over.

The chemicals were loaded onto a Danish ship and taken out of the country last week under tight security, an important milestone in the international operation to rid President Assad of the weapons by the middle of the year.

The operation at Syria's port of Latakia took place against the backdrop of a widening civil war and escalating infighting between a chaotic mix of Syrian rebel brigades and an Al Qaeda linked militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Horror: A man desperately tries to take the child to safety

The chemicals were supposed to have been removed from Syria by December 31, but poor security, bad weather and other factors meant the deadline was missed by a week.

The raw materials - precursor chemicals for poison gas - were moved to the government-held port of Latakia from two sites in Syria and loaded onto the Danish cargo ship, which then set sail, said Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch diplomat coordinating the joint mission by the UN and Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

Security for the highly toxic cargo is being provided by warships from Russia, China, Denmark and Norway.

The chemicals will eventually be transferred to a U.S. ship, the Cape Ray, which has been fitted with special machinery.

Once aboard the American vessel, the materials will be placed in a titanium reactor that uses heated water and other chemicals to render the weapons inert.

Fear: The little boy cries as he is carried by his determined rescuers

Heroic: Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear

Pressure: The strike came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over

Devastation: The war, now in its third year, has killed more than 130,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Right, which keeps track of the fighting

Destruction: Another strike in the Haydariyeh quarter of Aleppo killed at least six civilians
