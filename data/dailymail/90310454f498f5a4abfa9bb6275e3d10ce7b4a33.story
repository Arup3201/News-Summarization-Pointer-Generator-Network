The estranged wife of a pastor from suburban Chicago has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to poison her three daughters and stabbing two of them so they could 'meet Jesus Christ.'

Pamela Christensen, 47, from Montgomery, was ordered held on $1million bail Thursday in connection to the September 25 knife attack.

Police officers who responded to the Christensens' home in the 2300 block of Patron Lane after getting two 911 hang-ups were met at the door by the mother of three, whose white shirt was splattered with blood.

The 47-year-old dropped to her knees in front of the officers and told them she had tried to kill her daughters, according to court documents.

Two of the girls were found upstairs with stab wounds to the chest. Their mother also knifed herself in the chest and abdomen.

Mrs Christensen was taken to an area hospital for treatment, where she remained until Wednesday.

Following her release, the married mother of three was charged with first-degree attempted murder, aggravated battery and aggravated restraint. She is due back in court October 16.

Court records obtained by Chicago Sun-Times indicate that during her interview with police, the woman admitted to making a poisonous cocktail containing dishwashing detergent, which she was hoping to give her daughters so they would fall asleep, but the girls refused to drink the concoction. 

Rapture: Pamela Christensen said she had received messages from her estranged husband, Pastor Vaughn Christensen, telling her the end of the world was near and instructing her to get her kids ready to meet Jesus

When interviewed by police, Christensen’s daughters, ages 12, 16 and 19, told investigators that their mother held them at knifepoint and asked if they accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. 

Two of the three girls suffered knife wounds. According to court documents, Pamela Christensen said she was sending her children to 'meet Jesus Christ.' 

When police discovered the children just before 11am on September 25, all three were dressed in white. The girls were taken to a hospital for treatment and later released. 

Pamela Christensen told detectives that her husband, Pastor Vaughn Christensen, had left messages on her phone telling his wife that the end of the world was coming and instructing her to prepare their children to meet Jesus.

According to court records, the couple are in the midst of a messy divorce. In August, the wife obtained an order of protection against her clergyman husband, claiming that he had become erratic and increasingly violent towards the family, threatening to harm the children, as well as himself.

Police said they had received several calls from the Christensen residence over the past few months about suicide threats.

The Christensens’ three daughters have been released into the custody of Pamela's father.
