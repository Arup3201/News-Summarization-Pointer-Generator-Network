An series of images by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has revealed the movement of glaciers in southern Alaska.

They reveal how the majority of glaciers have rapidly retreated since the late 19th Century - although a small minority have advanced.

The technique - known as repeat photography - helps scientists determine how much a region has changed over time.

Slide the images below to see the changing appearance of Alaska's glaciers over time 

Here the retreat of the Muir Inlet can be seen. On the left, a photograph taken on 13 August 1941 shows a glacier 0.43 miles (0.7km) thick, with large seracs - house-sized chunks of ice - on its face. By 11 August 2005, however, it has completely disappeared from view - seen on the right

By analysing the various photographic pairs, scientists can document the evolution of the Alaskan landscape, and see how it is responding to retreating glacier ice - with an interactive map also showing their locations.

The balance of glaciers and the surrounding environment can drastically affect ecosystems.

When glaciers retreat, as many have done since 1850, it can affect the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use.

It can also affect animal and plans that depend on melt-water from glaciers, while in the longer term it can cause ocean levels to rise.

The increasing rate at which glaciers are retreating is one indication of how global warming is already affecting the planet.

One pair of images shows the west shoreline of Muir Inlet, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, in Alaska - and the changes that have taken place since 1892.

One photograph, taken on 13 August 1941, shows a glacier 0.43 miles (0.7km) thick, with large seracs - house-sized chunks of ice - on its face.

By 11 August 2005, however, the glacier has completely disappeared from, the same location, having retreated more than 31 miles (50km).

In its place, abundant vegetation is located on the slopes in the photograph.

Another pair of images show the retreat of the Reid Glacier between 10 June 1899 and 6 September 2003.

The photograph from 1899 is taken towards the northwest and shows the 197-foot (60 metres) high terminus of the retreating glacier.

By 104 years later, the glacier has retreated 1.9 miles (3km) and is barely visible in the same field of view.

Again, vegetation becomes much more abundant as it retreats.

The retreat of Reid Glacier between 10 June 1899 (left) and 6 September 2003 (right) is seen here. The glacier has retreated 1.9 miles (3km) and is barely visible, while more vegetation has begun to grow on the side of the hills

The images of the glaciers in southern Alaska (locations shown here) were compiled by the United States Geological Survey (USGS)

This set of images shows the remarkable retreat of the McCarty Glacier between 30 July 1909 (left) and 11 August 2004 (right). The retreat of the glacier here took place over a distance of about 9.8 miles (15km)

The first photograph on the left is of the Northwestern Glacier at some point between the mid-1920s and 1940s. A second photograph on the right, taken on 12 August 2005, shows how it has retreated more than 6.2 miles (10km) out of view

Another set of images show the stunning retreat of McCarty Glacier between 30 July 1909 and 11 August 2004. The retreat of the glacier here is about 9.8 miles (15km)

In a pair of north looking photographs, taken looking west of Harris Bay, another dramatic retreat of ice can be seen.

The first photograph is an undated winter to summer view from a postcard, likely from between the mid-1920s and the 1940s.

A second photograph, taken on 12 August 2005, shows a startlingly different view of the same location. In the area, the Northwestern Glacier has retreated more than 6.2 miles (10km) out of view.

The aptly named Toboggan Glacier, meanwhile, with a gentle slope running down into water, is seen retreating during 103 years between 20 August 1905 and 22 August 2008.

The aptly named Toboggan Glacier is seen on the left on 20 August 1905. 103 years later on 22 August 2008, right, it has almost completely disappeared

One of the most dramatic pairs of images sees Pederson Glacier, pictured right in the mid-1920s to 1940s, replaced by vegetation including grasses and shrubs by 10 August 2005, seen on the right

Not all the glaciers have been on the retreat. Harvard Glacier is seen on the left on 1 July 1909, but by 3 September 2000 - right - it had advanced 0.78 miles (1.25km)

One of the most dramatic pairs of images is the Pederson Glacier, seen rapidly from the mid-1920s and 1940s to 10 August 2005. In its place, most of the lake has filled with sediment, and now supports several varieties of grasses, shrubs and aquatic plants.

But not all the glaciers have been on the retreat. One, Harvard Glacier, has advanced 0.78 miles (1.25km) between 1 July 1909 and 3 September 2000, seen in a pair of images.

Overall, though, the images highlight how the changing climate is having a rapid effect on a variety of ecosystems – and not necessarily for the better.

Images have shown how many glaciers in southern Alaska have retreated since the late 18th Century

@highlight

Some are seen retreating by several miles in just over 100 years as global warming takes its toll

@highlight

In some instances vegetation and new water springs up in the place of the old glacier

But glacial retreat can negatively affect the surrounding environment and  ecosystems
