Hamilton had been an Opry member for more than 50 years, since 1960, when he made the switch from pop music to country.

He went on to take country music to the world â€” from London's first International Festival of Country Music in 1969 to being the first American country singer to play in Russia and Czechoslovakia.

Hamilton was the first American to record a studio album in Eastern Europe.

He also played country music festivals in Finland, Germany, Holland and Sweden.

Hamilton became the first American country singer to have his own British TV series and hosted a Canadian show for six years.

He became known as the 'international ambassador of country music.'

Hamillton once said the decision to switch to country came after catching a performance of the Opry at Ryman Auditorium.

Hamilton worked with producer Chet Atkins on a number of hits and scored his first country No. 1 with 'Abilene' in 1963.
