Louise Thompson may have been the first Made In Chelsea starlet to launch her own clothing label but Binky Felstead is keen to give her co-star a run for her money in the style stakes.

The 24-year-old brunette has unveiled her debut clothing collection with Lipstick Boutique and showcases her toned new figure in the campaign images.

Speaking to MailOnline, Binky said: 'Recently I’ve really started to take a much keener interest in fashion. Also, with the girls on the show all being so fashionable, I get lots of inspiration from them.'

New range, new figure: Made In Chelsea starlet Binky Felstead showcases her debut clothing range for Lipstick Boutique

Known for her laid-back, quintessentially 'Chelsea' style, Binky has created a collection of easy-to-wear occasion pieces for this year's party season, with each garment named after an upmarket area in London.

From slashed-to-the-thigh maxis, to smart and sexy separates, the collection aims to offer all the evening looks you’ll need to take you through the season ahead.

With its dark autumnal shades and striking graphic prints, Binky wanted her collection to be full of wearable styles that she hopes will take women from cocktails on Sloane Square, to dinner on the Embankment, or a grand ball in Knightsbridge.

The bubbly brunette follows in the 
footsteps of Lydia Rose Bright, Jessica Wright and Danielle Lloyd, who 
have all designed ranges for Lipstick Boutique.

Speaking about the inspiration behind her new range, she said: 'My style is pretty casual and laid back, and people on Twitter kept asking me if I was going to bring out my own collection, and that they loved the stuff I wore, so I thought I’d try a few things and see what happens.

'I really wanted to inject my own style into glamourous easy-to-wear evening outfits.'

Binky, who recently underwent a £670 fat freezing treatment to shift the unwanted pounds, shows off her toned new body in the campaign images.

'I loved seeing the collection all finished and it was really cool to be able to wear something that I’d designed –  I never thought that day would come,' the star said about modelling the range herself.

Binky also visited an intense boot camp to get in shape ahead of the new season but admits she has fallen off the diet bandwagon recently.

'I’ve been so busy filming at the moment that I haven’t [exercised] recently, but I’m planning to get back into it next week,' she said.

The Chelsea girl, who describes her own personal style as 'casual, comfortable and individual', says that her fellow cast mates have already asked to don her designs.

Binky, who is well-liked by everyone on the show, says that she admires Millie and Rosie's sense of style and that her ultimate style icon is Blake Lively ('She’s my style crush, I really like the boho chic look').

It is not long before 
the most famous faces in Chelsea return to our TV screens for the sixth 
series of their Bafta-winning reality show.

Binky says we can expect new cast members, tears, drama, break -ups, make-ups, and new relationships.

As well as filming for the new series and designing her own clothing range, Binky has been keeping busy and has lots of projects on the go.

'I am launching my own nail varnish range called Binky London, which is very exciting, and potentially have a book coming up, and of course launching my range for Lipstick Boutique in October,' she added.
