Sick: This picture shows the selfie taken by heroin addict Kirsty Edmondson - as former history teacher Kenneth Chapman lay murdered beneath her

This picture shows the shocking selfie taken by a heroin addict - as a former history teacher lay dead beneath her after he was murdered by her boyfriend.

Kirsty Edmondson, 23, and 35-year old Christopher Sawyers used mobiles phones to take 'trophy photos' and had sex with each other in Kenneth Chapman's bed whilst they lived with his corpse for up to a week.

In this image, released with the consent of Mr Chapman's family, the victim's body was in the room as Edmondson took the photograph, although he can not be seen.

Other pictures have not been released for reasons of public decency.

During their trial, Manchester Crown Court was told that Sawyers had injected Mr Chapman with a fatal dose of heroin to 'off him', and take his money to buy more drugs.

The court heard how the pair behaved like 'vultures around a corpse' stealing the victim's TV and computer and raiding his bank account in a string of online frauds.

They even texted the victim's sister pretending to be 47-year old Scotsman Chapman asking if she could lend him £75.

Police were called in after concerns about the victim's welfare and found him dead at his flat in Eccles, Greater Manchester.  Tests showed he had been injected with a lethal dose of heroin.

It emerged Sawyers had realised there was 'money to be made out of murder' after he got away with killing a former accountant with the same drug - 17 months before Chapman's death.

After the latest killing he had shown one of the selfie photos to his friends saying: 'Look at this. I will show you a photo of a corpse.' In another bragging outburst he declared: 'I'm a serial killer now.'

Career criminal Sawyers was convicted of murder and manslaughter and jailed for life with a minimum recommendation he serve 33 years.

He
 admitted two thefts and seven fraud charges. Edmondson was jailed for 
three years after she admitted two charges of theft and nine of fraud. 
She wept as she was cleared of murder.

At
 Manchester Crown Court the judge Mr Justice Timothy Holroyde said: 'A 
phrase from the trial springs to mind - the pair of you were "like 
vultures around a corpse".

'Within
 a very short time you were stripping Kenneth Chapman of what he owned, 
selling it for what you could get and reducing the flat which had been 
so kept and tidy to a scene of disorder and despoliation.

Victim: Former history teacher 
Kenneth Chapman was injected with a fatal dose of heroin by Christopher Sawyers

'Anyone
 who doubted the malign and destructive effects of the misuse of class A
 drugs should have sat and listened to the evidence in this trial.

'Those
 who have sat and listened have heard evidence that vividly showed the 
utter degradation wrought upon those who had become addicted to such 
drugs.

'It has been 
strikingly apparent throughout as indeed both defendants have frankly 
acknowledged, that their use of Class A controlled drugs had brought 
them to the state in which their wholly dominant and overriding concern 
was getting their next fix however they could.

'Kirsty Edmondson in two sentences in her
 evidence summed it up: "drugs change your life and change your morals",
 and "smackheads don't really have consciences".

He told Sawyers: 'You wanted to get your hands on everything Kenneth Chapman had, which you believed was substantial. When the opportunity arose, you took it quickly and ruthlessly.'

After the case Chapman's sister Moreen Sinclair said: 'The only comfort we draw from this is that others can be safe from Christopher Sawyers in the future.

'However, we can take no comfort in the lenience of the sentence given to Kirsty Edmondson who, in our eyes, abused the kindness that was shown to her by Ken. I still find it difficult to believe it has happened and Ken is gone.

'My family were still grieving the loss of our mother and now we have to deal with Ken's death. Since he has died I have had difficulty sleeping and as a result it has affected my work meaning I can no longer work shifts.

'His death has had a big impact on my son's life. They were very close. Paul has become depressed and has had medical attention. He also had to have six weeks off work since he passed away.

'Since his death I have received cards from people offering their condolences and saying how shocked they are. One from his teachers from the high school who were shocked saying he was a nice guy.'

Detective
 Chief Inspector Sarah Jones from Greater Manchester Police said: 
'Christopher Sawyers deliberately injected Kenneth Chapman with a fatal 
dose of heroin for one reason and one reason only: greed.

'It
 is our belief that he killed him in order to financially benefit from 
his death so that together with Kirsty Edmondson, they could continue to
 buy heroin.

'There is 
little doubt in my mind that the grip heroin had on them caused them to 
continue to periodically live with the dead body of Kenneth Chapman for 
in excess of a week in order to steal from him without ever giving a 
thought to the appalling nature of their crimes.'

During
 the trial the jury was told how Mr Chapman - a former soldier - had 
been a keen athlete and a member of a running club. He taught A level 
and GCSE history at Rivington and Blackrod High School in Chorley, 
Lancashire.

However, in 2007 he was disgraced when he went to prison for two and a half years for grooming a schoolgirl for sex in an internet chatroom.

He lost his teaching job and after his release met Edmondson when he became embroiled in the drugs scene and began associating with call girls for company.

He
 made £18,000 from the sale of his house and moved into rented 
accommodation and was believed to be contemplating a permanent move back
 to Berwick-upon-Tweed, Scotland after visiting his family over 
Christmas last year.

But 
tragedy struck on December 28 2013 after he met up with Edmondson and 
Sawyers and they went back to his flat where they took drugs.

When the
 victim fell unconscious he was administered with a lethal dose of heroin.

Mr
 Tony Cross QC prosecuting said: 'Christopher Sawyers and Kirsty 
Edmondson treated Kenneth Chapman's home and property as their exclusive
 preserve.

Keen athlete Kenneth Chapman had been a soldier before teaching A level and GCSE history at Rivington and 
Blackrod High School in Chorley, Lancashire.

In 2007 he was jailed for two and a half years after he admitted grooming a schoolgirl for
 sex in an internet chatroom.

He was also placed indefinitely onto the sex offenders' register and banned from ever working with children again.

He was forced to resign from his teaching job and after his release from prison met Kirsty Edmondson, soon becoming embroiled in the local drugs scene and associating with call 
girls for company.

He made 
£18,000 from the sale of his house and moved into rented accommodation.

He was believed to be contemplating a permanent move back to 
Berwick-upon-Tweed, Scotland after visiting his family over Christmas 
last year, only to be administered with the lethal dose of heroin by Christopher Sawyers on December 28, 2013.

'In
 the 15 days between the death of Mr Chapman and the discovery of his 
body these two defendants began to steal what they could from him - his 
TV, computer and from his bank account to purchase goods using a variety
 of different fraudulent methods.

'They
 even texting his sister pretending to be him to borrow money. These 
were callous and despicable actions. They began within hours of Kenneth 
Chapman's death and continued for days as the two defendants lived in 
the flat carrying on their lives whilst Mr Chapman lay dead.

'So
 twisted were their actions that they even took selfies of them enjoying
 themselves in the very same room as the cadaver. They took "selfies" in
 the very room where he lay rotting. These photos are trophy photos - 
two people proud of their work.

'They had sex in his bed and filmed it. They stole and committed fraud. Attempts were made to order goods via Amazon, top up mobile phones and pay forged cheques into Sawyers' bank account.

'This was how they lived their lives - using his home, car and property as their own. They did so because as Christopher Sawyers was later to tell witnesses - he wanted to 'off' him. To kill him. To end his life.'

Less than an hour after Mr Chapman is believed to have been killed, the pair were caught on CCTV driving around Salford in his car where they also attempted to withdraw £100 from his bank account. The couple moved out of the property on January 3 and Mr Chapman's body was found on January 12.

Police later spoke to a witness who said she had overheard overheard Sawyers talking to Edmondson about Chapman saying: 'We can't keep taking him for bits, we need to see him off. This is taking too long, we need to OD him.'

A Home Office pathologist later revealed that the morphine concentration in Chapman's body was the highest he had ever encountered in deaths from misuse of heroin.

The court heard Sawyer was also responsible for the death of former accountant Peter Clark, 60, who also drifted in the Manchester drugs scene.

He suffered a fatal collapse whilst he and Sawyers were taking heroin at a house in Ancoats, Manchester on July 5 2012. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Inquiries revealed he used Mr Clark's phone and stole cash from his wallet.
