Hundreds of people stripped naked and flocked to the Tasman Sea in what has been billed as the largest nude ocean swim on record.

More than 700 people turned out to protest against body image conformity on Sunday - and to enjoy a good swim in the baking heat in Sydney, Australia.

It was the second Sydney Skinny, which was attended by 750 people last year and raises money for Australia's National Parks.

Starting at 8am, the revellers deposited their clothes on the beach before swimming 900 metres around the diamond-shaped Middle Head island by Sydney's coast.

Some took to the waves excitedly with messages painted on their behinds, while some slipped out of their towels at the very last minute.

The crowds handed their clothes to people on the beach before standing nude in the summer sun

Speaking ahead of the event, one skinny dipper said: 'We are born naked. who cares who sees your body â€“ be naked with nature for a great cause. The more the merrier...'

Another wrote on the online event page: 'I'm quite shy and I have never swam naked before. But there is no embarrassment - it will be great fun.'

After the event, the bathers donned their clothes and headed to a festival arena, where there was live music to celebrate their feat.
