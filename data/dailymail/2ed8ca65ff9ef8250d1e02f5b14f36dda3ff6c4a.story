The mother of the teenage boy suspected of stabbing Ann Maguire to death had gone on holiday shortly before the tragedy, friends and  neighbours said yesterday.

She was in Gran Canaria when she heard the shocking news that her son was alleged to have killed his teacher, they said, and was yesterday making her way home to Leeds.

Further detail emerged yesterday of the boy's interest in violent video games and heavy metal bands.

Grim Reaper: The image the teenage suspect in the murder of Corpus 
Christi Catholic College teacher Ann Maguire used for his Facebook 
profile

The loner, who has a Grim Reaper image on his Facebook page, lived with his mother after she divorced his father, who has since found a new partner with whom he has a young child.

Neighbours and friends said his 
mother, a 47-year-old human resources manager, 'was away on holiday when
 all of this happened' and now faced 'every parent's worst nightmare'.

Pupils said the boy had become increasingly withdrawn in recent months. While
 he was in the top set in most subjects and was particularly talented 
at art, he had few friends at the school.

He allegedly said he wanted to
 kill himself because of bullying and had boasted of experimenting with 
drugs. He also left clues about his desperate state of mind on his 
Facebook page.

The boy 
posted two prominent pictures on his profile – one of the Grim Reaper 
and another blurry shot of himself in a T-shirt with the branding of 
Achievement Hunter, a YouTube channel that features a group of six men 
devoted to violent video games such as Call of Duty, Halo and Grand 
Theft Auto.

He had a keen interest in 'ultra-violent' video games and weeks before the murder posted a video promoting Dark Souls II, a game in which a 'cursed' character travels through dungeons killing zombies.  

'Cornerstone of her school': Spanish teacher Anne Maguire, 61, who was stabbed to death yesterday at the school where she worked, Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds

Caring: Mrs Maguire was described as a 'wonderful' teacher, who had touched the hearts of three generations of pupils

With pupils: Married with two grown-up daughters, Ann Maguire was a caring Spanish teacher known as 'the mother of her school'

Dark Souls II, which was released last
 month and can be played with others around the world, has a 16+ rating 
because of its 'realistic-looking violence'.

West Yorkshire Police yesterday said it was 'aware' of his online presence and it is 'forming part of their investigation'.

Classmates said the boy had started  to go into school with beer or whisky in recent months.

Chloe Ripley, 16, said: 'He was weird and lonely.'

The uncle of a friend said Mrs Maguire had generously paid for the boy's food when he was short of money for lunch, but had also disciplined him over using his mobile phone.

He said: 'Mrs Maguire used to give him dinner money when his dad left them with nothing.'

Police on scene: The fatal stabbing took place at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, West Yorkshire

A former pupil at the school, who knew
 the boy's 19-year-old brother, said: 'His mum was away on holiday and 
his brother was taking care of the house.

'That is why they haven't been able to question him yet because they are waiting for her to fly back.'

Friends
 of the boy's parents described him as a 'lovely, charming' child and 
said they were shocked at the supposed change in his character.

His father, a council executive and practising Catholic who recently celebrated his 50th birthday, lives in a smart row  of £350,000 terraces in a village just  outside Leeds with his partner and their young child.

The suspect's mother was in Gran Canaria when she heard the shocking news that her son was alleged to have killed his teacher, it was said

The boy visited often but lived with his mother and musician older brother, who plays in a local rock band, in a £115,000 house at the end of a cul-de-sac near  Corpus Christi School.

Friends of his mother insisted that she was a good parent.

Gudrun Wroot, who worked with her, said she juggled her job with being a single parent.

'It is awful for the family of the woman who has been killed, but it is also traumatic for the family of the boy,' Mrs Wroot said.

'You can't imagine what she must be feeling. It is just terrible.

'But really she is a nice person and a very caring mother. She was extremely concerned that the boys were brought up well and for all I knew they were.'

Police had yet to start questioning the boy yesterday. A spokesman declined to comment on whether or not his mother was in the country.

A spokesman for Leeds City Council said that for legal reasons it could not comment on whether social services were involved with the family.
