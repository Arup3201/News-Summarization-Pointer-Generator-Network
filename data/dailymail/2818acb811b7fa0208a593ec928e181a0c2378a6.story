Dolls are most commonly the plaything of young children, but woman still can't bear to be without hers...at the age of 48.

Cat from Seattle, Washington,  a mother of one, has been obsessed by an 18-inch plastic doll named Volo for the past eight years. The toy was a present from an ex-boyfriend.

She has become so dependent on Volo that she now believes she can't make it through the day without him by her side.

On the show, Cat can be seen taking Volo everywhere with her, from kayaking to shopping and even to bed.
