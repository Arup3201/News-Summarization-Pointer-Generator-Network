Police in a Massachusetts town have advised the public about a registered, homeless sex offender's decorated school bus.

The bus features curtains, stickers and the words 'God Bus' - and it was revealed on Facebook by the Yarmouth Police Department its owner is convicted sex offender John Stangl.

Stangl's mug shot, as well as a photograph of his bus, were uploaded on the Facebook page.

The police department said in a November 6 post 'Level 3 Sex Offender John J. Stangl is a convicted felon and is legally registered as homeless in Hyannis.

Vehicle: Level 3 sex offender John Stangl is homeless and living out of this school bus in Cape Cod

'This is the vehicle that he uses and lives in and sometimes travels all over Cape Cod in. It was observed by the Yarmouth Police PAC UNIT Commander this morning at Chase Garden Park on Route 28 in West Yarmouth near Standish Way.

'Please be vigilant...'

Yarmouth police said Stangl, 65, weighs 300 pounds and stands six feet tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes. 

He was convicted in October 2008 for open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior 'x4,' police said.

The Yarmouth Police Department posted a message to the public from Chief of Police Steven Xiarhos regarding Stangl on November 7.

The message said 'Level 3 Sex Offender John Stangl is not wanted by the police and is currently following all of the rules and laws regarding registering as a Sex Offender.

'Mr. Stangl has the right to travel and drive anywhere and everyone should be reminded that he currently has the right to be free and no one should harass or intimidate him. It is a crime.

'Everyone should be aware of his status and feel free to take the time to become educated with the Sex Offender Registry Laws in Massachusetts.'

Xiarhos, speaking to Boston Magazine, said 'Because we are who we are, we are very proactive in the use of social media and social policing. His home is the bus. I decided to put the picture out.'

He also said that '[Stangl] came back in [following the picture's publication], he told us that he re-registered in Barnstable. You can be homeless, but you have to let them know you are homeless in their town. We were just educating the public. Our legal right and duty is to let the public know...but this man has done everything he is supposed to do, and he’s not wanted by the police.'

Xiarhos explained to the website 'This man is dangerous, it’s very clear he is dangerous, according to [the Sex Offender Registry Board]. That is their way of telling the public that. But we also have to defend his rights. We did take a unique step by putting up a picture of his home - which in a way is a mobile home - and now the public is reacting.'

Capt. John Rogers with the Plymouth Police Department told Boston Magazine 'We have gotten a few calls. But there’s not a lot we can do about it. Because of the social media attached to this, any place he goes, we get a call about him. From a police perspective, he’s legally registered, and if he commits a crime we’ll investigate. But it’s the bus that’s the real draw on this [attention].'

Like Xiarhos, Rogers also told the website that Stangl is not wanted. 

Stangl's bus has been in Kingston, Yarmouth, and Plymouth, the website reported on Tuesday.

There was also a bus sighting in Taunton on Wednesday, MyFoxBoston reported.
