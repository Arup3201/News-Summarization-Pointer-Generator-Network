He was removed from the court after telling the judge he wanted to represent himself and instead she appointed him a public defender.

As he was taken out, the 28-year-old cried 'hail satan!'

Scott left the young woman for dead close to Jefferson Memorial Forest last Friday, police said in a report.

She was in a critical condition in hospital after suffering serious head trauma and was expected to have lasting damage from the brutal attack.  

The accused was being held at Louisville Metro Correction on a $100,000 cash bond.
