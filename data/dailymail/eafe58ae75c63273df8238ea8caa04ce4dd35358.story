A lone young seal has been captured on camera playing hide and seek with a Labrador dog in a touching moment filmed by the Thames.

The rare scene was captured on a mobile phone Nicola White and David Nolan as they took their dog Mischa by the river in Greenwich, London, earlier this month.

Within seconds of the footage starting, a young Harbour seal can be seen leaping out of the water and landing on a river walkway right next to the dog.

The unlikely duo can then be seen playing hide and seek throughout the four minute, 35 second video clip, which was uploaded by Ms White to YouTube.

Mr Nolan said: 'We were mudlarking on the Thames on the day in question, we always take Mischa, our 13-year-old Labrador bitch.

'Before the video was taken she went for a swim by herself and to our amazement the seal was swimming and playing with her in the water.

'The seal would pop up and Mischa would swim towards the seal only for it to disappear and Mischa to chase the seal in a sort of merry-go-round.

'The seal then followed us along the shoreline, paying particular attention to Mischa, whom the seal had obviously mistaken for another, very blonde, seal.

'When we got to Morden Wharf the seal got out and "played" as in the video.

 I've owned Mischa for 13 years, she was
"happily excited" by the experience and reacting in her usual manner 
when she is playing.

The pair also managed to spot a numbered ID tag on the seal and attempted to find out more about where it had come from.

Mr Nolan continued: 'I subsequently made investigations having recorded the tag number.

'I discovered that the female seal had been rehabilitated after being orphaned and raised by people at the RSPCA seal sanctuary in East Winch - Kings Lynn, Norfolk - hence it's relaxed attitude towards humans.

'It was released two years ago - so it's had some journey.

'The RSPCA really deserve recognition for what they do - this young seal proves that their hard work has paid off.'

Mr Nolan said they have actually seen the same seal on three occasions now.

He added: 'It also shows how clean the Thames is now to sustain such wildlife. We have seen the seal now on three separate occasions now the latest being last weekend.

'It was an incredible experience and I'd never been that close to a seal before.

'She was inches away from me and there
was no menace or belligerence, just curiosity and almost as if she 
wanted us to interact.'

The video entitled 'Greenwich Thames Seal playing with dog 2nd Feb 2013' was uploaded to YouTube by Ms White on February 3.

It has so far been viewed more than 5,000 times and received delighted feedback from viewers.

One viewer said they had a similar experience with a seal in the same area.

They wrote: 'I also work on﻿ the Thames , I was on the work boat 'driftwood 3' that day at chalkstones (near Greenwich) and that seal was playing around our boat for about an hour... Very nice to see...'

Another added: 'I work on the River Thames and have to say this is an amazing bit of footage. We had﻿ one resident seal at Trinity Buoy wharf last year, he came back every evening for about a week or so, but to get one this tame is just amazing to watch'.
