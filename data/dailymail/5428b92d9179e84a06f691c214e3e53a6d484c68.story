Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce says Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow are being sold to Newcastle United against his wishes.

The Premier League club are set to complete the double signing of defender Lascelles, 21, and goalkeeper Darlow, 23, but they will be loaned back to Forest for the rest of the season.

Pearce, though, is not happy with the deal, thought to be worth in the region of £7million for the Championship club.

‘We had an offer from Newcastle, that I was made aware of last week, in regards to the two players going there,’ he said.

‘The figures that were mentioned, by the representative of our club – I said I would not do that deal, when I was asked the question.

‘I thought I could push their value up and that they would be worth more in the long run.

Unhappy: But new boss Stuart Pearce is disappointed that the pair are due to be sold

‘The first I heard today (Monday) about things was when Jamaal Lascelles came in and told me that he had a medical at 2pm at Newcastle.

‘That disappointed me greatly. I do not agree with it. But the only olive branch I have got is that the boys are both coming back on a year loan, which is a bonus.'
