Nicolas Colsaerts set a new European Tour longest drive record with a 447-yard behemoth from the 18th tee on day two at the Wales Open - they don't call him the Muscles from Brussels for nothing.

Colsaerts practically perfect shot on the 613-yard last at Celtic Manor overtook the previous record of 442 yards by Shiv Kapur at the 2012 Madeira Islands Open.

Adding to the Belgian's feat on Thursday at the 2010 Ryder Cup's venue is the fact Colsaerts made the best possible use of his drive.

Colsaerts showed just why he is called the Muscles from Brussels

He took a gap wedge for his second stroke and breezily slotted the putt for his eagle for a five-under 66 for the day and push for the lead of the Wales Open at the halfway point. 

'The hole was playing downwind and I managed to get a good bounce,' the modest 31-year-old said. 

'I thought it was too far right but it's all downhill and downwind and it must have luged down the fairway. If all the stars align you can hit it a long way.'

Bubba Watson is the only player from the PGA Tour this season to exceed 400 yards for a drive, with his 424-yard effort on the 16th hole at Firestone by far the front marker.
