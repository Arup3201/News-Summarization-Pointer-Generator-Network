A Sydney judge, who said incest was becoming more socially acceptable, has been stepped down until an investigation into his comments is complete.

Judge Garry Neilson, aged in his 60s, has come under fire after saying the community may no longer see sexual contact between siblings and between adults and children as 'unnatural' or 'taboo', just as homosexuality is now widely accepted.

The comments were made while he was presiding over a case of a woman who had allegedly been sexually abused by her older brother when she was 10 and 18 years old.

Judge Neilson said the abuse she suffered as an adult did not need to be considered in relation to the abuse she suffered as a child because by that time she had been 'sexually awoken', the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Judge Garry Neilson will not take on any new court cases while his comments are being investigated

Late on Friday, Chief Judge of the District Court Justice Reg Blanch made the announcement that Justice Neilson would not be taking on any more cases.

'I have now been advised by the Attorney-General that he has referred the matter to the Judicial Commission and Judge Neilson will not sit in crime until this matter is determined,' he said in a statement. 

Justice Blanch said no further comment would be made on the matter.

Judicial commission members will examine the complaint before potentially referring it on to the conduct division. They decide whether a complaint justifies the removal of a judicial officer.

Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston has sent letters to the Attorney General and the Chief Justice of NSW calling for Judge Neilson's sacking and demanding a review of all the decisions he has made

If they determine Judge Neilson should be sacked, he would become the first judicial judge to be sacked by parliament, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Earlier on Friday, NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard asked Justice Blanch to prevent Judge Neilson presiding over criminal trials while he was investigated by the judicial commission.

'With that context I was extremely concerned to read the comments of His Honour Judge Garry Neilson in regard to his views on incest,' Mr Hazzard said in a statement.

'In my view, the community would be rightly appalled at his reported comments.

'Incest is completely reprehensible, unacceptable, disgusting and criminal.'

But Judge Neilson defended his comments to Daily Mail Australia: 'My comments were taken completely out of context, I think it's a fabrication'.

Judge Neilson made the comments in the case of a 58-year-old western Sydney man who is charged with repeatedly sexually abusing his younger sister at the family home in 1981.

He said that just as community attitudes towards homosexuality had changed since the 1950s and 1960s: 'a jury might find nothing untoward in the advance of a brother towards his sister once she had sexually matured, had sexual relationships with other men and was now "available", not having [a] sexual partner'.

Judge Neilson also said: 'If this was the 50s and you had a jury of 12 men there, which is what you'd invariably have, they would say it's unnatural for a man to be interested in another man or a man being interested in a boy. Those things have gone.'

The 58-year-old man had previously pleaded guilty to raping his sister when she was 10 or 11 years old in the 1970s.

But he pleaded not guilty to the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, with an alternative charge of incest, relating to the events in 1981.

NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard has asked the chief judge of the district court Justice Reg Blanch to prevent Judge Neilson presiding over criminal trials

On April 7, the Crown Prosecutor requested the jury be told of his previous convictions, arguing that without this knowledge jurors may struggle to understand that the man had a tendency to be sexually attracted to his sister and may also question why she never told other family members of the abuse.

But Judge Neilson refused, saying the abuse she suffered as an adult did not need to be considered in relation to the abuse she suffered as a child.

'By that stage they are both mature adults. The complainant has been sexually awoken, shall we say, by having two relationships with men and she had become 'free' when the second relationship broke down,' Judge Neilson said.

Judge Neilson also suggested the only reason incest was still a crime was because to 'prevent chromosomal abnormalities', but said that has become less relevant because of the availability of contraception and abortion.

It has also emerged that in November 2011 Judge Neilson gave a man who raped his niece when she was 15 and 16 a shorter sentence because 'there was no rough handling involved' and he did not ejaculate.

The case concerned a 55-year-old man who indecently assaulted his niece multiple times in her bedroom in 2007 and 2008.

The man was in a de facto relationship with the victim's mother and lived in the same home.

In considering the most serious offence, 'when penile/vaginal intercourse occurred without consent over a number of minutes', Judge Neilson took the view that it fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness 'because there had been no ejaculation involved, so that the victim had not been exposed to the risk of pregnancy or having some sexually transmitted disease passed on to her'.

In the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in March 2013 justices Derek Price, Lucy McCallum and Monika Schmidt said the comment was 'entirely questionable'.

Justice Blanch's Friday announcement comes after child abuse groups expressed disgust at Judge Neilson's comments.

Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston said she had sent a letter to the Attorney General and the Chief Justice of NSW calling for Judge Neilson's sacking.

'I also want them to revisit all the decisions he has made, in case they have created a precedent in sentencing which other judges have had to follow,' Ms Johnston told Daily Mail Australia on Friday.

'Clearly he's held these views for some time and it's gone unchecked.

'He’s been making all kinds of decisions for years, he's not a young man.'

Adults Surviving Child Abuse president Dr Cathy Kezelman said Judge Neilson's comments were 'disgraceful'.

'The Attorney General needs to look at his appointment,' Dr Kezelman told Daily Mail Australia.

'This level of ignorance cannot be tolerated on our benches.'

Dr Kezelman added that his 'misogynistic, paternalistic' views were damaging and said his conflation of incest with homosexuality was offensive.

'As a society we've come to understand homosexuality - that does not mean there's any parallel, not for a second, with child sex abuse and incest.'
