A New Zealand woman allegedly bombarded the best-selling author of a book on the Harry Potter series with threats and abuse, according to a federal court complaint.

Jessica Elizabeth Parker is said to have sent a barrage of abuse over a five year period to New York-based Harry, A History author Melissa Anelli.

Ms Parker is accused of threatening to slit the throat of Ms Anellli and is even said to have got a tattoo of the Potter expert's face, according to the New York Post.

Victim: Harry Potter expert and bestselling author Melissa Anelli who has allegedly been stalked by a New Zealand woman for the past five years

It is claimed that the abuse began in 2008 when Ms Parker was banned from Ms Anelli's The Leaky Cauldron fan website after writing abusive and violent posts about Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.

According to the New York Daily News, the complaint file states that Ms Parker wrote on a postcode sent to Ms Anelli's parents: 'As long as you refuse to deal with me, I'll remain that little demon on your shoulder.

'I can't be denied forever...Else I will return to your home and flay you alive.'

The FBI has secured a warrant for Ms Parker's arrest.

Miss Anelli welcomed the news, saying in a statement on The Leaky Cauldron site earlier today: 'It has been a long five years of continuous threats and abuse, not only to me but my family, friends, and colleagues. I only hope it’s carried through to justice being served.

Bestseller: Melissa Anelli wrote Harry, A History, left, a book written about J.K Rowling's series of books and subsequent film adaptations starring Daniel Radcliffe, right

'I want to thank the Leaky community for its constant support over the past decade-plus, for its support now, and for its understanding while I refrain from discussing particulars in order to assure this sees a proper end.'

She had told the New York Post yesterday: 'It’s awful what she’s done to me.

'There is no structure in place to help you when someone overseas stalks you.'

Ms Anelli has been running The Leaky Cauldron site since 2001.

The former News reporter's book has been published in eight different countries and in four languages.

She is currently working on her second non-fiction book.
