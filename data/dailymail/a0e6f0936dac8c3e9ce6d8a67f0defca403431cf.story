Millions of ten-inch-long mice have colonised a 25-mile-wide island - and are decimating local bird populations.

Gough Island is a remote British colony between the tips of South America and South Africa - inhabited by 10 million birds, in 20 rare species

But mice, introduced 150 years ago, are now eating their way through 1.25 million chicks a year - and scientists are calling for the invaders to be exterminated.

Wanless is calling for introduced mice to be dealt with as a threat on Gough Island and similar remote places - and for the mice of Gough Island to be exteriminated

'The sheer densities of the numbers of birds there—that's why Gough Island is so special,' said study co-author Ross Wanless, of the University of Cape Town in an interview with National Geographic.

'But the mice seem to be chewing away through those.'

The local mice have grown, and now measure ten inches from nose to tail.

Wanless is calling for introduced mice to be dealt with as a threat on Gough Island and similar remote places - and for the mice of Gough Island to be exteriminated.

'We studied the fate of 178 Atlantic Petrel Pterodroma incerta nests at Gough Island, over four seasons, from October 2003 to January 2008. 

'Introduced house mice Mus musculus were found in all study burrows checked for mouse visits,' says Wanless.

Wanless witnessed mice devouring six healthy petrel chicks, and one great shearwater chicks.

Every year, chicks died from mouse attacks - and less than 25% survived to adulthood.

'However, in the one season studied from laying to fledging (2007), from 58 nests, only one chick fledged,' says Wanless.

The reality may be even more severe, says Wanless, after computer-modelling various estimates of the fate of Gough Island.

'More than 60% of model simulations resulted in an International Union for Conservation of Nature classification of Endangered,' says Wanless. 'Our results add support to calls to eradicate mice from Gough Island. More generally, mice cannot be ignored as a potential threat to island fauna, and island restoration and management plans should routinely include eradication of introduced mice.'
