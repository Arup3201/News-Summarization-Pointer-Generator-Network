A father of three accused of deliberately driving over one of his estranged wife's Chihuahuas has pleaded not guilty to animal cruelty charges.

Michael Parker, 45, has denied murdering the dog - called Cow Cow - despite two security videos showing him release her from the trunk of his vehicle, then accelerate directly towards her before driving off and leaving her for dead.

The incident occurred in an alley in Hawthorne, California, on December 28.

Cow Cow’s body wasn’t found until several days later when a nearby resident discovered her.

The resident then contacted Hawthorne Police who used the surveillance video to track down and arrest Parker in January.

He was charged on Tuesday with felony counts of animal cruelty and animal neglect and a misdemeanor charge of petty theft of a dog.

Parker’s estranged wife Olga told KTLA in January that she believed Cow Cow, who was five and half, was killed in retaliation for her having not given Parker money from their retirement fund.

'If someone would do that to a dog… what would he do to my kids,' she said. The couple have two sons and a daughter.

Parker allegedly took another of the family dogs - Lucky - but he escaped and survived.

Parker faces over five years in state prison if convicted on all counts. He was ordered to return to the Airport Branch of the Los Angeles Superior Court on April 25.

In the disturbing surveillance video, Parker is seen driving his four-door sedan into the alley, getting out of his vehicle, opening and closing the trunk and then climbing back into the car.

Seconds later, Cow Cow scurries out from behind the vehicle and darts in front of it.

Parker then backs up and directs his vehicle straight at the defenseless dog.

'It's shocking. You never expect to see a little animal like that run over and left there to die without the driver even looking back. It wasn't an accident. He purposefully did it,' said Hawthorne Police Lt. Scott Swain.

Parker has admitted to police that he was in the alley, but claims he didn't mean to harm the family pet.

The horrific cruelty has drawn much interest from animal lovers and one online petition has garnered nearly 3,000 signatures in support of Parker’s prosecution.

'He aimed right at the helpless little dog, who was looking up at his "devoted owner," ran over the little guy and then zoomed off without a second thought,' the petition reads.
