A grieving father's emotional appeal to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has prompted the social network to release a retrospective video tribute of the Missouri man's deceased 21-year-old son.

John Berlin, 46, of St Louis, posted a YouTube message to Zuckerberg on Wednesday to ask for a copy of Facebook's new 'look back' video feature for his late son.

Jesse Berlin, a guitarist in a rock band, died in his sleep in January 2012 of unknown causes. Although his Facebook page still exists, his family were unable to access it to get the video.

Heartfelt: In an emotional YouTube message John Berlin pleaded with Facebook to release his son's film

The automated tool, a new feature added to celebrate the social network's tenth anniversary, creates a 62-second video using photos and comments previously posted by Facebook users.

In his YouTube plea, which was viewed more than 1.5 million times, Mr Berlin made an emotional plea to Zuckerberg while wearing a T-shirt for his son's band, Fivefold.

'You ever do something crazy 'cause you just don't know what to do anymore?' a tearful Mr Berlin said in the plea. 'Well, that's what I'm doing right now.'

Facebook typically disables the accounts of people who have died. But the company said in a statement Thursday that it granted Mr Berlin's request and suggested Facebook might alter its policies on information posted by users who later died.

'With the number of people using our service, it's often very difficult to act on behalf of one. But John's story and emotion moved us to take action - so we did,' the statement said.

'This experience reinforced to us that there's more Facebook can do to help people celebrate and commemorate the lives of people they have lost. We'll have more to share in the coming weeks and months.'

Mr Berlin, a personal trainer, said Thursday he was overwhelmed by Facebook's rapid response as well as the messages of support he has received from all over the world.

'I never expected any of this to happen,' he said. 'All I want is every little piece of him I can get.'

In a post under the YouTube video, he said: 'The response is overwhelming ...Â  I didn't know what to expect from this but it was worth a try.

'My son was 21 and died of natural causes, his autopsy came back undetermined. He is proof that there are no guarantees in life. Hug your children kiss them. Tell them you love them every single day.'

Jesse's sister, Nichole, wrote on 
Facebook: 'I would rather have Jesse here than to get the attention on 
social media. But this viral video going out and seeing and hearing 
everyone do these amazing things for my family and I makes it really 
seem like he isn't that far away.'

Facebook spokesman Jonathan Thaw told Pix11 the video would be ready by the end of the week, adding: 'We have people working on it now.'

The social network revealed the new feature, 'A Look Back,' on Tuesday. The customized video shows the year a user joined along with a selection of the most-liked photos and messages, backed by instrumental music.
