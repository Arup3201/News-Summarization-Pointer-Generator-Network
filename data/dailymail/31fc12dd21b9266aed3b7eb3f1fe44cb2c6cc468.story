The Wisconsin woman who lost all of her three young daughters when her ex-husband murdered them out of revenge has remarried, and is expecting a new child.

Jennifer Peterson's ex-husband Aaron Schaffhausen had come over to her house for an unsupervised visit In July 2012 with the daughters Amara, 11, Sophie, 8, and Cecilia, 5.

He called two hours later saying: 'you can come home now, I killed the kids'. Schaffhausen was sentenced to three consecutive  life sentences a year later.

Eighteen months after the brutal triple-murder Peterson is still pained by her daughters' loss, but is getting by with the support of her new husband Matthew and the business of getting ready for a new baby. Mrs Peterson is currently seven months pregnant. 

'The key to much of my life is this balancing dual emotions, having to always be a little sad and a little happy at the same time,' Mrs Peterson told KTSP. 'It definitely helps in my process of trying to keep going, to bring some more love back into this world.'

Mrs Peterson has a positive outlook considering all of the dark she's seen since July 10, 2012, when her ex texted her for permission to have an unscheduled visit with their daughters.

She
 consented but said he had to be gone before she got home because she 
didn't want to see him. The girls' baby sitter told investigators the 
children were excited when he arrived, and the sitter left.

He called his ex-wife, Jessica Schaffhausen, about two hours later, saying: 'You can come home now, I killed the kids.'

Police
 arrived to find the girls lying in their beds, their throats slit and 
their blankets pulled up to their necks. White T-shirts were tied around
 their necks. Cecilia's body also showed signs of strangulation.

During his trial last year, Schaffhausen tried to excuse his actions with an insanity plea.

Trial
 testimony showed that in the months leading up to the killings, 
Schaffhausen told several people he had thoughts of killing his 
daughters.

His ex-wife 
testified that in March 2012, he called her from Minot, North Dakota â€” 
where he was working â€” and told her he 'wanted to drive down there and 
tie me up and make me pick which child he killed and make me watch while
 he killed them.'

He also called his ex-wife repeatedly, sometimes up to 30 times a day, and threatened to kill the man she was dating.

Schaffhausen
 didn't testify at his trial. His defense attorney argued at trial that 
Schaffhausen has a rare mental disorder rooted in deep dependency on his
 ex-wife, and believed the only way he could 'solve' his problem was to 
commit suicide or homicide.

The jury rejected his insanity defense.

'This is a vicious, aggravated crime,' St Croix County Circuit Judge Howard Cameron said before handing down the sentence last July.

The judge chose consecutive life sentences to send a message that 'each child is so important.'

Now that her ex-husband is safely behind bars, Mrs Peterson is finding ways to keep her daughter's memories alive while also moving on.

She is currently working to build Tri-Angels Playground, a public space to honor her daughters.

Remembered: Mrs Peterson is now working on building a park to memorialize her daughters

'Something people count interact with and make their own memories, and in that way, keep my girls' memories alive,' she said.

The project costs $550,00 to build and she's only raised $247,000 so she's asking for more donations. Bremer Bank has agreed to match donation up to $50,000 and she hopes to open the park in the spring or summer of next year.

'I miss the girls still a lot,' Peterson said. 'That's a pain I think I'll always carry. But I try to do it in a way that would make them proud of me, in much the way I would want them to carry on if they'd lost me.'
