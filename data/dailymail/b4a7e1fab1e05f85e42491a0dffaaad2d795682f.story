Police warrants used to seize computer hard drives from the mansion of a suspected kingpin of an Internet piracy ring were illegal, a judge ruled today.

Seventy officers raided the New Zealand mansion of Megaupload.com boss Kim Dotcom - also known as Kim Schmitz - in January as part of an investigation of his website spearheaded by the FBI in the U.S.

Dotcom was one of four men arrested during the operation.

He is accused of being the ringleader of a group that 
netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films 
and other copyrighted content without authorisation. Dotcom's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage.

But a New Zealand judge today found 
the warrants used in the seizure of property from Dotcom's mansion near 
Auckland were illegal.

Justice
Helen Winkelmann ruled that moves by the FBI to copy data from Dotcom's
computer and take it offshore were also unlawful.

She told the hearing: 'The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related.

'Indeed they fell well short of that. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.'

In
response, New Zealand's police said in a statement that they are 
considering the judgement and are in discussions with Crown Law 'to 
determine what further action might be required'.

Police said no further comment would be made until that process is complete.

Dotcom
is on bail in New Zealand, fighting attempts by U.S. authorities 
seeking to extradite him on charges of copyright theft and money 
laundering. An extradition hearing is set for August.

Television
New Zealand quoted a spokesman for Dotcom as saying he is 'pleased' but
would not be making any further comment on the court decision as 
appeals are likely.

Lawyers
representing the U.S. government said the ruling had come as 'no 
surprise' and that their legal team would be discussing options, 
including whether an appeal will be lodged.

During
the January raid, armed officers, backed by helicopters, cut Dotcom out
of a safe room he had barricaded himself in within the sprawling 
country estate, reputedly New Zealand's most expensive home.

Millions of dollars in assets were seized or frozen, including almost 20 luxury vehicles, dozens of computers and art works.

Before
it was shut down in January, Megaupload was one of the world's most 
popular websites, where millions of users stored data, either for free 
or by paying for premium service.

Warning: Users trying to access Megaupload get this message from the FBI

Authorities say Megaupload.com and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $500million.

U.S.
lawyers for Megaupload have also argued that American federal 
authorities cannot charge the company with criminal behaviour because it
is Hong Kong-based, and also that no papers have ever been formally 
served.

Earlier this week, 
the company hosting the frozen data of millions of users of the file 
sharing site said their bill must be paid or they be allowed to delete 
the data.

Carpathia Hosting said it is using more than 1,100 servers to store the 25million gigabytes of the website's data - it has been  inaccessible since the site was seized by the FBI.

The
company filed an emergency motion in a U.S. federal court in Virginia 
seeking protection from the expense of hosting the data of up to 
66million users.

The
Virginia-based company said it is paying $9,000 (£5,700) a day to host 
the data, which works out to more than $500,000 (£316,600) since 
January.
