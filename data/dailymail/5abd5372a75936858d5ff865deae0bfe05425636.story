A Victorian man has made a full-admission to the shooting deaths of three of his neighbours, telling 000 operators 'I just killed three people', a court heard.

Ian Francis Jamieson, 63, has been charged with three counts of murder on Thursday night, after the shooting deaths of three members of the same family in a small Victorian town.

Peter Lockhart, 78, his wife Mary Lockhart, 75, and Mrs Lockhart's son, 48-year-old Greg Holmes, were killed in the incident on Wednesday night. 

A barefoot Jamieson faced an out-of-sessions hearing at Bendigo police station at about 10pm and was remanded in custody. 

Detective Sen-Constable Jason Wallace told the court that during police interviews Jamieson made 'full admissions' to the three murders, according to Herald Sun.

The court heard that when Jamieson called 000 on Wednesday night, he 'said he had killed three people'.

It was also confirmed that victim Greg Holmes had tried to reach help, calling police at 8.20pm on Wednesday night to report the argument with Jamieson, according to Herald Sun.

Two officers arrived at the Mulga Ridge Road property and were told by nearby campers that someone had been heard calling out for help.

Det-Sen-Constable Wallace told the court that the officers were unable to find Mr Holmes but his ringing phone led them to his body in a paddock. 

After locating Mr Holmes' body, the officers heard gunshots from an adjoining property across the road.

Given the circumstances, the officers retreated from the scene to call for back up, Superintendent Graham Kent explained.

A four hour siege ensued, with police able to communite with Jamieson on the phone, before he peacefully surrendered himself.

A second body was found in a driveway and the third at the rear entrance to a home. 

The individuals were neighbours in the rural town, a small settlement called Logan, 2km from Wedderburn, in north west Victoria. 

Police and neighbours allege an ongoing but minor dispute about farming practices is the possible reason behind the murders. 

Detective Superintendent Peter De Santo said the disagreement between the neighbours had escalated out of the blue.

'There is some history of minor disputes in the past and when I say minor, at the very bottom end of disputes between neighbours,' he told reporters on Thursday.

'It's just very hard to fathom how this has all unfolded.'

Local Geoff Maxwell was aware of the fight, but told AAP, 'nobody ever dreamt it would be so serious'.  

Three family members have died after they were allegedly shot at Wedderburn near Bendigo

Officers were called to a rural property at 8.30pm (AEDT) on Wednesday following reports of gunshots 

Police said the firearms involved in the incident were registered and had recently been inspected.

There was no history of violence, major disputes or ongoing assaults between the neighbours, he said.

Loddon Shire mayor Gavan Holt said he understood the dispute was about farming.

'My information is that some time ago, a couple of years ago, they had a minor dispute - not a major issue and not a family matter – but a small disagreement over farming practices,' Mr Holt told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm being told that this was a long-running neighbourhood dispute over matters occurring on land which has escalated far beyond where it should have gone,' he said. 

He said the victims were very well know in the 1000-person town, with Mr Lockhart part of a five-generation farming family in the district.

The incident took place in a small town more than 200km north-west of Melbourne

Mr Lockhart, a retired cereals and sheep farmer, lived on the property with his wife who was also killed.

Mr Holmes, his stepson, lived on a house on an adjoining property.

Mr Holt said the Lockharts and the man in custody all have other children with families  who live in Wedderburn, he added.

Mr Holt said the community would support each other through the tragedy.

'All we can do is say we are there for you,' he said.

'There's lives wrecked here and it's our job to just be there for them in any way we can.' 

A local resident confirmed that 'Peter and Mary have been in town their whole lives.' 

Logan resident Rosie Camilleri said it was a big shock.

'It's a pretty quiet town here. Everyone gets along pretty well. It must've been something that was brewing for a while.' 

Jamieson will appear in Bendigo Magistrates Court on Friday.
