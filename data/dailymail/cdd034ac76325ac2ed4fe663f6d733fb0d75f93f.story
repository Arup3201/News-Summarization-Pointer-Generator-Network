A 14-year-old Florida boy was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a middle school bathroom Wednesday night.

According to Seminole County Sheriff's Office, the child's mother drove to Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary to pick up her son at around 5pm, but could not find him.

The boy's family then set out scouring the neighborhood for him, but to no avail. Two hours later, the 14-year-old was reported missing to police.

Tragic find: A 14-year-old boy attending Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary, Florida, was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a bathroom stall on campus 

Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Greenwood Lakes Middle School to search the campus, where they eventually came upon the missing boy, who was found in a men's room stall with a bullet wound to the head.

The grisly discovery was made four hours after the middle-schooler was reported missing by his mother, WESH-TV reported. 

Greenwood Lakes Principal Debra Abbott released a statement on the school’s website and Facebook page announcing the student’s death.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the parents and family of the student as they deal with this tremendous personal loss.

‘Grief Counselors will be available on-site for students and staff beginning first thing this morning and will remain for as long as necessary,’ the open letter read.

Police are now trying to determine how the teenager got his hands on a firearm. His name has not been released to the public.

Channel 9 reported that it has been suggested that the boy might have been bullied, but the investigation into a possible motive is ongoing.

Classes resumed as normal Thursday, but the school canceled its open house scheduled for the evening, along with all after-school activities.

Parent Nadine Weaver told Orlando Sentinel that after hearing the tragic news of the boy’s death this morning, she rushed to Greenwood Lakes and pulled her daughter from class early.

‘I hate for her to miss another day of school but I just can't help it,’ Weaver said. ‘It could be someone that she knows personally, and how could I be at home [and] leave her here, just not knowing.’
