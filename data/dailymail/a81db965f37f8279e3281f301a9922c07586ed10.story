A stag or hen do is known as the last night of freedom before committing to someone for the rest of your life - and it seems that some Brits really take advantage of that.

New research reveals that a third of stags and hens cheat on their betrothed during their final night of freedom.

Worse still, you'll probably never find out because 92 per cent of those who cheated said that they'd kept this from their partner.

Are YOU guilty? A new survey has revealed that a third of Brits cheat on their future wife or husband on their stag or hen do

Of these, three quarters (74 per cent) 
said that they were worried their partner would find out about their 
antics through friends or family who had attended their pre-nuptial 
celebrations.

An honest 8 per cent revealed that they'd confessed to their partners after the event.

Those who did cheat were 
asked to identify the reasons behind their infidelity with 'I was drunk and things got out of control' being the top reason with 76 per cent of the vote.

Blame it on the alcohol: The top reason for unfaithful behaviour was revealed to be: 'I was drunk and things got out of control'

The other reasons were: 'I had cold feet and felt stressed about the wedding', 'I wanted to enjoy my last chance of freedom' , 'I had a "hall pass" e.g. my partner agreed we could have a fling on our stag and hen dos, and 'I was pressurised by other attendees of the stag or hen do'.

All respondents who had been unfaithful were then questioned on whether their stag/hen took place in the UK or abroad, with 67 per cent of unfaithful stags and hens holding their parties abroad and only 33 per cent straying while partying at home in the UK.

Finally, 
all respondents were asked whether strip clubs or strippers had 
been part of their evening, with 62 per cent revealing their parties had
 featured strippers or strip clubs, with the average expenditure totalling £120 per person.

When
 the results were broken down further, it became apparent that there was
 a conclusive gender gap with 78 per cent of strip club attendees being male and 
22 per cent female.

A spokesperson for vouchercloud, who commissioned the survey, said:
 'I think it’s no secret that when full of alcohol and banter, things 
can get out of hand on these events and one of these things is the issue
 of cheating. 

'Many
 people see this as their chance for a final fling before finally 
settling down. We were surprised to see that a good two thirds of the 
country remain faithful even in the excitement of their celebration.

'Concerning
 the findings on strip clubs, it seems that those who partake in these 
are obviously well paid or manage their finances pretty well! An average
 spend of £120 per person is a large chunk of money from the pre-nuptial
 party budget.

'Let’s hope it was worth it, and not something they regretted the next morning when they woke up with a sore head!'

Gender divide: 62 per cent of Brits revealed that their parties had featured strippers or strip clubs, with the average expenditure totalling £120 per person - and men are the most likely to visit a strip club
