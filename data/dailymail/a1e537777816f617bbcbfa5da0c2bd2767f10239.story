Luis Suarez and Martin Skrtel appeared to come to blows in a Liverpool training session on Friday, in perhaps the first sign that there is trouble in Merseyside paradise.

The club are nearing their first Premier League title, and would take a major step towards it with a win against Chelsea on Sunday.

But there seemed to be a clash between two of their key players at Melwood, with others stepping in to break it up.

Shove: Luis Suarez pushes team-mate Martin Skrtel in a Liverpool training session on Friday

Close up: The Liverpool players were playing a game of head and foot volleyball when the incident took place

Lead up: Players are seen laughing at Skrtel doing imitations, but Suarez is seen scowling at the Slovakian

Row: The striker clenches his fist towards the defender at Melwood

Tempers fray: An eye witness said that Skrtel cheated in the game and Suarez wasn't impressed

During a game of head and foot volleyball, players were laughing as Skrtel joked around.

One man who looks to have taken offence though is Suarez, who is seen scowling at the Slovakian centre-back.

Suarez then seems to clench his fists and raise his arms at Skrtel, and is backed up by team-mates Philippe Coutinho and Lucas.

Competitive: The game continued and an eye-witness said that Suarez's team later won the point

Hugs: Players laugh and joke about the incident, but Suarez and Skrtel are still kept apart

Blow: Brendan Rodgers is spotted in the background while Suarez still seems to be arguing his case

An eye-witness suggested Skrtel seemed to be mucking about which amused his team-mates, but not Suarez

He used his arm to keep the ball in play, a move which Suarez and Philippe Coutino objected. The former leaned over the net to push Skrtel.

Manager Brendan Rodgers stepped in to calm the escalating tension and Suarez's team was awarded the point. Matters seemed calm soon after.

Heated: Philippe Coutinho and other South Americans and Spaniards have Suarez's back

No anxiety: Brendan Rodgers had claimed that his players were loving his life at the top

The incident could suggest a 
contradiction to Rodgers' quotes from last week, insisting there was no 
anxiety about the title race at the club.

'I'm enjoying being top of the league,' he said. 'It is absolutely wonderful. There is no pressure with it.

'People say, "You must not sleep at night". I've never slept better. It's absolutely great, it's why we work.

'I
 see the joy in the players and in their training - and there is no 
anxiety. It's good to be involved in. The only way you get the 
experience is by going through it - win or lose.

'Suarez is a brilliant talent. I think the supporters have seen him mature over the course of the last season.'
