Four would-be cowboys have brought the wild-west to Brazil with their brazen robberies on horseback.

The underage buckaroos, said to be between 13 and 16 years old, were caught on security cameras mugging two terrified women of their purses and shopping in the town of Fortaleza, north east Brazi

The two elderly victims, who have just come out of the supermarket with their shopping bags, are seen cowering on the pavement and trying to run backwards as a horse trots around the corner with an accomplice running on foot behind. 

Approach: The robbers turn up on their horses and come across an elderly woman standing in the doorway

Reaction: Another women follows out of the door and they spot the teenagers trotting towards them

As the women panic they drop their shopping and, while one manages to escape, the horse-back rider traps the other using his horse to herd her to the wall. Petrified, the woman gives up her goods, shoving the bags into the outstretched arms of the bandit and runs for her life.

The side-kick gathers up the loot, leaving much of it behind on the floor, then the scramble is on to saddle-up and get-away with the booty. But first attempts to make a ‘giddy-up’ escape are comical, as the accomplice is a bit of a handicap. He clumsily clambers onto the horse, slipping off several times and nearly dismounts the rider off the bronco.

Raising an arm as if they've won the Epsom Derby, the horsemen make their get-away at a slow canter.

Run! One of the women manages to escape by scrambling across the pavement to the other side of the road

Panic: One of the women drops their bags on the pavement and one of the thieves reaches down to pick it up

Tussle: The remaining woman tries to save her shopping but the robber has a stronger grasp

Minutes earlier, the security cameras had captured the start of the incident, showing the would-be posse of four buffalo bills on two mules plodding menacingly towards the two female shoppers.

Deyse Herbster, a housewife, who lives nearby saw the hold-up and said: 'I thought it was a joke at first with the boys on their horses just approaching the women for a laugh. But when I heard the women scream for help I realised it was serious.'

According to locals, this is not the first time that the brazen bandits have attacked passers-by.

Going: The robbers begin their getaway, but have left some of the stolen shopping lying on the pavement

Gone: The robbers gallop down the road with the stolen handbags

'This has been happening for a while and they still haven’t been caught,' said one local, who didn’t want to be named.

'I hardly go out anymore because I’m so afraid,' said housewife, Tassila Maria Menezes de Castro.

'When I do go out, I can’t see a horse without feeling scared.'

Police say they are still looking to roundup the culprits.

Fortaleza’s military police officer, Francisco Luciano Coelho said: 'You can be sure that once we identify who they are they will be put in jail.

Some of the town's residents have, however, found the episodes somewhat funny and are now calling the shopping  ‘rustlers’  junior Zorro bandits.
