Comedian Jim Davidson has been criticised by anti-racism campaigners after he described part of his old stand-up routine as 'cartoon racism'

Matthew Collins, of anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, however has criticised Mr Davidson for the comments and told The Mirror: 'No racism is ever acceptable.'

In the podcast, Mr Davidson, 60, tells fellow comedian Richard Digance: 'There was cartoon racism in them days. It was the type of stuff you'd do in front of a load of black people.'

He goes on to say: 'I thought that the West Indian accent - especially Chalky White - was a vehicle to help us all really.

'I don't want to sound like a vicar and I'm certainly not apologising, but it was picking on one stupid, black West Indian accent and always making this guy loveable and the winner.'

He later adds: 'He sometimes lost, but he lost with great style.'

Mr
 Davidson also said using the word 'poof' to describe gay men can 
be acceptable as 'sometimes they like to be called poofs and sometimes 
they don't'.

He added: 'Sometimes they have a laugh with themselves and other times they don't. It's all in the protected species act nowadays.'

Mr Davidson was axed from Hell's Kitchen in 2007 after making homophobic comments in which he branded gay men 'shirtlifters'.

On Sunday evening's episode of Celebrity Big Brother, Mr Davidson revealed the true extent of his past cocaine addiction while taking part in the first task of the series - Building Block of Celebrity, which saw each celebrity tell stories from their lives.

He said: ‘My life has always been in excess, I’ve always drank to what my job allowed me to do and eventually I found myself falling foul of the old Columbian marching powder, I didn’t know what to do.'

He continued: ‘I had to make a difficult choice. I crawled from the pub to my ex wife’s bed and said "if you don’t help me now I am going to die". She took me to somewhere, and I met up with a guy…it was me a guy and a few other people and a bible.

‘Even though I still drink a lot, I drink in a different way now. And I thank God everyday; I don’t go near any of the strong drugs. With the help of love from people and God I’ve overcome those demons.’
