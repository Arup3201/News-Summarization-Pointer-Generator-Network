A California gym became a robotic warzone yesterday as drones battled it out in an annual engineering contest.

The competition involved six teams of engineering students who were each given $800 (£480) to create machines that could fly or drive their way to victory.

Organised by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), this year’s theme was ‘Raiders of the Lost Can.’

Students had to manoeuvre their robots on the basketball court inside Brown Gymnasium.

The aim was to collect an empty soup can and get it to as close to the top a wooden hill after four-minute rounds.

They also had to prevent or obstruct the other team’s robot from reaching the platform.

According to the rules, the robots could be defensive but should not be designed to destroy the opposing teams’ machines.

The winners were a team dubbed ‘40 Piece Chicken McNuggets’ who created two identical rovers that drove instead of flew.

In the final round, it came down to the McNuggets and a team called the Cunning Stunts, which used their budget to make three roving robots as well as one flying design.

‘This is where rubber meets the road,’ said Carl Ruoff, instructor of ME72: Engineering Design Laboratory told Pasadena Star-News.

Six teams of mechanical engineering majors are competing as part of a final project and core requirement, in which their robotic vehicles must climb or fly to get empty soup cans into an elevated five-foot target platform, while preventing competitor robots from doing the same

‘It’s all very practical,’ Mr Ruoff said. ‘You don’t want engineers making rockets that go into the ocean instead of into orbit.’

The ‘Soup Nazis’, a team based on the Seinfeld TV show, created a flying quadcopter named Elaine and a tank named Kramer.

Meanwhile, a group called 'Team Avengers' took a defensive strategy with rovers named Iron Man and Hulk that could rundown opponents.

Known as ME-72, the engineering design contest is the final project and core requirement for all Caltech Mechanical Engineering majors.
