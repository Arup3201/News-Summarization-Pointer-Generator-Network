One couple have the magic moment they became engaged captured for posterity after a romantic father-to-be went down on one knee during a professional photo shoot.   

Matt Beards, 32, stunned his pregnant partner Kirsty Leneveu by popping the question while they posed for a photographer who reeled off a sequence of frames capturing her saying 'yes'.

He had arranged for the pictures to be taken as birthday present but mid-way through the shoot, he suddenly got down on one knee and proposed.

Kirsty, 23, who is seven-months pregnant with their first child, said: 'I was posing for a regular photo, but when I looked round Matt was down on one knee. The ring was so big there was no way I could say no.

'The photographer was just as 
surprised as me but carried on taking pictures and now we have a 
wonderful memory captured on film forever.'

She added: 'I thought I was going to be enjoying a normal birthday, but ended up getting the best present I have ever had. When he proposed I was completely overwhelmed.

'We've been together for two years and always knew we wanted to get married one day but I never expected him to propose like he did. It's been an agonising wait, and there were times when I was wondering will it be today?

'When he finally did ask I just wasn't expecting it at all.' Matt, a police officer, arranged the surprise proposal on Kirsty's 23rd birthday on March 18.

He said: 'I knew what the answer would be because we've talked about getting married so much, but I was worried about the way it would come across. I definitely wanted to get it right.

'I chose the shoot because I thought her mind would be on other things, and of course the fact we could get a picture there and then buy it.

'I thought about waiting until our son was born, but was glad I chose her birthday because she was absolutely gobsmacked.'

The couple, from Evesham, Worcs, plan to tie the knot later this year. Photographer Gary Maxwell, who runs the studio in Leamington Spa, where the couple got engaged, said: 'What started off as a more glamorous couple's makeover session was quickly turned into a proposal which I was not expecting at all. 'I'm just glad I captured the moment because you really only get one shot at that but I was glad the pictures came out well.'
