This is the horrifying moment that a mother discovered her seven-year-old daughter had been shot dead and son, nine, seriously injured by her estranged husband before he committed suicide.

The bodies of Abigail Benway and her father Daryl, 41, were discovered in the master bedroom of the family home by a relative on Saturday evening.

Nine-year-old Owen was taken to hospital in serious condition after being shot in the head.

When the children's mother
Kelleen Benway arrived at the house in Oxford, Massachusetts she was arrested by police
officers down to confusion over who was responsible for the 
shooting. She was later released and was at her son's bedside in UMass Memorial Children's Medical Center.

Mrs Benway had returned home after the shootings, unaware of what had happened and found a swarm of police cruisers and television crews.

Worcester District Attorney Joseph D 
Early Jr said that he would not speculate on a motive but that Mr 
Benway and his wife separated about a month ago.

Neighbors of the pair confirmed that Mrs Benway, known to some as Kelly, had been looking for a new place to live.

'It doesn’t get much worse than this,' said Mr Early.

'It’s horrible. It’s a horrible scene.'

The Benways lived on the second 
floor of the residence and Mr Benway's brother Shawn apparently occupied
the first floor with his wife and the brothers' mother.

Shawn Benway called 911 after hearing the shots come from upstairs.

While
police would not divulge the type of gun used in the shooting, they did
confirm that Mr Benway's license had expired in 1999.

No restraining orders had been filed against Daryl Benway and he had no criminal record, the DA said.

Mrs Benway was accompanied to hospital by her 25-year-old daughter Nickolefrom a previous marriage.

Neighors described Mr Benway as an 
overweight man who had a career in information technology.

According 
to his Facebook page, he worked at TJX Companies and attended Oxford High
School.

'I don’t understand how you can do something like that,' said neighbor John Forand.

Other's wrote on Mr Benway's Facebook page to express their shock and disbelief.

'I
wished you would have called me I can’t believe this when we talked the
other day everything seemed kool I’m gonna miss you,' wrote one.

Others
simply asked:'Why?'
