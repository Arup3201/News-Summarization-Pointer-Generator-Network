A NASA space craft which helped paved the way putting man on the moon encountered a issue of a far more earthly kind this week when it was given a parking ticket in downtown Boston.

Traffic officers were unhappy at the time it was taking for the two tonne 1960s Gemini space capsule to be delivered to RR Auction saleroom and handed auctioneer Bobby Livingston a fine.

The capsule - which is considered a piece of space history, having been used in the testing of highly dangerous missions that resulted in the first ever space walks - is due to go on sale at the auction house tomorrow with a $50,000 asking price.

Mr Livingston said was taking delivery of the enormous capsule, part of NASA's ground-breaking Project Gemini space missions, when he was handed the fine.

At more than nine feet tall, weighing two tonnes and spacious enough to fit two people, prospective bidders will have to make sure they have plenty of room to store the capsule before splashing out.

The Gemini missions paved the way for putting man on the moon with the Apollo space programme by testing longer space flights and perfecting methods of re-entry and landing.

Following the success of Apollo in the late 1960s NASA turned their attention to the space shuttle programme which resulted in the building of the International Space Station.

Much of the redundant equipment from previous missions was sold off in the 1970s to create space for the new technologies to be developed and tested.

Describing the history of the capsule, one of seven made for the Gemini project, Mr Livingston said that after the NASA clear out the capsule was acquired along with a number of items by a former employee named Charles Bell

When Mr Bell died in 2000 the capsule was discovered rotting among his vast collection of space junk in his back garden

The capsule will go under the hammer at Mr Livingston's RR Auction saleroom in Boston, Massachusetts, for $50,000 - around £35,000.

Mr Livingston, president of RR Auction, said: 'These capsules were used by NASA to test how the spacecraft would react on landing.

'Seven were made in total for the Mercury space missions, the second manned space flight NASA conducted,' he added.

'When NASA started developing the space shuttle following the Apollo missions they needed space so they had a massive clear-out of equipment that was by that point redundant,' he went on to say.

Project Gemini was NASA's second human spaceflight program, with ten manned flights occurring between 1965 and 1966. Similar in design to the Mercury capsule but much larger, the new Gemini spacecraft was designed to carry two astronauts into Earth orbit to test long-duration flight, rendezvous and docking and other technologies needed for later journies to the moon

Mason after the successful completion of their Gemini VIII mission in March 16, 1966. Three years later Armstrong was a member of the three man crew on board Apollo 11 and became the first human ever to walk on the surface of the moon

Describing the history of the capsule, one of seven made for the Gemini project, Mr Livingston said that after the NASA clear out the capsule was acquired along with a number of items by a former employee  named Charles Bell.

When Mr Bell died in 2000 the capsule was discovered rotting among his vast collection of space junk. It was bought by the current owner who set about restoring the capsule to its former glory.

'It is in incredible piece of space history but any prospective buyer will have to have the space to house it - it's 9ft tall and weighs 2.5 tonnes,' Mr Livingston said.

'There is a real market for memorabilia from the early days of space exploration, especially capsules such as this - they're pretty rare,' he added.

'It would be a perfect tourist attraction for an institution but we've also had interest from private collectors... Anyone who buys this capsule will have to make sure they can home it - it's huge,' Mr Livingston went on to say.

The Gemini missions paved the way for putting man on the moon with the Apollo space programme by testing longer space flights and perfecting methods of re-entry and landing

Project Gemini was launched on January 3, 1962. It followed on from NASA's Mercury projects which put man into space and allowed NASA to trial longer flights deeper into space.

Astronauts were able to test methods of manoeuvring and docking with other space craft and perfect ways of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

Famous astronauts who flew on the Gemini missions include Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first humans ever to land on the moon, and Jim Lovell, commander of Apollo 13.

The auction will be held tomorrow.
