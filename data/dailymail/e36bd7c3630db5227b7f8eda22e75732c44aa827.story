Pensioner Peter Sheath water skis at breakneck speeds twice a week despite being registered blind.

The 74-year-old took up the dangerous sport 25 years ago and has loved it ever since.

Despite being registered as blind since the age of 30, he doesn't consider himself disabled and even competed in the sport for some time.

He no longer performs daring tricks and 
jumps like he used to, such as 360 degree turns, but still gets on to 
the water as often as possible.

Peter enjoys the freedom of the water sport as it provides him with a feeling of independence.

He rarely gets nervous or scared about doing it and says he will carry on water skiing as long as he is fit and healthy.

The father-of-two, from Southampton, Hants, said: 'I'd always been interested in boats so my friend and I bought a power boat between us.

'He'd done waterskiing before so we rigged up the boat so he could do it but then I thought 'if he can do it, I'll have a go'.

'I love waterskiing because to a certain degree you're independent and you can do things able-bodied people can do.

'You're out there enjoying yourself with the wind blowing through your hair - I've always liked the freedom.

'I think in some ways being blind helps because the instant visual fear factor is removed. I never feel scared.'

Peter's sight loss was inherited - his grandfather had gone blind at 30 and Peter always knew he might be affected.

He noticed problems with his vision when he was around 15 and his sight loss got progressively worse.

The pensioner says he adapted well to losing his sight, perhaps because it went gradually, and can still tell the difference between light and dark.

He was registered blind in 1968 but was able to continue in employment as a mechanic with the help of workmates.

He still does lots of DIY around his home, which he shares with his wife, Mary, and his guide dog, Innes.

Peter adds that while many people struggle to get onto their feet on the water skis, he took to the sport readily.

The 74-year-old added: 'My wife and daughter do worry about me but you have to live your life.

'You could hurt yourself tripping up in the street on your way to the shop - but I've never had any broken bones.

'I don't really feel like I've got a disability - I always try to do things for myself.'

At the age of 55, Peter started competing in open age group competitions for disabled people.

He beat people much younger than him during his competitive days to claim an array of medals.

He even set a world record for jumping a distance of 40ft.

He added: 'If you want to do something, do it - with waterskiing it doesn't matter what disability you have, there's always a way of getting you onto the water.

'As long as I'm fit and healthy I will carry on waterskiing for the foreseeable future.'
