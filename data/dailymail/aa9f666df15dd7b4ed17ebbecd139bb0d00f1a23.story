Property prices in London are soaring beyond the means of many would-be homeowners.

But if you are willing to look further afield, you could become lord of a magnificent country manor for a fraction of the price of a simple apartment in the capital. Estate agents Foxtons say the average price of a two-bedroom flat in the very heart of London has now risen to almost £1.1million.

A typical example in Kensington - not far from Hyde Park - boasts just one reception room and a bathroom, in comparison to the roomy, remote locations on offer outside of the capital.

Yet if you don’t need to commute, you could buy a substantial historic home in Shropshire or Dorset for about half that price. Here is our pick of some of the properties currently available...

West Yorkshire: If you like people, the 1830s-built High Gables outside Leeds has eight bedrooms, ideal for guests. If you don't, it's surrounded by trees at the end of its own gravel drive, so you can remain a recluse. But beware: the decor is more dated than a Bruce Forsyth joke

Suffolk: A Victorian church in the village of Culford Heath has been converted into a three-bedroom home, with stained-glass windows intact.  And what home is complete without double cart lodge, as this one boasts?

Berwickshire: Man the battlements. The five-bedroom Georgian-built Stoneshiel Hall near Berwick-upon-Tweed has a distinctive crenellated roof. It's also near to the beach... but it is a Scottish beach, so take your cagoule.

Worcestershire: With eight bedrooms, Pickersleigh Court could house several adults... or several million woodworm if you don't keep the timber frames treated. A Malvern landmark, dating from the 15th Century, it has a music room, drawing room, and even a formal rose  garden. The adjoining paddock has planning permission for four detached houses, should it not yet be quite big enough for you

Dorset: If you're prepared to tackle the upkeep of a thatched roof, this picture-postcard 1800s cottage (originally built as a pair) has four bedrooms and more charm than you could want. It's not all old, though, as there's a newly refurbished conservatory with underfloor heating

Shropshire: More property, vicar? Originally dating from 1588, this  three-bedroom house was once the village vicarage for Lydbury North - and it boasts barns, a stable block and a vegetable and fruit garden. There's also a small orchard

Berwickshire: If you fancy yourself as the next Basil Fawlty, this 1757-built, seven-bedroom country house eight miles from Berwick-upon-Tweed could be converted into a guest house. It comes with an acre of land and great views, too.

Kensington: Instead of any of the above rural gems, a two-bedroom flat in this building not far from Hyde Park, Central London, would set you back £1.1million

Argyll and Bute: Something of a commute from anywhere - it's 19 miles to the nearest station (Oban) then three hours to Glasgow - the 16th Century Kilmartin Castle, which has three bedrooms and two towers, was once owned by the Campbell clan

East Yorkshire: A special bargain, this seven-bedroom Edwardian house  in Elloughton Dale comes with eight acres, a billiard room and an orangery. Nine months ago it was on the market for £1.7million - now agents are asking 'just' £950,000

Warning: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the UK must build new houses to avoid boom and bust

The 
Governor of the Bank of England has issued a stark warning that the 
booming housing market is now the biggest single threat to the economy –
 and said that the country must build more houses if it wants to avoid 
further catastrophic boom-and-bust cycles.

Mark
 Carney said not enough homes were being constructed to meet demand, and
 that there were signs that an increasing number of buyers were 
beginning to borrow heavily again.

His warning comes as house  prices soar in some parts of Britain – although in other areas they remain stagnant.

Mr
 Carney said: ‘The biggest  risk to financial stability, and therefore 
to the durability of the expansion – those risks centre in the housing 
market, and that’s why we are focused on that.’

Contrasting
 Britain with his native Canada, he added: ‘The issues around the 
housing market in  the UK… [are] that there are not sufficient houses 
built in the UK.

‘[There
 are] half as many people in Canada as in the UK, [but] twice as many 
houses are built in Canada every year than in the UK.’

Official
 figures show 112,000 homes were constructed in England in the 12 months
 to March and that the number of new properties being started is rising.
 But the figure is still far below the 177,000 houses built in 2007.

Mr
 Carney – who issued the warning in an interview with Sky News’s Dermot 
Murnaghan, to be broadcast today – also revealed there was a risk that 
home buyers are borrowing heavily once again, with signs that loans of 
four times a person’s salary or more were starting to increase.

‘We
 don’t want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt 
individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium 
term,’ he said.

‘We
 would be concerned if there were rapid increases in high  loan-to-value
 mortgages across the banks... we’ve seen that creeping  up and it’s 
something that we are watching closely.’

The
 Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per 
cent, despite pleas from some economists that action is needed to calm 
the bubble emerging in some regions.

Last
 week, Mr Carney said the Bank judged the economy was still fragile and 
indicated rate rises were unlikely in  the near future. When they came 
they would be ‘limited’: ‘The recovery is neither balanced nor 
sustainable,’ he said.

The Bank is widely expected to use tools other than an interest- rate rise to stem excessive borrowing.

Under
 new powers granted to it as part of an overhaul of financial 
regulation, it could require banks to set aside more capital reserves 
against home loans or tighten rules on lending.

The
 Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, which is chaired by the Governor and
 is in charge of the stability of the financial system, is expected to 
outline how it might use those powers next month.

Estate agents are forcing desperate buyers to stump up thousands of pounds in unexpected fees to secure a home in Britain’s increasingly heated property market.

A probe has now been launched into the ‘borderline illegal’, but increasingly widespread, practice.

Typically levied at two to 2.5 per cent of the sale price, the charge is paid by buyers who win a ‘sealed bid’ tender process, and means  the agent is making money from both buyer and seller.

Property Ombudsman Christopher Hamer said he was ‘very concerned’ over the practice, which is most common in the hotspots of the South East.

He told The Mail on Sunday  he was seeking legal advice, adding: ‘The agents’ clear legal obligations are to the seller and entering into a contract with prospective buyers may well compromise that, and be seen as a conflict of interest.’

HomeOwners Alliance chief Paula Higgins said: ‘It allows the agents  to cream even more money from both sides at a time when houses are practically selling themselves.’

But agents who impose the fees insist they are acting in a legal and transparent way which brings more buyers to the market.

The entire South Devon hamlet of Bantham is going on the market on Friday, complete with beach, boathouses, golf course and pub.

All 728 acres have been owned by the same family for generations, and will have an asking price of £10million.

The
 sleepy settlement - which has one pub and and a village shop - was 
bought up by a military commander in 1922, and most residents rent their
 properties.

And now - thanks to a dispute over a food van - its 21 homes and other properties will be sold to the highest bidder.

When
 Gillian Goddard - one of the estate's five directors - allowed a 
'gastrobus' to sell food and drink to visitors, she was deluged by 
complaints from locals attacking her act of 'commercialisation'.

This, according to The Times,
 caused her to change her mind about bequeathing the estate to the 
visitors, and she amended her will to demand the village be put on the 
market.

She 
died in November, triggering the sale, which is being run by estate 
agents Strutt and Parker. If no single buyer emerges, they intend to 
split the village into six separate lots.

The prospect of a new landlord has alarmed residents - many of whom rent their homes.

Rod
 Seymour, the landlord of the Sloop Inn pub in the hamlet, said: 'The 
same families have lived here for generations. We came here five years 
ago and since then only one property has been sold.'

Another
 said: 'People are nervous, of course they are. We’re worried that 
someone from London will see an ‘opportunity’. They’ll kick the tenants 
out and turn the cottages into a "boutique hotel".'

According to recent estimates, a two-bedroom flat in central London will now set buyers back by around £1.1million

But outside of the capital, property is far cheaper - with mansions available for much less

The more extravagant examples are extremely remote - but could provide luxury living for those who don't commute
