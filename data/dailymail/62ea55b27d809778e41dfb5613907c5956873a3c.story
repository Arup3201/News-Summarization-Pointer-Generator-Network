Eat less. Exercise more. Cut the carbs. Dieters all have their own theories on which strategy works but according to psychologists, joining a slimming group is the best way to lose weight.

Researchers found that the support received at such groups led to dieters losing three times as much as those attending  groups supervised by medical professionals.

The study also found that those attending slimming classes, such as Weight Watchers, lose double the amount of weight than those who followed a strict weight-loss programme set up by a doctor.

The findings suggest that inspiration from someone who has personally had weight-loss success is often more successful than medical programmes set up by GPs.

Group classes which encourage members to share experiences and reach a ‘goal weight’ proved particularly successful, it was said.

In the trial, 141 overweight and obese men and women were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of weight loss treatment by a health professional, or 48 weeks of Weight Watchers, or a combined treatment consisting of 12 weeks of the former then 36 weeks of the latter.

The investigators assumed that the combined treatment would produce better weight losses than Weight Watchers alone, but contrary to expectations, Weight Watchers participants had lost more weight at the end of treatment.

Those participating in the study who used WeightWatchers lost the most weight

In fact, more than one third of the Weight Watchers participants lost 10 per cent or more of their starting weight, compared to 15 per cent of those in the combined group and 11 per cent in the professionally-led group.

The trial, run by City University of New York, was the first to compare professionally-delivered group-based behavioural weight-loss treatment to Weight Watchers, which is led by trained peer counsellors who have achieved their own weight loss.

Weight Watchers was chosen because it is the largest commercial slimming programme in the US and is behaviourally-oriented, focusing on changing eating habits and doing more exercise to lose weight.

Angela Marinilli Pinto, assistant professor of psychology at Baruch College in the City University of New York, who led the trial, said: ‘This study is important because, with almost 70 per cent of American adults classified as overweight or obese, there is a need to provide practical treatment solutions that are effective, accessible, and affordable.

‘Results of this study demonstrate that the Weight Watchers program can produce clinically meaningful weight losses.’

A spokesman for Weight Watchers said: ‘Weight Watchers provides state-of-the-art weight-management services that are as good as the standard behaviour therapy delivered by healthcare professionals.

‘And Weight Watchers costs less, is fully scalable and is usually more convenient to participate in.’

The study, funded by the US National Institutes of Health, is published in the journal Obesity.

The clinical trials found that group-based treatment led by peer counselors is just as effective as that led by health 
professionals
