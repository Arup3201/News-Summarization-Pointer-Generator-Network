Women should embrace numerous sexual partners instead of channeling their energy into finding 'the one', a new book advises.

A sex coach trained in midwifey, Lauren Brim, 31, grew up in a Christian family in Orange County, California, which taught sex is sacred in marriage.

It is global a social construct, she says, built to wound women sexually.

Now, with eight partners on the go and quite a few under her belt, LA-based Brim insists she has been enlightened.

Enlightened: Lauren Brim says women are wounded sexually by looking for 'the one' instead of enjoying sex

'Sex is really energising. What’s tiring is dating,' she told The Telegraph.

'Women are so insistent on partnership and marriage because culture gives them no other format for sustained and socially approved sexuality and love.'

In her recently-released book, The New Rules Of Sex, Brim describes her colorful catalogue of sexual experiences - sex with exes, with women, with numerous people at once, in all manner of unusual locations.

And she reveals midwifery led her to a sexual awakening.

'I was watching women giving birth,' she explains in a YouTube promotion, 'and I was seeing that women who were in touch with their sexuality had much easier birth experiences - sometimes orgasmic birth experiences; empowering experiences.

'Women who weren't in touch with their sexuality really struggled. They had a lot of interventions a lot of problems.'

The realization provoked her to analyze the rules of sex in western society, she says.

'I was raised in a Christian family and was getting this message from my family, from society, from the church, that sexuality was really not ok; that it was something you could have with your husband when you got married.

'Later in my adult life I got more messages from society that it was ok to have sex but only with someone that you saw a potential relationship with; with someone that could potentially become your husband.

'That didnt feel great either.

'So I was suffering a lot with how to be sexual. I had this sexuality inside me and never felt like I could express it without getting in trouble for it.'

When she turned 27, finding a relationship became near-impossible. 

'I looked around and saw there were many single people around me, all of them attractive, talented and intelligent people,' she told The Telegraph.

'Some of them hadn’t been in a relationship for years.'

'I don’t believe in putting your energy into waiting for the perfect partner to come along. I believe in looking at what’s there.'

'Drop your expectations in men': Brim said she, like many , was confusing sex with potential relationships

Brim, a trained dancer who has performed with New York City's Radio City Rockettes, insists the book is not a How To guide - rather a reconfiguration of sexual rules.

She says readers will be empowered to stop expecting love from sex, which should be celebrated in its own right.

'These expectations I had of my sexual partners - "why didnt they love me?"

'Sex and relationships and love were knotted up and I needed to unravel them. 

'We need to set women free because women are really sexual and they're powerful.

Her message to the female population? 'Relate to people differently, have less expectations [for your relationships].'
