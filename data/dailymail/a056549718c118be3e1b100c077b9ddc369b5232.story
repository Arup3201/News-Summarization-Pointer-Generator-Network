Swansea City midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson insists he has no regrets about choosing to join Tottenham over Liverpool despite enduring a disappointing two seasons in north London.

The Iceland international made his name in the Premier League at Swansea under Brendan Rodgers and had the opportunity to follow him to Liverpool in 2012.

Sigurdsson chose Tottenham instead but returned to south Wales after a disappointing two-year spell at White Hart Lane. The 25-year-old has no regrets, though.

Sigurdsson said he enjoyed his time at Spurs and was pleased to play with people like Gareth Bale 

He said: 'I always say I enjoyed my time at Spurs and I improved as a player so I don't look back and think "what if?". 

'I played with some really good players and I'm in a good team now and really enjoying my football.

'With the Brendan link in the Press it seemed it was more likely I'd go there but Tottenham showed a lot of interest in me and at that time they had players like Gareth Bale and things looked really good. 

'Obviously there have been plenty of changes over the past two years and new faces have been brought in but I will always remember my time as a positive one.'

Sigurdsson left north London after a disappointing two years in which he failed to establish himself

Sigurdsson and Swansea will come face-to-face with Rodgers and Liverpool at the Liberty Stadium in their next league match, and the midfielder admitted he has a lot to thank the Northern Irishman for. 

'He was the one who pushed me into the first team,' said Sigurdsson. 'I played my first games under him at Reading and he brought me to Swansea as well so I will always be grateful to him for his confidence.

'He is a great manager. His one-on-one skills are really good and he protects the players as well. 

'He's gone through that phase when some people wanted him to leave Anfield, has come back strong and the team is playing really well.

'I will always remember what he did for me, he has played a big part in my career. I will always be thankful for that.'
