A deputy who jumped on to roof of a 19-year-old's car and shot her dead will not be charged.

Samantha Ramsey was killed by Boone County deputy Tyler Brockman as she left a party in April. 

Now, a Boone County grand jury has decided not to indict Brockman, who has always maintained he acted in self-defense, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports.

Ramsey was attempting to leave a field party along the Ohio River when Brockman tried to stop her car to determine whether she was impaired.

According to a statement made by Brockman to his supervisor, the deputy said the teenager did not stop and instead struck him with her Subaru which is when he was thrown onto the hood of her car.

As he tried to stay on the car, he says Ramsey speed up and, fearing for his life, he fired into the windshield four times.

An evidence report released by authorities Friday shows Ramsey had a blood alcohol content of .12 when Brockman killed her, reports WCPO.com.

It also states Brockman's right boot had tire marks and his foot was bruised from Ramsey's vehicle. 

After her death one of Ramsey's passengers contested the deputy's story, insisting Ramsey did not hit the deputy, but that the deputy had jumped onto the hood.

'Today, the Grand Jury of Boone County heard all of the evidence and voted not to charge Deputy Brockman with any criminal wrongdoing,' Brockman's statement issued by his attorneys continued. 

'The Grand Jury got it right.'

Off camera: The shooting was not shown in the footage - the smoke is coming from the car after it crashed into a ditch

Shell-shocked: The passenger on the left side of the screen stumbled out of the car and collapsed onto the ground in tears, the driver of the car on the right threw his arms in the air just after the shots were fired

Devastated: Another person collapses into the street on the right side of the screen and rocks back and forth uncontrollably

The joint statement from Crawford and Boone County Commonwealth's Attorney Linda Tally Smith said that the 'Boone County Sheriff's Department has conducted the investigation since its inception.'

In a statement sent to The Huffington Post, Ramsey's mom, Brandi Stewart, expressed her disappointment in the grand jury's decision.

'Now, over six months after my daughter was shot to death by Deputy Brockman, the only thing I know for sure is that he will not answer for his actions and that in Boone County, you cannot indict a Boone County Deputy for shooting an unarmed 19-year-old four times in front of numerous witnesses,' Stewart said.

She added the investigation should have been handled by another law enforcement agency.

'The Community's concerns regarding the Boone County Sheriff investigating one of it own deputies have been confirmed,' Stewart said. 'The investigation should have immediately been turned over to another police agency.'
