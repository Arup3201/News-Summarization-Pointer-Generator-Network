Better late than never: A script for The Simpsons written 25 years ago by Judd Apatow (pictured) is finally being made into an episode, which will air next week 

Next week's episode of The Simpsons is one of the show's oldest, but it's not a re-run. 

Judd Apatow wrote the script 25 years ago, when he was a struggling stand-up comic hoping to break out as a TV writer.

While the spec script was rejected at the time, Apatow went on to create his own TV show Freaks and Geeks and then achieve wide-spread success on the big screen with hit comedies like The 40-year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. 

The episode is finally being made a reality after a Simpsons producer heard an interview in which Apatow talked about writing the spec script, and how it influenced his later work. 

The script was written in 1990 when then 22-year-old Apatow was working as a stand-up comic, and writing spec scripts on the side with hopes of transitioning to a job in TV. 

The Simpsons was in its first season at the time, with only six episodes for Apatow to study in order to copy the comedic style. 

The episode, titled 'Bart's New Friend', follows Simpsons patriarch Homer being hypnotized into thinking he is 10 years old. He befriends his own son and then doesn't want to go back to being an adult. Basically the opposite of the 1988 Tom Hanks movie Big.

Simpsons' producer Al Jean finally green-lighted the script when he heard Apatow mention the long-lost episode in a public interview at the L.A. County Museum.

In the interview, Apatow goes on the explain how all of his work since then has basically been inspired by that episode, and it's theme of clinging to childhood.

The long-lost script: The episode follows Simpsons patriarch Homer (left), who is hypnotized into thinking he is 10 years old. He befriends his son Bart (right) and then doesn't want to go back to being an adult. Apatow wrote the script in 1990, when he was just 22 years old and struggling stand-up comic 

Hit maker: Apatow has since reached wide-spread fame by writing popular comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. He is also an executive producer and writer on the HBO TV show Girls

'I have always been fascinated with how difficult it is to grow up. In fact, everything I've done on film and TV is pretty much based on my Simpsons idea. I can't shake it,' Apatow told TV Guide. 

For example, one of Apatow's biggest hits, Knocked Up, is about a slacker forced to confront adulthood after getting a one-night-stand pregnant. He is also an executive producer and writer on HBO show Girls, about a group of twenty-something women struggling to get their lives together.

Luckily, Apatow saved the script, despite his wife's (actress Leslie Mann) insistence that he purge some of his old papers. 

However, he admits the script wasn't exactly film-ready. 

'It's a pretty rough script — when I reread it I wasn't exactly glowing with pride — but Al and the staff did their magic on it. 

Apatow says getting to hear his script come to life at the table read 'one of the greatest days of my life'.

Judd Apatow's episode airs January 11 on Fox at 8pm. The episodes comes a year after Apatow got to voice a character of himself on the iconic show.
