Recovery: John Eccles, 35, was left with a concave skull after being attacked by former best friend Andrew Dodds in Consett, County Durham

A man had to have one third of his skull removed after he was attacked by his former best friend turned love rival.

Medical staff were forced to insert a metal plate into John Eccles's head after he smashed his skull against a wall during the confrontation that left him in a coma for two weeks.

The 35-year-old said he felt like he had been 'hit by a car' when he finally woke in the hospital, where he was forced to stay for six months.

When he first became responsive following the incident with former friend Andrew Dodds, he was unable to remember what had happened.

The two men ended their friendship of more than 20 years when Dodds started a relationship with Mr Eccles's partner and the mother of his daughter.

Mr Eccles smacked his head against a wall after being punched by Dodds outside a nightclub in Consett, County 
Durham, last April, knocking him unconscious.

Dodds was jailed for three years last 
August for unlawful wounding at Durham Crown Court.

Mr Eccles, who works as a leisure centre duty manager, has made a remarkable recovery but has suffered from memory loss, a speech impediment, partial paralysis on his right side and receives therapy to help him restore his cognitive skills.

Describing waking up from the attack 
for the first time, Mr Eccles, from Blackhill, near Consett, said: 'I 
did not know what was going on. I cannot remember what happened. My 
family had to tell me.'

Mr Eccles said that he could have died following the attack but said he was eager to return to work.

Charity: Mr Eccles raised £1000 for the Royal Victoria Infirmary's intensive care unit with his brother Mark (pictured together)

He said: 'I am having a meeting with occupational health this week so I will see what they say, but I would like to go back to work as soon as possible.

'I have been told it could be 18 months, it could be five or six years, but I want to go back now.

Mr Eccles was treated for heavy bleeding on the brain and remained in intensive care in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary for months after the incident..

Now Mr Eccles and his brother Mark, 32, have raised almost £1,000 for the unit following a charity night at the Number One Club in Consett.
