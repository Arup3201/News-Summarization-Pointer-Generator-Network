A panhandler has devised a creative way to raise cash - by entertaining motorists at a Tampa intersection while they wait for the lights to change.

Jeff Stevens, who waits at the intersection of Dale Mabry Highway and Kennedy Boulevard, dances, twirls a cane and brandishes signs that he hopes tickle drivers into handing over change.

'Wife + pet tiger abducted. Need help w/ ransom to save my lovable tiger. They can have wife, so much quieter at home,' one sign reads.

Thinking outside the box: Jeff Stevens performs and holds up creative signs for Tampa motorists

He has become somewhat of a local fixture after putting on his shows every Sunday.

Stevens said he had originally held signs reading 'homeless' but realized he had to try something different when they failed to stir passersby into handing over donations.

'I started coming up with comedy things and trying to make people laugh,' he told Bay News 9. 'It just brightens their day.'

He managed to get a full time job working at Denny's and moved into an apartment in 2011, but he still needed to perform to make ends meet.

Having a laugh: He places signs along the roadside and hopes they tickle motorists into giving a donation

New approach: He said that he previously wrote 'homeless' on signs but that they never worked

He continues with his weekly performances in a bid to pay bills and start saving money.

Now he has dreams of returning to what he used to do - traveling with the circus and performing with wild cats, he told Bay News 9.

He told the channel he is related to Ron and Joy Holiday, who featured in HBO's documentary Cat Dancers and who hit headlines when their partner was killed by one of their tigers.

But after he left the circus, his parents passed away and he clashed with the law - eventually bringing him to Florida and his intersection.

Former career: He said he wants to work with a traveling circus - a job he previously had (pictured)

Performance: Every weekend, he twirls a cane as cars wait for the lights to change at the intersection

And until he achieves his dream of getting back to the circus, he said he's happy to stay here putting on his shows.

'It blesses my heart to see them laughing,' he said of passersby. 'If I don't make a dollar or anything, it feels good right here just to see somebody smile.'
