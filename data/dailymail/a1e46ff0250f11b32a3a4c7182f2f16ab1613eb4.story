Hearing the Newcastle fans laying into Alan Pardew, I have to laugh.

Not because it's funny. It's really hard when you're a manager and you keep reading speculation about your future and hearing things being sung on the terraces.

But it reminds me of what happened to me.

When I was manager at Leicester City, we played away at Nottingham Forest in a local derby with 25,000 fans on my back.

VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Pardew: The tension created by the fans isn't going to go away

Alan Pardew being on thin ice at Newcastle United reminds Mad Dog of his time as Leicester City boss

Newcastle fans are calling for Pardew to be sacked after the club's poor start to the season

We were losing 1-0 when the Forest fans sung as one: 'You're getting sacked in the morning' as I stood in the technical area.

The Leicester fans stood there quietly as the volume seemed to go up a level each time the chant, 'You're getting sacked in the morning' went around the stadium.

At first I stood there stony-faced. Then I realised they were probably right!

I took a deep breath and started to nod in agreement, with a big smile on my face, knowing I was a lame Dog on the way to the sacking graveyard.

It can be tough on the touchline. Whether you're at the top or bottom, it's a Mad place to be.

Martin Allen likens the vitriol aimed at Alan Pardew to his brief experience in charge of Leicester in 2007

BIG BONDZ COST ME FIFTY QUID

It was half-time in our away match at Forest Green Rovers and one of our players said: 'We need someone to attack these corners and free kicks.'

I pointed to our big strong centre back Bondz N'Gala, who had not scored all season, and told the team if he scores I'll join them at the corner flag to celebrate. My throwaway comment drifted around the room.

Bondz N'Gala, who moved from Portsmouth to Barnet in the summer, scored a last-ditch winner for his side against Forest Green and lost Mad Dog £50

We were one up, but after 88 minutes Forest Green equalised. Then deep into stoppage time, we won a corner.

As I sat in the technical area I was thinking this was a good point away from home. Bondz strode forward, looking across and cutting me an evil stare.

He got closer and closer to the 18 yard box and the spring in his step was that of a passionate gladiator going in to his final battle.

The corner came over and big Bondz leaped seven foot above the 6ft 7in centre back – I might be exaggerating slightly there – to power in an unstoppable Joe Royle-like, Mick Harford-like, Andy Carroll-like header into the back of the net.

All the players ran to the corner flag and beckoned me over. The subs were pushing and prodding me to go.

But the fourth official, god bless him, saved me a fine of a weeks' wages by pointing his finger and telling me not to do it.

The moment was there in front of me. I took a step back, a deep breath, and sat down.

When the players came in a minute later, with three points in the bag, our young full back Andy Yiadom looked up as I put a sugar in my coffee and said, 'Gaffer, you bottled it.'

It's cost me £50 for the players Christmas party fund, but it saved me a weeks' wages.

RYDER CUP TACTICS

Every time it comes around, I try to catch as much Ryder Cup action as I can.

I shot off from training early on the Friday, crashed on the sofa with a packet of digestive biscuits and barely missed a shot apart from a few hours on Saturday afternoon winning that match against Forest Green to leave us top of the table.

Good old Tom Watson reminded me of a Ronald Reagan-style American ambassador who is popular with everybody.

Phil Mickleson was out of order for having a go at him just after they had lost.

He spoke of Paul Azinger's management style as having 'pods' of players and seeking opinions of who they would like to play with and if players were not in form or physically needed to be rested. The senior players in the pods would have open communication with Azinger.

It was kind of like a pyramid effect.

Phil Mickelson (left) was out of order criticising the performance of Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson (right) but the pyramid-like 'pod' system is precisely what Mad Dog uses in his own management style 

Well, at Gillingham I worked on exactly the same management style. We had one team captain, four senior players helping me decide training with my two assistants Carl Muggleton and John Schofield helping me make the final decisions.

It is the same here now at Barnet where I have two player coaches and five senior players who all contribute to our training, to the work we do, to the game plan, to the physical needs of the players and, most importantly, to keep all our players united and fighting for the cause.

ALLEN'S ANALYSIS

The player I keep hearing about... Britt Assombalonga

It's always nice and reassuring when you see players you've highlighted and tried to sign in the past going on and doing very well.

Assombalonga, the Nottingham Forest striker who is top scorer in the Championship, was on loan at Southend from Watford when we tried to get him on a season-long loan while I was in charge at Gillingham.

Britt Assombalonga, the Championship's top scorer so far, will be a success in the Premier League

He has pace and excellent technical finishing skills and a hunger and appetite. He always plays on the shoulder of the last defender looking to get in behind them.

I'm delighted he's gone on and done well, and I'm not surprised at his success so far this season.

He's still only 21, and, for me, his progression into the Championship, after playing at Southend, is an all-important stepping stone to what will be a successful career in the Premier League.

He will be banging Premier League goals in soon – and maybe for Forest.

One thing I'd change about... FOREIGN IMPORTS

After watching England play in the World Cup this summer and having traipsed around South Africa and seen how disastrous those tournaments were, something needs to change.

A rule needs to be brought in that only quality overseas players can play in our leagues.

It's been flooded with average players at all levels and it's stopping good young English players getting the valuable experience they need.

A system should be put in place, so only players who have 10 caps for a national team in the top 10 FIFA rankings, or 20 caps for teams between 10 and 20, or 30 caps for those between 20 and 30, and so on, can join English clubs.

We need to sort out our national team.

Louis van Gaal's sutocratic style could mean tricky times ahead for Manchester United

The big issue...

Louis van Gaal going public that the Manchester United players have been unable to grasp his ideas and trying to blend so many magnificent, talented, egotistical forwards is going to be a true test of his management style.

His school teacher background, his straight, upright spine gives the impression of an autocratic leader who believes he is above all criticism.

We're all well aware of Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer, but on the other side he was a father figure who knew everything about every player from the top to the bottom of Manchester United.

Van Gaal completely lacks that understanding side. With their player recruitment and his dictatorial style I think tricky times lie ahead.

David Moyes will be sitting watching the results, shaking his head, thinking if he had all that money to spend, where would they be now?
