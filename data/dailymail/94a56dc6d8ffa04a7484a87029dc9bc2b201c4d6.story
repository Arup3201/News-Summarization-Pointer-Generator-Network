Tony Blair said yesterday that Eurosceptics were a ‘virus’ blighting politics and that Britain would be a second-rate power if it left the EU.

The former prime minister warned that David Cameron’s policy of trying to repatriate powers would simply pave the way for withdrawal, which was being hastened by some Conservatives.

‘The Right have got it really bad on this Europe thing,’ he told business leaders at Chatham House in London. ‘It is a kind of virus that makes you want to take positions for the sake of asserting them, when a rational analysis says you don’t need to be in that position.’

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that it would be 'a monumental error of statesmanship' for Britain to turn its back on Europe

He said there was a ‘chasm of error’ between understanding that Europe was in crisis, and saying that the logical response was for Britain to leave.

While Britain could operate in the global economy outside the EU, he said withdrawal would be a ‘monumental error of statesmanship’, diminishing trade relations with China and India, and influence on decisions about defence, energy and foreign policy.

Mr Cameron has indicated that he wants to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU, but is resisting pressure for an in-or-out referendum.

Mr Blair added: ‘This is the last moment, the last moment conceivable, that we should start talking about leaving, about quitting the field just as the game starts, marginalising ourselves at the very point at which we should be at the centre of things.

‘Europe is a destiny we will never embrace easily. But it is an absolutely essential part of our nation remaining a world power, politically and economically.  

He added: 'All my life I've fought ideology on the left. The right have got it really bad on this Europe thing. It's a virus.'

But his intervention in the Europe debate attracted a scathing response from Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party.

David Cameron last week told journalists a deal on the EU budget had not been reached at a summit in Brussels

'To hear a man who uses snake oil rather than milk on his cornflakes and was responsible for an illegal war talk about statesmanship is remarkable,' Mr Farag said.

'To hear it when it is a merely poor disguise for a job application for the post of EU President must make any decent citizen feel their skin itch.'

Mr Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs to adopt a more Eurosceptic stance, having suffered an embarrassing rebellion when dozens of backbenchers demanded a cut in the EU budget.

There is growing speculation that Ed 
Miliband may be considering committing Labour to an in/out poll, Mr 
Blair said it was not ‘sensible’ to be talking about a referendum at 
this point.

The Prime 
Minister has ruled out an in-out referendum, but has proposed a 
renegotiation to bring back powers from Brussels which would then be put
to the British people in a vote.

But
Mr Blair said Mr Cameron should ignore the calls from the Tories struck
down by the ideological ‘virus’ of euroscepticism. ‘The right have got 
it really bad on this Europe thing,’ he said.

He said talk of renegotiating EU membership ‘is the refuge of those who want to leave but want to persuade people that really it’s just an adjustment of our relationship’.

He went on: ‘Here it is no longer good enough for us pro-Europeans to claim that the case for departure is made only by atavistic Little Englanders, or to pretend that outside the EU, Britain would collapse or disintegrate.

‘Britain could have a future outside of Europe. The question is whether it should. We should ask, not: could it be done; but is it wise? Is it a sensible judgement in our long-term interests?’

He said leaving the EU would be ‘politically debilitating, economically damaging and hugely destructive of Britain's true long term interests’.

In a globalised world that will increasingly be dominated by emerging giants like China and India, Britain needs the "heft" of the EU to exert an influence internationally and support its own interests on issues like trade, climate change and defence, he said.

And he said the UK can best use its influence to shape the EU by making clear it wishes to remain at its heart.
