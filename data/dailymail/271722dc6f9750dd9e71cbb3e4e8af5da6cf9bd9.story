An obsessive woman who made her ex-boyfriend's life a living hell after they broke up is facing a lengthy prison sentence for her campaign of terror against him.

Tawny Blazejowksi, 41, of St. Augustine, Florida launched a campaign of hate against her former lover Joe Good, 51, turning his life upside down because they had split up. 

The petite blonde got him arrested three times and fired from his job at an insurance company, where he had worked for over 24 years.

The pair had dated for three years and shared six children together from previous marriages.

But when their relationship ended, she spun a web of lies, falsely accusing him of domestic abuse and then targeting his close friends, colleagues and neighbors.

Police finally caught up with her when she was sentenced to nine years in prison last Friday.

She faces a string of charges including three counts of threats for extortion, four counts of aggravated stalking and one count of false report of abuse, child neglect or abandonment of 16 people from Florida to Chicago to California according to 20/20 on ABC News.

According to Good, Blazejowksi became irate after she was forced to cancel a holiday that the couple had planned together.

Then less than an hour later, Good said he received a text message notifying him that his email password had been changed.

He claims that Blazejowski had hacked his personal email account and sent pornographic photos of Good to his employer.

This led to his arrest on October 19, 2012, but his vengeful ex-girlfriend had much more in store for him.

She went to the sheriff’s office with a bloody face and accused Good of domestic violence.

He told 20/20: ‘I ended up going to jail that night, because here’s the thing: The girl says a guy hit her. Most people think, ‘Wow, the guy hit her.’ They don’t think the girl’s lying.’

Next, Blazejowski called the Florida Abuse Hotline, accusing Good and his teenage son of operating a child pornography ring.  

‘It was total harassment,’ he said. ‘I did everything I could to stay away from her. She was one step ahead of me the whole time.’

Blazejowski then turned on his friends and colleagues.

Jenny Robor, Good’s former colleague at the insurance company, told ‘20/20: ‘She did a Crimestoppers tip to me, accusing me of allegations against my kids.'

'The things that are on there I can’t even repeat. They’re so horrible.’

Blazejowski anonymously told Crimestoppers that Robor would deliver her young children to Good’s sex ring, none of which was true.  

Yet, during his ordeal, Good said that he struggled to get investigators and lawyers to believe him, until a lawyer Bryan Shorstein stepped in to help him. 

Shorstein said he first made sure that Good was actually innocent, then went to the sheriff’s office to convince detectives of the same thing.

Over seven months, St. Johns County Sheriff's Office Detectives George Harrigan and Shannon Andrews carried out an investigation into the claims. 

Andrews told ‘20/20: ‘It was hard to keep up with it, she was stalking faster than we could investigate.’

Soon, Good’s new girlfriend, Mariela Murphy, reported an anonymous letter threatening her then-17-year-old daughter.

‘It said, ‘This is what Erin will look like the next time Mariela sees her if she sees or even talks to Joe Good one more time,’ and attached was a picture of … a girl’s mutilated body,’ she said.

Detective Harrigan said: ‘She [Blazejowski] was the stalker at one point, but when this happened, she became the stalked.'

They later found that anonymous reports which had been sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Cybercrimes came from  Blazejowski’s computer.

They used a search warrant to search her home and discovered more than seven full notebooks detailing the dates and times of everything she had done.

She was later arrested and charged with making threats to maim and murder.

She pleaded no contest to the eight felony counts against her, but her lawyers argued that she has obsessive compulsive disorder and is bipolar, which contributed to her crimes. 

Judge Michael Traynor, from St. Johns County Criminal Court acknowledged her disorders, but said her clearly thought-out acts could not be ignored. 

He sentenced her to  nine years in prison, two years of house arrest and 19 years probation.

She is now in jail.

Blazejowski said at her sentencing: ‘Not only did I hurt my own children, I hurt other children.'

‘I am pleading with you, your honor, to please grant me forgiveness. I ask my victims for forgiveness, and for mercy, and for you to please not take me away from my children who need me.’ 

However, her victim, Good, still has a criminal record because of her actions.

He said: ‘[I] just put one foot in front of the other and keep moving, it’s all you can do.’
