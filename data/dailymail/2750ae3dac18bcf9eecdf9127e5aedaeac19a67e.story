The 29-year-old, an artist from Manchester, recently spent £2,500 on a green stage outfit worn by Ginger Spice Geri Halliwell during the 1998 SpiceWorld tour.

Aged 11, around the time the 1990s pop group brought out the song Wannabe, Miss West discovered her love for the band just like millions of other girls her age.

She said: 'The collection started when people would buy me Spice Girl-related Christmas presents when I was younger.

'Then when the Spice Girls started bringing out merchandise and memorabilia, I would start buying that with my pocket money.

'In my bedroom I had this shelf, and I would arrange my Spice Girl objects on it. I would enjoy arranging everything at the weekend and that was like my form of 'play'.

'Also, if I knew an item was about to end on eBay, I would make sure I went to the Internet cafe to bid on it, or I would rope in friends to do it for me if I wasn't able to.

We currently host many quirky collections at the attraction and SpiceWorld is a fantastic addition to the 700 exhibits we have on display.

'There is no doubt the Spice Girls had unbelievable chart success.'
