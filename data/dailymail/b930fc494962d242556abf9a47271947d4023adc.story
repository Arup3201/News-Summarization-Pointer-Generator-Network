The notorious underarm delivery that created one of the most controversial moments in world cricket history is still hard to revisit after more than three decades.

But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt.

The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match.

But Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie any chance of hitting a six.

As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust.

Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash.

Despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time, it was deemed 'an act of cowardice' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost New Zealand the tournament.

But Black Caps fast bowler Tim Southee, who was two-years-old at the time of the underarm incident, said the infamous bowl is rarely mentioned.

'I guess a few of us were too young to remember seeing it but we know it happened,' Southee said at a conference on Friday.

'I haven’t heard too much about the underarm.'

While New Zealand prepares ahead of their first ever World Cup final on Sunday, Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has announced his retirement from one-day cricket on the eve of the match.

The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years.
