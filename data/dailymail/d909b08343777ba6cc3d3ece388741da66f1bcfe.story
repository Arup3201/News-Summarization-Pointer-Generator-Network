Michael Sam, Missouri's All-American defensive lineman has announced he is gay - putting him in the position of becoming the first publicly gay pro-football player in the NFL.

Sam, 23, a 6-foot-2, 260-pound senior, is predicted to be drafted into the NFL and came out in  series of coordinated interviews with The New York Times and ESPN's Outside the Lines program on Sunday.

'I'm Michael Sam. I'm a football player and I'm gay,' Sam, a defensive lineman, said in the video posted online. 'I just want to own my truth before anyone breaks a story about me.'

Proud: Michael Sam came out to his team mates earlier this year and here he is celebrating with fans after the game against the Kentucky Wildcats at Commonwealth Stadium on November 9, 2013 in Lexington, Kentucky. Missouri won 48-17

He went on to say that when he first spoke with his teammates about his sexuality last August, they rallied around him and supported him.

'We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage,' the NFL said in a statement.

'Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.'

The Missouri senior led the Southeastern Conference last season with 10-and-a-half sacks and 18 tackles and the Associated Press named him SEC defensive player of the year.

Representatives for Sam had been letting NFL teams aware that he was planning to come out before this month's NFL scouting combine.

And on Saturday evening, it was revealed that Sam dined with group of supporters, including former NFL punter Chris Kluwe and linebackers Brendon Ayanbadejo - who are both outspoken supporters of gay rights.

Respect: In interviews with ESPN, The New York Times and Outsports that were published Sunday, Michael Sam said his teammates and coaches at Missouri have known since August.

No NFL player has ever announced publicly he's gay while his career is active. Former players including Esera Tuaolo have admitted they are gay after retiring.

In his series of interviews, Sam said, 'I am an openly, proud gay man.'

'It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.'

Other athletes to come out as gay have included Jason Collins, a veteran of 12 NBA seasons who revealed he was homosexual last year and Robbie Rogers, who plays Major League Soccer with the LA Galaxy.

Division III Willamette kicker Conner Mertens, a redshirt freshman, said last month he was bisexual.Sam said many people at the college all-star game for NFL prospects seemed to know that he was gay.

Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player.

'Coaches just wanted to know a little about ourselves, our majors, where we're from, and something that no one knows about you,' Sam said.

'And I used that opportunity just to tell them that I was gay. And their reaction was like, `Michael Sam finally told us.'"

Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement Sunday night he was proud of Sam and how he represented the program.

'Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other,' Pinkel said.

'If Michael doesn't have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don't think there's any way he has the type of season he put together.'

Missouri linebacker Donovan Bonner has been a teammate of Sam's for five years.

'We knew of his status for 5 years and not one team member, coach, or staff member said anything says a lot about our family atmosphere,' Bonner tweeted.

GLAAD, a national lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender advocacy group responded to the news Sunday night.

'By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,' GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statment.

'With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts — in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.'

Speaking to ESPN, Sam said that, 'I came to tell the world' about his sexual orientation.

He said that though he was nervous about doing it, it also felt good.

'It's a load off my chest,' he said.

'I told my teammates this past August that I came out to my teammates, and they took it great. They rallied around me, they supported me, and I couldn't have asked for better teammates.'
