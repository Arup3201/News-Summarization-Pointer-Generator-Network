The attention of  people around the world was centred on Lewis Hamilton winning the Spanish Grand Prix, but Formula One's intrigue involved a British boffin with an H4 pencil.

As so often, the real stories occur off the track. So it is in the case of Adrian Newey, Red Bull's peerless designer, whose services are being sought by Ferrari.

Newey is thought to earn £7million a year at Red Bull, meaning that to sign him Ferrari's president Luca di Montezemolo would need to be the man that broke the bank at Maranello. That is something he would be willing to do.

In demand: Ferrari are courting Red Bull's technical chief Adrian Newey in a bid to revive their fortunes

The Italian team are in an awful mess - one of their cars was lapped in Barcelona on Sunday - and the flamboyant Di Montezemolo is personally involved in sorting out the mess.

He has already parted company with Stefano Domenicali as team principal and replaced him with Marco Mattiacci, an executive from America who has extremely limited sporting experience.

There will be further changes throughout the team - 'we need defenders and midfielders, not just strikers,' as one respected Ferrari executive confessed - but the significance of signing Newey can hardly be overstated. He is, after all, the man behind 10 drivers' and 10 constructors' titles with  Williams, McLaren and Red Bull.

Out of sorts: Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was lapped during Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix

But would Newey go? He was equivocal about the possibility when asked by Sky. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I need to think about it. We're in the middle of the season and I'm just getting on with it.'

Asked again, he replied: 'At some point I am going to have to think about the future, but at the moment my focus is getting in front of the silver car (the Mercedes).'

Christian Horner, his boss at Red Bull, was firmer but not conclusive when he responded by saying: 'It is an annual thing that there is speculation about Adrian's future but he has made his feelings clear to me about the team.

'He has paternal feelings towards the team and he is much more involved than he has been. The speculation is purely that. You can understand why Ferrari would be looking. Adrian has always enjoyed a challenge.'

Newey, who still designs by hand on a sketch board, enjoys his life at Red Bull: the atmosphere is relaxed (but highly competitive), with a college-like air in his design department. It was that freedom, plus plenty of money, that convinced him to leave McLaren and its straitjacket approach to join the Milton Keynes factory and build four world championship-winning cars. Those working practices were sold to him by Horner over dinner at the Bluebird restaurant on Chelsea's King's Road.

Red Bull are struggling this year but that is down to their under-powered Renault engines rather than Newey's chassis. There is no sign of any strain in relations between Newey and his team.

It is more a matter of whether he is tempted to take on a new, perhaps final, challenge in  Formula One at the age of 55. Ferrari is alluring to anyone with racing in their soul.
