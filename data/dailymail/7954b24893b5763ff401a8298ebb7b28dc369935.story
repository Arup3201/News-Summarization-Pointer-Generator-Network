A boy suffering from more than 110 seizures a day is trying raise £65,000 to fund treatment that could eliminate his convulsions for good.

Max McGhie, 13, from East Kilbride, Scotland, has a rare form of drug-resistant epilepsy which is so severe he has almost lost the ability to speak.

Max and his family now hope that treatment in the U.S. could offer a way out, and perhaps eliminate his seizures for good.

Max has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, an uncommon strain of the condition leaving him in such severe convulsions medication does not help.

As a result of the severity of his spasms and the cocktail of drugs he has to take, Max's speech has almost disappeared.

Max and his family, mother Seonaid, father Douglas and his ten-year-old sister Charli are trying to raise £65,000 to send him to Miami, Florida for treatment.

Mrs McGhie says the family have no other options, having exhausted all alternatives available to them in the UK.

During the first week at the US centre, Max will have a variety of assessments which will help determine what treatment he receives in the second week of his fortnight-long visit.

Max was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut when he was four, and has been confined to a wheelchair, dependent on drugs, since

Mrs McGhie said: ‘We have tried everything we can in Britain to give Max a better quality of life.

He's on five different drugs at the moment, and we're still in pretty poor control.

 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome occurs in one 
in every 100 children with epilepsy and it is believed the condition may
 account for a mere three per cent of all childhood epilepsies.

The
 condition starts in childhood, typically between the ages of three and 
five, and males are five times more likely to be affected than females.

The
 most common type of seizure that affects those with the condition is 
atonic seizures, where the casualty falls to the ground.

However, sufferers can also experience absence seizures, where the person with epilepsy can appear vacant for several minutes.

People
 with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome have an higher mortality rate than their peers, which is believed to be due to poorly 
controlled seizures and injuries from falls.

‘Max
 received a vagus nerve implant, which is a small box under his arm that
 is supposed to help us to monitor and control his seizures.

‘But as soon as we turned it on, Max passed out for half an hour. It was scary, we thought we'd lost him.’

Despite having to be under constant supervision, Max loves playing the drums.

Despite having to spend 90 per cent of his time confined in a wheelchair, he loves playing football with his friends, who are all helping to raise funds for his treatment.

So far the Send Max to Miami Campaign has held a boxing night and a swim across Loch Fine in an attempt to raise the funds.

Mrs McGhie said: ‘I genuinely don't think we would have got any money if it wasn't for their support.

‘I'm so thankful for the support we have had so far, it's very touching and heart-warming.

‘If I think about it too much, it just makes me want to cry.’

Max's epilepsy is so severe he has almost lost the ability to speak, but his mother hopes the treatment in the U.S. might eliminate his seizures for good

Monique McAdams, chief executive of the East Kilbride Community Trust, is also walking the West Highland Way to help raise money for the treatment.

Monique has known Max for many years and is hopeful more people will get involved and support him.

Monique said: ‘Anything anyone can do to help is welcomed, whether it's donations or fundraising.

‘Our charity is only five years old, so we are still young, but we want to help raise awareness of Max's condition, then, hopefully, it will help raise money for Max.

‘I really want people to know it doesn't have to be a big, grand gesture to help, even just a small amount could really make the difference.’
