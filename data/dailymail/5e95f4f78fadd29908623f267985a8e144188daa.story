Stamp duty is a ‘middle class postcode tax’ which forces children to squat in their parents’ homes like ‘overgrown cuckoos’, Tory MPs said.

They demanded that George Osborne scrap the duty on homes worth less than £500,000, saying it ‘clobbers’ ordinary families and young first-time buyers.

Anne Main, Conservative MP for St Albans, said stamp duty ‘discriminates’ against the South and is a ‘burdensome tax affecting that most British of ideals – home ownership’.

Soaring house prices are pushing more and more people into paying higher rates of stamp duty

She claimed ministers’ failure to act has led her to question whether the current Tory leadership still shares Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a property-owning democracy.

Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, described stamp duty as a ‘vindictive stealth tax on aspirational Britain’ and an ‘assault by the taxman on hard-working, middle-income savers’.

But Treasury minister David Gauke rejected calls for reform, saying the duty raises almost £10billion a year and ‘we need the money’.

Stamp duty is paid when people buy a home, and is charged at differing rates depending on the value of the property.

It amounts to 1 per cent on homes worth between £125,001 and £250,000 and 3 per cent on properties up to £500,000.

Homes worth £500,001 or more are taxed at 4 per cent, while 5 per cent is charged on those worth more than £1million and 7 per cent on £2million-plus properties.

Treasury minister David Gauke said raising the stamp duty threshold to £500,000 would cost more than £4billion

Critics say the system is unfair because the thresholds between the bands have not changed for years, despite soaring house prices, meaning bands designed for the very well-off have now dragged in people on modest incomes.

Opponents also say the system distorts the housing market, and deem it unfair that buyers pay tax on the full value of the property, not just on the amount above the threshold.

Opening a Westminster Hall debate on stamp duty, Mrs Main said scrapping the levy on all homes worth less than £500,000 would fuel economic growth and increase home ownership. 

She claimed that any fall in Treasury receipts would be affordable, as long as the Government stops wasting money on projects such as the Lib Dems’ free school meals policy.

‘I’m concerned that by allowing so many people to be sucked into paying ever higher rates of tax, despite earnings either rising modestly – or indeed earnings that have been frozen, such as in the public sector – we are actually denying our families of the future the chance to own their own home,’ she said.

‘In 1980, we believed in encouraging families of all levels of income to own their own home and I hope we haven’t moved away from that ideal.’

She said that in her constituency, 87 per cent of homes are now subject to stamp duty. ‘Taxes that I believe were originally designed for the wealthy home buyer now bring in so much money to the Treasury that I think it’s being seen as an untouchable cash cow,’ she added. ‘Collection of stamp duty in its current forms is discriminatory, unfairly targeting certain areas of the country regardless of ability to pay and that cannot be fair.

‘It’s the ordinary families being clobbered the most by this tax.’ She gave the example of low-paid public sector workers, noting that ‘they have a mountain to climb’ in saving for their own property.

Mrs Main said they faced either paying high rents – particularly in the South – or alternatively may be ‘squatting like overgrown cuckoos in their parents’ home’.

‘In some postcodes, hardly anyone pays any tax to the Chancellor, not even 1 per cent on a modest three-bedroom semi-detached house,’ she said. ‘In other areas, such as mine, the same house has a huge 3 per cent tax bill attached to it.’

Mr Raab said that in 2000, there were 391,000 homes exempt from stamp duty, but the number has halved due to house price inflation.

‘It is not just the uber-wealthy ... who are paying the burden, it is middle England, the middle classes,’ he said.

Home ownership now stands at its lowest level since 1988. Only around 64 per cent of people own their own homes, down from 69 per cent in 2001.

Treasury minister David Gauke said raising the stamp duty threshold to £500,000 could result in tax revenues falling by £4.2billion.

‘In 2013/14, [stamp duty] raised £9.3billion. That is a substantial sum ... and it is money that, frankly, we need,’ he said.
