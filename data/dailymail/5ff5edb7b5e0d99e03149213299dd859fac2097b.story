Authorities in southwest Ohio say they have arrested a man with a loaded handgun painted red to resemble a toy.

Officers with Hamilton County's Sheriff's Office responding to a call about a man with a gun say they found 23-year-old Orlando Lowery with a red-painted .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and 9 grams of crack cocaine.

The arrest took place just before 1.30am in the 9500 block of Wayne Avenue in Cincinnati.

Suspect: Orlando Lowery, 23, was arrested in Cincinnati, Ohio, and booked on felony charges of carrying concealed weapons and drug possession 

Lowery was charged with third-degree carrying concealed weapons and fourth-degree possession of drugs, both felonies.

Sheriff Jim Neil issued a statement saying Lowery is a ‘dangerous individual’ who intentionally painted a loaded handgun red to dupe police.

The arrest Friday came just four days after legislation was introduced in Ohio to require that lookalike guns be brightly colored or otherwise marked. 

Not fit for kids: Sheriff's officials say Lowery was carrying a loaded .380-caliber handgun painted red

That bill came in the aftermath of two police fatal shootings in less than four months of young people who were holding lookalike guns, among them 12-year-old Tamir Rice. 

Sheriff Neil said it's 'a scary thought' that guns would be painted to mislead police.
