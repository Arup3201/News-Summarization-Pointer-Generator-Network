Korean pop-star Bobby Kim may soon become famous America - but not for his music.

The singer made headlines in South Korea on Wednesday, after he was escorted off a flight in San Francisco for causing a ruckus on board. 

The 41-year-old star's agents say he started drinking after he learned he would have to fly economy, and that he blacked out.

Commotion: Korean pop-star Bobby Kim allegedly got drunk and had to be escorted off a Korea Air flight to San Francisco and is now under investigation for sexually harassing a flight attendant 

According to witnesses,  Kim got drunk about five hours into the flight from Incheon, and began shouting and  sexually harassing a flight attendant by touching her waist. 

Those on board the flight reported that the scene lasted for about an hour, and that FBI agents and airport security escorted him off the plane when it touched down in San Francisco just after 10am, the Korean Times reports. 

Officials in the U.S. are now allegedly investigating Kim for sexual harassment. Since the incident happened mid-flight, both the country of arrival and the country where the airline is based have jurisdiction to investigate. 

Korean Air has reportedly filed a complaint against Kim, and South Korean officials will look into the matter when the pop-star returns to his home country.

For the time being, Kim is to remain in San Francisco for questioning. Two flight attendants and two passengers sitting next to Kim were called to give their account of events. 

Kim's label Oscar Entertainment issued a statement in response to the incident, published in The Korea Herald, which doesn't deny his behavior.  

'Kim drank some wine on the flight after he got distressed by Korean Air,' the agency said, adding that Kim was upset that the air line wouldn't upgrade his economy seat to business class.

'He does not exactly remember what mistakes he made.'
