As he explored his own back garden, a scrap of pottery protruding from the dirt caught Dr Owen Johnson's eye.

When the hospital worker tried to dig it out, it cracked open - spilling out a stream of gold and silver coins 'like a slot machine'.

Dr Johnson, 53, was inspecting a hole dug by builders at his home, in the village of High Ackworth, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire.

Token of love: The gold ring found among the hoard bears the romantic inscription 'When you see this, remember me'

The haul of Civil War currency could be worth as much as £51,000 - but the doctor has had to hand it all in to the Government.

Just under 600 coins dating from around the 1640s were found, as well as a stunning gold ring bearing the romantic inscription 'When this you see, remember me'.

Studies showed the find, with individual coins to the value of just over £85, was located near what looked like an old post, and could have been stashed underground by a Royalist who feared it would be looted by Roundhead troops.

Speaking outside Wakefield Coroner’s 
Court, where an treasure trove inquest ruled the find belongs to the 
state, Dr Johnson said he had taken the day off from Pinderfields 
Hospital when he made the amazing discovery last July.

Dr Johnson, who lives with wife Barbara, 55, and daughters Pippa, 22, Tembe, 21, and Lucy, 17, said: 'At first I thought the coins were some sort of toy, then we started having a closer look at them. The gold ones looked like they had just come out of a museum, and the ring is beautiful.

'It was then we started to realise this was something significant. It was very exciting and we just stood there for a long time looking at it.'

Council bosses in Wakefield are now hoping they can secure the historic hoard for display at Pontefract Museum.

Dr Johnson said: 'Pontefract Museum is very interesting but it could do with some highlights and this would definitely be a highlight, which would be good because Pontefract’s history is sometimes undervalued.'

Lisa Dodd, Wakefield Council’s service director for sport and culture, added: 'We believe these items have been in our district since the 1600s, making them a real part of this district’s rich history.

'It would be a great shame to not do all we can to try and keep the treasure in its rightful home for future generations to enjoy.

'The Wakefield district has a superb, nationally renowned heritage and Pontefract Museum would be a fitting home for the treasure.

'It would be yet another major attraction for visitors and contribute directly to the rich history of the area. It would also support the new Pontefract Castle development.'

The council will now wait for a valuation, after which it will be decided whether Dr Johnson will get any compensation. The hoard is more than 300 years old and so is covered by the Treasure Act of 1996.

Overthrown: King Charles I

When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent. His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule.

This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict.

The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow.

When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out.

The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east. They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists.

The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners. The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots.

In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin.

The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime. He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.
