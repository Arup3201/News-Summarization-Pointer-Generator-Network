Forget beef burgers, chicken burgers or even antelope burgers because Japanese food chain YO! Sushi is launching what may be the most bizarre fusion of East-meets-West cuisine yet.

From next week, you can buy a range of burgers - including chicken, salmon, prawn, tilapia or tofu - with the 'bun' being made of toasted Japanese rice, formed into a bap shape.

The £8 snack is served with gingery pickled 'daikon slaw' (a type of radish) in place of coleslaw, seaweed crackers for chips and 'misotchup' (ketchup made with miso). 

Very rice: YO! Sushi are launching an £8 sushi burger. You can choose 
from chicken, salmon, prawn, tilapia or tofu - with the 'bun' made of rice

Speaking about its latest wacky innovation, the chain, which is famous for its hufe sushi menu, says: 'You won't find beef in our YO! Burger or a stodgy bap covered in grease.'

On offer is the Chicken Yo! Burger, a chicken thigh seasoned with teriyaki sauce and served on a bed of lettuce with red onion, mayonnaise and topped with diced pineapple and white sesame seeds.

Fish lovers may prefer the Prawn Yo! Burger, a prawn cutlet served on white cabbage spiced with a dollop of curry mayonnaise and a sprinkle of spring onion and diced beni shoga or the Salmon Yo! Burger, kimchi salmon on a bed of lettuce, kimchi pickled vegetables and topped with mayonnaise and shredded nori.

Those looking for something even more unusual may opt for the Tilapia burger, which consists of two pieces of tilapia katsu fish resting on a bed of lettuce and served with a classic cheese slice topped with wakame tarter sauce.

For vegetarians, there's the Tofu Burger, which comes on a bed of lettuce and coriander pesto and is topped with a slice of avocado and fresh cress.

And the best news is that, while a Big Mac meals can add up to nearly 1,000 calories, these sushi burgers have a calorie content as low as 312 calories.

A spokesman for YO! Sushi said: 'YO! Sushi has always offered customers a unique dining experience and we are thrilled to be able to offer our customers something entirely new, inspired by Japan and exclusive to our restaurants.

'Unlike other run-of-the-mill burgers, you won't find anything like the YO! Burger anywhere else in the UK.'

 Sushi was founded in 1997, and was the first to bring the concept of a 
Japanese 'kaiten' sushi bar that delivered food via a conveyor belt to 
the UK.

The sushi burger is also served in specialised restaurants in Australia and the U.S.
