He is reported to have 'separated' from his wife of four years, Khloe Kardashian amid a storm of cheating and drug abuse allegations.

But for Lamar Odom, the claims that he is abusing hard drugs are especially shocking, given his own family history.

During a 2011 episode of his spin-off series Khloe & Lamar, the basketball star revealed that his father Joe Odom is a 'heroin addict,' and was largely absent after his mother passed away from colon cancer when he was just 12-years-old.

'I 
witnessed things that a 10-year-old definitely wasn’t supposed to see,' he told his reality star wife on the show after his father arrived unannounced at a Kardashian book signing event.

The
33-year-old star was largely brought up by his grandmother and later Jerry 
DeGregorio, the coach of his Rhode Island college team, according to People.

But the knowledge of his father's drug addictions appeared to play on his mind in the early stages of his basketball career when he was suspended for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy for the second time in eight months.

'A lot of times I'd think about it and 
say, "Damn, am I fighting my father's demons with this?" he told The Miami Herald in a 2003 interview, two years after admitting to using marijuana while in Los Angeles playing for The Clippers

Separated? Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom have reportedly 'split' after she allegedly threw him out of the house last Wednesday

'I just couldn't control myself in LA. I look back at it, the 
lifestyle that I was living and the things I had access to, it could 
have been something else.

'I was so weak and vulnerable in my life,' he added. 'I was just like, "I need to go somewhere and release. I need to feel different." There were times where I said, "Yo, I gotta go away for two days." I would go to practice, then nobody could find me.'

In the interview, Lamar claimed he had not smoked marijuana since his second suspension and put his drug use behind him. He declared he would 'probably start crying' if he did the drug again.

However, recent reports allege that Lamar is now in far deeper trouble, with his 'drug problem' reportedly the real reason behind his 'split' with wife Khloe, according to TMZ.

(Representatives from both Lamar and Khloe have yet to comment on the drug use allegations and reports of a split.)

Khloe has reportedly been attempting to 'save' her husband of four years from his alleged abuse of drugs after recently driving to see him at an undisclosed location.

The website alleges 
that Khloe and her family attempted to stage an intervention last week which resulted in Lamar leaving the marital home. He was pictured on Wednesday as an associate loaded a number of large 
suitcases into his car in Calabasas, California.

Sources familiar with the situation told TMZ that 'Khloe has not given up on Lamar' but 'will never get back with him until he's clean.

The 29-year-old TV personality is
also said to have taken 'no steps to file for divorce because she 
believes there's still a chance for Lamar to be saved,' the report adds.

'They
really do love each other,' a source told People. 'But she really feels
that this problem is out of control, and she's hurt that he won't get 
help.'

Sad: Lamar's mother, right, died of colon cancer when he was 12-years-old and his father, right was not around when he was a child

No other members of the Kardashian 
family have commented on the alleged issues between the couple, with 
Kris Jenner looking in good spirits as she visited a friend in Beverly 
Hills on Sunday.

But Khloe appears to be feeling the pressure, taking to her Twitter page in an expletive filled rant following more reports about her NBA star husband.

She wrote on Sunday: 'Really hard to sit here and listen to 
people talk s*** about my family! F*** you and shame on you! I'm too 
protective for this s***!'

Reports included the allegation that people close to the NBA star had been unable to find or 
contact him for 72 hours over the weekend although a representative for Lamar denied this.

A spokesperson for the basketball star told TMZ on Sunday afternoon that he was fine but would not reveal his whereabouts.

'Lamar is not missing. His wife knows exactly where he is,' his agent Jeff Schwartz told ESPN.

Back in August last year, Khloe is said to have
urged Lamar to go to rehab and after he entered a San 
Diego facility she hired private investigators to make sure he didn't 
leave.

Lamar reportedly 
constantly threatened to leave the rehab clinic and Khloe visited 
several times to convince him to stay, but he left after three weeks, 
sources said.

Lamar, who won two championships with 
the Los Angeles Lakers, stayed clean and played well last season for the
Los Angeles Clippers, but sources said he resumed using drugs after the
season.

The
couple have also been subject to persistent rumours that their marriage is 
in trouble after Lamar, allegedly cheated on Khloe with two 
different women.

TMZ reported Khloe is 'convinced it happened' as regards reports of Lamar's infidelity, but feels his drug 
abuse has been the main problem in their relationship.

'Khloe is more concerned about saving Lamar than ending her marriage,' a source told TMZ.

The couple got married in 2009 about a month after meeting each other.

Representatives for Lamar did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment.
