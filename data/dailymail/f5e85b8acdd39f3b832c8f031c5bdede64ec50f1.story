A New York man who became obsessed with convicted killer Jodi Arias has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill broadcaster Nancy Grace because of her negative coverage.

David Lee Simpson, 48, also allegedly described in graphic detail how he would kill another Turner Broadcasting anchor, Jane Velez-Mitchell, after she also spoke passionately about Arias' guilt.

He allegedly wrote on Twitter in June that he wanted to tie the women to a 'tree naked and leave them to suffer 
all night,' then 'slit their throats'.

'Plot': David Lee Simpson allegedly became so infatuated with convicted killer Jodi Arias that he threatened to kill two Turner anchors who made negative remarks about her while covering her trial

Simpson also allegedly commented 
that he wanted to 'gut [one of the women] like a deer'.

Shortly after making the remarks, he quit his job at an auto repair shop and told colleagues in Bath, New York that he was leaving town and began driving south.

But on July 17, he was arrested at a traffic stop and officers found guns, ammunition, handcuffs, zip ties, binoculars, a police radio and a news article about the shooting in Newtown, KPHO reported.

'This suspect was on his way south with enough weapons in his car to do serious harm to someone,' Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said. 'Fortunately, we acted quickly enough, and in doing so, were able to stop him before anything could transpire.'

Arpaio had began investigating Simpson after he became aware of the remarks.

He told a press conference: 'Evidently, Simpson was infatuated with Jodi Arias. He also told an employee where he worked previously that he wanted the hang the commentator by her feet and gut her like a deer. These were some of the Tweets that came over.'

An indictment that charges Simpson, 48, with three counts of computer tampering and two counts of stalking had not yet been made publicly available late Monday afternoon.

Simpson also is accused of threatening a Phoenix woman who defended the anchors online.

The sheriff said investigators don't know whether Simpson was intending to carry out his threats, but he said items found in Simpson's vehicle were disturbing.

Obsession: Simpson allegedly became obsessed with Jodi Arias, who could face the death penalty for murder

Victim: She was convicted of killing her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander to death in June 2008

Simpson was expected to be brought to Arizona on Wednesday, Arpaio said. Court records show he does not yet have a lawyer.

On May 8, a Maricopa County jury convicted Arias of murder in the death of her boyfriend Travis Alexander. He had been stabbed 27 times, his throat slit open and was shot in the head at his Arizona home in June 2008.

Throughout the 18-day trial, Arias, 33, maintained that the killing was in self-defense.

The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether to sentence the former waitress to life in prison or death.

While her murder conviction stands, prosecutors must now decide whether to try again for a death sentence with a new jury or to settle for life in prison.

Cache: Investigators found several guns, handcuffs, zip
ties and a news clipping about last December's mass shooting in 
Newtown, Connecticut, in Simpson's car

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said told the media Simpson was evidently 'infatuated' with Jodi Arias

In court filings, prosecutors have asked the judge to begin new penalty-phase proceedings on July 30.

But defense attorneys asked that the proceedings be delayed until January because of scheduling conflicts and the possibility that Arias might want to call witnesses to speak on her behalf.

A new hearing was set last week for August 26, giving Arias' lawyers additional time to file motions as want the jury's finding that made her eligible for the death penalty vacated.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
