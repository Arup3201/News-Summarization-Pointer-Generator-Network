A beach-goer has complained she was sexually harassed by a pervert using a flying drone to spy on women.

The unnamed woman claimed she was sunbathing on a private, residential beach in Virginia Beach, Virginia, when the incident happened.

Posting on Reddit, she said: 'We heard this whirring noise above us, and I looked up and saw a remote-controlled plane - one of the square ones that can move really articulately in all directions.

'No big deal. I turned back down and napped more.

'Then I noticed: A. It was getting really close to women. Like, straight up in their asses close, flying really low, staying there for probably three minutes at a time; and B. It had a camera on it.'

Then she realized what was happening: The women at the beach were being spied on by a remote-controlled drone.

In an email to the Daily Dot, she added that the 2ft by 2ft drone was making other women at the beach uncomfortable.

She told how she walked up to the man operating the drone and said: 'That is seriously creepy.'

The incident happened on a beach in the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, according to the Reddit post

He replied: 'It isn't going to hurt you.'

And then, getting angry she said: 'I'm not worried about my PERSONAL SAFETY, though I am now worried a bit for YOURS. Your drone is creepy and violating. You need to take it out of the air, or I will.'

Eventually, the woman convinced the drone pilot to pack up his gear and leave the beach.

After the incident, she claimed drone should be banned in public places.

'Unless it's there for recording a public event, there is no place for that sort of thing,' she said. 'At the least, it is a sound annoyance (the buzzing). At the worst, it is a personal violation.'
