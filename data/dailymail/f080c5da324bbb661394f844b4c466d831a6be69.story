A mother says she will have to take eight buses to get her four-year-old to a school located just two miles away.

Janine Micklefield, 38, is unable to drive her son to school because she suffers from a brain condition, while her husband David, 42, works full time.

And she says the route to Allerton Bywater Primary School in Castleford, Yorkshire, which runs across fields and rivers, is too dangerous to walk.

Janine Micklefield, 38, with son Samuel, four, (right) and  and Amy Shillito and sons Logan, four, and Hunter, nine months, says she will have to take eight buses to school and back

Instead, Mrs Micklefield, who works in shop, says she will have to take eight buses each day to take and collect her son Samuel from school.

The journey will involve catching the 168 and 189 from Methley to Allerton Bywater, or the 410 and 168 from Methley to Rothwell to Allerton Bywater.

Mrs Micklefield, who works in a shop, said: ‘It is going to be really difficult to get Samuel up and ready for school in the morning - and it will mean his day lasts from about 7am to 5pm.’

She said she applied for Samuel’s place at Methley Primary School - where his siblings, father and grandfather went - early.

The school is just a five-minute walk from her 
home in St Margaret's Road, Methley.

The route shows the journey across fields and rivers from Mrs Micklefield's home in St Margaret's Road to Allerton Bywater Primary School. She had hoped to get a place at Methley Primary School

So she was shocked when the council contacted her after the deadline date and told her she needed to submit her application.

After
 sending what she says is a second application, she was told the bad 
news that Samuel wouldn’t be able to attend the desired village school.

She said: ‘My husband works full time so he can’t do the school run and I am unable to get my driving licence because of my condition, which means I faint unexpectedly.

‘Technically the school is only two miles away from our house, but that route means we would have to walk across fields and over a river. It just isn’t safe.

‘It could be really dangerous, especially in the winter as there is no public footpath or street lighting and if I had to go on my own to pick him up I wouldn’t feel safe.’

Janine Micklefield, 38, with son Samuel, four, and her husband David, 42, cannot drive because of a brain condition

Paul Brennan, deputy director of children’s services for Leeds City Council, said there had been an unusually high demand for places in the area this year.

He said: ‘We are aware that a number of parents in Methley have expressed concerns about securing places at local schools and we are working hard to address this.

‘This year has seen us managing an unusually high demand for places in the area which we anticipate will fall next year.

‘We will continue to talk to local schools about possible expansion and will do all we can to support parents to get places in a good school as close as possible to their home.’
