Rory 
McIlroy has kept his mobile phone switched off and given his laptop 
away. 'It's like I have been living in the seventies these last few 
days,' he said.

In his first round since his bombshell split from his fiancee Caroline
 Wozniacki, he kept the surprises coming by shooting in the sixties - a 
four under par 68 to be precise in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth
 on Thursday.

Caroline Wozniacki will head into French Open action nursing a broken heart and a dodgy left knee. Rory McIlroy’s ex-fiancee has had knee trouble for a while.

She tweeted: ‘It’s a hard time for me right now. Thanks for all the sweet messages! Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I’ll never walk alone.’

It still left him some distance behind the leader Thomas Bjorn, who 
shot an astounding 62, but this was some effort, given all the 
circumstances.

'Everyone
 know what it feels like,' said the 25 year old. 'It's tough. You're not
 sleeping and I'm not comfortable standing here talking about it. But 
the object now is to bury my head in my golf and for the most part I did
 a pretty good job of that.'

He
 certainly did, from the moment he had stood in the middle of the 
seventh fairway with his arms aloft and his face bathed in smiles. 
Amazing what a holed wedge shot from 130 yards for an eagle two can do 
to lift the spirits of a man.

'Wear black for Mac' was the theme of the opening day  – the players 
were paying their respects to the popular caddie Iain McGregor, who died
 doing the job he loved in Madeira recently – and suddenly, the 
predominant mood of this particular Mac was anything but black.

How
 he seized on that enormous slice of good fortune. His approach had 
actually pitched 35ft beyond the flag before spinning back into the 
hole.    

Five
 holes later he almost came up with an even more spectacular blow, as 
his five iron approach from 203 yards to the par five 12th finished 
three inches away. It was certainly a much better shot. 

'I've
 not had an albatoss,' he said. 'It would have been nice if it had gone 
in, since it's the one thing in golf my dad still has on me. He's had 
one.'

Those
 two eagles took McIlroy to four under and on the leaderboard. He might 
be struggling with commitment off the course but there was no doubting 
his commitment to capitalise and return a morale-boosting score.

After
 all his problems here since the controversial changes were instigated 
in 2010 – he's not finished in the top 20 since  – wouldn't it be ironic
 if this was the year he won the European tour's flagship event? Not 
that he's thinking that way just yet, of course. 'My golf is good enough
 but right now I' d still be happy simply being around for the weekend,'
 he said. 

A
 sense of black humour was needed at the start. Itching for the relative
 quiet of a round inside the ropes, what happened when he got the hoopla
 of the opening hole out of the way? The siren blew heralding a 
suspension of play owing to some electrical activity in the area.

The
 heavy showers that punctuated the day's proceedings actually helped 
McIlroy when he got back out, softening the greens and turning it into a
 target golf test. No-one prospered quite like Europe's renaissance man,
 Bjorn.

In
 a game where perfection isn't possible it's hardly surprising players 
invariably finish even great rounds thinking it could still have been 
one or two shots better. Not Bjorn on this day.

This was the 1,421st round of his long and distinguished European Tour career, and he had no trouble ranking it.

'It's the best one,' he said. 'Absolutely. To shoot 62 on this golf course, you couldn't ask for more.'

Yet
 Bjorn had started out with low expectations. The Dane played horribly 
in Spain last week and admitted his patience was fraying at the edges 
when he continued to struggle in practice here. To complete the picture,
 his pitiful record at Wentworth showed just one top ten in 16 previous 
appearances.

How
 to explain what happened next, as one of the great ball strikers of the
 last 20 years gave a consummate demonstration of his class? 'I don't 
really know where to start,' he said. 'With my record here and after 
last week, I certainly didn't come here thinking, oh this is going to be
 a great week. I guess I've got to stick my head down now and focus on 
what lies ahead.'

What
 lies ahead is the prospect of removing any lingering uncertainty 
regarding his Ryder Cup place, although there's not much of that given 
he  lies third in the qualifying table. He can also consolidate his 
position as leader in the Race to Dubai.

After
 a couple of lean years, why is it all going right again for the 43 year
 old? 'Hard work and determination not to let a golf career fade away,' 
he said. 'You get to that stage in your life where you can see the end 
and you've got to make decisions. It didn't take me long to decide I 
wanted to enjoy this last bit, and I'll continue to work hard and enjoy 
it for as long as my body allows.'

Elsewhere,
 Justin Rose showed the pride of a major champion to card a 70 after 
starting with three straight bogeys while Ian Poulter, labouring all 
week with a bad back, matched him. Luke Donald and Lee Westwood shot 71 
but not everyone enjoyed themselves. Defending champion Matteo Manassero
 tumbled to an 80.
