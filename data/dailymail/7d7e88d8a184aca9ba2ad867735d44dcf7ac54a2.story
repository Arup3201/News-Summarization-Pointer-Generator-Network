Furious parents have been banned from attending their own children's sports day for fear of causing their offspring stress.

Staff at Kenningtons Primary Academy in Aveley, Essex wrote to parents saying the annual sports day would be for 'children only' and that parents should not attend the event.

The letter from headteacher Miss Jo Sawtell said: 'Last year, we were not able to accommodate parents as the field was waterlogged and some of the activities took place inside.

'For lots of children, sports day is a very stressful occasion. This is invariably linked to being watched by a large crowd.

'All decisions are primarily taken with the interests of children at heart.'

But Sue Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for the Association for Physical Education, criticised the decision.

She said: 'We would like to see parents engage right across the educational spectrum. We would actively encourage parents to be part of their children's education.'

A group of mothers are angry at being barred from the event, with some threatening to ban their children from competing.

One mother, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Quite a few of us are upset about it. We are fuming.

'I have got friends who are teachers and they say they are crying out for parents that want to get involved.

'I did not realise wanting to get involved in the sports day would brand us bad parents.'

She added: 'I am keeping my children off school that day and I know other mums that are.

'We will recreate their sports day if needs be.

'The letter says sports day is very stressful for children because of the crowds watching.

"But they are inviting parents from other schools to see another sports day the next day - even though we are not allowed to our own kids' sports day.'

Parents have organised a meeting to discuss the ban.
