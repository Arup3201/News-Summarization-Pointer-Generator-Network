American lingerie line Victoria’s Secret sparked controversy last week with its latest campaign, which has a line-up of super-skinny models next to the slogan ‘The perfect body’. 

Does it promote an unrealistic body shape, fuelling low self-esteem and eating disorders? Probably – but it’s just a drop in the ocean of airbrushed images of doll-like perfection that bombard us every day.

The fact is, not even the VS Angels are born like that. Their fashion show comes to the UK next month, and models such as Adriana Lima and Doutzen Kroes will follow a gruelling diet and workout schedule to prepare.

They’ve been open about the extremes they go to, dispelling any notion they just flop out of bed and into a pair of diamante knickers. Lima admitted to living on meal replacement shakes for nine days before she hits the catwalk.

There’s even a training camp for them in Tulum, Mexico, led by Michael Olajide Jr, the former boxer behind the 1,000-calorie workout. 

It involves up to five hours of exercise a day. No wonder these girls are known as the athletes of the modelling world. The fashion ‘diet’ of cigarettes and coffee seems to have been replaced, thankfully – but is this new version any healthier?

Why I've fallen for park runs 

No wonder they choose this time of year for the New York marathon, which takes place today. I usually hate running, but the fall weather is so nice in NYC that I’ve been inspired to get outside and jog around my local park.

Not only does it feel refreshing to mix up my usual routine with something different, but there are all sorts of benefits to exercising outdoors. 

You increase your workload by up to ten per cent by running outside compared to on the treadmill, and the constantly changing environment maximises the co-ordination between your muscles and your nervous system.

As most of us are Vitamin D-deficient, any activity that means more exposure to sunlight is surely a good thing.

Fuel up before hitting the gym 

Q: I’m always starving after exercise and find myself craving chips, chocolate and everything I know I shouldn’t be eating. Do you have any tips for helping me avoid this?

A: Feeling hungry right after you work out could be a sign that you’re not fuelling up properly before you hit the gym.

Sports dietician Marni Sumbal recommends a small carb-based snack about 45 to 60 minutes before your workout: ‘Try eating half a piece of pita bread with a teaspoon of peanut butter, or a small banana and a few nuts.’

You could also be mistaking thirst for hunger – especially if you’re craving salty foods such as chips. If you do work out on a regular basis, you need to up your overall water intake to reflect this and could also experiment with a home-made electrolyte drink to sip in the gym – simply add a pinch of sea salt and a squeeze of fresh lime to your regular water bottle.

Drinking coconut water after your workout will also help replace the electrolytes you lose in your sweat, and satisfy your sweet tooth for very few calories, too.

Most importantly, though, you shouldn’t try to fight these cravings as ignoring your hunger is a sure-fire way to set yourself up for a binge later in the day. But instead of reaching for the nearest chocolate bar, my nutritionist Gena Hemshaw suggests seeking out natural sources of sugar and salt.

‘For a sweet post-workout treat, I love to have two pitted Medjool dates stuffed with almond butter. And if you’re craving something salty, how about some chickpeas roasted in coconut oil, sea salt and pepper. This snack is a fabulous source of protein, fat, sodium, and complex carbohydrates,’ she says.

Taking a little more effort to have these kinds of snacks on hand after your workout is well worth the effort.

But remember you can also time your workout so that it’s time for one of your proper meals when you finish. Exercising right before lunch or dinner means you can tuck in to your heart’s content.

You might have seen enough of pumpkins for one year, but the word in the wellness world is that pumpkin seed oil (PSO) is acquiring superfood status. 

Packed with Vitamins A and E, zinc, omega-3 and 6, fatty acids and antioxidants, PSO has benefits for hair, skin and diet – and it’s showing up on menus and in beauty products everywhere.

The juicing backlash has begun on my side of the pond, over sugar content. 

Latest government guidelines recommend fewer than 25g of sugar per day, while the famous Doctor Green Juice at cult outlet Juice Press contains 38g – one gram less than a can of Coke here. Next big thing? Green smoothies, which are higher in fibre.
