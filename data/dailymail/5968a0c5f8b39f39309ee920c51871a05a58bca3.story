The sight of Colin Firth in a wet white shirt left millions of women swooning and transformed the actor into a household name.

Playing the brooding Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, he dived into a lake and swam underwater before emerging with his clothes dripping and clinging to his body.

But the screenwriter of the BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel has now revealed that the ‘wet shirt scene’ should have actually been the ‘Mr Darcy full-frontal nudity scene’.

Andrew Davies said the 'wet shirt' scene with Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice was intended as the 'Mr Darcy full-frontal nudity scene' but the shirt was added later

The writer said he wanted to reveal Mr Darcy's 'animal' side by showing him diving into the lake

Andrew Davies said he did not know why the shirt was introduced but that it might be because Colin Firth was trying to hide his ‘love handles’.

‘I intended it as a funny little scene about social embarrassment,’ Mr Davies said.

‘Here are two people and one is soaking wet and neither of them refers to it.

‘In fact it seems to have affected women in quite a different way - and who am I to complain?’

He said he wanted to show Darcy’s ‘animal’ side by having him dive naked into a lake.

‘The wet shirt scene was intended to be total male frontal nudity because that was how guys went bathing in those days. But it was not for titillation - it was about nature and culture, to put it in a very grand way,’ he added.

‘It was my notion that Darcy was an actual man but he spent all his time being constrained by the demands of society.

Colin Firth has filmed nude scenes since, such as this one in Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You

Mr Davies said the famous scene was about 'social embarrassment'

‘In those particular circumstances he had just spent weeks and months in London being polite with a group of very stuffy people, he was about to host a house party for the same stuffy group of people and he had a few hours in which he could be blissfully alone.

‘He could be blissfully himself. It was a hot day. He arrives at his lake. There is nobody to stop him. It is his property. I thought he would strip off completely and dive into that other element and become just a creature, an animal for once.

‘I don’t know the reason why it (the shirt) came to be. Maybe it was felt it would take too long to get him dressed, although they could have just shown him diving in naked and then cut to later.

‘It may have been something about Colin’s anxiety about love handles or something.’

He told the audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival that he had deliberately written physical elements into the screenplay of the Austen classic.

‘I had a kind of project to try to emphasise that these people have bodies as well as brains and little bits of wit and irony and so on,’ he said.

‘I devised as many scenes as possible in which people were getting dressed, getting undressed, having a bath, girls combing their hair - what we call hair and shoulder scenes.’

It has previously been revealed that Colin Firth never actually dived during filming.

A stuntman performed the dive amid health and safety fears that the actor might catch a water-borne disease from the lake.

And footage of him swimming underwater was actually filmed in a tank at Ealing Studios in West London, hundreds of miles from Lyme Park in Cheshire which was the location for Pemberley in the 1995 BBC adaptation.
