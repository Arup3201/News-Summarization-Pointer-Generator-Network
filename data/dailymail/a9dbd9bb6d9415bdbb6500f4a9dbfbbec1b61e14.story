For Jordan Henderson, the road to Rio has been a road to redemption.

From a disappointing England debut, a big-money move that threatened to go awry and an unflattering cameo in Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography, he has returned to Roy Hodgson’s plans with a timely late run.

Henderson’s rapid progress and his midfield understanding with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard mean he is likely to play a vital role for Hodgson in Brazil.

It would complete the circle neatly if he were to start the first group game against Italy in Manaus, a year after he captained the country in a disastrous European Under 21 Championship.

‘There was no dressing it up; we didn’t do as well as we should have done,’ said Henderson. ‘I looked at myself and what I could’ve done but quickly shifted focus on to helping Liverpool have a good season.’

He became a driving force in the team who pushed Manchester City closest for the title. Many believe Liverpool would not have thrown the title away had Henderson not missed three of the final four games after a red card against City.

It was one more setback, but he is strong on the rebound. Two years ago, as a late call-up for Euro 2012, he suffered a tweet from Joey Barton, who claimed: ‘If Henderson is in, any Englishman not currently in the squad can feel aggrieved.’

Then Fergie questioned his peculiar gait and running style. ‘It was a bit strange,’ said Henderson. ‘I didn’t buy the book but I read what it said and I took it as a bit of a compliment because he said he was watching me and thinking about buying me.’

United didn’t buy him but Liverpool paid £16million to Sunderland in 2011, although Brendan Rodgers was prepared to sell him to Fulham two years ago. If that move had gone through, Henderson would have been preparing for the road to Rotherham in the Championship.

Middle man: Henderson could partner Gerrard in midfield for England

There was advice and support from Gerrard and sessions with Liverpool sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, who will be with the England squad in Brazil, to rebuild his confidence.

‘In football you are going to have times where you have got to be strong,’ said Henderson. ‘I always believed I was good enough to be playing for Liverpool and England.

‘Going to Liverpool, you expect to play well every week and that was new for me, the hardest thing to deal with. The big players at Liverpool help you a lot but you have to deal with stuff on your own.’

Over time he convinced Rodgers. ‘I was performing well; the gaffer just kept playing me,' he said.

An England recall followed. Despite not playing in the qualifying campaign, Hodgson picked him to start a friendly against Denmark in March. It was his first full cap since his debut under Fabio Capello in 2010.

‘I was more mature,’ he said. ‘I felt as if I’d improved from then until Denmark. I was only 20 when I made my debut. It was a hard game. From then until Denmark I felt as if I’d improved. I was a different person really.’
