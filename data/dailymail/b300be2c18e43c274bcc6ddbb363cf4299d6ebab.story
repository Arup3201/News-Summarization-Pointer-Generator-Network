Baristas whose tips were robbed from the counter have decided to save the thief a run-in with police and in true Christmas spirit, organize a food drive for him instead.Â 

Staff at the Nervous Dog Coffee Bar in Stow, Ohio, announced they would hold a food-drive for the man this week rather than file a police report against him.

Surveillance footage from the store shows the stranger order a coffee from a young barista, then when her back is turned, dip his hand into the tip jar and stuff as much cash as possible into his pocket.

However the kindhearted staff decided the desperate man needed their compassion instead of a visit from the police.

The coffee shop posted the surveillance tape on its Facebook page, with the words : 'We figured anyone desperate enough to steal a few bucks from a kid working her way through college, is likely pretty hungry.

'If anyone is able to help us find this unfortunate man, we will make the donations available to him Christmas week.

'We will also provide him with free brewed coffee for the remainder of this year. If he is unable to get to the shop again in order to pick up the food, we are happy to drop it off if anyone can help us locate the hungry fellow.'

The staff held a food drive for the man at their coffee shops in Stow and Akron and so far have collected three boxes of food.

The first person to offer a donation was the barista who was working when the thief stole the tips.

Manager Scott Moses told wkyc if the man comes forward, the food will be given to him with no questions asked.

He added: 'We are trying to show awareness that people are going through hard times.'

If the man does not come forward, the donations will be donated to a local food bank.
