With 24m Twitter followers and 85m Facebook fans, there's no doubt that Rihanna is one of the world's most influential stars.

And now, the Barbadian singer is using her popularity to raise awareness for AIDS.

Rihanna, 25, is the new face of Viva Glam by MAC - a make-up collection that donates every penny of the selling price to help women, men and children living with and affected by AIDS.

Viva Glam: Songstress Rihanna, who already has her own range of cosmetics with MAC, is the new face of the charity collection which donates all proceeds to help fight AIDS

The singer showcases her platinum cropped locks in a topless campaign - wearing nothing save for a slick of red Viva Glam lipstick.

Speaking about her new campaign, Rihanna said: 'I'm honored to join forces with the MAC Aids Fund and UNAIDS in the fight against AIDS.

'I want to help reach as many young people around the world as I can.'

Red hot: Rihanna has created a £15 lipstick and £14 lipglass in two strikingly bold shades of red that 'perfectly captures her fearless, confident style', says the brand

Speaking about the £15 lipstick and £14 lipglass, a spokesperson for MAC said: 'Rihanna launches our new MAC Viva Glam with two strikingly bold shades of red frosted lipstick and lipglass, perfectly capturing her fearless, confident style.'

The MAC makeup brand was established by 
two gay men from Toronto back in 1985.

They added the Viva Glam campaign in 1994 to raise 
money for some dying friends, according to Estée 
Lauder, which bought MAC in 1995.

Beauty and brains: Rihanna has unveiled several collections with the beauty giant, which have all sold out in record time

Rihanna follows in the footsteps of her famous friends Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga, who have also fronted the charitable campaign.

A spokesperson for the cosmetics giant says they hope having Rihanna on board will boost awareness.

It seems like they'll have no trouble if the singer's recent collaborations are anything to go by; her cult red RiRi Woo lipstick sold out in just three hours.
