A mother-of-two has helped hundreds of women beat infertility through foot rubs and reiki massage.

Victoria Miles, 38, from Cardiff, says 300 babies have been born in the past five years after they've had treatment at her Baby Farm Wales natural fertility clinic thanks to an ancient Chinese massage technique.

She says the key is finding the 'pregnant foot', the patch below the ankle bone that relates to pregnancy.

A former car saleswoman, Victoria learned reflexology when she was bored at home after having her first child. 

After becoming a qualified reflexology practitioner, she helped friends but now her hobby has become a business.

As well as the £60 foot massage technique she concentrates on 'changing the mindset' of couples, many of whom have spent years trying to conceive without success.

Reflexology works on the basis that every area on the sole of the foot corresponds to an organ in the body so touching those places on the feet can help improve specific health problems. 

Victoria, based in Efail Isaf near Llantwit Fardre, said: 'We're a nation of brilliant, hard-working, often very organised people but so many of us leave having children to the last minute which can lead to problems..

'We also have very full-on lives, partying hard and working hard the next day.

'It can lead to a lot of stress and when couples try for a baby without success, say for a year or two years, they convince themselves they are not going to conceive. It can be a vicious circle.

'What I do when people first come to me is give them a basic assessment, see if they are suitable for reflexology and work with them, helping them to relax, making them think they can conceive.

She says the services at Baby Farm Wales can make couples sleep better, feel more positive and even increase their sex drives.

'What I do is half life coaching and half reflexology and I also have a network of people like psychologists, if clients have difficult emotional problems, and reiki and other practitioners,' Victoria said:

'I find that by relaxing and de-stressing women and their partners it can lead to re-balancing of the hormones.

Clients feel, '100 per cent more positive,  relaxed, sleep better, have improved sex drive and more regular cycles'.

Victoria said: 'I've become friends with many of my clients. You form a bond and when a baby is born, that bond becomes much, much stronger.

'I work with men and women and even have some male-only clients.

'One needed help after a breakdown and got to a state in which he could not have intimacy, which is pretty basic for having babies, and I was able to help him reach a state where he could.

'The success stories make you feel good. It's a job I love doing.'

But there is a limit to the women she can help. She said: 'The only people I can't work with are those with "transport" problems such as fallopian tube issues but I have had successes with people who have had endometriosis and a whole host of other problems.

One her clients is Rebecca Jones, from Cardiff, who had fertility problems caused by endometriosis, a condition in which uterine cells grow outside the womb.

Victoria's complementary therapies have even helped infertile couples improve their sleep and sex drives 

Doctors told her she'd never conceive but within a few months of seeing Victoria she was pregnant with her miracle daughter Georgie, now six. 

Meanwhile an obese couple who'd been declined NHS treatment unless they lost 10 stone between them, were referred to Victoria in 2011.

Victoria said: 'I started a treatment plan and we had a positive pregnancy test within a month, after three treatments.'

Around one in six couples can have difficulty conceiving. That is approximately 3.5 million people in the UK.

About 85 per cent of couples will conceive naturally within a year if they have regular unprotected sex but the chance of becoming pregnant is much lower for women over 36.

Rebecca Jones, from Cardiff, conceived her miracle child after going to Baby Farm Wales customer.  

Rebecca was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 25.

''I was told if I wanted to be a mum I needed to come off the pill and start trying as soon as possible as the disease would significantly hamper my fertility and chances of conception,' she said.

She tried to conceive unsuccessfully for several years and endured the pain and side-effects of the hormones needed.

She also lost her job after taking time off work for keyhole surgery to tackle her endometriosis so she started looking for holistic alternatives.

'It was at this point I discovered the benefits of reflexology for fertility and well-being and was recommended the services of Baby Farm Wales,' said Rebecca.

'During my treatment, I underwent the second laparoscopy to release my ovary which was stuck down fast in my abdomen.

'The surgeon managed to unstick this successfully but told me my right tube was damaged and blocked and needed to be removed. 

I was devastated as I had been trying to conceive for nearly eight years at that point without any luck.

'Now I would surely have 50 per cent less chance with only one tube.'

But she says the operation went ahead and she continued with the  reflexology with Baby Farm Wales.

'To my delight I got pregnant naturally and finally had the baby I always dreamed of.

'I spent nearly eight years of healthy eating, cutting out certain things, eating foods to enrich fertility, supplements, operations, fertility treatment with no success.

'And I'm now blessed with the gift of being a mum after a long struggle during which time doctors told me to have a hysterectomy and to take a number of aggressive drugs.'
