With its tranquil blue waters, palm trees and rock pools, this idyllic river in the Philippines is nothing short of paradise.

But the Hinatuan River, which runs on the island of Mindanao - the second largest and southernmost in the region - is no ordinaryÂ hideaway.

Because the salt water river seems to have no source.

Peaceful: The Hinatuan River in the Philippines is one of a kind - because it appears to have no source

Idyll: The 50ft deep waters are popular with sunbathers, swimmers and those who wish to practice their diving skills

The exact source of the beautiful paradise - nicknamed the Enchanted River because of its unknown beginnings - is surrounded in mystery and has never been determined.

Due to its close proximity to the sea, some believe the idyll was created when seawater flowed through long tunnels and caverns deep below the ground, finally resurfacing at the spring - which is 50ft deep in areas.

But others offer slightly different solutions - including one urban legend that suggests the river was created by fairies and pixies.

The river, considered one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in the Philippines flows straight into the Pacific Ocean at Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur.

The area's deep waters and boulders to dive from see tourists travel from miles around to bathe in its virtually clear waters.

With numerous fishes and other creatures living in its deep waters, the area is popular with snorkelers as well as divers and explorers.

And if swimming is not your thing, the area can be viewed from dry land on the metres of ricekerty woodern viewing bridges that surround the water's edge.
