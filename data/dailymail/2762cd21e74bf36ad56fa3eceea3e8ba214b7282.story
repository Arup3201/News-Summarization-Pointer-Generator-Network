Rock samples that date three quarters of the way back to the birth of our planet suggest life may have flourished on early Earth.

Chemical evidence hints that early microbes may have ‘crawled’ out of the ocean and lived on land by 'pulling' nitrogen from the air 3.2 billion years ago.

It was previously thought that the ability to use atmospheric nitrogen to support more widespread life appeared much later - roughly two billion years ago.

While life can exist without oxygen, it needs nitrogen to build genes - essential to viruses, bacteria and all other organisms. Without it, life on Earth would have been scarce.

'People always had the idea that the really ancient biosphere was just tenuously clinging on to this inhospitable planet, and it wasn't until the emergence of nitrogen fixation that suddenly the biosphere become large and robust and diverse,’ explained Roger Buick, professor of Earth and space sciences at the University of Washington.

‘Our work shows that there was no nitrogen crisis on the early Earth, and therefore it could have supported a fairly large and diverse biosphere.’

Researchers analysed some of the oldest and best-preserved rocks on the planet.

The samples ranged in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old and were collected in South Africa and north western Australia, according to the study published in Nature.

The rocks were formed from sediment deposited on continental margins, so are free from chemical irregularities that would occur near a subsea volcano, for example.

They also formed before the atmosphere gained oxygen, roughly 2.3 to 2.4 billion years ago, and therefore preserve chemical clues that have disappeared in modern rocks.

The oldest samples showed chemical evidence that life was pulling nitrogen out of the air.

A prehistoric sea creature living almost 250 million years ago, which was discovered near Shanghai in China, is believed to be the first amphibious ichthyosaur - reptiles that could live both in and out of the water.

The predators roamed Earth at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures.

However, there were no fossils marking this transition until the new species was unearthed.

The ancient marine reptile called Cartorhynchus lenticarpus, with seal-like flippers, may have been adapted to life on the land as well as in the sea, scientists believe.

They are thought to have had terrestrial ancestors, but previously no fossils had come to light marking the transition of ichthyosaurs from land to sea.

At 1.5ft (0.46 metres) long, Cartorhynchus lenticarpus was also the smallest known ichthyosaur, meaning fish lizard.

The ratio of heavier to lighter nitrogen atoms fits the pattern of nitrogen-fixing enzymes contained in single-celled organisms, but does not match any chemical reactions that occur in the absence of life.

Lead author Eva Stüeken said: ‘Imagining that this really complicated process is so old, and has operated in the same way for 3.2 billion years, I think is fascinating.

‘It suggests that these really complicated enzymes apparently formed really early, so maybe it's not so difficult for these enzymes to evolve’

Previous genetic analysis of nitrogen-fixing enzymes placed their origin at between 1.5 and 2.2 billion years ago.

Professor Buick said: ‘This is hard evidence that pushes it back a further billion years.’

Fixing nitrogen means breaking a tenacious triple bond, which holds nitrogen atoms in pairs in the atmosphere, and joining a single nitrogen to a molecule that is easier for living things to use.

The chemical signature of the rocks suggests that nitrogen was being broken by an enzyme based on molybdenum. 

Molybdenum is the most common of the three types of nitrogen-fixing enzymes that exist today.

Molybdenum is now abundant because oxygen reacts with rocks to wash it into the ocean, but its source on ancient Earth - before the atmosphere contained oxygen to weather rocks - is more mysterious.

The authors suggest that its presence may be further evidence that some early life could have existed in single-celled layers on land, exhaling small amounts of oxygen that reacted with the rock to release molybdenum to the water.

Professor Buick said: ‘We'll never find any direct evidence of land scum one cell thick, but this might be giving us indirect evidence that the land was inhabited.’

‘Microbes could have crawled out of the ocean and lived in a slime layer on the rocks on land, even before 3.2 billion years ago.’
