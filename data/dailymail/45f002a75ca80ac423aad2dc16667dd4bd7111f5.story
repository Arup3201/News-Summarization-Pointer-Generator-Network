Five Italian chefs have smashed the record for the world's largest pizza after baking a 130ft wide margherita.

The team brought the title - previously set by a South African supermarket in 1990 - back to the home country of the popular dish.

Containing 19,800 lbs of flour and 8,800 lbs of tomato sauce, the huge pizza and weighs in at a mega 3.6 stone.

Cooking the margherita was such a logistical problem the chefs had to bake the dough in 5,234 separate batches over 48 hours.

Using specialist equipment the whole pizza was cooked at varied temperatures, from 300 to 500 degrees Celsius.

Named Ottavia - after the first Roman Emperor Augustus - the gluten free pizza also packs in an impressive 19,800 lbs of mozzarella.

What's more, the chefs used 1,500 lbs of margarine, 550 lbs of rock salt, 420 lbs of vegetable oil and 50 lbs of balsamic vinegar.

The pizza - orgainsed by food specialists Dr. Schar - smashed the previous world record set in 1990 in South Africa which measured 122ft in diameter.

Dovilio Nardi, head of the quintet of chefs, said: 'We named the pizza Ottavia to symbolise the hope of a great economic and cultural revival.

'We wanted it to be a symbol of good luck for the recovery of all countries, using the iconic pizza.'

Ulrich Ladurner, president of Dr. Schar Group, said: 'We decided to endorse this record attempt to show how gluten free food no longer restricts diets.

'Cooking 'gluten free' doesn't mean giving up on tasty food such as pizza.'

Slices of the huge Italian delicacy were cut and some were donated to local food shelters in Rome, Italy.
