Spoken out: Jo Swinson, Lib Dem business minister who gave birth before Christmas, is calling for a change

MPs with newborn babies should be able to bring them into the House of Commons for votes because they would not be a disruption, a minister has claimed.

Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat business minister who gave birth to a boy before Christmas, said the ban on bringing infants to the voting lobby was ‘bizarre’.

A parliamentarian who is breastfeeding may bring a baby into their own office, but not into the House of Commons or House of Lords chambers, or the division lobbies they pass through to vote.

Miss Swinson, who is married to fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames, suggested the rules were archaic, saying: ‘I hardly think it would be too much of a disruption. You can take a sword through there but you can’t a baby.’

No one other than an MP is allowed through the voting lobby – even a baby.

A special exception was made for David Blunkett’s guide dog, Sadie.

While she is on maternity leave, Miss Swinson, 33, does not get a replacement. Her office staff will look after her constituents in East Dunbartonshire and Lib Dem colleague Jenny Willott will perform her ministerial duties.

In her last interview before going on maternity leave, Miss Swinson said she had a ‘huge amount of support and goodwill’ from colleagues in parliament during her pregnancy, but said: ‘I think some of the structures of the institutions of the House of Commons probably don’t make it as easy as it could be, in particular that you don’t get maternity cover.’

Miss Willott, who gave birth in 2010, complained at the time that when she took her son Toby for late votes, often called at just a few minutes’ notice, she had to hand him ‘to the nearest MP’ who had already voted, and that this happened ‘a couple of times a week’.

Miss Swinson said: ‘I don’t think it’s 
impossible or insurmountable but I don’t think there’s any job that’s 
particularly easy to have a baby when you’re in it.

'There’s always going to be a lot of challenges and there’s plenty of people who have jobs with even more difficult challenges, like people who are self-employed and running a business.

‘There has been a change that women who are breastfeeding can be nodded through.

'But I think when you are perfectly capable of walking through the lobby holding a small baby, I think there would be a better way of just allowing that. But parliament moves but slowly.’

Miss Swinson announced the birth of her son on Twitter on Christmas Eve.

She wrote: ‘Duncan & I delighted to welcome our son Andrew Lennox Marshall Hames to the world on Sun 22 Dec, weight 7lb 10oz, all tired but v.happy!’.

The MP, here with Nick Clegg, calls the policy a hangover of the 'guilt culture' of women working

Mr Hames has given up his role as an aide to leader Nick Clegg to spend more time with his son. Miss Swinson, also responsible for equalities, said new parents should do what instinctively feels right and not worry if they follow official guidance to the letter.

She said: ‘I think we need to get away from this guilt culture in terms of judging other people’s decisions as parents.’

Employers must carry out a risk assessment to establish whether pregnant or breastfeeding  women can continue to work. If they can, the employers have a legal obligation to provide suitable rest facilities. Parliament  has a creche for MPs, peers and staff which is usually open until 6pm.

In 2000, a bid to allow breastfeeding in the Commons was blocked by the then Speaker Betty Boothroyd.
