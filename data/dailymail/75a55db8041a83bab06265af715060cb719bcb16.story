A mother has given birth to a 10lb 7oz baby on her kitchen floor.

Becci Woodward gave birth to Noah at home after her waters broke suddenly.

Her partner, Aaron Allport, had to act as the midwife as Noah was born before help arrived.

Baby Noah weighed 3lb more than the average 7lb 8oz new born baby.

Ms Woodward, 28, was hoping to have her second child at Colchester General Hospital, in Essex, but she went into labour at home in Marks Tey, Essex, yesterday and ended up having Noah on the kitchen floor.

Ms Woodward, who is now recovering at home, said: ‘I'm feeling very good at the moment. I'm over the moon.

‘It's all a bit of a blur. It was over before I had a chance to panic. It just doesn't feel like it's real. It doesn't feel like it's happened. I'm chuffed to bits.’

Ms Woodward started having strong contractions at about 5am and woke her partner.

The couple called Ms Woodward’s parents, who were due to attend the birth, and started getting ready to go to hospital.

However, just as she put her shoes on, her waters broke and she knew she needed to push.

Her parents arrived at the house and Mr Allport called 999 and an operator talked them through the delivery.

Mr Allport, and Ms Woodward’s mother, Christine, delivered baby Noah at 5.52am.

Mr Allport, 29, said: ‘We were all trying to remain calm but there was a realisation that we would have to step up. You've just got do what you've got to do.

‘We just put a blanket down and a few cushions to make her comfortable. Her mum was fantastic throughout the ordeal.’

Shortly after the birth, two ambulances and a midwife arrived at the house.

They checked mother and baby and found they were both healthy.

Mr Allport said: ‘The emergency services were superb and the midwife was great. I'm overjoyed. We're absolutely elated.

‘It's a great story for when you're down the pub.’

The couple also have a 14-month old baby girl called Isla.

Mr Allport said: ‘Isla slept through the whole thing. When we first introduced her to Noah she didn't quite know what to make of him.’

Noah is not the first big baby to be born recently in the UK.

George King was born naturally in February 2013 weighing an enormous 15lb 7oz.

He was the biggest baby ever to be born in Gloucestershire and was almost twice the weight of an average new born.

By the age of six weeks, he weighed 17lbs and had to wear baby clothes designed for a six month old.

In August, Eva Lily Margerrison was born in Sheffield weighing in at 12lbs 6oz.

She was delivered by emergency Caesarean and her parents, Danica Slaving and Sam Margerrison, nicked named her the 'Whopper'.
