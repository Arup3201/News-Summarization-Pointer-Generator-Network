Customs officers in Hong Kong had their hands full with this haul after seizing 649kg of cocaine - the biggest drugs bust in the city's history.

The staggering haul - which was worth 76m Hong Kong dollars ($98m or Â£63m), was discovered in a shipping container at Hong Kong's port after arriving from Ecuador.

Customs bosses believe the record-breaking shipment was destined for Southeast Asia or mainland China.

What a bust: Hong Kong custom officers say the 649kg haul was the biggest they have ever seized in the city

Haul: It is thought the giant shipment of cocaine was destined for Southeast Asia or China

Biggest ever: The cocaine shipment came in 541 bricks, each weighing 1.2kg

Hong Kong officials said the shipment seized at the city's port had come from Ecuador

The container was one of a batch that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had flagged to Hong Kong officials for further inspection.

Customs officers discovered the drugs after they followed the shipment when it was driven Wednesday from the port to a collection point in Hong Kong's rural New Territories.

It was then picked up by two men that authorities believe are members of a local drug syndicate.

When they inspected the shipment, officers found 541 bricks of cocaine, each weighing about 1.2 kilograms, hidden in a shipment of laurel wood.

The driver and the two men were arrested.

The 649kg haul topped the previous largest shipment by almost 100kg

John Lee, head of the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau said officials are working with South American agencies to combat drug trafficking

John Lee, head of the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau, said Hong Kong's customs department has been working with the DEA and South American law enforcement agencies this year to combat drug trafficking.

The seizure tops a haul last year of 560 kilograms of cocaine worth about $77 million found in a suburban warehouse. Five Mexicans and a Colombian were among the eight people arrested in that case.

On Tuesday, customs officers arrested a man arriving at the airport from Sao Paulo, Brazil, after they discovered 1.9 kilograms of cocaine hidden in specially made underwear and shoes he was wearing.
