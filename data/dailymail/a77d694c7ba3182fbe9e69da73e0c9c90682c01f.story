Ellie Tweed, 18, was killed when she became trapped inside the car which caught fire moments after crashing into a lorry

A teenager who killed a friend in a car crash following an all-night Halloween party said she will ‘never forgive herself’ as she was jailed today.

Eleanor Coleman, 19, had taken ecstasy and cannabis while out celebrating with friends in Norwich town centre wearing fancy dress costumes.

But as she drove home at around 5am her Fiat Punto veered off the road and crashed into the back of a parked lorry.

The car burst into flames and lorry driver Peter Jolly managed to save Coleman’s life by dragging her out of the car moments before it exploded.

He called to passers-by for help, who were able to pull other passengers out of the smashed car, a court heard.

But front seat passenger Ellie Tweed, 18, was trapped inside the burning car and died, Norwich Crown Court heard.

Coleman was given 15 months custody today after she admitted causing the death by careless driving.

Judge Peter Jacobs said: ‘You were tired and not in the mindset to drive at all.

'You will regret this for the rest of your life.’

The horror smash happened on November 1 last year on the A47 in Runham, near Great Yarmouth, Suffolk.

Coleman, who had been partying in Norwich, suffered a head injury and has no recollection of what happened.

Tests showed she had taken ecstasy and cannabis although there was no evidence that was under the influence when the crash happened.

Miss Tweed died inside the Fiant Punto which was unreocognisable after following the crash

It is unknown what caused the crash but the three other passengers received serious injuries and those sitting in the back had not worn seat-belts.

A letter written by Coleman, which was had handed to the judge and read aloud in court, said: ‘I hate myself for everything that has happened and will never forgive myself.’

After the case Steve Matthews of Norfolk Serious Collision investigation team said: ‘These girls have all been left with lasting injuries and severe impairments in some cases, and one has sadly lost her life.

‘A fun night out very quickly turned into a nightmare which has changed forever the lives of those involved and their families and friends and our sympathies remain with them.’

Bright floral tributes were left at the scene of the crash where Miss Tweed died

An emotional tribute from a friend was one of many left for Miss Tweed at at the scene following her death

Inspector David Ball, of Norfolk road policing unit, said: ‘Eleanor Coleman has paid a very high price for driving carelessly.

'I would ask people to think about what happened last Halloween before they head out this year to enjoy festivities.’

Coleman was given 15 months custody in a young offenders’ institution and given a three-year driving ban.

She was also ordered to take an extended driving test before getting back behind the wheel.
