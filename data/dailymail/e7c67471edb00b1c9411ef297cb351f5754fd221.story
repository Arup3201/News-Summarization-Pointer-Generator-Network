Austin Mitchell says the House of Commons, once the playground for Britain’s elite to exercise the great game of power, is now more like a cheap gym

The House of Commons, once the playground for Britain’s elite to exercise the great game of power, is today more like a cut-price gym.

People join hopeful and exhilarated — then find it too difficult and eventually slink off disillusioned.

In the 18th century, Edmund Burke described the Commons as an institution that included the best and most opulent people in Britain.

In 1936, the inter-war MP Col. Josiah Wedgwood claimed its life ‘combines the mental gymnastics of college with the fresh wind of the outer world. Fellow members are the staunchest friends man ever had. There is no other Parliament like the English.’

Sadly, all that’s gone. It’s still a club, but a third-rate one. Its members are our political elite, but they no longer speak the language of Gladstone.

They’re an elite that’s been replaced by arrivistes and middle management types.

The great game of power has become a shouting match between public servants, teachers and social workers on the one side (Labour) and small businessmen and funny money men from the City on the other (Tory), all orchestrated and scripted by apparatchiks from lesser league student politics.

Dismal

David Brent from The Office would be more at home in the Commons than Winston Churchill or Enoch Powell.

I’m standing down at the election after 38 years. Because of age mainly — I was 80 in September. I was elected in the year Virginia Wade won Wimbledon, Red Rum won the Grand National and James Callaghan was Prime Minister.

Comparing those days with now, I can only say the level of debate has sunk dismally — and it was already on the downward slope when I arrived.

We no longer discuss the issues of Empire, of course, because we don’t have one. But the lightning flash of spontaneous free debate that was once taken for granted in the Commons is no longer.

Gladstone used to give three-hour speeches, but today we have time-limited debates in which speakers gabble for five minutes before it’s the next person’s turn. Political minds no longer wrestle with the great issues of the day, or with each other.

Instead, MPs read student essays, often written for them in lamentable grammar, in the hope of getting into their constituencies’s local papers — never the nationals. We should introduce the UK equivalent of the American Congressional Record in which representatives write down their speeches, so they don’t have to say them out loud and bore others waiting to recite their own productions.

The most striking decline in standards has been in Prime Minister’s Questions, which has become a half-hour of custard-pie throwing

The most striking decline in standards has been in Prime Minister’s Questions, which has become a half-hour of custard-pie throwing.

Questions are handed out for MPs to ask: ‘Have you stopped beating the poor?’ from the Left, versus: ‘Isn’t it marvellous news from my constituency where 20 shelf-stacking jobs have been created by Aldi?’ on the Right.

Then the questions receive rehearsed answers, alternating between the Prime Minister replying: ‘Miliband’s a twerp.’ And: ‘Our long-term economic plan is working miracles.’

The first-class brains and the serious thinkers — people such as Labour’s Sixties Education Secretary Tony Crosland, above, the Seventies and Eighties Tory intellectual Ian Gilmour or the outspoken and cerebral Enoch Powell — who once stimulated and excited the Commons, now go into the City, the law, accountancy houses or our huge tax-avoidance industry

Questions to ministers about their departments function at a similar level, as spoon-fed debating points are raised by sycophantic MPs.

As for the debates on legislation or proper issues, which used to be where ministers had to defend their arguments, it’s now rare to hear a speech that makes one think because it’s all agreement and soundbites.

Most speeches toe the party line, usually peppered with cliches such as ‘hard-working families’ or ‘cost of living crisis’.

As an academic snob, my feeling is that is we have fewer firsts today but more bottom seconds from lesser universities. So we lose out in every way.

Public relations has replaced policy and we’ve ended up with fewer serious thinkers but more political obsessives, all of them with less experience of the real world of work.

We’ve also lost the role of providing the national forum of debate to the media, who’ve stolen our job of holding the executive account.

Leech

The old relationship — whereby parliamentary debates created the news and the media reported it — has been reversed. We now take the issues from the media and chase the hares they set running rather than vice versa.

It’s true that, as MPs, we each have a platform from which to ask questions in the Commons, but this is far less important than it used to be because we MPs have lost respect.

Ministerial departments no longer jump to our demands. Privatised utilities and the quasi-departmental firms that leech off government spending — like security firm G4S and the business out-sourcing companies Capita and Serco — fob us off with PR answers. So we’re dependant on getting the interest and support of the media to make the government listen. Then there is the changed working environment. The Commons has always been a club. Now it’s a dull one, where socialising, friendships, mixing and bonding have fallen victim to family-friendly hours.

These have turned the grind of late nights and long debates into a two-and-a-half-day week. Members arrive late on Monday, get as many meetings in as they can, go home Thursday and spend spare evenings watching telly rather than plotting or chatting in the Commons bars.

The lush facilities of Portcullis House, where MPs have their offices, are crowded out during the day with ten o’clock to six o’clock staffers in sharp suits — who know everything from electoral calculus to social security rules better than we do — but are deserted at night. We’ve lost the awkward squad of MPs who tripped up the executive by throwing spanners into its works — people such as Labour’s Tam Dalyell or Tory Eric Forth.

Can’t have the legislative factory disrupted, you see.

None of this, I should add to avoid a deluge of feminist twitterati, is due to the increase in the number of women.

They’ve civilised the place, eliminated the boys’ club sillinesses and brought more realism to debates.

It’s due to the tighter grip of the parties on their MPs and the increase in the number of apparatchiks. From being a training ground for senators, the Commons has become a numbers game dominated by two chanting choruses — one praising, the other criticising the executive steam-roller as it drives over us.

We can still abuse the executive and throw our pre-cooked custard pies, but when the executive makes its biggest mistakes — Iraq, Helmand, Trident, HS2 and 3 — or erodes our liberties for whatever purpose, we can be relied on to rally round.

Paradoxically, the amount of work and number of staff have increased as our influence has declined. We now have more MPs’ committees than ever before — including, joy of my life, the Public Accounts Committee on which I sit.

Trivial

These give MPs a new role and new satisfaction as amateur Perry Masons, but activity isn’t influence. It keeps us busy, but much of what’s raised is trivial.

Select committees have done some good reports, particularly Margaret Hodge’s Public Accounts Committee, but it’s mostly closing doors after horses have bolted and government is much better at apologising and promising than it is at listening and changing.

Perhaps I complain too much. My long career has been a fighting retreat from Social Democracy, Keynesian economic management, the mixed economy and equality before the triumph of neo-liberalism, the EU and free-market economics. I’ve enjoyed it and I’d still like to carry on if I wasn’t so old and decrepit in what’s becoming a youth club.

Yet the fact is MPs today are no longer tribunes of the people, they’re the sewer workers and street cleaners of Britain’s creaking constitution.
