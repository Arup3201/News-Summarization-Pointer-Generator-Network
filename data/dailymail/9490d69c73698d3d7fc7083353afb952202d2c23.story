Aviation ministers are ‘stalling’ over controversial plans to build more runways, angry critics warned today in a new row.

Status quo: Today's announcement will see see noise restrictions extended at Heathrow for three years

It came as Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin kicked into the long grass a recommendation by the Government’s ‘Airports ‘Tsar’ Sir Howard Davies for the creation of a new Independent Aviation Noise Authority - saying a decision on this would be ‘more appropriate’ after next May’s election.

Instead, noise and night-flight restrictions at three of Britain’s busiest airports are to be extended by three years while ministers ponder where to build a controversial new runway.

Existing restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted will continue until October 2017, he said.

Campaigners said the Government’s response was ‘deeply disappointing’, and said Mr McLoughlin had sought to ‘bury’ bad news behind the excitement of today's re-shuffle, and to ‘kick the can down the road for another year’.

They also expressed dismay that the Transport Secretary was ‘stalling’, and had failed to explicitly back the need for at least one extra runway in the South East of England - which Sir Howard’s Airports Commission says is needed.

At close quarters: A decision over a possible third runway at Heathrow has been left hanging by today's news

The argument is over whether it should be at Heathrow, Gatwick or the increasingly unlikely ‘Boris Island’ plan for the Thames Estuary.

But the Commission’s final recommendation on this matter will be left for the winner of next May’s general election to implement – or not.

Announcing the Government’s response to the Airports Commission’s interim report published back in December, Mr McLoughlin told Parliament in a written statement:

‘In relation to the commission’s recommendation for an Independent Aviation Noise Authority, the government believes that it would be more appropriate to consider the role for such a body alongside the commission’s final recommendations on long term capacity.‘

Instead he said:

‘The government is confirming today that we will be maintaining the existing restrictions on night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports for a further three years until October 2017, as well as extending the ban on rare movements made by older, noisier types of aircraft.’

Mr McLoughlin said this decision ‘will help give certainty around the night noise environment for those living near the airports, as well as ensuring that operational capacity at these airports is not affected pending decisions on any new airport capacity in light of the commission’s final report.‘

With an eye to the rows that noise has caused in the past, he said: ‘The government is conscious of the potential concerns of those living near the sites that have been shortlisted for future runway development. However, the government is also mindful that introducing inappropriate measures too early has the potential to increase uncertainty and create other negative outcomes.‘

In the frame: London airports Gatwick and Stansted have also been considered as options for new runways

Decisions on trials of using departure runways for early morning ‘schedule smoothing’ at Heathrow should also be considered later, and ‘in the context of the commission’s recommendations on long term capacity’, he said.

Mr McLoughlin added that the Government has been working with the promoters of the shortlisted runway schemes to determine when ‘blight’ measures might be put in place to address concerns and what these measures could consist of.

Gavin Hayes, director of the ‘Let Britain Fly’ campaign backed by major businesses said:

‘They are stalling. We are disappointed that the Government has failed to make any progress on the early establishment of an independent aircraft noise authority.

‘We think a new body is fundamental to ensuring that we build cross-party support for airport expansion. This should be established as soon as possible.‘

He added: ‘Furthermore instead of bold political leadership, the Government has decided to kick the can down the road for another year.

‘We so desperately need a clear direction of travel and an in-principle commitment to build additional runways to boost our international connectivity and secure future jobs, growth and prosperity. Instead, we have yet more political procrastination.’

Campaigners also accused the minister of trying top ‘bury’ bad news behind the re-shuffle:

‘It is also regrettable that the Government have decided to release a statement on an issue of strategic national importance on the day of the reshuffle. When Patrick McLoughlin created the Airports Commission, he rightly pointed out that 'the reality is that, since the 1960s, Britain has failed to keep pace with our international competitors in addressing long term aviation capacity and connectivity needs', and emphasised the urgent need to put that right.

'Sadly, the only consequence of today's statement is that the UK will drop still further off the pace.’

Baroness Valentine, chief executive of business leaders' group London First, said:

‘After seven months of waiting, the Government has failed to rise to the challenge set by the commission in its interim report’.

She added: ‘It will be over a decade before we have a new runway serving London, if we're lucky, and this was a great chance to hear how the Government will make best use of the airports we have to boost our global reach.

‘Instead we have no short-term plans to make the rail link to Stansted world-class, and no plans to attract airlines and passengers to grow our global air links.’

Lady Valentine continued: ‘There is no detail about an independent aviation noise authority, to bring new levels of trust around airports that more flights will mean less noise, and no certainty over proposals to cut flight delays at Heathrow.’

Mr Mcloughlin said the Senior Delivery Group (SDG), whose first report is also published today, was setting pit plans expected to deliver annual benefits of more than £150million to the aviation industry and environment by 2020, and more than £2billion worth of cumulative benefits by 2030.

Mr McLoughlin said: ‘We are taking steps now to make the best use of what we already have, and looking at what more can be done in the short to medium term while the Airports Commission prepares its recommendations on the best options in the long run.

‘As we have said before, it will be for the government of the day to respond to the commission's recommendations once it publishes its final report in summer 2015.’

The Government set up the Airports Commission in September 2012 to advise on the need for, and the location of, future runways.

The Commission will decide in the autumn whether or not to shortlist an estuary option, before launching a  formal consultation on the final shortlisted options ahead of its final recommendations in summer 2015.
