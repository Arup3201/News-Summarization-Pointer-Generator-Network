Ali Carter has withdrawn from his planned comeback at a Players Tour Championship event in Bulgaria next month following advice from his doctor.

The two-times World Championship runner-up has been undergoing an intensive course of chemotherapy for lung cancer and although he said earlier this month that 'he was not out of the woods', he was keen to make his playing return at an event which runs from October 3-5.

But the 35-year-old, who had already beaten testicular cancer last year and suffers from Crohn's disease, has admitted he will be unable to play his first tournament since May on medical orders.

Ali Carter's doctor has advised him not to make his comeback in the Players Tour Championship, Bulgaria

'It is with great regret that I have had to withdraw from the upcoming European Tour event in Bulgaria,' he said in a statement on www.worldsnooker.com.

'I have been suffering with some complications following my last procedure and my consultant, Professor Neville Davidson, has advised me against playing right now, and to rest.'

Carter finished runner-up to Ronnie O'Sullivan (L) for the second time in the 2012 World Championships

Nevertheless, Carter is optimistic that he will soon be able to make his comeback.

'I am so disappointed to have to withdraw, but remain full of excitement about competing again,' he added.

'I remain positive and hopeful that I will be well enough to return to competition soon.'
