A couple were disgusted when they tucked into their roast chicken - only to discover it was green.

Adrian King, 44, had already eaten some of the meat he had bought from Morrisons when he noticed some of the poultry was a funny shade.

Mr King, from Preston, Lancashire, was so disgusted that he complained to the supermarket - which confirmed the green shade was bile from the gall bladder.

But Mr King was disgusted when he was given just £15 compensation from the supermarket chain.

He said: 'My wife and I had already eaten some by the time we noticed it was green on the inside. I began to feel a bit nauseous because of the thought.

'I sent it off and after two weeks of worrying I'd heard nothing, so I had to start chasing for answers

'After letters and emails back and forth, they eventually admitted liability and said the colour was bile from the gall bladder which hadn't been removed correctly.

'They sent £15 in compensation, which I returned as an insult.

'I'm not bothered about the money, it's the company's response and customer service that I've found unacceptable; after all, we were sold a bird unfit for human consumption.'

A Morrisons spokesman insisted the compensation was adequate.

In a statement, they said: 'We take our commitments to customer service extremely seriously and the quality of our products is always of paramount importance.'
