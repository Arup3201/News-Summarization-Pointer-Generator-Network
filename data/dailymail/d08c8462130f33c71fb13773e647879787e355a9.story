The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday that Christian firms can challenge an Obamacare mandate that forces employers to offer their staff free contraception as part of their health insurance. 

Hobby Lobby, a crafting supply store owned by a family that also runs a chain of Christian bookstores, sued the federal government over Obamacare's requirement that every health insurance policy include coverage for the morning-after pill and intra-uterine contraceptive devices, without requiring pharmacy co-payments from consumers.

Now about 40 similar plaintiffs are involved, arguing that since their religious beliefs hold that human life begins at conception, they can't be forced to provide birth-control that prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman's uterus.

Hobby Lobby owners David and Barbara Green say they want to operate their business according to their Christian faith. That includes not providing employees with forms of contraception that they believe ends human life

The Hobby Lobby case won't revisit the legality of abortion, guaranteed in the Roe v. Wade court decision, but it will likely determine whether a private company has to provide health insurance that includes drugs some groups see as 'abortion pills'

The Green family closes all its Hobby Lobby stores on Sundays in observance of their Christian faith, but they say the Affordable Care Act prohibits them from exercising other facts of their religious freedom

Hobby Lobby employs 13,000 people. Its owners do not object to condoms, diaphragms and other  forms of contraception. But they face fines of up to $1.3 million per day if they don't provide their workers with a health insurance plan that complies with the Affordable Care Act, beginning with the first day of a new insurance plan year.

They have avoided paying the fine so far by shifting their group plan's renewal date.

Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp, another named plaintiff, objects mainly to the 'Plan B' contraceptive pill and other similar medications. The company is owned by a Mennonite family.

Autocam Corp., a Michigan company that makes auto parts and medical equipment, objects to the law because its owners are Roman Catholic and oppose all forms of birth control.

In dueling press releases, the Obama administration and conservative activists sparred over the arguments that the high court will likely hear in March.

Susan B. Anthony's List, an anti-abortion group, focused on what it called the administration's 'abortion-drug mandate.'

The group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement that '[w]e applaud the Supreme Court for taking up this case addressing our fundamental freedom of religion and conscience, During the debate over the Affordable Care Act, Americans were assured that these rights would be honored, but as Obamacare is rolled out, we see this is simply not the case.'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday in a statement that '[w]e believe this requirement is lawful and essential to womenâ€™s health, and are confident the Supreme Court will agree,' referring to the inclusion of contraceptives among the Affordable Care Act's 'ten essential services.'

'The Administration has already acted to ensure no church or similar religious institution will be forced to provide contraception coverage and has made a commonsense accommodation for non-profit religious organizations that object to contraception on religious grounds,' Carney said.

Not an issue? Condoms and other forms of birth control aren't part of Hobby Lobby's objection, but one Catholic plaintiff has a problem with being required to provide employees with any form of birth control

But the issue before the Supreme Court is whether private businesses, not churches and their related charities, can operate in a way that reflects their faith.

Hobby Lobby already shutters its stores on Sundays and closes at 8:00 p.m. each night so its employees can be at home when their children go to bed.

In a video produced in 2012 by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Hobby Lobby co-founder Barbara Green said her family's religious faith is 'a part of our life that is â€“ we can't separate it from our work.'

David Green, her husband and the company's CEO, added that 'my convictions enter into how we run our business.'

He said Tuesday in a statement that his legal challenge 'has always remained 
about one thing and one thing only: the right of our family businesses 
to live out our sincere and deeply held religious convictions as 
guaranteed by the law and the Constitution.'

'Business owners should not 
have to choose between violating their faith and violating the law.'

In 1993 Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, limiting the federal government's ability to enforce laws that constitute a religious burden to Americans.

Last year the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that corporations can be equally protected by that law, writing that 'the contraceptive-coverage requirement substantially burdens Hobby Lobby.'

The U.S. Supreme Court said it will decide whether religious freedoms trump the Obama administration's desire to make sure all Americans have access to free birth control, regardless of where they work

The Obama administration has already carved out exceptions to the law for churches and their charities, like this hospital, but no such help is available to private businesses owned by the Christian faithful

The Obama administration argues that letting that ruling stand would remove health protections from citizens who happen to work for companies run by the religiously observant.

In addition to deciding whether or not 'corporate persons' can assert the 1993 law's protections when they clash with other federal laws, the case could produce the Supreme Court's first abortion-related decision since 2007 when it upheld the federal Partial Birth Abortion Act.

Different medical authorities disagree on the definition of a pregnancy. Some, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, argue that pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg is implanted in the womb.

The Catholic Medical Association and other like-minded organizations, however, say life begins at conception. 'Emergency contraception,' they claim, can kill a living human being.
