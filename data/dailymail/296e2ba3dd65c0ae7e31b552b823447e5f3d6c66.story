Nottingham Forest have completed the loan signing of Hull midfielder Tom Ince.

Reds boss Stuart Pearce was in talks with the  Premier League club for several days and on Thursday morning an agreement was reached for the 22-year-old winger to move to the City Ground on a deal until December 28.

Pearce is keen to breathe new life into his side's promotion push, following a seven-match winless run in the  Championship, and Ince will go straight into the Forest squad for Saturday's trip to Huddersfield.

Pearce managed Ince at England Under 21 level and knows the midfielder well 

Ince, who Pearce knows well from his time as England Under 21 manager, joined Hull from Blackpool in the summer but has found first-team opportunities limited at the KC Stadium and has not been involved in Steve Bruce's squad for the past month.

Ince is a proven quality at Championship level, having scored 18 goals for Blackpool during the 2012/13 season - a campaign which saw him named the Football League Young Player of the Year. 

Forest haven't won a game in over a month, falling off the pace in the Championship after a good start

Ince has played just four times since his summer transfer and is yet to score a Premier League goal for Hull
