A compound belonging the leader of one of America's largest polygamous sects is to be sold at auction.

Warren Jeffs's 6.1 acre property in Hildale could fetch up to $2.65million when it goes up for sale on April 25.

Jeffs, who is still thought to lead the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), is in prison in Texas, having been jailed for life after convictions for child sex abuse and bigamy.

The sale has been instigated to raise money for a legal settlement involving the FLDS.

Willie Jessop, a former spokesman of the FLDS sued a group of the sect's leaders, including Jeffs and his brother Lyle Jeffs, and was eventually awarded a $30million default judgement.

Mr Jessop alleged that the FLDS members broke into his business premises, stealing a range of property including computers and hard drives.

He also claimed to have been blackmailed, said he had been excommunicated and claimed that he had been forced to lie for Warren Jeffs.

When the sect leaders failed to respond, a fifth district judge awarded the default settlement, with the auction contributing to the sum.

Jessop, who was once a staunch defender of Jeffs, left after the church after the child sex abuse allegations against the sect's leader surfaced.

Mr Jessop could make a bid for the property himself, according to his attorney Mark James, who siad that could use part of the legal settlement to bid for it.

The property, which will be auctioned on the steps of the Washington County Courthouse in St. George, was built in 2010 and 2011 in polygamous Utah town twinned with Colorado City, Arizona.

It is believed to have been built while Jeffs was awaiting trial, with his wives and family apparently moving in after his release from custody.

The property is surrounded by 12ft walls, with three brick properties visible inside. It is located next to a number of FLDS buildings, including the FLDS clinic.

A 1,700-acre centre, owned by the church, the
Yearning for Zion Ranch, was pictured last year after most of its 700 residents had fled.

According to local tax records, the total value of the land is appraised at more than $33 million.

Prosecutors have also alleged that FLDS leaders financed the 
property through money laundering. The sect bought the land for about 
$1.1 million in 2003, according to an affidavit.

Texan authorities wanted to seize ownership of the ranch where prosecutors say the convicted polygamist sect leader
and his followers sexually assaulted dozens of children.

Arizona's attorney general Tom Horne last month announced a criminal probe of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office, which serves as a small police force in the twin polygamous towns Hildale and Colorado City.

During
a news conference held in Phoenix, Mr Horne also announced that a 
26-year-old woman had been granted temporary custody of her six children
and had fled the town of Colorado City, the home base of the FLDS.

He said she was forced by by its jailed leader Warren Jeffs to
marry her brother-in-law at the age of 14, and had since been virtually
held captive in the town on the Utah-Arizona border, along with many 
other women who want to leave.

'What they do is say, "Everybody watch her so she won't run away". Then she can't leave,' Horne said.

'Women who wanted to escape have been forcibly held by the marshals against their will.'

Attorneys for the two towns and the Marshal's Office adamantly denied the charges, calling Horne's words 'inflammatory'.

'I
can't speak for the FLDS but the bottom line is the Marshal's Office 
absolutely does not hold people against their will,' said lawyer Blake 
Hamilton.

Warren Jeffs gave specific instructions on his bed, saying that it should be padded and long enough to hold him and there should be a plastic cover on the mattress to 'protect from what will happen'

'The Arizona
attorney general, as the highest ranking law enforcement official in 
Arizona, ought not be making those statements unless he has evidence of 
it.

'It's just absolutely not true,' Hamilton said.

The church does not have a spokesperson to speak on its behalf.

Horne
fought last year for a bill in the Arizona Legislature aimed at 
abolishing the Marshal's Office in Colorado City, and replacing law 
enforcement there with deputies from the Mohave County Sheriff's Office.

It
failed to pass, so he allocated funds to provide for limited patrols by
deputies but says the money will soon run out, and he is again asking 
the Legislature to take up the bill.

Horne was joined at the press 
conference by Flora Jessop, a vocal critic of the FLDS who fled the 
church in 1986. She was flanked by her sister, Ruby Jessop, and the 
woman's six young children.

Flora
Jessop said her sister, who did not speak Tuesday, had been held 
captive by the FLDS for years, undergoing sexual and mental abuse at the
hands of her husband while not being allowed to leave with her kids.

Ruby
Jessop finally fled last year, and recently won temporary custody of 
her children who were being held 'hostage' by the sect, Flora Jessop 
said.

'It's a good day for freedom,' she said.

The FLDS Church teaches that a man having multiple wives is ordained by God and is a requirement for a man to receive the highest form of salvation.

It is generally believed in the church that a man should have a minimum of three wives to fulfill this requirement.

Wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands.

The church has come under fire over allegations of sexual and mental abuse of wives and underage polygamous marriages.

There are said to be over 30,000 people practising polygamy in Utah, Idaho, Montana and Arizona, even though it is illegal.

Mohave
County Sheriff Tom Sheahan said his agency also is involved in a 
criminal investigation of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office.

He described authorities there as 'security guards for the FLDS church.'.

'They are corrupt and work only for the FLDS and Warren Jeffs,' Sheahan said.

He said it's a dangerous situation 
for his deputies to be patrolling Colorado City without the cooperation 
of local law enforcement from the Marshal's Office.

'They are not our allies,' Sheahan said. 'I wouldn't trust them as backup for our deputies.'

Another attorney who represents Colorado City called the allegations outlandish, and said the Marshal's Office works well with Mohave County deputies.

'The Marshal's Office welcomes the presence of the sheriff's deputies because it provides them with backup,' said lawyer Jeff Matura. 'The more police service, the better protection for everyone.'

Last year, the U.S. Justice Department sued Colorado City and Hildale, claiming discrimination against residents who are not FLDS members. Arizona also has a similar ongoing civil lawsuit against Colorado City.

The criminal probe announced Tuesday by Horne and Sheahan mirrors the one that landed Jeffs in prison.

After receiving a complaint of child abuse, Texas authorities in 2008 raided the FLDS' Yearning for Zion Ranch. The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history.

All of the children were eventually returned but 11 men - including Jeffs and other high-ranking FLDS lieutenants - were arrested on charges of sexual assault or bigamy and later convicted.
