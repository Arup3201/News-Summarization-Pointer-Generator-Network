It is a far cry from the eco-conscious hybrids we are used to seeing on the roads.

Lamborghini today launched the Asterion, which boasts both traditional and electric motors.

The firm says this allows the car to 282 travel miles per gallon - yet still hit 200mph.

The Lamborghini Asterion, which was revealed at the Paris Auto show. It has a 5.2-liter V10 that creates 610 horsepower, along with 300 horsepower worth of electric propulsion.

The Asterion has a  5.2-liter V10 that creates 610 horsepower, along with 300 horsepower worth of electric propulsion.

Together they produce 910 horsepower, sent to all four wheels.

On the electric engine alone, it can reach up to 125 kilometers an hour for 32 miles.

With the V10, it has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).

It can accelerate from 0-100 km/h  in just 3 seconds.

Based on a monocoque made entirely of carbon fibre .

Two different driving modes: in hybrid mode it is combining the V10 engine with the three electric. 

In pure electric drive mode only the two electric motors in the front are used.

Called the Lamborghini Asterion LPI 910-4, it has a  5.2-liter V10 that creates 610 horsepower, along with 300 horsepower worth of electric propulsion.

Together they produce 910 horsepower, sent to all four wheels.

On the electric engine alone, it can reach up to 125 kilometers an hour for 32 miles.

The Asterion, described as a 'technology demonstrator,' has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).

The firm say the car is 'defines a solution to significantly reducing CO2 emissions through technologies available today, guaranteeing the unique Lamborghini driving feel with a smooth and reactive driveability and with superior power, including an exceptional pure electric range of 50 km.'

They say the car is a technology demonstrator representing a Lamborghini model that could be realistically produced today, using technologies currently available and drawing on Lamborghini's own expertise.

'Lamborghini is always looking ahead, investing in new technologies and setting new benchmarks, delivering the unexpected,' says Stephan Winkelmann, President and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini.

'Lamborghini continues to focus on weight reduction as a means to reducing CO2, for example through the investment in carbon fiber engineering, which also contributes to our quest for the best super sports car handling and performance.

'To significantly reduce emissions on a car in this moment however, plug-in electrification is the best option for us, because for Lamborghini such a car must still provide a truly emotional driving experience. 

'In the Asterion this is guaranteed through a naturally aspirated engine that is combined with PHEV technology, which not only offers exceptionally low CO2 emissions of 98 g/km, but a practical pure electric driving range of 50 km.

'The Asterion LPI 910-4 is a true Lamborghini: emotional, with a stunning design, powerful, yet conceived more for comfortable luxury daily cruising than for ultimate track performance.'

The lithium battery is placed longways in the central tunnel area, normally reserved for the transmission.

This allows for better balance of the car and also protects the battery area in case of lateral crash impact.

The Asterion has two different driving modes: in hybrid mode it is combining the V10 engine with the three electric motors guaranteeing a permanent four-wheel drive without being dependent on the battery's state of charge. 

The firm says 'The Asterion, like all Lamborghini cars, has clearly defined lines, separating flat planes from the side of the car and distinguishing between panels'

 The Astwerion is among a range of cars revealed at the show.

One of the showcase cars is the aptly named Bentley Mulsanne Speed, unashamedly billed as 'the world's fastest ultra-luxury driving experience.'

The Mulsanne name is lifted directly from Bentley's roots in motorsport: Before it was acquired in 1931 by Rolls-Royce, Bentley won five of seven races from 1924 through 1930 at the fabled Le Mans endurance circuit in France, where racecars reach peak velocity on the track's Mulsanne Straight.

Owned since 1998 by Germany's Volkswagen, Bentley has been slowly rebuilding its image as a purveyor of fast cars. 

The new Mulsanne Speed, expected to retail for upwards of 250,000 euros ($320,000), boasts a massive twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produces 395 kilowatts (530 horsepower), enabling a top speed of 305 kilometres per hour (190 miles per hour).

In the same stratosphere is Ferrari's 458 Speciale A, a limited-edition two-seater based on the Italian automaker's 458 Spider.

Although pricing hasn't been officially announced -- a 220,000 euro ($280,000) sticker has been mooted -- word in Italy is that all 499 copies have been reserved by prospective buyers.

Fitted with a 450 kW (605 hp) V8 engine, the Speciale is said to reach a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).

Compared with the Ferrari and the Bentley, Germany's Daimler appears to have more modest aspirations for its new Mercedes-AMG GT, a new sports car that arrives next year, priced from around 95,000 euros ($120,000).

The twin-turbo two-seater will be offered in two versions, a 340 kW (462 hp) GT and a 375 kW (510 hp) GT S. 

Top speed is projected to be 310 km/h (193 mph), which makes it look like something of a bargain next to its rivals.
