The United States considered moving its Benghazi consulate a mile away to a CIA base a month before the deadly attack by militants linked to al-Qaeda which killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three.

A classified cable also reveals the U.S. mission drafted a contingency plan to suspend its operation as security in the Libyan city deteriorated amid increasing violence.

The secret cable, sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's office, reflected officials' concerns that the Libyan militia protecting the consulate could have been infiltrated by extremists.

The message, seen by Fox News, reported the discussions from an August 15 emergency meeting, including the detail that members of the Libyan February 17 Brigade were hesitant to share information with the Americans.

Burning issue: Mr Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the US Mission in Benghazi on September 11, for which Al Qaeda in North Africa and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia were implicated

Consulate staff believed they were 
under surveillance in the early hours of September 11 when a member of 
the police unit guarding the compound was found taken photographs of the
inside of the mission, according to documents recovered from the site 
by Foreign Policy magazine.

Days after the attack, an 
intelligence source told Fox News: 'One thing for sure is that the 17 
Brigade was nowhere to be found and the Americans were left on their own
in the assault.'

Moving the consulate to the CIA annex might not have saved the four Americans who died in the September 11 strike.

Two of the four dead were killed at the site when it came under fire in the six-hour, commando-style attack on the U.S. Mission in the 
Libyan city, for which al-Qaeda and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia have been blamed.

The uncovering of the cable's contents come a day after intelligent chiefs admitted the CIA was operating a covert 
mission in the U.S. consulate in Libya when it came under attack.

The CIA made the revelation as it 
laid bare the heroic rescue by a handful of its agents in which they 
fought off wave after wave of mortar and rocket attacks with just their handguns as they sought to infiltrate the compound and shepherd its American staff to safety.

A timeline, released by the agency, has blown open the dramatic sequence of events, revealing for the first time that of the 30 American 
officials evacuated from the country following the deadly attack, just seven worked 
for the State Department.

The rest were part of a crack team of
intelligence and security experts on a secret mission aimed at 
counterterrorism and securing heavy weapons held by the embattled 
regime.

They had been operating out of a building known as 'the annex', around a mile away from the consulate in central Benghazi.

Intelligence officials told how when the annex received a call about the assault, about a half dozen members of a CIA 
security team tried to get heavy weapons and other assistance from the 
Libyans.

But with time running out, the team went ahead with the rescue attempt armed only with their standard-issue small arms.

A fierce firefight ensued and the team managed to get into the consulate and shepherd its occupants back to the annex under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades.

'The security officers in particular were 
genuine heroes,' an official said. 'They quickly tried to rally additional local support and
heavier weapons, and when that could not be accomplished within 
minutes, they still moved in and put their own lives on the line to save
their comrades.

'At
every level in the chain of command, from the senior officers in Libya 
to the most senior officials in Washington, everyone was fully engaged 
in trying to provide whatever help they could.'

The CIA revelations come after Barack Obama's administration came under sharp attack over its handling of the incident amid claims Washington told officers on the ground to 'stand down' before the rescue took place.

'There
was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground, by 
people at every U.S. organization that could play a role in assisting 
those in danger,' the official added. 'There were no orders to anybody to stand down in 
providing support.'

In the first days after the attack, various administration officials 
linked the Benghazi incident to the simultaneous protests around the 
Muslim world over an American-made film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet 
Muhammad.

Only later did they publicly attribute it to militants, 
possibly linked to al-Qaeda, and acknowledged it was distinct from the 
film protests.

The changing explanations have led to suspicions that the
administration didn't want to acknowledge a terror attack on U.S. 
personnel so close to the November 6 election, a charge President Obama has strongly 
denied.

Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior

Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours

According to the timeline, around 9.40pm Benghazi time, officials at the CIA's relatively fortified and well-defended base in Benghazi got a call from State Department officials at the U.S. diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less-fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants.

Other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel.

9.40pm - CIA officials in 'The Annex' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack.

10.05pm - Armed only with handguns, team of about six CIA security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound.

10.30pm - With bullets whistling overhead, the CIA team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local Libyan allies.

11.10pm - A Defense Department drone, which had 
been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to 
help officials on the ground gather information.

11.30pm - U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for, except for Ambassador Stevens.

11.40pm - Driving back to the secure base, the evacuees come under further fire.

12am - The installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.

12am - A CIA security team 
based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, lands at 
Benghazi airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador.

1am - The patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting.

4am - The 
reinforcements from Tripoli take a convoy of 
vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for evacuation.

4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base, killing two U.S. security officers.

5.30 - A heavily armed Libyan military unit 
arrive at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel 
to the Benghazi airport.

From 6am - Roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of 
Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were 
loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said.

The dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organise a response to the attack.

About 25 minutes after the initial report came into the CIA base, a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound.

Over the succeeding 25 minutes, the CIA team approached the compound, and tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to get local Libyan allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons, and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound, the intelligence official said.

At around 11.10pm, a Defense Department drone, which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to help officials on the ground gather information.

By 11.30, U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for Ambassador Stevens, who was missing, the intelligence official said.

When they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the CIA base, however, the convoy carrying U.S. evacuees came under fire.

Once they got back to the CIA base, that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.

These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes, the intelligence official said.

Around the same time, a CIA security team 
based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at 
Benghazi airport. Upon its arrival, however, the team spent some time 
trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing 
Ambassador Stevens.

After some time
trying to solve these problems, the security team that had flown in 
from Tripoli eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra 
transportation, but decided not to go the hospital where they believed 
Stevens had been taken.

In part this was because they had reason to 
believe Stevens was likely dead, and because security at the hospital 
was believed, at best, to be 'uncertain,' the intelligence official 
said.

Not long before dawn, the 
reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of 
vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation.

However,
just after they arrived at the CIA base, the official said, a new round
of attacks on that facility was launched, this time with mortars. 
Although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes, two US security 
officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells, the 
intelligence official said.

Finally,
a bit less than an hour later, a heavily armed Libyan military unit 
arrived at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel 
to the Benghazi airport, the official added.

Over
the next few hours, roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of 
Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were 
loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said.
