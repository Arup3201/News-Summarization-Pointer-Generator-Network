Senior doctor Dr Steven Forde, 45, has been suspended for nine months for secretly filming a woman in a mini skirt in York city centre

A senior doctor and father-of-three who secretly filmed a miniskirt-wearing woman as a 'reward' after a hard day's work has been suspended for nine months. 

Dr Steven Forde, 45, used a camera hidden in an adapted satchel to take five minutes of covert footage as the woman walked through York city centre in May last year. 

He was acquitted of criminal charges after prosecutors offered no evidence - but a Fitness to Practise panel ruled his actions amounted to misconduct after hearing they were 'sexually motivated'.

But today, a panel decided to suspend the doctor for just nine months after he insisted he had cleaned up his act. 

Forde, a former RAF medic who once served in Bosnia and Kosovo, told the panel he has been undergoing treatment for the 'underlying issues' that cause his behaviour and said he had not indulged in any secret filming since his arrest.

The tribunal heard the York Hospital consultant used a concealed digital camera equipped with a telephoto lens, which he operated using a 'fire switch' hidden in a specially adapted bag.

During the police investigation Forde admitted he had filmed women before and said he had other images at home, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester heard.

But the married doctor, from Haxby, near York, was acquitted of outraging public decency after the CPS brought no evidence against him.

Police found other clandestine video recordings on his home computer, but no charges were brought, the panel heard.

During a trust investigation Forde admitted that this type of behaviour happened the 'majority of the time once or twice a week' and 'more in the summer months.'

Father-of-three Forde told the panel that on May 9, 2013 he had been working at York Hospital until midnight and was on call until 8am. 

He said: 'I took my camera off to some woodland a few miles away to take some photographs of the scenery.

'I was looking for forest scenery. I wanted spring flowers, that sort of scene.

'I then went into the city centre. I was going away with friends for the weekend who I was going to play hockey with.'

He then said he adapted his camera to record video of whatever it was pointing at. 

'I took footage of a woman walking down the pavement through the centre of town.

According to a security guard, this included the woman's 'legs, skirt and body'. He was then detained for voyeurism.

Last week he claimed the incident followed three 'stressful events' in his professional life, including a a formal complaint made against him by a patient who said he was 'rude and aggressive'.

He said he had to give evidence at the GMC after a medical student he was in charge of continued onto third year even though he hadn't been signed off.

In a third incident, he said he had to help transfer a three-week-old baby to Leeds hospital but the baby died.

He said: 'I found the experience one of the most stressful things I've ever done. Those legal practises - most of us are not used to this sort of environment. 

'It doesn't justify what I did, but in my mind the stresses inhibited me from dealing with the behaviour that was causing this.' 

Forde, who was supported by wife Beverley throughout the hearing, confessed to a ten-year 'compulsion' that led him to commit similar acts as a kind of 'reward' in times of stress. 

He was handed a formal warning and returned to work in March this year, though he is not allowed to examine female patients without a chaperone 'except in life-threatening situations'.

He was also prohibited from attending formal meetings with female trainee doctors unaccompanied in his role as Training Programme Director with York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
