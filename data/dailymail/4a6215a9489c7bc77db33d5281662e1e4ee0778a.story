A prison officer who sold information about James Bulger's
killer Jon Venables to The Sun has been jailed for 16 months, it can be reported for the first time today.

Richard Trunkfield,
31, from Moulton, Northamptonshire, admitted leaking information about the
child murderer while working at high security 
Woodhill prison near Milton Keynes.

Trunkfield told the paper Venables was being held in isolation and even about his eating habits, including the prisoner's love of burger and chips.

He made £3,350 by fuelling five stories, including prison rumours that the child murderer's family were refusing to visit him behind bars.

It
could not initially be reported that the inmate involved was Venables
because of legal restrictions on reporting his whereabouts.

But the court heard today that Venables is no longer at Woodhill so the crime was made public.

Jailed: Richard Trunkfield, a former prison officer at HMP Woodhill,  attempts to hide his face while arriving at the Old Bailey today, where he was jailed for selling details on killer Jon Venables

Details: The crime involving the sale of information on Jon Venables, shown aged 10, was kept secret as it revealed the jail he was in

Venables, now living under an assumed
identity, was convicted with Robert Thompson of killing toddler James 
Bulger in 1993 when they were both 10.

He was recalled to prison in 2010 after being suspected of child porn offences.

Trunkfield pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office between March 2 and April 30, 2010.

Tragedy: James Bulger was murdered in 1993 aged two years old by Venables and accomplice Robert Thompson

New father Trunkfield had contact with a journalist at The Sun between 10 and 15 times and received £3,500 for information.

He used it to pay off credit card debts, the court heard.

The 31-year-old had also cared for his mother while she was suffering from cancer in 2008 and 2009.

Jailing him the judge told him today: 'It's for those in authority to decide on the extent to which, if at all, it's in the public interest to reveal the details concerning a particular defendant, balancing a wide range of factors.

'It is most assuredly not for individual prison officers to take it upon themselves to contact the press to reveal information about a defendant in circumstances such as those before the court today, still less to enrich themselves in the process.'

In mitigation, the court heard that Trunkfield had no direct contact with Venables and passed on minor details such as what he was eating.

After he saw the stories that were being published, he assigned his journalist contact a different ringtone so he could ignore the calls, the court heard.

It was also claimed that information was being leaked by another, unidentified source at the prison.

He has also resigned his job and has nothing to do with the criminal.

Gone: Venables is no longer at Woodhill Prison near Milton Keynes so the prison officer's crime can be published

Meanwhile a former police officer has been jailed for 10 months today for selling details of the arrests of footballer John Terry's mother and Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood to The Sun newspaper.

Sold stories: Former Surrey PC Alan Tierney admitted two counts of misconduct in public office

Ex-Surrey Pc Alan Tierney was sentenced at the Old Bailey today after admitting two counts of misconduct in 
public office for telling the paper that the former England 
captain’s mother was held for shoplifting.

Tierney also revealed the arrest of guitarist Wood for beating up his girlfriend for cash.

Earlier this month he pleaded guilty to two counts - one between March 26 and April 3, 2009, and a second between December 2 and 7, 2009.

He leaked details about Sue Terry and Sue Poole, the mother and mother-in-law of former England football captain John Terry, being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting in Surrey.

He also sold details about the arrest of guitarist Ronnie Wood, 65, on suspicion of beating up his Russian lover Ekaterina Ivanova, who is in her 20s.

Terry, Poole and Wood all accepted cautions over the matters.

Passing sentence at the Old Bailey today, Mr Justice Fulford said that Tierney's offences were 'a disgraceful way for a police officer to act'.

The judge said: 'It is wholly against the public interest for those who hold public office cynically to profit out of the misery or unfortunate circumstances of those for whom they are responsible.'

The court heard that Tierney had sold the name and address of a witness to the Wood incident.Mr Justice Fulford said: “The most serious aspect of the two offences is that, in relation to count two, the defendant provided the name and, most significantly, the address of the witness.

'The fact that the individual coincidentally tried to sell the story to another newspaper is neither here nor there in terms of what this defendant had in mind.

'Put bluntly, it could easily have led to that witness withdrawing all co-operation as regards being a witness.'

The court heard that Tierney was one of the officers sent to deal with Terry and Poole when they were stopped by store detectives at a Tesco in Weybridge, Surrey.

After the Sun ran an exclusive story about the arrests, he contacted the tabloid from the email address guildford1@gmail.com, to correct the reported value of the goods involved, from £850 to £1,450.

He was then contacted by journalists on the newspaper, and was offered a “donation” for a detailed account of what the women said and what they were accused of taking.

Alan Tierney also sold information about the arrest of John Terry's mother and mother-in-law

Tierney also tipped them off when civil legal action was started for compensation.

He was paid with a cheque in his brother-in-law’s name.

In relation to the second count, he was called to interview a witness to the incident involving Wood.

Tierney contacted a journalist at the Sun, including making one of the calls while he was at a police station.

He gave the name and address of the witness to the newspaper.

In mitigation, the court heard that most of the details would have eventually become public, and that their leak had not undermined any investigation.

The witness in the Terry case had also approached two other newspapers to try to sell his story.

Defending, Bill Emlyn Jones said Tierney was 'an effective and well-regarded police officer' who was commended a number of times during his 11 years as a constable.

He said: 'He has lost everything already. He has been dismissed from the job that he loved and he has therefore lost his income, his reputation, his family. His wife has separated from him and contact with his children has been extremely difficult.

'His fall from grace is complete already.'

He said that Tierney was genuinely sorry and regretted what had happened.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
