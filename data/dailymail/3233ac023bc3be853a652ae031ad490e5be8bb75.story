Texts: The LMA described Malky Mackay's messages to Iain Moody as ‘friendly text message banter’

Sorry:  Mackay made a public apology on Friday followingSportsmail's exclusive revelations

Leroy Rosenior (former Torquay and Brentford manager, who also worked in Sierra Leone)

‘If the LMA are going back into the dark ages to support people then I might have to withdraw my support.

‘In over 70,000 text messages I’ve sent, I’ve never used inappropriate language and I’m sure neither have the vast majority of people.

‘I know they [LMA] are trying to protect their member, but in doing so I feel they are almost abusing another member, like myself.’

Troy Townsend - Education and development manager for Kick It Out, also father of Tottenham and England winger Andros

‘Does it (yesterday’s apology) undo the damage from Thursday? I don’t think it does. It is welcome but Thursday’s statement will stick in people’s minds.

‘I wish they (LMA) had taken a step back and said ‘‘this would have been more appropriate’’ in the first place.’ 

Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's story in Thursday's Daily Mail

Revelation: Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Moody's text message exchanges

Clarke Carlisle - Former PFA chairman

‘The initial statement was incredibly poorly worded but should not deflect from the real issue. It has to be reiterated there is no place for language or sentiment to prejudicial thinking in the game, and if Malky is found to have fallen foul of those standards he needs to face the consequences.

‘The FA has got to take a strong and efficient stance on this.’

Paul Mortimer - Kick It Out professional players’ engagement manager

‘I don’t think you’ll find victims accepting they have been the victims of ‘‘banter’’.’
