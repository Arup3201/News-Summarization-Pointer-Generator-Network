Mourning: Crowds in Kiev's Independence Square yesterday honour the 82 who were killed in anti-government protests

British involvement in a £19billion bailout of Ukraine would be ‘completely unacceptable’, MPs warned last night.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs that Ukraine’s fledgling revolution could collapse within weeks unless it receives billions in aid from the international community.

But Conservative and Labour MPs joined forces in the Commons to warn ministers that Britain should resist pouring huge sums into the troubled former Soviet state until it has tackled its endemic corruption problems.

It came after Ukraine appealed for urgent help to prevent its economy ‘heading into the abyss’.

Acting Ukrainian president Oleksandr Turchinov warned that Kiev could default on its debts unless it receives £19billion over the next two years.

But Mr Hague, who will hold crisis talks on the situation in Washington today, played down a suggestion from Chancellor George Osborne that  Britain would offer Ukraine’s revolutionaries a blank cheque.

Tory MP Bill Cash warned against getting sucked into a European Union backed bailout,  saying the potential cost to British taxpayers was ‘so horrendous as to be completely unacceptable’.

Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw said ‘rapacious and endemic corruption’ in Ukraine was now so widespread that aid should be withheld unless ‘very stringent’ conditions are met to ensure it is not misspent.

And Labour veteran Dennis Skinner said it was extraordinary that ministers were suggesting ‘taking money from the pockets of flood-ravaged and  austerity-ridden Britain to hand over to the EU fanatics in  the Ukraine’.

Poland also warned that any aid package for Ukraine would have to be very tightly monitored.

The country’s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, one of the EU’s mediators in the crisis, said: ‘As you know in Ukraine we have a long record of agreements that have not been honoured.’

Mr Hague, who held talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday, said initial aid was likely to come from the International Monetary Fund and would not involve a financial contribution from Britain.

He said: ‘What we are talking about is IMF support that does not involve any extra money being taken out of the pockets of anyone in the UK.’

Mr Hague said Ukraine was in dire need of aid after Russia indicated it would pull the plug on a £12billion bailout following the dramatic overthrow of former president Viktor Yanukovych at the weekend.  Mr Hague suggested some aid would be needed to prop up Ukraine before it holds elections in May.

‘Ukraine’s financial situation is very serious and without outside assistance may not be sustainable,’ he said.

‘An economic crisis in Ukraine would be a grave threat to the country’s stability and have damaging wider consequences.’ Mr Osborne suggested Britain would offer Ukraine a blank cheque at the weekend, saying: ‘We are here, ready to help, just as soon as  there is someone at the end of  the telephone.

‘We should be there with a chequebook to help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country.’

But Mr Hague yesterday insisted the international community would be cautious before handing over any money. He said demands would include an end to ‘pervasive corruption’, along with widespread economic reforms.

He added: ‘It requires a stable and legitimate government to be in place and a commitment to the reforms necessary to produce economic stability.

‘International financial support cannot be provided without conditions and clarity that it will be put to proper use.’

The IMF agreed a £10billion loan for Ukraine in 2010, but suspended the deal last year after Kiev failed to implement the required reforms, which included removing gas price subsidies and freely floating the currency.

The EU is also looking at a potential bailout, although this is likely to be forthcoming only if Ukraine first reaches a deal with the IMF.

‘Nothing can be ruled out,’ an EU official said. ‘Many of the proposals we’re working on require an IMF deal to be in place, which means an operational government in Ukraine, so it can’t happen until after the elections.

‘But the EU is in a good position to coordinate action if member states want to provide money. They have the resources and there is a willingness to help.’
