Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers attracted criticism for his decision to field a weakened team against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night.

With one eye on Saturday's Premier League clash with Chelsea, the Reds boss decided to take big names Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli out of his line-up in the Bernabeu.

The thrashing many predicted did not materialise as Real won 1-0 but we will have to wait until the weekend to see if Rodgers' gamble pays off.

Here are 10 other examples of managers who have decided to field weakened teams and whether or not it was worth the risk.

1. Alan Pardew - Newcastle, 2013

The Newcastle boss fielded a semi-reserve side for the return leg against Benfica in the Europa League quarter-final, trailing 3-1 from Lisbon.

Pardew at the time said he was targeting the Tyne-Wear derby at the weekend, resting Hatem Ben Arfa, Sylvain Marveaux and Shola Ameobi.

It didn't go to plan, losing 4-2 on aggregate to the Portuguese side and seeing Paolo Di Canio's famous knee slide at St James' as Sunderland ran out 3-0 winners. Pointless.

2. Mick McCarthy - Wolves, 2009

One of few clubs to receive a fine for using the full squad, McCarthy made 10 changes for a trip to Manchester United just three days after beating Tottenham at White Hart Lane.

They predictably lost 3-0 at Old Trafford, but recalled nine players for the next game, a win over Burnley. Wolves took the £25,000 fine on the chin and avoided relegation. Job done.

3. Martin O'Neill - Aston Villa, 2009

Level at 1-1 from the first leg at Villa Park, O'Neill put out the likes of Marc Albrighton, Mustafa Salifou and Nathan Delfouneso for the trip to CSKA Moscow.

Villa lost 2-0 and the 2,000 fans that made the long, cold trip were rightly miffed. O'Neill put on a dinner for the travelling support to apologise for the decision, but Villa's season crumbled. They failed to win in their next eight games, finishing sixth having held a healthy lead over Arsenal in fourth.

4. George Graham - Arsenal, 1993

Spurs finished above Arsenal just over two decades ago after Graham played a weakened side four days before the FA Cup Final against Sheffield Wednesday.

Tottenham have only finished above their rivals once since, and having lost 3-1 on the day at Highbury, Graham made 11 changes for the Wembley showdown.

Arsenal went on to lift the FA Cup despite needing a replay against the Owls.

5. Ian Holloway - Blackpool, 2010

In their first season in the Premier League, Blackpool boss Holloway made 10 changes to the side that drew with Everton for the trip to Aston Villa.

His decision was almost vindicated, losing 3-2 to a last-minute James Collins goal before picking up 11 points from their next possible 15.

Blackpool were fined £25,000 to the dismay out the outspoken Holloway, who told reporters he would be handing in his resignation. He didn't, and Blackpool ended up relegated.

6. Gary Megson - Bolton, 2008

Gary Megson was heavily criticised by Bolton fans after deciding to field a second-string team in a 2008 UEFA Cup last 16 tie with Sporting Lisbon.

With one eye on a Premier League relegation showdown with Wigan the following Sunday, Megson omitted an entire XI from the party that travelled to Portugal.

The gamble back-fired spectacularly for Megson, whose side not only lost 1-0 to Sporting but were then beaten by the same scoreline by a Wigan side reduced to 10 men after just four minutes.

It took until the penultimate weekend of the season for Bolton to secure their top-flight status and they have not played in Europe since.

The decision was not a popular one with the Bolton fans, who called for Megson to be sacked

7. Garry Monk - Swansea, 2014

Monk chose to concentrate on a forthcoming Europa League round of 32 tie with Napoli when he made eight changes to the team he sent out in the FA Cup at Everton six days before.

Swansea played fairly well at Goodison Park but lost the fifth round tie 3-1 and were unable to beat Napoli too despite a first-choice team.

The first leg at the Liberty Stadium ended goalless before the Italian side prevailed 3-1 in Naples a week later.

8. George Allison - Arsenal, 1936

Fielding under-strength sides is not necessarily a modern phenomenon. Arsenal were fined £250 way back in 1936 when manager George Allison fielded under-strength sides in a succession of league matches.

The Gunners had beaten Barnsley to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup and had a favourable draw against Grimsby Town.

They were only seventh in the league standings and so Allison drafted in half-a-dozen players who'd never played for the club to turn out in the dead rubber league fixtures and protect his star names.

Despite the fine, Arsenal went on to win the Cup, beating Sheffield United 1-0 with their first choice XI.

9. Rafael Benitez - Liverpool, 2007

With a Champions League final against AC Milan on the horizon, Rafael Benitez made nine changes for Liverpool's penultimate Premier League game of the 2006-2007 season at Fulham.

The London side duly won the match 1-0, thanks to a Clint Dempsey goal, and recorded their first victory in 11 league matches.

Fulham duly stayed up but Neil Warnock, whose Sheffield United side suffered relegation as a consequence of Benitez's squad rotation, was left fuming.

10. Jose Mourinho - Chelsea, 2014

Even though his side still had a chance of winning the Premier League title last season, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho decided to prioritise the Champions League and put out a weakened side in a top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool.

It proved a masterstroke, as goals from Demba Ba and Willian secured victory at Anfield, denting Liverpool's title ambitions and ultimately allowing Manchester City through to claim the trophy.

But Mourinho didn't feel the benefit in the Champions League a few days later as Atletico Madrid won 3-1 at Stamford Bridge to reach the final.
