A two-year-old girl died when a fireplace fell on top of her after she tried to swing on the mantelpiece, an inquest has heard.

Trinity Liliana Coward, was playing in the living room of the family home in Lakenham in Norwich when she stood on the fireplace and grabbed the mantelpiece, which came away from the wall.

The heavy surround landed on top of the toddler and caused fatal head injuries earlier this month.

Her distraught mother, Kelly, 31, and father, Shaun, 35, rushed their daughter to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital but doctors were unable to save her.

Today senior coroner Jacqueline Lake told Norfolk Coroner's Court: 'She stood on the fireplace and reached up to hold on to the mantelpiece.

'Trinity then tried to swing while holding on to the mantelpiece.

'The mantelpiece suddenly came away from the wall, falling on the floor. Trinity's father picked her up but she was unresponsive.

'The ambulance service were immediately called and attended the scene and Trinity was transferred from her home to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

'Attempts were made at resuscitation but Trinity died soon after admission.'

She added: 'I understand the police have attended and conducted an investigation and found no evidence of third party involvement or suspicious circumstances.'

The inquest heard that a post mortem examination found that the toddler died from a 'complex head injury due to a blunt force trauma'.

After Trinity died, Mr and Mrs Coward paid tribute to their daughter, describing her as their 'little princess'.
