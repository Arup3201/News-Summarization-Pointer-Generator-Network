A socialite's predominately pink mansion bought after she split from her tycoon husband following her 11-year affair with a plastic surgeon is on the market for £8.2million.

Amanda Eliasch purchased the Cheyne Walk property from the 8th Earl of Cadogan in 2010 after she received a substantial chunk of her husband Johan's £400million fortune in her divorce settlement.

Her Grade
 II-listed mansion was built in 
the 1760s in Chelsea, but its history goes back to the Tudor-era where 
Henry VIII constructed a grand manor house for his sixth wife Catherine 
Parr in 1536.

Inside the mansion, with views over the

design scheme that skillfully mixes contemporary pieces with the classic

selling it.

Spread over five floors, the luxury home that for many years served as the London home of the Viscounts of Chelsea, has five bedrooms, three reception rooms, study and front entrance hall. It also has a 58ft private rear garden and front garden.

A grand-daughter of the St Trinian’s film director Sidney Gilliat, Amanda Eliasch trained as an actress at Rada and has forged a recent career as a photographer.

She caused controversy in 2001 when she staged an exhibition of her art called Peep, which featured explicit photographs of naked women. Residents close to the London gallery complained that children were viewing the images on the way to school.

Her marriage ended after her ex-husband Johan, CEO and chairman of sports firm Head, revealed that he had received an anonymous letter detailing her intimate relationship with Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, the French plastic surgeon and Botox specialist, who numbers Madonna and Elle Macpherson among his famous clients.

Cheyne Walk is a historic street in Chelsea. It was named after politician William Lord Cheyne - who owned the royal residence the manor of Chelsea - until 1712. Most of the houses were built in the 18th century.

It has had numerous famous residents - including:

Keith Richards who lived at number 3.Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull lived at number 48.American born artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, famous for his painting Whistler's Mother lived at numerous locations along the street. Suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst lived at number 120 after leaving university.American writer Henry James spent his last years at number 21.Actor and director Laurence Olivier and his then wife Jill Esmond lived there in the 1930s.George Best also lived along the exclusive street.

Mr Eliasch, a close friend of Prince 
Andrew and once an environmental adviser to Gordon Brown, said they were
 being blackmailed and suggested Amanda do nothing about ending their 
marriage.

But the love triangle soon made headlines, after a business 
associate of Dr Sebagh allegedly sold the story to a national newspaper.
 They divorced in 2007.

Eliasch
 has now asked Gary Hersham, the star of new BBC series 'Under Offer', 
to sell the house for £8.2 million through his agency, Beauchamp 
Estates.

The house will 
feature in the next episode, with Hersham describing the property as 
'glamorous, spacious and in a triple A location'.

He said: 'This is one of the finest houses on the Chelsea embankment.

'With its outstanding Chelsea address and superb location overlooking the River Thames, the site has an illustrious history.

'It
 has been a home to nobility dating back to King Henry VIII and has now 
been modernised to provide a super-luxurious residence ideal for 21st 
century living.

'It is one 
of the finest Thameside homes in Chelsea and is perfect for someone 
wanting to buy a trophy house of immense quality, provenance and luxury.

'In the show you see the triple AAA location, the glamorous interiors and the spacious rooms.

'What
 you don't get to learn about is the history dating back to King Henry 
VIII, its role as a home for nobility, and the Tudor vaults in the 
basement.

'All these things combine to make it an exceptional luxury residence and one of the finest homes in Chelsea.'

The original manor on the site had 17 principal bedroom suites, 20 reception rooms, a vast entrance hall and a large garden and orchard.

Sleek: It features a modern, white long kitchen leading on to a sitting room and garden

Magical: The garden's plants and greenery can be traced back to Henry VIII's original gardens and Royal orchard on the site

It later served as the home of the Dukes of Hamilton until in 1742 it became the home of Sir Hans Sloane and housed his magnificent art collection, which afterwards formed the nucleus of the British Museum.

However, it was demolished in 1748 and, between 1758 and 1765, the Cheyne Walk property was built along with its neighbours.

The rear gardens of these houses are all that remains of the lush greenery which can be traced back to Henry VIII's original gardens and Royal orchard.

Incredibly, the brick vaults on the lower ground floor are the remains of the original Tudor wine and ale vaults of King Henry VIII's Manor House.

Exclusive: The house sits overlooking the River Thames in West London, and the magnificent Albert Bridge

Royal: This is the manor built by Henry VIII for his sixth wife Catherine Parr, which was later demolished in the 18th century
