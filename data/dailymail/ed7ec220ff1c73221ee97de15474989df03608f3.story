Few honeymooners could hope for such a magical moment.

But one photographer celebrating his wedding was lucky enough to witness a stretch of beach lit up by bioluminescent phytoplankton.

Will Ho stumbled upon the awe-inspiring sight on a windy night in the Maldives.

Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism.

It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton.

The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light.

Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction.

Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways.

Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat.

Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators.

Millipedes also glow to put predators off of eating them.

The Taiwanese photographer saw tiny organisms, which glow like fireflies, riding waves and being washed up on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the shallow water.

The minute creatures are thought to emit light when they are stressed and as Mr Ho said the evening was a windy one, it is likely the organisms were agitated by crashing waves.

He took a couple of photos of glowing footsteps, which are caused as the organisms can be present in wet beach and get stressed when they are trodden on, making it possible for a person to see an illuminated path of where they have walked.

While bioluminescent phytoplankton has 
been known about for some time, it is only recently that biologists have
 worked out what causes them to glow.

on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the shallow water. The bioluminescent phytoplankton can survive in the sand and glow if they are trodden on, so that footsteps are illuminated (pictured right)

Marine Biologist Jorge Ribas told Discovery News the water is filled with bioluminescent phytoplankton called Lingulodinium polyedrum.

The microorganisms glow when stressed and reasons for their agitation include strong waves, a kayaker’s paddle splashing the water or a surfer carving up the water.

Mr Ho said: 'It was lucky for me to see such beautiful scenery and I took several pictures as great memories, but it's sad to see the garbage on the beach (centre) when I zoomed in the picture in my laptop.' He took the photos on a beach in the Maldives near a Thai restaurant that can be seen lit up in the background

‘It was lucky for me to see such beautiful scenery and I took several pictures as great memories, but it's sad to see the garbage on the beach when I zoomed in the picture in my laptop,’ Mr Ho wrote on his Flickr page.

The glowing beach phenomenon has been spotted around San Diego, California on a fairly regular basis since 1901, but there, the water appears slightly red because of an algal bloom, known as a red tide.

Mr Ho took photos of glowing footsteps and glowing clusters of the plankton on the beach (pictured), which are caused as the organisms can be present in wet sand and get stressed when they are trodden on, making it possible for a person to see an illuminated path of where they have walked
