A pensioner has gone on trial accused of murdering two teenagers 37 years ago.

Angus Sinclair, 69, is accused of raping and killing Christine Eadie and Helen Scott, both 17, after they left the World’s End pub in Edinburgh.

The murders are alleged to have been committed some time after October 15, 1977, when the teenagers were last seen leaving the bar on the capital’s Royal Mile at closing time.

Harrowing pictures of the two women’s bound and badly beaten bodies were shown to the jury at the High Court in Livingston yesterday.

The court was told the friends were gagged, tied up, raped and strangled with items of their own clothing.

Their bodies were found six miles apart on the morning of October 16, 1977, in East Lothian. Miss Eadie’s body was found in an area of ground near the foreshore at Gosford Bay while Miss Scott’s was discovered in a farmer’s field near Haddington.

Sinclair is alleged to have killed the teenagers while acting along with his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton, who is now dead.

Yesterday, only days short of the anniversary of the murders, jurors viewed distressing images of the bodies and were taken through details of their injuries.

Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, QC, prosecuting, suggested family members might wish to leave before the images were presented to the court.

But trial judge Lord Matthews said that it would not be fair to ask relatives of the two girls to leave if they wished to hear the evidence, and they agreed that the images would be shown to the jury but not put up on video screens on either side of the court visible to the public.

The Lord Advocate warned jurors the images would be ‘upsetting and disturbing’ and many among the nine women and six men were clearly moved.

The first day was taken up entirely with photographic evidence, the jury viewing the upsetting images of the bodies and the ligatures allegedly used to strangle them.

One showed a ligature made from a denim-style belt and a pair of reddish tights, which was found around the neck of Miss Scott. A pink bra shown in another image had been used as a ligature around the neck of Miss Eadie.

A former police photographer, Alastair Calderwood, 48, was shown a piece of paper recovered from the right hand pocket of Miss Scott’s coat.

He agreed with Mr Mulholland that it seemed to be a shopping list. The Lord Advocate said: ‘The writing appears to be a list of messages, or foodstuffs, to get from the grocers. An orange, two sausage rolls, milk…’

‘Yes,’ said Mr Calderwood.

The trial was also shown photographs of a white Morris Marina with the registration number PUN341S, the rear of which appeared to have been converted into a kitchen and living area, with a cooker, shelving and curtains in the windows.

Earlier, the jury was shown where the bodies of the teen-agers were found.

Retired police map maker Thomas Graveson, 66, said he had marked two sites in East Lothian where the bodies were discovered.

He told the court Miss Eadie was found in a field near Gosford House beside the A198 road leading from Gosford Sands.

Miss Scott was in another field, part of Coates Farm, near a bend on the road between the villages of Coates and Huntington.

Under cross-examination by defence counsel Ian Duguid, QC, Mr Graveson accepted the maps were recent and showed what the area looked like today, rather than in 1977.

Sinclair pleads not guilty to murdering both girls after raping and strangling them while acting along with his late brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton on October 15 and 16, 1977.

Sinclair, whose address was given as a prisoner at Glenochil Prison, has lodged three special defences, of incrimination, consent and alibi.

He claims that Hamilton committed the murders, that if there was any sexual contact it was with the consent of both females, and that he was fishing to the east of Cockenzie Power Station at the time of the offences.

Judge Lord Matthews warned the jury they should not discuss the case with friends or relatives.

He also said there could be serious consequences if they did their own research on the internet or asked questions on social media sites.

He told them: ‘It’s important to base your verdict on the evidence you heard in court and not on anything else.’

He said the case was expected to last two to three weeks.
