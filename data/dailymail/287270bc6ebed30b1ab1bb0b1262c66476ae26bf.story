A primary school teacher who molested pupils in front of other youngsters as they read out passages from a book in class was today jailed for four years.

Anthony Kerr, 70, would fondle victims after he beckoned them to the front and encouraging them to sit on his knee during English reading lessons.

He got away with his crimes for over three decades before nine former pupils at a primary school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, came forward to say they had been abused when they aged ten or under.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, the retired Kerr, pleaded guilty to 29 offences of sexual assault and was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Kerr was jailed for four years after the abuse, which occurred between 1979 and 1982, was discovered by police when nine former pupils came forward claiming they had been abused

Greater Manchester Police said the offences between 1979 and 1982 related to seven different victims.

Victims said Kerr, from Oldham, would ask boys to sit on his knee at the front of class while reading out load.

He would then sexually assault them as they sat on his knee.

Detective Constable Sue Chadwick, based at Oldham Public Protection Investigations Unit, said: 'Kerr's shocking and blatant abuse of innocent children has left a lasting scar on all his victims.

'Not only did he sexual abuse young boys, but he did it in front of the whole class.

'This added an extra element of humiliation to his crimes as the abuse was common knowledge among classmates.

Minshull Street Crown Court, where Kerr first admitted to 29 sexual assault offences

'Without the bravery of all his victims - particularly the first one to come forward - we would not be in a position to see Kerr finally receive his punishment.

'Their courage should hopefully encourage any other victims of sexual abuse to now come forward and speak to the police.'

Detective Inspector Rick Collins of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This case shows that when people come forward, regardless of the time that had elapsed, we can track down and prosecute offenders successfully. '
