It’s hard to tell whether the whole thing is a complete joke or if this guy is actually serious.

A man calling himself 'Mork Encino', believed to be from Utah, claims he will allow people to hunt him for $10,000 and will try his best to avoid being captured.

The unemployed 28-year-old says he is ‘pro-prey, looking for a change’ and will allow people to hunt him naked for an extra $2,000.

‘I seek hearty gents who fancy 
themselves sportsmen and bored of the usual game,’ he writes on his 
website Hunt Me 4 Sport. ‘I am a new breed of prey with thick pelt and 
smooth hide.

Mr Encino's inspiration could have come from the 1994 film Surviving the Game, starring Ice-T as homeless man Jack Mason.

Mr Mason, who lives on the streets, gets a job as a servant for a hunting party but soon realises that he is actually their prey.

‘I’m faster 
than a wild turkey, smart as any god***n wild boar and willing to make 
the ultimate sacrifice for the monetary health of my family.

‘If
I am trapped and killed you stand to earn the respect of your fellow 
hunters, a prize human mount for your wall and all income from any organ
harvest.’

His website 
features pictures of him hiding behind trees or in grass and sitting in a
‘strategic foetal position’, reported Deadspin.

Mr Encino says he will be unarmed and will ‘not attempt self-defence’, claiming all payment if he dies should go to his family.

He
claims to be currently living with his parents, who are threatening to 
kick him out, and is desperately trying to generate some cash.

Mr Encino says he has previously worked in construction, fast food, landscaping and cleaning.

His new line of work has received much media coverage but it is still unclear whether he will actually go through with any legitimate offers - and whether the whole thing is legal.

But the website and huge interest may well get him what he really wants - as he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he would like a job opportunity better than ‘being shot in the face’.

Legal experts told Deadspin the idea seems a hoax, but if it's actually real then problems could be caused if his hunting experiences are considered as solicitation to commit murder or assisted suicide.
