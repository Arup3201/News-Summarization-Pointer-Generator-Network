Her freebie trip to Barbados has already provoked strong criticism, but as she reclines on a sun lounger, sipping a cool drink and puffing on a cigarette, Sally Bercow does not appear to be too perturbed.

The Speaker's wife is on the Caribbean island as a guest of honour at the Institute of Travel & Tourism conference at the 5-star Hilton Barbados Hotel.

But once her gruelling schedule was complete - a one-hour speech on Twitter -  she quickly took to the beach with a friend, making the most of the trip for which she was paid £2,000.

All in a days' work: Despite criticism of her freebie trip as she reclines on a sun lounger, sipping a cool drink Sally Bercow does not appear to be too perturbed

Hard life: Mrs Bercow alternated between puffing on a cigarette and sipping a glass of wine in the hot sun

Hard day at the office: Mrs Bercow had tweeted before her trip how she was had 'lots of public speaking to do' but also added 'sunbathing'

It was only recently John Bercow defended his Labour-supporting wife saying it was wrong to expect her to 'sit in the background, walk a few paces behind her husband, slice mushrooms and never express an opinion'.

But as these as she relaxes in a blue leopard print bikini, it appears the mother-of-three has fully ensured that she does not fall in to this role.

Before arriving Mrs Bercow, 42, had tweeted that she had 'lots of public speaking to do' as well as some 'sunbathing'.

In May the attention-loving Mrs Bercow claimed her £2,000 fee was ‘not a fortune’ – but admitted she leapt at the chance to address delegates.

She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They said, “Will you come and speak in Barbados? We will pay for your flights and accommodation”.

'I thought about it for five seconds and said, “Yes, please, I’ll bite your arm off.” I’m not crazy.’

Relaxing: Mrs Bercow and a friend enjoyed a dip in the ocean before heading back to the beach for some alcohol and cigarettes

Smiles all round: The pair appeared to be enjoying themselves - Mrs Bercow was guest of honour at the Institute of Travel & Tourism conference at the 5 star Hilton Barbados Hotel

Criticism: Her free trip to the Caribbean island itself provoked criticism coming just months after her MP husband John Bercow allowed the Institute to host a cocktail party in his official House of Commons apartment

The Institute of Travel and Tourism offered her the 'dream job' just weeks after her husband allowed the organisation to host a Christmas cocktail party in his official Commons apartment.

One Tory MP said the arrangement 'stunk' – and accused Mrs Bercow of profiting from her position.

And Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the 
TaxPayers' Alliance campaign group, said: 'It is good that the Speaker 
uses his position to encourage the British tourist industry, but he and 
his wife need to be very careful not to put themselves in a position 
where the appearance is given that they are getting an advantage for 
helping this organisation'

Speaking at the conference the 
Speaker's wife admitted she regrets her 'cock-ups' on Twitter and that 
her nude photoshoot was a bad idea.

Admission: Speaking to guests the 42-year-old admitted her husband's job had opened doors for her - but maintained she wouldn't get offered jobs if she wasn't good at what she does

But otherwise all good.

Speaking to guests she admitted her husband's job had opened doors for her - but maintained she
wouldn't get offered jobs if she wasn't good at what she does.

She said: 'It’s very true to say that if my 
husband was not the speaker I would not have appeared on Celebrity Big 
Brother or become a regular on the Wright Stuff.

'But
it’s also true to say if I was crap at them I would not be invited 
back. Chances come along in life and you just have to take them.'

It didn't take long for the subject 
to turn to her love of Twitter - where she has courted controversy in 
recent weeks by revealing was 'obsessed' the idea of trying the banned 
drug mexxy and dismissing Jubilee revellers as 'flag waving loons'.

Tweeting moments after a ban on mexxy - methoxetamine - was announced, Mrs Bercow wrote:

'Am I the only one now slightly tempted to try mexxy before it becomes illegal? I won’t, obvs.

'I'm ‘obsessed with the stuff, despite never having heard of it ½ hr ago.

Her comment angered drug campaigner Maryon Stewart, whose daughter 
Hester, a medical student, died after taking another legal high said: 
‘These comments are utterly irresponsible.’

Mrs Stewart, whose Angelus Foundation campaigns for better drugs education added:

‘For someone in a position of respect and authority to imply that she would like to try it is outrageous and irresponsible.

‘How would she feel if one of her children lost the use of their bladder? And would she still like them to try it?’

And then on June 4 she tweeted commentary on Jubilee celebrations, writing: 'Underwhelmed by flotilla, detested bunting, despaired at mindless, flag-waving loons. But otherwise all good.'

Addressing conference guests, the 42-year-old admitted she loves provoking outrage on the site, but confessed she needs to 'think before she tweets.'

According to Travel Weekly she said: 'I think it’s absolutely fabulous partly because it’s really social and partly because it’s a great way of staying on top of the news. For the travel industry and companies it’s a really great way of engaging with their customers.

'As a brand or a person you are a 
human being and you can cock up. You have to think about what you are 
tweeting. You should think before you tweet and I do not always do 
that.'

The former public 
schoolgirl even allowed herself to admit it was probably an error to 
pose in the House of Commons wearing nothing by bedsheets in the pages 
of the Evening Standard last year.

She
said: 'When John became speaker suddenly the press were all over me. I 
thought I am not going to live in fear and decided to get it out for 
myself.'

Cock ups: Sally Bercow admits her bedsheet photoshoot was probably an error. Right: with her husband, Speaker of the House John Bercow

Mrs Bercow's recent tweets aren't the first to court controversy - she's been ruffling feathers since she signed up for the site in 2010, taking aim at the monarchy, tourists in London and the Pope.

Her tweets have even caused he legal problems. She was threatened with a lawsuit last year after tweeting her lack of affection for a string of British business who were going out of business.

She wrote: 'Altho' it's VERY sad that Habitat, Jane Norman, Carpetright, Thorntons, Focus DIY are going under, I never *actually* shop at any of 'em... Thorntons chocolate is yuck tasting rip-off, carpet is overrated (wood & rugs the way to go) and Jane Norman clothes for skinny minnies...'

Mrs Bercow was forced to apologise when Carpetright chairman Lord Harris of Peckham contacted her directly to explain that his company was not going under.

A spokesman later said: 'We have noted Mrs Bercow’s response and trust that next time she will check her facts before endangering thousands of jobs with a fabrication about the state of a perfectly solvent business.'
