An al Qaeda supergrass is to give evidence against hate preacher Abu Hamza and show he was a 'terrorist with a global reach'.

British-born Saajid Muhammad Badat will be the star witness when Hamza goes on trial in New York later this year, according to court papers.

Badat, who was jailed for plotting to blow up a U.S. passenger jet with shoe bomber Richard Reid and later released for agreeing to become the first terrorist supergrass, has agreed to give evidence via a video link.

Abu Hamza, who lost an eye and two hands fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, is also charged with providing material support to the al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon

Prosecutors in the U.S. believe Badat's evidence will help convict Hamza.

Assistant U.S. Prosecutor Ian McGinley said in court filings Badat will show Hamza 'was a terrorist leader of global reach, who among other things, sent his young lieutenants around the world to engage in terror training'.

Badat was released from prison in 2010 after striking a deal with British authorities to give evidence in future terror trials.

The 33-year-old had been jailed for 13 years in 2005 for taking part in the plot to blow up a U.S. passenger jet along with Richard Reid.

He admitted being personally briefed on the plan by terror mastermind Osama bin Laden.

But Badat backed out at the last minute while shoe bomber Reid went ahead and was foiled by passengers who subdued him before he could explode his bomb on the Paris to Miami flight in 2001.

Reid is serving a life sentence in the SuperMax prison in Colorado and will never be released.

Badat, from Gloucester in the south-west of England, has been re-housed using taxpayers' money and given money towards the cost of office space and education courses to help him get a job.

His mobile phone bills and internet are paid for by Scotland Yard.

U.S. prosecutors are hoping Badat's evidence will help secure a conviction of Hamza who was extradited from Britain after a lengthy legal battle.

He will give evidence by video link as he is afraid if he attends the trial in New York he will be arrested by U.S. authorities.

Hamza, who lost his hands and an eye fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, faces a life sentence if convicted.

He is accused of being involved in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian.

He is also charged with providing material support to the al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organize support for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

While being held in a U.S. prison, Hamza has complained about the harsh conditions and claims the stumps of his hands have become infected.

A plea to move to a 'softer' jail was rejected by U.S. authorities.

Badat is well known to U.S. terror chiefs and has already given evidence via a video link against a group of terrorists who plotted to blow up the subway.

He is also due to be the star witness at the trial of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed andÂ  bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghayth.

Abu Ghayth goes on trial later this month accused of holding terror training camps.

Prosecutors do not name Badat in their court filings but refer to him as a witness who .agreed to participate. in the shoe bomb plot in 2001.

U.S. Federal Judge Katherine Forrest, who will oversee Hamza's trial in April, is expected to agree to the request.
