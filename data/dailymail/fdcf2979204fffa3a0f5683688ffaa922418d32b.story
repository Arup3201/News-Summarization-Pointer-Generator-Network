A $600,000 steel sculpture has been dismantled after it burned a hole through a man's jacket by reflecting rays of the sun.

The 16-foot artwork, made up of two silver hemispheres, was billed as an 'interactive' structure that could turn text messages into a light and sound display if visitors used their phones inside it.

But the interaction went a touch further than expected when a man heard a sizzling sound - and watched as a hole appeared on his chest.

A bit too interactive: This $600,000 steel sculpture reflected a ray of light onto a man's jacket, burning a hole

According to the Calgary Herald, the man stood inside the sculpture, as directed, and tried to text through the metal in order to create a light effect.

Within seconds, a sun ray bounced off the interior and refracted into a narrow beam of light aimed directly at the man - and it was powerful enough to singe his jacket.

The visitor was uninjured, but the incident prompted city officials to place a blue fence around the sculpture to keep people from venturing inside.

Blasting city leaders, the center's president Carol Steiner - a physics graduate - raged that the issue could have been solved by a first year science student.

'You put a spherical surface out there in the sun — what did you expect?' she told the Herald. 'And what really gets me is they said, 'We had no idea.' Really. They should have had an idea. I mean, an elementary physics student, year one, could figure that out, find the focal point of that mirror.'

Anger: City officials have now been forced to dismantle the piece outside the Genesis Centre in Calgary

Officials at the Genesis Center for the Community of Wellness in Calgary, Canada, have now conceded that the structure - a gift from Berkeley, California, in fall 2012 - has to be taken down.

'It's a beautiful, shiny object. And that, I think is part of the problem,' Sarah Iley, the city's art and culture manager, told the Herald.  

The burning incident, which took place last summer, was the latest in a number of controversies surrounding the bespoke artwork, including disputes over the cost, scale and location of the piece. 

The issues have been a cause of outrage in the city, with authorities complaining the public never had a chance to appreciate it before protective fencing was put up.

'Here you have what's supposed to be this impressive piece of art and I think it was fairly impressive and then you've got this ugly construction fence around it, and it's at the main entrance, in a place of honour,' Genesis Centre president Carol Steiner said. 

They altered the angle of the structure, dulled the interior, and attempted to smooth certain parts of it using a hammer.

However, a year of attempts has failed to resolve the issues. 

It will now be put in storage while they attempt to come up with a more permanent solution.
