Christopher Todd sent so-called 'revenge porn' to his ex-girlfriend's mother after the pair split up. He has now been given a suspended sentence

A young woman was left distraught after her ex-boyfriend sent naked 'revenge porn' pictures of her to her parents.

Hannah Davison, 21, was mortified when Christopher Todd sent an intimate photo of her to her mother's phone after their break-up - in a message then opened by her father.

Todd has now been given a suspended sentence for sending the offensive message, which claimed Ms Davison was spreading sexually transmitted diseases.

Ms Davison, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, went out with Todd, 22, for more than a year before catching him in bed with another girl and ending the relationship.

But jilted Todd then bombarded his former girlfriend with texts and calls every time he was drunk.

She said: 'It went on for weeks, but I never expected that he would stoop so low as to involve my parents.'

On May 17 last year, Ms Davison left her phone at home when she went out. When Todd got drunk and couldn't make contact her, he began texting her mother, Donna, 57.

The messages claimed that her daughter was  spreading sexually transmitted diseases and listed the names of people that he claimed she had slept with.

When he got no response he sent an intimate picture of Ms Davison to her mother's phone.

The message was received at 3am and Ms Davison's father, Joseph, 59, was the first to see the disturbing image.

He said: 'When I lifted the phone and saw the reams of messages I was angry, I knew that Christopher hadn't treated my daughter well and I wished he would respect her decision to end the relationship.

'When I saw the picture I felt sick to my stomach, no one wants to see their own child like that.

'I was furious that he had put us all in such a horrible situation, I felt sorry for Hannah, her mum and myself.'

Ms Davison's parents got in touch with her through a friend and asked her to come home. Later, the family went to the police and made a formal complaint about the messages.

Ms Davison said Todd sent her texts for weeks after the split, but she did not expect him to involve her parents

Ms Davison said: 'The texts were disgusting. They claimed I had slept with half the town. If he had sent the message to anyone else I think I would have dealt with it and moved on.

'As horrible as it would have been, nothing is as bad as mum and dad reading those things about and seeing me in that way.'

Ms Davison said that she regrets letting Todd take the picture, but at the time they were in a committed and happy relationship and he she believed he could be trusted.

The government was warned earlier this year that too many people are getting away with posting 'revenge porn' online.

A House of Lords committee which looked into the issue found that social media websites are often poor at keeping track of the real identities of the people behind online profiles.

While the committee found there are laws that can be used to prosecute abusers, the scale of the problem makes it very difficult to monitor.

Lord Richard Best said: 'We were astonished at the scale of social media. One and a half billion people on Facebook, 500 million tweets a day.

'One could not possibly police all of this but in extreme cases prosecution must follow. We need to know who is responsible... and get to them.'

Todd, of Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, pleaded guilty to sending a communication of an indecent and offensive nature at a hearing at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court and was given an eight-week, suspended sentence.

Ms Davison's mother said in a victim impact statement that she felt the messages were sent 'maliciously by Todd to shock and upset her and cause distress and embarrassment to her and her daughter'.

Ms Davison, who works in a call centre, got together with Todd after met at South Tyneside College.

She said: 'I was attracted to him because we both liked the same things, we had a similar taste in music and films and a similar sense of humour.'

But just a few months into their relationship she began to notice a change in her boyfriend, especially when there was drink involved.

She said: 'He worked away so it was easy for us to get on most of the time but when he was home we argued and fought non-stop.

'We didn't see much of each other so even though he upset me a lot I made excuses for him, he treated me nicely and would take me out for food to apologise any time he hurt me.'

As the months went on her ability to see past Todd's mood swings diminished. She said: 'He was totally different after a drink and I saw sides of him that made me really uncomfortable.

'The way he treated me and other people made me slowly lose respect for him and when he cheated it was the final straw.'
