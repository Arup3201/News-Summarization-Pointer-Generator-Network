Chile's president went to a hospital Saturday to meet with a 14-year-old girl who shocked the country by going on YouTube to plead for the leader to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis.

The government quickly said no after the video began spreading on social media Thursday.

A government statement said President Michelle Bachelet talked with Valentina Maureira and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in the capital.

Officials did not release any information on what was said.

But the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Valentina taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician.

Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed.

'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.'

Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue.

Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life.

On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia.

'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said.

In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die.

'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said.

Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea.   

Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law.

Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. 

In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit.

'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said.

Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.'

'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira.

'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added.

Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.'

The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life.

'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said. 

'My message to all the parents in the world who have healthy kids is: Please take care of them. Love them.'
