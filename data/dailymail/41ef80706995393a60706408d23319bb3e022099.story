Prosecutors fear a 15-year-old girl fatally mauled by dogs outside a Mexico City park in mid-December may have been the first victim of a feral pack suspected of killing at least four other victims over the last month.

Authorities began capturing dogs in the park this week after a mother and her infant boy were found dead and covered in dog bites on December 29 and the bodies of a teenage couple were found covered in fatal bites from as many as 10 dogs a week later.

The four were believed to have been the only victims until the mother of 15-year-old Ana Gabriela Nataret Ramirez brought attention to their daughter to Milenio Television on late Tuesday.

Just day earlier, Mrs Ramirez's daughter died in hospital after found covered with apparent dog bites near the Cerro de la Estrella park in the poor southeastern Mexico City district of Iztapalapa on the night of December 16.

It was the same park where the bodies of the 26-year-old woman and her 1-year-old child were found, as well as the teenage couple.

The city prosecutor's office confirmed the details of the case on Wednesday and said it was looking into whether the 15-year-old's case was connected to the other deaths.

'An autopsy revealed that the victim had multiple injuries and puncture wounds on both arms,' the prosecutor's office said. 'After the events of recent days, the Mexico City district attorney's office broadened the investigation and confirmed the possibility of a new case of homicide resulting from wounds caused by dogs.'

The 26-year-old woman, Shunashi Mendoza, was missing her left arm, and prosecutors said that both she and the boy had bled to death and been partially eaten. The teenage couple, Alejandra Ruiz, 15, 
and her boyfriend Samuel Martinez, 16, also bled to death after visiting the park that afternoon.

Outcry: The white puppy was just one among a litter captured by police among outcry by even the victims' families on the dogs' responsibility in the attacks

Reaction: Rather than calming residents, photos of the forlorn dogs brought a wave of sympathy for the animals and upset of their potential death

On trial: The dogs' fur will be tested for blood and their stomach contents also examined to see if they are guilty of eating the victims

Injuries: One of the victims was found missing a left arm while all were found having bleed to death from their injuries

The girl called her 
sister Diana Ruiz at around 7 p.m. pleading for help, the sister told 
Milenio Television.

Mexico City prosecutors said that due to the gravity of the wounds they believed at least 10 dogs were involved in each attack.

Animal control officers swept the park for feral dogs again on Wednesday after capturing 36 animals over the last two days. Borough president Jesus Valencia told reporters at the pound where the animals are being kept that 33 dogs were captured but his office said later that 36 dogs had been caught.

In addition to rabies, the dogs have been tested for traces of human blood and DNA in order to determine if they were involved in the killings. Valencia said the rabies tests had all come back negative, and the prosecutors' office said the other tests were pending.

He said the borough was helping pay funeral costs for the victims and get psychological help for the relatives.

Hunted down by police and thrown behind 
bars, the first batch of stray pooches pictured have sparked outrage and
protest by even family members of the victims who say their injuries 
appeared too devastating to have been the result of dog bites.

Many believe the 12 scrawny and meek dogs pictured - arrested merely because they were found nearby the crime scene - could no way be the perpetrators of the horrific killings.

Forensics are testing the imprisoned dogs' fur for blood, and examining their stomach contents to determine whether they are guilty of partially eating the victims.

If damning evidence is found, the wild feral dogs - including Labradors and Golden Retrievers - will be placed on death row and given a lethal injection.

The photographs of the animals, released by the Mexico City's Attorney Generals Office on Monday, show just 12 of the dozens of dogs arrested in connection with the incident in recent days.

Authorities captured the stray pooches as they were located near to the scene of the attacks in the capital's poor Iztapalapa district.

And rather than evoke anger towards the brutal pack of wild dogs that savaged innocent victims in a park, the pictures sparked a wave of sympathy for the animals throughout Mexico.

Doubts about their involvement in the killings arose as the images showed Labradors, Golden Retrievers and a Border Collie stood timidly in their cells.

The killings have set off a fierce debate about how to handle the thousands of stray dogs that roam Mexico City.

In response to the killings, police searched the urban park for dogs and tested dozens of captured animals on Tuesday. The dogs live in caves and hollows in the area.

But after images of the dogs were released, activists started an online campaign protesting the dogs' innocence and calling for authorities not to euthanize them.

The
hashtag for the campaign became the top trending topic on Twitter in 
Mexico by midday Tuesday, with some users furiously accusing the 
authorities of cruelty to animals and others sarcastically calling the 
dogs 'political prisoners' and mocking the fuss over the fate of the 
animals.

Many people re-posted the images of the dogs staring sadly from behind bars at an animal shelter.

Liliana Hernandez, a psychologist and self-described street dog rights activist who lives near the park said: 'Officer, you're hunting for dogs again, but don't you already supposedly have the 25 killers in custody?'

Hernandez said many people let their dogs out during the day because their cinderblock homes are too small to keep them inside.

Residents of their neighborhood started running frantically to collect their dogs when police began seizing strays Monday night, she said.

The furor has forced a public response from Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera, who called for animal-rights groups to help study the guilt or innocence of the 25 dogs, and the broader effort to reduce the number of street dogs in Mexico City.

He said: 'We're not taking any decision. The dogs are in a shelter and we have to check on their health,' he told reporters after a midday press conference.

He also said the government would launch a new program to spay and neuter dogs, sending 25 mobile surgical units to neighborhoods where residents would be encouraged to take advantage of free sterilisation for their pets.

Mexico City Attorney General Rodolfo Rio held a news conference late Tuesday to reiterate the victims bled to death after dogs mauled them.

'We didn't find any other type of wound different from those produced by dogs,' Rios said.

Antemio Maya, president of the Street Dog Protection association, said many people in Mexico City treat dogs as disposable, buying one for their children for Christmas and abandoning it in a park or suburb when the responsibility becomes overwhelming.

Residents who live around the park and relatives of the 16-year-old high school boy who was killed refused to accept that dogs killed the youngest member of their family.

'It's not logical. I mean the dogs are small, they are domestic dogs. We don't believe what the prosecutor's office is telling us,' brother Enrique Martinez told The Associated Press.

Martinez said police told the family the couple was perhaps carrying a fish fillet which alerted the dogs. He said identifying the body was a horrible experience for him and his loved ones.

Fatal maulings of humans by dogs are extremely rare, but Dr. Sophia Yin, executive board member of the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, said they can happen, particularly when dogs that are used to being around people are moving in large groups, and people shout or run in fear when accosted by the animals.

'It's hard to tell people, stand completely still and relax, don't turn your back. Almost anything else you do can get the dog more excited,' Yin said. 'The more animals involved, the higher the excitement is.'

A veterinarian at the Iztapalapa shelter where the 25 dogs were being held said it appeared that at least one of the captured dogs had been a pet.

'A family came and recognized a dog but we couldn't give him to them because investigators have to decide what to do,' he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

Rios said authorities will keep the trapped dogs until investigators determine whether they were involved in the attacks.

He said people who can prove one of those dogs belongs to them can take the animal home. He said the rest will be put up for adoption.

Tens of thousands of dogs are euthanised 
each year in Mexico if they are captured by animal control officers and 
not claimed within 72 hours.
