The Waldorf Astoria New York has a rich history that few other hotels can compete with.

In March 1893, millionaire William Waldorf Astor opened the 13-story Waldorf Hotel. The Astoria Hotel opened four years later.

When the Waldorf Astoria New York opened on Park Avenue in 1931 it was the largest hotel in the world and remains one of the largest Art Deco structures still standing anywhere in the world.

In 1993 the city named it - and its spectacular interiors - an official New York City landmark.

The hotel prides itself on the design philosophy that no two guest rooms are exactly the same. 

As well as 1,413 rooms it houses three restaurants - Peacock Alley, Bull and Bear Prime Steakhouse and Oscar's - five lounges not to mention a secret underground train platform  used to enable presidents and VIPs to enter from nearby Grand Central Terminal in secret.

Every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed here, including President Obama, who sleeps in the 35th floor Presidential Suite every time he’s in town.

Celebrity heiress Paris Hilton even grew up in the hotel and fondly recalls meeting visiting presidents and sneaking into parties and bar mitzvahs.

The Waldorf has also featured in countless movies including Scent Of A Woman, Coming To America and the 1945 Ginger Rogers film Week-End at the Waldorf. 

The Mad Men episode The Waldorf Stories was also set at an awards event held in the famous hotel.

‘This relationship represents a unique opportunity for our organizations to work together to finally maximize the full value of this iconic asset on a full city block in midtown Manhattan.’

Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel in 1949 and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972.

Hilton announced in February that it would consider selling all or a part of the property. At the time Nassetta also said the company would consider residential, office and retail uses.

In December Hilton raised $2.35 billion in a record initial public offering for the hotel industry. The company’s other properties include namesake hotels in San Francisco, New York and Chicago.

Shares of Hilton rose 2.8 percent to $25 in pre-market trading in New York after the announcement of the deal on Monday morning.

Anbang, founded in 2004, provides financial and insurance services to more than 20 million customers.
