A New York woman said she was left shaking after finding a letter inside a Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag purportedly written by a man in a Chinese prison factory that was mass-producing the distinctive carry-all.

Stephanie Wilson, 28, an Australian who lives in Harlem, said she found the message while reaching into the bad for a receipt and it said 'HELP HELP HELP'.

The desperate cry was written in blue ink on white-lined paper and included a passport-sized photo of a man - who called himself Tohnain Emmanuel Njong - in an orange jacket, as well as a Yahoo email address.

'I read the letter and I just shook - I couldn't believe what I was reading,' Wilson said in an interview with DNAinfo New York.

Desperate cry: New York-based Australian expat Stephanie Wilson, 28, found this letter hidden within her Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag, purportedly from a man who was enslaved in a prison factory that was mass-producing the bags in China. The department store have since confirmed they make the bags in the country, but have not said where

The note said: 'We are ill-treated and work like slaves for 13 hours every day producing these bags in bulk in the prison factory. Thanks and sorry to bother you.'

Wilson said she found it in September 2012 after buying a pair of Hunter rain boots and passed it on to the Laogai Research Foundation - a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group founded to fight human rights abuses in Chinese prisons - who began investigating.

But Njong's Yahoo email address bounced back, so the nonprofit was unable to locate him.

Harry Wu, the founder of Laogai Research Foundation, spent 19 years in a Chinese prison factory, known as laogai., and that Njong took a huge risk both writing and sending it.

'There would be solitary confinement until you confess and maybe later they increase your sentence - or even death,' Wu said.

His organization referred the letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which investigates allegations of American companies using forced labor to make their products.

Homeland Security officials confirmed to DNAinfo that they were made aware of the letter, but could not say if they investigated it or are currently looking at Saks in connection to it.

A DHS official said it's not the first plea letter from China that has ended up on American shores.

According to DHS senior policy adviser Kenneth Kennedy, the department was made aware of a woman in Oregon who made international news in 2012 when she discovered a similar letter detailing abuse and grueling labor in a Chinese prison when it fell from a Halloween decoration she'd bought at Kmart.

The Oregon letter was anonymous, though The New York Times later tracked down the man who said he wrote it.

Distinctive: The black and white Saks Fifth Ave bags are commonplace in New York and Los Angeles. The department store have confirmed they have them made in China and investigating the claims made in the letter

A representative for Saks Fifth Avenue confirmed that the store was notified of the letter by the Laogai Research Foundation in December 2013 and said the company took the allegation seriously and launched an investigation.

Saks also confirmed to DNAinfo that the store's shopping bags are made in China, but didn't have any further information.

Two U.S. laws make it illegal for imported products to be made using slave, convict or indentured labor.

DNAinfo managed to track down a man who claimed to be Njong, admitted to writing the letter and knew specific details about what was in it.

He said he wrote the letter during his three-year prison sentence in the eastern city of Qingdao, Shandong Province.

Njong said he a wrote a total of five letters while in the prison, some in French that he hid in bags emblazoned with French words, and others in English.

Njong, who is now 34, said he had been teaching English in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen when he was arrested in May 2011 and charged with fraud, a crime he said he never committed.

He said he was held in a detention center for 10 months while awaiting a government-sponsored lawyer and was barred from contact with the outside community.

Njong said each prisoner was required to meet a daily production quota of what they working on - bet it shopping bags, electronics or sewing garments - and that they were given a pen and paper to record their productivity.

This is what he used to pen the letters, hiding under his covers at night so no one would see.

Njong's family did not know where he was for the whole time he was prison, because he was not permitted to contact anyone following his arrest.

He said he was discharged from prison in December 2013 after receiving a sentence cut for good behavior and finally reunited with relatives, who presumed him dead.

After struggling to find work in his home country, Njong recently moved to Dubai and secured a job that will allow him to stay there.

He said that though his imprisonment ran its course without intervention, he was happy that his letter made its way into at least one person's hands.

'It was the biggest surprise of my life,' Njong told DNAinfo.Â 

'I am just happy that someone heard my cry.'
