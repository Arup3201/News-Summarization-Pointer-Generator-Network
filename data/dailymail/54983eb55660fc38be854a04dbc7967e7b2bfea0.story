The distraught parents of a three-year-old girl who was run over as she played on her scooter said last night they had been ‘robbed of the sparkle of life’.

Toddler Rosa Simon was playing outside her family home on a quiet cul-de-sac when she was knocked down by a neighbour late on  Tuesday afternoon.

With his vision obscured by a hedge, the man accelerated out of his drive without seeing the little girl and killed her instantly.

Paul Simon, the father of three-year-old Rosa Simon, told the BBC he heard a big crash and believed his daughter died instantly. He described her as their 'fantastic, special, loving, exuberant child'

She died in Ipswich Hospital last night despite attempts to revive her by her mother Sheeba, 36, who is a nurse.

The
 accident has raised concerns about the safety of scooters, which allow 
children to race away from their parents and out of the eyeline of 
oncoming traffic.

Reports
 suggest there has been a huge increase in casualties involving the 
toys, with many children using them without wearing a helmet.

Her father Paul Simon described her as their 'fantastic, special, loving, exuberant child'. 

In a statement released through police, her family said: 'Rosa was a much beloved and loving daughter and sister.

'Small in size, but a giant in character, kindness and with a sheer joy at being alive.

'It has been a privilege to have known her as parents and as siblings. She made us better and happier people.

The young girl was knocked down and killed on this quiet cul-de-sac in Hadleigh, Suffolk, yesterday

'We are devastated by losing her. Her death has robbed us of much of the sparkle of life. We now ask that, as a grieving family, we are given time to be with our dear family and friends.'

'Rosa was a much beloved and loving daughter and sister.

'We are devastated by losing her. Her death has robbed us of much of the sparkle of life. We now ask that, as a grieving family, we are given time to be with our dear family and friends.' 

Mr Simon said his daughter was, 'in one of those wonderful heady moments that three- year-olds have', racing around the cul-de-sac on her scooter.

He ran to her aid with his wife after hearing a 'big crash'.

He added: 'We believe she died instantly.'  

The driver of the car, who is not related to the girl, received medical treatment for shock, Suffolk Police said.

No one has been arrested. 

Rosa leaves behind an older sister, Millie, and a older brother, Thomas.

Neighbour Carla Maloney, 41, said Rosa and her five-year-old son were 'best friends'.

The mother-of-two said: 'Rosa was just a lovely, sweet little girl who always had a smile on her face.

'She played with my son and they were best friends. He is only five-years-old and he doesn't understand that she has gone.'

Tributes have been left at the scene where Rosa was 
killed while she was playing on her scooter

Her father led the tributes to the young girl, but many others left flowers and notes at the scene

Brian Riley, a county and district councillor who knows the family, said: 'People are very upset.

'There are ripples running through the town. The parent's are well-known members of the community.'

Mr Simon, who studied at Oxford University, works as a communications manager for Babergh District Council.

Charlie Adan, Chief Executive of Babergh District Council, said: 'Our thoughts are with our colleague Paul and his family at this terrible time.

'I hope Paul will know that all his colleagues are deeply saddened and we are here to offer whatever support we can.

'All of the staff and councillors at Babergh and Mid Suffolk send our sincere condolences to Paul and his family.'
