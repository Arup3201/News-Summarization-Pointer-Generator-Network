Big softie: The TV mogul dotes on his two fur babies

They have run riot at Simon Cowell's multi-million dollar Hollywood home - and helped him prepare for impending fatherhood.

And in a sign of just how spoilt cute Yorkshire terrier puppies Squiddly and Diddly are - they are being flown back to the UK for Christmas by security guard, MailOnline can reveal.

While music mogul Cowell, 54, will leave for his annual Caribbean jaunt following the final of tonight's X Factor final, his pets will be flown in business class on an Air France flight to Paris.

From there, they will either drive or travel on the Eurostar across the English Channel to Cowell's $14.4million London home, where they will stay for the holidays.

Indeed, the dogs - brother and sister - will set up home at the exclusive London address and stay there until Cowell and his pregnant girlfriend Lauren Silverman arrive in the Spring.

The couple will travel to London - along with their newborn son, due on February 28 - as Cowell - whose fortune is now estimated at $370million - will be filming Britain's Got Talent.

A business class flight on Air France will cost around $10,000.

And a source said; 'Squiddly and Diddly are very well looked after, to say the least.

'But they have to travel in business class as Simon and Lauren really don't want to put them in the hold.'

Because dogs aren't allowed to travel in the cabin on a British carrier, Squiddly and Diddly will land in Paris before being taken to London.

The source added: 'Squiddly and Diddly have been to the vet and had their shots. When they're in the UK, they'll get their UK passports which will make it easier for them to travel.'

Cowell and Lauren adopted the dogs in October - and he says they are helping him ‘road test’ his £22 million Beverly Hills mansion before the arrival of their son, nicknamed Baby Simon.

Cradling the puppies in his arms, a 
clearly smitten Cowell told the Mail on Sunday last month: ‘I’m 
experimenting right now with Squiddly and Diddly.

‘I
 think dogs are good training for babies. They are still puppies and 
they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house.

‘This
 is a bit of a road test for the real thing. Squiddly is the girl and 
Diddly is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun. I would say 
to anyone thinking about getting a dog – just do it. They bring so much 
happiness into your life.’

The Yorkies have free run of the house and spend most nights curled up at the foot of their master’s king-sized bed.

Cowell,
 who once admitted he was ‘fanatical’ about everything in his house 
being ‘just so’, has clearly relaxed his rules for the new additions to 
his family.

Meanwhile, as the Mail revealed, Lauren, seven-months pregnant with Cowell's baby, will be spending Christmas with her son Adam, seven.

But the couple will spend time together over Christmas period as she will be renting a villa in the Caribbean with her son - while Cowell will be cruising around Barbados on the Slipstream yacht with friends including ex Sinitta, for the festive season.

When Adam - whom she considers her first priority - spends New Year with his father, New York property millionaire magnate Andrew Silverman, the 36-year-old brunette will join Cowell on board.

Cowell’s romance with Lauren is said to have developed during past Caribbean jaunts.

Their flirtations became obvious to friends during Simon’s Christmas break to Barbados in 2011, when Lauren and her husband were invited. Their divorce was made final earlier this month.

They are now widely expected by friends to marry.

Their baby boy will be born in New York, where Lauren's mother Carole Saland can travel in from her home in Florida.

And so far, Cowell and Lauren have been practicing at parenthood with their dogs.

In one 
shot, Diddly is seen drinking water from a fine china cup and saucer 
placed on a designer leather side table while Squiddly – who is 
virtually identical to her brother except for an ear which flops over – 
perches on a silk cushion on the custom-made sofa.

Another picture shows the pair relaxing on top of Cowell’s magnificent grand piano. A source said: ‘Simon is devoted to the dogs. He adores them and they have the run of the place.

'Whenever they go missing they’ve usually raced upstairs to find Simon. Normally there isn’t a pillow out of place but he’s relaxed the rules for the puppies.

They are very much his babies but he’s definitely the master. He went away recently and  when he came back he had to have words with Diddly because he was strutting a little.

‘There was a bit of a drama when one of them almost fell into the swimming pool the other day. Obviously the whole house will be properly child–proofed before the baby arrives. But the dogs have been a wonderful addition to the household.  Simon has a dog trainer but it’s pretty obvious they are the ones training him now.’

It is thought Cowell named the pooches after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid called Squiddly Diddly.

But during an earlier season of the US X Factor, he referred to his fellow judges Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul by the moniker, dismissing them with the words: ‘I think the audience at home are going to disagree with Squiddly and Diddly here.’

There has been online speculation that a 
private chef cooks for the pups, but it is, in fact, Cowell who is in 
charge at meal times. They are being raised on organic canned dog-food, 
which their master feeds them twice a day. He and Lauren walk them 
together every evening.

The puppies are house-trained and have had piles of dog toys lavished upon them, according to insiders.

Cowell says he will set up a Twitter account for the Yorkies soon, and has already used his own account to post pictures of the dogs.

One was labelled, ‘Happiness is 2 puppies asleep’, another shows a dozing Squiddly with her eyes rolling back with the caption ‘Squiddly has gone mad’ and in another she is lounging on his bed with her tongue poking out, with the message: ‘Squiddly wants an ice cream.’

The pups have already had a taste of the spotlight, appearing on TV  in America as their owner filmed segments promoting the latest series of the American X Factor.

Cowell has long been a dog-lover and has said: ‘I’m going to leave my money to charity, probably dogs and kids. I don’t believe in passing it on from one generation to another.’

He is also a huge fan of dog acts, backing talented pooch Pudsey to win Britain’s Got Talent last year.
