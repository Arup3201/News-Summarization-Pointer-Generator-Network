Shocking case: Kasey Nesbitt, 35, has been charged with rape and aggravated burglary in connection to the September 29 attack on a 100-year-old Wichita woman 

Break-in: Police say Nesbitt and several accomplices forced their way into the victim's home in the 800 block of South Crestway in Wichita 

The victim, who is not being named due to the nature of the crime, said the men were in her home for several hours.

According to police, forensic evidence linked Nesbitt to the rape. He is being held in the Sedgwick County Jail on $250,000 bond.  

Life of crime: Nesbitt, a documented criminal, has a rap sheet going back to 2000, which mostly includes burglary and theft convictions 

The suspect, a documented gang member, has a lengthy criminal record going back to 2000, which includes multiple convictions on burglary and theft charges. Court records obtained by The Wichita Eagle showed that he was released from prison in January 2013. 

Nesbitt was arrested Monday in connection to an unrelated burglary and was already in jail when he was named a suspect in the rape case.

The disturbing incident took place on the night of September 29 when a group of men broke into the house in the 800 block of South Crestway in Wichita, police said. .

At around 7am the following day, the alleged rape victim walked to a neighbor's home for help.

The elderly resident said that she was awakened at around 9pm by strangers, who forced their way inside through the back door.

A medical examination determined that the woman had been sexually violated.

Wichita Police Captain Troy Livingston said that the victim is 'a very strong and brave woman' who was able to give them information on the suspects. .

Nesbitt is due back in court October 29. The station KWCH reported that if convicted, prosecutors plan to ask for a harsher sentence for Nesbitt because the victim was particularly vulnerable. 

'All rape is a deplorable crime, but when you look at the age of our victim it becomes a little bit more concerning and a little bit more disturbing,' Livingston said.
