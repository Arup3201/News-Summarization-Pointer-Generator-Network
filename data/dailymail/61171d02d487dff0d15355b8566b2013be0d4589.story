A gay churchgoer has spoken of his torment at the hands of fellow members - who kidnapped and beat him in an attempt to 'rid him of homosexual demons'. 

Matthew Fenner said the group, who belong to The Word of Faith Fellowship church in Spindale, North Carolina, beat and strangled him for being gay last year. 

Five people - Sarah Covington Anderson, Adam Christopher Bartley, Brooke McFadden Covington, Justin Brock Covington and Robert Louis Walker Jr.- have been indicted on simple assault and kidnapping charges.

Anderson also faces a charge of assault by strangulation, according to Rutherford County Sheriff's Office.

Mr Fenner told WSPA.com: 'I honestly thought I was going to die. My head was like being flung back, my vision was going brown and black.

'I couldn't breathe and I'm sitting here thinking if I don't get out of this, I'm probably going to die.'

He also claims that what happened to him is not an isolated incident and he hopes by pushing his case, he can shed light on the truth.

In an affidavit, Mr Fenner said Sarah Covington Anderson told him he was 'disgusting' because of his sexual orientation.

He continues that the vicious beating he received was intended to ‘break me free of the homosexual "demons"'.

But the church's attorney Josh Farmer insists Mr Fenner was never harmed and the indicted members are 'innocent of the charges leveled against them'. 

'We are adamant that no one ever physically harmed Mr. Fenner,' he told WSPA. 'The church does not target members who are gay.'

The grand jury met on Monday and Mr Fenner said his mother and brother, who are still members of the church, were two of the witnesses who testified against him.

The Word of Faith Fellowship has been at the heart of the Spindale community for more than three decades after it was established by Pastors Sam and Jane Whaley in 1979.
