Cut down: President Obama said he is cutting back on playing basketball as he is getting 'a little older and creakier'

President Barack Obama has cut back on playing basketball because of the aches and pains of old age.

Mr Obama told retired National Basketball Association star Charles Barkley he was limiting his basketball playing to about once a month because 'things happen.'

In an interview that aired on Sunday, Mr Obama said: 'One is, you just get a little older and creakier.

'The second thing is, you've got to start thinking about elbows and you break your nose right before a State of the Union address.

The 53-year-old was speaking about healthcare reform law in the interview, which broadcast on the TNT network before the NBA All-Star Game.

Discussing the aging process, the president said: 'You wake up and something hurts and you don't know exactly what happened, right?'

Mr Obama said he was enjoying watching his 12-year-old daughter, Sasha, play basketball.

When Barkley commented that he struggled watching his own daughter play because he wanted her 'to be really, really good.'

Mr Obama said: 'I think it's a difference if you're a Hall of Famer. You probably have a higher standard than somebody who was a good high school player.'

Mr Obama is known as a big basketball fan - and recently honored Miami Heat players at the White House after a second straight NBA title in the past.

Last month, Mr Obama described in detail how the Heat rallied from behind with less than a minute on the clock to win Game 6 before clinching in the seventh.

The Obamas are well-known advocates of a healthy, active lifestyle - with the president regularly seen playing golf with a number of high profile guests, including Tiger Woods.

In February last year, the President took a break to enjoy a 'boy's weekend' away from his wife and daughters to spend time with the golfing pro.

After getting pointers from Butch Harmon, Woods' former coach, the duo played a round at The Floridian Yacht and Golf Club.

In August last year, Michelle Obama revealed she encourages her daughters to play tennis while attending the first day of the US Open.

At the time, the First Lady said: 'It’s a great way to stay healthy, to stay fit, it’s a lifelong sport, it’s something I’ve tried to tell my kids - I forced them into playing tennis ... it’s a great way to stay active.'

Obama was also presented with a signed ball during the ceremony
