The manager of an upscale eatery in Atlanta, Georgia, kicked a four-year-old boy out at lunchtime because his sleeveless Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles t-shirt violated the dress code.

Lewis Roberts and his family went to the Tavern at Phipps Plaza for lunch, but they never made it to their table.

The hostess told them Lewis's t-shirt did not comply with their 'gentlemen's dress code' and therefore he would have to leave.

Turtle power: Lewis Roberts loves his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles t-shirt, but it got him kicked out of an Atlanta restaurant

Lunch rush: Lewis's aunt Keri Smith said being kicked out of the busy restaurant at lunchtime was embarrassing

The little boy had chosen his own outfit that day and was particularly proud of his green t-shirt, reports WXIA.

The family asked to speak to the manager of the restaurant, sure that the hostess must be mistaken, but the manager agreed with the hostess.

She explained that even though Lewis is only four years old, the dresscode applies to 'gentlemen of all ages' and they were again asked to leave the premises.

'If we would have thought for a minute that he was inappropriately dressed, we would have gone to a different restaurant to save the embarrassment,' Lewis's aunt Keri Smith told WXIA.

The station contacted the restaurant for comment and initially received none, however, upper management has now made a statement.

Dress code: Men are not allowed to wear sleeveless shirts at the Tavern, but the sign says nothing about four-year-old boys

According to WXIA, manager Amber Stewart said the rule, which stipulates no sleeveless shirts, applies to men only, and not women or children.

'It was an embarrassing misunderstanding on our part. She's a manager in training who had a gross misunderstanding of our policy. We apologize and are reaching out to the family,' she said.

The family says that having spoken to the restaurant and accepted their apology, they plan to return to the restaurant.

It's highly likely the Tavern will experience some turtle power in the near future.
