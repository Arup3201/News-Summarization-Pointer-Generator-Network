A 3D artist from Oregon proposed to his girlfriend by getting her to play a video game he had created just for her.

It took Robert Fink five months to create the video game, and several anxious minutes as he sat in the background watching Angel White play it.

Angel had to guide a knight to collect parts of a gold ring and save a princess in the game, before Robert's marriage proposal appeared on the screen.

Test: Robert told his girlfriend, Angel White, that his office needed people to try a new video game

Emotional: As Robert's proposal flashed on to the screen, a camera caught Angel's reaction

To get his girlfriend to play the game without raising any suspicions, Robert told her his office, SuperGenius Studios, needed people to try out a project.

He set up cameras in the test room, and a co-worker pretended to quiz Angel about the game, called Knight Man: A Quest for Love, as she started playing.

When Angel got to the end of the game, and clicked 'Yes' to accept Robert's proposal, the designer was already down on one knee by her side.

He had also arranged for the couple's family and friends to be waiting in a nearby room to help them celebrate afterwards.

The proposal took a lot of planning for Robert, who designed the platform game with two friends. He said it was easy to convince Angel to try the game as she had tested other projects at his office before.

On a website the couple set up to share the proposal, he said: 'She is nearing the whole end sequence and my heart feels like it's about to 'splode.'

Happy ending: The knight goes into a castle to save a princess, which triggered the proposal

After saving the Princess in the game a message floated on to the screen that said: 'I have searched far and wide and braved
 many dangers searching for my one and only. I believe with all my heart
 that I have found you ... Angel White, would you do me the honor of sharing your life with me?'

'I was so excited, and so happy and 
nervous, and just exploding with emotion,' Angel told Fox 12. 'Just 
realizing that he made this, it was incredible.'

The couple had been dating for two and a half years, and Robert said he knew she was the one from the moment he met her.

'The first thought in my head when I saw her was "She's beautiful ... and she plays video games ... I want to marry her",' he said.
