Gerard Pique will consider leaving Barcelona if he continues to warm the bench for the La Liga giants, Mundo Deportivo reports.

The paper cites three key pieces of information in the 'Pique case'. Firstly, they report that his third successive place on the bench against Almeria has left him upset.

He believes he is playing well, and boss Luis Enrique has even told the player it is nothing personal.

Despite this, if there is no change against Sevilla, Valencia, Espanyol and APOEL, he will consider leaving the club.

MARCA run with the headline, 'The legend continues', speaking of the 'insatiable' Cristiano Ronaldo, who won two more awards in Spain last night, given out by the newspaper itself.
