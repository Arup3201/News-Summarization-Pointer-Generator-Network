After years of travel restrictions towards Cuba, Americans may soon be able to fly to the island on their country's namesake airline.

American Airlines president said that his company was looking to add regular commercial flights from Miami. 

'We don’t have anything to announce today,' American Airlines president Scott Kirby said to reporters, 'but we will be anxious to start serving Cuba as soon as it’s legally allowed.'

The US government has lifted many restrictions on traveling to its southern neighbor this month after a deal to reestablish full diplomatic ties was struck by Barack Obama and Raul Castro at the end of last year.

American Airlines president Scott Kirby has said flights to Cuba will begin 'as soon as it's legally allowed'.

Former Cuban president Fidel Castro released a letter yesterday saying that he does not trust the US but backs the restoration of relations that were severed when he rose to power in the early 1960s.

American, JetBlue and Sun Country currently offer charter flights to the Caribbean island, of which American operates 20 from Tampa and Miami. 

Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue and Delta Airlines have all said they are interested in flying to Cuba, though it is unclear when routes will open.

United said that it would look to begin flights from Newark and Houston.

A bilateral Air Service Agreement must be negotiated before passengers to travel to Cuban airports from the US, according to the Guardian.

Such an agreement already exists from Cuba's pre-revolutionary days as a hub of beach resorts.

Travelers to Cuba no longer have to obtain an license from the US government under the loosened restrictions, and trips are allowed for 12 reasons including educational tours, and journalism.

Pure tourism is not one of the categories.

American Airlines had previously said that it was reviewing the changes in US law and how they affect its Cuba policy.

Americans are not banned from Cuba and those wishing to go to the communist state before this year could also do so in violation of US law by going through a third country such as Mexico or the Bahamas.

About 100,000 Americans visit the island every year along with 400,000 visits from Cubans living in the United States, according to The New York Times.

Cuba's tourism industry already caters to numbers of Canadian, European and Latin American visitors, though it remains to be seen how it will be affected by a potential influx of Americans.

Credit card companies American Express and Mastercard have also said that they would begin doing business in Cuba, though no timeline has been given for when transactions could first be processed. 

The spread of US businesses to the island comes after a long-awaited political breakthrough last year brokered by Pope Francis.

In a deal that included the release of 53 anti-Castro political dissidents and the return of American contractor Alan Gross, the US agreed to work towards restoring full diplomatic relations.

The US will also ease restrictions on the amount Cuban goods being brought into the US and the amount of money that Cubans can send back to relatives, though Congressional approval is required to fully end the embargo.

The decades-long stand-off between the US and Cuba was marked by incidents that threatened to send the Cold War to boiling point.

CIA-backed Cuban exiles suffered a bloody defeat in the Bay of Pigs invasion and, during the missile crisis, US warships blockaded the island.

The embargo hurt the Caribbean island's economy but it failed to unseat the communist government led by the Castro brothers.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics predicts that trade between the US and Cuba could top $10billion annually

Experts said easing the embargo would breathe life into Cuba's moribund economy, which has seen bilateral US trade shrivel from $962million in 2008 to $401million last year.

A 2014 report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicted that two-way merchandise trade could surpass $10billion annually once the embargo is lifted.

With their window for action closing, both sides were under pressure to make a gesture. 

Obama has only two years left in office. Fidel Castro, who has had a colossal presence in Cuba for half a century, was conspicuously absent from the detente sealed by his brother. 

Among the world leaders welcoming the developments was French President Francois Hollande, who said a rapprochement was needed to put an end to the Cold War 'once and for all'.

Speaking outside a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the steps 'encouraging.' Meanwhile, the EU is seeking to normalise its own ties with Havana.
