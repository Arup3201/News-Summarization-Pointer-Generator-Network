The ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse has told a court today he was optimistic of having a relationship with a woman he is accused of raping twice.

Reg Traviss, 35, denies two counts of rape and told Southwark Crown Court: 'There is no truth in this allegation whatsoever.'

The 27-year-old woman said earlier she woke twice in the early hours of New Year's Eve 2011 to find Traviss raping her.

Reg Traviss, pictured with Any Winehouse in 2010, said he did not go out often following the singer's death in July 2011

However the filmmaker said the pair had consensual sex at his flat after getting merrily drunk together at three bars in central London.

Today he told the jury of six men and six women he had not been out for several months 'whatsoever' after Amy Winehouse died.

He says he was seduced by the woman who invited him to bed. 

The film director, who was going out with the Back to Black star when she died in July 2011, said the following morning he and the alleged victim kissed as he walked her half way to the Tube and even made further plans to see each other.

Asked by his QC Ian Winter if he thought he and the woman could have a relationship, he said: 'I sort of came away from that evening thinking this could be really good, this could be the start of something.

'I wasn’t looking for a girlfriend but she is somebody I have known for a long time and that there could be something in this.'

When he did not hear back from her weeks later, after she had gone to meet a man in New York, he said: 'I thought it’s a pity and that she had got together with somebody else or just blown me out, it’s a pity.

'I thought we would meet up again and be friends after a certain time had elapsed and just go back to being friends.'

Traviss, appearing in the witness box in his trademark black collared jacket and slick-backed hair, said he was shocked when the police got in touch in April with a sex allegation against him.

He was not initially told who had made the complaint and said he thought it might have been a stalker inventing an allegation.

Traviss said he was ‘completely and utterly flabbergasted’ by the allegations and believed he and his alleged victim had shared a ‘great night’.

Traviss told the court he and the woman had protected, consensual sex twice at his flat.

He said on the first occasion the woman had asked him to get in bed with her after he had offered to sleep on the sofa.

He said she was someone he knew and trusted the woman and she instigated sex on both occasions. 

He added: ‘She was leading it just as much as I was going along with it. It was completely equal.

‘She was completely together mentally, compos mentis, she was completely together. She was wide awake.’

Traviss told the court they had stopped having sex after the woman said they should stop.

They then chatted in the living room before she led him back to bed, he said.

He told jurors that when they finished she had wanted to carry on but, after some time, he had told her ‘I’m tired. I need to go to sleep’.

Prosecutor Katherine Lumsdon told jurors the woman had been ‘very drunk’ and had been ‘propping herself up’ in the last of three bars she had gone to with Traviss on December 30, 2011.

But Traviss said today that she was not as drunk as she claimed to be and had held open a 11ft high glass door for him when the left the final bar at around 3.30am.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
