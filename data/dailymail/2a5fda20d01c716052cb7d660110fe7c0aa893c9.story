Waiting for an hour at the chaotic baggage carousel may be a thing of the past, as travellers at London City airport can take advantage of a new service that delivers your checked bags straight to your door.

British Airways passengers arriving from Edinburgh and Glasgow can now head directly to their meetings, knowing their luggage will be collected for them and delivered within hours to a London address.

The airline has teamed up with AirPortr, a new premium luggage concierge service at London City to deliver a new service known as ‘Carousel Collection’ to its Executive Club members. 

Land and leave: A new service at London City airport will let passengers touch down and head out the door

Chris Nash, British Airways’ customer experience manager for London City Airport, said: 'Many business travellers choose to fly with us from Edinburgh and Glasgow into London City thanks to its location so close to the corporate heart of the Capital.

'They’ve told us their priority when they land is to head straight to the office so we’ve launched this service with AirPortr to enable them to do just that without worrying about any luggage they’ve checked in.

'We’re trialling it on these two routes but hope to roll the service out to other destinations that we serve from London City in the future.'

Trial run: The service is currently only available on flights from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London City

Luggage is securely tagged and GPS tracked in real-time, and customers receive text or email updates on their bags' whereabouts.

The normal ‘Carousel Collection’ collection fee of £10 is waived for all Executive Club customers during the first three months.

British Airways is offering those loyalty scheme members a further 10 per cent off the standard AirPortr delivery charges which start at £15 within Canary Wharf and the Docklands, £25 within central London and £35 to outer London. 

Convenience: For most business travellers, their priority when they land is to head straight to the office

Customers wishing to take advantage of the new service can pre-book up to their flight’s departure time. There is also an AirPortr Concierge desk at London City airport.

AirPortr prides itself on a 100 per cent perfect delivery record and security is of paramount importance to them.

British Airways will fly to 23 domestic and European destinations from London City Airport this winter, as well as operating a 32-seater business class only jet to New York, which allows customers to clear US immigration in Ireland and arrive in America as a domestic passenger.
