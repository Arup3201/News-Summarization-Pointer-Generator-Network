As many women know only too well, finding a dress that fits like a glove is no easy task.

But a new dress, created using a 3D printer, may be the answer to every woman's style woes.

A design studio have used 3D printing technology to create an innovative dress customised to a woman’s body.

High tech fashion: A design studio have used 3D printing technology to create an innovative dress customised to a woman's body - but making the garment takes 48 hours and costs £1,900

The dress, which costs a staggering £1,900 ($3,000) to print, features 2,279 printed panels interconnected by 3,316 hinges.

Creators Nervous System call it a ‘4D dress’ as, like fabric, the printed garment can go from a compressed object to its intended shape.

Jessica Rosenkrantz, co-founder and creative director, revealed the garment took approximately 48 hours to print.

Future of fashion? The dress features 2,279 printed panels interconnected by 3,316 hinges and the printed garment can go from a compressed object to its intended shape

Lengthy process: The dress is printed using a process called Selective Laser Sintering that uses a laser to fuse together nylon powder, leaving unmelted powder in between all of the gap spaces

The company, based in Massachusetts, USA, have also created a smartphone and tablet app, which helps users to manipulate their dresses.

Using the app, the pattern, style and flexibility of the dress can all be changed.

Speaking about her work, Jessica said: 'I’m very interested in a future where garments are more personal and customised.

'It is printed using a process called Selective Laser Sintering that uses a laser to fuse together nylon powder, leaving unmelted powder in between all of the gap spaces.

'This extra powder falls away after printing which is what allows us to print complex interlocking mechanisms that work right out of the printer.

'Body scanning and new design and fabrication techniques are opening up more possibilities in this direction.

'More dresses are already on the way.'

Time-consuming:  Body scanning and new design and fabrication techniques are opening up more possibilities in this direction, say founders, who believe this is the future of fashion 

Forward-thinking: The company have also created a smartphone and tablet app, which helps users to manipulate their dresses. Using the app, the pattern, style and flexibility of the dress can all be changed
