Weapon: Widow Patricia Elkin, 82, armed herself with a wooden truncheon

An 82-year-old woman wrong-footed her 84-year old next door neighbour when they came to blows during a violent showdown outside their seaside bungalows, a court heard.

Widow Patricia Elkin, 82, armed herself with a wooden truncheon and confronted Peter Harper as he brandished a tree branch after a late night bust up.

During the ensuing scuffle, retired accountant Mr Harper fell and claimed he was beaten by his elderly neighbour as he lay on the floor and he had to be taken to hospital with a head wound.

A court heard the elderly neighbours were locked in a long running feud lasting 12 years but Mrs Elkin was a 'no nonsense' woman who 'would not be intimidated.'

Today she showed no emotion as she admitted affray but was spared a jail term after a judge was told the warring pair had now called a truce.

Preston Crown Court was told the row was the climax of a long running fall out in which police had previously been called out to reports of trouble at the pensioners’ £150,000 properties in Thornton Cleveleys, near Blackpool, Lancashire.

Miss Claire Thomas prosecuting said on the evening of April 18th last year at 11.30pm Mr Harper was getting ready for bed when his security light at the front of the property came on.

Miss Thomas added: 'He looked out and saw the defendant standing on the street opposite the address.

'He didn’t know what she was doing so he went to confront her and decided to arm himself with a tree branch in case he needed to defend himself.

'He went outside and shouted something to the defendant. She walked back into her property and took a wooden truncheon which she keeps by the front door and went back outside and a confrontation took place between the two. Both of them were armed.

'There was confrontation and Mr Harper fell to the floor and was struck while he was on the floor. Both Mrs Elkin and Mr Harper each say that the other struck the first blow. Mr Harper fell to the floor and was hit by Mrs Elkin when he was on the floor.

'The police were called and she was arrested and was interviewed and said that her security light had come on. In the interview she said she went and got the truncheon for her defence and she accepts that.'

Mrs Elkin originally faced an allegation of wounding Mr Harper with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but the charge was reduced to threatening unlawful violence.

At war: The £150,000 bungalows in Linden Avenue, Thornton Cleveleys belonging to Patricia Elkin and Peter Holden. The incident took place outside in the street

One character reference read to the court said: 'She would not be intimidated and will protect her possessions if needs be. She was acting in self-defence.

'She will not stand any nonsense and she should have the right to enjoy her final years in peace. At the very least she can stand up for herself.'

In mitigation defence counsel Chris Hudson: 'For the last 12 years Mrs Elkin who is fiercely independent has been blighted by this neighbour.

'In relation to the incident, it is a tragedy for both sides. Mr Harper has had a most unfortunate injury and ended up being taken to hospital and the defendant had the unpleasant experience of going to court on numerous occasions.

Mr Harper's wife Imelda said today: 'It was a full moon that night and she’s always odd when there’s a full moon.'

'She has been back at the property and subject to a curfew from 7am until 7pm. She is a keen ballroom dancer and she has not been able to attend. She has lost her good character and she is going to be in the newspaper which is a shame for her.

'The court needs to be assured that this will not happen again.'

He added: 'It looks as though there was as scuffle and the police were called to try and calm down the situation.

'The neighbours’ dispute, in my opinion, has been fuelled by both sides and I don’t wish to criticise Mr Harper but he should not have gone out.'

'Mrs Elkin was outside her own property on the far side of the road. He should never have armed himself with a weapon and he should never have gone outside.

'It took place by Mrs Elkin’s own front gate. All she needed to do was shut and lock the door. The consequences were unpleasant for both sides.

'Mrs Elkin has had 14 months time elapse, if anything was likely to spark a repetition it would have happened.

'They have managed to maintain a truce and she doesn’t want any repetition.'

Mrs Elkin was ordered to complete a two year community order with a supervision requirement and was ordered to pay £500 costs.

Passing sentence Judge Robert Altham said: 'There is a background of animosity between you both.

'On the night in question your neighbour, the complainant, saw his security light come on and saw you were standing on the street opposite his address and decided to go out and confront you and armed himself with a branch which he took from the side of the house.

'He shouted at you and you returned to your house to pick up a wooden truncheon you kept behind your front door and went back outside.

‘It was plainly wrong and it was wrong to take that wooden truncheon outside your house to meet with the complainant.

'It was a decision which you should not have taken. You should not have taken that step or gone back out onto the street. What happened after was an extremely unpleasant incident and the complainant suffered extremely unpleasant injuries thereafter.

'You do not bear criminal responsibility for this and the Crown could not say how these injuries were sustained. The criminal responsibility is taking the truncheon out into the street.

'You are 82 and are not just of a good character but of an exemplary character. You have worked all your working life and moved to the area after you lost your husband.

'You are someone who is kind, caring and considerate. Surrounding yourself by people who think that you have done nothing wrong, that is unhelpful position to place yourself in.

'You need to accept that whatever the rights or wrongs, taking a weapon out onto the street could not be justified.'

Mr Harper's wife Imelda said today: 'It was a full moon that night and she’s always odd when there’s a full moon.'

Speaking at her home, the former nurse, 78, said: 'That woman knows how to push Peter’s buttons.'
