America now has more computers, smartphones, tablets and gaming consoles that connect to the internet than it does people, a new report has found.

At the last census there were 311.5 million people living in the United States, but we now have more than 425 million gadgets that we use to surf the web.

Laptop and desktop computers remain the primary way for Americans to go online when they're at home, but smartphones and tablets are 'diminishing the computer's relevance' to the internet.

According to market research firm NPD Group, gadgets with smaller screens such as iPhones have the greatest reach now with an estimated 133 million users.

Tablet computers are growing in importance, contributing another 31.8 million internet accessible screens to the tally, according to the report.

Many Americans have a growing appetite for screen-sharing - streaming a movie or photos from your smartphone or tablet to the TV.

But using the TV itself as an 
internet device hasn't really caught on although manufacturers see this 
as a growth market, particularly if new products simple for consumers to
understand.

'Mobile is adding another dimension powered by screen sharing technologies that allows users to project their tablet or smartphone onto their TV,' said John Buffone, author of the report.

'Through 2013, multi-screen and multi-device synergy will lead the growth in the broader connected device market, but only if services consumers desire are delivered in a simplistic manner.

'In this connected world, content providers need to determine the optimal mix of services and have them on the right devices.'

The NPD Group surveyed more than 4,000 U.S. consumers over age 18 in the fourth quarter of 2012 for its report.

The internet connected devices included computers, tablets, smartphones, HDTVs, Blu-ray Disc Players, video game consoles, and streaming media set top boxes.

Routers, modems mobile hot spots and pay TV set-top boxes were not included as internet-connected products, nor were e-readers like Kindle because of the 'limited content' they offer in terms of a true internet device.
