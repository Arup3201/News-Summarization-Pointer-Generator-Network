He mowed the grass and tended the estate for nearly 20 years.

But all those lawnmowers, strimmers and chainsaws took their toll on Clifford Sayers, it was claimed yesterday.

The 65-year-old gardener believes he was deafened by the din from the power tools. And now he is suing the 90-year-old baroness who employed him.

In a £25,000 compensation battle, Mr Sayers is seeking damages for ‘noise induced deafness’ he says he suffered while looking after the East Sussex estate, home to Pia, Lady Chelwood, widow of Military Cross holder and former Tory MP Tufton Beamish.

Yesterday a court heard that when he complained to her about the ringing in his ears ‘her response was that she would get similar symptoms when loading her husband’s guns’.

The case of the gardener, the war hero and the baroness emerged at the Appeal Court in London as lawyers argued over whether Mr Sayers had been denied a full hearing of his claim, which the baroness is contesting.

Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, widowed Lady Chelwood said she felt betrayed by her former gardener.

She said: ‘I’m furious that he has repaid our generosity and kindness with this legal action.‘He came to us in 1981. He was a truck driver and answered my husband’s advertisement for a gardener in the local paper.

‘He knew nothing about gardening but my husband was very kind to him, helped him to learn and we gave him the lodge for him and his sick wife to live in.

‘We paid for all his utility bills, heating, expenses, and a good wage. We looked after him and his family.

‘But when my husband died in 1989 I expected him to look after me and he did nothing. He was terribly lazy and never did the work properly, or weeded my vegetable garden when it was too much for me.’

Lady Chelwood said that after Mr Sayers’ wife died she asked him to leave the lodge.

She added: ‘He was totally physically fit, with no hearing problems, when he left here in 2000, and I gave him three months’ notice pay and a six thousand pounds redundancy.

‘I feel so betrayed. This case has been thrown out so many times now it’s ridiculous.’

Lady Chelwood added that ear protectors, as well as protective clothing, boots and waterproofs were provided for Mr Sayers by her and her husband.

Baron Chelwood, formerly Colonel Sir Tufton Victor Hamilton Beamish, took on Mr Sayers as a gardener and forester in 1981.

The outspoken backbencher, wounded during glittering war service at Dunkirk and in Italy, stepped down as MP for Lewes and retired from politics in 1974, when he was made a life peer.

Although he listed gardening among his hobbies, he needed someone to look after the grounds of his country home, set in the East Sussex countryside above the South Downs.

Lord Chelwood – long satirised by Private Eye as Sir Bufton-Tufton – was a staunch champion of the countryside and a keen ornithologist.  

The court heard Mr Sayers worked for him until his death in 1989, then for Austrian born Pia. He is understood to have lived in the lodge until he left in 2000.

Duties also included tending pheasants and feeding the ponies. But it was using the mechanical tools, Mr Sayers alleges, that caused the ‘intrusive’ ringing in his ears.

He claims he had a 45 per cent reduction in his overall hearing and suffered from what was described as ‘an irreparable industrial disease’.

However, he was told in 2005 that his hearing loss could be age related.

Three Appeal Court judges reserved their decision on Mr Sayers’ appeal until a later date.

Last night he declined to comment on the case.
