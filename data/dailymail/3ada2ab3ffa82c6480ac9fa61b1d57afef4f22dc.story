Weeping openly and with pain etched into her face, this picture shows the toll the expenses scandal has taken on former Labour MP Margaret Moran.

The 56-year-old was pictured leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier today with a handkerchief to her nose after an appearance in relation to her expenses.

The former member for Luton South cried yesterday as she appeared in court charged with fraudulently claiming £80,000 in expenses.

Showing the strain: Margaret Moran cried as she left court after hearing charges regarding her expenses. Right, the ex-MP during her time at Westminster

She is alleged to have claimed £22,500 to treat dry rot at a home in Southampton, more than 100 miles from her constituency.

She is also is said to have 
repeatedly ‘flipped’ her designated second home, making claims for 
properties in London, Luton and Southampton over four years.

Moran, who stood down at last year’s 
general election, is also said to have  dishonestly claimed £4,756 for 
replacement kitchen units and £14,805 for emergency heating and 
conservatory repairs.

She faces 15 charges of false 
accounting and six of using a false instrument, which relate to her 
allegedly submitting forged invoices, between November 2004 and August 
2008.

Moran, who appeared to have aged 
considerably since the expenses scandal broke, wept in the dock as she 
appeared at City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court for the brief 
hearing.

Too much: Ms Moran was escorted from the court by two men after hearing she faces 15 charges of false accounting and six of using a false instrument

Dressed in a black suit and 
accompanied by husband Michael Booker, who watched proceedings from the 
well of the court, she spoke only to  confirm her name and did not enter
a plea.

Prosecutor Louis Mabley asked for the
case to be sent to crown court because of ‘the nature of the charges, 
their complexity and the value of the sums involved’.

District Judge Daphne Wickham 
released Moran, who lives in Southampton, on unconditional bail. She 
will appear at Southwark Crown Court on October 28 for a plea and case 
management hearing.

The other charges she faces include 
dishonestly claiming £575.78 for a washing machine, fridge and kettle 
for her home in Southampton, a £2,678.76 bill for a  carpet and £527.20 
for a bed.

Wheels of justice: Moran's case was heard at City of Westminster Magistrates Court

She is also accused of claiming 
£2,350 for gardening works at her second home, allegedly forging an 
invoice to the Parliamentary expenses office.

Moran is the fifth Labour MP to face 
prosecution over the expenses scandal. Director of Public Prosecutions 
Keir Starmer has said she will be the last to stand trial.

David Chaytor, Eric Illsley, Elliot Morley and Jim Devine were all jailed and have since been released.

From the House of Lords, Lord Taylor 
of Warwick and Lord Hanningfield – both Tories – were also jailed over 
the expenses scandal.
