New Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is regarded as a true man of the people, a world away from Greece's political elite which has been characterised by corruption.

With the help of his youthful good looks and down-to-earth nature (he happily takes out the rubbish), he has swept to power on a promise to smash the EU's grip on the country's economy.

Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras greets supporters following his victory in the election in Athens

His anti-austerity, left-wing Syriza party swept to victory in the Greek general election - sparking fears of renewed chaos in the euro zone.

He has pledged to renegotiate Greece's €240billion bailout deal - and reverse many of the reforms that EU creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010.

That has placed the country on a collision course with Germany over its massive bailout deal, with Angela Merkel effectively saying the new Greek government can forget any kind of debt relief.  

The win has been hailed by left and right-wing parties across Europe - led by Spain's Podemos, which is vowing a similar general election win this year. 

The 40-year-old was sworn in this afternoon, making him the youngest Greek Prime Minister for more than 150 years. 

Tsipras - characteristically without a tie - also broke with tradition by taking a civil instead of a religious oath, pledging to 'always serve the interests of the Greek people'. 

Shunning the stereotype of Greek politics, Mr Tsipras is known for his relaxed attitude: travelling around Athens on motorbikes and preferring open-necked shirts to a suit and tie.

He lives with his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, with their two boys - Phoebus and Orpheus - in an apartment block in Kypseli, a modest, working-class area of Athens.

Their youngest son's middle name is Ernesto – a tribute to Che Guevara, one of Mr Tsipras's idols. 

He had never been that interested in politics, instead throwing his energy into sport at a young age until he was sidelined with a knee injury. 

But after meeting Ms Batziana, something of a firebrand student, in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens, she convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990.

A year later, the pair found themselves at the centre of student protests against unpopular education reforms.

At the tender age of 17, he was spearheading sit-in demonstrations at their school that saw students living and sleeping in the building for weeks.

Ms Batzianas was right by his side then - and still is now - with many seeing her as the driving force behind her partner's leadership.  

According to friends from the University of Patras, where she graduated in electrical engineering, she is strong-willed, militant and dynamic.

The supporters were told: 'Our priority from tomorrow will be to restore popular sovereignty in the country, to give justice, to clash with old establishments. To clash with the regime of corruption. To promote reforms in the state, public administration, everywhere'

She once hauled one of her professors to court when he tried undermine her work on a doctoral thesis, it was reported by the Greek Reporter.

She also hates spending hours shopping, doesn't like going for regular trips to the hairdressers and won't spend money on clothes.  

Supporter Eleni Sarli, 54, told The Times: 'He is the good guy everybody wants to be and the honest politician everyone wants to trust.' 

After training as an engineer, Mr Tsipras eventually went into politics full-time.

He was a member of the youth wing of the Greek Communist Party, the KKE, rising to prominence as candidate for the mayor of Athens in 2006. 

Tsipras became leader of Syriza in 2008 at the age of 34 at the height of Greece's economic crisis.

Syriza was formed in 2004 as a coalition of moderate Communists, Trotskyists, ecologists and other leftist groups, but has occasionally found it difficult to present a united front.

He has also become the undisputed star of the radical European left, standing against Jean-Claude Juncker in May's election for European Commission president. 

After his general election victory last night, Mr Tsipras told a rally of thousands of supporters he would defeat 'austerity which destroys our common European future', his speech backed by the booming sounds of Rock the Casbah by The Clash. 

He said: 'I would like to reassure you that the new Greek government will be ready to co-operate and negotiate for the first time with our partners for a mutually beneficial and sustainable solution so Greece comes out of a vicious circle of debt.

'We have a great opportunity for a new beginning both in Greece and in Europe. For a new policy, for a new model of relations based on mutual respect.'
