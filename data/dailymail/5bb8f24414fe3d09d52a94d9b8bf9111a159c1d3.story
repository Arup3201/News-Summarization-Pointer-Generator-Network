A mother who stole over £76,000 from her employers after becoming addicted to online bingo has been jailed for 16 months.

Lucienne Mainey became addicted to online gambling after her marriage collapsed, a court heard yesterday.

A trusted member of staff, the 41-year-old began stealing money from the company as her addiction got worse.

Mainey was an accounts administrator for APD Ltd, which makes electrical control panels.

She had been known to the family which ran the company in Newmarket, Suffolk, for 20 years and was a trusted employee, said Michael Crimp, prosecuting.

In January 2011 it emerged Mainey had paid £800 into her account.

She apologised, vowed it would not happen again and repaid the money, said Mr Crimp.

But just eight weeks later Mainey was found playing online bingo at work and given a warning.

In October last year she was quizzed about a £3,000 payment to a supplier and admitted she had paid that sum of money to herself, said Mr Crimp.

A review of the company's accounts revealed she had stolen £76,081 over a year.

Mr Crimp said the actual loss was nearer £87,000 as it had to repay VAT it had claimed.

Jailed: Mainey admitted five offences of fraud by false representation with 25 offences taken into consideration at Ipswich Crown Court

Mainey, of Duxford, Cambridgeshire, admitted five offences of fraud by false representation with 25 offences taken into consideration at Ipswich Crown Court.

Jailing her for 16 months, Judge Peter Fenn said: 'The message must go out loud and clear from this court to those who might succumb to temptation to steal from those whose money they are in a position of managing.'

Judge Fenn said she had committed a gross breach of trust.

Ian James, defending, said Mainey knew she had betrayed the trust placed in her.

Mr James said: 'She has repeatedly expressed her remorse which does genuinely extend beyond her own predicament and extends to the harm she had caused to her employers and their business.'

He said her marriage ended in April 2007 after her husband had an affair with one of her friends.

Mainey turned to online gambling and became addicted to internet bingo. 'It proved to be an extremely expensive pastime,' said Mr James.
