Ecstatic crowds cheered the Queen's carriage procession through the streets of London today as Camilla was given pride of place next to Her Majesty in a very public display of how Prince Charles' wife is now part of the Firm.

The Queen was joined in her 1902 State Landau by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, as the Duke of Edinburgh is being treated in hospital for a bladder infection.

Camilla, once derided by Princess Diana as 'that other woman', has been slowly winning the hearts of the public after years on the sidelines. But today's display of her seniority in the Royal Family leaves nobody in doubt that the Queen has taken her into her confidence.

Friends:  The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall travel together to Buckingham Palace. This year it was 
announced that Camilla is to become a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal 
Victorian Order to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince
 Charles

Camilla's prominence in today's procession is in stark contrast to a decade ago, when she sat distanced from Prince Charles and the senior royals to watch the show marking the Golden Jubilee.

Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles
 married on April 9, 2005, in a civil ceremony at the Guildhall in 
Windsor after their controversial relationship spanning several decades.

As a divorcee, previously married to Andrew Parker Bowles, Camilla was 
disliked by the public and the Royal family as the woman suspected of diverting Charles’s 
affections from Diana.

But after his divorce, Charles made it clear that his relationship with 
Camilla was ‘non-negotiable’ and slowly brought her into the royal 
circle through a series of carefully organised public appearances.

This eventually led to her sitting in
 the royal box behind the Queen for
 one of the Golden Jubilee concerts at Buckingham Palace in 2002.

However, it was still viewed as a dramatic gesture signalling an end to years of bitterness, between herself and the Queen.

For Camilla - whose name the Queen once refused to have mentioned in her presence - the invitation to a televised event was something of a breakthrough and friends at the time said she was 'extremely nervous' at her first step into the limelight.

The apparent ending of any lingering family opposition to her was also hastened by the death of the Queen Mother on March 30 2002.

Recently, she has provided valuable support to the new Duchess of 
Cambridge, who has turned to her for advice on entering royal life. Camilla was spotted at a London hotel last year advising the then Kate Middleton on her upcoming wedding to Prince William.

And, earlier this year, it was 
announced that Camilla is to become a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal 
Victorian Order to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince
 Charles.

All change: Camilla took her place on the front row of the Royal Box as she watched the Diamond Jubilee concert last night showing just how far she's come in 10 years

Meanwhile, Prince Philip is said to be 
'disappointed' at missing the festivities marking the end of the 
extended Diamond Jubilee Bank Holiday.

During this afternoon's procession 
the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry travelled to 
Buckingham Palace behind the Queen in another State Landau, waving at 
cheering crowds.

A 60-gun 
salute by the King's Troop could be heard in front of the Palace, and 
the Queen's Guard awaited her arrival in the palace forecourt.

As the carriage swept in to rapturous applause, the band of the Irish Guards played the national anthem.

All the Royals had all enjoyed lunch 
with members of the City of London Livery Companies in Westminster Hall 
before the spectacle began.

As the carriages emerged from New 
Palace Yard, near Westminster Hall, spectators began cheering and 
applauding the 86-year-old Queen.

Big Ben - the Palace of Westminster's
 Clock Tower - stood behind them and a campaign is under way to rename 
it the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Diamond Jubilee.

The Queen returned to Buckingham Palace this afternoon after enjoying the opulent lunch-time banquet seated amongst tradesmen from gun-makers and grocers to fruiterers and fishmongers.

A euphoric fanfare guided her as she arrived at her Diamond Jubilee lunch hosted by the livery.

Adoring crowds lined the streets ten-deep, waving and cheering, as the monarch travelled to the lunch as trumpeters played with pride.

Some 700 guests representing the companies’ abundant trades and professions greeted the monarch and joined her to dine on a menu of salmon, crab and lamb.

Master Mercer Thomas Sheldon welcomed the Queen, praising her 'unstinting' devotion to duty.

'Much has changed in the last six decades. But it has been the age of Elizabeth,' he told the guests.

'You embody the very best of our national values. You are our constant in a changing world.'

Mr Sheldon added: 'We are 
particularly sorry that the Duke of Edinburgh is unwell and cannot be 
with us but we all wish him a speedy recovery.'

The start of the banquet was signalled with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, saying Grace.

The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are also attending the meal.

William has been placed at the Engineers and Arbitrators table, while Kate was joined by the Master Glovers and Pattenmakers.

The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers
 was founded in the 17th century as a trade association for the makers 
of pattens - under-shoes of wood and metal which were worn strapped 
beneath the shoes to raise the wearer out of the mud on the streets.

The Company now draws its membership 
from the City of London and the Footwear industry, with its main focus 
being charitable works.

The Worshipful Company of Glovers was formed in 1349 by glove makers in London to protect their craft.

Harry is on the Fruiterers and Gardeners table.

Among the vast range of participating 
Livery companies are the Worshipful Companies of Goldsmiths, Butchers, 
Innholders, Weavers, Distillers, Clockmakers and even Tax Advisers.

Guests are dining on marinated Uist 
Island salmon with Lyme Bay crab, followed by saddle of Welsh Cambrian 
Mountain lamb with braised shoulder of lamb, grilled Isle of Wight 
asparagus, Jersey Royal potatoes and an aptly named Jubilee sauce.

The 'symphony of dessert' is chocolate delice, bread and butter pudding and berry compote with Sandringham apple sauce

A Ceylon tea will also be served made 
from a bush planted by the Duke of Edinburgh during a state visit to Sri
 Lanka in 1954 in the Pedro Tea Plantation in Nuwara Eliya.

The National Children’s Orchestra of Great Britain are also to perform during the event.

The loyal toast will be proposed by the Lord Speaker Baroness D’Souza.

The Livery Companies of the City of 
London originated in medieval times as Guilds responsible for trade 
regulation, including checking the quality of goods, weights and 
measures and training.

Today the companies use their funds to undertake charitable and community work.

Before the lunch the Queen attended a reception at Mansion House.
