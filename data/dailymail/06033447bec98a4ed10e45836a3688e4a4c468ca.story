Wealthy: The Duke of Northumberland has been accused by farmers on his estate-owned land of a 'get rich quick' attitude, after claiming they were hit by rent hikes of up to 98 per cent

He is the aristocratic owner of the castle featured in Harry Potter.

And although his fortune is said to be around £320million, it seems the Duke of Northumberland wants more.

Ralph Percy, 56, has been accused of wrecking the livelihoods of tenant farmers after his land agents demanded massive rent increases.Some have been asked to pay up to 98 per cent more or face eviction.

The Duke, whose son George was last year rumoured to be dating Pippa Middleton, owns some 132,000 acres of land.

His 1,000-year-old castle at Alnwick, which featured as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films, is known as the Windsor of the North.

But despite his wealth, it emerged yesterday that the Duke’s Estate is conducting a crippling round of rent reviews on its farmers in Northumberland.

There is no legal limit to the rent  the land agents can ask for, and tenants are unlikely to challenge them because this can end up costing them even more. 

With many farmers suffering from a slump in lamb prices, some fear they might have to give up their properties altogether.

Stoker Frater, who runs two farms on land near Alnwick, has been told to expect a 40 per cent increase, following on from a 30 per cent rise three years ago.

He said: ‘Tenants are expected to pay outlandish rents just to get the land.

‘The Estate has become so business-orientated that it will take the highest offer.’

Another, who also farms near Alnwick but did not want to be named, was told his annual rent was due to go up by 98 per cent this year.

Grand: Alnwick Castle, the residency of the Duke of Northumberland, which was also used as a location in the Harry Potter films

After saying he could not afford it, 
he was told to accept a 64 per cent rise or be off the land by the 
following month. He said: ‘My rent will go up from £21,000 a year to 
£34,000, which is completely unachievable.

‘This is affecting my entire family as I won’t be able to afford to run the farm if my rent goes up by this much.’

Northumberland Estates, which has 
land in the West Country and Yorkshire as well as Northumberland, has 
about 100 tenanted farms. It said the rent reviews reflected rises in 
market rates.

But David Robson, of the NFU in Northumberland, said the Estate was taking advantage of its tenants.

He said: ‘It seems the Estate is 
wanting its pound of flesh. Historically, they were run more on the 
traditional basis where a farmer was actively encouraged to look after 
the land. Now if the farmer can’t pay he’s out the door.’

The rises come as the Duke prepares 
for a multi-million pound bill linked to the demolition of flood-hit 
flats in Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne, although the Estate says the 
issues are not linked.

Tenants have the right to call in an 
arbitrator if they dispute a rent rise, but can end up paying costs of 
up to £40,000 if the ruling is in the landlord’s favour.

An Estate spokesman said: ‘We 
understand tenants do not welcome potential increases in rent but 
believe that, by encouraging open and honest discussions during 
negotiations, rent reviews take into account the type of tenancy, the 
individual farm and rents accurately reflect market conditions.’
