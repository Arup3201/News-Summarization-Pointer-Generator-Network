Britain is bracing itself for a lashing from the elements when the driest month on record is set to be blown away by 70mph winds and heavy rain this weekend.

But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South.

The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days.

Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning

Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September 

This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts 

Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding

Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. 

The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910.

It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers.

The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert.

The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.'

A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning.

Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours.

Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was  spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young

Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of

Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch

The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.'

It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. 

Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding.

Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow 

Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return

Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather

Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of "change of month, change of weather". 

'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas.

'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. 

Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning

Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end

'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges.

'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late.

'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.'
