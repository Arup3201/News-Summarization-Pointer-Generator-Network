'Highly regarded': Sir David Higgins, who was knighted in 2011, is likely to walk away from Railtrack with a severance pay and bonus pot of £1million

The Network Rail boss at the centre of bitter rows over fat cat executive bonuses, poor punctuality and overcrowded trains is to quit.

Chief executive Sir David Higgins intends to leave next year, and is likely to walk away with a severance pay and bonus pot worth up to £1million.

Senior Whitehall sources insist he was not ‘pushed’ and stressed that Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was disappointed  at the departure of the ‘highly regarded’ boss.

However, union sources hinted at internal squabbles suggesting that Sir David had simply ‘had enough’ with the politics and constant  public rows over large bonuses and poor performance of the railways.

Last week the Daily Mail revealed how Sir David, who was knighted in 2011, and four other Network Rail directors could be paid more than £11million over the next three years – £5million of it in bonuses if they meet performance targets.

Unions condemned the potential pay-outs as ‘rewards for failure’.

Sir David, 58, who has served as chief executive since February 2011, is planning to step down within a year.

Taxpayer-funded Network Rail declined to specify the terms of his contract, though rail experts said departing bosses stand to pick up between six months and a year’s salary.

Network Rail missed all of its passenger train punctuality targets in 2012-13 and has been warned by watchdogs that it is steaming towards a £75million fine by spring next year over fears it will miss future punctuality targets for long-distance services. Its debts have also soared to £30 billion.

Sir David’s package currently includes annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of his £577,000 a year salary, or £346,200 a year.

He also stands to make up to 100 per cent of his £577,000 annual salary under a long-term incentive plan which pays out in April 2015, however Network Rail said he would relinquish that element of any pay out if he does leave before that date.

Last year, following political pressure, rail bosses, including Sir David, waived their six-figure bonus packages and instead allocated them to a safety programme.

Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones had asked Sir David to stay in post for the bulk of the next five year funding period, but he declined.

Sir David then agreed with the board that he would make way for a successor as part of ‘an entirely amicable departure,’ said sources.

Sir David originally joined the Network Rail board as a non-executive director in April 2010, after running the body responsible for preparing for the London Olympics.

Network Rail was created by Labour in 2002 after it pulled the plug on private sector Railtrack. 

The not for dividend company, which has 'members' instead of shareholders receives £3.5billion taxpayer subsidy a year, which represents just over half its total income, with the rest from fare-payers or borrowings.

Its current five year budget is £35billion, or £7billion a year. It is seeking from the Government a budget of £37billion for its next five year period.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union hinted last night at internal tensions saying Sir David ‘had done a good job in difficult circumstances’ and would be ‘a hard act to follow.’

Mr Cortes said: ‘Sir David Higgins has done a good job in turning Network Rail around after the difficulties experienced under the previous regime.

'He removed its bullying culture and placed a new emphasis on safety which had been sadly lacking. He was not afraid to take on the “old guard” who wanted things to remain the same.

‘He was slowly restoring the company’s reputation and we would have liked him to stay around to finish the job he had started.’
