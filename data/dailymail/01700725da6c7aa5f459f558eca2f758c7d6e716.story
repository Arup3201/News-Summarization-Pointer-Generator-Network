Thankfully for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the days are gone when a waxwork bore only a passing resemblance to its subject.

Madame Tussauds in London yesterday unveiled its figures of Kate and William as the new star attraction in its royal section.

And visitors were captivated by their accuracy – made even more remarkable by the fact that artists worked purely from photographs and videos of the couple, who were too busy to attend apersonal sitting.

Uncanny: Madame Tussauds unveil their new statues of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The waxwork is Kate's first

The Tussauds artists worked from the iconic pose of the two at the announcement of their 
engagement, when Kate wore the now famous blue dress to match the 
stunning sapphire engagement ring, once Diana's, that she had just been 
given by her prince.

Daniella Helayel of Issa, the design 
house behind the original dress, created an exact replica of the garment
especially for the team at Tussauds.

Prince William is in a replica of the Gieves and Hawkes navy two piece single breasted suit recreated by the renowned tailors. 

Catherine’s figure wears on her hand an accurate recreation of her sapphire and diamond engagement ring, while William wears a replica of the Omega Seamaster watch he wore on his engagement day.

Tussauds revealed that the couple 
were kept closely informed of work on the figures at every stage of the 
creation, a process continuing a relationship with the Royal family that
goes back 180 years, when Madame Tussaud opened her first attraction in
London featuring the figure of King William IV.  

The figures cost £150,000 each to make and took a dedicate team of artists four months to create.

Situated nearby are Her Majesty The 
Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess 
of Cornwall, as well as Princess Harry and the late Princess Diana.

'We are delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess to Madame Tussauds London,' commented Liz Edwards, PR Manager at Madame Tussauds London. 

'They are one of the most famous and best loved couples in the World and Catherine has rapidly become one of the most stylish women on the international stage.  

'We know our guests are going to relish the opportunity to get up close to them and join them in celebrating their first wedding anniversary later this month.'

Visitors are expected to pour through 
the doors in their droves to catch a glimpse of the new statues, with 
queues already forming outside the Baker St. attraction.

The unveiling of the statues in the UK coincides with a launch of two further Kate and William waxworks, at Madame Tussauds in Amsterdam and New York.

In the U.S, Tussauds, Kate will be 
wearing the pale lavender floor-length Alexander McQueen gown she wore 
at the Bafta Brits To Watch event in London, while William will be 
dressed in a tuxedo. 

In Amsterdam, Kate is immortalised 
wearing the black lace Temperley London gown she wore for her recent red
carpet appearance at the War Horse premiere.

A fourth attraction, Madame Tussauds 
Blackpool, will include the figures later this month and will show 
Catherine in a replica of the Jenny Packham dress from her appearance at
the ARK Charity Dinner, again created in collaboration with the 
designer.
