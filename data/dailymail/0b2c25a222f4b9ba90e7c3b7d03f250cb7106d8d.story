The sharp AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S2 will be upgraded to a 720p hi-def screen capable of 3D visuals, and able to plug into a TV to play 3D content, according to Korean reports

Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S3 handset is set to 'go 3D', according to leaks from the company's native Korea.

The handset could display 3D films and games on its screen, and even plug into 3D televisions to 'play' 3D content such as photos.

The handset is due to launch in February, and will sport hi-tech features such as an AMOLED screen capable of 720p hi def.

The phone will also have 2GB of RAM, said the leak, reported by Korean news site ET News.

Rivals such as LG and HTC already offer 3D handsets - using glasses-free technology to make objects 'leap out' of the screen, and armed with dual-lens 3D cameras.

But the lack of games and videos that use 3D has meant that neither handset has been a huge seller.

Samsung's cult Galaxy handsets are a different matter.

The existence of a Galaxy S3 is an absolute certainty after the runaway success of Samsung's Galaxy S2, which sold 10 million units at last count, helping to propel Samsung's smartphone sales past Apple's in the third quarter of 2011. 

The new handset will launch at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona at the end of February.

'Samsung’s Galaxy lineup has been one of the most sought after smartphone lines worldwide,' says Boy Genius Report.

'The Galaxy S II became the company’s fastest selling smartphone ever, selling threemillion units in just 55 days.'

'Moreover, Samsung sold more than 30 million Galaxy S and Galaxy S II smartphones worldwide as of October. There is no question that consumers are interested in the Galaxy.'

Samsung has yet to comment on the reports.
