The compare and contrast makes miserable reading for Real Madrid supporters. Going into the World Club Championship back in December the team was on a run of 21 straight wins. They had scored 79 goals in the process and conceded just ten.

Cristiano Ronaldo had scored 25 goals in the first 15 games of the season with Messi trailing in his wake 12 goals behind. With new signings Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez a huge success Carlo Ancelotti’s only problem was keeping everyone happy as he tried to fit all his stars into the starting XI.

When they beat San Lorenzo to win in Marrakech they were crowned World Club champions and there were few who contested their status as the best team on the planet.

Sport said Real were 'humiliated' against Atletico

Fast forward to the return of Champions League football and they are no longer the favourites to win the competition having been overtaken by Bayern. The team Ancelotti will field in the Veltins Arena against Schalke on Wednesday will be much weaker than the side he was able to pick in December and leading scorer Ronaldo has found the net just three times since the turn of the year.

Even before Christmas Madrid’s coaching staff were concerned about a possible dip at the start of the new year. They knew that the World Club Cup meant two extra fixtures (made three by a winter break friendly against AC Milan). 

Ancelotti and his assistants also knew that there were certain players who were running close to empty having had big World Cup tournaments in the summer and played too many games since. And the fixture calendar had not been kind pairing them with Valencia and three times against Atletico Madrid – twice in the Cup and once away in the league. Real Madrid lost three of those four games.

Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas is back in the supporters' bad books after his slip in the 4-0 defeat by Atletico

In goal Iker Casillas’ mistake for the first goal in 4-0 league defeat to Atletico means he is being whistled again by his own supporters. In front of him the defence is creaking. Without the hamstrung Sergio Ramos there is no one to bring the ball out from the back and with Pepe missing there has been a lack of defensive organisation too. Ancelotti might have to repeat the inexperienced pairing of Nacho and Varane on Tuesday against Schalke although Pepe is racing to get back in time to play the game.

The midfield trio of Kroos, Rodriguez and Luca Modric has been hit by injury with the latter two both missing. At first the absence of the Croatian former Spurs midfielder was not felt too much but with Kroos tiring from having to play every game he has been missed more than ever in the last few games.

Ancelotti has little faith in Asier Illaramendi who the club signed for €30m two years ago from Real Sociedad so winter signing Lucas Silva might have to be pitched in against Schalke.

Up-front Ronaldo’s misfiring has been the biggest cause for concern. He gave Leo Messi an ‘I’m coming for you’ message at the Balon d’Or ceremony at the start of the year but he has only scored four goals in his last 10 games and Messi is now just two goals behind him in the goalscoring charts. So much for the theory that having scored 25 goals in 15 games Ronaldo could finish the season with 70 goals.

On the plus side Real Madrid are in the capable hands of Ancelotti who has steered many a big team through this mid-season crisis. Not that there is much love for him from the Bernabeu where he was booed when his name was read out at the weekend. There is also the plus of the form of Isco who was again outstanding at the weekend in the unconvincing win over Deportivo.

And perhaps most encouragingly for their supporters the precedents from last year in terms of matches between Schalke and Real are very positive. In February 2014 Madrid beat Schalke 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen with the BBC – Bale, Benzema and Crisitano – all scoring twice.

Madrid are on a run of 19 straight wins in the Champions League so another victory will take them to 20. And if it's a big win like last season they will feel a little more comfortable wearing that World Club champions crest on their shirts. The one that seems to have cursed them since the turn of the year.
