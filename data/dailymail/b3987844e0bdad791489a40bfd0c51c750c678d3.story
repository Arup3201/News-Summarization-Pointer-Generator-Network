Britain was hit with torrential downpours today as thunder storms darkened the skies over much of the country.

More than 13mm of rain fell in Nantwich, Cheshire in just over 12 hours over night and into this morning, with 11.2mm in Trawscoed, Dyfed and nearly 9mm at London's Heathrow Airport.

But after a day of storms, forecasters are promising warmer and brighter weather towards the end of the week and into the weekend, with some areas to see temperatures in the mid-twenties.

The west coast of Scotland saw some of the worst of today's storms, with residents in St Andrews, Fife taking a series of amazing photos of dark skies and flashes of lightning.

After capturing a picture of a bolt of lightning striking earth, amateur photographer Kerry Johnstone said: 'It had been really sunny and was actually pretty warm when it just got really dark and rain clouds started coming in. I've always wanted to capture lightning and I was so surprised that I actually got it.'

Heavy showers and downpours affected nearly all parts of the country today. Early-season cricket was affected, with the match between Essex and Sri Lanka in Chelmsford one of a number in which play had to be stopped.

But forecasters say today's wet weather was the worst we will see for a while and temperatures will be above average in most places for the rest of the week.

Met Office spokesman Nicola Maxey said: 'The wet weather will move off to the east this evening, with evening sunshine in the South West. Tomorrow will see the start of some warmer weather, with temperatures reaching the high teens in many areas.

Forecasters say the fluctuating weather today of sun and downpours is the worst we will see for a while

'There will still be some showers in Scotland tomorrow, but the rest of the country will see some patchy cloud and some sunshine. It could reach 20C in parts of the south of England.

'Thursday should be fine and dry, in the low twenties in some areas and on Friday, although there is the chance of the odd shower, temperatures could top 23C around London.'

Leon Brown, chief meteorologist with the Weather Channel, added: 'The weather is improving after today until Saturday as high pressure builds and cuts off the cool north west flow that has been responsible for the unstable and showery weather the past few days.

'Temperatures lifting to 21 to 22C by Friday and Saturday, but get prepared for another much cooler spell again early next week and more showers.'
