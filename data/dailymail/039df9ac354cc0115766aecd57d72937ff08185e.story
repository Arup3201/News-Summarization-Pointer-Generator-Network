Britain is at risk of economic decline as it rapidly turns into a ‘super-aged’ nation, a report claimed yesterday.

The ‘unprecedented’ pace of ageing will slow growth over the next 20 years, according to research by the ratings agency Moody’s.

One in five of the population is predicted to be 65 or over in little more than a decade. 

Moody's used United Nations definitions to examine which countries would be classed as 'super-aged' by 2030. A society is considered to be ‘ageing’ if over-65s make up at least 7 per cent of the population, ‘aged’ when the figure is at least 14 per cent, and when it tops 20 per cent it is considered to be a ‘super-aged’ society

The report warns that countries around the world will see their economies suffer because of a rapidly ageing population

And they will create a ‘demographic tax’ as fewer people of working-age affect levels of production, while the need to support more retired and elderly people will slash the amount of savings available for investment, analysts warned.

They also suggest that immigration – often cited by experts as a way to counter the effects of an ageing population – has only a small or temporary effect.

An influx of foreign workers, although bringing in younger employees and encouraging investment from abroad, could only ‘partially mitigate’ the effects of ageing, said the report. 

The author of the report, Elena Duggar, warned: ‘Demographic transition, frequently considered a long-term problem, is upon us now and will significantly lower economic growth.’

Just 23 countries will be classes as 'not-ageing' by 2030, piling pressure on public services and holding economies back

'It's amazing, really, the spread of grey-haired people in Britain'

By 2025, 
Britain will be among 11 nations expected to be ‘super-aged’.

More than one in five people are 65 and have retired or are approaching 
retirement.

Germany,
 Italy and Japan have already reached that stage, while a further ten – 
including France, the Netherlands and Sweden – will be there by 2020.

There are predicted to be 34 super-aged countries by 2030. 

The report said: ‘Sharp declines in fertility rates and infant mortality and increased life expectancy during the 20th century led to sustained population growth, with the world population increasing four-fold over this period.

‘The same factors are changing the age structure of populations across both developed and developing countries in the 21st century.’

Around six in ten of the countries rated by Moody’s are ageing, with seven per cent of their population aged 65 or more.

However, the problem is not exclusive to developed countries.

Some rapidly growing markets such as Russia and China are also facing the issue.

The report added: ‘Ageing is not just a developed-world problem as is generally believed.

‘Many emerging markets are already classified as ageing.

'Countries like Russia, Thailand, Chile and China have rapidly deteriorating demographics.

'Even relatively young countries such as Brazil and Turkey are ageing.’

Moody’s, which regularly prepares reports for investors and finance firms, said the worst-hit countries will be those with high unemployment and low incomes, such as Greece and Portugal.

It also warned that Asian countries where the population is ageing faster than in well-established industrial countries like Britain will face ‘complex and challenging’ difficulties unknown in the West.

The first countries set to join Germany, Italy and Japan with super-age status will be Finland and Greece – who will be added to the list next year.

The group will grow to 13 in 2020 when they are joined by France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Portugal, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Malta.

When the UK is added to the super-aged set in 2025, it will be accompanied by Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Estonia and Canada.

In 2030, the US, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, Latvia, Serbia, Bosnia Hercegovina and Georgia will complete the group of 34.
