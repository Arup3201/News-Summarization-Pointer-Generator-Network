A 19-year-old student whose neck was impaled by a broken golf club is speaking out about the ordeal for the first time - and has revealed her plans to return to college.

In a show of incredible resilience, Natalie Jo Eaton, from Harrisburg, Arkansas, is walking again five months after the freak accident on her second day of school at Arkansas State University.

Speaking to Fox, she recalled how she was posing for a photo on August 19 when a  student behind her hit a football with his golf club, breaking the club and sending its shaft flying 30ft and into her neck.

'I thought someone had hit me in the head with a baseball bat,' Eaton told My Fox Atlanta.

Fighter: Natalie Jo Eaton, 19, has given her first interview since she was impaled with a golf club in a freak accident at Arkansas State University in August. She remains at a rehab center in Atlanta, Georgia

Incredible: After five months of therapy, Eaton is now able to walk with the help of canes and staff members

She fell to the ground and tried to turn to see what had hit her - but as she looked, the metal in her back scraped across the concrete.

'That's when I knew there was something in my neck,' she recalled.

The club had perforated her spinal cord and a major artery when it pierced her neck.

As she lay on the ground, there was one thought in her mind.

'I just remember [thinking], "If I'm going to die, please just let someone I know be here",' she said.

Fortunately her brother Brody, a recent medical school graduate, was nearby and kept her stable until emergency services arrived.

She was airlifted to a Memphis hospital and three weeks later, she was transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, one of the top rehabilitation hospitals for spinal cord injuries.

Doctors initially thought she would be paralyzed, but she started months of intense physical and occupational therapy, and soon learned how to sit and carry out everyday tasks, such as brushing and straightening her hair.

At first, she said she was overwhelmed by the work but slowly, she began seeing improvements. She is now also able to walk with the help of a frame or canes while a staff member gives her support.

'When you start accomplishing little goals, you're like, "Okay, there's a a light at the end of this tunnel. There's going to be a way that you can overcome this",' she said.

She continues to suffer from weakness on the right side of her body, but is hoping to leave the center by the end of January.

After that, she hopes to start her freshman year again in August, and despite her struggles, she is remaining upbeat. 

'You can look at it the bad way, as why did this happen to me?' she said. 'Or, you can look at it as I'm still alive. I'm still able to get better.'
