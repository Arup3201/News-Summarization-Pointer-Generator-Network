Dozens of videos of teenagers and young people fighting have been posted on a disturbing Facebook page which appears to glorify bare-knuckle bouts.

The site boasts that its clips are meant to 'entertain' web users, while some of those featured in the videos say they treat their vicious fights as a type of 'sport'.

But residents of the areas where the videos were filmed have denounced the 'worrying trend' of public fights which they say are making their streets more dangerous.

A leading MP described the Facebook page as 'very depressing', while the father of a young man killed by a single punch urged the fighters to think again about their actions.

Brawl: This is one of the fights featured on the Facebook page 'Fight Central', which has been taken down after complaints from campaigners

Collection: Dozens of clips of filmed brawls were featured on the site before it was deleted from Facebook

The 'Fight Central' page appeared on Facebook on January 2, and hosted video clips of 43 different fights, ranging from brawls caught on CCTV to incidents of violence filmed on bystanders' mobile phones.

It was taken down earlier today after receiving negative coverage from campaigners and politicians.

Before the page was deleted, it claimed: 'Fight Central is a Facebook page which regularly uploads fights that have been recorded by anyone.

'People can send fights in for us to upload for your entertainment! Please note that we do not encourage the act of fighting without professional or qualified supervision.'

Two of the most popular videos uploaded to the site were filmed in Blackburn, Lancashire, leading residents to speak out against the voyeuristic clips.

Squaring off: A video of two 20-something men fighting in the streets of Blackburn, Lancashire attracted hundreds of views

One video filmed in November last year showed two 16-year-olds fight, surrounded by 50 other teenagers watching.

The brawl was sparked by a Facebook argument, according to one of those involved who admitted that he regularly organises fights because 'it's like sport'.

Another video from Blackburn featured two men in their 20s punching each other in the face, until one falls to the ground and gets kicked in the head.

Duncan Roberts, who lives in the area where the violent clip was filmed, said: 'There is a small group of young men around here that treat bare knuckle fighting as a hobby or a sport.

'It's a worrying trend round here that more young lads are getting into. I suppose they don't have much else - they have no work, no money.'

Another local resident added: 'The video doesn't surprise me at all. I've only lived here for a year and I'd say that half of those weekends I have seen a fight in some form or another on the streets.

'The police presence is pretty poor and not much seems to get done about it.'

Police have investigated the videos, but have not made any arrests.

Blackburn MP Jack Straw, the former Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, said that the film clips were 'very sad'.

He said: 'I just think that this is very depressing and I wonder if the individuals involved realise just how sad they are.

'It's very difficult to control what goes on the internet but this is terrible for residents that see people fighting on their street in broad daylight.'

Dave Rogers, whose son Adam was killed in Blackburn in 2010 after receiving a single punch to the head, also spoke out against the violence.

'It is such an unhealthy development and you have to wonder if these people have really thought about the consequences,' he said. 'The key lesson from Adam's death was that one punch can kill.

'I don't know what can be done about it but I wish that I could tell each of them Adam's story and the potential danger they are getting themselves into.'
