Accident: British doctor Felix Kiernan has died after falling from a mountain in Yosemite National Park

A British doctor has been killed in a rock climbing accident in California.

Felix Joseph Kiernan died after he was struck by a large rock falling from approximately 150ft.

The 28-year-old from north- west London was 600ft up the popular El Capitan route in Yosemite National Park when his climbing partner dislodged the block, measuring about 1ft by 2ft, in a ‘freak accident’.

He was pronounced dead when  search and rescue workers reached him at around 4pm on Sunday.

El Capitan, a 3,000ft granite rock formation in Yosemite Valley, is one of America’s most popular climbing spots.

Mr Kiernan’s parents said he was an experienced climber and had been enjoying a six-month break before he was due to start training to be an oncologist.

His father, Patrick, 60, also a doctor, said: ‘He and his climbing partner Luke were extremely cautious.

'But it was a freak accident.’

His mother said: ‘He is going to be missed so much.

'He was handsome and so much fun. He was a beautiful man.’

The family, including Felix's twin brother Miles, mother Sarah and 
sister Dorcas are thought to have gone to America following the 
tragedy, according to neighbours.

Mr Kiernan is understood to have gone to secondary school at nearby Acland Burghley, along with his twin who is also a doctor.

Mr Kiernan was about 600 feet (180m) up the climbing route when the loose block was dislodged by his climbing partner.

A party climbing just below Mr Kiernan immediately called the Yosemite Emergency Communication Centre and reported the incident.

Park Rangers and Yosemite Search and Rescue workers were sent to El 
Capitan where they began climbing the route to reach the climbers.

Park Rangers reached Mr Kiernan around 4pm and he was pronounced dead.

Speaking to CNN, park ranger Scott 
Gediman said: 'This was a tragic accident. There were two climbers and 
one of the climbers stepped on a piece of rock which accidentally 
dislodged and struck his climbing partner. He was killed instantly.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are
aware of the death of a British national and we are providing consular 
assistance to the family.'

His death is the second in the park in 24 hours and the fourth this season.

Aleh Kalman, 19, was 
visiting the park on Saturday with a church group when he was seen 
swimming in the Merced River above Nevada Fall.

Park officials say witnesses watched 
as he was swept away by the current as he was swimming back from a large
rock located in the middle of the river.

He then went over the nearly 
600-foot falls.

Teams of
rescue workers - as well as a California Highway Patrol helicopter and 
teams of search dogs - were immediately dispatched in an effort to 
locate Kalman, but to no avail.

After searching for nearly three days, rescuers suspended the search for Kalman. He is presumed dead.
