The new, futuristic-looking Lexus NX 300h hybrid sports utility vehicle hits Britain's roads this month.

More than 800 advance orders have been taken for the mid-sized, compact, petrol-electric crossover, costing from £29,495 for the entry level S version with front-wheel drive and up to £42,995 for the fully loaded, all-wheel-drive Premier trim variant.

Five equipment grades are on offer. They're creating a buzz and I've already had people ask whether they should opt to buy one before considering its archrival, the Range Rover Evoque, another radically styled vehicle.

The new Lexus features wireless charging for smart phones, a panoramic view monitor, head-up display and blind spot monitor

The Lexus NX will be the first model to feature Lexus's 'pre-crash' safety system and adaptive cruise control as standard.

Add wireless charging for smart phones, a panoramic view monitor, head-up display and blind spot monitor and it's quite a package.

Standard features of the S include 17in alloy wheels, hill assist control and speed-sensitive automatic door locking. Comfort and gadget levels increase through the trim levels.

The flagship Premier includes 18in alloys, Lexus premium navigation, a 360-degree panoramic view, lane-keep assist and heated steering wheel. The NX 200t, with a new 2-litre turbocharged petrol engine, follows next March.

If you want your car to yomp ahead of the field in the British Touring Car Championships, what more cunning a plan than to get the Parachute Regiment on your side?

Let's face it, who's going to dare overtake you? Premium car firm Infiniti, along with Support Our Paras Racing, this week revealed the vehicle and team that will be entered into next season's Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship.

The aim is to raise awareness and funds for Support Our Paras, the regiment's official charity.

The team, overseen by principal Derek Palmer, consists of injured paratroopers who'll work on the cars, prepare them for race weekends and maintain them. Long term, the team aims to train injured paratrooper graduates to drive Infiniti race cars.

The two Infiniti Q50 cars will be driven by Richard Hawken (Waltonon-Thames) and Derek Palmer Jnr (Lanark/Zurich).

Hawken said he was honoured to help: 'These guys put their neck on the line for us every day in their normal duties. When they do get injured, we should all collectively do what we can by way of a personal thank you and contribute to the charity, which helps to give them as normal a life as possible.' The Parachute Regiment lost 26 soldiers in Afghanistan, with more than 130 others wounded.

Congestion will cost the average family more than £2,000 a year in lost time and effort as the cumulative burden on the economy tops £300billion over the next 16 years, a new report has revealed.

But that'll more than double for families in London — Britain's most congested city — with drivers spending the equivalent of eight extra working weeks a year stuck in cars.

The population is set to rise from 64 million to 72 million by 2030. This means gridlock will worsen, resulting in 'a terrible shock' for households, says the report.

The study, from satnav data suplier INRIX and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), covered the UK's 18 largest urban areas. Our 63 per cent increase will be the highest among major world economies, and compares to a 50 per cent rise in the U.S. and 31 per cent in Germany and France.

A series of limited-edition tax disc holders, called Pretty Taxing has been produced by artists including Sir Peter, Gavin Turk, Pam Hogg, Sarah Lucas and Jessica Albarn

Feeling nostalgic for the demise of the tax disc already? Think your windscreen will start looking naked without those little perforations? Fear not. Britain's artistic community has come to your aid, spearheaded by Sir Peter Blake, creator of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper album cover.

A series of limited-edition tax disc holders, called Pretty Taxing has been produced by artists including Sir Peter, Gavin Turk, Pam Hogg, Sarah Lucas and Jessica Albarn.

The eye-catching designs (Gavin Turk's is pictured left) are printed on archival quality art paper. Each is inserted into its own tax disc holder, and each reflects the artist's signature style.

Every one has a certificate of authenticity and a circular artwork, both hand numbered with its edition number. The specially designed packaging is also hand numbered.

The holders stick to any glass surface, be it your windscreen or at home. It's part of the Vauxhall Art Car Boot Fair which encourages artistic endeavour linked to the motor car.

Vauxhall spokesman Denis Chick said: 'The Pretty Taxing series is an eye-catching in-car accessory, giving people the opportunity to take their artwork on the road with them.' The art of tax? Or a tax on art? The Pretty Taxing artworks cost from £40 and can be bought via artcarbootfair.com.
