Britain must build new roads that 'lift the soul' and banish the ugly and 'brutalist' monstrosities of the past, Transport minister John Hayes said today.

He announced that new highways will in future have to pass a 'beauty test' before they are built, with local residents and campaigners having a key voice in their design. 

They should 'invoke the spirit of poet Sir John Betjemen and be in 'harmony' with their surroundings and 'blend in' with the landscape rather than being 'brutalising, ugly and dull'.

A special 'Roads Design Panel' comprised of campaign groups, architects, engineers, highways authorities and suppliers, would have vet a new highway's aesthetic appeal. 

Firms bidding for road contracts will have to consider beauty – not just cost-cutting budgets - when tendering. 

The aim is to end fifty years of brutalist blight since the 1960s when Britain got it 'very, very wrong' and to create a future where Britain is 'criss-crossed by award winning roads' rather than 'hideous footbridges.' 

Mr Hayes said: 'I want design to create new landmarks that will be featured in local guides for decades to come. 

'I want new bridges that are not only useful but that are loved by the people who use them.'

The Minister's plan to end decades of poorly designed highways in the countryside and inner-cities was unveiled at an event hosted by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England and the Campaign for Better Transport and attended by former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion who chairs the CPRE. 

Mr Hayes said: 'There is a well-trodden path we have been down as a nation many times when it comes to major public projects over the past century – and that is the path of mere utility, of banality, even ugliness.' 

The former energy minister who insists 'wind turbines are 'simply ugly' said the view from the driver's seat of a legendary E-Type Jaguar should be as beautiful as the car itself: 'It's perhaps ironic that we care so much about car design, about the sleek lines gracing our sports saloons, about the leather trimmed interiors and the burr walnut dashboards…when the scene outside the car is often so ugly.'

The rot set in after the 1950s, he said: 'As the road network developed we seem to have cared less and less about good design. We grew to accept that roads and motorways must be intrinsically ugly.'

But he insisted: 'I believe roads can lift the soul.' 

He made a strong connection between ugly roads and the 'failure of tower blocks as a social experiment' from the 1960s and '70s noting: 'It seems so obvious that beautiful buildings and places can places designed in harmony with nature can often lift the spirits and inspire people…while so many discordant, ugly, post-war tower blocks and housing estates have blighted lives and destroyed communities.' 

Mr Hayes drew on the Prince of Wales's ten design principles set out last year as inspiration for government plans to build £15billion of new roads by 2020

Announcing a 'fresh start', he said: 'Roads are part of our landscape. We cannot uninvent the car or order people to stay in the village of their birth. So we need to integrate roads into their surroundings, flowing with the landscape or concealing structures where possible.' 

He said: 'Beauty should not just be seen as a 'nice to have' something important that can enhance well-being.

'We want roads to be based on principles of good design'.

And he noted: 'Good design need be no more expensive than bad design.' 

He said the Hindhead Bypass and the planned Stonehenge by-pass were examples of what could be achieved while the Boston Manor viaduct on the M4 was an example of what to avoid. 

Citing bold new stations on the railways he said: 'We have reclaimed the vision of Sir John Betjeman, whose statue rightly adorns the reborn St Pancras. 

'I want to see a similar vision for our road network and for the service areas, the bridges and tunnels that are integral to it.' 

He stressed: 'Let's be absolutely clear. For a long time we got it very, very wrong. We allowed sub-standard, ubiquitous, drab, cheap, soul-sapping design to proliferate until it became the norm. And as a nation we shrugged our shoulders.' 

He also noted: 'As individuals we may not have liked it. But collectively as governments, local councils, highways authorities, motorist organisations, architects, we didn't do anything to change it.' 

But he stressed: 'Right now we have an opportunity to banish ugly design from new road schemes and make sure it never returns.'

More tunnels and better noise barriers will help roads blend more easily into the landscape. But Cutting light pollution should not be at the expense of road safety.

In 1994, Prince Charles began developing Poundbury (pictured), an eco-village in Dorset, inspired by his ideas about architecture and planning

As an example of what can be achieved, Roads minister John Hayes cited the recent Hindhead Tunnel bypass: 'A tunnel was built to bypass the village of Hindhead and remove a notorious traffic bottleneck.

'Developers planted 200,000 trees and shrubs to provide a magnificent haven for wildlife and lovers of our countryside.' 

The scheme reunited two previously split commons creating the largest area of lowland heath in Southern Britain and the National Trust sowed heather on broken earth where the old road had been. 

The A30 main road into Cornwall from Bodmin to Indian Queens – lined with local Cornish hedges of stone and vegetation - is another 'award-wining' scheme.

The proposed Stonehenge Tunnel to bypass the ancient monument in Wiltshire is among the schemes that also exemplify ambitions for the future, as well as the A27 on the South Coast and the A417 in Gloucestershire where design and environmental concerns have been considered. He said: 'I want these schemes to be trail-blazers for the future – a future where Britain is criss-crossed by award-winning roads.' 

By contrast he cited the Boston Manor viaduct on the M4 as an example of what to avoid, describing it as 'a set of brutalist monoliths that seem to have escaped from the grimmer end of some American metropolis.' 

And with some councils fretting more about the plight of newts than the landscape, he said: 'Some recent examples of good practice have perhaps focussed too much on local amphibian populations.' 

Mr Hayes noted: 'Ring-roads, footbridges, underpasses and pedestrianisation have all served to create a destructive sense of alienation from the built environment.' 

He said he wanted to put 'pride' back into UK roads: 'Our goal is not just to undo the most intrusive road design of the past 50 years.

It is to create new aesthetic values that reflect and even magnify the beauty of the local landscape.' 

Mr Hayes plans to appoint a special 'Roads Design Panel' including campaign groups such as the CPRE and architects, engineers and suppliers, to 'enhance the beauty of the countryside' while also involving local communities in planning. 

Local people would be involved early in design issues and at public consultation stage. Under the new proposals materials, size and pavements and other aspects of design could be considered locally . 

He also drew on the Prince of Wales's ten design principles set out last year as inspiration for government plans to build £15billion of new roads by 2020. 

In 1994, Prince Charles began developing Poundbury, an eco-village in Dorset, inspired by his ideas about architecture and planning. The eco-village – which is now home to 5,000 residents – was built so the houses, pedestrian-friendly streets, squares and lanes reflect the surrounding landscape and architecture.

Sir Andrew Motion, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) and former Poet Laureate welcomed the ministers plans but said building new roads through the countryside should in any case be a 'last resort'. 

He said:'The Minister's ambition to create a greater harmony between our road network and our priceless countryside is a noble aim, and I wholeheartedly welcome his understanding that our roads must be improved for the benefit of communities and the countryside.

'I hope his ideas for blending existing roads with the landscape - while reducing the noise, air and light pollution they produce - are taken just as seriously by his colleagues in the Government. And in outlining such good ideas for improving our existing roads, it raises the question - why spend the vast majority of the DfT's budget on new roads?' 

Sir Andrew said: 'If we care about the countryside – its look, its feel, its sustainability, its durability - we must not trail yet more concrete highways through green fields, so they can simply fill up with more cars, emitting more fumes to hasten the death of the planet. New roads should always be an option of last resort.'
