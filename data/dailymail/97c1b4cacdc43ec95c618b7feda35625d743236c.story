George Zimmerman’s father took the stand today at his son’s bond hearing, telling the Florida court in a sort of mini-trial that the chilling howl in the now notorious 911 tapes were ‘absolutely George’s.’

Robert Zimmerman told those in the Seminole County courtroom in Sanford – including the parents of slain teen Travyon Martin – that the screams are from his son, George, and not Martin, which goes directly against what Martin’s parents testified.

Both were wearing dark suits and conservative ties, and the faint lines of bulletproof vests could be seen under each of their shirts.

Taking the stand: George Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, told the court at his son's bond hearing that the screams from the 911 tapes are 'absolutely George's'

Appearance: George Zimmerman, left, seen with longer hair, and attorney Don West appear before Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester, Jr. today; Zimmerman did not testify

George Zimmerman himself did not testify at the hearing, though his attorney, Mark O’Mara briefly considered it.

The judge presiding over the case, Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester, did not immediately release a decision on whether or not he will again allow Zimmerman to post bond, nor did he indicate when he might make a decision.

He had revoked Zimmerman's bond earlier this month when prosecutors told the judge Zimmerman and his wife misled the court about how much money they had during the April bond hearing.

Prosecutors said a website Zimmerman created for his legal defence had raised $135,000 at the time of his first bond hearing, and Zimmerman and his wife did not mention the money then.

Much of the bond hearing focused on the donations raised through a PayPal account and how it was repeatedly transferred between bank accounts Zimmerman and his wife controlled.

Waiting game: Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester has not decided whether or not to let Zimmerman out on bond again; he revoked the first $150,000 bond earlier this month

'It was done to hide the money so they could deceive the court, lie to the court. Mr. Zimmerman lied to the court and this defendant just sat there and let it happen,' prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda said.

Zimmerman's attorney attempted to show there was no effort to hide the money from the judge.'It is not the grand conspiracy the state seems to suggest,' Mr O’Mara said.

There was also a great deal of evidence and testimony about the head injuries Zimmerman suffered the night of the fight with Martin, including a broken nose and cuts on his skull.

Zimmerman was also described by a probation officer as a 'model client' who had not violated any of his previous bond conditions.

At times, the bond hearing had the flavour of a trial or a self-defence hearing, with both sides presenting what sounded like opening statements.

Attorneys for Zimmerman called prosecutors' case weak and said he gave 11 voluntary statements to police and re-enacted the shooting with authorities. O'Mara twice played a chilling 911 call in which someone is repeatedly screaming 'help' in the background. A gunshot is also heard on the recording.

George Zimmerman's father took the witness stand and testified that he was certain that it was his son yelling for help on the tape.

Prosecutors argued they had evidence that Zimmerman was the aggressor and chased Martin, who they said acted in self-defence.

But the judge was not ruling on the merits of the case. Instead, the judge was focused on what happened at the previous bond hearing.

Zimmerman's attorney called an expert on finances to testify, attempting to show that Zimmerman and his wife did not try to hide anything.

Adam Magill, a financial forensic specialist, said everything was in order and matched up 'perfectly.' But Magill also testified that moving the money around from different accounts would 'make it appear that you didn't have the money.'

Prosecutors also said the couple talked in code during recorded jailhouse conversations about how to transfer the donations to different bank accounts. At one point, George Zimmerman asked how much money they had. She replied '$155.' Prosecutors allege that was code for $155,000.

Their reference to 'Peter Pan' was code for the PayPal system through which the donations were made, prosecutors said.

Shellie Zimmerman has since been charged with perjury. She is out of jail on $1,000 bond and her arraignment is set for July 31.

Zimmerman's defence also played videos of Zimmerman talking and showing his injuries after the shooting. Attorneys then spent time questioning Kevin O'Rourke, a Sanford firefighter and emergency medical technician who responded to the shooting scene. Attorneys asked questions about the extent of Zimmerman's injuries, particularly how much blood was on his head and face.

'A good 45 per cent of his head and face were covered with blood,' O'Rourke said.

Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 at a gated apartment community in Sanford. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty and claims the shooting was self-defence under the state's 'stand your ground' law.

Martin's parents and supporters claim the teenager was targeted because he was black and Zimmerman started the confrontation that led to the shooting. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic.The 44 days between the shooting and Zimmerman's arrest inspired nationwide protests, led to the departure of the Sanford police chief and prompted a U.S. Department of Justice probe.
