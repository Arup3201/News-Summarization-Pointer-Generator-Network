Police have been forced to patrol a beach to warn off treasure hunters after a shipping container stuffed with a million cigarettes washed up on the Devon coast.

The 40-foot box - which contains 14 tonnes of cigarettes - was washed off of a tanker along with 516 others during a fierce storm in the Bay of Biscay earlier this month.

It is thought the Danish container which landed at Seaton, Devon, could be the first of many to wash up on the Lyme Bay coast in the coming days.

Landfall: The container washed up in Seaton, Devon, this morning

Cargo: The errant container spilled its contents onto the pebbly beach

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is arranging recovery of the Maersk container which landed in the early hours of this morning, but have been delayed by the high tide.

Police officers who have cordoned off the beach issued a stern warning to anyone hoping to pick up any free loot.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'It was reported by a member of the public at 8.10am this morning and officers are on scene to make sure no one puts themselves at risk to recover anything.

'The contents belong initially to the original owner of the container, and then to the official Receiver of Wrecks, so anyone taking anything that washes ashore, even one packet of cigarettes, is effectively committing theft and will be prosecuted.

'So the message to anyone intending to go down there looking for free fags is don't bother.'

Warning: Police have told potential looters to stay away

Hands off: Police reminded locals that the cargo belongs to the shipping company first, and second to the official Receive of Wrecks

The 1998-built ship was reportedly heading from Rotterdam to Sri Lanka when the containers toppled into the sea after it was caught in a fierce storm on February 14.

The containers tipped out of the ship, which was pitching at 40 degrees in the storm, and spilled out into the sea - the biggest loss of cargo ever for the company.

The police spokesman added: 'We're told most of them would have sunk or washed up in France, but this was one that bobbed its way all the way to here,' said the police spokesman.

Elsewhere in the county a large fossil was among debris washed up as a result of the recent storms.

The football-sized fossil was discovered among items washed up on Chesil Beach near Weymouth, Dorset.

It is thought the fossil could be an ammonite, a type of marine mollusc which died out 66 million years ago.

The piece of history is just one in a succession of marvels unearthed along the country's coast by this winter’s devastating storms and floods.

It comes after a stash of unexploded bombs has been revealed along the South West coast and in parts of Wales.

The storms that have ravaged and reshaped parts of the British coastline have led to the discovery of wartime shells long-buried on beaches.

There are also fears that flooding along the Thames will erode riverbanks, leading to the discovery of bombs dropped on the area by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War.

Police say that high tides and huge waves have either exposed devices or brought them closer to the surface.

Further storms and flooding are expected as a new front moves in from the Atlantic. The Met Office has issued three severe rain warnings and gusts of wind are expected to reach 70mph.

The Environment Agency also still has 48 severe flood warnings issued across the UK following what the Met Office has described as the wettest winter on record.

Now walkers are being urged not to touch unidentified metal objects but to alert police to their finds instead.

In South West England and West Wales, which bore the brunt of the storms, six devices have been handled by bomb disposal units in six weeks.

The Navy’s Southern Diving Group said it had received a 20 per cent increase in reports of unexploded bombs since January.

A 100lb Mk XIX Second World War 
British anti-submarine mine was found by surfers at Watwick Bay, 
Haverfordwest, while a rare First World War German mine surfaced on a 
beach near the popular Cornish resort of Newquay.

Two mortar shells were found 
in Poole Harbour, and mortars have emerged on the shore at Mountbatten 
Point, Plymouth, and Crow Point, North Devon.

Across the country, more mild weather has seen the floods almost vanish from Thames-side streets

A shell at Minehead, Somerset – close to a former naval firing range – was also made safe. Meanwhile a mortar was discovered on a beach at Hemsby, Great Yarmouth.

‘Ferocious seas and weather are thought to be responsible,’ said Sergeant Lee Henderson of Devon and Cornwall Police. ‘There is also the potential for further bad weather to unearth more devices.

‘The bombs may still be very dangerous and people should not touch them but call police officers immediately.’

Other glimpses of wartime Britain have been uncovered at Woolacombe, North Devon, one of the key training beaches for the D-Day landings. The storms  revealed an old pill box together with concrete anchorages and pile-driven iron girders.
