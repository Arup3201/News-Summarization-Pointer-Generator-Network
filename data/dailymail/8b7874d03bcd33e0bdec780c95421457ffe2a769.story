Experts are warning against a risky new cocktail trend that encourages drinkers to inhale alcohol rather than swallow it.

The 'Vaportini' - glass apparatus designed to heat high volume alcohol - caused uproar in the U.S. when it was launched in 2012, with doctors claiming potentially serious side effects as smoking alcohol is toxic to the lungs.

Now the trend appears to be gathering pace in the UK ahead of the summer festival season leading to charities and experts warning young professionals against unsafe alcohol consumption.

First released in December 2012, the $40 (£28) Vaportini acts in a manner similar to a traditional vaporizer, heating and releasing intoxicating vapors which are breathed through a straw after being heated by a candle to 140 Fahreneheit.

Bypassing the digestive system, the Vaportini causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs, potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused.

Inventor and bar owner Julie Palmer created the simple glass and steel contraption after a night in Helsinki inhaling vodka fumes over a coal fire. She claims that taking the alcohol directly into the bloodstream has the advantage of 'almost no calories, no carbs, no impurities and immediate effects'.

The alcohol fumes are ingested via a glass straw and pass straight into the blood stream

But while the idea of a calorie-free high is appealing to diet-conscious drinkers experts and authorities here have been quick to slam the trend.

The London Fire Brigade is concerned that the craze will end up costing lives. Group Manager Mark Hazelton said: 'Any product which encourages people to light candles when consuming alcohol is a concern. We don’t want to sound like killjoys, but products like the Vaportini could lead to a worrying rise in the number of people being burned and causing fires while drunk.'

A spokesman told the London Evening Standard:
 'The Brigade believes that heating alcohol in this way could increase 
the risk of someone having a serious fire which could destroy their home
 or, even worse, kill them.

'Firefighters
 are reminding people that drinking and naked flames don’t mix and that 
one in four people who die in a fire has alcohol in their system.

'The
 figures show that young professionals had 1,515 house fires last year 
and the Brigade is concerned that this figure could rise.'

Vaportini sell various kits of apparatus online, with prices starting at $40 (£24)

Meanwhile Professor Jonathan Chick, advisor to alcohol education charity Drinkaware explained the process: 'Alcohol
 is a volatile liquid. As temperature rises, it turns to vapour at some 
40 degree Celsius sooner than water. Thus a beverage from a bottle of 
spirits, which is part alcohol and part water can be heated and the 
alcohol vapour inhaled, as those in the kitchen warming Gluhwein at 
Christmas will recall.

'It 
enters through the lung tissue into the bloodstream. If a small measure 
of a spirit, say 1 unit, was heated and inhaled it all enters the blood 
stream and will still have to be metabolised by the liver in the end, 
although it is true that there is less immediate 'hit' on the liver by 
this method.

'However, 
there is greater 'hit' on the brain, than when alcohol is taken by 
mouth, because some of it has not already been broken down on its way 
through the liver and this will increase the risk of damage to brain 
cells. So the method cannot be called safer to the body organs.

'There
 is an added risk of inhalation which is due to the direct impact on the
 brain - that is, risk of unsteadiness, falling or impulsive behaviour.

'It
 is possible that the vapour method may lead to some taking larger 
quantities of alcohol than they would have done if they were only 
ingesting by mouth through the stomach, because the stomach can limit 
its emptying rate with strong concentrations of spirit, and may 
sometimes cause vomiting, which is a limiting step.

'The
 vapour method will be used by those who are looking for rapid 
intoxication. Some unwanted effects of alcohol may also be felt more 
rapidly, by the consumer and those around.'

Professor Chris Day added: 'The fact that it bypasses your body’s natural defence mechanisms against consuming too much alcohol means it is unsafe.

'Inhaling alcohol is a very new trend so there isn't yet any scientific data of the effects but it has the potential to be a very dangerous phenomenon and as such, we would advise people to be cautious if indeed they do decide to try it.'

The alcohol is heated using a small candle or tea light

Inventor Julie Palmer created the boozy gadget with the help of her engineer father. She says: 
'We spent several interesting afternoons testing the best temperature 
for alcohol to evaporate from spirits. We also explored several ways to 
achieve and sustain that optimal temperate.

'This
 led to research in the heat density of many substances, diamonds have 
the highest heat density, but are completely impractical. We settled on 
lead, but it had to be protected from human contact, for obvious 
reasons.

'I found a hollow 
stainless steel base that could be filled with lead. I worked with a 
local metal worker to fill them. The purchased glass vessels were 
modified, creating an air intake close to the surface of the spirits, 
insertion of a straw to inhale the evaporated alcohol, and insuring a 
close contact of the base to the glass vessel. I heated the bases in a 
small oven, filled the vessel with liquor, and placed it in the base. 
Within 5 minutes, the alcohol had evaporated from the spirits and was 
ready to inhale.'
