It was the decade that dedicated foodies would rather forget, when the height of sophistication was a prawn cocktail and a Chicken Kiev.

But it seems our nostalgia for all things retro has sparked a shopping basket revival for the 70s.

Sales of Arctic rolls (that deliciously barmy dessert made of a jam roll filled with ice cream) have risen by over 40 per cent, while chicken Kievs are up by 59 per cent.

Even quiche sales have soared by almost 20 per cent as customers of Ocado, who deliver all Waitrose’s online groceries, have turned back the clock.

The added ingredient of a celebrity chef has certainly helped.

Heston Blumenthal, the face of Waitrose, has concocted his modern take on the 70s classic prawn cocktail for the supermarket.

Sales of the £2.99 classic, one of the chef’s ‘all-time favourite things to eat’ after a hard night at his three-star Michelin restaurant according to the marketing blurb, are up by 95 per cent.

And even Angel Delight - the packet-mix mousse beloved of children everywhere - has made a comeback.

Many of the original artificial flavourings and sweeteners have been removed, which makes it more attractive to Waitrose mum’s shopping basket.

Sales of Angel Delight have risen by more than five per cent, while another children’s classic Soda Stream has seen its popularity soar by 82 per cent.

Jason Gissing, Ocado Co-Founder said: ‘I was born in 1970 so I’m excited to see my childhood foods making a come-back in our digital age and holding their own alongside more modern staples like ready meals, organic veg boxes and sushi.

‘The internet hadn’t even been invented in the 70s and shopping online for groceries would have been unthinkable 40 years ago.

‘Now
 customers can order their Chicken Kievs with just a few clicks from 
Ocado and have them delivered to their kitchen table later that day 
without even having to leave the house.

‘We’ve changed people’s lives and we’ll continue to do so for the next 40 years and beyond!’
