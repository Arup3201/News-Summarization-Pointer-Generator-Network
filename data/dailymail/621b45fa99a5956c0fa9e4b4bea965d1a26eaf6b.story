City regulators who sanctioned a crack cocaine addict to become chief of the Co-operative Bank were yesterday branded ‘a complete disaster’.

MPs castigated financial watchdogs for rubber-stamping the appointment of Rev Paul Flowers, which they denounced as a farcical ‘box-ticking exercise’.

There is growing incredulity that a man with no banking experience and a penchant for crystal meth and cocaine had been made chairman of a bank.

Co-op last night announced a complete review of the fiasco, as Labour leader Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring Flowers as a business adviser

Rev Flowers, a Methodist minister, was caught on camera buying hard drugs from a car in Leeds a week ago, just days after being grilled by MPs over the disastrous performance of the Co-op.

Stung by the revelations, the Co-op last night announced a complete review of the fiasco, as Labour leader Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring Flowers as a business adviser.

Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, said it was obvious when Flowers appeared before them earlier this month that he was ‘manifestly unsuitable’ to be a bank chairman.

He called for the regulation of senior bankers to be tightened to include continuing and ‘intrusive’ supervision.

‘It’s been a complete disaster. Nothing less than saying that will do,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World At One.

He attacked the ‘approved persons regime’, whereby a City panel supposedly checked the competence of Rev Flowers, as ‘nothing more than a massive bureaucratic, back-covering, box-ticking exercise that satisfied regulators but did little or nothing to protect shareholders or customers of banks’.

In fact Flowers was only checked by the regulator when he became a member of the Co-op board and was not re-interviewed at all when he was promoted to chairman in April 2010.

Flowers quit his post in June this year as his ‘ethical’ bank was driven to the brink of collapse, threatening the retirement incomes of thousands of pensioners.

Yesterday he was also suspended by the Labour Party amid embarrassment over a £50,000 donation to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls.

He faces a police inquiry into his use of hard drugs, and the Co-op announced a ‘root and branch review’ into ‘any inappropriate behaviour’ during the tenure of its former boss.

As the row grew, the Bank of England was forced to deny its Deputy Governor Andrew Bailey had played any part in the ‘easy’ nature of Flowers’ appointment as the Co-op Bank’s chairman.

Flowers had claimed Mr Bailey was on an elite panel of regulators — known as the ‘grey panthers’ — from the now-defunct Financial Services Authority who had approved his appointment.

But Mr Bailey strenuously denied his claim, saying he did not even join the FSA until 2011, a year after the Flowers debacle.

David Ruffley, another member of the Treasury Select Committee, demanded that regulators be hauled in to give evidence.

Describing the downfall of the Co-op Bank as a ‘Greek tragedy’, he said: ‘Clearly someone who was manifestly not up to the job of oversight slipped through the net.’ 

Another Treasury Select Committee member, Jesse Norman, told Channel 4 News: ‘This man had no experience of running any other business yet for political reasons within the Co-operative movement he finds himself at the head of the Co-op bank.’

At the weekend, Flowers, 63, apologised ‘to all I have hurt or failed by my actions’ over the revelations in the Mail on Sunday.

He has also been suspended by the Methodist Church.
