An eight-year-old cancer survivor's dream has come true - he has starred as the lead character in a World War Two action film.

Jacob Angel, who was battling a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumour, asked for the acting opportunity through the Make-A-Wish Foundation while he was between bouts of chemotherapy treatment.

And he didn't disappoint - the 10 minute long movie shows the young star taking orders from an officer, storming a hill with guns drawn and planting a U.S. flag on high ground following a victory.

He decided he wanted to act in a World War Two film after he saw the movie Saving Private Ryan - and the foundation was happy to oblige.

Jacob said: 'I saw this movie called Saving Private Ryan, I thought it was pretty cool and after awhile I started liking war. That's why I picked the movie - of war.'

He and his brother Thomas played the roles of privates, forming an inspiring duo alongside dozens of acting extras.

Asked what part of the film was his favourite, he said it was when he planted the flag at the top of the hill 'because it was like I just won the war', reported ABC7 News.

'Protecting Our Country's Fate' was filmed at the Living History Event at Fort MacArthur Museum in San Pedro, which typically hosts more than 1,000 war re-enactors every year.

His father Tony Angel told the station: 'I tell you, when he put the flag in the culmination of the movie at the top of the hill and saluted the flag, I got all choked up.'

He said the latest tests showed his son was now cancer free and he is starting to put on weight.

When Jacob was diagnosed on March 9, the cancer was labelled at 'stage three' and he underwent surgery five days later. He had his kidney, adrenal gland removed and six lymph nodes removed.

Following this, he then underwent two weeks of radiation and six months of chemotherapy.
