The Prime Minister has said he was prepared to consider legislation that would guarantee an in/out referendum if he wins the general election in 2015

With anti-EU party UKIP set to make a significant breakthrough today, David Cameron has reinforced his commitment to hold a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe.

The Prime Minister said yesterday he was prepared to consider legislation that would guarantee an in/out referendum if he wins the general election in 2015.

More than 100 Conservative MPs have urged Mr Cameron to back legislation on a referendum in this Parliament – even if Labour and the Liberal Democrats conspire to vote it down.

Mr Cameron also sought to reassure 
core Tory voters by acknowledging frustration with the slow pace of 
change on immigration policy, and promised measures in the next few 
weeks to limit immigrants’ access to welfare and the NHS.

Tory
and Labour strategists expect UKIP to perform strongly in today’s 
council polls, taking seats from both parties, and to come second in a 
Commons by-election in the South Shields seat vacated by David 
Miliband. 

One poll 
yesterday suggested UKIP could take as much as 22 per cent of the vote 
in local elections and significantly limit the progress made by Labour.

A third-place showing behind UKIP would trigger a crisis for Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed voters’ hostility to his party was easing, but conceded it could come fourth in terms of vote share today.

Whatever happens, the Conservatives will lose hundreds of council seats last contested in 2009, when Gordon Brown’s government was at the nadir of its popularity and the then opposition won 44 per cent of the vote, compared to Labour’s 12.7 per cent.

Tory high command is preparing to field senior figures to steady nerves over the weekend – echoing Mr Cameron’s message yesterday that the party is far better placed than the governments of Margaret Thatcher were in mid term.

The Tories are preparing a ‘vote Farage, get Miliband’ campaign in the run-up to the 2015 general election – seeking to persuade those who back UKIP as a protest vote today that they risk letting in a pro-EU Labour government if they do the same at a Westminster election.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Their [UKIP’s] policies are coming under scrutiny, their candidates are coming under scrutiny, and that is a welcome part of the political debate.

‘I’m arguing that really it’s a choice of which team do you want to run the county council, and of course the general election, which, I think even more so, will be do you want a Conservative government that’s going to continue the work of getting the deficit down, getting Britain back to work, sorting out the welfare system, reducing immigration – do you want those things?

'Or do you want to put all of that at risk with a Labour party which . . . has only got one idea and that’s to put up borrowing?’

He said that in the coming weeks the Government would introduce rules ‘to make sure that when people come here they are not coming for the health service or the benefit system or anything else’.

Asked whether he would consider an EU referendum Bill in this parliament, he told BBC Radio 4: ‘I think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum. Anything we can to do to strengthen that offer, I am prepared to consider.’ 

Aides said the most probable scenario is for the Tories to support a referendum Bill introduced from the back benches.

Mr Farage said he was open to the idea of joint Tory/UKIP candidates in 2015, adding: ‘The bar to it is simple: David Cameron.’

More than three-quarters of the public do not think they can make any difference to national politics, according to a new poll. And 70 per cent of people said Mr  Cameron and Mr Clegg were not ‘in touch with the concerns of the British public’, the TNS BMRB survey found. The figure was 65 per cent for Mr Miliband.

The Monster Raving Loony Party yesterday called on the Tories to stop describing UKIP supporters as ‘fruitcakes and loonies’ – saying they were not worthy of the name. Spokesman Lord Toby Jug said: ‘We who seek the Holy Grail of loonyism strongly object to the cavalier use of these terms.’
