Israeli troops have shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who was throwing stones at drivers in the occupied West Bank.

The army said soldiers had fired warning shots before opening fire on a group when they persisted hurling the stones at Israeli civilians near the Tapuah settlement, south of Nablus.

Palestinian security officials said the stones had been thrown at military vehicles. They said that a 19-year-old had also been wounded in the same incident.

A Palestinian security official told AP that he believed a second boy was hurt. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss the incident with the media.

The military said it was investigating the incident. 

Israel and Palestine have suffered generations of fighting and tensions, which spilled over last summer in a 50-day war. 

More than 2,100 Palestinians and 72 Israelis were killed in the fighting, which disrupted the lives of millions of people.

Violence began to spiral with the kidnapping and deaths of three Israeli teenagers, allegedly by Hamas. 

This was followed by a suspected revenge killing of 16-year-old Palestinian youth by Israeli extremists. 

Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended cease-fire largely brokered by Egypt later in August - but tensions between Israel and Palestinians remained high, and spiked last month.

Violent demonstrations led Israel in November to restrict Muslim access to a holy site in Jerusalem that includes the al-Aqsa mosque - the third most sacred place in Islam, 

It is also home to the ancient Hebrew Temple Mount - the holiest place in Judaism. With the crackdown came a fresh round of deadly Palestinian attacks. 

According to AFP statistics, around 20 Palestinians have been killed by the army in the West Bank since June.
