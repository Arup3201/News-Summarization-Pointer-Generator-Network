To people who were caught in snarled traffic or had to shovel snow with leaves still on the trees, the storm pulling off the East Coast on Thursday was your basic nor'easter.

To The Weather Channel, it was Athena.

The network has taken to naming winter storms, much like is done for tropical systems.

New system: The Weather Channel has taken to giving winter storms names much as they do for tropical storms with a second storm in the Midwest, pictured off their site, now named Brutus

Unusual: The season's first nor'easter, now uniquely named Athena by The Weather Channel, brought inland snow and strong coastal winds despite leaves still decorating trees like this yard in Massachusetts

The Weather Channel says it makes the storms easier to identify and will raise awareness among those in their paths.

It also draws attention to The Weather Channel at times of bad weather, when the network's ratings usually soar.

The National Weather Service names hurricanes but isn't recognizing the cable channel's winter storm names.

The government agency sent out an advisory to its personnel Wednesday asking them to 'please refrain from using the term "Athena" in any of our products.'

All their own: So long as viewers tune into the Weather Channel they can see storms named like Athena and Brutus, as seen here already reported on their website

Many news services, including The Associated Press, aren't recognizing the names in their coverage, either.

The weather service has said it has no opinion about the names but noted that winter storms can end and redevelop, making it difficult to define where one storm ends and another begins.

Oddly enough, it was the weather service that first dubbed Superstorm Sandy 'Frankenstorm' many days before it made landfall. That nickname faded, in large part because The Weather Channel would not use it for fear it made light of a serious situation.

Covered: Over four inches of snow was seen falling over Central Park's Wollman Rink in New York though leaves still covered the trees there as well

Namesakes: A list of 26 names have been planned out for this winter season primarily using Greek or Roman names while one storm has been named Q for the NYC subway line

At The Weather Channel, a team of 
meteorologists decides which winter storms get names based on factors 
like expected snow depth and wind speed, handing them out no more than 
three days in advance.

Athena was named, in part, for fears that it would add to damage in areas already reeling from Sandy. The winter storm dropped as much as a foot of snow in some parts of New Jersey and knocked out power to tens of thousands of customers.

The Weather Channel has already named another winter storm expected to sock the Northern Plains as Brutus.

Earlier this fall, the network released in advance a list of 26 names it will be using for storms, also like is done for hurricanes.

The names, including Helen, Luna, Magnus and Ukko, are primarily based in Greek or Roman mythology, although the storm dubbed simply Q was named for the New York City subway line.

If anyone is digging out from Zeus in a couple of months, you'll know it has been a brutal winter.
