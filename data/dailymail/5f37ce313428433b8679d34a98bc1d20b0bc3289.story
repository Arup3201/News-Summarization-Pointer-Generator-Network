The Meredith Kercher murder case will be heard in Italy’s highest court of appeal in March next year, more than a year after the second guilty verdict.

Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were re-convicted of killing the 21-year-old British exchange student by a Florence court in January this year.

If the verdict is upheld, Italian officials are expected to start the process of extraditing 27-year-old Knox from the US.

Final verdict: More than a year after being re-convicted of killing Meredith Kercher, Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito's case will be heard in Italy's highest court of appeal

The case will be heard by the Court of Cassation in Rome on March 25th, the highest appeals court in Italy.

A court of cassation does not re-examine the facts of the case, but will only rule on the interpretation of the law in the guilty verdict by the Florence court.

Meredith Kercher, was found dead in 2007, at the age of 21, in the apartment she shared with American student Knox in Perugia, Italy.

Knox and her Italian then-boyfriend Sollecito were initially found guilty of Kercher's murder and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison.

An extradition procedure for Amanda Knox, seen out in New York with new boyfriend last week, can only be launched following a definitive ruling from the supreme court, which could take months or years.

After four years behind bars, the pair were acquitted on appeal and Knox returned to her Washington state hometown.

Knox has since won a creative writing degree and was recently pictured in Brooklyn, New York, on a date with her new rocker boyfriend.

She has vowed that she will never 'willingly' return to Italy if the verdict is upheld

In July her 30-year-old ex and fellow convict graduated from Verona University after writing a thesis describing how he is innocent of Meredith’s murder.

Earlier in the summer, Sollecito gave a press conference in Rome in which he appeared to distance himself from Knox, saying he was 'not a guarantor' for her, adding that he could not be sure if she was with him the whole night when the murder took place.
