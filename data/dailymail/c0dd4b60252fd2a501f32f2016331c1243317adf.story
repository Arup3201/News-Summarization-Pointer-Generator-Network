Thousands of pensioners will pay more for fuel this winter after energy giant E.ON scrapped a cheaper tariff for the elderly.

The company blamed a Government plan to simplify tariffs for the closure of its Age UK deal which offered a cheaper fuel price to those over 60.

It has written to customers to tell them that they have been ‘renewed’ on to its standard fixed rate variable tariff - which costs around £78 more per year.

Pensioners hit: Energy giant E.ON has scrapped its Age UK deal which offered a cheaper price fuel to over 60s

It is the second tariff for the elderly that the company has ended after it axed its StayWarm deal two months ago, leaving tens of thousands of customers facing bill increases of as much as £180.

E.ON, one of the UK’s biggest suppliers, blamed the Prime Minister’s energy tariff simplification plan for the withdrawal of the tariff.

But pressure groups, customers and Ofgem yesterday accused the companies of using the Retail Market Review as an excuse to axe some of the best deals.

The plan was announced last year with great fanfare as a way of enabling consumers to better compare energy tariffs.

It restricted the number of products 
each provider can offer to four for electricity and four for gas. There 
were previously a bewildering array of 500 products on offer.

Aides
claimed the issue was ‘close to [the Prime Minister’s] heart’ as 
figures show that as many as seven in ten households pay over the odds 
for power - some by as much as £300 a year.

E.ON
customer Stephen Bunney, who was on the Age UK tariff, accused the 
company of using the changes as an excuse to put prices up for older 
people on cheap deals.

The
pensioner was on a standard variable Age UK tariff which he claimed was
better value than everything else on the market when he originally 
signed up to it.

He
was pleased with the deal and remained on it for roughly five years, 
but was contacted on December 6 and told that the tariff was being axed.

In the letter to the 65-year-old from Erith, Kent, E.ON wrote: ‘We’re closing your tariff and moving you to E.ON EnergyPlan.

It is the second tariff for the elderly that the company has ended after it axed its StayWarm deal two months ago, leaving tens of thousands of customers facing bill increases of as much as £180

‘As part of an industry wide programme to create a simpler and clearer, fairer and more competitive energy market, we’ve changed our tariffs and the way we pay you any discounts.’

The letter goes on to estimate that the new tariff will cost Mr Bunney £78 more a year and cancels a three per cent energy discount and UK cold weather payments that he previously received.

It also advises him that he can switch to other deals and other suppliers and informed him about a new fixed rate Age UK deal it offers.

But Mr Bunney, a retired BT manager, and his wife, who also worked for BT before she retired, said that the new Age UK tariff offered by E.ON was more expensive.

‘Out of the blue they just took me off the deal and put me on a more expensive one. They are using the Government review as an excuse to remove cheap tariffs,’ he said.

‘They’re getting round what’s going to happen by cutting their cheapest tariffs. Their four tariffs won’t be cheaper ones.

‘It’s probably legally ok but it’s not morally ok. They’re screwing the pensioners yet again.’

Jo Ganly, energy expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Simplification is a good thing for consumers as the energy market has been notoriously difficult for people to get their heads around.

‘However, it’s important that simplification doesn’t come at a cost. The biggest danger is that consumers start to lose discounts and incentives that are valuable to them.

‘This would be like throwing the baby out with the bath water: penalising the savvy who are already shopping around, while removing any incentive that could encourage non-switchers to join in.’

On average bills will be £60 higher than before this year's round of price hikes even after the government deal to reduce green levies by £50

An E.ON spokeswoman refused to confirm how many customers were on the Age UK plan for ‘commercial’ reasons.

She said: ‘To make the market simpler and easier to compare we now offer four core tariffs as part of the new rules being introduced by Ofgem.

‘We’ve written to customers on historic variable products to advise them that their tariff is no longer available and that we’ll be moving them to our standard offering (as required).

‘We hope to have ‘best deal for you’ conversations with these customers about whether there is a better or more suitable product for their needs and urge customers to get in touch.

‘We will continue to offer Age UK fixed products exclusively for the over 60s.’

Age UK take a commission of around 1.5per cent from the tariffs through their enterprise arm which raises money for the charity.

Gordon Morris, Managing Director of Age UK Enterprises, said: ‘While reducing the number of energy tariffs available should help simplify the market following the implementation of the Ofgem Retail Market Review, this customer highlights the important concern that many older people are unaware of the changes taking place and what action they need to take.

‘In the first instance, people should contact their energy supplier to ensure they are on the best tariff - what is important is for all older people to check their energy costs and ensure they are on the best deal for them.’

An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘A key part of our reforms is a restriction on suppliers offering no more than four tariffs for gas and four for electricity.

We have never told suppliers which tariffs they have to close to comply with this rule, as that is a decision for them.

‘And in fact we have been clear with all suppliers that they are allowed to keep social tariffs (which for example offer discounts to customers who have difficulty paying bills) under our rules.’
