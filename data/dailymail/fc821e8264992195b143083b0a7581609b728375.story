Terrorism experts have called on U.S. authorities to refocus their attention on domestic right wing terrorism after it emerged the man behind the atrocities in Norway last week took inspiration from American extremists.

Accused: Anders Behring Breivik wrote a 1,516 page manifesto posted on-line '2083 - A European Declaration Of Independence' and drew inspiration from several American groups

It has emerged that Anders Behring Breivik lifted words from 'Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski and took inspiration from a range of other American right wing and anti-Islamic groups in his rambling 1,500 page manifesto discovered after Friday's attacks.

The fantasist also referenced co-founder of Stop the Islamisation of America, Robert Spencer, more than 50 times.

Spencer - who
 is synonymous with organising protests against the proposed Islamic 
centre near Ground Zero - has frequently written and spoken against the 'threat' of Islamic fundamentalists.

In one such article Spencer wrote: 'Traditional Islam 
contains violent and supremacist elements.'

In a further endorsement, Breivik wrote that Spencer would also be an 'excellent choice' for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Police and Breivik's lawyer says he confessed to, but denied criminal responsibility for Friday's bombing at government headquarters in Oslo and the mass shooting later that day at an island summer camp organised by the youth wing of the ruling Labor Party.

At least 93 people were killed in the attacks.

According to experts, much of the manifesto outlining his reasoning behind the attacks was directly inspired by U.S. extremist groups - many of whom are directly quoted.

Speaking to NBC news, 
security expert Daryl Johnson said: 'This attack in Norway should be a wake up for our decision 
makers.

'We could have a similar attack here, and that’s my greatest fear.

'We could have a Timothy McVeigh-type
 carry out a mass shooting event or a vehicle bomb attack that resulted 
in mass casualties.'

Part 
of Breivik's manifesto was taken almost word for word from the first few
 pages of the anti-technology manifesto written by Kaczynski, who is in 
federal prison for mail bombs that killed three people and injured 23 
others across the U.S. from the 1970s to the 1990s.

In
 the writings, the Norwegian terrorist wrote of 'brutal and breathtaking
 operations' in order to stop 'the ongoing Islamic Colonisation of 
Europe.'

Speaking to NBC news, Spencer denied  responsibility for what happened in Norway.

He said: 'There’s nothing in any of my writings that is anything but a 
defence of human rights, a defence of the equality of rights of all 
people before the law.

'So if somebody gets from that that they should kill, well then he’s nuts.'

In his 1,500-page manifesto, Breivik 
styles himself as a Christian conservative, patriot and nationalist.

Despite his own anti-Muslim views, he looks down on neo-Nazis as 
'underprivileged racist skinheads with a short temper.'

Breivik changed a Kaczynski screed on
 leftism and what he considered to be leftists' 'feelings of 
inferiority' - mainly by substituting the words 'multiculturalism' or 
'cultural Marxism' for 'leftism.'

For
 instance, Kaczynski wrote: 'One of the most widespread manifestations 
of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the 
psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of 
the problems of modern society in general.'

Breivik's manifesto reads: 'One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is multiculturalism, so a discussion of the psychology of multiculturalists can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of Western Europe in general.'

In Internet postings attributed to Breivik on Norwegian websites, he blamed Europe's left-wing parties for destroying the continent's Christian heritage by allowing mass immigration of Muslims.

He said he came into contact with like-minded individuals across Europe, and together they formed a military order inspired by the Knights Templar crusaders.

Their goal: to conquer Europe by 2083 in a string of coups. Norwegian police couldn't say whether the group existed.

Speaking to NBC, Heidi Beirich from 
the Southern Poverty Law Center said: 'When you push the demonisation of
 populations, you often end up with violence.'

A
 recently released report from the centre noted an upswing in 
anti-Islamic attacks in the United States in the past few years, 
including the burning of a mosque in Tennessee arsons and bombings in 
Florida, Michigan and Oregon.

Breivik wrote in his manifesto that he was a boy when his life's path began to turn.

It was during the first Gulf War, when a Muslim friend cheered at reports of missile attacks against American forces.

'I
 was completely ignorant at the time and apolitical but his total lack 
of respect for my culture (and Western culture in general) actually 
sparked my interest and passion for it,' the suspect in Norway's bombing
 and mass shooting wrote in his 1,500-page manifesto.

From
 September 2009 through October 2010, Breivik posted more than 70 times 
on Dokument.no, a Norwegian site with critical views on Islam and 
immigration.

In one comment, he entertained the idea of a European Tea Party movement.
