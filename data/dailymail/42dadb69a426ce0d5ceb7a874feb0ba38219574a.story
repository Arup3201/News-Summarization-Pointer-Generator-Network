The issue of spitting, sadly, has emerged again this week with Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse both being condemned.

As usual, there have been a number of people who have said 'it is the worst thing that can happen on a pitch'; it is vile but let me assure you now – I would have preferred Lucas Neill to have spat at me the day he broke my leg in September 2003!

I was spat at once in my career. It came during a UEFA Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 and the player in question was a Russian midfielder called Aleksander Mostovoi. I was shocked more than angry when he did it because I couldn't believe what had happened.

The issue of spiting in football has, sadly, raised its head again after Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse clashed

Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates 

The only time Carragher was spat on was in a UEFA Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 

Louis van Gaal is getting results, it's time for everyone to get off the Manchester United manager's back... CLICK HERE to read on.

Cisse has admitted being in the wrong and hit with a seven-game ban. I know it is a disgusting thing to do but I do think that punishment seems a little excessive, particularly if you compare it to an over-the-top tackle that would 'only' get three games.

For Evans, the incident doesn't look good at all. It would have been easy enough for him to spit well away from Cisse.

One final thing: all those people who have said about Evans 'he's not that type of lad'. Who is then? 

Is there are a list somewhere of names who are 'that type'? It is a stupid thing to say. It's not about his character. It's about whether he had a moment of madness, deliberately or not.
