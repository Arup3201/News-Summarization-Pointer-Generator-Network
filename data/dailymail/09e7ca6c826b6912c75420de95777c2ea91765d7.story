A patient has died in hospital following an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease  in Stoke-on-Trent.

A further 15 people are confirmed as suffering from the disease. All those affected are aged between their late-40s and mid-70s.

The person who died was being treated at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where officials are waiting for a cause of death from the coroner. No further details were released.

A sokesman for University Hospital of 
North Staffordshire said: 'The trust is currently treating 11 patients 
confirmed with Legionnaires' disease who are all in a stable or 
improving condition.

'One patient has sadly died.

'Three patients are well enough to go home and have been discharged.'

The number of confirmed cases has been steadily rising since news of the outbreak first emerged on Tuesday.

Public
and environmental health experts from the HPA, the Health and Safety 
Executive, the NHS in Stoke and Stoke-on-Trent City Council continue to 
work together to identify and investigate possible sources.

Health investigators are currently searching up to 12 buildings in the city for the source of the deadly bug.

The results of samples taken from all seven water cooling towers in the city are still awaited.

The towers, which are condensers for air conditioning systems, have also been treated with chlorine as a precaution.

All
of the patients affected live in the Longton, Meir and Fenton areas of 
Stoke-on-Trent and are aged between their late 40s and mid 70s.

Legionnaires' disease, also known as Legionellosis, is associated with poorly maintained air conditioning cooling towers and potable water systems

Professor
Harsh Duggal, director of the Health Protection Agency's health 
protection unit in Stafford, said: 'Our investigation into possible 
sources continues and we have been able to obtain detailed information 
on the movements of those affected.

'Early
microbiology typing results back from the HPA laboratories show samples
taken from some of the patients look very similar.

'This is consistent with the people having caught their infection from the same environmental source.

'We
are taking detailed histories of the movements of the patients to see 
if there are similar patterns which would indicate a local source of 
infection.

'We are now working with HPA experts in mapping the outbreak and our partners to pinpoint possible sources.'

Pensioner Pattricka De-igo, 74, of Fenton, Staffs, was rushed to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in a critical condition last weekend.

Killer: Three people died after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Edinburgh at the end of May

GPs in the affected communities are being told to look out for any patients showing symptoms of the potentially fatal disease.

Longton GP Dr James McCarthy said: 'We have had a letter from the HPA asking us to be vigilant about Legionnaires' Disease.'

Legionnaires' Disease is caught by breathing in infected water mainly from poorly-maintained or designed air conditioning systems. It cannot be passed between people.

Stoke-on-Trent's director of public health Dr Zafar Iqbal said: 'Legionnaires' Disease is a rare but potentially life-threatening illness.

'You cannot catch Legionnaires' Disease from drinking water.

'The early symptoms include a 'flu-like' illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough and fever which can then lead to pneumonia.

'As with any pneumonia, the patient can become very unwell.

'Diarrhoea and confusion might occur, as well as chest and breathing symptoms.

However, Legionnaires' Disease can be effectively treated with a course of antibiotics and this is best done as early as possible.'

An outbreak in Edinburgh in May which claimed the lives of three people is thought to have centred on a cluster of cooling towers in the Scottish city.
