While Tim Krul has been hailed as the hero for Holland in the quarter-final penalty shoot-out his antics as Costa Rica players approached to take their kicks went beyond gamesmanship.

The Newcastle goalkeeper should have been told to stop his face-pulling and sledging by Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov who had been excellent until that point. 

After standing by the assistant referee while his team are taking their kicks, as the law requires, he should have been made to go straight to the goal to face the next spot-kick.

When he did not, Krul should have been warned and then cautioned for unsporting behaviour if he had ignored the referee. If he had carried on his antics he could have been sent off.

However, because Irmatov failed even to warn Krul it is hard to blame the Dutchman too much for continuing to try to unsettle the Costa Rica penalty-takers.

There was debate as to whether it was fair for Holland coach Louis Van Gaal to make the late substitution which enabled him to put on the goalkeeper he thought best to face the spot-kicks.

There is no issue within the laws of the game and, of course, he sacrificed the chance to bring on a fresh outfield player.
