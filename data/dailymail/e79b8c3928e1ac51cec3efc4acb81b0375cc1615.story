The astonishing extent of the bitter feud at the heart of the Al-Hilli family was revealed yesterday.

In
 a letter written last year, murdered Saad Al-Hilli, 50, said his 
brother Zaid, 53, was a ‘control freak’ and he wanted to ‘wipe him out 
of my life’.

The 
aeronautical engineer told a childhood friend he had cut off his older 
brother after ‘underhand things’ took place over their late father’s 
assets.

Feud: In
 a letter written last year, murdered Saad Al-Hilli, 50, (right) said his 
brother Zaid, 53, (left) was a ‘control freak’ and he wanted to ‘wipe him out 
of my life’

His candid comments will interest 
detectives in Britain and France as they widen their investigation and 
examine potential tensions in the sprawling family of Iraqi refugees.

The
 letter was written by Saad Al-Hilli last September and appears to 
confirm previous suggestions of a possible inheritance dispute between 
himself and his brother Zaid.

For his part, Zaid has strenuously denied 
there was any feud between them and is said to be ‘devastated’.

Saad
 told old friend Mae Faisal El-Wailly, who lives in Arizona and 
described the family as ‘wealthy and well-travelled’, that they are no 
longer speaking. He wrote: ‘Zaid and I do not communicate any more as he
 is another control freak and tried a lot of underhand things, even when
 my father was alive.

 engineer was working on a secret contract for one of Europe's biggest 
defence companies

‘He 
tried to take control of my father’s assets and demanded control. Anyway
 it is a long story and now I have just had to wipe him out of my life.

‘Sad but I need to concentrate now on my wife and two lovely girls.’

It
 has also emerged that Saad was so angry about the will published after 
Kadhem Al-Hilli’s death in Spain last year that he made a legal 
application for it to be put on hold.

The ‘caveat’, a formal notice or 
warning, halted Zaid’s claim over their father’s estate while the 
dispute was resolved.

Detectives
 continue to hunt for a motive to the murder of Mr Al-Hilli, his wife, 
mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf, and a passing local cyclist in 
Chevaline, on Lake Annecy, last Wednesday.

Police
 in Sweden were last night preparing to enter the spacious Stockholm 
flat owned by the 74-year-old mother-in-law in the hope of finding 
further clues to the mystery.

The country’s secret service has been formally approached by the French police to begin assisting with the inquiry.

There
 was no sign of Zaid Al-Hilli yesterday at two properties linked to him 
in the Chessington and Walton-on-Thames areas of Surrey.

The former public relations executive, who denies any link to the killings, has been interviewed by detectives over the weekend.

A
 team of forensic experts continued to scour his brother’s £1million 
mock Tudor family home for clues in the leafy village of Claygate.

Firearms
 officers were called in at one point, carrying a large black holdall in
 and out of the house, prompting speculation a weapon had been found.

Police
 are preparing to interview other members of the family and business 
associates.

British police are acting on behalf of their French 
colleagues who face a mammoth task pulling together the threads of a 
huge and complex inquiry.

They
 have sent out an international request to police and security agencies 
asking for any information about the Al-Hilli family.

A
 team of four French police officers, led by the country’s most senior 
gendarmerie detective, Colonel Marc de Tarle, visited the Claygate 
property on Saturday.

They 
are also looking at Mr Al-Hilli’s professional life, including his work 
on defence projects for a high-tech satellite technology and imagery 
firm.

In Sweden, relatives 
of Mr Al-Hilli’s mother-in-law said they were shocked at the murder of 
the well-dressed retired English teacher.

Mrs Al-Allaf lived alone after
 the death of her husband in May and they said she ‘longed’ to spend 
more time with her daughter and grandchildren.

Last
 night her nephew, Hasan Ahmad Al-Saffar, 18, paid tribute to Mrs 
Al-Allaf and her ‘perfect family’. He said: ‘What has happened to them 
is so terrible, it’s almost impossible to talk about.

‘We
 had a lovely time together when they visited us a year ago. We took 
them around Stockholm to see the sights with the children, who were just
 two wonderful little girls.

‘Saad
 was a really loving father. He really took care of his daughters. Ikbal
 was a doting mother and the children were so well behaved.

‘We have no idea why this has happened or what led to it.

‘We can’t think of any reason for anything so horrible.

‘It’s been so shocking for us and everyone who knew them.’
