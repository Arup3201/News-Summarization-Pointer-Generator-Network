Sleepless nights are the bane of new parents and it seems that Zac Goldsmith and his wife Alice have had more than a few lately.

With his newborn baby safely tucked up in a carrycot and an exhausted smile on his face, Richmond MP Zac, 38, headed off to enjoy the sunshine in his eco-friendly car accompanied by Alice, 27, who wore a pretty pink striped vest and a comfortable pair of leggings.

The baby, who was born just four months after the couple's March wedding, is Mrs Goldsmith's first child, although Zac has three children - Uma Romaine, Thyra and James - from his previous marriage to Sheherazade Bentley.

The MP and environmental campaigner will have plenty of time to spend with his youngest child when Parliament breaks for summer next month, although some of that will probably be spent introducing his new baby to his or her three half-siblings.

Zac and his former wife divorced in 2010 amid rumours surrounding the MP and his current wife, who is the sister of Ben Goldsmith's former wife, Kate Rothschild.

The first Rothschild-Goldsmith marriage imploded spectacularly last year when Kate ran off with US rapper, Jay Electronica.

Ben, who is now dating PR girl, Jemima Jones, reacted furiously to the affair and the police were allegedly called to an altercation at the couple's West London home.

The couple put in an appearance at Lady Annabel Goldsmith's summer ball last week, where they were joined by Zac, Jemima Khan and a bevy of socialites including Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, at Ormely Lodge in southwest London.

Widow of Sir James Goldsmith and mother of Robin, India Jane, Jemima, Zac and Ben, Annabel is also grandmother to ten.

An extremely wealthy widow (her fortune is estimated at around Â£1.48 
billion), Lady Goldsmith was the darling of London's fashionable Clermont set in the1960s, which included Lord Lucan, Lord Lambton, Claus
von Bulow and Bobby Kennedy.

Attendees at this year's soiree included Bunter Somerset, The Marquess of Worcester and Prince Michael and Princess Michael of Kent.
