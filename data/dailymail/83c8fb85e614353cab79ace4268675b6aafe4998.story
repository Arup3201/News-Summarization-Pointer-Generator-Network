Osama bin Laden's relatives have bought the Carrara quarries to their collection

The quarry which produced the stone for London's Marble Arch and Michelangelo's masterpiece David has been bought by Osama Bin Laden's family for £35million.

The Al Qaeda chief, who died in 2011 at the hands of US Navy Seals, was one of 53 children of Mohammed Bin Laden - a Yemeni émigré who built up a vast commercial empire.

Now his relatives have added the Carrara quarries in Tuscany, which still produce the world's most sought after marble, to their collection of 26 mines.

The Bin Laden family now own 50 per cent of the company with permits to mine huge swathes of the quarries near Florence, the setting for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace.

Saudi Arabia's Construction Products Holding Company (CPC), part of the Bin Laden family's construction industry conglomerate, acquired the stakes of three Italian families on Wednesday, according to ANSA the Italian news agency. 

Oil rich Saudi Arabia is already one of the world’s biggest consumers of marble.

And it was the Bin Laden’s construction company that was awarded the contract to build the mosque at Mecca in the 1950s that houses Islam’s most holy shrine, using hundreds of tonnes of marble.

The family business is the third largest construction company in the world and was already a customer of the quarries.

Carrara which has been mined since Roman times, produces around £250million worth of stone every year employing 5,000 people.

The creamy white stone was valued by the Renaissance masters including da Vinci, who invented a cutting machine for use in the quarry, but later artists including Bernini and Rodin, who used it for his legendary sculpture The Kiss, have continued to demand it.

It is thought the Saudi moguls negotiated to buy out the shares of three Italian families for a reported 45 million euros.

The quarries, which have existed since Roman times, are a crucial economic asset at a time when Italy is struggling to lift itself out of recession shipping out 1.4 million tons a year, worth around €300 million (£250million) annually.
