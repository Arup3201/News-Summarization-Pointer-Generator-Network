Made of stern stuff: Private Craig Paterson grins in spite of his alarming injury as he recovers in Birmingham last July

A young soldier told today how he continued to fire his gun in a deadly shootout with the Taliban - despite being shot in the head.

Private Craig Paterson was three months into a tour in the troubled Helmand Province of Afghanistan last July when his unit was pinned down on a rooftop by an enemy sniper.

Pte Paterson, 22, was desperate to stay in the fight alongside his comrades and kept firing back, holding the enemy away from the building.

The soldier, from Inverurie, 
Aberdeenshire, said: 'We were on an operation and we had been dropped in
the middle of nowhere. I’m a sharp shooter so I was told to go onto the
roof of this building.

'Four
of us had been on the roof when fire started coming in and we were 
quickly pinned down. I can remember the bullets and mortars flying 
around my head.

'I knew
there was a sniper out there and I was looking for him. It happened 
very quickly - I put my head up and he got me.

'I can't remember much after I 
was shot. But I must have been determined to get the sniper as the guys 
said I continued firing at him, even though I was in and out of 
consciousness.'

Pte
Paterson eventually collapsed and lay 
helpless on the roof until a paramedic came to his rescue.

He added: 'The next time I woke up I
was in a hospital in Birmingham.'

The medic - nicknamed Mother by fellow soldiers of 4 Scots, the Royal Regiment of Scotland - shielded the stricken soldier with her body as they were sprayed with heavy gunfire and ricocheting bullets.

Royal Navy reservist Michelle Ping, 37, from Leeds, was later mentioned in dispatches in recognition of her gallantry.

He said: 'As soon as she saw my eyes she thought I was dead. But she told me she shouted at me "I’m not having that" and she shook me back to life and looked after me.

'I’m so grateful for what she did. She saved my life. We’re best of friends and she is coming up to Aberdeen next Friday to see me to see how I’m getting on.'

Pte Paterson suffered a brain injury as the bullet drove through a neat puncture in the front of his helmet and punched a large exit hole at the back.

He was then airlifted to Kandahar, where an American surgeon carried out a delicate operation on his head, removing a piece from the top of his skull and inserting a titanium plate held in place by 32 tiny screws.

Pte Paterson said: 'I now have a metal plate in my skull - although I have kept the piece of my skull in an envelope upstairs as a war souvenir.

'I’ve tested the metal plate to see if it magnetic, but it doesn’t seem to be. I don’t know yet what effect it may have on airport security metal detectors.'

After the operation in Kandahar, he spent three days in an induced coma before he was flown back to Britain.

He spent a month in a Birmingham hospital before being transferred to a military rehabilitation unit in Surrey for seven months, where he was told his stubborn Scottish nature helped his speedy recovery.

Giving back: Pte Paterson in the customised bike he will ride in a 510-mile challenge in aid of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association

Despite now having a severe weakness in the right side of his body, Craig is happy to be alive and wants to give back to the charities which helped save his life.

When the Highlander returned home a few weeks ago he immediately signed up to raise cash for the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association by doing a five-day, 510-mile Ride of Britain cycling event in September on a specially adapted bike.

He said: 'I have been getting in training around an Inverurie to Monymusk circuit. It’s another challenge but I’ll do it to help SSAFA continue their great work. It meant so much to us to be together.'
