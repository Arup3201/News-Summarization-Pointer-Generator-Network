A beauty queen who almost died three years ago when the plane carrying her new liver crashed, is set to enjoy a very merry Christmas after being told a third transplant has been a complete success.

Kate Trevener was just hours from death when the Cessna plane carrying the vital organ burst into a fireball after crashing in heavy fog as it came into land at Birmingham Airport.

Frail Kate, who was 18 at the time, had suffered acute liver failure when a donor organ was found in Northern Ireland on November 19, 2010.

hauled from the wreckage by fireman Nick Jordan who then risked his life
 again to pull the charred box which contained the liver to safety.

The
 box was strapped to a motorbike and police closed major roads during 
rush hour as it was raced to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

Incredibly, just 45 minutes after the plane crashed the liver was successfully transplanted into Kate.

But sadly Kate's ordeal was not yet over as her body rejected the organ just eight days after the life-saving operation.

A second liver transplant was rejected in 2012 before a third was found and she could finally get on with her life

A second liver transplant was rejected in 2012 before a third was found and she could finally get on with her life.

Now the 21-year-old former Miss Birmingham finalist has finally been told her third liver is a 'perfect match'.

Kate, from the Shard End area of Birmingham, can now celebrate the festive season without worrying about her health.

Yesterday
 Kate, who is pursuing a career in the bridal industry, said: 'Christmas
 is a really hard time for people on the transplant list, I've obviously
 been there myself.

'Everyone wants a materialistic present - you're just waiting for an organ.

'All you're thinking about is the family of the donor.

'That's a Christmas where they haven't got a family member but they know that person has saved someone else's life. That's a gift from them.

'It's comforting for them at such a hard time, I should think.

'You can really see how people get too wrapped up in Christmas and presents. They don't see the important things they should be thinking about.

'I had the biopsy two weeks ago to check everything was OK and they think I should go on now and everything should be fine.

'I'm going to try and take every opportunity that gets given to me.

'The results have made me realise I've got nothing holding me back now, whereas before I'd been thinking "what if something goes wrong?"'
