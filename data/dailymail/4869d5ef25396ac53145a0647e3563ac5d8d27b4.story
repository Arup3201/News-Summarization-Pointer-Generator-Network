President Barack Obama's hope of any movement on immigration reform in Congress died Tuesday night when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his Republican primary election.

Canter will resign his leadership post as of July 31, sources said Wednesday. And with him out he way out, the GOP's future House leadership picture has been thrown into chaos.

While political commentators and Democratic Party insiders have crowed that the populist right-wing tea party movement was on its last legs, the rumors of its death now appear to be greatly exaggerated.

Not so, however, for the prospects of passing an immigration reform measure into law. Virginia voters dug a grave for the idea on Tuesday night and kicked Democrats into it.

Cantor's appetite to inherit the gavel from House Speaker John Boehner was an open secret on Capitol Hill, and rumors have swirled about Boehner's desire to step down from that role.

But with the seven-term congressman's unexpected loss to Dave Brat, an economics professor so obscure that his Wikipedia entry was just two lines long on Monday, the Republican House leadership sweepstakes is wide open.

Crushed: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and his wife Diana left the stage in shock Tuesday night following his 56-44 loss to a political unknown who painted him as a fan of immigration 'amnesty'

Upset: Dave Brat rejoiced wth hundreds of supporters after beating Cantor on Tuesday in the 7th Congressional District in Virginia, in a race that has revitalized tea party Republicans

And
 less than 24 hours after the seismic shift in the GOP's power 
structure, the party's congressmen and women will have a closed-door 
meeting Wednesday afternoon to plan their next steps.

Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texan chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wednesday that he is 'prayerfully' considering whether to run for Cantor's job inside the GOP caucus.

'I am humbled by the many people who have approached me about serving our Republican Conference in a different capacity in the future,' Hensarling told National Journal in a statement.

'There are many ways to advance the causes of freedom and free enterprise, and I am prayerfully considering the best way I can serve in those efforts.'

Pete Sessions, another Texas Republican seen in tea party circles as far more moderate, is also considering a run.

If Boehner should relinquish the speaker's gavel, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan will be the front-runner, according to several House staffers with knowledge of discussions in the GOP caucus.

Cantor lost, in part, because he backed modest reforms to America's immigration policies. But his political-neophyte opponent, economics professor Dave Brat, painted him as an high octane Obama-style 'amnesty' advocate.

Cantor's zeal – and Obama's – to flood the U.S. with cheap labor from Mexico and Central America, Brat argued throughout the campaign, would depress wages for people in the district that stretches northwest from the state capitol of Richmond.

The tactic worked far better than any political observers predicted. And now the White House's hope of congressional action on immigration this year is all but dead.

Obama told a group of nurses on Monday. Alvin Viting, a 31-year-old registered nurse, told the Associated Press that the president said there was a 50-50 chance that the House would take action on immigration in the next month.

But politicos in Washington were writing off any hope of that on Wednesday morning.

'I think that was probably true prior to last night,' one source who is close to the GOP leadership told MailOnline of Obama's prediction. 'And now I think that the odds of that happening are very, very low.'

Another said in an email that 'immigration reform was never very likely anyway, but this was probably the [final] nail in the coffin.'

Cantor would have been the Majority Leader in the House until January had he not resigned earlier today.

A Capitol Hill insider with close ties to the leadership office told MailOnline that Cantor suddenly 'lost a lot of power' after last night's defeat, which would have made it hard for him to continue in a leadership role.

'My gosh, how is he going to get anyone to vote for this now?' the insider said, referring to immigration reform.

A third source, a senior aide to a Republican senator, told MailOnline on Wednesday that GOP leaders on that side of the Capitol are 'actually relieved.'

Senate Democrats passed Obama's preferred immigration bill in June 2013 with the help of 14 more moderate Republicans, but it 'left a sour taste in the conservative wing's mouth,' he said.

'Now everyone gets to take a deep breath, knowing that the whole thing is dead in the House. Until Cantor lost, that was an open question.'

The Senate bill would give green cards – work permits – to illegal immigrants and start them on a lengthy 13-year path to citizenship. But that would only happen after the government deploys 20,000 additional border agents, mandates a system to prevent businesses from hiring unauthorized people and finishes a new 700-mile fence on the southern border.

Senate Democrats are still hoping against hope that the legislation could get a hearing in the House. They're painting Cantor as an opponent of immigration reform, not as one of its champions – which is the image that earned him a crushing double-digit defeat on Tuesday.

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called Cantor the 'last major obstacle to immigration reform' on Wednesday, and warned on the Senate floor that the Republican party will lose control of the House if it doesn't come to heel.

That possibility is near zero, however: The GOP is set to gain seats in November, and possibly retake the Senate from Schumer and his fellow Democrats.

Cantor's district spanned urban Richmond and rural counties, areas where unemployment runs high and Dave Brat was able to argue that increased immigration would make jobs more scarce and depress wages

Senate left-wingers did have one reason to be hopeful on Tuesday, however: South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has earned the moniker 'Graham-nesty' for his support of some immigration reform planks, won his primary contest easily.

But that was in a statewide race, a broader kind of contest that usually mutes the impact of the sort of grassroots organizers who doomed Cantor in his smaller district.

'Eric Cantor's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP establishment,' conservative icon Brent Bozell said. 'The grassroots is in revolt and marching.'

Bozell is chairman of ForAmerica, an organization that has targeted moderate Republicans, including Cantor, and promoted more conservative candidates who are often tea party darlings.

Still, the White House is casting Graham's victory as a sign that immigration reform advocates will ultimately have the upper hand in Congress.

'Cantor’s problem wasn't his position on immigration reform,' tweeter Obama senior aide Dan Pfeiffer. 'It was his lack of a position. Graham wrote and passed a bill and is winning big.'

Speaker Boehner has never tipped his hand on the substance of immigration reform proposals, but he has said he favored holding a vote on the issue and mocked his fellow Republicans for their reluctance.

'Here's the attitude: "Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too hard",' Boehner told reporters in April, doing an impression of his Congressional caucus while squealing like a child.'We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and it's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues ... take the path of least resistance,' Boehner continued.

Boehner has since reiterated that Obama's 'all or nothing' approach to immigration is off the table.

Dave Brat, right, defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary on Tuesday, marking one of the most improbable American political victories in the history of party primaries

In addition to the 'amnesty' albatross aroudn his neck, Cantor shot himself in the foot by ignoring the ordinary needs of his constituents, according to two Virginia Republican Party officials who spoke to MailOnline.

'He just wasn't around anymore, not since he took a leadership role in the House,' said one, jumping on the bash-Cantor bandwagon.

'He turned into a jet-setter, when what we needed was a handyman to fix normal stuff that middle-class people care about.'

Playbook, the influential daily email service from Politico, noted a gossiped reaction of another knowledgeable insider: 'Cantor spent too much time on the road and in the Hamptons.'

He also whiled away his afternoons in the K Street lobbying corridor, according to RedState.com editor Erik Erickson.

'Cantor's constituent services moved more toward focusing on running the Republican House majority than his congressional district,' Erickson wrote.

'K Street, the den of Washington lobbyists, became his chief constituency. ... He kept his attention off his district, constituents, and conservatives while he and his staff plotted to get the Speaker’s chair.'
