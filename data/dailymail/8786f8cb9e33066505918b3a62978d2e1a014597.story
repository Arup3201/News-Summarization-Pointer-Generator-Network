A man and a woman arrested over the death of a six-year-old girl at a family campsite in the New Forest were last night released without charge.

The girl had been camping with her parents when she had a fit and collapsed in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Police have said they are no longer treating the death as suspicious and have described it as nothing but a 'tragic accident'.

Investigation: Forensic officers at the tent where the little girl was discovered

Ambulance crews arrived to find the child's horrified mother and father desperately trying to revive her with CPR.

Police reached the site, in Bransgore, Hampshire, 40 minutes later and arrested a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman from Gosport, Hampshire, on suspicion of murder but later released them without charge.

The campsite was the scene of intense police activity all day as scene 
of crime officers examined the family-sized tent the girl was staying 
in.

Investigations will now continue to find out exact circumstances of the death.

It is not known whether the pair arrested were related to the youngster, but it is understood she was camping in a group of four tents with several families.

The girl, who has not been identified, was pronounced dead on arrival at Southampton General Hospital after going into cardiac arrest.

The 600-pitch four-acre campsite is set on an old Second World War airfield and advertises itself as ‘ideal for families’.

One witness, who did not want to be named, said she was woken by the 
sound of screams and someone repeatedly pressing a car horn before 
police and paramedics arrived at the scene.

The death has left the mood at the campsite very sombre with many 
campers hoping to enjoy the Easter break deciding to leave early.

The Camping and Caravanning Club's director general Robert Louden said: 
'We were saddened to hear the tragic news earlier today and have since 
been assisting the police with their ongoing investigations.

'On behalf of the club I would personally like to thank our holiday site
managers, assistants and campers on site at Holmsley for their full 
co-operation and compassion, and our thoughts are very much with the 
little girl's family and friends at this difficult time.'

The campsite hopes to reopen on Sunday for new arrivals and police will 
remain in the vicinity for the next 24 hours to reassure visitors to the
site and the local community

The identification of the youngster is now expected to be released by police in the coming days.

A Hampshire Police spokesman said: ‘The results of a post-mortem examination have indicated that there are no suspicious circumstances.

‘The arrests made this morning were necessary as a result  of a report from experienced medical professionals.

‘The girl’s death is no longer being treated as suspicious but a tragic incident. An investigation into the cause of the girl’s death is ongoing.

'As with all investigations into the death of a child we will now be working with partner agencies to support the family throughout the investigation process.'

Gathering clues: Police carry out their investigations at the site

Inquiries underway: Reports suggest the girl suffered a cardiac arrest in an incident which police are treating as suspicious

Mystery: An officer conducts inquiries with other campers at the site as police try to establish what led to the girl's cardiac arrest. Her parents are believed to have made desperate attempts to resuscitate their daughter at the scene
