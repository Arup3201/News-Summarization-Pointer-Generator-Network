Phuket, Melbourne, Bicester... Do you really know how to pronounce these places?

It seems there are some place names that even the most well-travelled of us fail to say correctly, some exotic, some closer to home. 

Who knew that the correct way to say Dubai was 'Du-bay'? Or that the best way to say Bangkok is 'Bahg-gawk'?

John Wells, Professor of Phonetics at University College London and author of Sounds Interesting Observations on English and General Phonetics, told Mail Online Travel: 'The problems derive mainly from the opaqueness of English spelling, which does not enable us to predict pronunciation with any certainty, and also from people's disinclination to study foreign languages.'

Here are the place names we're most guilty of pronouncing wrong...

Consider yourself well travelled and worldly-wise? How would you pronounce these place names?

PHUKET, THAILAND 

Not one you want to get wrong. The 'ph' is actually pronounced 'p' rather than 'f', while the hard 'k' is more like a 'g' sound. For an English tongue 'pu-get' is about as close as you will get to the proper pronunciation. 

BANGKOK 

Thailand's capital city is a popular haunt for Britons abroad, but how many are pronouncing it correctly? The 'a' is more of an 'ah' sound, while the 'k' is harder, again, like a 'g' and the 'o' should be said 'aw', making the correct pronunciation more like "Bahng-gawk".

The stunning Thai island of Phuket is a favourite with holidaymakers, but do we pronounce it correctly?

MELBOURNE

Australia may be one of our favourite long-haul destinations, but it seems we can't pronounce one of their most famous cities. Melbourne, often pronounced 'Mel-born' is called 'melb'n' by the folks who live there. And while we're at it, let's get Brisbane right too, it is pronounced 'brisb'n'.

BICESTER  

Fancy a bargain? Head to Bicester Village, an oasis of budget shopping in one of Oxfordshire's fastest growing towns. That's 'Biss-ter' to you and me.

OAXACA, MEXICO 

Don't be fooled by the X, the way to say this beautiful Mexican state, is 'Wah-ha-ca'. Yes, just like the Thomasina Miers Mexican restaurant chain. She clearly couldn't trust us to pronounce the name correctly without a phonetic spelling to help us out.

If you want to enjoy the delights of Australia's cultural hub Melbourne, make sure you also pronounce it the way the locals do

The former British colony of Dominica in the West Indies is pronounced 'dommi-neeka'

WORCESTERSHIRE

The West Midlands county of Worcestershire has plenty to offer visitors, from beautiful Ragley Hall to the National Trust's Brockhampton Estate, a late 14th-century moated manor house.

But first you'll need to be able to tell people where you are going. It may be tempting to pronounce all English counties ending in 'shire' as if you are a Hobbit, but it is actually a softer 'sheer' pronunciation you need. 

Now for Worcester. Forget the 'r' and the 'c' and instead blend the word to say 'wuster'. And so you have the county 'wustersheer'. 

A recent survey revealed that 82 per cent of us regularly trip over our words.

And place names can be particularly confusing, according to the study commissioned by London railway station St Pancras International, which is itself frequently mispronounced by 33 per cent of people to sound like the gland 'pancreas'. 

It found the Cambridgeshire city of 'Ely' is the most commonly mispronounced word, with more than half of Brits (59 per cent) getting it wrong (it's pronounced 'ee-lee' not 'ee-lie'.

And one in six (16 per cent) speakers do not pronounce the south-east London district of 'Greenwich' correctly. It should be pronounced 'gren-ich', not as it is seen. 

KINGUSSIE 

A small but lively Highland town right in Cairngorms National Park in Scotland, it sits beside the river Spey and is surrounded by spectacular scenery. But just make sure that if you're heading that way, you say 'king-yoossie', not 'kin-gussie'.

BLOEMFONTEIN 

The capital of Free State Province in South Africa and famed as the 'city of roses', Bloemfontein is often a stop-off for travellers crossing the country thanks to its handy central location. But if you're heading that way, ask for directions to 'bloom-fontayn', not 'blohm-fon-tyne'. 

Are you getting Colombia, home to the beautiful city of Cartagena, confused with US university Columbia?

DOMINICA  

Dominica, the former British Colony in the West Indies, is famed as an untouched corner of the Caribbean with beautiful scenery and amazing walks. And it's pronounced 'dommi-neeka', not 'do-MINNika'.

COLOMBIA

Not to be confused with top New York University, Columbia, the South American country is actually pronounced 'Col-ombia' rather than 'Columbia'.  

Beautifu Budapest is famous for its Ottoman heritage and for straddling the Danube... and it is pronounced 'buda-pesht'

BUDAPEST

It is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, split down the middle as it straddles the Danube but connected through a series of elegant bridges.

But If you've been pronouncing it phonetically as you read the word, you've been doing it wrong - The Hungarian capital is actually pronounced 'Booda-Pesht'.  

HOLBORN 

If you are in London and heading to the British Museum, you'll be viisting the London borough of Holborn. It's well worth it.

But if you're asking for directions on the Tube, forget the 'l' - this area of the capital, also famous for De Lane Lea recording studios and Holborn Bars, is actually pronounced 'Ho-burn'.
