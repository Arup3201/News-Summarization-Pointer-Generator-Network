When these two violent thugs were jailed, their victims must have felt  some sense of relief that  they were behind bars and being punished.

The pictures here, however, tell a very different story – because they were actually taken in their cell and posted on Facebook so they could boast about their ‘easy life’ inside.

Behind the pair a PlayStation 2 can be seen, as well as a television that is showing a music channel. Other pictures appear to show a cell filled with a mini-fridge, sound system, piles of snacks and posters of topless glamour models.

'Easy': Sonny Barker, seen left posing with his cellmate Korrel Kennedy, has been posting pictures of his 'easy' life behind bars on Facebook

Sonny Barker, 20, was jailed  for 
eight years after he held  a mother and daughter at knifepoint in their 
home during a burglary. But the serial offender smuggled a phone into 
his cell at HMP Rochester in Kent to show off his cushy surroundings.

In the pictures posted on his 
Facebook account, he poses with cellmate Korrel Kennedy, 20, a former 
Jean Paul Gaultier model, who was jailed for chasing a  man with a knife
and threatening hospital staff.

In his first post on Facebook on June
29, Barker wrote: ‘What’s happening! Coming from live from prison. Whos
(sic) missing me.’  He added: ‘I’ll be home soon. Real soon December 
2015.’

'On smash': The 20-year-old, who was jailed for eight years for holding a mother and daughter at knifepoint, has been posting pictures taken on a BlackBerry to Facebook

When one friend wrote he had ‘it on 
smash’ – prison slang for living an easy life inside – he replied: ‘When
haven’t I had it on smash? Admit it, been bossing since  Elmley 
[Prison].’ 

Steve Gillan, general secretary of 
the Prison Officers’ Association,   said he was ‘extremely concerned’ 
about the pictures and boasts. ‘It is nothing short of scandalous and a 
breach of security,’ he added.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘Serious questions need to be asked of the prison 
authorities to establish how this was able to happen.’ Barker, from 
Canterbury, was jailed in May last year after he burst into a family 
home last February wearing a balaclava and held a knife to a woman’s 
face and then to the stomach of her 16-year-old daughter. The court 
heard he already had 24 convictions dating back to 2008.

Vain: Barker, seen right, said in a Facebook post he had been 'bossing since Elmley' - a reference to another prison

'Scandalous': The Prison Officers' Association said it was 'extremely concerned' that inmates had been able to smuggle phones into their cells

Kennedy was once described as 
‘Britain’s worst teen’, but was given a chance to mend his ways and 
modelled for Jean Paul Gaultier on the catwalk at Paris Men’s Fashion 
Week. But in 2011 he was jailed for two and a half years after chasing a
man with a knife in Brighton city centre and threatening staff at a 
local hospital. 

HMP Rochester is a category-C young 
offender institution for 650 male offenders deemed untrustworthy and 
likely to try to escape. Past inspections have found evidence of 
bullying and a Fight Club-style culture in the prison.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘It 
is a criminal offence to have a mobile phone in prison and any prisoner 
found with one will be dealt with severely.’
