Another week, another photoshoot! Although my work can get pretty hectic at times, I do love being on the go, and I was particularly excited for this shoot as it was for my nail polish range Binky London.

As summer is sadly on the way out, I've been thinking about launching my Autumn/Winter shades soon, replacing cute pastels and beachy brights with deep berry hues, neutral greys and smouldering metallics. The new collection will be out very soon so keep an eye out!

For the shoot, I enlisted the slick skills of expert make-up artist Buster Knight, who was responsible for the super-glam look I wore in Stacey Jackson's Dance The Night Away music video.

Glam: This week Binky has been on set shooting her latest campaign for her nail collection - Binky London 

Buster created a soft and natural look for this shoot featuring a warm golden smokey eye, a structured lip and a beach-bronzed bod. I was delighted with the results, so thought I'd share with you how he did it:

THE FACE

A foundation with good coverage is a photoshoot essential, so Buster began by applying DiorSkin Forever Foundation to my face with the Real Techniques Buffing Brush, buffing and blending so the product merged seamlessly with my skin.

After setting the base with powder, Buster used the classic Guerlain Terracotta Bronzing Powder to define my cheekbones and warm up my face.

THE EYES

For the shoot, Buster put a summery twist on my all-time beauty fave, the smokey eye. Instead of using harsh greys and blacks, he opted for warmer golden, coppery tones, using the gorgeous Guerlain 6 Couleurs Eye Palette in Francs-Bourgeois.

He swept a light base colour all over my lid, before taking a warm brown colour across my lash line, winging it slightly towards the end. Next, he took the shimmery copper shade and lightly patted it all over my lash line, again focusing on the outer corners.

The perfect smokey eye presents a sexy, slightly 'worn-in' look, so there's no need to be too precise with application. Do make sure you blend each new shade into the eye well with a blending brush, though, to avoid the result looking patchy.

Finally, Buster lined my upper and lower lash lines with the Clarins Crayon Kohl Long Lasting Eye Pencil in Bronze, smudging the product in slightly with a small eye brush. Lashings of Too Faced Size Queen Mascara finished off the eyes.

Diet success: Binky said that she was feeling body confident on the shoot following her recent weight loss

THE LIPS

Buster lined my lips first with the Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Lip Liner in Taffy, applying the pencil in gentle brush strokes just outside the lip line to create the illusion of fuller lips.

He then filled my lips in with DHC Premium Lipstick in First Blush – a slightly lighter shade – for a structured yet natural looking pout.

THE BODY

I was feeling pretty body confident before the shoot – I did indulge slightly in New York (I'm only human!) but managed to keep my dieting under control by taking Forza Raspberry K2 Supplements every day, so was more than happy to get my pins out on the day.

Buster applied Rimmel Sunshimmer Instant Tanning Lotion over my arms, legs and décolletage using a body brush for an all-over beach babe bronzed glow. 

As a final touch, he spritzed some of the Michael Kors Liquid Shimmer Dry Oil Spray down the front of my legs and along my collarbones. This luxurious oil gives the body a luminous, subtle shimmer, enveloping it with its gorgeous orange and jasmine flower scent.

You can get all the products Buster used on the shoot, as well as my Binky London nail polishes, from Escentual.com.

Smooth operator: Binky recommends using a dry oil to make legs shimmer while the sun's still out 

I also wanted share with you some exciting news about the August GLOSSYBOX. It's GLOSSYBOX's third global anniversary, so to celebrate three years providing luxury treats to beauty junkies like me worldwide, they've given their iconic pink box a subtle makeover and filled it with some super special goodies including a bespoke Kryolan Illuminator created exclusively for GLOSSYBOX!

Treasure chest: As a beauty junkie, Binky can't get enough of GLOSSYBOX 

My top pick from the August Birthday GLOSSYBOX has to be Philip Kingsley Elasticiser – this hair mask is a complete godsend, giving dry, lifeless hair lustrous strength and shine. 

I leave it on overnight before shampooing and conditioning my hair as normal the next morning. I also adore the Lalique L'Amour fragrance – a must if you're a fan of soft, floral scents, plus the handy size makes it perfect to take on a night out.

You can get your mitts on the August Birthday Glossybox for just £10 (+P&P) from www.glossybox.co.uk throughout the whole of August 2014.

Until next time,

Binky xxx
