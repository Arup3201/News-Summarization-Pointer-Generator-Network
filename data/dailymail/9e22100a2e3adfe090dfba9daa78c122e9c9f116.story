On trial: Eddy Shah is accused of repeatedly raping a teenage girl in luxury hotels

A teenager was asked to have Eddy Shah's baby after she was repeatedly raped by the newspaper tycoon, a court heard today.

Shah is alleged to have had sex with the girl in luxury London hotels after paying a prostitute £650 to get access to her.

Today the apparent victim, who says she was just 14 when the abuse began, testified that the escort told her she should get pregnant with Shah's child in order to get money from the businessman.

The Old Bailey has previously heard that Susan Davies, 53, forced the girl to have sex with Shah, 69, and engage in threesomes with both of them.

'There was a time when she put it to me that I could have Eddy Shah's baby,' the alleged victim, who is now 34, told the court. 'She said that she could come up with the readies.'

Asked if she wanted to have the child, the woman said: 'No. I ignored it. I never, never tried to get any financial gain out of having sex with him.'

She said she suspected that Shah had subsequently fathered a daughter with Davies.

'She looks the spitting image of him,' she said. 'You only have to look at a photo.'

Davies also has a child by Tony Pallant, who is also on trial as the woman says he repeatedly raped her around the same time.

The court heard Shah wanted to have sex with the girl on his own, but Davies always insisted on being there and even on taking part.

'She told me that Eddy Shah wanted to see me on my own but Davies was not going to let me see him on my own,' said the woman.

'I felt very guilty because it happened with more than one man. The secret became a more dreadful secret.'

The court heard yesterday that Davies had 'sold' the teenager to Shah for £650 in order to pay off her credit card debts.

She says he attacked her at least eight times in his suites at five-star hotels such as the Dorchester.

Shah, who is charged under his real name Selim Shah, ran the now-defunct Today newspaper and was best known for bringing in new technology and colour printing.

He, Davies and Pallant are charged with 13 separate sex attacks on the girl between 1991 and 1995, all of which they deny.

The trial continues.
