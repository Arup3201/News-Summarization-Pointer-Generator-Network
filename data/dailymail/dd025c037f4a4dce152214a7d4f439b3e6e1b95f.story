When the Chinese premier visited London this week he was greeted with an honour guard, a Downing Street reception and a meeting with the Queen.

But one aspect of Li Keqiang’s welcome fell somewhat short in the eyes of Chinese officials – the red carpet rolled out for his arrival at Heathrow.

After plans for Mr Li’s visit were shown to the Beijing government, aides complained that the carpet leading from the steps of his plane was not long enough.

‘They saw a diagram of the arrangements at Heathrow and complained that the carpet was three metres too short,’ said one of the visit organisers.

The objection was raised with Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, but he is said to have told the Chinese official he had other things to worry about.

‘He said that he was sure the carpet would meet their requirements,’ the visit organiser told the Financial Times.

Mr Li is said to have demanded to meet the Queen, who welcomed him to Windsor Castle, despite the fact that it is relatively unusual for her to receive world leaders who are not heads of state.

During the visit, she welcomed him to Windsor Castle where they were joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room.

Later he went to Downing Street for lunch with the Prime Minister and business leaders where he was served a Chinese-themed menu including claypot chicken in a savoury sauce with shiitake mushrooms.

One of China’s Communist-controlled newspapers was said to be so angry about the furore about whether Mr Li would be hosted by the Queen that it wrote an editorial in which it called Britain an ‘old, declining empire’ that resorts to ‘eccentric acts’ to cover its waning importance.

China’s Foreign Ministry yesterday played down the diplomatic row over the length of the red carpet.

A spokesman said: ‘The British side closely co-ordinated with the Chinese side in the reception organisation and visit results, took the initiative in making considerate arrangements and made great efforts to ensure the full success of Premier Li’s visit. The Chinese side expresses its appreciation.’

The demanding requirement was perhaps surprising considering in December 2012 the current Chinese administration banned red carpets, welcome banners, floral arrangements and grand receptions for Chinese officials travelling domestically on official business.

Regulations introduced also told officials travelling overseas to restrict the size of their delegations and avoid large receptions at the airport on their arrival.
