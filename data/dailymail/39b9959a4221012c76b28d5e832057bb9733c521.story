Jose Mourinho won the first trophy of his second spell in charge at Chelsea - then immediately rang his wife at the final whistle to tell her the news.

Mourinho completed a special day with a 2-0 Capital One Cup final win over Spurs coming a few hours after his side’s Premier League title rivals Manchester City had lost 2-1 at Liverpool.

But as his players celebrated, the Chelsea boss was more concerned at telling his other half Matilde Faria who was waiting at home.

Mourinho rang his wife immediately after the match to inform her of the good news that Chelsea won

‘I rang my wife,’ an emotional Mourinho explained. ‘She didn’t know the result. I had my son and my daughter here, but my wife was at home and didn’t know the score until I called.’

Mourinho, who was winning his seventh trophy with Chelsea and the 21st of a remarkable career, admitted lifting the League Cup made him feel like a kid again.

‘For me, it’s important to feel that I’m a kid,’ he said. ‘Before the game I had the same feelings as my first final however many years ago.

‘It’s important to feel the same happiness after the victory, and to feel a kid at 52-years-old. ‘I know I have a team to build, which is what we’re doing, but it’s difficult for me to live without titles, even with all the work that we are doing to be stable. I need to feed myself with titles.

‘In this country it’s much more difficult to win than in my first period.’

Mourinho stopped his players from reacting to City’s defeat against Liverpool so they could concentrate fully on the Wembley final.

He said: ’I prepared the players for an impossible mission, which was not knowing the City result. Forget City. I knew that was an impossible mission, but I didn’t want the television on in the hotel or on the bus.

‘I told them I didn’t want any kind of manifestation or disappointment if City scored in the last minute, or Liverpool won. I wanted complete silence. We were successful on that.

‘But one member of my staff, Silvinho, jumped up in the bus. I wanted to kill the guy. He broke the rule.’

Nemanja Matic, suspended for the final, then gave the pre-match speech to his team-mates.

‘He made the speech in the dressing room expressing his pain not to be playing, and asking the players to express the pleasure he couldn’t have to play this final,’ Mourinho revealed.

Kurt Zouma was chosen as Matic’s replacement and played alongside Ramires in defensive midfield. Mourinho called him ‘our new Marcel Desailly’ and added: ‘We were preparing a bit, now and again, in some exercises for him to play that role in an emergency, and the kid did a fantastic job for us.’
