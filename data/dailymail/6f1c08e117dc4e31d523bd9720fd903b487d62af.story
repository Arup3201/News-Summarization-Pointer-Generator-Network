An Adelaide man has been accused of having sex with at least seven young children

An Australian man has been charged with 'horrific' sex crimes against at least seven, preschool-aged children at a government-run childcare centre where he worked.

Police, who have labelled the crimes 'disturbing, abhorrent and horrifying,' allege the 32-year-old engaged in sexual intercourse with at lease seven children and operated a highly-sophisticated sex racket distributing and producing more than 100,000 still images and 600 video files of child exploitation material.

The man, who cannot be identified, was a government employee at a residential facility when he allegedly committed the crimes during an 18-month period back in 2011-2012. He also cared for children outside of school hours, police said.

South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill has ordered a State Government Royal Commission into the alleged sexual abuse of children at a government-run residential care facility

Assistant Crime Commissioner Paul Dickson described the crimes as 'abhorrent' and said priority counselling is being given to affected families due to the disturbing nature of the case.

'As a police officer and as a father I am abhorred by these crimes,' he said.

'This investigation can best be described as horrific — horrific for the victims and their families and a terrible task for the police who have worked tirelessly to review these images.'

He said the investigation will remain a priority for police, purely due to the complexity and enormity of the data yet to be analysed.

'It may take many months to complete.'

Premier Jay Weatherill said the allegations point to 'unspeakable acts of evil' against children and could prompt a Royal Commission.

'This is unprecedented in possibly South Australia's or the nation's history,' he said.

'These were some of our most vulnerable children. We have to review everything.'

Employed by Families SA, the crimes leveled against the man are alleged to have been committed during an 18-month period between mid-2011 and the end of 2012.

Police searched the man's house in June, uncovering evidence of 'contact offending' and child exploitation material after receiving a tip-off that he was involved in the production and distribution of child pornography.

Families SA deputy chief executive David Waterford said the accused man had undergone rigorous working with children assessment

Detectives have analysed more than 100,000 still images and 600 video files during their investigation which could take months to investigate

Families SA deputy chief executive David Waterford said the accused man had undergone rigorous working with children assessment before being employed and had background checks every three years.

He described the alleged crimes as 'disturbing and horrifying' and said the department would ensure all families were notified.

The accused is due to appear before the Adelaide Magistrates Court on August 19.

Concerned parents and carers should call a Government hotline on 1800 659 572.
