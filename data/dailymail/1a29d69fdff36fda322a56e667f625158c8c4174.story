Playing in the Europa League is no excuse for poor domestic form, claims Everton boss Roberto Martinez.

The Toffees had to travel to Russia on Thursday to play FC Krasnodar in what turned out to be a 4000-mile round trip, but the Spaniard insists they cannot use that as an excuse for their performances in the Premier League.

When asked if Everton were tired after facing FC Krasnodar, Martinez said: ‘I’m not interested in that, at all. We enjoyed a very good trip, a very good experience.

'We worked very hard to get there last season, and the squad is ready. It’s not a case of too many games, we welcome that. The Europa League is pushing the squad and it will make us better.'

Everton face Manchester United after their Europa League exploits; it's a fixture they won last season and Martinez is looking forward to it.

‘Coming to Old Trafford is one of the most glamorous places to come in the Premier League and we are ready,' he said. 'We’re looking forward to facing one of the best teams in this competition.’ 

The former Swansea boss also expressed his delight at his side's comeback against rivals Liverpool last weekend.

He said: 'In football, there are many aspects, but one that is very important is character and never giving up. We were rewarded (against Liverpool) because we never gave up.’
