America’s newest soccer hero is a German-born 21-year-old who wasn’t expected to take part in Monday's night but who claims he knew he was destined for glory after dreaming about it two nights before.

John Brooks got the American soccer team’s World Cup off to a flying start after coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring an 86th minute winner from a corner.

The goal means he is the first American sub to ever score in a World Cup match and afterwards he revealed that he’d had a premonition that his big moment was about to arrive.

America's newest soccer hero, John Brooks, is a German-born 21-year-old who wasn't expected to take part in Monday's night but who claims he knew he was destined for glory after dreaming about it

Brooks was born in Berlin, his father was a American serviceman father from Chicago and his mom is German

‘I told some teammates that I dreamed that I scored in the 80th minute and we won the game,’ he said afterwards. ‘And now it was the 86th minute and we won.’

One of the surprise picks by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, Brooks hadn't been in the starting lineup for the World Cup opener against Ghana.

But after central defender Matt Besler felt tightness in his right hamstring during the final five minutes of the first half, Klinsmann sent the 21-year-old Brooks on for the start of the second half.

Just four minutes after Andre Ayew's 82nd-minute goal wiped out a lead Clint Dempsey had given the U.S. just 29 seconds in, Brooks outjumped Ghana's John Boye to meet Graham Zusi's corner kick and bounced an 8-yard header past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey.

Overcome with emotion, Brooks ran in disbelief, slumped to the ground arms first and felt teammates pile onto him. When they finally moved off, he put both hands to his lips and blew a kiss.

Two nights earlier he had dreamed about scoring a header from a corner kick.

'It was unbelievable,' Brooks said. 'I couldn't believe it.'

Brooks, was born in Berlin to a German mother and an American serviceman father from Chicago. The 6ft 4in central defender plays club soccer for his hometown club Hertha Berlin.

Brooks has only visited the U.S. for training camps and vacation, but has a tattoos of Berlin and Illinois on his arms. Speaking one day in California last month, he said, ‘When I'm here, I'm a full American. I play with heart for America.’

He had nerves initially Monday, yet is thrilled with how things ended.

‘I think the first goal was perfect, a perfect start. Couldn't be better,’ Brooks said.

Brooks' moment in the spotlight ensured that after the match his name was trending on Twitter and one over enthusiastic fan updated his Wikipedia entry to read: 'After scoring against Ghana... he is now among the ranks of John F. Kennedy, Chuck Norris and Abe Lincoln as American heroes.’ The comment has since been deleted.

As the American Outlaws chanted their way out of the stadium, Brooks missed the chance to meet Vice President Joe Biden when he visited the locker room. Brooks and Jermaine Jones had been chosen for random drug tests.

Among the five German-Americans on the 23-man roster, Brooks made his national team debut last August and had only four appearances entering the World Cup.

Nearly two hours after the final whistle, Brooks was among the last U.S. players to leave the locker room. Someone asked whether he thinks he will start against Portugal on Sunday.

‘I don't expect anything,’ he said. ‘I just give my best in every training session, and we'll see.’
