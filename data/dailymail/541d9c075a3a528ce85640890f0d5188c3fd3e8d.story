Rainbow loom bands have assumed a universal appeal far beyond the wildest dreams of the craze’s creator, Malaysia-born Cheong Choon Ng, 45.

Four years ago Ng was trying to make rubber-band bracelets with his daughters Teresa, now 16, and Michelle, 13, when he realized his fingers were too big to manipulate the bands.

So, the automotive crash-test engineer set about creating a tool that would help him do the job. He made a small loom with pins stuck in a piece of wood so he could play along, too.

The travel-size Finger Loom, which comes out on Wednesday, is a new product which Ng hopes will sustain his business' incredible growth 

Inspired by his ad-hoc creation, Ng, an engineer, developed a plastic version and patented it, spending $10,000 of the family’s savings to get it made cheaply in China.

By summer 2011, he was selling kits for $15 (£10) under the name of Rainbow Loom. Each comprised a small plastic loom - measuring 2in by 8in - a crochet hook and 600 multi-colored mini-rubber bands.

But many toy shops were unwilling to stock them. Ng didn’t find his first customer until the summer of 2012 when an American franchise called Learning Express Toys ordered 24 looms. They sold out within two days and his business took off.

Headquartered in an industrial park in Wixom, Michigan, Ng's company, called Choon's Design, has since sold over 8 million units worldwide and 40 million packs of rubber bands. Ng’s company is now worth more than $130 million.

When the Duchess of Cambridge was pictured in April wearing a red and pink bracelet given to her by a young girl during the royal tour of Australia, sales soared by 300 per cent. 

Prince William even accessorized his smart navy suit with a turquoise and black version in June.

Other famous people photographed wearing the bands include David Beckham, One Direction's Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus and even The Pope.

But Ng is aware the toy business is fickle and that the popularity of the Rainbow Loom could fade.

That's why he's introducing new products, such as the travel-size Finger Loom, which comes out on Wednesday.

He's also fine-tuning the original and trying to drum up interest overseas with plans for expansion in Germany and Japan.

In addition to jewelry, loom bands can be used to create various accessories and toys, including key rings, phone cases and even shoes.

Anna Protherough, senior buyer for children at Hobbycraft said: 'The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon.

'We began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been flying off our shelves.'

However, in light of the craze, medical professionals have raised concerns about the safety of the bands.

It comes after a number of children were harmed playing with genuine loom bands, including one boy who nearly lost two fingers after the bands wrapped tightly around them and another who was left blinded when one hit him in the eye.

While genuine loom bands contain acceptable levels of phthalates – which is 0.1 per cent by weight in the UK and U.S – several counterfeit products, predominantly charms to attach to the bands, have emerged with far higher levels of the chemicals.

Tests by the Assay Office in Birmingham found some batches of charms heading for British shelves contained as much as 50 per cent of phthalates.

The rise of counterfeits has even prompted Rainbow Looms to issue a warning about fake products.

The firm which started the craze said: Tthere are many fake/counterfeit Rainbow Loom products available online and at stores.

'Some fake products possess the same name as genuine Rainbow Loom products but these counterfeit products are unsafe for children and have not been tested in accordance with U.S. Toy Safety Standards (may contain lead and other dangerous substances).'

It also warned that products could be of inferior in quality.
