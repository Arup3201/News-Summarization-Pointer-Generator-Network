'I know it! I know it! I totally know it! Scripps National Spelling Bee finalist Jacob Williamson shrieked after drawing the word 'kabaragoya' Thursday night.

With only seven contestants remaining on the stage, a visibly excited Williamson, 15, proceeded to incorrectly spell out the name of a large lizard from Southeast Asia: c-a-b-a-r-a-g-o-y-a.  

Williams, a home-schooled boy from 
Bonita Springs, Florida, who has become a viral sensation thanks to his
 over-the-top spelling bee celebrations, was so confident he knew the 
word that he did not even bother to ask for the language of origin, 
definition or alternative spelling.

Too soon: Scripps National Spelling Bee finalist Jacob Williamson, 15, beamed when faced with the word 'kabaragoya,' which he was curtain he knew how to spell

Oops: Jacob cried out, 'WHAT?!' upon learning he got the spelling wrong by a single letter

S-a-d: The young speller appeared crestfallen as he trudged off the stage after being eliminated

But then the dreaded bell sounded, heralding Jacob's elimination. 

‘WHAT?!' a shell-shocked Williamson exclaimed, his mouth agape. 

Appearing visibly crest-fallen, Jacob made his way off the stage, leaving behind six finalists, among them the two teens who were later crowned co-champions for the first time in 52 years.

The video of Williamson's epic fail spread like wildfire online, only adding to his status as Internet’s newest star.

The bespectacled coin collector and fantasy football enthusiast has won over the hearts of viewers from coast to coast with his infectious enthusiasm.

Not a happy camper: At age 15, Williamson will not be eligible to compete in the spelling bee next year

Fan boy: Maple Leafs player Morgan Rielly tweeted his support for Williamson, calling him a 'hero'

Each time he got a word right, Williamson squealed with delight, pumped his fists in the air and jumped up and down on stage.

When he was informed by the Scripps judges Thursday afternoon that he was to be in the finals, the overjoyed 15-year-old fell to his knees.

‘My parents have always said I’m probably the least nervous person up here,’ a beaming Williamson said at the time.

The Twitter-sphere quickly embraced the world's most eager speller, using the Twilight-inspired hashtag TeamJacob to support the teen.

Toronto Maple Leafs player Morgan Rielly was an early fan, calling Williamson in a tweet 'THE MAN' and 'a hero.'

Like any viral sensation worth his salt, Jacob quickly became a meme, with rapper Lil Jon releasing on YouTube a remix of his memorable elimination.

Although Jacob appeared saddened  immediately after his loss, the 15-year-old was graceful in defat.

‘It was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed it,’ he told ESPN later. ‘I thought I knew that word but I guess I didn't.’

At the end of the day, Sriram Hathwar, of Painted Post, New York, and Ansun Sujoe, of Fort Worth, Texas, were crowned spelling bee co-champions after a riveting final-round duel in which they nearly exhausted the 25 designated championship words. After they spelled a dozen words correctly in a row, they both got the title.

Earlier, 14-year-old Sriram opened the door to an upset by 13-year-old Ansun after he misspelled 'corpsbruder,' a close comrade. But Ansun was unable to take the title because he got 'antegropelos,' which means waterproof leggings, wrong.

Sriram entered the final round as the favorite after finishing in third place last year. Ansun just missed the semifinals last year.

They become the fourth co-champions in the bee's 89-year history and the first since 1962.

'The competition was against the dictionary, not against each other,' Sriram said after both were showered with confetti onstage. 'I'm happy to share this trophy with him.'

Sriram backed up his status as the favorite by rarely looking flustered on stage, nodding confidently as he outlasted 10 other spellers to set up the one-on-one duel with Ansun. The younger boy was more nervous and demonstrative, no more so than on the word that gave him a share of the title: 'feuilleton,' the features section of a European newspaper or magazine.

'Ah, whatever!' Ansun said before beginning to spell the word as the stage lights turned red, signaling that he had 30 seconds left.

Although they hoisted a single trophy together onstage, each will get one to take home, and each gets the champion's haul of more than $33,000 in cash and prizes.

Gokul Venkatachalam of Chesterfield, Missouri, finished third, and Ashwin Veeramani of North Royalton, Ohio, was fourth.

Both champions are Indian-American. The past eight winners and 13 of the past 17 have been of Indian descent, a run that began in 1999 after Nupur Lala's victory, which was later featured in the documentary Spellbound.
