A family is in shock after a SWAT team threw a stun grenade into their 19-month-old son's crib during a midnight drugs raid, leaving the baby in a medically induced coma with severe burns.

Wisconsin mother Alecia Phonesavanh, her husband, Bounkham, and their children including toddler, Bou Jr., were visiting her sister-in-law in Atlanta, Georgia, when police raided the home early Wednesday.

Phonesavanh said officers threw a stun grenade, which landed in the sleeping child's crib.

Horror: Little Bou Phonesavanh, pictured right before and left after, was severely injured by a grenade during a police raid early Thursday

'It landed in his playpen and exploded on his pillow right in his face,' the distraught mother told WSBTV. 'It's my baby. He's only a baby. He didn't deserve any of this.'

The child was seriously injured and was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital's burn unit where doctors placed him in a medically induced coma.

'He's in the burn unit. We go up to see him and his whole face is ripped open. He has a big cut on his chest,' Phonesavanh said. 'He's only 19 months old. He didn't do anything.'

A picture shows the charred portable crib. Most photographs of the baby's injuries are too graphic to share though one shows burns all over his face.

Cornelia Police Chief Rick Darby confirmed the raid took place at the home just before 3 a.m.

He
 said a multijurisdictional drug unit issued a warrant and organized the
 SWAT operation. It's not clear if any drugs were found in the home 
during the raid.

Deputies said they bought drugs from the house and came back with a no-knock warrant to arrest a man known to have drugs and weapons, WSB reported. They arrested Wanis Thometheva, 30, during the raid.

Darby told WSBTV that the entire police unit is upset over the incident, which was an accident.

Bou Sr., a musician, wrote of his grief on his Facebook page Thursday morning.

'My friends my heart my mind my soul is fill with sadness right now my son is not doing too good l will need few days to get myself together l will get back and share music with you when we are all feels better keep rocking friends.'
