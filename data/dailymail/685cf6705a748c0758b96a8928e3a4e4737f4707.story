Kingpin: Charmaine Roman was arrested September 30 for her role in a violent Jamaican drug trafficking ring and now authorities say she was, in fact, the group's kingpin

A Florida woman was arrested in September on suspicions she aided a Jamaican drug trafficking ring and now  authorities say the Orange County grandmother was actually the group’s kingpin.

Charmaine Roman drove a Land Rover and lived in flashy condo, gambled avidly, and helped to raise her young grandson.

She was a typical wealthy Florida grandmother except for one difference: her lifestyle was paid for by a violent, multimillion dollar organized crime ring.

Roman, who authorities have been watching since 2006, did the books according to police.

The
Orlando Sentinel reports that the 42-year-old was in charge of the 
group’s finances and helped launder money at the Wynn Casino in Las 
Vegas to the tune of $3 million.

While
she deposited $3.3 million at the Wynn between 2010 and 2012, Roman 
paid far less in federal taxes according to case records.

Police say she used the cover of a concert promotion company called Sure Thing Investments.

Meanwhile,
a surprising amount of the grandmother’s income reportedly came not 
just racketeering but also from her gambling habits.

Since October 2009, Roman had redeemed 44 winning lottery tickets totaling $187,000.

One
of the wins may have also led to a violent home invasion in 2009, the 
Sentinel reports. After winning $15,000 on a scratch off ticket, robbers
broke into the Roman home and tied her and her daughters up, demanding 
they be given the money.

And just last August, Roman won an astonishing $100,000 on a ticket.

But the gambling was a hobby. The drug trade is allegedly what really paid the bills.

Varied interests: Roman's arrest came as part of a sting that seized over 3,000 pounds of marijuana. Her hobby appears to be scratch off lottery tickets. Between 2009 and 2012, the grandmother won $187,000

After years of surveillance and intelligence gathering, authorities finally pinched Roman September 30 as she pulled into an Orlando parking lot to during the delivery of a 400-pound shipment of marijuana.

She was arrested along with 50 as part of a sting police dubbed Operation Warehouse 13 that saw the seizure of 3,200 pounds of marijuana, $200,000 cash, 15 guns, and several cars.

Police dismantled the group and charged Roman and her cohorts with racketeering, trafficking in pot, and other charges.

Prosecutors allege the group has brought thousands of pounds of marijuana into Central Florida, and with it a tendency to do business violently.

Weapons: 15 guns, cars, and $200,000 in cash was found during Roman's drug ring bust September 30

In her possession were multiple cell phones, several passports in different names, four Florida ID cards, Social Security cards, credit cards and birth certificates.

Some showed Roman’s name as Antoinette Lewis and police saw she had multiple aliases.

Prosecutors allege Roman, who is Jamaican, is in the country illegally and has been for 20 years. They also remain unable to ascertain her genuine identity.

‘People generally don't have more than one identity,’ the judge said.

Roman was deemed too great a flight risk and denied bond.

Roman has no record of previous arrests in Florida.
