A terrifying video emerged last night showing Syrian rebels fleeing for their lives before a bomb explodes just metres away.

The close-up footage shows the terror civilians in Syria face on a day-to-day basis as the civil war rages into its 23rd month and the UN warns the death toll is approaching 70,000.

The video shows rebels wielding guns hiding behind a building as they wait for opportunity to run across to another street.

Close-up footage: A rebel waits by a building after a bomb has gone off in a street further up the road to the left

Help: Other rebels can be seen running across to where the bomb has gone to check on the wounded

A few men make it across as a rebel signals for the camera-holder to move forward with the group.

But as they make their way forward, a bomb explodes just metres away in the very spot they were heading for.

A shaky camera then moves towards the scene of the blast where men can be seen lying dead on the ground.

Run for it: The man standing by the camera runs forwards with other rebels

Double hit: As the camera moves up the road, another bomb goes off in the same spot as the last bomb

It is not know where or when the 44 second clip - which was uploaded on to video sharing website Live Leak - was filmed.

Another video revealed today shows 
powerful explosions taking place near a bakery as residents were buying 
bread, engulfing the street in dusty smoke and causing panic.

One man can be heard in the background saying: 'Allahu Akbar. Shelling of Hajeerah Albalad whist people buy bread. Allahu Akbar. Panic amongst children. Allahu Akbar. The electricity cables.'

And a third video shows a large explosion in Aleppo after a plane is heard flying overhead as President Bashar al-Assad's forces bombarded the southeast of Damascus with air strikes and artillery to try and dislodge rebel fighters who have gained a foothold in the Syrian capital, opposition activists said.

Chaos: Not very much can be seen as the camera starts moving towards where the latest bomb has exploded

Distressing: Bodies can be seen lying on the floor as the camera moves closer towards the bomb site

Jets bombed Jobar, a neighbourhood 
adjacent to the main Abbasid Square, and the suburb of Daraya on the 
highway to Jordan to the south, sources in the capital said.

The two areas are part of interconnected Sunni Muslim districts in and around Damascus that have been at the forefront of the uprising against four decades of family rule by President Bashar al-Assad and his father.

The army and a plethora of security forces remain entrenched in fortress-like bases in Damascus and the provincial capitals, where their advantages in air power and heavy weaponry have kept the opposition from taking over the major cities.

The Syrian uprising against Assad, is the bloodiest of the Arab revolts that toppled four autocrats in Libya, Egypt, Tunis and Yemen. The war has deepened the Middle East's Shi'ite-Sunni divide.

Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, yesterday said the death toll in Syria is likely approaching 70,000.

She told the UN Security Council that there have probably been almost 10,000 new deaths in recent weeks, adding that the council's deep division and inaction over the nearly two-year-old conflict had been 'disastrous' and that civilians on all sides had paid the price.
