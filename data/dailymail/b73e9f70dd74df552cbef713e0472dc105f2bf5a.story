The inquiry into historic child sex abuse is to be extended to crimes committed as long ago as the Second World War – and possibly even further.

It means child sex perverts dating back 70 years will be pursued, and raises the prospect of people in their 90s being hauled before the inquiry.

Those suspected of committing crimes will be handed over to police and could face jail.

Tough stance: Justice Lowell Goddard says the inquiry into historic child sex abuse is to be extended to crimes committed as long ago as the Second World War – and possibly even further

The extension in the investigation, sparked by claims of a 1980s Westminster paedophile ring, was revealed by Justice Lowell Goddard, the new head of the inquiry, in an interview with The Mail on Sunday.

New Zealander Goddard was recruited by Home Secretary Theresa May after two other women picked to lead it had to step down due to links with the Establishment.

Until now, it was thought the inquiry would focus on the post-1970 era. But Justice Goddard is backing demands to go further.

'It's elastic,' she says. 'The terms of reference talk about going back to 1970 but there is a push from certain quarters to take it back to about 1945. A cut-off point is always a bit artificial – someone who falls on the wrong side of it is aggrieved.'

The Mail on Sunday understands that Justice Goddard is backed by Mrs May, who is considering removing all time limits, meaning it could take in the entire 20th Century. Either way, it will be the world's biggest ever investigation into paedophiles – and will take years.

But Justice Goddard plans to issue a series of interim reports to avoid a repeat of the scandal over the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War, which has been held up for six years.

Axed: Baroness Butler-Sloss quit as chairman of the inquiry after questions were raised about her brother sitting in the Cabinet in the 1980s. Her replacement Fiona Woolf later resigned over her links to former home secretary Leon Brittan

In a wide-ranging interview, in which she also revealed details of a tragic marriage cut short by illness, Justice Goddard, 66, said she:

The alleged 1980s Westminster child sex ring is said to have involved senior figures. Former Tory Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who died last month, was accused of being involved and of covering it up, though this has never been substantiated.

Justice Goddard said she 'wouldn't shrink' from summoning prominent people to give evidence. 'I don't feel intimidated,' she said. 'Nobody should be beyond the reach of the law.'

She added it was 'far too early' to say if she would ask to speak to Lady Brittan, Lord Brittan's widow. 'The Westminster aspect is just one,' she said, confirming she will look at 'institutional allegations going back to post-Second World War'.

Justice Goddard also said she believed child sex abusers of 1945 should be treated the same as those in 2015.

'Sexual abuse of little children has never been anything short of a serious crime and that does not alter through religious or cultural mores or a different era or time,' she said. 'If criminal offending is evident it will be handed to police. There are people who need to be given a voice about what has happened to them.'
