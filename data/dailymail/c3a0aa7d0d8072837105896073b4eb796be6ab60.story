A man has had both his legs cut off after drunkenly falling in front of a New York Subway train last night.Â 

The unidentified man, said to be in his 40s, was waiting for a train in the Bronx, when he fell off the platform into the path of an incoming train, the Gothamist reports.

Before he could pull himself to safety, the D-train came into the 161 Street-Yankee Stadium subway stop crushing and severing both of his legs.
