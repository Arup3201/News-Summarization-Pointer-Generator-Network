Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is keen to continue his relationship with the club after insisting he is not waiting for any offers from elsewhere.

Guardiola took charge of the German powerhouses in June 2013 and has led them to success in the Bundesliga and in domestic and European cup competition.

His time has been dogged by speculation over swapping leagues, most notably to England and to names like Manchester City, with his current Bayern deal set to run out in 2016.

However, ahead of his side's DFB-Pokal game against Eintracht Braunschweig, the former Barcelona boss told a press conference: 'Of course I'll stay here. I haven't had a contract offer and I am not waiting for a contract offer from anyone else.

'I'm happy here at Bayern, my only idea right now is to stay and work for this club here.

'I can stay in this club five or six years even. This also depends on the players. I'm not the most important thing for the club.'Â
