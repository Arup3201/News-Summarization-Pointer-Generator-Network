This adorable puppy born without front legs has become an internet sensation after learning to deal with its disability.

The eight-month-old Daschund-Chihuahua cross - known as a Chiweenie - was named T-Rex by owners because of his likeness to the carnivorous dinosaur.

Vets have been 'astonished' by the strength T-Rex has developed - and his 6,000 Instagram followers have also clearly been impressed.

T-Rex was born into a litter of six males puppies - three of which were born with disabilities.

While T-Rex survived along with another Chiweenie that was born without front legs, their sibling - born without back legs - sadly passed away.

After being born in April, T-Rex got a new owner in July and is thriving in his new home.

Owner Felix Wiegmann, an electrician from San Antonio, Texas, got the dog from his cousin - who named the puppy as soon as he was born.

‘The vets are astonished by how strong he is,' he said.

‘T-Rex was offered to several family friends of my cousins, but always ended up being declined because of his disabilities.

‘But while taking care of T-Rex, my cousin and her family ended up getting attached to him and decided that T-Rex was going to stay and be a part of their family.’

He explained that T-Rex is a dog that needs ‘a lot of attention’ and his cousin eventually decided to keep him away in the family.

‘My cousin and her family did consider having him put down at first and were really frightened. They thought he wasn't going to be able to get around.

‘However after doing some research they found that he could grow up to be just fine.’

The Instagram account for T-Rex was already up and running when Mr Wiegmann got him, but the account now boasts over 6,000 followers.

T-Rex has adapted to life without front legs and can run at speed on carpet.

Mr Wiegmann said: 'He knows he is different but that does not stop him from running around and being just as hyper as any other Chiweenie.

'T-Rex just knows that if he goes on the kitchen tiles or concrete he will take a little longer. He gets on his two back legs to walk or hop.

'I think the other animals are more aware of his disability than he is. We have five cats and another dog, a Bichon Frise called Matilda, who don't all like each other, but they have all taken well to T-Rex.'

Over time T-Rex is expected to use a wheelchair during the day to reduce the amount of stress on his back.

But his owner has decided to keep its usage to a minimum as T-Rex enjoys walking and hopping around.
