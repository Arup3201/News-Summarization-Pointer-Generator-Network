He is famously so enamoured with bicycles that he installed thousands across London so that everybody could have a go.

But in private Boris Johnson seems to occasionally prefer something with a bit more luxury than a rusty two-wheeler.

The London Mayor has been reportedly spotted in a chauffeur-driven BMW - complete with a number plate reading ‘MAY10R’.

Check the label Boris Johnson was pictured travelling in a BMW with a personalised number plate which read: MAY 10R

His trademark blond mop of hair was seen in the back of the prestige car as it travelled along the M4 from Heathrow towards Central London.

It is believed that the colourful Tory politician had just been on holiday to Greece with his long-suffering wife Marina.

He headed straight to Westminster while his wife, in a matching chauffeur-driven BMW, headed for the couple’s North London home.

The personalised plate highlighting his role at the top of the Capital’s City Hall is believed to be worth around £20,000.

But mystery surrounds why he came to be using it because it is not a Transport for London vehicle and Boris owns a bashed up 14-year-old Toyota people carrier.

His use of the number plate is even more perplexing because of his potential return to the ranks of Tory MPs in Westminster.

Taking up a seat is the first step Boris must take before challenging for the leadership of his party after the 2015 General Election.

Within days of his luxury ride it was back to business as usual as Boris was seen on his trusty bicycle during the Tube strike.

They see me rollin': The bespoke number plate is expected to be worth £20,000

Last Friday, the Mayor - who has yet to confirm whether he will run for a third term in 2016 - was back on the Tube at Putney.

Boris is not the only Mayor to have access to a personalised plate.

The Lord Mayor of London - an entirely different office - has use of a 1980s Rolls Royce Phantom with the plate LM 0.

According to the DVLA, the ‘MAY10R’ plate was first sold at auction about 20 years ago for just paltry £2,000.

But a spokesman added: ‘The value will have increased quite a lot by now. It all depends on demand.

‘I can imagine this one is quite special. There are some similar plates out there - M4YOR for example - which are on the market for up to £25,000.’

A spokesman for the Mayor confirmed he was in the vehicle, adding that he had ‘organised the car privately’.
