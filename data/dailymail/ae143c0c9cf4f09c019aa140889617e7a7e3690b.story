Less than two years ago Wasps’ players reached the end of each month not knowing if they would even get paid.

Losing money at a rate of close to £4million a season and unable to identify a suitable site around the M25 to build a new stadium, one of the most successful clubs in the history of English rugby was sinking.

In massive debt to the taxman and with no means of generating profit as tenants of Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park, Wasps’ decline appeared terminal.

On Tuesday, following major investment from Irish businessman Derek Richardson and a new sponsorship deal with Land Rover, Wasps conducted a first training session at their new, 32,000 capacity Ricoh Arena home in Coventry.

There is talk of significant further investment, ‘world-class’ training facilities, record crowds and a major recruitment drive.

Despite early resistance from a significant number of fans when the plan to relocate to the Midlands was first announced in October, it is hard to escape a sense that the good times are once again just around the corner for the two-time European champions.

‘It’s just a massive sigh of relief,’ said fit-again winger Christian Wade, who is expected to feature in the club’s first Aviva Premiership clash at the Ricoh on Sunday against London Irish, when a record home crowd of more than 27,000 is expected.

‘You feel like you can relax now and just focus on the rugby rather than worry about all the other stuff. Pretty much all the time we were always worrying about what was going to happen. Are we moving or are we going to have a club next year? Do I need to speak to my agent? Do I need to move clubs?

‘This facility is amazing. It’s probably the dream for any player in the world to have your own stadium and your own training ground in the same area.’

Sportsmail understands Wasps have already secured the services of Leinster fly-half Jimmy Gopperth, and chief executive Nick Eastwood confirmed that the club will be in a position to spend up to the £5.5million salary cap next season for the first time.

In October the club announced a contract extension with England lock Joe Launchbury — who will see a specialist tomorrow to discover if he needs surgery on a persistent neck injury which is threatening his Six Nations.

Director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘Everyone realises now that we are in the market for top quality international players, whereas probably 18 months ago we weren’t.

‘Teams are built, you can’t just buy teams, but it certainly helps if you can buy a little bit of stardust to sprinkle on solid foundations.’

Revenue from ticket sales for Sunday’s opener against the Exiles has already passed £500,000 and with the possibility of a winner-takes-all final European Cup pool game in January, the business logic behind the move is evident.

‘This will be the most successful game we have ever staged,’ said Eastwood, who is predicting a massive increase in the club’s annual turnover from £7m to more than £20m. ‘The revenue will be three times the highest grossing game we had at Adams Park.

‘In 18 months we have gone from being bust, tenants in a fourth division football ground to owning probably the best arena in club rugby in Europe and financial security. It is pretty remarkable.’

n London Irish are today expected to announce that director of rugby Brian Smith will leave at the end of the season. Former Ireland coach Declan Kidney is favourite to replace him.
