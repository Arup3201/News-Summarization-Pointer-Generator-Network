It has been revealed that the Department of Motor vehicles in Arizona has been putting the wrong pictures and names of people on some driving licenses that have recently been produced.

Transportation officials are blaming a new computer system which they say caused the errors leading to some individuals getting the wrong picture on their drivers' permit.

Jennifer Lohss renewed her identification card and driver's permit at Motor Vehicles Department.

On the temporary copy, everything was correct, but when the permanent cards arrived in the mail she noticed immediately that the picture was entirely wrong.

'All of my information was correct. There was just somebody else's picture and somebody else's signature,' said Miss Lohss.

With all of her personal information out there, her number one concern was that it could end up getting into the wrong hands.

Director Stacey Stanton told CBS5 that so far there have only been five instances of mistaken identity.

Worries: What concerns Jennifer is that someone else may also have all of her personal information

It's possible the mistakes occurred after the agency just transitioned to a new centralized system last week.

'We immediately had a team assembled to assess what the issues might be. We don't believe that this is a systemic issue. We believe it's more individualized, and we need to find those nuances,' Stanton said.

She believes that the fault was caused after the agency transitioned to a new centralized system.

A team of employees is examining what could be causing the glitch.
