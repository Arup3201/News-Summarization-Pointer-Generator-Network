Sick patients should email their GP instead of going to see them, a leading health official said yesterday.

NHS Confederation boss Mike Farrar stunned MPs by saying that contacting GPs online instead of in person would reduce the pressures on hospital casualty units.

His astonishing suggestion came after MPs demanded to know how NHS bosses planned to solve the ‘state of crisis’ in A&E departments, which are struggling to cope with a huge surge in patient numbers.

MPs were told that part of the intolerable pressure A&E units were under was in part because GPs' surgeries were shut by 5pm and on 
weekends.

Patients will minor ailments unable to reach their GP during out-of-hour periods were filling up emergency departments 
unnecessarily, the Royal College of Physicians said.

And Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will accuse GPs of abdicating their responsibility for out-of-hours services in a major speech.

Chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the Government’s 111 non-emergency number have pushed many hospitals to breaking point.

Yesterday it emerged that senior doctors at 20 A&E units have written to the Government to say the care they are providing is ‘frequently unsafe’ as a result of ‘toxic overcrowding’.

Mr Farrar admitted many units were ‘on a cliff edge’. He told the Commons health select committee that the answer was to discourage patients from going to see their GP in the first place.

He said giving patients ‘immediate access’ to their doctor by email or telephone had been shown in pilot schemes to cut A&E attendances by 20 per cent.

Patients would email their GP with a brief description of their symptoms or with any queries regarding medication. The doctor would then assess the urgency of their case and if necessary, encourage them to come to the surgery or visit them at home.

The Department of Health has been carrying out a pilot of this system for two years, with 90 practices thought to be taking part.

Dr Patrick Cadigan, of the Royal College of Physicians, said A&E units were suffering because they were open when GPs surgeries are shut.

‘We need to face up to the fact that the services other than A&E departments are run on a nine-to-five elective basis,’ he said.

‘Patients will go where the lights are on. In many of these alternatives the lights are not on after five o’clock in the evening or until weekends.

But MPs said they were ‘seriously concerned’ about Mr Farrar’s proposals.

Labour’s Valerie Vaz said: ‘The average patient wouldn’t know what to say or what to ask. This idea that you just ring up a doctor and tell them about your symptoms – I thought medicine was based on observation.’

The number of patients admitted to A&E has increased by a quarter of a million in the past year, with reports of elderly patients waiting 24 hours on trolleys.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has blamed the problem on GPs giving up responsibility for patients out of hours and allowing care to be provided by unreliable private firms.

In a major speech tomorrow, he plans to say that Labour’s ‘historic mistake’ in agreeing to the contracts had led to the scandal of out-of-hours services where patients are told to ‘speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam’.

But critics say the disastrous launch of the non-emergency 111 service earlier this year has increased the pressures on A&E.

Its poorly trained staff sent hundreds of patients to hospitals unnecessarily – with some given ambulances for flu symptoms.

Others felt they had no choice but to go to hospital after their calls to the 111 service were unanswered.

In a letter leaked to The Independent, 20 senior A&E doctors have warned that the crisis is so severe that doctors can no longer guarantee safe care for patients.

A combination of ‘toxic overcrowding’ and ‘institutional exhaustion’ is putting lives at risk, according to the letter, written to senior NHS managers from the leaders of 18 emergency departments in the West Midlands.

They warn that the rising number of patients presenting themselves for treatment has created a ‘state of crisis’ in casualty departments.

The letter read: ‘What is entirely unacceptable is the delivery of unsafe care, but that is now the prospect we find ourselves facing on too frequent a basis.

‘Nurses and doctors are forced to deliver care in corridors and inappropriate areas within the emergency department, routinely sacrificing patient privacy and dignity and frequently operating at the absolute margins of clinical safety.’

Dr Mike Clancy, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said the crisis was so serious, it will take ‘20 years’ to solve.

When asked about the problems by MPs, Mr Farrar, whose organisation represents NHS managers, quoted research from Patient Access, which represents 40 GP practices in England.

He said two or three practices in Leicester and the East Midlands – where patients spoke to GPs over the phone rather than seeing them – had the lowest A&E admissions.

Under the system, patients phone the surgery in office hours hoping to make an appointment but are instead told by a receptionist that a doctor will call them back.

Usually they receive a phone-call from a doctor within 30 minutes to discuss their symptoms and if  necessary are told to come into the surgery.

Mr Farrar said: ‘They’ve reduced the number of patients who get face-to-face consultations and don’t seem to get any detrimental outcomes.

‘The evidence seems to be that patients like it and there is no deterioration in their care.’

Mr Farrar added: 'The schemes that I highlighted to the Health Select Committee have broadly had a positive impact for the patients that have used them.

'We do need to look at how we reduce the numbers of people visiting A&E, and part of this means helping people access the right services.

'Where cases are not an emergency and patients do not need to visit hospital, the NHS should be helping people stay in their own homes and access quality care and expert advice.

'Schemes like this are all about giving patients choice about allowing them to decide how they receive their care, using technology to help enhance the services that we provide.

'This is by no means the only solution to the problems we face. But we need do need to look at a range of options and take urgent action to avoid pressures crippling the system.'
