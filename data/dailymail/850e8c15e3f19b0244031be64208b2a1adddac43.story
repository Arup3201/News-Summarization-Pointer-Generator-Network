New manager, same old problems. Steve Clarke’s first game as Reading manager ended in defeat as 10-man Watford escaped with a 1-0 win at the Madejski Stadium.

Watford’s Gabrielle Angella was sent off for a second bookable offence in first half stoppage time, giving Clarke an ideal opportunity to start delivering on his promise of a Barclays Premier League promotion push this season.

But this was a welcome to the Championship the new man at the helm will want to forget in a hurry, as Almen Abdi’s second-half strike proved the winner for visitors Watford.

It had looked like Clarke would have referee Gavin Ward to thank come Saturday evening.

The official booked Watford defender Angella half hour in for holding back striker Glenn Murray, before showing the Italian a second yellow before half time for deliberate handball.

And, in truth, Reading should have taken advantage. Chances fell the way of Nick Blackman and Murray, among others, but all squandered whatever sniff they were given of the Watford goal.

It took just 40 seconds for Reading to mount their first attack, though Murray’s side-footed volley served only as a warning when it went high over the crossbar.

Seven minutes later Watford’s Angella gave away an inviting free-kick 22 yards out after a blatant nudge in Murray’s back. Oliver Norwood stepped up, but only found the stands.

Still, it was a promising start from a side that had lost 6-1 against Birmingham City last week before the sacking of manager Nigel Adkins on Monday.

Clarke cut an animated figure on the touchline, jotting notes in his pad throughout as Reading looked to establish a foothold in a scrappy affair.

Neither side could truly take command in the first 45 minutes. Possession was wasted and chances came in dribs and drabs, particularly from distance or on the counter-attack.

It was the latter that led referee Ward to produce Angella’s first yellow card when he dragged Murray back to prevent Reading a breakaway.

‘This is a library,’ sang the traveling Watford support of 2,749. They weren’t entirely wrong. The Madejski atmosphere which Clarke raved about in his pre-match programme notes was found wanting. That is, until the opening minute of first half stoppage time.

Garath McCleary ran at 25-year-old Angella who, falling to ground, handled the ball on the edge of the box as the Reading winger looked to get past. The referee deemed it intentional and produced a second yellow to leave Watford a man shy for more than 45 minutes.

After the break, the best chance of the match fell to Murray. The striker had only Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to beat from inside the box to the left, but his shot agonisingly went beyond the far post.

It was all Reading. Watford scrambled to get out of their own half. But again, lines were fluffed.

McCleary beat Watford’s Daniel Pudil before finding Blackman alone at the back post, only for the Reading forward to lose his footing and slice what seemed a sure-thing.

They were made to pay. A cut back from the left by Ikechi Anya found the approaching Abdi who, with a low drive and in space, found the net beyond goalkeeper Federici.

It was against the play, but Watford were ruthless in taking their chance with 10 men.

Cue a Reading onslaught. They threw men forward, but never made Gomes break a sweat. The trouble is, Clarke may have arrived at the Madejski, but he is stuck with a squad shy of confidence.

Boos rang around upon the final whistle as Watford left 1-0 winners, and Clarke's promotion promise fell on deaf ears.
