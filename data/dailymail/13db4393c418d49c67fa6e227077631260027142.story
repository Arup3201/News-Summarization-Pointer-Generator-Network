Judge Judy's district attorney son is under pressure to step down after he was accused of leaking grand jury information to help his personal trainer get off a child sex charge.

Adam Levy, who serves as District Attorney Putnam County, New York, could face four years behind bars if he is charged and convicted of the leak.

It relates to his former live-in trainer Alexandru Hossu who has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and bragging about his connections to the family.

New York State Senator Greg Ball said
'questions have arisen as to whether Levy specifically communicated to 
[Hossu] how the grand jury actually voted,' in addition to providing the
man with money, legal advice, key info and strategies.

Senator Ball
told The ENQUIRER: 'Enough is enough! I am asking Adam Levy to either 
step down or join me in my request that Governor Cuomo appoint an 
independent special prosecutor to fully investigate the current fiasco 
in Putnam County.

'We 
have an elected district attorney who admits to having an illegal alien 
living in his house, who is also an alleged rapist, and is now funding 
the defense after telling the public he wasn’t involved.'

It has since emerged that Hossu, who is originally from Romania, is allegedly an illegal immigrant after outstaying his visa - despite working for one of New York's top lawyers.

Levy, the son of television personality 'Judge' Judy Scheindlin, has come under fire for employing Hossu, 35, and giving him accommodation at his million-dollar house in Putnam, New York.

He has vehemently denied knowing about Hossu's immigration status and has become embroiled in a public scrap over the accusations with the sheriff of the county.

Hossu was charged last week with two counts of first-degree rape after the 15-year-old daughter of a friend told a school counselor she had been sexually abused by him when she was 12.

He is accused of 'forcibly and violently' raping the 12-year-old girl twice in October 2010. It did not occur at Levy's home.

While
the relative asked the girl about the rape after she revealed the 
alleged attacks to her counselor, she simply said: 'I was told not to 
say anything about it.'

'I don't care if this takes down the 
D.A.,' the relative told the News Journal. 'It's heartbreaking that (the
girl) carried this all by herself and didn’t tell us.'

The
revelations have also sparked a feud between Levy and Putnam County 
Sheriff Donald B. Smith, who has accused the D.A. of using his position 
to mislead the public.

'In my view, Mr. Levy’s comments and actions would seem to suggest that, if he could have his own way, Mr. Hossu would never have been brought to justice for his crime and Mr Levy’s relationship with him would have never been brought to the light of public scrutiny,' Smith said in a statement.

Levy in turn has lambasted the sheriff for claiming Hossu lived at his home. The sheriff has countered that the address on Hossu's driving license is the same as Levy's home.

Levy offered two further addresses as
Hossu’s residence, which are both in Clocktower Commons, which is used for office space. One address was also used for a senator's political campaign.

Levy has argued that he had 'absolutely no idea whatsoever' of Hossu's immigration status, and that an investigation with show that Hossu had a valid driver's license and Social Security number.

Home: Hossu reportedly lived at Levy's million-dollar home, pictured, in Brewster. But Levy has denied knowing he was an illegal immigrant even though others said it was well known

He has asked a neighbouring county to handle the rape case because he knows the suspect.

Hossu is being held in Putnam County jail in Carmel on $50,000 cash or $100,000 bond, and he is due in court on April 2.

The charges will no doubt come as an embarrassment for Levy's family, including his television personality mother, Judge Judy Sheindlin.

Sheindlin, 70, makes $123,000 per day for a $45 million annual salary, SFGate reported. Forbes listed her net worth at $110 million in 2012.
