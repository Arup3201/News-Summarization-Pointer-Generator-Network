A group of five state grammar schools are planning a huge increase in pupil numbers despite a Government ban on new grammar schools, it has emerged.

The King Edward VI Foundation, a group of five prestigious schools in Birmingham, plans to admit 130 more students at its five schools from next September.

The foundation wants to recruit more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to counter claims that grammar schools mostly benefit the well-off.

In addition, it will increase funding for two independent schools it controls by Â£3million in order to expand the range of subsidies and scholarships on offer for poorer students, the  Independent said.

The five Birmingham schools which come under the King Edward VI umbrella are Aston, Camp Hill school for Boys, Camp Hill School for Girls, Five Ways and Handsworth.

News that more grammar school places are being made available will please advocates of selective education, who are frustrated that no new grammars have opened for decades thanks to a Government ban.

Only 164 state-run grammar schools remain in England concentrated in certain areas such as Kent, Essex and Lincolnshire. A few areas retain a formal grammar school system, using the 11 Plus exam to select the most able pupils. These include Trafford and Buckinghamshire.

Supporters argue that selective state education promotes social mobility by providing chances for talented children whose parents cannot afford private school fees.

However, opponents such as teaching unions claim that grammar schools mostly benefit the well-off who are able to coach their children for the 11-plus exam.

A report released last week by the Sutton Trust, a leading educational charity, found that children who went to private prep schools were four times more likely to pass the 11-plus than pupils who qualify for free school meals.

The King Edward VI Foundation insists it will concentrate on recruiting from poorer areas to prevent the schools from becoming the preserve of the rich.

John Collins, secretary to the foundation's governors, told the newspaper: 'We are increasing admission to our five free grammar schools for 2014 under the existing selection criteria but we aim to implement changes that will make all of our schools more accessible from 2015.

'The foundation wants to ensure that all parents and schools with naturally gifted and talented children are aware of the opportunities.'

Although the moratorium on selective schools has prevented the establishment of any more grammar schools, the number of grammar school pupils rose by 32,000 between 1997 and 2007 as each school took on more students.

In Kent, local councillors have approved the construction of a new 'satellite' grammar school sponsored by an existing institution.

The debate over grammar schools was stoked over the weekend when Sir John Major attacked the dominance of privately educated people at the top of the society, prompting new calls for the reinstatement of selective state schools.
