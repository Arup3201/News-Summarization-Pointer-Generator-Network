One of America's top health officials says there would probably already be a vaccine for Ebola if it were not for budget cuts to scientific research, but his own agency has seen a 69 per cent annual budget increase since 2000.

Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said a lack of money invested in research over the past decade has hampered the production of vaccinations for infectious diseases. And a new television ad claims that budget 'cuts' enacted by Republicans are responsible.

But Collins himself presides over the decision-making on how much NIH funding is devoted to medical research, an insider told MailOnline. And overall funding for the agency is up to $30.15 billion this year – up from $17.84 billion in 2000.

And the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the sub-agency in charge of research to combat potential epidemics, has seen a whopping 220 per cent increase in the same period of time.

The Agenda Project, a group that works to elect liberal politicians, is blaming Republican lawmakers for what it says is a drop in funding for disease research

BUDGET CUTS? Overall federal funding for the NIH (in red) is up 69 per cent since 2000; the NIAID, which is in charge of epidemic disease research, is up 220 per cent

Collins claimed over the weekend that budget cuts in Washington have left the international community playing catch-up on a potentially avoidable humanitarian catastrophe.

'NIH has been working on Ebola vaccines since 2001,' Dr. Collins told The Huffington Post. 'It's not like we suddenly woke up and thought, "Oh my gosh, we should have something ready here".'

'Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would've gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.'

That ten-year slide, an agency insider told MailOnline, is not Congress' fault.

'Say what you will about Congress,' the 15-year NIH veteran said on Monday, but every government agency is always looking for more money and in the case of NIH, we usually get it.'

'I've been around the block a few times, and I'm surprised at how cynical this stuff has become now that we're using Ebola as an excuse to ramp up the budget next year. It's awful.'

A liberal advocacy group called The Agenda Project began running a 30-second television ad on Monday claiming that the GOP is responsible for cuts in NIH funding that led to a slow Ebola response.

'Republican Cuts Kill,' the ad blares, following a montage of Republicans saying the word 'cut.' It's unclear whether any of them were speaking about medical research funding when they made their comments.

During the first two years of his presidency, President Barack Obama had the benefit of a Congress with Democrats in control of both houses.

In the federal budget passed during the first of those two years, NIH funding increased 2.3 per cent. In the second, it was decreased by 1 per cent.

The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) figures published last week.

Clinical trials on potential Ebola vaccines have been rushed into operation, including one drug trial for healthcare workers in Mali. It could take months before its effectiveness is known.

In the United States, it takes an average of 12 years for a pharmaceutical company to clear all the regulatory hurdles associated with securing a new drug approval. 

WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection'

Speaking from NIH's headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, Dr. Collins said some therapeutics to fight Ebola 'were on a slower track than would've been ideal, or that would have happened if we had been on a stable research support trajectory'.

'We would have been a year or two ahead of where we are, which would have made all the difference,' he said.

Dr. Collins' words came as the WHO called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'.

The organization also said  that economic disruptions can be curbed if people are adequately informed to prevent irrational moves to dodge infection.

WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, citing World Bank figures, said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection'.

Staffers of the global health organization 'are very well aware that fear of infection has spread around the world much faster than the virus,' Chan said in a statement read out to a regional health conference in the Philippine capital, Manila.

'We are seeing, right now, how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world,' she said.

But Ms Chan added that adequately educating the public was a 'good defense strategy' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions.

She did not specify those steps but praised the Philippines for holding an anti-Ebola summit last week which was joined by government health officials and private sector representatives, warning that the Southeast Asian country was vulnerable due to the large number of Filipinos working abroad.

Last week, Thomas Eric Duncan from Dallas became the first Ebola patient to die from the virus in the US

While bracing for Ebola, health officials should continue to focus on major health threats, including non-communicable diseases, she said.

Last month, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged leaders in the most affected countries to establish special centers that aim to isolate infected people from non-infected relatives in an effort to stem the spread of Ebola.

Ban has also appealed for international airlines and shipping companies not to suspend services to countries affected by Ebola. Doing so, he said, hinders delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance.

Healthcare systems in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where the outbreak was first recorded in March, have been overwhelmed by the epidemic. The disease has also spread to Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States.

Last week, Thomas Duncan from Dallas, Texas, became the first Ebola patient to die from the virus in the United States.

Dr. Collins, who spends his days almost exclusively on the disease, urged for calm when contemplating the possibility of an outbreak of the Ebola virus. 

He said Ebola is a highly deadly disease, but it is also only transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids or objects contaminated with the virus.

'Certainly there's been a lot of fear [in the] response from people who are probably at essentially zero risk, that this might somehow take over our country, which is really not going to happen,' he told the Huffington Post.

Dr. Collins said he the development of vaccines to fight Ebola 'were on a slower track than would've been ideal'

'And despite all the assurances [...] it still hasn't quite sunk in. There's still the cable news people who are whipping this up, and frankly sometimes using it for political purposes to sort of shoot at the government.'

Dr. Collins said he agreed with the comparison made by Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of the current Ebola crisis to the outbreak of AIDS. 

But the current crisis should be kept in perspective.

'More people will die today of AIDS than have died so far in the entire Ebola epidemic,' he said.

'We've somehow gotten used to that, and it doesn't seem to be so threatening or frightening. Certainly in the United States, another 50,000 people will get infected with HIV this year, because that's been sort of the steady number.

'How many more people will get infected with Ebola this year in the US?' he said. 'I would guess you could count among the fingers of two hands, depending on what contacts of the guy in Dallas actually turned out to get infected.'
