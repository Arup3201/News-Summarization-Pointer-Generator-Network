Blake Lively has appeared in a quick-fire video interview with Vogue; in which viewers are treated to a five-minute rundown on seemingly everything there is to know about the blonde star.

The refreshingly down-to-earth - albeit impeccably styled – 26-year-old actress answers a total of 73 questions, from which viewers discover that she loves to eat dessert, especially chocolate soufflé; identifies more as a man; and has herself an enviably adoring husband in actor Ryan Reynolds, 37.

When asked to reveal one of the best things that had ever happened to her, the 26-year-old star replied: 'A video of all the people that have made an impact on my life, from my husband.'

Lucky girl: Blake Lively has appeared in a Vogue video interview, in which she reveals that her adoring husband, Ryan Reynolds, once made her a video compilation of people who have had an impact on her life

In turn, the Gossip Girl star mentioned that she had planned a similar stunt, which involved an assortment of short stories from loved ones, as a surprise for Mr Reynolds, who she married in 2012.

As part of the interview, an exceptionally lively Ms Lively was handed a tray of freshly baked cupcakes to decorate; a task she was clearly delighted to get into.

Speaking of her tendency to spend 'too much' time in the kitchen of the Westchester, New York, home she shares with Mr Reynolds, she said, 'My husband has coined it "The Blakery,"' adding that at times she is up until 4am baking cookies.

And when she's not whipping up calorific treats, she's chowing down on them too. Ms Lively listed 'cake,' 'chocolate souffle,' 'melted cheese,' mayonnaise,' and 'truffle pappardelle' as her favorite foods, and 'sea urchin,' as her least favorite.

When asked if she usually baked cupcakes, Ms Lively deftly quipped: 'Yes. They are much better baked than raw.'

Other bite-sized chunks of trivia reveal the star's affinity for pianos, Paris, puppies and the color pink - her prom dress was coral, she says - as well as a preference for hot chocolate over coffee and a disregard for Starbucks.

Amusingly, she also admitted that she identifies more with the men in HBO's Sex and the City than any of the four main female characters.

The snappy video follows a more in-depth interrogation from Vogue into the personal life of Ms Lively, as she covered the magazine's August issue.

Speaking gushingly of Mr Reynolds - and hinting at the pitter-patter of tiny feet - she said: 'He’s going to be a great father and leader and patriarch - he’s so meant to be all of those things.'

She also discussed the launch of her much-anticipated new lifestyle website, Preserve, which covers, in her own words: 'People, stories, essays, videos and goods which hopefully inspire your home, your style and your tongue.'

The domestic goddess revealed that she has been working on the project for the past two years, and now, with the help of a team of 12, she is finally ready to share the fruits of her labors with the world.

She has already been likened to Martha Stewart in that much of her site's coverage is dedicated to food and crafts. But there is no competition between the two women. In fact Ms Stewart is a neighbor and friend, who fully supports Ms Lively's new endeavor.

And as for comparisons to that other actress-turned-tastemaker, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ms Lively insists: '[I'm] not trying to show you the perfect life or the aspirational life. It’s real life. It’s the thing that blindsides you on an idle Tuesday that’s tragic but that also makes you who you are.

'It’s not about me. And it’s not about watching my journey of learning how-to, it’s about me sharing that with you so we all sort of learn together.'

Ms Lively has not quit acting altogether though. She plays the lead in The Age of Adaline, that tells the early 20th century tale of a 29-year-old woman who stops aging after an accident - due for release next year.
