No it's not Australia's new high-speed crime fighting car - but if it was, it would have speeding crooks quaking in their boots.

It's a $200,000 promotional sports car, a Porsche 911 Carrera actually, which has been unleashed on schools across Sydney,NSW as a part of a campaign to grab students' attention and get them engaging with the state's police force.

The mean-looking motor vehicle joined a northern Sydney fleet of squad cars this year, after the success of an earlier Porsche model - the Panamera - which was first issued to police for the same promotional reasons in 2012.

The Porsche 911 Carrera which can reach top speeds of 259km/hr 

And although it's top speed of 259km/hr would make it perfect for high-speed pursuits - there is no  intention of it ever being used to fight crime. 

It is suitably equipped, however, as a weapon for high-speed chases with sirens and flashing lights attached.

At top speed, the blue-and-white cheque sports car  is able to reach 259km/hr but that speed is rarely, if ever, required.

What does work best on students though is its sleek design and unique markings - the brain child of a university student who won a competition to have them plastered on the side of the vehicle. 

The earlier model Panamera was provided to the NSW Police by Cars Australia back in 2012 - but the new model has since been rolled-out with a  face-lift

It is worth $200,000 and comes fully equipped with all the tools you would find in an ordinary patrol car

For the past two years, Porsche Cars Australia have sponsored a Porsche Panamera for officers from Harbourside Local Area Command to attend schools, community events, charity fund-raisers and local youth programs, and generate positive interactions between police and the community.

The success of the program has seen Porsche Cars Australia extend their support to sponsoring this white 2014 Porsche 911 Carrera, which will continue to visit events across the state. 

Porsche Cars Australia managing director, Michael Winkler said its roll-out was the first  of its kind when it was  issued to the NSW police force in 2012.

'This is the first time we've made available a Porsche to any police force in Australia and the curiosity factor alone of a Panamera in police decals should help the NSW Police achieve awareness and engage people in its community programs'. 

The new vehicle, with blue and white cheques, is an upgraded version of an earlier model rolled-out in 2012

The car belongs to the Harbourside Police force, which operates in Sydney's north shore

The vehicle's design was put to the public as part of a competition with a student from University of Western Sydney winning
