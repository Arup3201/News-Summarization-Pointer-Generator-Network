A British man, his partner, and three-year-old daughter are among those missing in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, reports claim.

Colin Bembridge, 61, was staying with his Filipino partner Maybelle, 35, and their child Victoria near Tacloban when the category five storm struck, killing thousands.

The pharmacist, who lives in Grimbsy, had been visiting his girlfriend's relatives and had hired a beach house in Baybay, one of the ravaged coastal villages, according to Channel 4 News.

Missing: Colin Bembridge, 61, with his Filipino partner Maybelle, 35, and their three-year-old daughter Victoria who are among the missing in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan

Relatives have appealed for help finding Victoria and her parents, who went missing the day the storm struck

Typhoon Haiyan has left up to 10,000 dead and many more homeless, and large numbers of survivors are struggling without food, water and shelter.

The mother of Mr Bembridge's partner, 79-year-old Lydia revealed pictures of the wrecked beach house where her daughter and granddaughter had been staying on Channel 4 News.

'I just want to know whether they are dead or whether they were blown by the winds,' she told the programme.

While searching the wreckage she found a dress belonging to Maybelle - the youngest of her eight children - and a games console belonging to Victoria.

She added: 'Now that I am here I cannot see them. I am at a loss of where they are. My heart, it's hurting.'

Family: Mr Bembridge, from Grimsby, had been visiting his partner's relatives when Typhoon Haiyan hit last week

Winds of up to 235mph and gusts of 170mph
left a trail of destruction last week - triggering major landslides, knocking out
power and communications and causing catastrophic widespread damage.

Hundreds of homes have been flattened and scores of streets flooded.

Workers in Tacloban have been burying scores of unidentified bodies in a mass grave as desperately-needed aid begins to arrive.

According to the country's national disaster agency, four million people were affected.

About 15,000 British nationals are said to live on the islands and every year 65,000 visit tourist hotspots like northern Cebu Province and Boracay Island, both of which have been savaged by the storm.

A multimillion pound aid project has now been launched to care for the homeless and wounded and to find missing people.

Plea: Lydia, the mother of Maybelle (pictured with Victoria) said: 'I just want to know whether they are dead'

More than Â£30million has been raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) in just three days.

The alliance of 14 UK aid charities said the funds raised will be used to deliver vital food, water and sanitation equipment, household items and building materials to rebuild essential infrastructure in the ruined areas.

Its chief executive Saleh Saeed said: 'The DEC member agencies and their partners are working on the ground to deliver essential aid.

'But the needs are so great, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. People desperately need the basics of food, water and shelter.'

So far 2,357 people have been confirmed dead and 3,853 injured. The DEC said fuel in the provincial capital of Tacloban was expected to run out within days.

Devastating: Up to 10,000 are feared dead following the category five storm which affected four million people

Calls for aid: Fuel is expected to run out in days but there is desperate need for more aid

This morning an RAF cargo plane carrying heavy duty vehicles and medical supplies left RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire as part of Britain's emergency response to the disaster.

The C-17 transport plane was carrying two JCB diggers, two Land Rovers and a forklift truck.

The aircraft, operated by No 99 Squadron, is due to land in the Philippines tomorrow morning.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening told workers and troops at Brize Norton: 'We have been one of the countries that has really been part of trying to get humanitarian aid through to the people on the ground.

'But what we know is we have to get the logistics operation up and running and that means clearing the roads.

'You cannot do that without the right equipment. We've got the right equipment and we're sending it over.'

She added: 'I think we'll be working with the Philippines over the coming months, possibly years.'

A 12-strong team of British doctors, surgeons and paramedics landed in the capital, Manila, yesterday to help treat survivors of the typhoon, the Department for International Development (DfID) said.
