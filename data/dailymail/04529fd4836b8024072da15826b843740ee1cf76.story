An elementary school teacher from Lafayatte, Colorado stood up to the school's board about a policy towards poor children she felt was 'disrespectful.' A few weeks later she was fired.

Noelle Roni, elementary school principal at the Peak to Peak Charter School of 9 years, believes she was fired because very publicly objected to students with no money in their lunch accounts having to get their hands stamped.

Roni believes that school board politics are to blame for her termination and she is fighting to get her job back, reports CBS.

Roni opposed the school board's decision to make kids with no lunch money in their account have their hands stamped for other children to see

'The kids are humiliated. They’re branded. It’s disrespectful. Where’s the human compassion? And these are little children,' she told CBS.

Roni felt that if students had to have their hands stamped based on socioeconomic differences, they would be bullied by their peers and made to feel uncomfortable.

Parents from the school met at a local church in Erie on Monday to talk about potentially revoking two of the school's board members.

'I feel she was bullied, and we want her back,' one parent told CBS

Roni told reporters that she'd had heated discussions with the school board before but that she was taken aback by their reaction.

'I was shocked that their reaction was not outrage. That it was more of ‘Who are you to tell us not to do this?’ ' she said.

CBS spoke with the school's attorney Barry Arrington who said that the school wont discuss their reason for firing Roni in depth but that her allegations are 'absurd.'

'Three outside lawyers agree her claims are baseless,' Arrington said in a statement.

Roni says she isn't afraid to sue the school.

'If we have to, we’ll file suit,' she said. 'When I see something that I feel harms children, I speak up,' she continued.

Roni's staff bio is still on the school's website. 'I look forward to working together, as a community, to meet the needs of every child,' she writes.

Roni became the elementary school principal in 2005. Before that she was an elementary principal, teacher, amd couselor in Seattle reports The Daily Camera.

Peak to Peak's K-12 assistant principal Melissa Christensen was named the acting elementary school principal.
