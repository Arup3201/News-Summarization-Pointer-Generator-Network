McDonald’s is offering an avocado-topped beef burger in select U.S. cities to test its potential popularity.

Locations in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Denver, Colorado are trialling the guacamole burger alongside a guacamole grilled chicken sandwich and guacamole crispy chicken sandwich.

All three sandwiches include guacamole, pico de gallo, white cheddar cheese, and lettuce.

According to The Daily Meal, the guacamole burger is available for $4.79 - which is noticeably more expensive than many of McDonald’s dollar offerings.

Locations in Denver are also offering guacamole as an add-on or dip for an additional 89 cents.

It is understood that McDonald’s is testing the item as a ‘healthy’ alternative to its less nutritious options like barbeque sauce.

It is unclear what ingredients the company may have added to the avocado in its guacamole recipe. It is also unknown if and when the guacamole may become a permanent menu option nationwide.

This is not the first time that McDonald’s has offered avocado on its menu.

In 2010, the fast food chain introduced chicken flatbreads with an avocado topping but quickly removed the item from its menus.

McDonald’s is not the first fast-food chain to recently add avocado to its menu. In 2013, Subway added pureed avocado to its sandwich board as a topping option.
