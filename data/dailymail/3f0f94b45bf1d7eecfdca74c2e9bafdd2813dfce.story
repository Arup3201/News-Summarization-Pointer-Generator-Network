This is the heart-stopping moment a search and rescue helicopter carrying five firefighters crashed into a block of flats in South Korea.

The chopper was returning to its headquarters in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, after a search mission for 11 people still 
missing from the April 16 sinking of the ferry Sewol off the 
southwestern coast.

But it got into trouble as it flew over Gwangju yesterday, in the southeast of the country, and plummeted to earth, slamming into a residential area in a ball of flame.

Tragically, none of its five occupants survived.

'A plume of black smoke rose with a loud bang,' said one. 'I thought it was thunder and lightning.'

Miraculously, there were no reports of any casualties on the ground apart from a female high-school student who sustained minor injuries after being hit by a piece of debris.
