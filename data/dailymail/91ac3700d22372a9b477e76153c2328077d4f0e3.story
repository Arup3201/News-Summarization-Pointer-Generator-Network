Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, has revealed goalkeeper Hope Solo is at risk of being left out of the team for this year's Women's World Cup.

The two-time Olympic gold medallist is currently serving a 30-day ban from the national team and was banned last week, two days after she was in the passenger seat when her husband was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol in Los Angeles

The suspension came a week after Solo, 33, was cleared of charges in a domestic violence case.

'There are a number of things that Hope is being asked to do in that 30 days, and we're not going to get into the specifics of that,' Gulati said. 'Then we'll evaluate where things stand.' 

Solo, who has a record 77 clean sheets from 161 matches for the USA, will miss friendly matches against France on February 8 and England five days later.

'She's been given time to deal with some issues and we think that in this period she will certainly start that process,' added Gulati.

Asked if he could imagine a circumstance where Hope would not be in the World Cup team, Gulati added: 'Sure. We hope she's making progress and joins the team. That's the goal, hers and ours.'
