Jos Buttler may just be a very English kind of sporting hero. It’s not that we expect our heroes to bash 85 from 83 balls on Test debut, as Buttler did in Southampton on Monday. It’s that we seem to prefer it when they’re humble — no matter how misplaced the humility.

Two months ago, after Buttler had thrashed 121 off 74 balls in a one-day international against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, he suggested: ‘I’m probably not ready for Test cricket — that is my honest opinion, and it’s the opinion of others.’

In fairness, his captain Alastair Cook had just ventured the same view. But the effect was profound. Here was the most exciting talent in English cricket playing down his own prospects. 

Take a bow: Jos Buttler hit 85 runs off 83 balls on his Test debut against India

If you can whack the ball regularly for six and do it self-deprecatingly, you are — in the eyes of the English sporting public — halfway there.

The scene was perfectly set as  Buttler walked out to embark on a Test career that already looks as if it will spell the end for Matt Prior.

England were 420 for five and in search of a pick-me-up after losing three for 65 either side of lunch.

Ideally, they wanted 550 before declaring — as quickly as possible. Over to Buttler.

Having got his head round the fact that he was ‘closer than perhaps I thought’ to being ready for Test cricket, he had prepared for this match by pledging to stick to his natural game.

This can also include a certain looseness outside off stump, however, and Buttler was still yet to score when  he prodded Bhuvneshwar Kumar  low down to Ajinkya Rahane at  second slip.

Lucky? Jos Buttler escaped several umpire decisions in Southampton

The chance probably carried, but TV umpire Rob Bailey discerned enough doubt. Buttler celebrated his reprieve by bunting Ravindra Jadeja over mid-off for four, then scything his next ball over the covers — a miscue, as it turned out, but a profitable one.

After that, a generous Ageas Bowl crowd lapped up all the fun of the fair. There were more missed opportunities as he chanced his arm: Shikhar  Dhawan dropped him at first slip  on 23, while India’s skipper MS Dhoni bungled a decent stumping chance when he was on 59.

But in between was an exhilarating taste of the years ahead. After taking 50 balls over his first 26 runs, he decided to bat as if he was masterminding a one-day run-chase for  Lancashire.

Jadeja was reverse-swept for four with the kind of power most batsmen summon up for their conventional sweep, then launched back over his head for six.

Soon after, debutant seamer Pankaj Singh was deposited for 20 in five balls, including two leg-side heaves for six.

By the time Buttler chopped on against Jadeja, he had thrashed 59 off his last 33 deliveries, and the spring in India’s step had long gone.

There are sure to be pitfalls along the way. He may need a bit of luck from time to time, and his wicketkeeping will get better.

But, for a dressing room in need of a shot of adrenaline, this was just the ticket.

Buttler survived after edging Bhuvneshwar Kumar behind before he had scored a run.

Ajinkya Rahane caught the ball low at second slip and India celebrated but the umpires — unsure if the ball had hit the floor first — referred the decision to third umpire Rob Bailey.

After several replays, he decided there was enough doubt to give Buttler not out...
