The matchball from one of the most iconic and infamous matches in World Cup history will be auctioned next week, with an estimated value of £15,000.

England – on their way to victory on home soil in 1966 – beat Argentina 1-0 at Wembley in a quarter-final best remembered for the sending-off of opposition captain Antonio Rattin.

The family of German referee Rudolf Kreitlein inherited the ball – which had been in his living-room since 1966 – following his death in 2012 and now it - along with other pieces of his memorabilia from the tournament in England – will go under the hammer in the German town of Kassel. 

The items, belonging to Rudolf, Rreitlein are being sold in Germany at auction by Agon

The items include the match whistle, match card and fan mail from all over the world

10. Five different invitations for Kreitlein to attend official receptions during the 1966 World Cup, including an invitation of Prime Minister Harold Wilson for a reception on July 9, 1966

11. Kreitlein's original World Cup ID, 'REFEREE', numbered '13'

14. Kreitlein's note card with his handwritten notes of the match plus the original pencil on a ribbon

The match was described by Argentines as the 'Robbery of the Century', while England boss Alf Ramsey refused to allow the players to swap shirts and would later describe the visitors as 'animals'.

Kreitlein dismissed Rattin for dissent before half-time having earlier cautioned him for a foul on Bobby Charlton, but the skipper refused to leave the field and the Spanish-speaking player insisted that a translator be called amid a 10-minute hold-up.

He did eventually depart escorted by police before scrunching the corner-flag – carrying a Union Jack – in his hand. The Argentinians later claimed there was a conspiracy between the English and the Germans to have them eliminated from the competition.

Geoff Hurst scored the winning goal 12 minutes from time as England made it through to the last four – where they beat Portugal – before defeating West Germany in the final.

After the quarter-final Kreitlein had the ball signed by all of the England players – although those signatures have now faded – and had it inscribed with details of the game and decorated with a sticker of official mascot World Cup Willie.

The ball will be joined at the auction by Kreitlein’s whistle and notebook from the match, a medal of honour to mark his involvement at the finals, press photos of the sending-off and Kreitlein being led away by police after the game, as well as postcards sent to his wife in which he describes his performance during the quarter-final.

Kreitlein, along with Ken Aston, the English supervisor of referees during the game, are credited with the introduction of yellow and red cards as a means of communicating better with players in light of the Rattin incident.

The auction takes place on Saturday, December 13 and includes World Cup and European Championships memorabilia dating from 1930 to 2014.

Advance bids can be made and more details can be found at www.agon-auction.com, where all lots are listed.
