The ITV studio was pelted with rocks and its glass cracked by protesters during its World Cup coverage of Brazil vs Croatia as riots continued to wreak havoc.

Demonstrators have been protesting throughout the day against money spent on the tournament in Brazil and the ITV team, led by host Adrian Chiles, were targeted next to the Copacabana beah in Rio.

Brazil won 3-1 and its opening ceremony proved a Samba celebration, but the protests continue to prove worrying for its officials with the World Cup barely a day old.
