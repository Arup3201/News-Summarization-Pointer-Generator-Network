While the catwalks are housed at Lincoln Center, and more recently, Chelsea's Milk Studios, fashion's elite aren't shy about making the rest of the concrete jungle their playground.

In between front row appearances at the shows, celebrities hurry to star-studded after-parties, opulent dinners and must-attend red carpet events sprawled out around the city.

And when they're looking for a few moments of down time, there are a bevy of luxurious hotel offerings to choose from.
