Mark Zuckerberg has picked a fight with the boss of Apple by calling his recent criticism of the social network 'ridiculous'.

The Facebook founder told Tim Cook to make products like the iPhone and the iPad cheaper if he wanted to be more in touch with his consumers.

In an interview Zuckerberg, 30, also revealed he upbraided Bill Gates over some comments in a magazine and confronted the 59-year-old Microsoft founder by saying: 'What's up dude?'

The article in TIME magazine details how Zuckerberg is not content with having more than one billion Facebook users - he wants to connect the whole world.

But picking a fight with Cook means that he has one less partner with which to do it.

Zuckerberg said: 'A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers…

'...I think it's the most ridiculous concept.

'What, you think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them?

'If you were in alignment with them, then they'd make their products a lot cheaper!'

Cook has inherited Apple founder Steve Jobs' legacy as the company's mouthpiece in chief and has sharply criticised its rivals in the past.

'You think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them?, said Mark Zuckerberg in a recent interview.

He has said that he is 'offended' by the privacy breaches carried out by its arch rival Google and that he runs a 'very different company' to them.

In September he attacked Facebook for harvesting information about users 'to sell to advertisers'

Zuckerberg said that he spoke to Gates after he apparently criticised Internet.org, the home page for his global partnership for expanding Internet access.

He said: 'I talked to him after that...I called him up and I was like, 'What's up, dude?'

'But he was misquoted, and he even corrected it afterward. He was like, 'No, I fully believe that this is critical.'

Internet.org was unveiled earlier on this year and is a partnership between Zuckerberg and six major mobile phone companies.

Its aim is to give everyone on the world Internet access and is developing advanced technologies to make it happen.

Lawyers have claimed that each time a user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their phones and iPods, between 2007 and 2009 (Steve Jobs is pictured launching the 2009 iPod Nano), the tech firm urged them to restore their devices to factory settings. This is said to have been a deliberate move to wipe the rival files

For at least two years, Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores, according to accusations made in court.

Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings.

And lawyers claim this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' 

Apple has been taken to court by individuals and businesses who accuse it of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market.

The suit is being heard in a US district court in California, and is specifically looking into whether Apple tried to bolster its iPod and iTunes market between 2007 and 2009.

The plaintiffs are seeking $350 million (£223 million) in damages, claiming that Apple’s behaviour forced them to pay more for songs and hardware.

Apple is also accused of inflating the prices of its iPods by almost $350 million (£223 million). The group declined to comment on legal proceedings.  

Zuckerberg: 'We were thinking about the first decade of the company (Facebook), and what were the next set of big things that we wanted to take on, and we came to this realization that connecting a billion people is an awesome milestone, but there's nothing magical about the number 1 billion.

'If your mission is to connect the world, then a billion might just be bigger than any other service that had been built. But that doesn't mean that you're anywhere near fulfilling the actual mission.

'We feel like this is just an important thing for the world…. and there are no steps that are clear steps to make this an awesome business or to have it fully rolled out across the world, but I'm pretty confident we can do it. I'm pretty confident it's going to be a good thing.'
