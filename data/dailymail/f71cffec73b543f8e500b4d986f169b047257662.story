The daughter and son-in-law of an elderly couple who disappeared 15 years ago have been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged with the murders.

William and Patricia Wycherley, who police said would now be aged 100 and 79 respectively, disappeared from Mansfield in 1998.

Police last month found remains buried in the back garden of a house in Blenheim Close in Forest Town, Mansfield. Formal identification has yet to be confirmed but they are believed to be those of Mr and Mrs Wycherley.

The daughter and son-in-law of an elderly couple found in this garden in Forest Town, Mansfield, are due to appear in court today charged with their murders

Nottinghamshire Police are 
still waiting for forensic tests to confirm the remains are those of the
Wycherleys, but detectives are 'confident' the skeletons discovered in 
the back garden belong to the pair

They lived at the house in the 1990s and, according to neighbours, disappeared in 1998.

Post-mortem examinations on the remains revealed that each person died as a result of being shot.

The
couple's daughter, Susan Patricia Edwards, 55, and her husband 
Christopher John Edwards, 57, were last night each charged with two 
counts of murder.

The pair, 
of no fixed address, were arrested at St Pancras International railway 
station in London on Wednesday evening on suspicion of the murders, 
Nottinghamshire Police said.

Appearing
at Nottingham Magistrates' Court this morning for a brief hearing, 
Susan Edwards, wearing a black sweater and trousers, spoke only to 
confirm her name, age and address.

Her husband, dressed in burgundy trousers, a black sweater and wearing glasses, also confirmed the same details from the dock.

The
court heard they are both jointly charged with the murders of Mr and 
Mrs Wycherley between May 1, 1998 and May 31 of the same year.

No application for bail was made and both defendants were remanded in custody to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday.

Mr and Mrs Wycherley moved into the house in 1987.

Neighbours said Mr Wycherley, a former merchant sailor who would now be 100, and his wife, who would now be 79, ‘disappeared’ from the property in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in the late 1990s.

Rumours later circulated locally and within their extended family that the couple had moved to either Ireland or to the Lancashire coast.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
