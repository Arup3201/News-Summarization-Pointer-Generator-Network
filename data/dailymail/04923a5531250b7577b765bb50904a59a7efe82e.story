President Barack Obama sided with open-Internet activists on Monday, urging the Federal Communications
Commission to draft new rules that would reclassify the broadband net to
regulate it more like a public utility.

The end result would tie the hands of Internet service providers that want to cut special deals with services like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and Amazon to push their streaming content along a 'fast lane' that ordinary Americans can't access.

The FCC has been working on the new rule for seven months, and has received nearly 4 million comments from the public.

Its first attempt at a 'net neutrality' rule met with the judicial axe in January with a federal court sided with Verizon and ruled that the government agency lacks the legal authority to control how Internet companies set their prices.

President Barack Obama announced a full-court press Monday on 'net neutrality,' a policy that would prohibit Internet service providers from playing favorites as they allocate resources online

REBRANDING: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is already framing Net Neutrality in a way that connects it to the president's increasingly unpopular medical insurance overhaul

Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a framework this year that prohibited Internet
service providers like Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner Cable from blocking any content, but allowed deals
where content providers would pay ISPs to ensure smooth delivery
of traffic.

Wheeler said in April that his FCC would propose that 'broadband providers would be required to offer a baseline level of service to their subscribers, along with the ability to enter into individual negotiations with content providers.'

'In all instances, broadband providers would need to act in a commercially reasonable manner subject to review on a case-by-case basis.'

Obama campaigned on the issue of net neutrality. He said in a statement Monday that the FCC's new rules should explicitly ban any paid
prioritization deals. 

'Simply put: No service should be stuck in a 'slow lane'
because it does not pay a fee,' Obama said. 'That kind of gatekeeping would
undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet's
growth.'

'I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules
protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable
company nor the phone company will be able to act as a
gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online.'

He also said the FCC should apply its new rules equally to
mobile and wired ISPs. 

Two GOP senators pushed back – hard.

Net neutrality 'puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities, and higher prices for consumers,' Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz wrote on Facebook.

'"Net Neutrality" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government,' he added on Twitter.

South Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune said Obama's vision relied on 'rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service.'

'The president’s stale thinking would invite legal and marketplace uncertainty and perpetuate what has needlessly become a politically corrosive policy debate.'

The move Obama seeks would rely on Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, a law that never contemplated life in the Internet age.  

MEANWHILE, 13 TIME ZONES AWAY: Obama avoided questions about his Net Neutrality position by having the White House release a statement while he was in China

The National Cable and Telecommunications Association, a trade group that represents broadband providers, said it was 'stunned the president would abandon the longstanding, bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the Internet and calling for extreme Title II regulation.'

In taking a position in favor of net neutrality, Obama is siding with liberal activist groups that want the FCC to put ISPs in a new category so that they can be
regulated more like public utilities.

One such group, CREDO, is a self-described 'progressive mobile phone provider' that operates more like a nonprofit than an ISP.

'This is huge,' CREDO political director Becky Bond said Monday in a statement. 

'President Obama just proved whose side he is on – that of the American people and an open and equal Internet.'

'Obama’s statement is simply a cynical political ploy, a way of playing to activists on the radical Left who have built mailing lists and a political movement on the most absolutist conception of net neutrality,' the libertarian think tank TechFreedom said in a statement.  

'There is no dispute about the propriety of transparency rules and bans on discrimination and blocking. But this tectonic shift in national policy, should it be adopted, would create devastating results.'

Obama waited to announce his position until after the midterm election. The White House emailed the news to reporters while the president was in China for a Trans-Pacific Partnership meeting.

'An open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known.

'"Net neutrality" has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation – but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas. That is why today, I am asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.

'When I was a candidate for this office, I made clear my commitment to a free and open Internet, and my commitment remains as strong as ever. Four years ago, the FCC tried to implement rules that would protect net neutrality with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies that make important investments in our economy. After the rules were challenged, the court reviewing the rules agreed with the FCC that net neutrality was essential for preserving an environment that encourages new investment in the network, new online services and content, and everything else that makes up the Internet as we now know it. Unfortunately, the court ultimately struck down the rules – not because it disagreed with the need to protect net neutrality, but because it believed the FCC had taken the wrong legal approach.

'The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone. I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online. The rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the Internet you and I use every day, and that some ISPs already observe. These bright-line rules include:

'If carefully designed, these rules should not create any undue burden for ISPs, and can have clear, monitored exceptions for reasonable network management and for specialized services such as dedicated, mission-critical networks serving a hospital. But combined, these rules mean everything for preserving the Internet’s openness.

'The rules also have to reflect the way people use the Internet today, which increasingly means on a mobile device. I believe the FCC should make these rules fully applicable to mobile broadband as well, while recognizing the special challenges that come with managing wireless networks.

'To be current, these rules must also build on the lessons of the past. For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business. That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information – whether a phone call, or a packet of data.

'So the time has come for the FCC to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. To do that, I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act – while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services. This is a basic acknowledgment of the services ISPs provide to American homes and businesses, and the straightforward obligations necessary to ensure the network works for everyone – not just one or two companies.

'Investment in wired and wireless networks has supported jobs and made America the center of a vibrant ecosystem of digital devices, apps, and platforms that fuel growth and expand opportunity. Importantly, network investment remained strong under the previous net neutrality regime, before it was struck down by the court; in fact, the court agreed that protecting net neutrality helps foster more investment and innovation. If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above – principles that most ISPs have followed for years – it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the Internet.

'The Internet has been one of the greatest gifts our economy – and our society – has ever known. The FCC was chartered to promote competition, innovation, and investment in our networks. In service of that mission, there is no higher calling than protecting an open, accessible, and free Internet. I thank the Commissioners for having served this cause with distinction and integrity, and I respectfully ask them to adopt the policies I have outlined here, to preserve this technology’s promise for today, and future generations to come.'
