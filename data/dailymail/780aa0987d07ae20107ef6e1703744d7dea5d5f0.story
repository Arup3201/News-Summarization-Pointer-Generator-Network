The U.S. Department of Education has released the findings of a 10-year study that reveal almost one in four - 22.6 per cent - of 26-year-olds are still living with their parents.

The First Look report followed 13,000 high school sophomores in 2002 through to 2012, when they were all about 26 years old.

The statistics give an insight into the lives and living arrangements of millennials, who entered adulthood during the recession.

Still at home: The study shows that almost a quarter of 26-year-olds are still living with their parents

The study found that 19 per cent of respondents were living alone, while 42 per cent were living with a spouse or partner.

Just 10 per cent were living with roommates as opposed to the almost 23 per cent who were living with their parents.

The remaining six per cent had some other living arrangement.

According to Pew Research analysis of the 2012 data, rising unemployment 
and college enrollment are bases for the trend, as well as a decrease in young people getting married.

The work and study situations of the 2002 high schoolers were telling. Overall, those with more school were less likely to still be living at home.

Recession: Rising unemployment during the recession is cited as one reason for the increase in young adults residing at home

According to the data, 19 per cent of the group reported they were both working for pay and taking post-secondary courses, while 13 per cent said they were neither working for pay nor studying.

Sixty-three per cent were working for pay only, and five per cent were taking post-secondary courses only.

By 2012, 33 per cent of those surveyed had earned a bachelors degree or higher.

College education: According tothe report, university graduates are less likely to still live at home and less likely to experience unemployment

A full 40 per cent of those who had only a high school diploma and 45 per cent of those who had not finished high school reported having lost a job since January 2006 as opposed to 19 per cent of those with a bachelor's degree or higher had lost a job.

Money was a real source of worry for the respondents, 53.8 per cent of whom had made less than $25,000 from employment in 2011.

According to a Pew Research Center study released in 2013, 36 per cent of young adults aged 18 - 31 are now living with their parents, which is the highest percentage in four decades.
