Parishioners must write to their MP and urge them to block the Government's plans to allow gay marriages, says the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales.

The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols has also expressed his fears that the 'the true nature of marriage' will be lost on schoolchildren if the legislation is voted in.

He says worshippers must write soon and 'clearly, calmly and forcefully' lay out their concerns about the plans, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Protest: The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols wants Catholics to write to their MPs expressing their concerns about gay marriage plans

He said: 'At this time, we look to our Members of Parliament to defend, not change, the bond of man and woman in marriage as the essential element of the vision of the family.

'I urge everyone who cares about upholding the meaning of marriage in civil law to make their views known to their Members of Parliament, clearly, calmly and forcefully.

'Please do so as soon as possible.'

It is the first time he has written directly to parishioners asking them to lobby MPs.

His warnings are the latest attack from a senior member of the Catholic Church on David Cameron's plans to allow gay couples to marry in churches.

Yesterday the Archbishop of Birmingham Bernard Longley released a letter stating: 'Government policy cannot foresee the full consequences, for the children involved or for wider society, of being brought up by two mothers without a father’s influence or by two fathers without a mother’s influence.

'We first learn about diversity and acquire a respect for difference through the complementarity of our parents.'

He describes the 'complementary love of father and mother' as a 'precious gift that we should wish for every child'.

Criticism: Catholics must act to try and change the minds of politicians throughout the UK

Archbishop Longley added: 'We know that many single parents courageously and generously look after their children and often struggle to give them a fine up-bringing.

'If it had not been for the 
understanding of St Joseph, our Lady herself might have had to face the 
difficulties of being a single parent.

'Even
so, the experience of growing up with our father and mother to teach 
and guide, to console and love us unconditionally is an invaluable 
blessing in life.'

The attacks from leading Catholics come despite the fact polls show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay couples to marry.

Civil partnerships - which come with most, but not all, of the legal safeguards of marriage - were introduced seven years ago.

They allow gay couples to celebrate their unions in civil settings, but not in religious buildings, but the Government now wants to allow them to call their unions marriage and have the ceremony in civil and religious locations.
