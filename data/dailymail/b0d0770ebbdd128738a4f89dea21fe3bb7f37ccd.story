Ched Evans's move to Oldham Athletic is set to collapse after manager Lee Johnson expressed grave reservations over signing the convicted rapist.

The former Sheffield United striker, 26, was set to train with the Latics on Monday ahead of a press conference to announce his arrival at Boundary Park.

However, Evans was not seen at the Chapel Road training ground and Sportsmail understands Latics boss Johnson has made known his concerns about going through with the controversial swoop.

Despite his own reservations, Johnson later publicly said that he will support whatever the decision taken by the board. He said: 'Very difficult circumstances for everyone, it's a board decision from now on.

'Very difficult situation, but of course we want what's best for the club and whatever the board decide, I'll support.'

Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner, urged the club not to sign Evans.

Lloyd  said: 'Oldham Athletic Football Club should not sign Ched Evans.

'Ched Evans is a convicted rapist and, whilst I strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation, it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract.

'All offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence, but Ched Evans’ lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offence means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a Greater Manchester football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model, especially to young people.'

Club sponsor Verlin said on Monday that it will terminate any involvement with Oldham should the club go through with the signing.

Verling told Press Association Sport: 'The club know our stance and that is if they sign or allow Ched Evans to train we will be out of the door.

'We had a conversation with the club when they considered allowing Ched Evans to train with them six to eight weeks ago, and we were led to believe they had listened to the general input.

'But our sources have made it clear he will be training or signing for the club this week and it is not something we wish to be associated with.'

Another Oldham sponsor, Mecca Bingo, also confirmed they would end their involvement with the club if Evans signed. 

The company tweeted: 'We can confirm will (sic) be ending our association with @OfficialOAFC if they sign Ched Evans.' 

Just hours after the news emerged on Sunday an online petition against the move became one of the fastest-growing ever and has attracted more than 24,000 signatures. 

More than one person per second signed the petition in the first thirty minutes after its launch.

It is one of the quickest growing on change.org, according to i100.co.uk.

Ex-Sheffield United striker Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October

An online petition has been started urging Oldham to not sign Evans and has received 24,000 signatures

Addressed to Simon Corney, the chairman of Oldham Athletic FC, the petition reads: 'We do believe he [Ched Evans] has the right to work.

'We believe that it does not have to be in a role where he influences views about sexual violence, and his presence on your pitch will do this.'

Evans wants a return to football after being released from prison in October.

He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011 but has protested his innocence.

Senior officials at Oldham are understood to believe Evans' side of the story. They spoke to the player in late November but decided against making a move amid fears it would further tarnish the club's image following the signing of Lee Hughes in 2007.

Hughes had served half of a six-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. Director Barry Owen, a former police officer instrumental in bringing Hughes to Oldham, is understood to have been heavily involved in the move for Evans.

Since defeating Rochdale 3-0 on November 29 Oldham's season has suffered a dramatic downturn. Lee Johnson's side have lost four games in a row including a 4-0 home humbling by his dad's Yeovil Town and a 7-0 drubbing at MK Dons.

Professional Footballer's Association (PFA) chief executive Gordon Taylor said there would be a press conference at an unnamed League One club to unveil Evans on Monday but Sportsmail understands those plans were put on hold on Sunday.

Taylor told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme he would not be able to attend the press conference - an announcement that is thought to have disappointed Oldham officials who had hoped for his support.

According to one board member of Trust Oldham, the official club supporters trust that has a stake in the club and even provides financial support that can extend to the payment of a player's wages, they have not been consulted about the possible recruitment of Evans.

Ray Coverley told Sportsmail he knew nothing of Evans joining the club. Speaking personally and not on behalf of Trust Oldham, he did however argue that – having served his sentence for rape – Evans was entitled to return to work as a footballer.

Maltese side Hibernians announced on Friday that they had offered Evans, who has had an investigation into his case by the Criminal Cases Review Commission fast-tracked, a deal but that move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice as Evans is not allowed to work abroad.

He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of the PFA.

But following a backlash from supporters, sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer.

Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Tony Lloyd, is calling on Oldham Athletic Football Club not to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Tony said: 'Oldham Athletic Football Club should not sign Ched Evans.

'Ched Evans is a convicted rapist and, whilst I strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation, it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract.

'All offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence, but Ched Evans’ lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offence means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a Greater Manchester football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model, especially to young people.'

Evans' attempts to return have so far been fruitless, with clubs turning down the chance to employ him
