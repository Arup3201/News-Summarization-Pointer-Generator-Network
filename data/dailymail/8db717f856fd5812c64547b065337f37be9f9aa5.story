If that sinister stare doesn’t remind you of someone, the slick of black hair and moustache should give you a clue.

This is Poppy, whose resemblance to Adolf Hitler turns heads as she prowls the streets near her home in Sevenoaks, Kent.

Owner Kate Magee said: ‘She’s lovely. It’s unfortunate she looks like a dictator.’

Poppy is the latest in a line of feline Fuhrers, including one, Kitler from Cambridgeshire, that even seemed to salute.

Meanwhile, a puppy, a stink bug and even a house in Swansea, South Wales, have been likened to the dictator.

Mrs Magee and her two daughters Anna, 17, and Katherine, 10, had spotted locals taking photos of the six-year-old black and white moggy as she was out and about, but couldn't work out why.

It was only when Mrs Magee was chatting to her parish priest that she realised her cat was the spitting image of the Nazi dictator, complete with toothbrush moustache and black side-parting.

She says the priest told her Poppy was a dead ringer for the fascist leader - which was why locals were taking pictures of her.

Mrs Magee said: 'I was speaking to the priest (about why Poppy was so popular) and he just said to me: "Your cat looks like Hitler."

'She was a kitten when we first got her and her markings weren't very pronounced.

It's him: Black markings on the back of the stink bug look like the hair, eyes and even moustache of the evil German dictator

'She changed as she got older but it was so gradual we never noticed - and we weren't exactly looking for tell-tale signs that she would grow to look like Hitler.'

She added: 'As soon as the resemblance was pointed out to us, there was no escaping it. Now we can't help noticing Hitler every time we look at her.

'We're worried she'll develop a complex if people laugh and point at her.'
