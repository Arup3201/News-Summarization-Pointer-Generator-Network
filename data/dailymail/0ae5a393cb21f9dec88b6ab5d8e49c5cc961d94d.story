If you imagine spies are recruited with a discreet tap on the shoulder in the colleges of Oxford or Cambridge, think again.

For the first time, the secret services are looking to recruit dozens of school-leavers for apprenticeships.

Bosses are looking for as many as 100 recruits as young as 18 to take a ‘degree in spying’ instead of going to university.

The first spy apprentices will arrive at GCHQ on the west of Cheltenham this autumn to learn how to protect Britain from the threat of cyber terrorists

They say they are keen to dispel the 
‘myth’ that a career in the intelligence services is ‘the preserve of 
privately educated men’.

The Foreign Office said it wanted to 
harness the talents of the ‘XBox generation’ who have grown up with 
social networking sites, global internet connections and interactive 
gaming.

Recruits will be mainly based at GCHQ, the electronic communications agency. But some will work for MI6 or MI5.

Web-savvy teenagers, described by the Foreign Office as being part of the 'X-box generation' are being urged to consider a career in code-breaking instead of going to university

The Foreign Office has given £480,000 to unlock £5million in funding to secure the future of Bletchley Park House in Buckinghamshire, which was home to the Enigma codebreakers during World War Two

They will be paid an unspecified salary as well as earning a foundation degree as they train.

William Hague unveiled the scheme yesterday during a visit to Bletchley Park – GCHQ’s Second World War predecessor.

The Foreign Secretary compared the 
role of the new recruits to that of the Buckinghamshire base’s famous 
‘code-breakers’, who cracked the Enigma codes used by the Nazis.

He said cyber-warfare was ‘one of the 
greatest challenges of our time’ and that he wanted to find the ‘young 
innovators’ who would be able to help confront it.

Candidates need three A-levels or 
equivalent qualification, including at least two C grades in a science, 
technology or maths subject.

They will embark on a two-year training programme which will include desk-based study as well as work placements.

They will earn a foundation degree 
course in communications, security and engineering at De Montfort 
University in Leicester as well as a level diploma in IT.

Foreign Secretary William Hague announced the apprenticeship plans at Bletchley Park, where he was presented with an Enigma machine which will be displayed in the Foreign Office

Computing machines were used to read Nazi codes at Bletchley Park, England, during World War Two. Now a new generation of maths and computing experts are being recruited by the intelligence agencies

A GCHQ spokesman said: ‘Candidates 
won’t just be working with the very latest technology, they will be 
involved in creating it.’

During his visit to Bletchley Park Mr Hague also announced funding to secure the future of the estate.

A £480,000 grant from the Foreign 
Office will release a further £5million of Heritage Lottery Funding to 
help Bletchley carry out vital restorations and create a 
state-of-the-art visitor centre and exhibitions.
