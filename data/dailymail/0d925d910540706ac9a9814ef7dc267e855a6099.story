The registered sex offender accused of abducting an 8-year-old from a Florida Walmart and then murdering her was denied bail on Sunday - as the mother of one of his previous victims said 'I wish he was dead'.

Donald James Smith, of Jacksonville, was charged Saturday with murder and kidnapping in the death of Cherish Perrywinkle.

Authorities said Smith befriended the girl and her mother while they shopped at a dollar store Friday night.

Smith took them to a Wal-Mart, where he offered to buy them clothes and hamburgers, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

Instead of buying the snacks, Smith walked out of the store with the girl, the sheriff’s office said. The girl’s mother called 911 when she noticed they were missing.

A tip led investigators to the girl’s body in the woods near a church Saturday morning. Police arrested Smith after stopping his van on Interstate 95. Authorities have not said how Cherish died.

Smith’s next court appearance is scheduled July 16.

Smith has been a registered sex offender since a 1993 conviction in Duval County for attempted kidnapping and selling obscene materials.

He has been arrested several times since then, most recently in 2009 on a charge of child abuse after making obscene phone calls to a 10-year-old girl, making verbal threats, and impersonating a social worker with the Florida Department of Children and Families who claimed to be investigating the girl’s family.

Mother Stephanie Thornton, whose daughter Christina was terrorized by Smith at the age of nine old told Action News Jax, 'I wish he was dead'.

In 2009 Smith was accused of posing as a Department of Children and Families employee in order to get close to Thornton's daughter, Christina.

'He's sick they need to electrocute him. Three weeks after you get out of jail you've done it again and killed a child,' said Thornton.

'It's hard knowing it could've happened to my daughter and that these parents have to go through this with their 8 year-old daughter,' said Thornton.

Donald James Smith of Jacksonville was taken into custody after police cornered his white van on Interstate 95.

He had only been released from jail on May 31 
after serving 438 days on felony charges of child abuse and unlawful 
impersonation of a public employee.

Donald Smith has been arrested and charged with the abduction and murder of 8-year-old Florida girl Cherish Perrywinkle

Authorities had put out an Amber Alert with details of Smith's van early Saturday, hours after receiving a 911 call from Cherish's mother about the missing girl.

Prior to the alleged abduction Friday night, Smith, 56, befriended Cherish and her mother at a dollar store, and ‘offered to take them to Wal-Mart and buy her family some clothes,’ said Mike Williams, director of investigations at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

‘They appeared to be down on their luck and he could help them out.’

After spending a couple hours inside the Wal-Mart together, Smith offered to buy hamburgers and walked with Cherish to the front of the store, Williams said.

Cherish's mom agreed to let her go with the man she had only just met whilst she 
took care of her other two children and continued browsing the shelves.

Instead of stopping to buy the snack, Smith walked Cherish outside and the two of them got into his van, Williams said.

Looking for a victim: Donald Smith, 56, had only been released from jail three weeks ago. He befriended the child's mother in a dollar store and was captured on CCTV leaving Walmart with the girl

The girl's mother called 911 when she realized Charish and Smith were missing.

Less than an hour later, Cherish was dead.

'We located the body of Cherish 
Perrywinkle,' Officer Shannon Hartley said holding back tears. 'It's a 
very difficult time, obviously, for everyone involved.'

'Hug your children closely right now and know where they're at,' Officer Hartley said. 'Keep them close.'

Detectives say that within 30 minutes of Cherish's mom realizing she had left the store with the man, police were called.

An Amber Alert was issued and police searched the area with helicopters and ground units but did not find the suspect or the girl.

A tip about a suspicious van spotted in the woods near a church led investigators to Cherish's body Saturday morning.

Meanwhile, an officer working at the scene of a traffic crash on Interstate 95 on Saturday morning recognized Smith's van as it drove past her and called it in.

Found: Cherish Lilly Perrywinkle's body was found early this morning at Highlands Church in Jacksonville, Florida

The highway was shut down while other officers pulled Smith over and arrested him. He has not cooperated with investigators, Williams said, and it was not immediately known whether he had an attorney.

Williams declined to answer reporters' questions about how Cherish died or what Smith did in the hours between his disappearance with the girl and his arrest, saying that the investigation remains open.

Smith has been a registered sex offender since a 1993 conviction in Duval County for attempted kidnapping and selling obscene materials.

Previous arrests that date as far back as 1977 when Department of Corrections records show he was convicted of indecent assault on a child under the age of 16.

Prison records also show that Smith went to prison again in 1992 for attempted kidnapping. Court documents show he was convicted of that charge in addition to two counts of showing obscene material to a minor.

In 2003 prisons records show Smith served time for trafficking in stolen property and giving false information to a pawnbroker.

She was also arrested in 2009 on a charge of child abuse after making obscene phone calls to a 10-year-old girl, making verbal threats, and impersonating a social worker with the Florida Department of Children and Families who claimed to be investigating the girl's family.

Smith pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in that case in 2012 and was released from jail on May 31 this year.

Williams said Smith had just met with police Friday morning to comply with a state law that requires sex offenders to verify their address once a year.

Smith is set to appear in court at 9 a.m. Sunday morning.
