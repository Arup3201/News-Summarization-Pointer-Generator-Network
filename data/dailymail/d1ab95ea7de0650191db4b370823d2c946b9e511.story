It's time for a spring clean. We've shrugged off our winter coats - literally and metaphorically speaking - and we're starting to enjoy fresh spring days.

It's easy to hibernate, beauty-wise, and stick with the same old look, same old products. But refreshing your kit makes total sense.

After all, you don't need heavy wind-blocking moisturisers in summer, or factor-50 hair oil throughout winter (well, not in the UK, at least!).

This week Binky shows you how to revamp your beauty routine for Spring

More than that, dark wintery days and fresh spring sunshine call for an entirely different make-up look, one that reflects the change of seasons. It's also worth remembering that beauty products have a sell-by date.

Perfumes lose their fragrance, lipsticks start to curdle and mascaras dry out over time.So clear out all those stubby eye pencils and crumbling blushers. It's time for a beauty reboot!

BINKY'S SPRING KIT

Guerlain Terracotta Skin Healthy Glow Foundation

You guys already know what a huge fan I am of Guerlain's Terracotta bronzer. Well this little beauty gives the sheer coverage of a powder foundation, as well as adding that radiant glow the celebrated bronzer is famous for.

It has a light, powdery texture and leaves your skin looking fresh, flawless and lightly sun-kissed. This is such a perfect product for me, you could call it Binky in a bottle!

Binky recommends using these Bumble and Bumble products to repair your hair from winter damage

Daniel Sandler - Watercolour Creme Bronzer in Riviera

You
 won't be the least bit surprised to read this recommendation. I've 
already mentioned my bronzer addiction, and regular readers will know 
how highly I rate Daniel Sandler's Watercolour products - so this is a 
no-brainer for me.

I've
 been using it both to contour my face and also to give my sallow 
post-winter skin and instant healthy spring flush. It looks great on, 
and its creamy, blendable texture makes it a dream to apply. Be quick, 
though - this is a limited-edition product, and I for one am stocking 
up!

Bumble & Bumble - Thickening Creme Contour

Winter's twin evils of cold weather and central heating can leave locks looking dry, dull and flat, so this beauty booster is a real spring savior.

The lightweight formula adds body to hair, making it look full, textured and shiny. Perfect for those who love the volume and glamour of a professional blow-dry but without don't want to look too "done".

Bumble & Bumble - Hairdresser's Invisible Oil

Another
 treat for your crowning glory, this is a real beauty insider's 
favourite; you won't find many pro stylists without a bottle in their 
kit - hence the name. This is a bit of a miracle product - it tames 
flyaway strands, reduces frizz, detangles the hair and strengthens 
against breakage.

Its lightweight blend of oils combine to provide 
moisture, softness and shine, while added sunscreen filters and heat 
protection help combat dryness. Invest in a bottle and your hair will 
love you for it!

Clarins - Instant Light Eye Perfecting Base

The
 skin around your eyes is incredibly delicate, which explains why it's 
the first area to show up signs of ageing, or simply tell the world when
 you're tired, run-down and under the weather.

Moisturisers
 and plumpers will look after the under-eye area, and this fabulous 
formulation attends to your lids, camouflaging shadows and creating a 
flawless base for your make-up, ensuring eye shadow lasts longer.

Best
 of all, its anti-pollution complex will protect your delicate skin 
against free radicals, keeping you looking younger for longer!

Binky says that she has started to increase her fitness regime as hemlines are getting shorter

BareMinerals - Ready Eyeshadow Palette in The Next Big Thing

I
 could tell you all about how this product harnesses the rejuvenating 
power of sea minerals to revitalise your eye area, reduce fine lines and
 combat puffiness.

But
 all I need to say is take a look at the gorgeous shades inside! 
Delicate sorbet shades and subtle bronze hues are totally on-trend this 
season, which means your make-up will be as fashion-forward as your 
wardrobe!

Daniel Sandler - Watercolour Blusher in Truth

I
 can never get enough of Daniel Sandler's amazing Watercolour make-up 
products. I've already mentioned his limited-edition bronzer and this is
 the classic Watercolour Blusher. Thoroughly deserving of its cult 
status, it's a dream to apply, easy to blend in and it lasts all day 
long.

I wear the soft nude shade called Truth, and once you find your favourite colour, believe me, you'll be hooked just like I am.

Binky has been using Forza Raspberry K2 supplements to help shed the excess pounds

BareMinerals - Advanced Protection Tinted Moisturiser

Tinted moisturiser is a perfect springtime product. Once the weather warms up, I don't fancy layering on loads of foundation, so this lightweight formula is ideal.

It keeps my skin looks fresh, glowing and healthy, with an even tone and a hint of colour. It's good for your complexion, too, offering SPF 20 protection and delivering essential antioxidants and minerals.

Forza Raspberry K2 Supplements

The weather's getting warmer and hemlines are getting shorter, so I'm starting to up the ante on my fitness regime. As well as regular exercise sessions at home and at the gym, I've been taking these Forza Raspberry K2 supplements to help shed the excess pounds.

These amazing fat-burning pills stop me reaching for naughty snacks in the afternoon. I highly recommend you try these out if you're looking to get in shape for the summer â€“ I've seen some really promising results so far.

It's truly great to have a good old clear-out and then to treat yourself to some gorgeous new kit. I feel so refreshed by the whole process, I reckon I'm already looking better even before I apply my new products! You can get all the beauty bits I mentioned from online beauty boutique escentual.com, and the Forza supplements are available in Boots and Superdrug.

I also wanted to tell you about one of my recent fashion favourites! As you may know by now, I'm a huge fan of lingerie brand Bluebella.

I recently treated myself to a few pieces from their gorgeous SS14 collection - my current favourite for spring is the sizzling Lara bra and briefs duo.

I adore the bright fuschia satin, and the cheeky lace detailing seriously amps up the sex factor!

Check out the full range at Bluebella.com or in Selfridges stores - they have the perfect undies for everyone, whether you're looking for something casual and playful or sultry and seductive.

Until next week, stay gorgeous

Love Binky
