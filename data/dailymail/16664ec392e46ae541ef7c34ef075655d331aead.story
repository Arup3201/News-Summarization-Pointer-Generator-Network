Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick Paul Ryan in the end failed to help his running mate win the White House last night, and to add insult to injury, the rising star of the Republican Party was left embarrassed after losing his home state of Wisconsin.

However, the congressman's night was not a complete loss as he easily won re-election to the U.S. House seat he has held since 1998 and received a ringing endorsement from his running mate.

In his concession speech early Wednesday morning, Romney lavished praised on his would-be vice president for all he has done for their campaign over the past year.

Passing the baton: In his concession speech, Romney, center, praised Ryan and expressed hope that his 'commitment to principle will continue to contribute top the good of our nation''Besides my wife, Ann, Paul is the best choice I’ve ever made,' Romney gushed in his brief yet gracious remarks. 'And
I trust that his intellect and his hard work and his commitment to 
principle will continue to contribute to the good of our nation.'

Even before he was tapped as Romney's
No 2, Ryan was regarded as one of the GOP's 'young guns.' As chairman 
of the powerful House Budget Committee, he gained prominence when he 
drew up an austere budget blueprint that would reshape Medicare for many
people into a voucher-like program.

He also attracted attention for wanting to keep tax breaks in place that were set to expire for the wealthy.

If he had won both races, Ryan would have had to resign from Congress and a special election would have been held to fill the House seat.

But that was not to in the stars. Romney ended up losing the election, as well as Ryan's home state, which Obama won with 52 per cent of the votes to Romney 47 per cent, walking away with 10 electoral votes.

Unlike his GOP counterpart, Vice President Biden, who had spent the past year tirelessly campaigning for Obama, likely helped him score a victory in his state of Delaware, where the commander-in-chief walked away with 59 per cent of the vote.

Despite Tuesday's major setback, Ryan's future appears to be nothing if not bright, and according to media reports, the Republican hot shot has been working on an exit strategy long before the election.

In a story leaked to Phillip Elliot of the Associated Press, Ryan's aides said that he will be just fine even in defeat.

'Professor Ryan? Lobbyist Ryan? Maybe back to plain-old Rep. Ryan or future President Ryan?' said the AP story's lead, implying that defeat is a foregone conclusion for the Romney/Ryan ticket.

Some political pundits have suggested that the 42-year-old congressman may be back on the campaign trail as early as 2016, this time as a presidential candidate.

One more round? the 69-year-old Biden, left, half-jokingly said that he might run for the White House again

History hasn't been kind to losing vice presidential candidates. Only two have gone on to become presidents themselves. The last two failed running mates were Sarah Palin and John Edwards - one went on to a reality television show, the other's personal life turned out to be fit for a soap opera.

But no one expects the GOP’s darling to have a similar fate, and he returns to Congress as a larger figure.

His re-entry into daily politics in Washington comes as Congress enters a furious period of negotiations over averting a ‘fiscal cliff’ - a series of expiring tax cuts and pending spending cuts that could push the United States back into recession if Congress cannot reach a deal by January 1.

Now, Ryan's status as House Budget committee chairman will be joined with a new political celebrity, giving the author of the Republicans' fiscal plans an even greater hand in directing the debate.

At the time of his selection by Romney, Ryan was a familiar figure to only 35 per cent of people, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Today, he is a household name.

High praise: In his victory speech, President Obama called Joe Biden 'the best vice president anyone could ever hope for'

Ryan's supporters say the campaign 
enhanced Ryan's stature. Speaking days before the election, 
Representative Sean Duffy recalled a warm reception from Democrats when 
Ryan returned to the chamber's floor this fall.

They say that the campaign reinforced
a reputation for truth-telling and open-mindedness, pointing to his 
speech on Medicare at a convention for the AARP, a lobbying group for 
older Americans which has backed Obama administration proposals, as a 
sign of his political courage.

Romney's loss is bound to provoke 
soul-searching among Republicans who lost a presidential election 
despite Obama's vulnerability amid a weak economy. In theory, Ryan is 
positioned like few other leaders to step into the void.

‘I've been referring to Paul Ryan as 
the Paul Revere of the next generation,’ Kasich said, referring to the 
American Revolutionary War hero who warned Colonial forces of impending 
threats from the British.

‘I'll tell you he's just getting started,’ he added.

If Ryan chooses to get into the fray 
in four years, he is likely to go head-to-head with the charismatic and 
outspoken New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on the Republican side.

On the Democratic side, the Wisconsin congressman may even encounter his old rival Joe Biden, 69, who has not ruled a run for the White House. 

After voting Tuesday morning in Delaware, the 69-year-old playfully responded to a reporter's question about whether he thought this would be the last time he voted for himself in an election.

‘No, I don't think so,’ Biden said with a grin, according to USA Today.

During an 11th-hour campaign stop in Cleveland later in the day, the vice president was asked by a voter whether he would make yet another run for the White House if Obama wins.

‘Oh, I'm going to go back home and run for county council or something,’ Biden responded.

Biden's first unsuccessful attempt to capture the presidency came in 1988, when he was forced to end his campaign after being accused of plagiarizing parts of a speech.

His brief 2008 run was most memorable for describing Obama as the 'first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.'

But on Wednesday morning, all that was left in the past as Obama opened his victory speech y praising his right-hand man as 'the best vice president anyone could ever hope for.'
