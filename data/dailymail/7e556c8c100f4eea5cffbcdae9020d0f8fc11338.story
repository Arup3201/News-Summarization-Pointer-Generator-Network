Matthew Dobson, 40, was high on drugs when he stole a car and crashed it through fence at airport

A car thief smashed through airport fencing and drove down a runway as a KLM passenger flight on its last drops of fuel came in to land.

Matthew Dobson, 40, was high on drugs when he stole the Renault Clio and and drove at 80mph towards Humberside Airport in Lincolnshire, where he used to work, a court heard.

He was jailed for three years and eight months at Grimsby Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to burglary, driving offences and a charge of recklessly endangering an aircraft.

The court heard that all flights taking off and landing at the airport on August 5 had be stopped, including a KLM passenger flight from Amsterdam, which can carry up to 85 passengers.

'It was put in a holding pattern and had seven minutes left to divert to a different airfield to ensure it had enough fuel left to land somewhere safely,' the CPS said in a statement.

He also drove underneath the path of a helicopter, which was carrying 11 passengers and was in the process of taking off.

Dobson sped the full length of the runway before driving off it and landing in a nearby field, where he was found lying in the grass trying to hide himself, according to the Grimsby Telegraph.

Airport emergency crew leader Lee Power and stationed firefighter, Stephen Huteson, approached Dobson who denied knowledge of the car and instead claimed he was a farmer.

The pair claimed that he appeared 'agitated and under the influence of intoxicant'.

Prosecutors said his 'bizarre' crime spree began when he stole the keys to the Renault Clio from a house in Grimsby and drove off, leaving the car's owner locked in her property.

The window cleaner then led police on a high-speed chase through peak-hour traffic towards Humberside Airport, where he crashed through mesh fencing and on to the runway.

A KLM passenger flight from Amsterdam, which can carry up to 85 passengers, was on its last drops of fuel as it attempted to land at the airport as the incident unfolded

Yorkshire and Humberside Crown advocate Jeremy Evan said: 'This bizarre crime spree was extraordinarily dangerous and reckless, putting many people's lives at risk.

'Matthew Dobson acted with utter impunity and demonstrated a complete and appalling lack of concern for his or anyone else's safety. 

'He took it upon himself to commit this series of offences and it was sheer fortune that no tragedy occurred that day.'

Defending, Ketya Saudek said Dobson had started taking amphetamines after his life 'spiralled out of control' following the breakdown of his marriage.

He had previously used the drug for five years to help ease pain after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia - an agonising condition.

Dobson, who used to work at Humberside Airport (pictured), crashed through the mesh security fencing and onto the runway before landing in a field. He tried to hide in grass and when approached said he was a farmer

He had been sectioned under the mental health act and had been released from hospital a week before the offence.

Miss Saudek told the court that Dobson had a window cleaning business, a mortgage, a marriage and children and not been a trouble to the law.

She said: 'He is extremely remorseful, he is extremely ashamed of himself, he feels he has let himself down, more particularly he has let his family down and his children down.'

Sentencing Dobson, Recorder Andrew Dallas said it was pure luck that no one was hurt.

He said: 'You caused considerable distress, considerable concern and well over £1,000 of damage.'
