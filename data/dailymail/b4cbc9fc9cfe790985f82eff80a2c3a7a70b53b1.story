A huge six alarm fire in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco broke out on Tuesday afternoon - sending a huge plume of smoke skywards visible across the city.

The raging inferno started at a nine story apartment at around 5 pm and led a wall of the structure to collapse about an hour later. More than 150 firefighters and 90 firetrucks were on the scene battling the blaze.

Flames shot 40-feet into the air as scaffolding collapsed amid the intense heat leading to the partial collapse of the huge construction project.

Lucky: There were no initial reports of injuries. The six-alarm fire that began about 5 p.m. was ravaging a high-rise building under construction on the San Francisco Bay waterfront

Huge: Fire-suppression systems had not yet been installed in the building, making the battle against the blaze more difficult, Fire Department spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said

At around 6.45 pm the top two floors of the building came crashing down ontop of each other as firefighters kept a safe distance on aerial ladder trucks.

Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White told the San Francisco Chronicle that the blaze had been contained and not spread to adjacent buildings or to the surrounding neighborhood.

'This is a great save right here,' said Hayes-White pointing to a building across the street.

'We were able to put up a water curtain. To be able to save this is huge.'

Dedication: Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White told The San Francisco Chronicle that firefighters had kept the blaze from spreading to nearby structures

Suppression: The burning building, owned by BRE Properties, was intended to be a residential one, KTVU-TV reported. It was being built by Suffolk Construction, according to the Chronicle

Decimated: The fire torched what was due to become a 360-unit apartment complex

As of 6:45 p.m., firefighters had contained 50 to 60 percent of the blaze, officials said. San Francisco Fire Department Chief Joanne Hayes-White said crews would let the building collapse upon itself

Hayes-White said that as the fire continues into the night the structure is 'likely to come down'.

'It will collapse. The more it burns, the more water we put on it, the more likely it is to fail,' said Hayes-White to the San Francisco Chronicle.

She also said that the cause of the fire was not known and that there were no reports of injuries.

Construction workers had been present at the site until 4pm - which meant that the reason for the fire had been left for more than an hour to fester and burn.

Safe distance: The five-alarm fire broke out just before 5 p.m. in the nine-story building on Fourth Street near China Basin Street, according to the Fire Department

Terrifying: Residents in the area near AT&T Park said they were being told they could not return to their homes

Staring: Residents watching said 'You can feel intense heat across the water. Flames now crumpling steel'.

When the fire started, 'it really took off,' the chief said. 'It went up really quickly.'

Hundreds of people lined up along China Basin to watch firefighters battle the flames at the construction site that was meant to be a 360 unit apartment complex.

The Mission Bay neighborhood is a onetime industrial area that lies along the San Francisco Bay. It is home to a University of California, San Francisco, medical campus and is close to AT&T; Park, the San Francisco Giants stadium.
