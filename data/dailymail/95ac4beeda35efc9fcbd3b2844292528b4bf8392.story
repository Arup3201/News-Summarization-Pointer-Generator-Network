Real Madrid were taken apart by Atletico Madrid at the Estadio Vicente Calderon with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale spectators as Diego Simone’s side ran riot in a 4-0 victory.

It is the first time in 64 years that Real have lost three straight games in the ground of their neighbours but this was different – this was embarrassing for the richest club in football, smothered from the first kick to last by their poor-relations city neighbours.

Real's £250m forward line of Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema mustered just one shot in a first half dominated by Atletico Madrid who scored twice through Tiago and Saul.

And in the second half the suffering continued when the brilliant Antoine Griezmann added a third and Mario Mandzukic made it four.

A shell-shocked Carlo Ancelotti said after the game. ‘They deserved to win because they won in every facet: they won the battle and they won the football match. We will have to change our attitude going forward.

‘We were second to everything; we lost all the aerial challenges, we weren’t in the game. None of our players played well. It’s the worst performance since I have been the manager.’

Simeone said: ‘The way the players carried out the plan was brilliant. We went about the job very seriously and now we need to keep going forward the same way.’ 

Asked if they were now title candidates he said: ‘We still take it one get at a time.’ And when it was put to him that it was one of his greatest games in charge of Atletico Madird he said: ‘No, it was just another a league game’. 

Atletico Madrid shot out of the blocks. In contrast Real Madrid were strolling and it wasn’t long before they were paying the price for that lack of intensity. Gabi’s Corner on 13 minutes was brought down by Mandzukic who laid it back to Tiago on the edge of the area.

The former Chelsea midfielder shot through a crowded penalty area and Iker Casillas fumbled the effort and allowed it to squirm over the line. ‘Iker Iker’ sung the Atletico Madrid supporters. They had been given a helping hand by Real’s keeper, not that they needed it.

Real Madrid were playing without three of their first-choice back four and it was showing with Fabio Coentrao struggling to deal with Arda Turan and Nacho and Raphael Varane not able to handle Mandzukic.

Perhaps their preoccupation with the Croat striker was the reason why they left Saul in so much space in the penalty area on 19 minutes. The young midfielder who was out on loan at Rayo Vallecano last season and interesting a host of Premier League clubs had only been on the pitch for nine minutes replacing the injured Koke.

Siqueira got away from Dani Carvajal, dribbled along the byline and pulled the ball back where Saul finished with an acrobatic scissor kick past a this-time faultless Casillas.

Carvajal had received no support from Bale who had more importantly been anonymous in attack down the Madrid right. Likewise Ronaldo was missing in action down the left. By half time Carlo Ancelotti had seen enough and put Ronaldo at centre forward bringing, on Jese at the expense of Sami Khedira but it made no real difference.

Real were fortunate to only be two goals down at half-time. Griezmann had scored what would have been a third only to be incorrectly flagged offside. And a Godin shot had hit Khedira on the face and then the hand leaving Atletico players demanding a penalty.

Real had managed just one shot in the first half and it was notable that no Real Madrid player said anything to a team-mate walking off the pitch – each one leaving the pitch with his head down. Perhaps they were saving it for the dressing room.

Real improved at the start of the second half and with Raul Garcia booked for dissent while warming up on the touchline and Turan also cautioned there was hope for Real, but it was false hope.

Griezmann continued to threaten after the break. First Casillas palmed away his shot, he then bicycle-kicked just over from Saul’s cross, and then headed Juanfran’s cross over. He was also involved in the build up to what should have been a brilliant third. Real were left dizzy from Atletico’s passing football down the right and when Juanfran crossed, Tiago sent his free-header into the arms of Casillas.

The third did come however and no one deserved it more than Griezmann.

This was now embarrassing for Real Madrid. They have been out-fought by Simeone's team before, but never out-played like this. The last time Atletico Madrid had beaten Real 3-0 at home in the league it was 1970. Ancelotti brougth on Hernandez for Benzema but everyone connected with Real Madrid just wanted the final whistle.

Atletico didn’t want it to end. Simeone was conducting the crowd and Fernando Torres was on for the brilliant Griezmann and looking for a goal of his own.

Real forced their first corner and Asier Illaramendi shot just over but Real were still sinking and the Estadio Vicente Calderon, who had greeted the two teams with a sea of red and white flags at the start, were now doing the ‘Mexican Wave’ as the clock ran down.

Torres never got his goal but he did set up Mandzukic to convert the fourth and complete the humiliating rout. Once again Simeone had masterminded an extraordinary victory.

Ronaldo said: ‘It’s a terrible day for us. We are very annoyed because everything was missing – desire, attitude. Real Madrid can’t lose 4-0 against any team in the world. But I am still convinced we will win the league.'
