Circle lenses, a type of colored contacts imported from Asia that make the wearer look as though they have enlarged eyes, are set to be one of the New Year’s biggest beauty trends, having first risen to popularity four years ago.

However, doctors have warned that the cosmetic lenses, which cover up the whites of the eyes in order to make the irises appear larger, can cause serious infection and even blindness. 

In 2010, F.D.A. spokeswoman Karen Riley told the New York Times that consumers 'risk significant eye injuries — even blindness' when they buy lenses without a valid prescription or assistance from an eyecare professional.

Think pink: Mari Santos, a writer for the beauty site xoVain, tried out circle lenses, a type of colored contacts imported from Asia that makes one's eyes appear larger

Eye opening: 'To me, pink lenses look natural yet eerie, subtle yet slightly unnerving, and basically all the things I aspire to be in life,' she said of the Pinky Paradise lenses, which cost $29

But it seems that the health risks involved with wearing the quirky contact lenses haven't stopped them from making a return to popularity. 

Earlier this week, Mari Santos, a writer for the beauty site xoVain, tried out a $29 pink set from the Malaysia-based online retailer Pinky Paradise, saying of the eerie-looking lenses: 'I love them'. 

'To me, pink lenses look natural yet eerie, subtle yet slightly unnerving, and basically all the things I aspire to be in life,' she added.

'I like that they give the eyes just that tiny glaze of pink, without being overwhelming.'

Pinky Paradise sells circle lenses in a wide array of nontraditional hues, including yellow, red, aqua and white, all in the $20-$30 range.

The site also offers freakier variations on the trend, such as 'angry cat-eye' and 'demon eye' lenses.

The look became popular in Japan, Singapore and South Korea before becoming a major trend with young American women in 2010 - inspired partly by Lady Gaga's digitally altered eyes in her Bad Romance video.

A video in which YouTube sensation Michelle Phan demonstrates how to get 'crazy, googly Lady Gaga eyes' with circle lenses has been viewed more than 48 million times.

Proceed with caution: Doctors have warned against wearing decorative contact lenses, which are illegal to sell in the United States without a prescription

However, Dr S. Barry Eiden, chairman of the contact lens and cornea section of the American Optometric Association, stated at the time that those selling circle lenses online 'are encouraging the avoidance of professional care'. He also advised that ill-fitting lenses could deprive the eye of oxygen and cause vision problems.

Pinky Paradise, which sells both prescription and non-prescription circle lenses, says on its website: 'Circle lenses are generally safe and are approved by Korean FDA. But precaution is always needed.'
