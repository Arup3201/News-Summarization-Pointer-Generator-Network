A New Jersey mother is trying to come to terms with the death of her two-year-old daughter after accidentally running down the child in a dark driveway on Saturday night.

Orialis Andion  was picking up her three children from their grandparents house in Vineland, Cumberland County, about 8.30pm when 'she ended up going forward instead of backward', hitting her little girl in the process.

Jaelise Rodriguez, who would have turned three in March, died from the injuries she sustained from the car.

'She didn't see the baby,' the aunt of Jaelise,  Edissell Rodriguez, told Press Of Atlantic City.

Edissell also said it is unclear why Jaelise was not in the car, since her mom had come to pick her up, along with two other children, from Jaelise’s grandparents’ house.

The house is on a quiet cul-de-sac at the end of the section of Venus Drive that crosses Swelin Drive off West Oak Road.

Jaelise’s grandfather, Ramon Rodriguez, was home when the accident happened but didn’t see how it unfolded.

'It’s hard to explain what we feel,' he said.

'Grandpas are an extension (of the parents).

'We love probably more.'

No charges have been filed.

An investigation is ongoing.

Family, friends and neighbors have started a vigil outside the house, leaving flowers, balloons, toys and candles to show their condolences.

Jaelise is the third Vineland child to die in accidents involving vehicles since October 30.

Alexa Strittmatter, 14, was hit by two cars while crossing Main Road to a bus stop.

Jermire Lowery, also 14, died in a crash near Almond and Mill Roads on November 11.

'(Jaelise) was a happy child who liked to dance,' said neighbor and family friend Cerise Evans.

'She was a happy baby in general.'

Shocking: Alexa Strittmater was walking to her bus stop with her brother and sister about 7am on October 30 in Vineland when she was struck by one vehicle traveling north on Main Road and then struck by another vehicle traveling south

Jermire Lowery, also 14, was killed on November 11 about 7.50pm when the Checy Malibu he was travelling in struck a truck along Almond Road near Mill Road

Edissell said Jaelise was well liked by other kids.

'Anywhere we went, she’d say hi to everyone,' Edissell said.

'Other kids loved her.'

Jaelise is succeeded by four-year-old brother, Julius, and eight-year-old stepbrother, Jay’qwan, Edissell said.

Aunt Edili Rodriguez brought pink and white flowers to the memorial as she prepared to help her brother with his grief.

'It’s not even close to over,' she said.
