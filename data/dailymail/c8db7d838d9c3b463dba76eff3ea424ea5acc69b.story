The older generation are often befuddled by modern technology.

And the elderly father of New Jersey resident Drew Kanevsky is no exception. 

After receiving a miniature personal drone complete with flashing lights for Christmas, the pensioner decided to test out what it could do.

This comical video shows the moment he accidentally launched the device into his own face.

Fortunately, the old man escaped without injury, and his family can be heard loudly laughing about the incident.
