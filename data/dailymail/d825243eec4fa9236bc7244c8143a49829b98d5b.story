Two girls who were driving along a quiet suburban street were stunned to see a  man running naked - in broad daylight.

The footage, filmed by one of the girls on her phone, shows the streaker jogging barefoot in Brisbane on what is believed to be a recent Sunday morning.

The man appeared alone when the two girls spotted him as they drove  along a street in their car.

Two girls filmed the bizarre moment of a completely nude streaker jogging barefoot along a quiet street

The man was seen running around the corner and swinging what appears to be his underwear in the air in his right hand after he noticed them screaming and laughing hysterically at him.

'Oh follow him!' a woman's voice is heard screaming as she laughs in the background.

As they turn the corner, he stops in front of a silver parked car and quickly turns around to present himself, full frontal, before sprinting up the sloped road.

'What is he doing? Oh my god!' one girl says in surprise. 

The footage, believed to be filmed on a mobile phone, was posted onto YouTube by user Kellie Nealon on Sunday.

The caption with the video explained: 'Random guy streaking on Lytton Road Brisbane one random Sunday morning.'

The naked man from Brisbane wasn't the only one who had his streaking moment. 

On Sunday, a streaker ran onto the field during the One Day International cricket series between Australia and South Africa.

But the naked run ended abruptly when security guards quickly tackled him to the ground in the 29th over after Shane Watson reached his half-century.

He is now banned from the Sydney Cricket Ground for 12 months and will face a hefty $5,500 fine.
