A senior White House reporter's Twitter account has attracted thousands of followers after she posted controversial photos from President Obama's trip to Saudi Arabia.

Carrie Budoff Brown, who writes for Politico, transfixed thousands of Saudis who are starved of news covered of their own royal family and government because of strict censorship rules.

However, since the Arab Spring, use of Twitter and other social networks has grown exponentially in the region, making it the fasted growing market in the world.

When Brown began posting pictures of 89-year-old King Abdullah, whose health is unknown to his people, with an oxygen tube beneath his nose, her followers jumped from 3,500 to more than 16,000 in just 24 hours. As of Monday morning, she had 17,000 followers.

Ms Brown, who writes for Politico, gained thousands more followers on Twitter as she posted pictures of Obama's meeting with King Abdullah in a country that is severely restricted on the information it gets about the royal family

President Obama with Saudi King Abdullah at Rawdat Khuraim, Saudi Arabia, on Friday. Politico reporter Carrie Budoff Brown caused a stir after she tweeted scores of photos from within the compound, revealing to news-starved Saudis the health of the King. This image was not taken by Brown

Brown wrote a first-person account for Politico explaining the incredible response to her pictures on Sunday night.

Most of Brown's photos were taken at King Abdullah's desert retreat.

She
 said she was amazed at how her 'stream of mediocre iPhone photos... 
managed to captivate, anger and surprise the country's vast Twitter 
community.'

Her Twitter feed became
 the subject of a Al-Arabiya piece on Saturday and local newspapers 
picked up her photos.

Twitter users bombarded her with tweets requesting
 more images in the country where the government has jailed, intimated 
and harassed people for using the social network to criticize authority.

Brown admits she didn't fully realize 
any of this when Marine One and a helicopter carrying a pool of White 
House reporters and photographers swept across the desert towards 
Abdullah's outpost for his meeting with Obama.

She started snapping as they flew from 
the airport in Riyadh over desert, seeing nothing but dry terrain and 
the odd camel.

But then they came across lush green grass and trees, and
 a compound of lavish buildings and tents that reminded her of Las Vegas
 for their contrast to the sand.

After landing, security guards attempted
 to block the US press from getting to the entrance of the building as 
Obama walked in, but White House staffers repeatedly yelled that this 
wasn't what was agreed and that the media would not be shut out.

When they piled through, Brown said what they saw was 'straight out of a movie set'.

Twitter: Brown wrote a first-person account for Politico explaining the incredible response to her tweets

'Tall bowls with wrapped chocolates 
stacked in precise rows. Fresh flowers on every coffee table. A massive 
gold clock the size of an armoire. Satin upholstery, crystal 
chandeliers, oriental rugs and luxurious couches with perfectly place 
pillows. Photos of the king hung on the walls,' she said.

Brown took pictures of it all, tweeting them immediately.

For
 their meeting, the two leaders sat in armchairs at the far side of a 
back room looking out onto artificial greenery, and talked quietly.

The media was ushered out after about 30
 seconds, into an ornate dining room with an elaborate buffet covered 
with hummus, salmon and pastries.

But Brown had already created a stir.

She opened up Twitter and saw she'd gained 2,000 followers since landing at the airport an hour before.

Brown said she was bombarded by Saudis asking for more photos, more information on the king's health, and more insight on the seldom-seen royal family and government after her tweets

Within five hours, she said she had 
gained 7,000 new followers and by Sunday night she had more than 16,700 
people lapping up her tweets.

She said she was bombarded by Saudis asking for more photos, more information on the kingâ€™s health, and more insight on the seldom-seen royal family.

'Thanks 2 the pics u posted 4 the retreat, that 4 long have been hidden from Saudis!' @Abdul_IA wrote. 'They followed u looking 4 more.'

Another, @QaTaRaT_, wrote: '@cbudoffbrown actually Saudi media is not allowed to declare the king condition. But once Carrie arrive, all people know what happening. Thanks.'

Others were critical, suggesting she was invading the King's privacy. But she said while she wasn't a Twitter user before, and she'll probably go back to her seldom posts, her feed will never be the same.
