John Howard is a more contentious topic than fascism, 9/11, and the theory of evolution.

At least, that's what's suggested by the results of a new study ranking the most heavily edited pages on Wikipedia.

WikiWar Monitor, made up of researchers from Oxford, Rutgers and the Central European University, totalled the most re-edits to pages in a cache of 4.7 million to find the 100 most polarising English language pages. 

Former Australian Prime Minister Mr Howard ranked 44 on the list, above a number of widely controversial figures such as round-earth advocate Nicolaus Copernicus

Mr Howard's page ranked as a more controversial topic than human evolution

The former Australian Prime Minister Mr Howard ranked 44 on the list, above a number of widely controversial figures such as round-earth advocate Nicolaus Copernicus.

The 25th Prime Minister of Australia also proved more controversial than topics such as Evolution (49), Fascism (62), Afghanistan (63) and 9/11 (84).

The authors used a systematic approach to ranking the articles: 'we define a controversy measure M, which quantifies size and intensity of the edit warring taking place at a certain time and on a certain article,' the study authors wrote.

'Our results indicate that Wikipedia is more than just an encyclopaedia; it is also a window into convergent and divergent social-spatial priorities, interests and preferences.'

The 25th Prime Minister of Australia also proved more controversial than topics such Fascism (62), and 9/11 (84). The researchers said Wikipedia is a window into 'social-spatial priorities, interests and preferences'

The list also divided the most provocative topics based on language, with Mr Howard's friend George W Bush topping the list for the English Language.

Ironically, the bottom of the list, 100, was the 'truth.'
