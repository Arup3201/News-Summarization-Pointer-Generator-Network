Meet the Sydney artist having a crack at our politicians.

Jenna Bloom has been busy painting the faces of Australia's  leaders for her new satirical exhibition Pollie Cracker.

The stencil artist has drawn inspiration from comments and  opinions  by politicians that have made waves on social media for being controversial.

'Everyone has strong opinions and I started to notice that quite a bit on social media,' Ms Bloom told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm quite a sarcastic person and I thought the exhibition would be a good way to the information people are putting out there into imagery.'

And no politician is safe from Ms Bloom's can of spray paint.

Among those who have made the satirical cut including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Treaurer Joe Hockey, Clive Palmer, Education Minister Christopher Pyne, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

This cardboard painting of Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a homeless man is one of Ms Bloom's favourites due to its social context

'I mainly focused on them because they're the ones in the media spotlight at the moment. Some of their statements, for whatever reason, have been quite controversial,' Ms Bloom said. 

Scott Morrison's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the Immigration Minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to Australia via boat. 

Education Minister Christopher Pyne is featured sitting on a chair in the 'naughty corner' and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was painted with her head in the sand due to her stance on climate change.

Former Prime Ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, who infamously toppled each other from Labor's leadership have been painted on tombstones

'But the Tony Abbott piece with him as a homeless person is my favourite. I live in Kings Cross and regularly see people begging for money to survive. I always feel an immense amount of empathy for them and I was trying to depict if there was any empathy in politics?'

Ms Bloom said she wasn't trying to push an agenda with her artwork, just prompt discussion.

'I just want people to get a laugh out of it and then make up their own minds,' she said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been painted with 'her head in the sand' for her position on climate change

This artwork by Ms Bloom earned her a finalist spot in the Stencil Art Prize 2014

US President Barack Obama will make a brief appearance in Ms Bloom's exhibition as the only international politician. Mr Abbott reportedly gifted him a surfboard

'I really do think people will see the humorous side. You make a joke, but not everyone is going to laugh.' 

Pollie Cracker will feature at Black Penny’s Blacklisted Gallery, 648 Bourke Street, Surry Hills, from October 28 to November 3.
