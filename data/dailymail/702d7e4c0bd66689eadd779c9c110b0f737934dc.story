For generations men have been brought up to be the perfect gentleman, opening doors for women and walking closer to the kerb to protect companions from the traffic.

But the act of being chivalrous could have a detrimental impact on a person's health, as scientists have found air pollution can be up to a third higher at the kerb than on the inside of the pavement.

A new study has recommended that people avoid busy streets and junctions altogether to protect their health - and even advised to stay away from the edge of the road to keep out pollution.

A new study has found you are more likely to suffer the effects of air pollution if you walk closer to the kerb, rather than if you take a path further from the traffic

Atmospheric consultant Dr Iarla Kilbane-Dawe, who led the study aimed at educating members of the public on the dangers of air pollution, said drivers should close their air vents while in busy traffic to prevent a person inhaling harmful fumes, the Evening Standard reported.

She also mentioned previous studies which identified the health benefits of avoiding the kerb, carried out by three scientists at Imperial College London around 2004.

He said: 'Walking or cycling along quiet rather than busy roads can reduce your exposure by half or even more, especially if you avoid pollution hotspots at the busiest junctions.

'Even walking further from the kerb on a busy road has been shown to make a difference.'

One study recently found that nearly 3,000 Londoners die prematurely each year from the harmful health effects of inhaling polluted air.

Further studies by Dr Kilbane-Dawe showed that in parts of the capital exposure to particulate pollution - a harmful mix of brake dust, soot and tyre fragments - is the fifth biggest killer after cancer and heart disease.

And in Kensington and Chelsea, as well as places including Bromley and Richmond, death rates relating to pollution were twice as high as death rates from traffic accidents.

It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) named and shamed British towns and cities for breaching safety levels for air pollution.

Nine urban areas - London, Birmingham, Chesterfield, Leeds, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent and Thurrock - were highlighted by the global health body.

WHO said that across the world most cities that measure outdoor air pollution are failing to meet its guidance for safe levels and are putting residents at risk of respiratory disease and other health problems.

The research carried out by government advisor, Dr Iarla Kilbane-Dawe found air pollution can be up to a third higher at the kerb than on the inside of the pavement

Overall, only 12 per cent of the people living in cities reporting on air quality reside in places which comply with WHO's safety levels.

A spokesman said that it appears that air pollution is 'getting worse'.

WHO's air quality database monitors 1,600 regions around the world, including 36 in Britain.

Earlier this year it estimated that outdoor air pollution was responsible for the deaths of 3.7 million people globally during 2012.

Air pollution is associated with deaths from heart disease and stroke, as well as respiratory illnesses and cancers, a spokesman said.

One way to measure air quality is to asses the levels of a type of pollution known as particulate matter (PMs).

'Too many urban centres today are so enveloped in dirty air that their skylines are invisible,' said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO's assistant director-general for family, children and women's health.

'Not surprisingly, this air is dangerous to breathe. So a growing number of cities and communities worldwide are striving to better meet the needs of their residents - in particular children and the elderly.'

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated earlier this year that outdoor air pollution was responsible for the deaths of 3.7 million people globally during 2012

Dr Carlos Dora, coordinator for interventions for healthy environments at WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health, added: 'We cannot buy clean air in a bottle, but cities can adopt measures that will clean the air and save the lives of their people.'

Recently English health officials called on local authorities to do more to protect people from harmful air pollution.

Long-term exposure to air pollution led to around 25,000 deaths in England in 2010, Public Health England (PHE) said.

PHE said that air quality has improved 'considerably' in the UK in recent decades due to new, cleaner technology and tighter environmental legislation.

But it said that local action can be taken to reduce the emissions of these man-made particles and people's exposure to air pollution.
