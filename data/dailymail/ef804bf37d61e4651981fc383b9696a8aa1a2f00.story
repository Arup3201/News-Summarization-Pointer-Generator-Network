Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has defended Mario Balotelli's half-time shirt swap with Real Madrid defender Pepe, claiming the Reds striker did not mean any offence.

As the two sides entered the tunnel at half-time in their Champions League game at Anfield on Wednesday night, Balotelli was caught swapping shirts with the centre-back, and was substituted before the two teams re-emerged for the second half.

Speaking in his Daily Mirror column, Dalglish said: 'He didn't mean any disrespect. Some people seem to have interpreted him swapping shirts as a gesture of defiance towards the club because he was going to be substituted. That's absurd.'

Dalglish cited Balotelli's stint away from England as a potential reason for the misunderstanding. Shirt swapping at half-time, according to the former Liverpool manager, is common on the continent.

'The culture has changed now, particularly abroad. Players like to swap shirts. It's not unusual for them to do it at half-time. I don't really see the problem with it.

'Swapping shirts at half-time is not part of English football's culture but my guess is Mario Balotelli didn't know that. Pepe asked him to swap shirts anyway. It wasn't as if Mario initiated it.'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is expected to start the controversial Italian against Hull City on Saturday afternoon, despite chastising his player in the aftermath of the incident.

Dalglish believes that it is the right decision to give Balotelli another chance, despite yet another lacklustre performance in the Reds' 0-3 loss to Real Madrid. 

'Brendan Rodgers has got it right. It's not a big deal, and my guess is Balotelli won't do it again.'
