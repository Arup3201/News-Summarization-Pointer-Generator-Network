A Los Angeles toddler who developed huge life-threatening tumors pressing against his neck and chest while in the womb is now living life as a regular child after undergoing a rare and extremely risky delivery procedure.

Second-time mom Britnie Sanchez was 34 weeks pregnant when she was told her son - who her and husband Chris named Blake - had masses on his tiny body that were 'like airplane pillows but cut in half and then under his arm'.

While the tumors were likely blocking Blake's airway passages, he remained protected in utero because his blood was oxygenated through the umbilical cord.

But, once delivered, doctors did not believe Blake would be capable of breathing on his own.

Success: Little Blake Sanchez underwent a life-saving surgery seconds after being born with his umbilical cord still attached to remove tumors on his neck and chest, which would have prevented him breathing

To save Blake, doctors performed a rare and risky surgery during the delivery called the EXIT procedure, which involves operating on the infant when they are out of the uterus but before the umbilical cord has been clamped

Happy mom: Britnie Sanchez was not able to hold her son Blake until he was two-months-old

'I couldn't stop crying,' Sanchez told ABC News of receiving the news.

'I would just sit in our nursery and cry. (But) I knew when he was in me, he was safe.'

In order to save Blake, doctors prepared to perform a unique surgery known as the EXIT procedure, standing for Ex-Utero Intrapartum Treatment, whereby the infant is operated on as soon as they are out of the uterus but before the umbilical cord has been clamped.

Dr. Esther Friedrich, a perinatologist at the Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center who treated Sanchez, said there were serious risks involved in the surgery.

'When you look at the literature in every single case, the mortality is high,' said Dr. Friedrich.

More than 40 medical personnel used two operating rooms to practice the procedure.

Sanchez said she spent the weeks leading up to the surgery in 'depressed mode', but calmed down after talking to Dr. Frederich.

'You're going to wake up to beautiful baby boy,' Sanchez recalled Dr. Frederich telling her as she entered the operating room.

'Don't be sad, this is a not a day to be sad. This is a day to be happy.'

Despite the tracheotomy tube and ventilator, Blake continued to grow and develop happy and healthily, his parents said

Then, just nine days before his first birthday, Blake ripped out his tube one night and, surprisingly, was able to breath on his own perfectly fine

Once Sanchez was under anesthesia, doctors had to figure out how to keep her body from naturally going into delivery, which could compromise Blake's health if doctors had not established an airway in time.

To trick her body, doctors flushed warm saline in Sanchez's uterus.

Frederich said doctors partially delivered Blake, gave him a sedative and then intubated him to establish an airway in about 15 minutes.

They then delivered Blake and cut the umbilical cord normally before whisking him to the neonatal intensive care unit.

'All I remember [after the surgery] is seeing my husband and asking if my baby was here,' Sanchez said.

'[He said] he's here and he's beautiful and he's doing great.'

Although doctors were able to establish an airway, Blake wasn't given the all-clear.

The large tumors were not cancerous, but they were filled with fluid that could not be easily drained and were pressing on his lungs.

It took nearly three months before doctors were able to try an experimental medication that could diminish the tumors.

Sanchez and her husband weren't able to hold their son until he was two months old.

For his first birthday, Blake Sanchez got to go home with mom Britnie and dad Chris without being attached to a ventilator for the first time in his life

Blake Sanchez now looks like any other toddler, save for a small amount of excess skin at the bottom of his face and top of his neck

At three months, the Sanchez family were finally able to take Blake home, although the infant had a tracheotomy tube that required he be on a ventilator at all times.

Then nine days before his first birthday, Blake pulled out his tracheotomy tube in the middle of the night, potentially leaving him unable to breathe.

Sanchez said she almost panicked and called 911, but resisted because Blake appeared to be fine.

After ending up back at the Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, doctors decided not to put the tracheotomy back in since the tracheotomy hole had nearly closed and Blake was breathing fine on his own.

For his first birthday, Blake got to go home without being attached to a ventilator for the first time in his life.

'This kid goes to the beat of his own drum,' Sanchez said.

All smiles: In a few months Blake will turn two, having come a long way from his initial prognosis

'He's a little miracle and we [couldn't] believe that for his first birthday he's running around talking.'

Earlier this month, the Sanchez family reunited with some of the doctors and nurses that helped deliver and treat Blake as a newborn.

Dr. Frederich said that seeing Blake recovery was remarkable knowing how extensive his tumors were at birth.

'You totally wouldn't be able to tell if you saw him,' she said.

'Seeing him grow through that whole procedure and treatment afterwards ... It's awesome. It really exemplifies why we're doing this.'
