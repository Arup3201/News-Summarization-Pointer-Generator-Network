'That led to nearby shopkeepers and other residents rushing to the scene.

'They soon encircled the attackers and fought them off.

'The clashes resulted in the death of two of the attackers, while one has been arrested.'

This violent attack comes amid a crackdown on violence in the Xinjiang region following a string of  attacks on innocent civilians.

Many of these attacks have been blamed on extremists attempting to overthrow the government.

Police have arrested and tried scores of suspects spreading extremist propaganda and owning prohibited weapons in recent weeks, reports suggest.

Chess halls are popular meeting places in
 mainland China - with customers spending hours playing mahjong, chess 
and cards at the venues.
