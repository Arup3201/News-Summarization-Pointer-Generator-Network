Mary Berry simply loves receiving fan mail. And her favourite type?

'Well,' she tells FEMAIL 'We get an awful lot of photographs sent to us every day proving that baking is not a girly thing anymore.

'And men aren't just making bread - I receive lots of photos of great big men standing in little aprons, proudly holding up their plates of brandy snaps. They're terribly funny and very lovely!'

'Christmas is all about having your family here - I'll be cooking for 14 this year, and it's all down to good preparation'

The cookery writer and star of the Great British Bake Off is delighted that the BBC Two television baking reality competition she judges with Paul Hollywood (alongside presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins) has brought baking back into the mainstream - and that everyone has been encouraged to have a go.

'Men, children...everyone is baking,' says Berry. 'It''s a wonderful activity that costs very little and is very rewarding. It teaches young people to add up, measure, use precision. It's a terrific educational tool. I can't wait for the next series.'

'I love an apple cake over Christmas because I think people get a bit fed up with mince pies, and I often do a game casserole' - i often do a game casserole'

Even Mary's own grandchildren are getting involved, especially the very little ones....

'All five of them love baking, so I do it with all of them - I make jelly with the two-year-old.

'The difference between baking with them and baking with their parents is that I have more time now with my grandchildren so I can plan. The secret to good baking is all in the planning.'

And what about the secret to dealing with fussy children who don't want to eat certain foods? Does Mary have one of those?

'You need to be crafty. Some children are so pernickety that you need to learn to be quite crafty and incorporate vegetables into soup or pastries.

'And don't panic about it. My lot weren't fuss, but that's because they knew I'd take no notice if they had been.'

But before Mary embarks on the fourth 
series of Bake Off next year (and an upcoming but untitled series about 
her life), there's Christmas to contend with - and this year she'll be 
cooking for the whole family of 14.

'Everyone's coming which will be 
wonderful - Christmas is all about having family here - and I'm cooking. But I'm not worried - it's all about careful
planning. And I think I know how to cope if there's a disaster.

'I'm quite traditional at Christmas 
so I'll do a turkey, but I might also make a game casserole. And then 
something chocolatey - always a great favourite with everyone - and an 
apple cake. I love an apple cake at Christmas. And because I think 
people are fed up with ordinary mince pies I'll be making mine in big 
Yorkshire pudding trays.'

'Getting fussy children to eat vegetables is all about being a little bit crafty,' says Mary Berry

Mary will also be cooking at the Taste Of Chirstmas exhibition at London's ExCel this weekend, demonstrating a number of recipes for the holiday season, including Rocky Road two ways, 'one for children, with marshmallows in, and one for adults, with ginger and sultanas'.

We'll be trying both.

Mary Berry will be at Taste of Christmas in partnership with Electrolux at Londonâ€™s ExCeL from 7th-9th December. Visit www.tasteofchristmas.com for tickets.
