President Barack Obama is preparing the crack the whip at Republicans in Congress, telling a gathering of Democratic lawmakers in Baltimore that 'I'm going to play offense' during his final years in office.

With the GOP in control of both the House and Senate, the president could easily become a lame duck with little impact. But he now seems intent on not letting grass grow beneath his feet.

In a closed-door session with Senate Democrats, he insisted that he won't go out quietly but will stand tough against his adversaries who are gearing up to cancel his ambitious immigration agenda – which they say is an unconstitutional power-grab – and to push a host of other legislation down his throat.

He's not planning to swallow it: 'I'm not going to spend the next two years on defense; I'm going to play offense,' Obama said, according to two meeting attendees who spoke to Politico.

An aide to a conservative Republican senator fired back on Friday, telling DailyMail.com that if Obama wants a fight he's come to the right place.

'These last two years are going to go down as a collection of historic moments when we stood up to a bully and he blinked,' the staffer said. 'Just you wait.'

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly.

'We're going to pass Keystone,' he said, referring to the controversial Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline. 'Then we're going to hammer Iran with new sanctions. We might even block him from closing Guantanamo.'

'At the end of the day, if the president wants to veto those and a half-dozen other things, he's welcome to go down in history as the worst president since Herbert Hoover.' 

Those half-dozen other things will likely include changes to a key section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul in a way that would help banks.

Obama has been loathe to uncap his veto pen, but the White House has threatened to do it on five separate measures since Congress convened last week.

The Iran legislation could prove politically costly for Obama to obstruct. It's being drafted by Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Democrat Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and will include tough new economic penalties against the Islamic state.

The White House is concerned that provoking Tehran could upend delicate negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions, and jeopardize the lives of four Americans being held there. 

The latest of several deadlines for the nuclear deal to be inked is June 30. 

FIRST SHOWDOWN: Republicans think they could collect enough votes in the Senate to override a presidential veto of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project, which protesters on the left vehemently oppose

Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told an audience in Louisville, Kentucky this week that 'we in the administration believe that, at this time, increasing sanctions would dramatically undermine our efforts to reach this shared goal' – referring to the aim of trimming back Iran's nuclear capabilities.

These measures, and another changing the definition of a full-time work week under the Obamacare law from 30 hours to 40, have enough support in both houses of Congress to pass, but likely lack the more robust supermajorities needed to override a veto from the president.

The Keystone XL pipeline is thought to have the greatest potential to reach that critical mass, however, which is why Republicans have teed it up first.

Former Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, pushed hard for it in October and November as a way to curry favor and avoid electoral defeat in her energy-economy-rich state. That led several Democrats to side with her, declaring their allegiance to the project.

'When Landrieu pushed for Keystone, the game changed,' the Senate aide said Friday. 'Now it's easy to reach 60 votes in the Senate, so there's going to be a floor vote.'

'We're maybe three votes away from having enough to squash a veto. If that happens, it's going to be the mother of all brushback pitches and make Obama think twice about vetoing the next one. And the next. And the one after that.'

GOP plans to deliver a series of bills to the White House, starting with the Keystone XL pipeline and hoping to override an Obama veto

They're 'three votes away' in the Senate from being able to override that veto, a move that a Senate aide called 'the mother of all brushback pitches'

@highlight

Obama is prepared to go down swinging and told a gathering of Senate Democrats that he's not going to stay on defense for the last two years

The Senate aide said vetoing Republicans' entire agenda would make Obama go down in history as 'the worst president since Herbert Hoover'
