Banking giant RBS could leave Scotland if Alex Salmond succeeds with his bid to break up Britain, its chairman warned last night. 

Sir Philip Hampton confirmed the bank would move elsewhere if separation brought ‘extra difficulties’ or cost pressures.

In a chilling warning, he said that ‘small countries don’t often have big banks’.

The loss of one of the country’s biggest 
companies would be an economic disaster, costing 14,000 jobs. If it did 
quit Scotland, its mostly likely new home would be London, the financial
capital of Europe.

Could RBS walk out of Scotland? Its chairman has warned that such a scenario is not out of the question

As well as those based at RBS, it could also force the collapse of Scottish firms that supply the Edinburgh-based banking giant and are reliant on its business.

The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which includes NatWest, has 26million customers in the UK.

Opponents said the comments put more pressure on the SNP to lay out the implications of independence for individuals and businesses.

During an appearance in the House of Lords, Sir Philip said the company had no current plans to move out of Scotland, but admitted that the position could change after any referendum that led to the end of the Union.

Despite its headquarters being in Scotland, Sir Philip pointed out that only 3-4  per cent of the RBS group’s customers are in Scotland. He said that, should difficulties arise, it would have to reconsider its 300-year connection with the country.

He also called for more clarity on what would happen if Scotland becomes independent.

Alex Salmond hit out at the UK Government today, claiming the 'complacency' of Chancellor George Osborne was the 'biggest danger to the economy'.

He accused the Westminster Government of 'basking in the Olympics afterglow' while it was 'still clear that what is needed is a direct capital investment stimulus to boost the economy'.

Mr Osborne will deliver his autumn statement next month and Mr Salmond said the rising jobless figures meant it was 'ever more critical' for him to 'take meaningful action to bring jobs and growth to the UK economy'.

Mr Salmond said: 'The biggest danger to the economy is the complacency of George Osborne.

'He should remember that the positive effect of the Olympics on employment will only last a few months whilst the impact of the decisions he makes in this forthcoming autumn statement will last for years.'

Mr Salmond said the number of people out of work and claiming benefits was 'unchanged' across the UK over the last year.

He added: 'It is time the Chancellor faced the reality that as a result of his decisions the UK's economy is flat-lining.

'It would be a tragedy for Scotland, and for the UK as a whole, if the positive impact of the Olympics is used to justify continued inaction by the UK Government.

'An extra £5billion in capital investment across the UK would allow us to provide an additional stimulus of more than £400million to support employment in Scotland now.'

Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said it was a 'cause for obvious concern that the latest Scottish figures show another increase in unemployment while it is falling in the rest of the UK'.

Sir Philip was giving evidence to the Economic Affairs Committee, as part of its inquiry into the impact of Scottish independence.

He told peers: ‘The overriding requirement is to serve our customers and to produce the best value we can for shareholders.

'We have no intention or plan to relocate from Scotland.’

Sir Philip said that even during the financial crisis the bank was ‘happy to be domiciled in Edinburgh’, but warned: ‘If, as a result of independence, we found extra difficulties or cost pressures or whatever arising from that, then we would have to think about alternatives.’

The UK Government, which owns 82 per cent of RBS, is almost certain still to have a large shareholding when the referendum takes place in 2014.

That means that, if Scots vote Yes, it would then be owned by a foreign government.

Under the SNP’s current  economic vision, an  independent Scotland would remain within a ‘sterling zone’ where the Bank of England would continue to be its ‘lender of last resort’.

Sir Philip admitted international money markets would be concerned about the issue, but pointed out that RBS received support during the banking crisis from foreign governments, including $90million from the US Federal Reserve.

SNP claims that independence would significantly boost growth were dismissed by a senior RBS executive.

Giving evidence, head of group economic affairs Stephen Boyle said independence or staying in the Union would make  little difference and would be ‘economically neutral’.

A spokesman for the pro-Union Better Together campaign said: ‘This is exactly why Alex Salmond needs to present exactly how independence will work.

'We can’t wait until November next year for his much-heralded White Paper to give the detail that individuals and businesses need.’

During a recent speech, former Chancellor Alistair  Darling accused Mr Salmond of ‘cooking the books’ on his arguments for separation.

He also said that separating from the rest of the UK could force some of Scotland’s financial giants to move out of the country.

Mr Darling said: ‘Uncertainty will 
damage business. Sooner or later, a Scottish firm with 90 per cent of 
its business somewhere else is going to ask itself:  Is staying worth 
the cost?’

A spokesman for
Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘Sir Philip made it absolutely 
clear RBS’ home is in Scotland and will remain so.

'There
is no evidence to suggest an independent Scotland will offer anything 
other than positive opportunities for all businesses, including the 
banking sector.’
