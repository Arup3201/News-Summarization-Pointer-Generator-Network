It is a great example of a filmmaker getting a little too close to his subject.

Nature photographer Brad Josephs placed his video camera on the banks of a river in the Alaska peninsula to capture the creature's movements.

Instead, he was stunned to find the animal tried to eat his camera - which thankfully survived with this amazing footage intact.

The clip includes amazingly close shots of the grizzly's teeth and tongue, as the animal tries to eat the camera but ultimately decided the item wasn't too pleasurable on the palate. 

It was released today by camera maker GoPro to show just how resilient their cameras are.

The filmmaker explained on his blog how he had fastened the camera to a rock with a rubber band in order to capture a mother bear with her baby, for footage to include in the Great Bear Stakeout for BBC.

The mother bear first approached the camera and nudged it a bit with her mouth.

But the baby bear ferociously attacked the unknown item.

Amazingly the camera, GoPro, wasn't damaged in the ordeal.

'Obviously the card was fine, and I actually used the camera many more times,' Josephs said.

'The bear only gently mouthed the camera, and didn’t even put a dent in it!

The camera manufacturer seemed pleased with themselves as the report that the gear stood the

true test in nature.

'It looks like we can check the "passed" box for the Grizzly bear test,' the company wrote in a comment on the filmmaker's YouTube channel.

The filmmaker uploaded the footage to the video site on Tuesday and it already has amassed nearly 16,000 views.
