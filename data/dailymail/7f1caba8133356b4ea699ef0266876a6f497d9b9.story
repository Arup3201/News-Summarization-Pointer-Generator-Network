It seemed that life couldn't get any better for Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen.

The Midwestern couple, 22 and 26, was just a few weeks away from their wedding as they wrapped up a summer of leading Christian youth in outdoors trips near the Sierra foothills outside of Sacramento.

Out in nature, hiking and rock-climbing, they were happy.

'I've just spent two awesome days with my fiancee Lindsay,' wrote Allen, 26, in a visitor log at a wooden hutch near the coastal hamlet of Jenner Beach, California. 'Can life ever be so perfect?'

The two were on an impromptu getaway from camp when Allen wrote that note. Later that night, they had trouble finding a place to stay, so they packed their camping gear and headed to a deserted beach, where they fell asleep for the night.

It was Aug. 15, 2004. They never woke up.

MURDERED: Lindsay Cutshall, 22, and Jason Allen, 26, were camp counselors when they were killed 10 years ago. They were to be married weeks after they were shot while camping at an abandoned beach in California

The two would be found three days later, still inside their sleeping bags, shot in the head at close range by a .45-caliber Marlin rifle.

'There's not a day that goes by that she hasn't come into my mind and my heart and oftentimes my prayers,' Cutshall's father, Chris, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

'And yes, there are still times that I shake my head a little bit. It was all so surreal.'

It has been 10 years since the senseless tragedy, and the families continue to seek answers about the double murder.

'Did they run into somebody who doesn't like Christians? They freely talked about their love for the Lord,' Allen's dad, Bob, told the Chronicle.

'Or was there someone down on the beach who was planning something illegal and they just happened to wander upon it? I don't know. Lots of things it could be.'

Detectives at the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office say the investigation remains very much active.

'There have been several times in the investigation where our adrenaline got going and we thought we had something good,' Lt. Carlos Basurto told the Chronicle. 'It turned out it wasn't as good as we thought.'

One of those times came a few years back, when investigators thought that fugitive Joseph Burgess, who was a suspect of killing two campers in Canada, could have something to do with the Jenner Beach killing.

But then he died in a 2009 shootout in New Mexico, and DNA evidence later exonerated him from the crime.

There was also drifter from Wisconsin, who was a prime suspect right after the bodies were found. He, too, was ruled out shortly afterward.

'I think about this case all the time,' Basurto told the Chronicle. 'My wife still talks to me about this case. She'll ask, 'Hey, what's going on in Jenner? Did you ever think of this?''

'Not to say you don't want to do that for the rest of the cases,' he added. 'But in 
this case, if ever there was an innocent victim, here you have them.'

Friends and family of the couple last week traveled from all over the country to visit the spot where Lindsay and Jason lost their lives.

A bouquet of flowers was placed at the spot where they camped.

'More than anything I just really miss them," Kathy Cutshall told the Chronicle.

'There's this homesickness that's deep in your heart and doesn't go away. We fall out of our chair crying sometimes â€” every holiday, every birthday. On my way home from work I just heard a song and I started crying.'
