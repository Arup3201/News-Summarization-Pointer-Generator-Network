A great white shark with razor-sharp teeth continues to close in on Britain, tracking technology can reveal.

The deadly predator – named Lydia – is just 780 miles (1,255km) off the coast of Cornwall and Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean.

The 14.5ft (4.5metres), 2,000lb (907kg) fish has also become the first tagged great white shark to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, as it journeys closer to the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Closing in: Lydia the great white shark has swum 248 miles in the past 72 hours and is currently less than 800 miles away from Britain (marked). It is not understood why she is moving in such a northerly direction

Last week it was predicted that the shark would arrive in British waters today, but Lydia took a detour which has also makes her the most northerly tagged great white shark ever tracked too.

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a ridge found along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.

This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates.

It forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate in the North Atlantic, and the African Plate from the South American Plate in the South Atlantic.

She was tagged as part of the Ocearch project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements.

Lydia’s progress can be followed on the project’s website.

Scientists have been following the ferocious fish for over a year as part of a ground-breaking ocean life study.

Lydia has swum 248 miles (400km) in the last 72 hours and is currently less than 800 miles (1,288km) away from Britain.

Record breaker: The deadly predator has also  become the first tagged shark of its species to cross the Mid Atlantic Ridge, an enormous underwater mountain range under the ocean

She has become the first tagged great white to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates - on the morning of March 9.

Great whites are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, 
New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the
 Gulf coast and Hawaii.

Shark biologist Ian Fergusson tweeted: ‘WhiteShark Lydia pinged in on the other side of MidAtlanticRidge! Welcome to the history books, #Lydia,’ while Chris Fischer, who is involved in the project, tweeted: '#Lydia turns E toward #UK continuing first doc Trans/Atl migration n hist!’

She has covered more than 19,400 miles since a tracking device was fitted to her near Florida as part of the Ocearch scientific project and can reach speeds of 35mph.

Scientists said they are shocked by her recent dash towards Europe. It is impossible to predict which way Lydia will travel, but she is currently pointing in the direction of Ireland and the UK, having journeyed further north.

‘I have no idea what to expect from her next. I've been working with sharks for a very long time now and I have never seen anything like this,’ said Dr Gregory Skomal, 52, senior fisheries biologist with Massachusetts Marine Fisheries.

‘It's anyone's guess where she is going to go next but she has been heading east so she might continue to do so.

‘In the last day we've had quite a few recordings after a little break. This is probably because she's starting to come a little higher up, where the water is warmer.

‘Though it's hard to predict what she'll do it'll be very exciting if she comes to you guys.

‘She's just short of 800 miles away from your coast now but in the grand scheme of things that really isn't far for her. It's all very exciting.

‘It's hard to say how long it might take her to get there. If she decides she wants to get to England she could get there in days.

‘Having said that, she is quite likely to meander. It could take her days, it could take her months, or it might not happen at all.

‘I think it would be great to see her turn up in the UK though.’

Lydia’s tag only gives her location when she nears the surface and the mighty shark left researchers anxious for days before providing an update, as she remained deep in the water.

The act of tagging the shark, let alone predicting where it will travel, was a feat in itself.

A 75,000lb hydraulic platform was used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device.

Though Lydia's journey is impressive, great whites are known for their marathon migrations.

In 2003 a great white nicknamed Nicole travelled from South Africa to Australia and back - a some 12,400 miles.

In recent years there have been several sightings of Great whites off the coast of Britain.

In September last year, fisherman David Bond said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of Looe in southern Cornwall.

The suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a 'giant shark' get close to his vessel.

All those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark, saying the creature was much larger, prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white.

Great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world, reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight.

Satellite tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long-distance journeys.

The OCEARCH Global Shark Tracker Project has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009.

The study has shown that Great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months.

They
 are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, 
New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the
 Gulf coast and Hawaii.

The 
creatures have a ferocious reputation but are responsible for between a
 third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each
 year.

They are highly adapted predators, detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away.

Their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth, arranged across several rows.

Gathering
 speed and approaching their prey from beneath, Great whites can leap 
clear of the water, breaching like whales to attack.

They commonly feed on sea lions, seals, small toothed whales, and sea turtles.

The predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year.

If food is scarce, the sharks will try to avoid fighting, instead engaging in a tail-slapping contest along the surface of the water. The winner delivers the most slaps.

Scientists
 do not have a reliable idea of the species' population across the 
world, but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and 
sharks being caught accidentally in nets.

They are listed as an endangered species.

On Friday, Lydia was spotted 1,000 miles from Cornwall and Ireland

@highlight

The satellite-tagged 15ft, 2,000lb great white is now just 780 miles away after she crossed the mid-Atlantic ridge found in the middle of the ocean

@highlight

It was predicted that she could arrive in British waters today, but Lydia took a 
detour north, which also makes her the most northerly tagged great white

@highlight

No one understands why she is taking such a strange route as great whites are usually found in warmer waters
