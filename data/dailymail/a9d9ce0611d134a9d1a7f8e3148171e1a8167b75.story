Dressed in white robes and high pointed hoods, children joined their parents to take part in Easter processions across Spain.

The youngsters were among the many hooded 'nazareno' penitents who gathered for religious ceremonies in Cordoba and Seville in Andalusia, on Sunday.

Hundreds of similar events take place throughout Spain during Easter Holy Week - known as Semana Santa.

Processions in Andalusia begin on Palm Sunday and reach their pinnacle after midnight on Good Friday, a time known as La Madrugada.

Many parents enlist their children in the brotherhoods at a very young age because it takes years to move up the ranks and earn a prestigious spot in a procession, such as the coveted position of carrying a great cross at the head. 

Most processions are at night, and many of those who take part carry long candles to light the way from their parish church to the cathedral and back again.

Some walk barefoot or even with shackles. In some of the biggest events, a group of Roman soldiers follows. 

Seville, the regional capital of Andalusia, hosts some of the biggest processions, dating back to medieval times and organised by brotherhoods, or cofradias, each sporting their own colours.

Although the hooded outfits worn by worshippers are similar to those used by members of the Klu Klux Klan, the processions have nothing to do with the KKK.
