The NFL will keep Super Bowl balls under 'added security' ahead of the game as the Deflategate investigation continues.

There will be 108 balls used in Arizona between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday - five times more than any other game.

Both teams will practice with the designated set, but the NFL will take them into their custody on Friday before they are inspected by officials three hours before kick off.

For two days they will be guarded by an independently-chosen equipment manager, the Chicago Bears' Tony Medlin, while ball attendants will handle pregame preparation.

Precautions: Vice president of NFL officiating Dean Blandino said the balls will be under 'added security' before the Super Bowl on Sunday. They will be looked after by an independent kit manager from Friday

During a press conference on Thursday, vice president of officiating Dean Blandino insisted that the heightened security wasn't a result of Deflategate but was normal protocol for the Super Bowl. 

He said: 'There will be some added security just because of the environment we're in for this game.

'The thing with the Super Bowl is during the first half, we rotate footballs in as much as possible, because then those balls are used for charity and NFL auction.' 

Referring back to the Patriots' AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts - where the scandal began - he said the inspection of the footballs by referee Walt Anderson was handled properly.

'My major concern is did we follow proper protocol?' Blandino said. 'Everything was properly tested and marked before the game. Walt gauged the footballs himself; it is something he has done throughout his career.

'Officiating is not part of the investigation.'

Responsibility: The Chicago Bears' Tony Medlin was chosen to take custody of the balls when the teams hand them over on Friday before they are inspected by officials three hours before kick off 

Investigation: The senior official hinted that there could be a league-wide review of how balls are prepared for games during the off season 

As the scandal continues, Blandino also hinted at the possibility of a league-wide review into pregame football preparations during the off season. 

'They're not logged and that's certainly something that could be a thought,' he added. 'They're tested, they make sure that they're in that acceptable range and then they basically mark the football to say this is an acceptable football in that proper specification.'

Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL, is expected to address the Deflategate issue for the first time during a press conference on Saturday. 

For over a week the Patriots have been hammered by questions about how 11 of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game did not meet NFL standards.

Response: Tom Brady (pictured at a press conference on Thursday) has denied having any involvement in the Deflategate scandal 

The NFL has hired attorney Ted Wells to look into the matter and the investigation is expected to last several weeks.  

Both Tom Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner, and coach Bill Belichick have denied any knowledge or involvement in what has become known in the American media as 'Deflategate'.

'I believe now 100 percent I have personally and we as an organization have followed every rule to the letter,' Belichick said. 'At no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or to gain an advantage.' 

'I want to make it clear that I believe unconditionally that the New England Patriots have done nothing inappropriate in this process or in violation of NFL rules,' Owner Robert Kraft told a packed conference hall.

'Tom, Bill and I have been together for 15 years, they are my guys, they are part of my family ... and I have never known them to lie to me.

'It bothers me greatly that their reputations and integrity and by association that of our team has been called into question this past week.'
