Regular selfie-takers may be more narcissistic than their photo-shy friends, according to a new study being conducted at the University of Georgia.

Researchers working on the study are trying to determine whether some people’s constant desire to snap pictures of themselves suggests that they are more self-absorbed.

Keith Campbell, a psychology professor at the University of Georgia leading the selfie study, told the Today show that previous research suggests three reasons people take selfies: 'self-absorption, a social connection and art.'

Self love: Researchers at the University of Georgia are trying to determine whether selfie-takers, such as Kim Kardashian, are more narcissistic 

He has called upon volunteers with a particular penchant for selfies to take one while in his lab so that he can study the effect that the image has on others. 

‘We’re going to have people rate those selfies to see if we can detect narcissism from some of those selfies,’ he explained.

And it’s not just narcissism that selfie takers need to worry about. Career experts are now saying that the rise in selfie taking could lead to the more regular snappers losing out on jobs.

Popularity contest: Dr Campbell says 'social connection' is another popular reason for taking selfies, as might be the case in Ellen DeGeneres's crowded Oscar selfie

'[Employers may wonder] do you get the line between private versus public and might you share something about their company if you worked there that was inappropriate?' career coach Hallie Crawford recently told KMOV. 

'In a career sense, it can really impact your brand.’   

The news will no doubt come as a blow to prolific public selfie takers such as Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan and Miley Cyrus, who are all famed for their seemingly non-stop stream of selfies. 

Dr Campbell, the author of The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement, said he's interested in studying selfies because 'It's a form of communication with simple self-expression.'

'It's just something we've never seen before, at least at this massive scale,' he added.
