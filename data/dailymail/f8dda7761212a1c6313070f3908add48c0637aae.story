Unexpected: The comedian was struck by an illness just minutes before he was due to perform

Legendary comedian Jerry Lewis was rushed to hospital in Sydney today, after falling ill minutes before he was about to perform to a club.

The 85-year-old entertainer, on his eighth tour of Australia to raise money for the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation, fell ill just before he was scheduled to entertain an expectant crowd.

Mr Lewis was so ill that he could not even get out of a car which brought him to the club last night. 

He was driven to hospital where he was admitted for tests but there was no immediate comment on his condition.

Mr Lewis had shown no sign of illness earlier in the day, conducting a series of newspaper, tv and radio interviews.

In true style, he had radio broadcaster Alan Jones roaring with laughter when he said he wasn't going to be in Sydney after all, but was flying to Brisbane.

When Jones asked why, Mr Lewis replied: 'I don't know - I just made that up. I haven't got anything else to say.'

Later he told another journalist that he loved coming to Australia, where people had always treated him like a friend since his first visit in 1970 when he ended up staying in Tasmania for four weeks.

'It's a beautiful country, filled with honest beautiful people,' he said.

Clearly the warm feeling is mutual, as when club patrons were told that he had been taken ill and would not be able to continue with his scheduled performance, the gave him a standing ovation and wished him good luck.

Mr
Richard Errington, chief executive officer of the Rooty Hill Returned 
Servicemen's League club, where Mr Lewis was due to perform, said he was
with the American when he arrived at the club's entrance.

Warm welcome: The popular comedian was given a standing ovation of support by the expectant crowd

'He looked ill. He couldn't even get out of the car,' said Mr Errington.

'He was pale and looked extremely unwell.

'But I was heartened when I went on to the stage to advise the sell-out crowd that he had had to cancel.

'I told the audience they could have refunds, but they rose as one and gave Jerry Lewis a personal standing ovation of support. They said his charity could keep their ticket proceeds as a donation.

'It was a touching gesture that was recorded and will be seen by Mr Lewis when he is well.'

During the past 61 years Mr Lewis has raised £1billion for the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation.
