Soaring numbers of 'wolf breed' dogs, such as Malamutes, are being abandoned by owners unable to cope with the pets

Soaring numbers of ‘wolf breed’ dogs are being abandoned by owners unable to cope with the pets - which have become popular after featuring in cult films and television shows such as Twilight and Game of Thrones.

Charities including The Dogs Trust say hundreds of dogs such as Malamutes, Huskies and Sarloos were given up last year because their demands for attention and exercise are proving too much.

And last week, six day-old Eliza-Mae Mullane was mauled to death by her parents’ pet Alaskan Malamute at their home in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire.

Police are currently still investigating the circumstances of the tot’s death and have not destroyed the dog.

The Dogs Trust, Britain’s largest dog rescue charity, has experienced a three-fold rise in wolf breed dogs brought to its rehoming centres.

The charity says it is ‘gravely concerned’ about the situation, saying unscrupulous breeders are also to blame, for selling the dogs to people in town-centre flats who were out at work all day and left them unattended.

Last year the trust took in 261 abandoned wolf-type dogs — up from 78 in 2010.

Although known for being friendly, affectionate and loyal, wolf breed dogs are also prone to separation anxiety and extreme boisterousness.

Steve Goward, training and behavioural advisor at The Dogs Trust, said: ‘These dogs are beautiful creatures and can make wonderful companions but they need owners who understand the demands of this breed and are in a position to offer a lifetime commitment.

‘We are seeing too many of these dogs being abandoned when they become too much for their owners and rescue centres have to pick up the pieces.’

Another animal rescue charity, Blue Cross, reported a five-fold increase in the number of dogs handed in over the last five years, from 10 in 2008 to 52 last year.

The organisation’s head of rehoming, Mandy Jones, said: ‘Copying your favourite celebrity’s hairstyle is one thing but we urge people to put a lot more thought into getting a new pet.

‘We see so many animals given up because their owners did not realise how much time and effort it takes to care for them.’

On Game of Thrones dire wolves, played by Northern Inuit dogs are adopted as pups by the children of nobleman Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean

She added: ‘Sadly, the ‘have-it-now’ attitude of today’s consumer society seems to be the same whether you are buying a handbag or a dog.’

Game of Thrones features dire wolves, played by Northern Inuit dogs which resemble a cross between a German shepherd and malamute.

On the show, the dogs are adopted as pups by the children of nobleman Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean, after being found in a forest moping around their dead mother, who had been killed by a deer.

The makers of the show had considered using actual wolves but they are illegal in the UK, where the series is filmed.
