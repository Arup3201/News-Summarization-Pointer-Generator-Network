Awkward: NFL commentator and Hall of Famer Warren Sapp found himself at the center of a controversy after he failed to leave a tip for a waitress in Florida citing bad service

NFL Hall of Famer Warren Sapp has come under fire for stiffing a waitress at a Florida sports bar Tuesday - but the former player insists he didn't tip the server only because the service was terrible.

The kerfuffle over Sapp's tipping habits erupted after a photo of his receipt from Upper Deck Ale and Sports Grille in Hallandale with a '0' scrawled where the tip was supposed to go went viral on social media.

To add insult to injury, the famed defensive tackle scrawled across the printout: 'Boys don't tip.'

On his Twitter page Wednesday, Mr Sapp defended his actions, writing that he decided to withhold gratuity on his bill totaling just under $70 because his server repeatedly called him and his companion 'boys.'

'No waitress will ever call me a boy twice after the 1st time & I say to her "when u look at me do u see a boy?" #HenceBoysDontTip' he tweeted to his 1.09million followers.

Sapp, 41, an analyst for NFL Network, headed to Upper Deck bar in Hallandale Tuesday afternoon to watch the epic World Cup match between Team USA and Belgium.

The 6-foot-2, 300-pound Hall of Famer and a friend ordered a pizza, a Reuben sandwich, a platter of wings, a bowl of crab soup and a bucket of beer, which came out to be $69.39.

Sapp was supposed to leave a minimum of $10.40, but the waitress named Corey came away from the transaction empty-handed.

According to the stamp on the receipt, Sapp asked for the check at 3.20pm, about 40 minutes before the start of the game.

He later explained on Twitter that he took off early because the 'service was worst.'

On Wednesday, the waitress spoke out for the first time since the tip-gate, offering her side of the story.

Corey D'Agata, 26, told radio host Andy Slater at 940 WINZ in Miami that she did nothing to offend the legendary football player, Larry Brown Sports reported.

‘We were busy. I walked over to his table. It was him and one other guy and I just said, “Hey, boys, what can I get you to drink?” and he stopped me right there,’ D’Agata recounted. ‘He said, “We’re not boys, I’m a man.” So then I called him “sugar” and “honey.”’

The bar worker said that she was not aware that the term ‘boys’ could be seen as offensive by someone, adding that when she serves female patrons she usually addresses them as ‘girls’ or ‘ladies.’ 

D'Agata has challenged Sapp’s assertion that the service at the eatery was so bad that he was forced to leave, telling the radio host that he stayed at the bar for the game and took off about an hour after Belgium beat the U.S.2-1.

Addressing the matter of the leaked receipt, the 26-year-old blamed her sister for sharing a snapshot of the bill she had sent to her in private on Facebook, where it spread like wildfire before it became a viral hit on Twitter thanks to ESPN's Darren Rovell.

He said, she said: The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle insisted that the service at the bar was bad, but the waitress, Corey D'Agata disputed his claims, saying that he did not have a word of complaint

Twitter users were split in their reaction to Sapp's decision to take a stand over the waitress' use of the term 'boys,' with some defending his tight-fisted move while others calling him out for stiffing the server.

Shaun King, Sapp’s former teammate on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, told TMZ Sports that the 41-year-old analyst is an excellent tipper so long as the service is good.

Meanwhile, Corey D'Agata’s manager at Upper Deck told TMZ Wednesday that the employee will be reprimanded, but he would not say if she stands to lose her job over the incident.
