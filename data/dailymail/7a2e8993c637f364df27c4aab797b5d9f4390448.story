Kendra Wilkinson's husband Hank Baskett has been hit with claims he paid for a sexual encounter with a transsexual model, amid reports that his marriage is on the rocks.

Now the transsexual model in question, Ava Sabrina London, has opened up about her alleged tryst with the former NFL star in a new interview with The National Enquirer.

London claims that Baskett first contacted her in April to set up a meeting after watching her videos on YouTube.

A family rocked by scandal: Hank Baskett, pictured with wife Kendra Wilkinson and son Hank Jr on May 16, has been accused by RadarOnline of cheating with a transsexual in late April - just weeks before this photo was taken

'I met Hank Baskett probably around the 22nd or 23rd of April this year,' the model told the publication. 'He contacted me through a video I had posted on YouTube and we exchanged information.'

She went on to describe how the former Minnesota Vikings wide receiver arrived unexpected one day, using a pseudonym (calling himself 'Steve') in an attempt to hide his identity.'Hank absolutely knew that I was a transsexual and he told me that I was the only transsexual he’s ever been with,' London stated. 'He thought I was beautiful.'

The model then described in graphic 
detail her sexual encounter with Baskett, which included many acts 
but, she insists, never culminated in actual sex. She did, however, make
 it clear that her client was 'very satisfied' after they both fondled 
each other's penises.

The former pro athlete took a shower to clean off after the '15-20 minute' session and paid London $500 before he left, according to London.

RadarOnline also reports that London underwent a polygraph test with polygrapher Joseph Paolella prior to her interview with the National Enquirer, to bring legitimacy to her claims.

Paolella concluded, according to Radar, there was 'no indication of deception during the polygraph examination' after she answered 'yes' to a barrage of questions - ranging from whether or not Baskett engaged in mutual masturbation, paid her for the session, knew that she was a transsexual, and paid her an additional sum on a second visit to her apartment to 'deny she ever met him'.

Radar also has surveillance footage from the National Enquirer which they claim is Baskett's vehicle arriving at the transsexual's condo on June 4, to pay her over $2000 to keep quiet about their tryst in April.

The video footage sees a truck that looks a lot like Baskett's arrive at the Los Angeles luxury condo through a second storey window.

London's interview comes as 
Kendra and Baskett have been weathering some negative reports lately 
about their five year marriage that has resulted in two children: Hank 
Jr, aged four, and Alijah, aged one month.

They have so much going for them: The couple, with Hank Jr and new baby girl Alijah, have been together for five years and have yet to comment on new reports their marriage is in trouble

Not only did The National Enquirer
 claim on Saturday that the 29-year-old Playboy cover girl kicked the 
former football star out of their Los Angeles home, but on Monday RadarOnline accused the 31-year-old athlete of cheating with London. Hank reportedly paid the woman $2,500 to keep her mouth shut.

This comes on the heels of claims that Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart also cheated with not one, but two transsexuals.

Reps for Kendra did not return calls to MailOnline.

The first time Hank met Ava, who goes under the YouTube handle Ava Masaniai, was 'around
 April 22 in Sherman Oaks, California,' an insider told Radar.

'He called 
her twice before they met in person. He said he’d seen her YouTube 
videos online, and he couldn’t believe that her photos were real,' the source told Radar.

At
 the time Kendra, who came to fame on E!'s The Girls Next Door, was 
eight months pregnant with their second child, Alijah, who was born in 
May.

The timing couldn't be any worse: the Kendra On Top stars are set to ring in their five year wedding anniversary on Friday.

Baskett tried his best to keep the alleged affair a secret.

'He used a fake name when organizing the encounter,' the source told Radar, 'and claimed he had never been with a transsexual before.'

He met Ava - who has 60 YouTube videos - at her home. During their first encounter, 'they mutually masturbated' and he touched her 'breasts and penis.'

'The
 entire encounter lasted probably about 15 to 20 minutes,' Radar's 
insider claimed. 'Before leaving, he gave her almost $500 and told her 
he wanted to stay in touch.'

And in touch they kept. 'They spoke a couple times after their first sexual encounter. Hank always called from different numbers, and at least once from a pay phone,' Radar reported.'After the Casper Smart transsexual controversy, he started to get freaked out and paranoid she would say something, and called her six times in one day to plead with her not to spill.'

Lopez broke up with Smart in early June after it was reported he romanced transsexuals Xristina Marie and Sofie Vissa. He denied being with either woman. The 44-year-old singer has since moved on to Dancing With The Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy.

Hank used money to keep LA-based London (who studied at Modesto College) quiet, Radar claimed. 'He promised he would take care of her financially, and even left her $2,000 in a coffee cup at her house.

'He promised her $5,000 to keep her mouth shut, and even threatened to kill himself if the story got out!'

Kendra, who was last seen with Hank on Saturday as the two ran errands with Alijah, wants to leave him, according to the site.

On Saturday The Enquirer reported that Hank was spotted speeding away from 
their home on Friday and looked 'downtrodden' as he arrived at the motel with bags in hand.

The
source told the publication: 'He went into the office of the motel and 
then pulled the jeep around to the other side where the room was 
located. Hank appeared disoriented and downtrodden. At one point, he 
kicked the ground.'

A new trend?: Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart, pictured in May, was also accused of seeing not one, but two transsexuals

The
Enquirer claimed Hank was joined by a woman wearing a 'medical type 
uniform' and speculated it could be one of the children's nurses.

The
insider said: 'He got out of the Jeep with a woman who appeared to 
possibly be one of the couples’ baby nurses because she was wearing a 
medical type uniform.

'An hour later, he emerged from the room but then returned back inside.'

Hank spent most of Friday with his father Hank Sr at a Major League Gaming Competition in Anaheim.

He tweeted: Mornin yall! @MrHankBaskettSr
& I are on our way down to the #MLGAnaheim championships. Small 
road trip with pops=good times.'

No idea what was coming! Kendra shared this upbeat tweet on Thursday

He later wrote on Instagram: '#MLGAnaheim. The calm before the storm. Best of luck to mlg and all those playing this weekend!'

However, after returning to the house, Hank abruptly left the property at 4pm for the motel.

There was no sign of his father.

The 
allegations of marital discord come just one day after Kendra took to 
Twitter to post an upbeat message, writing: 'Today will be a great day. I
 know it. #CarpeDiem #smile #happiness #love #positivevibes.'

And earlier on Friday she flashed a happy smile as she stepped out in baggy sweats that covered up her postpartum figure.

Kendra and Hank married June 27, 2009 and welcomed Hank Jr in December of the same year.

The blonde has spilled her family secrets on Kendra and Kendra On Top. It is not yet known if she could turn her new alleged marital woes into a reality spinoff much like Tori Spelling has done.
