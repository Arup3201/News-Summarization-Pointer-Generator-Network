Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to lead the line for PSG in their Champions League last-16 first leg clash against Chelsea at the Parc de Princes on Tuesday night.

The unpredictable forward has never been short of words, or self-belief for that matter, and he will be hoping to have the last laugh against former manager Jose Mourinho.

But as the Chelsea defence prepares to keep the PSG striker quiet, Sportsmail reminds you of 10 of the Sweden international's best quotes.

'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.'

Ibrahimovic may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 Ballon d'Or award, but it clearly didn't affect the striker's confidence in his own ability.

'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' 

Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn't much point in watching a tournament that didn't feature himself.

'I couldn’t believe it. I was like "No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions".'

Arsene Wenger revealed that he came close to signing Ibrahimovic when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old but he refused to have a trial at the north London club.

Ibrahimovic has no need to buy his wife a birthday present because she already has him

'Nothing. She already has Zlatan.' 

As any man will attest to, buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task. Not for Ibrahimovic though, who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has Zlatan.

'Well, I don’t know. You’ll have to ask your wife about that.'

As a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing Ibrahimovic. This reporter wasn't, and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face.

'What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange.'

Ibrahimovic didn't take too kindly to criticism from Scandinavian counterpart and former Aston Villa and West Ham striker John Carew.

'Come  to my house  and you'll see if I'm gay, and bring your sister.'

During his spell at Barcelona a picture emerged of  Ibrahimovic getting rather close to team-mate Gerard Pique but the Sweden international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay, particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter.

'It was the fault of David Trezeguet, who made me do one drink of vodka after another. I slept in the bathtub. Now I hold my vodka much better.' 

Ibrahimovic tried to pass the blame to former Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club's Serie A title success.

'I like fireworks too, but I set them off in gardens or kebab stands. I never set fire to my own house.' 

After Mario Balotelli, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic's at Inter Milan, set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window, the PSG hitman admitted his like for fireworks.

'You bought a Ferrari but you drive it like a Fiat.'

Ibrahimovic's short and tumultuous stint in La Liga with Barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs, particularly with manager Pep Guardiola and the 33-year-old was not happy with his role in the team.
