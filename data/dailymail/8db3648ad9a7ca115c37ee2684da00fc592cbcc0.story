An occasional dessert lifts family mood and improves interactions

Good news for those who have struggled to maintain their New Year's diets - new research has revealed that eating dessert can really be good for you.

The research, which explores everyday eating habits, has identified that an  occasional dessert lifts family mood and improves interactions.

It also shows how children can benefit from family meals - they are more likely  to succeed in life, be healthier, do better at school, have higher self-esteem  and are less likely to develop eating disorders.

Professor Geoffrey Beattie - who was once a psychologist for Big Brother - and advised on the study, said: 'We've known that sharing food has huge psychological, cultural and emotional significance. It's a critical part of our evolution and core to our everyday social world.

'This study identified that occasionally eating a dessert is producing a blip of happiness which is positively affecting families' mood, influencing how families are interacting with each other, and is creating happy memories.' 

A spokesman for Coppenrath & Wiese, who commissioned the research, said: 'I know that we all see eating dessert as routine and commonplace.

'But I'm sure we've all experienced the flicker of anticipation and excitement when we know that there is a treat on the way.

'We had no idea that the humble dessert could have such a psychological effect. It seems like the occasional dessert really could give British families a feel-good boost.'

1. It seems that many of us have got out of the habit of sitting down as a family and having a meal together. Discuss as a family why it would be a good thing. We all need time for each other away from our hectic lives. It may be inconvenient at first, but the positive benefits will make it really worthwhile.

2. Start small and realistically. One evening a week, a special occasion, with everyone helping to prepare, cook, setting the table, clearing up etc. Anticipate the event, keep it fun. Everyone then has a stake in having a good time, the responsibility does not fall on one individual.

3. Try to avoid cooking several different meals. It is about sharing food.

4. The focus should be on the meal itself and the interaction, turn the TV, phones etc off. It is an opportunity to talk positively, don't use it as an opportunity to complain, accuse, challenge etc.

If you have to do these, do them elsewhere. Use the time wisely. Reminisce as a family. Research suggests that what you talk about during the meal is one of the most important elements in promoting well-being and happiness.

5. Make it clear that this is something that the whole family should try. It may sound strange that something as basic as a family meal has to be approached in this way. But for many it will be a step into the unknown. Rediscover the joy of thinking as a family.
