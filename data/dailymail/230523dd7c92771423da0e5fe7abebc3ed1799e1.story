Britain's love of the banger is fizzling out.

Total UK sales have fallen by 6.2 per cent in the last two years, which means the nation is eating some 423million fewer sausages a year.

The industry puts the fall down to the rise in the cost of pork, which is now at an historic high, taking the cost of a pack of sausages up by some 12.5per cent in a year.

Sales of sausages have fallen in the UK by 6.2 per cent in the last two years, which means the nation is eating some 423million fewer sausages a year

Some value packs of sausages have risen even more steeply at the big supermarket chains. For example, a pack of eight Sainsbury's British Cumberland Sausages is up from £1 to £1.40 over the past nine months.

However, other factors such as renewed health concerns about the impact of eating red meat may also have led some families to cut back.

The slow decline of sausage sales comes as families and children increasingly switch to imported fast food options such as pizza, pasta and curry.

The pork sausage is a particularly British delicacy, however it has had its critics over the years given concerns over the rather grim ingredients and gristle that have been used in some products.

The industry has responded to this by producing a raft of new gourmet versions flavoured with herbs and fruit.

The problems of sausage sales have been revealed by Devro, the Scottish maker of the collagen skins that are used as cases for sausages, chipolatas, salamis, and bratwurst.

Shoppers have increasingly turned either to the lowest-cost brands from budget chains, or to top-end 'black tray' sausages that are encased in traditional animal gut

Chief executive, Peter Page, said Britons have particularly lost the taste for mid-market brands such as supermarket own label creations, where sales were down 7per cent in the past two years.

Nearly three-quarters of UK households still buy sausages, according to research for the industry group, BPEX, and Kantar World Panel.

However, shoppers have increasingly turned either to the lowest-cost brands from budget chains, or to top-end 'black tray' sausages that are encased in traditional animal gut.

Sales through the likes of Aldi and Lidl, where prices for sausages appear at least 10per cent cheaper, are up by around 24per cent in two years.

Shares in Devro – which makes enough casing to stretch several times around the world – fell by 9 per cent on Tuesday, after the company said demand for sausages had been subdued.

But while the British may be cutting back on sausages, the picture is very different in China where pork consumption is growing rapidly among the burgeoning middle class.

Devro is spending £50m constructing a plant in China which will start production in 2016 amid expectations that the country will make up half of global sausage consumption within a few years.

It is believed that the sausage was first brought to these shores by the Romans around 400AD. The word derives from the Latin salsisium, meaning something that has been salted.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first specific reference in English came in a fifteenth century vocabulary publication, which described the 'sawsage'.

It was in the reign of Charles I that sausages were divided into links for the first time in Britain. Once made, they were put up chimneys in the home to be mildly cured.

Each region developed their own methods of manufacture and flavours with butchers in Lincolnshire favouring fresh sage and those in Cheshire using caraway and coriander. Today, the industry calculates there are more than 470 recipes.

They came to be known as bangers during the Second World War. This was because their high water content meant that they were liable to explode when cooked as the water turned to steam.

BPEX said while the number of sausages sold is down, the value of sales is up by around £70million over the last two years to some £773million. This is partly because of the higher cost of pork, but also because families are opting for gourmet creations.

Director Mick Sloyan insisted the sausage is still a family essential. 'Research has shown people are trading up from value sausages to premium sausages which are becoming a main meal item.

'That shift is part of the reason for the increase in value as people look for better quality.'
