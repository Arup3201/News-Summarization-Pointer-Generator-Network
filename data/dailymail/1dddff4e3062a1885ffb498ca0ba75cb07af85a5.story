Calf triplets have been born on a dairy farm in the North West of England at an extraordinary 700,000-1 odds.

The three male calves came into the world at Greenhouse Farm, Wirral, this week after their mother, number 901, made the 'surprise' delivery.

Farmer Jon Appleby has never heard of a trio of cows being born at the same time from the same mother, despite working on the farm all of his life.

700,000-1 odds: Proud farmer Jon Appleby has never heard of a trio of cows being born at the same time from the same mother, despite working on the farm in Wirral all of his life

Jon, 44, said: 'I've been here for over four decades and my dad has been farming for 75 years. We've never heard of cows having triplets. It's very very rare.

'I couldn't quite believe it when I saw three calves. She'd had two and we thought that was it - it's not uncommon for twins to be born.

'But we looked again and a third had been born. She was in a field on her own so they're definitely all hers!'

Jon, who runs Greenhouse Farm in 
Greasby, Wirral, with his wife Joy, has 74 cows in total and since they 
began calving at the beginning of August, they have had around 180 new 
arrivals.

Family portrait: the triplets are 'the most special of the farm's new generation'

However the triplets are without a doubt, the most special of the farm's new generation.

Father-of-two Jon said: 'They are all boys and because they arrived so soon after the Royal baby, we decided to call them George, Louis and Alexander.

'It's a little moment in history us having such a rare arrival so it was only right to mark the occasion.

Come along: Apart from 73 other cows, the farm has more than 3,000 hens and houses a free range egg business

'Number 901 was big during her pregnancy so we expected twins but it never even crossed our minds we might have triplets. It's incredible.'

The family also house more than 3,000 hens and run a free range egg business from the farm. Only last week, they cracked one to find it was a triple yolker.

'It had to be a sign,' said Jon. 'People get excited over double yolkers, but we had a triple and then a few days later had triplet calves. Someone was trying to tell us something!'

The three young calves are not idential triplets, which means they have come from three separate embryos

The calves are not identical, meaning they have come from three separate embryos.

For the last two years, number 901 has given birth to single calves, and there is no indication that after having triplets, she may do this in the future.

Jon said: 'We will just have to wait and see. It would be unbelievable if it happened to us again with such unlikely odds, but we will wait and see!

'For now we will enjoy the triplets. They are incredibly cute and certainly have the 'aww' factor!'

And Jon's children, Ben, 14, and Theo, 10, are thrilled by their new additions.

Jon added: 'They think they are great. It's lovely that we have got them. The kids are chuffed to bits.

'They like to help feed them - they'll be weaned off their mother soon so Ben and Theo will be getting their hands dirty!'
