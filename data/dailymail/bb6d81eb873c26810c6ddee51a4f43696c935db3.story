The convert widow of a 7/7 bomber who is being hunted by the CIA is thought to be on the run with a British terror suspect who goes by the name 'Osama', it has been revealed.

Fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite - once a 
fresh-faced school girl in Aylesbury - is believed to be travelling with a
variety of aliases after apparently escaping capture following a raid by anti-terrorist police on an Al Qaeda gang plotting a bomb plot on a packed shopping mall in the coastal town of Mombasa in Kenya.

The gang is believed to be
planning more '7/7'-style attacks in Britain, and police are urgently 
trying to track the 28-year-old, who is believed to have links to al-Qaeda as 
well as extremists in the UK.

She is thought to be on the run with 
Habib Salah Ghani, a 26-year-old from Hounslow, west London, and could be carrying more than 500 bomb fuses and 
bundles of U.S. dollars.

Last night, there were reports the pair, believed to be in a relationship, could have fled to Tanzania, south of Kenya with her children, the Sun said.

Police described Ghani, who calls himself 'Osama', as 'very dangerous'. In December his name was released along with 14 others believed to hold key information that could help unravel the notorious al Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab militia.

The newspaper said police want to speak to him about his alleged links to the Mombasa bomb plot.

Lewthwaite was in an arranged marriage with Jermaine Lindsay, the King's Cross bomber who blew himself up in the 2005 terror attack near Russell Square, which cost 26 people their lives.

The international man-hunt is 
focusing on the woman who escaped from an extraordinary raid in 
December.

Missing: Samantha Lewthwaite during her school days. Her family in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, say they have not seen her for several years

She is carrying a passport in the name of Samantha Lewthwaite,
and police in both Kenya and Britain 'strongly suspect' she is the 7/7 
terrorist's widow, rather than another woman using Lewthwaite's details.

Police say their suspect has used a passport with a photo bearing a 
striking resemblance to the 28-year-old Muslim convert but with the name
of an unwitting South African-born nurse, Natalie Faye Webb, 26, from Essex.

There are fears that up to 50 British 
Islamic militants are receiving terrorist training in Kenya and 
neighbouring Somalia, described by experts as a 'destination of choice' 
for would-be terrorists.

Following the 7/7 bombings, 
Lewthwaite described her husband's actions as 'abhorrent', and her family 
are adamant she is not involved in terrorist activities.

Her father Andy, 56, a builder and 
former soldier, has begged his daughter to come home, saying 'Samantha 
would not be involved in anything to do with terrorism.

'She was badly affected by what happened before and would have nothing to do with it. I am sure of that.'

However the CIA, Scotland Yard and 
anti-terror forces around the world are treating her capture as a huge 
priority. Sources say she is 'no small fish' in terrorist circles, describing her role as a 'financier'.

Kenyan authorities believe the pair fled after another Londoner Jermaine Grant, was
captured during the Mombasa raid on December 19, but Lewthwaite apparently fled with a laptop and the bomb parts.

Her escape was described as so extraordinary, that police are holding an internal probe to see if she had 'inside' help.

Urgent hunt: The false passport of 'Natalie Faye Webb' - thought to be terror widow Samantha Lewthwaite - who has allegedly escaped from Mombasa with bomb fuses

Kenyan police say the woman they are hunting fled the gang’s hideout 
before they raided the house, where more than 60 rounds of 
AK47 ammunition and other weapons were discovered.

Grant, 29, of Newham, East 
London, was arrested. He has been charged with possessing bomb-making 
equipment and conspiring to cause an explosion and is due to go on trial
in May over what sources call a ‘serious’ terrorist plot.

The dramatic disclosure came after a briefing from officials in Nairobi.

Police spokesman Erick 
Kiraithe said: ‘We know quite a bit about her now. She had three 
identities in the past and that [Samantha Lewthwaite] is one possible 
identity. Our expectation is that our counter-terror team should be able
to locate her soon.’

Police say they will not confirm the woman they are searching for is 
Miss Lewthwaite until she is captured because it is possible her 
identity could have been stolen.

Yesterday Miss Lewthwaite’s family, 
in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said they have not seen her ‘for years’ 
but believed she was in South Africa.

Her uncle Nigel Lewthwaite, 51, said he understood she had married again, to another Muslim man.

He said: ‘Her father only found out 
that she’d had another child when she left this country. He just isn’t 
in contact with her. I don’t know anybody in her family who is.

‘Her father thought she was in South 
Africa, but we don’t know. We don’t even know when she left the country.
Apparently she’s married another Muslim man and her father thought she 
was in South Africa.'

Location: Lewthwaite fled before the raid in Mombasa, and police are hunding for her in Nairobi, located 200 miles away, as well as across the border

Miss Lewthwaite converted to Islam at the age of 15 and married 
unemployed carpet fitter Lindsay in 2002.

Three years later, while she 
was seven months pregnant with their second child, Jamaican-born Lindsay
detonated his rucksack bomb on a Piccadilly Line train, killing 26 of 
the 52 who died in the July 7 bombings.

She later issued the statement 
saying the attacks were ‘abhorrent’.

The Metropolitan Police has sent a team to the Kenyan capital to assist 
in the hunt, which comes amid mounting concern over the number of 
British extremists going to Kenya and Somalia, which officials now 
regard as the ‘destination of choice’ for would-be terrorists.

There are fears some militants could return to carry out attacks in the 
UK after receiving training in Somalia from the Al Qaeda-linked al 
Shabaab rebel group.

Convert: Mother-of-three Samantha Lewthwaite

As a teenage Home Counties schoolgirl, Samantha Lewthwaite wore make-up and pretty dresses and went to parties with her friends.

But by the time she was 17, the soldier’s daughter had converted to Islam, was covering her hair in a hijab, changed her name to Asmantara, and was readying herself to marry the man who would go on to take part in the 7/7 attacks.

The youngest of three children, Miss Lewthwaite was born in Banbridge, County Down, in 1983 to Christine and soldier Andrew, who was serving in Northern Ireland.

Her parents moved to Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, but separated when she was 11. Friends say she sought comfort in Islam after being badly affected by the split.

After learning about the Muslim faith in religious studies lessons at school, the teenager told friends she was converting. Within two years, she was wearing the jilbab, the long gown that covers everything but the hands and face.

While studying for a degree in religion and politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London she met Jamaican-born Jermaine Lindsay, a fellow Muslim convert, through an Islamic chatroom. In October 2002 they married in an Islamic ceremony in Aylesbury.

In 2004 their first son was born, which is when she says her husband first started to spend time at radical mosques in London, Luton and Yorkshire. She has said she believes his mind was poisoned by these visits because before this he had been a ‘peaceful man’.
