It was the annual family holiday which turned into a nightmare for a seven-year-old girl and left two sisters orphans.

Now the violent murder of Elaine Jones which triggered her husband's death after he pulled her mutilated body from a river near the family campsite may be attributed to the notorious serial rapist and murderer known as 'Mr Stinky'.

Detective Chief Inspector John Lehmann of the NSW Unsolved Homicide Squad said Mr Stinky, the name given to Raymond Edmunds because of the foul odour noticed by his rape victims, may have murdered Ms Jones on January 3, 1980, Fairfax reported.

Prime suspect: Notorious serial rapist and murderer Raymond Edmunds (pictured) aka 'Mr Stinky' was camping on a nearbvy island in the Murray River in January 1980 when Elaine Jones was raped and her throat slit in a vicious murder which has remained unsolved

Edmunds, who was sentenced in 1986 for life in a Victorian jail for the double murder of  two teenagers in 1966, was reportedly camping on Ulupna Island in the Murray River, just 20km from where Ms Jones was abducted and brutally slain.

Elaine Jones, 39, and her husband Alan, a 51-year-old welder from Box Hill in Melbourne, were camping at Tocumwal town beach caravan park, on the NSW-Victoria border, as they had every Christmas New Year period for 18 years.

Ms Jones left her husband with their daughters, Nita, 15 and seven-year-old Jennifer in their tent at around 9.30pm on a Thursday night to walk to the shops and buy chocolate and cigarettes.

Police believe she reached the shops, but she never returned to the campsite. Mr Jones alerted police the following morning and then decided to go searching for his wife with Jennifer in a dinghy.

Over a kilometre downstream, they saw a leg protruding from the water and Mr Jones recognised his wife's shoe on the body which had snagged on a river log. 

 

Protruding leg: Alan Jones and daughter Jennifer, 7, spotted a leg poking out from the Murray river at Tocumweal (pictured) and Mr Jones retrieved the body of his wife and pulled her into the dinghy before he had a massive heart attack and died, leaving Jennifer to swim ashore and call for help

Favourite spot: Alan and Elaine Jones had holidayed in the tourist town of Tocumwal (above) on the NSW Victorian border for 18 years before she was raped and murdered and he died from a massive heart attack leaving their two daughters orphans in 1980

Mr Jones pulled his wife's body aboard. Her throat had been slit from ear to ear, cut so deeply it exposed her spinal column.

Mr Jones covered the body with life jackets, started up the motor and was accelerating away when he collapsed and died from a massive heart attack; he had suffered from a heart problem for years.

The boat circled for several minutes before Jennifer could stop the motor, jump out and swim 30m to shore. Horrified onlookers then retrieved the boat with the two bodies.

Jennifer and her sister, Nita, 15, were taken to a family friend's place in Tocumwal before being sent to their maternal grandmother in Hobart.

A post mortem later determined Elaine Jones had died from massive head injuries sustained when a blunt weapon was used to fracture her skull. Her body was also bruised and she had been sexually assaulted.

Detectives  described the injuries as 'the work of a maniac' and vowed to hunt down the killer. But at the tim eof the murder, the local population of 1300 had swollen to 10,000 with the influx of holiday makers, fruit pickers and a local nudist convention, and the case remained unsolved.

In 2000, police looked at Edmunds as the possible killer. Now 70 years old, Edmunds is suspected of raping at least 30 women in Melbourne's eastern suburbs in the 1970s and 1980s.

He was convicted of three rapes and two attempted trapes committed in the 1970s and sentenced to life for raping and murdering 18-year-old panel beater Garry Heywood and 16-year-old Abina Madill; Heywood was shot through the head with a .22  rifle and Madill was raped and bludgeoned to death.

Edmunds was said to have  raped and beaten his first wife and sexually abused their three-year-old daughter before he became the man dubbed 'the Donvale rapist' in Melbourne.

He is also on the suspect list for Victoria's unsolved serial killings, of women who bodies were dumped in the scrub at Tynong North, in Victoria west Gippsland area 80km south-east of Melbourne.

In late 1980 a man dumping animal remains uncovered a human dumping site. 

Police found the remains of Ann-Marie Sargent, 18,  Bertha Miller, 73 and 14-year-old named Catherine  Headland. All the victims came from south-eastern Melbourne.

Three years later, they found Narumol Stephenson, 34, who had been abducted from Northcote in Melbourne's north-east November 1980.

Chief Inspector Lehmann said that in 2011 the NSW Government had offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer of Elaine Jones, but a lack of forensic evidence and the number of people in  Tocumwal at the time of the murder had hampered investigations.

'It's obviously difficult dealing with the grief of the family when you have no answers for them,' he said. 'People for whatever reason have knowledge they may have witheld because of relationships with the offender and, hopefully, those relationships have changed over the years.'
