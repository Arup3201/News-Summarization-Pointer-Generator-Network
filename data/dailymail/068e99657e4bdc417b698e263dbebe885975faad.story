Three months after her affair with married Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, exploded into the public eye, company marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg, has broken her silence online to apparently proclaim her love for the multi-billionaire.

Miss Rosenberg, 27, briefly disappeared from social media when the affair which rocked the internet giant was revealed at the end of August. 

But now she has apparently made it very clear that the romance is still very much on, with an instagram post a few days ago featuring a scribbled ink drawing of Mr Brin alongside the caption: S x A <3 (a symbol for 'heart').

You do the math: Amanda Rosenberg's instagram post that reveals her romance with her married multi-billionaire boss at Google is still going strong, three months after it exploded into the public eye and shook the internet giant

The less than flattering image of the Mr Brin drew comments from her friends. One joked, 'You forgot the Glass,' - a reference to the Google Glasses which Miss Rosenberg is tasked with marketing.

Another noted, 'Looks like a homeless guy I saw on the subway,' a nod to the now infamous picture of the wealthy Mr Brin sitting on a New York subway train.

When their affair was exposed at the 
end of August a spokesperson for Mr Brin was forced to reveal  that the 
40-year-old – whose fortune stands at $23billion – has been living 
separately from his wife, mother of their two children, Anne Wocjcicki 
for several months.

They are not legally separated and, according to their spokesman,’ they remain good friends and partners.’

Earlier this year Miss Rosenberg was photographed alongside Mr Brin at New York Fashion Week and it is not known how long the couple have been dating.

Miss Rosenberg stopped tweeting just days before her romance with her boss was revealed and has been uncharacteristically quiet online until the last few weeks.

Now British Miss Rosenberg – who attended $48,000 a year Marlborough College, the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge – is back online and has posted a string of flamboyant and bizarrely intimate tweets over the past month.

Her return to the Twittersphere includes such tweets as one posted on 27 October when she tweeted: ‘It’s that time of month when Tampax sends my vagina into space.’

Elsewhere she poked fun at a book cover featuring a girl, legs aloft sitting next to a faceless stranger. 'Certain girls unabashedly break wind at uncertain girls: A novel,' she tweeted.

California dreamin': Amanda wrote on her blog that she was initially so shy in her new role in Google's Silicon Valley HQ she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing she would be 'the weird loner in the corner'

And in another from 22 October when she joked: ‘Wedged between 2 kids’ car seats. Now have soggy Cheerios stuck in sexy places.’

Questions were raised as to whether Miss Rosenberg’s affair with her married boss was a breach of the company’s own code of conduct.

It reads: ‘Romantic relationships with co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of interest.

‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google?

‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper of a blog? If the answer to any of these questions if “yes”, the relationship of situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’

Until news of their affair broke the most controversial element in Miss Rosenberg’s life were the computerized Google Glasses she is charged with marketing. 

She has been credited with coming up with the ‘Ok, Glass’ command for the Google Glass.

An employee of Google since she graduated with a communications degree from Leeds University, she initially worked for the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Fransisco to work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre.

She soon won a role promoting the widely criticized Google Glass. The glasses enable users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners.

Before her affair with Mr Brin came to light she had already been romantically linked to another Google executive, Hugo Barra. The product management director for Android recently announced he was leaving the firm to take a job in China.

She wrote an online blog when she arrived – describing herself as ‘a misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian optimism.

‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, life. Then one day I realised the beauty had faded.

‘So I applied for a transfer within my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer!‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would…NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that!’

According to Miss Rosenberg she was so shy on her arrival that she failed to turn up to her first work drinks invitation, fearing that she would be ‘the weird loner in the corner.’

She also describes herself as ‘part of the master race that is the Chinese Jew or Chew if you will.‘Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK. A misanthrope who’s bad at maths, so I got the worst of both worlds.'
