When you have to chop up spring onions with an axe, you'd better be hungry.

And when pudding involves being rescued from a creme brulee, you may have bitten off more than you can chew.

Welcome to the wacky world of photographer Christopher Boffoli.

His pictures of tiny model people in a world of giant food - featured in his book Big Appetites - give a whole new perspective to getting your greens.

They certainly are a feast for the eyes.

Tip-top job: Two painters polish off some asparagus while a third takes a tea break on the luxurious stalk

Cake walk: Grandpa ploughs through the lemon sherbert icing - but the boy could end up with a soggy bottom

Eggs-plorers: Keep those hard hats on as you venture in, boys - looks like you could be at risk of shell shock

Florets and the machine: Good food and a bit of exercise - this little gardener knows how to stay healthy

A berry nasty crime scene: They better get all the evidence for this tragedy or the case could crumble

Let's hope the lawnmower doesn't run out of juice: This character shows how to peel an orange the hard way

The spice guys: Chainsaws make short work of these cinnamon sticks. But sweet little dust heaps are piling up

I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK. I sleep all night and, er... chop up spring onions all day. Poor guy's got a way to go

In a sticky situation: A woman flounders in the creme brulee. At least she isn't desserted in this travesty
