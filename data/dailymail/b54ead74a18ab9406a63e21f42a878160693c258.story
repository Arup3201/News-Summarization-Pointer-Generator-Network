Chancellor George Osborne announced a new ‘diverted profits tax’ in last week's Autumn Statement

A new ‘Google tax’ on giant US firms shifting their profits abroad was ridiculed today after it emerged businesses will have to report themselves to the taxman.

The levy, which was introduced by George Osborne in last week’s Autumn Statement, is overwhelmingly backed by the public.

But it emerged today that under the new scheme companies will be asked to ‘self-report’ how much tax they have avoided. 

One tax expert said: ‘It's a bit like reporting yourself to the police and then having to defend yourself.’

Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, added: ‘It seems strange that multinationals would have to report themselves and the the onus is on them to defend their [tax activities.]’

But a Treasury source stressed the new tax would be hard to avoid.

'This is a legal requirement. We are going to check up on it and it will be enforced,' the source said.

The Treasury estimates the Google tax will raise just £25million in 2015-16 – rising to £355million by 2019-20.

Mr Osborne last week claimed the new ‘diverted profits tax’ – targeting firms who ‘export’ profits to countries with lower corporation taxes than Britain – would raise £1billion over five years.

Many large technology companies are based in Ireland due to the country's 12.5 per cent corporation tax. The same tax in the UK is 20 per cent.

Despite the controversy over the tax the Government will take encouragement from new polling which reveals it is the most popular policy included in the Autumn Statement last week.

According to a new ComRes/ITV News poll six in ten Britons say the new tax on the profits of companies who operate in the UK but transfer their profits offshore is good for them personally.

The plans, outlined in the Autumn Statement, aim to clamp down on companies such as Google and Facebook who declare their profits in countries with lower taxes than the UK.

The ‘Google tax’ was even more popular than the stamp duty cuts announced by Mr Osborne.

The publication of the new rules comes after Washington’s ambassador to the UK vigorously defended Google and other multinational firms yesterday.

Matthew Barzun leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies, saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments.

David Cameron warned in October that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying UK taxes would be made to ‘damn well pay’. 

American ambassador Matthew Barzun told journalists  it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’

Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has previously said if tax rules were to change his firm  'will comply'

Mr Barzun told journalists in Westminster it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’ despite the fact they pay little, if any, corporation tax in this country.

‘I’m not the spokesman for any of those great American companies,’ he said. ‘These companies and other companies… are clever about using international rules that exist, as written, by the way, by all of us – that’s US government, British government – we make these rules and they are playing by them.

‘And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.’

Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years. Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax. And Amazon, which sold goods worth £4.3billion in the UK last year, paid just £4.2million.

The firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules. But their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the UK.
