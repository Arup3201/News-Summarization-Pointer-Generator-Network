A heartbroken man jumped to his death from a bridge just hours after his long-term partner passed away at their Atlanta home, relatives have revealed.

Mark Rhea Castleberry, 55, left a note in his car telling authorities where to find the body of 66-year-old Gregory Woodlief, who died following a long illness.

Woodlief's body was later found at their home in Chamblee. The couple had worn matching rings and, before leaving, Castleberry had removed his and placed it on Woodlief's body.

Castleberry, who previously worked for the Miss Atlanta Scholarship Pageant, committed suicide by plunging from the northbound 1-285 overpass to ground below during Monday's morning commute.

'My brother pretty much lost his mind and
 leapt,' his sister Ginger Castlberry Holt told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'He didn't want to be in a world that Greg wasn't.'

Castleberry, who had been with Woodlief for 30 years, had left a note in his car notifying authorities how to contact his sister. The note also gave Woodlief's name and their address.

The DeKalb Medical Examiner is still determining the cause of Woodlief's death, but a police spokeswoman said it was not being investigated as a homicide.

Authorities said they are awaiting the results of toxicology results before determining an official cause of death.

Holt said that officials indicated the death was due to natural causes.

Arrest: He was fired from the pageant after admitting to theft and the couple became withdrawn

Although 
friends had known that he was sick, the couple had never gone into 
detail about the nature of illness, which had left him emaciated and 
caused the couple to retreat.

Castleberry worked for the Miss Atlanta Scholarship Pageant as the volunteer executive director from 2000 to 2013, but he resigned after he was arrested on theft charges.

He admitted to stealing more than $12,000 from two professional acquaintances by writing checks in his name, the AJC reported.

He emailed the colleagues about what he had done, explaining that he had been in a dire financial situation and promising to re-pay them, but police were contacted.

Chamblee Police Captain Ernesto Ford said Castleberry had no previous criminal record and had found himself 'in a bind'.

He said he did not know if the financial struggles were caused by Castleberry's partner's illness.

Russell Kirby, the co-director of the Miss Atlanta Pageant, said the men withdrew following the arrest.

'They were both very proud,' he said. 'I would imagine he was embarrassed by the whole thing.'

The DeKalb District Attorney's office spokesman said the criminal case had yet to be presented to a grand jury. The case will be dismissed after prosecutors are formally notified of the death.

Castleberry
 also served as director of the gay Dixie Bowling League and a board 
member of the International Gay Bowling Organization, while Woodlief 
worked on pageants with Castleberry.

Scores of friends expressed their sadness at the loss on Facebook and shared photos of the grinning couple in happier times.

'This has been the longest and hardest day of my life,' Holt wrote.
