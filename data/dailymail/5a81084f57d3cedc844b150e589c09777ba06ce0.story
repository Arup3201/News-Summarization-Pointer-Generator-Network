The mother who was pictured crying in a mugshot after she left her kids in her car to attend a job interview has finally regained custody of the children.

Shanesha Taylor, 35, from Phoenix, Arizona, was granted custody of her three children at a hearing in a Maricopa County courtroom on Thursday.

The court previously agreed to dismiss the abuse charges against her as long as she completes parenting classes.

'I finally breathed,' Taylor told AZ Central after the hearing. 'I don't think I breathed for three days before that.'

Smiles: Taylor, pictured with her attorney, said she was looking forward to having ice cream with the kids

The single mother-of-three and Air Force veteran was barred from seeing the children after she was arrested on March 20 for leaving her two sons - aged six months and two years - alone in her car for 45 minutes while she went for an interview.

A witness found the baby crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV topped 100 degrees

According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool. 

The story made national headlines after Taylor's emotional mug shot emerged, and she revealed that she had acted out of desperation after the babysitter pulled out at the last minute.

'It was me knowing my family was in crisis and knowing that I had to make a choice between providing for my children or caring for my children,' she told Matt Lauer on the Today show earlier this summer.

As strangers donated more than $114,000 to pay her legal fees and other expenses, the story sparked a national debate about how much access single mothers or those in dire financial situations have to public assistance.

She was released from jail on March 31.

Her children were taken to hospital on the day of her arrest but were not found to have suffered any injuries. They were placed with family and Taylor was eventually allowed to see them under supervision.

After the court's decision on Thursday, she was allowed to collect her children and she said she planned on seeing them as soon as possible - and expected they'd be getting ice cream. 

Taylor said she is still looking for a job and hopes to land one in the service industry.
