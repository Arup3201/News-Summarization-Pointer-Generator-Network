Jonathan Dwyer was indicted late Friday on charges of assault in connection with two episodes of domestic violence against his wife, including one in which he broke her nose with a headbutt.

The Arizona Cardinals running back received one charge of felony aggravated assault and eight misdemeanor charges of assault, criminal damage and disorderly conduct, according to the indictment released late Friday.

The first episode between Dwyer and his wife, Kayla Tobin Dwyer, took place when she confronted him after learning of phone calls between him and another woman.

As she argued with him, Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress her, and when she refused, police say Dwyer headbutted her, breaking her nose.

A neighbor called the police after hearing the argument, but Dwyer hid in the shower while Kayla told officers she had not been assaulted.

Police later said that Dwyer had instructed to tell the police he was not in the home or he would kill himself in front of her kids.

The next day, Dwyer assaulted his wife again, punching her in the face, as well as hitting walls and throwing a shoe at their 17-month-old son.

As she tried to call police, Dwyer grabbed the phone out of her hands and threw it down on the ground.

Dwyer's wife left after the two assaults took place and did not reach out to police until Dwyer began texting her suicidal messages, including a photo of a knife.

Arrested: Dwyer was arrested September 17 on assault charges in connection with two altercations at his home in July involving his family

After Dwyer was arrested, he admitted in interviews with police that he hid in the shower, though he denied allegations of assaulting his wife. 

Dwyer has been ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and banned from having contact with his wife and son. 

The Cardinals put Dwyer on the reserve/non-football illness list, which prevents him from playing with Arizona for the rest of the season.

Sidelined: The Cardinals deactivated Jonathan Dwyer from all team activities following his arrest

This is as opposed to the exempt/commissioner’s permission list which the Minnesota Vikings used to deactivate Adrian Peterson during his trial for child abuse.

Reporter Kent Somers tweeted that the Cardinals will continue to pay Dwyer while he's on the non-football illness list.

The NFL said Dwyer's case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy.

The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues ever since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator.

Then Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. 

The Carolina Panthers put star defensive end Greg Hardy on the exempt list September 17 and said he will not play for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved.
