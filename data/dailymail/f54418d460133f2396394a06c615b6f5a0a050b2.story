A grandmother has written an open letter to a burglar who ransacked her home on the eve of her 18-year-old grandson's funeral.

Dorothy Iris Mayer, 79, was left heartbroken by the raid at her home which took place as she was preparing to bury her grandson Christopher Vaughan, 18, who drowned in a tragic accident.

She said she 'could have cried' when she came home from a hospital appointment to find thieves had broken into her home and taken jewellery including her wedding ring and her late husband's wedding ring.

However she decided to type an open letter to the thieves who ransacked her home in Fairwater, Cardiff, which police have now released in a bid to bring those responsible to justice.

The grandmother-of-four wrote: 'I would like to say thank you for robbing me in the daytime, (maybe saving me from having a beating) I was going to my 18-year-old grandson's funeral in Birmingham on Saturday as he drowned in Weymouth Harbour...

'Pity you didn’t wait one more day, you would have had the house to yourself. And maybe left it as you found it, clean and tidy, not like a tip.

'You obviously went with your muddy boots straight to the bedrooms where you left muddy prints all over my cream carpets. Even the goods you threw on the floor, you walked over without any concern.'

Later in the letter she writes: 'I do hope you make a mistake and get caught.'

Mrs Mayer said she wrote the letter to let whoever broke into her home know what she thought of them and their actions.

Mrs Mayer said she wrote the letter to let whoever broke into her home know what she thought of them and their actions.

She said: 'I didn’t want to turn up at the funeral crying about the robbery.

'I thought I’m going to sit there and write a letter to whoever it is and talk to him like a mother would.

'I wasn’t going to let him get to me, I just wanted to tell him what I thought of him and what he had done.

The break-in took place the day before the funeral of Mrs Mayer's 18-year-old grandson Christopher Vaughan

'I don’t mean any damage but there has got to be a reason and they’ve got to be stopped.

'People just can’t be robbed all the time. It’s not fair that we can’t leave our homes and be content and happy without worrying about locking this and locking that.

'It’s a horrible way to live, going around robbing people - that’s no life. My grandson would have made something of his life, not like these thieves.'

Mrs Mayer said she has had a lot of tragedy in her life but she would not let the criminal get to her.

She survived her home being bombed in 1944, an attack which left her mother dead and her sister seriously injured.

Her husband died four years ago after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer’s - which she described as a living hell - but she has never lost her love of life.

The mother-of-two, known among her friends for her 'wicked sense of humour', even wished the burglar well.

At the end of her letter she said: 'If it is stealing to pay for drugs you need help before it kills you.

'I would like to suggest you are made to go cold turkey and clean up your way of life.'

She released the letter and the pictures of the damage to her home and the empty jewellery boxes to the police after the theft on Friday.

Officers are now hunting for the thief.

Detective Constable Geraint Higgins said: 'This elderly victim has been left devastated by what has happened.

'Whoever was responsible mercilessly ransacked her home to look for something to steal. The victim has shown tremendous bravery and we are appealing for information that will help us make an arrest.

'People may have been offered a mobile phone, or they may have seen or found a purse discarded in the area.

'We’d like to speak to anybody who may have noticed somebody acting suspiciously, especially along the footpath behind her home.'
