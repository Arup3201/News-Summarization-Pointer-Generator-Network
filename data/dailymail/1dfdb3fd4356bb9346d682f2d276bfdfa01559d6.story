A 47-year-old man accused of dousing his girlfriend's puppy with hot sauce while it was having a seizure has been charged with animal cruelty.

Ephrian Myles allegedly drenched three-month-old Gizmo with the spicy condiment about 1.20am yesterday because he was annoyed that the dog was having a seizure and yelping in pain.

After the sauce got into his eyes and mouth, the dachshund-Chihuahua mix struggled to breathe, its eyes were swollen shut and its body became limp.

Charged: Ephrian Myles, 47, allegedly doued his girlfriend's three-month-old puppy Gizmo with hot sauce

Bay News 9 reported that Myles's frantic girlfriend, Gizmo's owner, took her pooch to a local fire station in Sarasota, Florida for help.

Officers Jessica Sullivan and Adam Arena washed Gizmo with water and a towel, according to The Tampa Tribune, and the dog was turned over to Animal Services.

Gizmo is expected to recover.

Investigating officers who went to the woman's house on the 3500 block of Old Bradenton Road said they saw a pool of hot sauce on the floor.

Myles denied having anything to do with the attack before he was arrested.

The Sarasota man has been charged with felony aggravated animal cruelty and taken to Sarasota County Jail. He is being held on $5,000 bond.
