A 23-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly killing his girlfriend's two-year-old son by jumping up and down on his chest, shaking him and slamming his head into a window sill.

Mirsad Hamidovic reportedly attacked the toddler, named Lorenzo, at an apartment complex in Kansas City, Missouri, in the early hours of Friday morning while the child's mother was at work.

He repeatedly jumped on the youngster's chest 'with his forearms in front of him', crushing him, possibly knocking his head into a window sill and causing him to vomit blood, police said.

As Lorenzo  lost consciousness, Hamidovic then allegedly violently shook him to wake him up.

Following the alleged assault, Lorenzo was rushed to hospital with serious head and brain injuries, including bruising on his brain,  court documents state. He was also suffering from a lacerated liver.

The boy was placed on life support. But despite medics' best efforts, he passed away on Sunday.

While Lorenzo was dying in hospital, Hamidovic was arrested and charged with two counts of felony child abuse and two counts of first-degree domestic assault, according to KCTV 5. 

These charges will likely be upgraded now that the boy has died.

Scene: In an interview with police, Hamidovic apparently admitted to jumping on Lorenzo's chest at least twice as the boy lay on his back on a bed at the apartment on the 1700 block of Washington Avenue (pictured)

In an interview with police, Hamidovic apparently admitted to jumping on Lorenzo's chest at least twice as the boy lay on his back on a bed, with his head partially on a window sill, at around 3am.

'The suspect jumped up in the air and came down on the victim's chest and the victim's head may have hit the window sill,' according to court documents obtained by the news station.

'The suspect said the victim was on his back on the ground when the suspect jumped off the bed up in the air and came down on the victim's chest with his forearms in front of him.

'He did this twice. The suspect stated the victim was coughing up blood and he cleaned the blood off the victim's mouth in a panic.' 

The toddler then fell unconscious, it is reported.

When Lorenzo failed to wake up, Hamidovic allegedly started violently shaking the toddler, causing his head and arms to flail around, before placing him under a cold shower.  

In a panic, he then ran down the hallway at the Nottingham Apartments, situated on the 1700 block of Washington Avenue, shouting for help, with Lorenzo lying limp in his arms.

Several neighbors tried desperately to resuscitate the toddler before paramedics arrived. It is not clear whether Hamidovic, or one of his neighbors, dialed 911.

Resident Gena Gutierrez, who performed CPR on Lorenzo, said: 'The baby was stone cold, turning blue. I put him on the ground and he wasn't breathing, so I started breathing into him.' 

She added: 'It breaks my heart. God knows I tried to do what I could. I feel real sorry for the mom.'

Hamidovic, who has three biological children that he often sees, is being held on a cash-only $500,000 bond, according to KSHB. He is due to appear in court on January 28.

His relationship with Lorenzo remains unclear.
