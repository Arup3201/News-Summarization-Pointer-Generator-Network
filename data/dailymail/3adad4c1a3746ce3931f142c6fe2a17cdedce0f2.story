Joining the Mile High club has long been a fantasy for some but for most, the risks outweigh any reward.

However now a Californian company has given people a halfway house of sorts - with a bed fashioned out of the engine of a Boeing 747.

MotoArt, which specialises in making furniture out of vintage plane parts, has fashioned the bed out of the 747 Sleeper - and it can be yours for $20,000.

The bed is made out of parts of a 747 engine and will cost a minimum of £20,000 to buy

The king size bed has been fitted with padded leather head and footboards and adjustable lighting

It has been created by Californian company MotoArt, who says it will create a 'luxurious cloud 9 experience'

The bed is a king size mattress set between two halves of one of the plane's nacelle - the circular piece of casing on the front of the engine.

While the price has not yet been officially set, it will set buyers back at least $20,000 (£12,038),

Dave Hall, MotoArt's Managing Director, said: 'This is designed to create the hottest 
and most luxurious cloud 9 experience on the planet. 70,000 pounds of 
thrust just ended up in your bedroom.'

He said the bed, which comes with padded leather head and footboards and programmable lighting is built to 'withstand the hardest landings.'

Managing Director Dave Hall said: 'This is designed to create the hottest and most luxurious cloud 9 experience on the planet. 70,000 pounds of thrust just ended up in your bedroom.

The engines themselves are an impressive feat of engineering, four are attached to a jet and, with each able to output 70,000lbs of force on takeoff, they are able to lift nearly 450 tonnes off the ground.

MotoArt have a large range of similar items, including desks made out of wing flaps, benches made of out fuselage and bookshelves made out of rudders from planes used in the Korean War.

The bed is made by cutting the nacelle of an engine in half and fitting a mattress in between
