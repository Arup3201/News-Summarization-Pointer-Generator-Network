Kendall Jenner looks like a total knockout in her colorful new video campaign for Estee Lauder, which introduces the iconic beauty brand's new collaboration with the French fashion house Courrèges, and shows the model playfully taking a swing at the camera.

The 19-year-old, who was named as the face of Estee Lauder last November, can be seen modeling bright pink lip gloss and silver eyeliner from the 12-piece limited edition collection in the clip, which debuted on Monday.

Kendall proudly shared a photo of herself donning a shocking pink patent leather jacket and an orange visor today on Instagram, and within three hours the snapshot received nearly 450,000 likes and more than 10,000 comments.
