Cringe-inducing subtitling errors could soon be a thing of the past, as broadcasting watchdog Ofcom have launched a quality crackdown.Â 

The BBC reported that the move follows complaints by viewers about the accuracy and reliability of the service, which is often used by viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Ofcom is now demanding that broadcasters monitor the quality of subtitles, which are used by more than a million people, every six months for two years.

According to the BBC, some complainants have said that although the pre-prepared subtitling is generally of good quality, live subtitling is often poor with errors sneaking in.

Ofcom's Claudio Pollack told the BBC: 'Ofcom expects regular reporting by broadcasters to help improve subtitles over time, as well as allowing us to identify exactly which areas need most progress.'

Seventy channels in the UK now provide a subtitling service, and a consultation which started in May suggested that problems began when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitles to be prepared in advance.

Ofcom will publish a report based on its findings in spring 2014, and use the evidence to decide is changes to the current guidelines are needed.

The BBC reported that the watchdog has also asked broadcasters to consider adding a time delay to live programming that is not time-sensitive, so that the quality of subtitling can be improved.

Wrong: This Morning's staff had to apologise after viewers using the subtitles service saw this typo

A BBC announcer reporting 'a moment of silence for the Queen Mother' had his words transcribed as 'a moment of violence.'

In another TV gaffe the sale of 'millions of puppies' confused subtitle users in a news piece about the Poppy Appeal for Remembrance Day.

A roving reporter on BBC Breakfast became
an internet sensation, when he was subtitled wrongly as saying that the
pigs he was with 'love to nibble anything that comes into the shed, 
like our willies.'

The leader of the Labour Party has also not escaped the subtitling error - being referred to as 'Ed Miller Band' on one occasion.

Former chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson became 'Silly and Admundsen' while the National Union of Students was renamed the National Union of Stew Departments.

The Morning also suffered a toe-curling gaffe with its sub-title service after it accidentally confused the word 'rate' for 'rape' during a fashion segment.

Live football commentary is also subtitled which has resulted in Poland being called Holland and former Liverpool keeper Jerzey Dudek becoming 'Dudeback.'

But these kinds of errors are not just confined to the UK. Browne University in the US apologised after accidentally mis-subtitling the Dalai Lama.

Their subtitle team quoted the holy man as saying 'f**k it' at the end of a speech on world peace.
