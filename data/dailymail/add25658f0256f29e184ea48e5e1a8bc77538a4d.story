Kim, 25, turned out looking the picture of elegance to support him in a green Victoria by Victoria Beckham dress.

The stunning artist came up top in 
the battle of the Wimbledon blondes, setting the tone for the day's 
tense match between Murray and Djokovic.

Her mint laser cut lace dress, which comes up just above the knee, is worth a reported £925 and is already sold out everywhere.

She accessorised it with her trusted nude Mulberry tote and beige woven platform sandals.

Holding her sunglasses and mobile phone 
in her hand, Sears strode confidently toward Centre Court to take her 
seat for Murray's final match against Novak Djokovic of Serbia.

Djokovic's girlfriend Jelena Ristic also looked in good spirits and opted for a less sophisticated outfit.

She wore a sporty tulip dress with indigo, cream, fuschia and black stripes and piping.

The model also chose nude accessories in the form of a quilted chain strap bag and T strap platform sandals. She was all smiles holding two water bottles and wearing her sunglasses.

While their partners slug it out,

Murray, the British number one, kicked off the match on top form taking the first set 6-4.

As Murray is successful in his life-long dream to win Wimbledon, he is now the first Briton to win the Men’s Singles in 77 years.

Kim was at the forefront of the supporters in the players' box at All England Club's most famous court, while a tense-looking Judy Murray - the Scot's mother - was also courtside for the clash.

Prime Minister David Cameron, Hollywood heart-throb Bradley Cooper, and footballer Wayne Rooney also arrived to watch the Scot on Centre Court today as he takes on Djokovic.

It will be tough conditions for both Murray and Djokovic out on centre court as temperatures are set to soar to 30C (86F) in west London. The head court groundsman Neil Stubley suggested that the temperatures out on the court had topped 40C.

So far during this tournament Kim has
 worn outfits from Ted Baker, Whistles and Zara - all of which have 
experienced a subsequent surge in demand.

A Zara floral dress Kim wore on Monday sold out almost instantaneously. Sales of a £25 ASOS dress Jelena has worn courtside have also rallied afterwards.

Jelena, 27, insists the rivalry remains friendly and both couples get on well.

She said: ‘Kim and Andy are really nice and there is no negative energy between Novak and Andy. They are gentlemen.’
