Another woman has come forward with allegations of rape against comedian Bill Cosby, claiming that she was one of more than a dozen women to testify against him as part of a civil lawsuit in 2005.

Donna Motsinger, 73, broke her silence in an interview with New York Post's Page Six Tuesday, revealing that she was known as Jane Doe No 8 in the lawsuit filed by former Temple University athletics director Andrea Constand.

The married mother of three from Taos, New Mexico, said that she decided to speak out more than four decades later because she felt like 'coward' after staying silent for some many years.

End of story: Constand reached a private settlement with the married comedian in 2006

Motsinger said that the former star of The Cosby Show drugged and raped her in 1971 when she worked as a waitress at a jazz club in Sausalito, California.

Bill Cosby married his wife, Camille, in 1964. The couple have five children.   

'I feel guilty not telling my story,' Motsinger told The Post. 'I’m a coward over here. Those women are brave.

'It’s the least I can do. I want to tell people so [the victims] can’t be bullied, so they can’t be discredited.'

On Tuesday, Mrs Motsinger, who lost her 33-year-old son, Dylan, in 2012, took to her Facebook page to offer more details on what made her come forward after all these years.

'My mother has known as has family and a few friends but it's something that I just didn't think I could be honest about with the world,' she wrote. 

'If my son Dylan were still with me today he would tell me "Mom, you have always taught us to be honest and stand up for our truth, it's only right you speak up now.."

Wife and mother: Motsinger has been married for more than 30 years and had three sons 

'Also my mother is very ill and I didn't want to do anything to bring her more discomfort but today she gave me her blessing to tell my story,' Motsinger stated.

'I wrote Mr. Cosby's attorney and asked him to please just have his client not demean the brave women who have come forward...but as you might expect they are determined to make these women out to be seeking money and or fame...

'I cannot sit back and just be quiet..be a coward..I want nothing from this man in any way. I want to be a friend to those who had the courage I didn't have...until now.'

Andrea Constand, the former head of operations for the Temple University women's basketball team, filed a civil lawsuit in 2005 accusing Cosby of drugging and raping her in his Philadelphia-area mansion in 2004. 

Under fire: More than a dozen women have come forward in recent weeks with allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted them decades earlier 

Thirteen women, among them Donna Motsinger, agreed to appear as witnesses in the case. Constand reached a private settlement with Mr Cosby in 2006.

More than a dozen women have come forward in recent weeks with allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted decades ago, and in some cases, drugged them.

Therese Serignese, a Florida woman, said Cosby assaulted her in 1976. Model Janice Dickinson, the most high-profile accuser, alleged in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that Cosby had sexually assaulted her in 1982. 

His attorney, Martin Singer, has called the growing number of sexual assault allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited' and accused the media of vilifying the actor and comedian once known as "America's dad" for his role as a loving patriarch on the hit sitcom The Cosby Show. 

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel  (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.

Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee.

Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992.

Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship.

Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. 

Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner.

Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties.

Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, "No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''.

Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault.

Lachele Covington: The 20-year-old actress, who’d been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed.
