A surrogate father who spent ten years in jail for shaking his baby son to death has been freed after new evidence revealed the boy died of poor health.

Drayton Witt, who was convicted in 2002 of second-degree murder in the death of his four-month-old son Steven.

But this week, an Arizona Superior Court judge dismissed all charges against Mr Witt and he is now reunited with his wife, Maria.

Free: Drayton Witt stands with his wife Maria Witt. He was convicted in 2002 for second degree murder but an Arizona judge has dismissed the charges

The 31-year-old was not Steven's biological father, but helped Maria raise him and had given the child his last name, according to Slate.

Mr Witt said Wednesday that he was overcome with joy knowing the case was finally closed for good.

'I can start my life over again,' he told the Arizona Republic.

Steven was born a 'blue baby' with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.

Court records showed that Steven had suffered from severe health problems and had been in and out of the hospital during his short life span. Steven died of a major seizure, which stopped his heart.

Police and hospital officials originally decided upon Steven's death in 2000 that the infant's eye and brain injuries were caused by violent shaking and the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.

Since Mr Witt was the last person to be with his son, he was held responsible and later convicted of murder in a dramatic trial where prosecutors likened his actions to those of a gorilla.

After spending ten years behind bars Mr Witt was released from prison in May after a judge set aside his 2002 murder conviction.

A local nonprofit organization, the Arizona Justice Project, filed a motion in February stating that scientific evidence no longer supported the conclusion that Mr Witt shook his son to death.

An autopsy photo showed an obstructed vein leading to Steven's brain - an important detail the medical examiner did not include in his 2000 report ruling the death a homicide by shaking.

The medical examiner, in a sworn statement given in February, said that if he were to testify in court again, he would conclude that the baby had died of disease, not physical abuse.

Last week, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office filed a motion to drop the case, stating its 'expert' could not testify as to the original theory about the case and the Arizona Superior Court judge, Robert Gottsfield, dismissed the charges with prejudice.

That ensures Mr Witt will never go back to jail for his son's death and prosecutors will not be allowed to retry him.

Christina Rubalcava, an attorney for Witt, told the Arizona Republic that if the charges had only been dropped, Witt would have faced the risk of them being brought up again, since murder charges have no statute of limitations.

'We wanted to push forward and not have him and (his wife) Maria deal with that for the rest of their lives,' Rubalcava said on Wednesday.

This is the second time Maricopa County prosecutors were proven wrong in a shaken baby syndrome homicide case. In 2011, the 1998 murder conviction of Armando Castillo for the death of his girlfriend's child was overturned, according to the Phoenix New Times.
