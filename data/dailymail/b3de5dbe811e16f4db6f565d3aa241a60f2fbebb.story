Syria's prime minister escaped an 
assassination attempt today when a bomb went off near his convoy in the 
capital, Damascus, state-run TV said.

Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi was unhurt in the bombing in the capital's western neighborhood of Mazzeh, state TV said.

The blast killed al-Halqi's bodyguard and one of his driver's is in a critical condition.

The TV showed footage of heavily damaged cars and debris in the area of the blast as firefighters fought to extinguish a large blaze caused by the explosion.

Target: Syria's prime minister escaped an assassination attempt today when a bomb went off near his convoy in the capital, Damascus, state-run TV said

Violence: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights watchdog reported that a car bomb targeted Halqi's convoy, killing one of his bodyguards

Blast: The wreckage of a car is seen in the middle of the road following the fatal blast

Injured: According to reports Halqi's driver and a second bodyguard were also seriously wounded in the explosion

Target: Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi was unhurt in the attack

The daring attack in the upscale 
neighborhood, which is home to many embassies and officials, was another
blow to the government, exposing its vulnerability in the very seat of 
Assad's powerbase.

A Syrian government official said 
that an improvised explosive device was placed under a car that was 
parked in the area and was detonated as al-Halqi's car drove by.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

The state-run Al-Ikhbariya station 
said al-Halqi went into a regular weekly meeting with an economic 
committee straight after the bombing and showed him sitting around a 
table in a room with several other officials.

The channel said it was showing the video as a proof that al-Halqi was not hurt.

But the prime minister's comments 
after the meeting did not refer to today's blast and he was not asked 
about it by reporters, leaving doubts as to whether the footage was 
filmed before or after the bombing.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory 
for Human Rights said the blast killed al-Halqi's bodyguard and that one
of his drivers was in critical condition.

The group relies on a network of activist around the country.

Clear out: Damaged vehicles are towed away as emergency crews clear the area

Today's bombing also showed that 
anti-government elements in Syria are becoming increasingly brazen, 
striking in a highly secure Damascus neighborhood, only about 100 meters
(yards) from the residence of the Swiss ambassador.

Mazzeh is also home to a major military air base and top officials live in the posh district.

The attack was not the first targeting a high official in the Syrian capital over the past year.

On July 18, a blast at the Syrian 
national security building in Damascus during a meeting of Cabinet 
ministers killed the defense minister and his deputy, who was President 
Bashar Assad's brother-in-law.

That attack also wounded the interior minister.

In December, a car bomb targeted the 
Interior Ministry in Damascus, killing several people and wounding more 
than 20, including Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar.

Initially, Syrian state media said al-Shaar was not hurt in the Dec. 12 blast.

News of his injuries emerged a week later, after he was brought to neighboring Lebanon for treatment of a serious back injury.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attack.

Massive bombings like the one that 
struck the prime minister's convoy have been a trademark of Islamic 
radicals fighting alongside the Syrian rebels, raising concerns about 
the extremists' role in Syria's civil war.

Al-Halqi, a senior member of Assad's 
ruling Baath party, took office last year after his predecessor, Riad 
Hijab, defected to Jordan.

Al-Halqi was Syria's health minister 
before taking the post. He is a member of Assad's ruling Baath party and
hails from the southern city of Daraa, the birthplace of the Syrian 
uprising.
