As fans of political thriller 'House of Cards' settled in to watch season two's premiere tonight, real-life politicians were rehearsing their lines. 

Now This News recruited members of Congress to deliver lines originally spoken by power-hungry character Francis J. Underwood, played by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, in the hit Netflix series.

But if you thought chilling comments uttered by a malicious - but fictional - character were unsettling, just wait until you hear them repeated by people with real power.

Brutal: Kevin Spacey plays the cut-throat politician Frank Underwood in hit Netflix series 'House of Cards'

The popular program charts the Democratic congressman and House Majority Whip's highly intricate plan to disgrace his enemies and obtain a cabinet position after the President goes back on his promise to appoint him Secretary of State.

Underwood's vengeful plotting and deep-rooted corruption has attracted the ire of some politicians - and the adoration of others. 

This News producer Ashley Codianni targeted six political representatives - three Democrat and three Republican - who are fans of the show to deliver some of Underwood's most memorable quotes.

But, she told USA Today, it wasn't easy: 'It was particularly difficult to get members to participate.'

Majority Whip, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), opens the clip with the poignant: 'I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn.'

Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-SC) means business when he says, 'I have no patience for useless things,' while Trey Gowdy (D-SC) gets into character with a sharp, 'I have zero tolerance for betrayal.'

Cold-hearted: Rep Jeff Duncan (R-SC) nails Underwood's comment to his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, 'That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time'

Majority Whip: Just like Underwood, who speaks directly to the camera, Rep Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) puts his call on hold to say, 'I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn'

The lines get increasingly chilling, including Donna Edwards' (D-Md.) deadpan, 'Power is a lot like real estate. Location, location, location.'

Repeating a line Underwood originally directed to his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, politician Jeff Duncan (R-SC) quotes: 'That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time.'

And to end, Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) repeats this doozy, initially directed to White House chief of staff Linda Vasquez: 'The nature of promises, Linda, is that they are immune, IMMUNE, to changing circumstances.'

The plot: 'House of Cards' documents Frank Underwood's fury at being betrayed by President Garrett Walker and how, with his equally malicious wife, Claire, seek to exact revenge and ultimately gain power

Direct: Adopting the typical Underwood stance, Rep Trey Gowdy (D-SC) declares, 'I have zero tolerance for betrayal'

Participating: Channeling Democrat representative Frank Underwood, real-life Democrats Jim Clyburn (left) and Donna Edwards (right) repeated some of his killer lines with aplomb

Meanwhile, Spacey said he's heard from politicians that his portrayal of Underwood is relatively accurate.

'I've had politicians say it's very accurate, probably closer to the truth. I've had others say it's cynical and unrealistic. It depends on your perspective,' he told USA Today.

'I was surprised that Kevin McCarthy said publicly something he said to me privately: 'If I could just kill one member of Congress, I'd never have to worry about another vote'.'
