Australia's top female criminal prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, has told a court corruption body ICAC has no business investigating her private life.

Ms Cunneen launched an urgent action in the NSW Supreme Court this morning against the Independent Commission Against Corruption claims, which claims she perverted the course of justice and instructed her son's girlfriend, 25-year-old Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to beat a drink driving test in May this year.

Ms Cunneen, who is a familiar figure in Sydney courts on the bench prosecuting gang rapists and murderers, is the principal plaintiff in today's court action along with her son, Stephen Wyllie, 26 and his 25-year-old girlfriend, Sophia Tilley.

Ms Cunneen did not show up personally, however her counsel Arthur Moses, QC, argued that just because she holds public office doesn't mean she loses ' the rights of any other citizen when a matter arises in their personal life which has nothing to do with their public function'.

He said neither Ms Cunneen nor any other public official including 'dog catchers and rangers' should lose their rights as private citizens.

 He said Ms Cunnen's role as deputy senior crown prosecutor was 'irrelevant' in the case of the car crash investigation.

'You have a state body making a decision impacting on the rights of citizens,' he said.

Seeking documents: Margaret Cunneen, SC, will be on the other side of the court room today when she seeks documents tracing the origin of the 'malicious complaint' which may have landed her before ICAC

Since the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) launched action against Ms Cunneen last week, the widely respected NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor has received a groundswell of support from senior figures in the Australian legal fraternity.

 The ICAC hearing to investigate allegations of perverting the course of justice against Ms Cunneen is due to begin next Monday.

The action, which has been described as a 'witch hunt',  could 'only be the result of a malicious complaint', the 55-year-old mother of three sons told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Cunneen launched her Supreme Court action on Tuesday to challenge the ICAC's power to investigate the claim, and to seek documents and a copy of the 'allegation or complaint' which set off the Commission's investigation into Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley. 

Mr Moses asked Justice Clifton Hoeben to eject ICAC from an active presence in the court proceedings, arguing it 'endangers the impartiality' of the Commission to rule in the looming hearing against Ms Cunneen.

'If the Commission becomes the protagonist it endangers their impartiality in subsequent hearings,' Mr Moses said.

He said Ms Cunneen and her fellow applicants were demanding ICAC's reasons for mounting the investigation in the first place.

'They don't have any get out of jail free card,' he said, 'they are accountable like anybody else.'

But counsel for ICAC, Mr Kirk, said the Commission would resist explaining in court as to why the charges of perverting the course of justice had been laid.

Mr Moses is seeking an order restraining the ICAC from taking further steps in relation to the investigation, the reasons why the action was taken, and a declaration that the commission is acting outside its jurisdiction.

The car crash at the centre of the ICAC claims happened on May 31, when Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time.

Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured.

 The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system.

Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident.

Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash, which happened in May. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August.

Since ICAC Launched its action, there has been an outcry from legal figures including former NSW State cabinet head, Professor Gary Sturgess, that the matter should have been investigated by police.

Justice Hoeben has previously ruled against Margaret Cunneen, in 2007 when she was prosecuting in the retrial of convicted gang rapist Bilal Skaf.

One of three judges on the Court of Criminal Appeal, Justice Hoeben ruled Ms Cunneen should not participate in the retrial because she had made public  statements about the case of Skaf and his fellow gang rapists which would compromise 'appropriate fairness and detachment'.

In a separate action, the acting Inspector of the ICAC, prominent former Supreme Court judge David Levine, QC, announced he was conducting an audit into the Commission's action against Ms Cunneen.
