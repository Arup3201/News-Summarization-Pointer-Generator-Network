Finding a new flatmate is often a challenge, but for one Swedish teenager only men as 'good looking as hell' will do.

Alicia Hansson had also demanded that potential cohabitors were 'charming' and knew how to put a toilet seat down, in her advert on the flat-hunting Facebook group page in Gothenburg last week.

Her brutally honest approach has attracted abuse online by those who have accused her of objectifying men. But it has also seen the teen flooded with offers from attractive men who believe they fit the profile.

Alicia Hansson was hit with a barrage of online abuse after she advertised for 'good looking as hell' flatmate

The 19 year-old decided to take the unusual approach as a 'cry for help searching for that non-existant, ideal man,' she told the Gothenburg Post.

Ms Hansson, who wrote the post while preparing to return to Sweden - where flat sharing is a rarity - after working as an au pair in Spain. 

'Are you good looking as hell, charming and know how to put down the toilet seat after you?,' she asked.

'Searching high and low for a prospective room mate/partner to move in with some time after the summer. Love is absolutely no obligation!' 

Within days Ms Hansson had well over 1,000 responses to the advert, with some men even sending her romantic poems or half naked pictures

Ms Hansson said she had 'lost count' of how many messages she had received but believed there had been well over 1,000 responses to the advert, with some men sending half naked pictures and others sending romantic poems.

Other found the advert amusing with Siya Mhlwatika commenting that the teenager was a 'hilarious lady this!'

But the post was not a hit with everyone, after some accused the pretty teen of objectifying men.

One post simply described the stunt as 'white trash' while Jonas Bengtsson, another member of the same apartment rental group on Facebook, asked: 'Is this some kind of social experiment?'

Ms Hansson had appealed for good-looking men who were 'charming' and knew how to put the toilet seat down after use

Ms Hansson told MailOnline: 'I've lost count on how many messages I've received, and am still receiving, and how many wonderful, handsome and charming men there are out there searching for company.

'I wish them all the best to find what they're looking for- I'm sure they will.

'For the rest, I pray for the ones who are constantly trying to make other people feel less worse, and hope that they see how much bigger of a problem their actions are for society.  

'I thought it was quite clear I wasn't trying to outrage anyone. 

'My ad was simply just about finding someone to settle down with, being willing to make him feel as a king while he's seducing my eyesight. I don’t really see the sexist statements described.

'And for people searching for love, be no-one but yourself and don't let other people choose what you want in life. Go get what's out there and never sell yourself short- no matter if it's the man of your life or somewhere to live.' 

Single Ms Hansson said that she had now found her perfect man who measured up to her tough criteria.

'We'll both see what happens,' she added. Who knows, maybe the ad wasn't so "stupid" after all and... I must say he's one good-looker.'
