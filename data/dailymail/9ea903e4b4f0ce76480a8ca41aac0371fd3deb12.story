It is one of the rarest achievements in golfing, eluding even the best professionals in the game.

But amateurs Bob Wood, 75, and Jeff Roberts 60, defied estimated odds of a million-to-one to hit consecutive holes-in-one on the same hole just seconds apart.

The pensioners had been competing against two other players in a 'fourball' match when they both 'aced' the par three 17th hole at Queens Park Golf Club, Bournemouth, Dorset.

Lucky: The green was raised so the pair did not know how close the balls had gotten to the hole

Ladbrokes say that the chances of hitting the two shots on the same hole are a million-to-one.

Bob, a retired property speculator, was first to tee off and struck his ball with a nine wood club towards the flag 157 yards away but because the green is elevated, the pair couldn't see how his ball ended up.

Jeff then struck an eight-iron straight at the flag and the pair marched up hill towards the hole after the other two players had hit their shots.

Their surprise that only two of the four balls were on or near the green soon turned to astonishment when they looked in the hole and found their two balls sunk in it.

The pair slapped each other on the back before finishing and winning their game.

They
then adhered to the golfing tradition of buying a round of drinks in 
the bar, although their stunning achievement meant they halved the bill.

Bob, who has a handicap of 16, said: 'I hit my tee shot first and one of the guys said "oh, that could be quite close."

Partners in crime: Bob and Jeff were lucky to do it together as traditionally a golfer who scores a hole-in-one must buy the members of the club a round of drinks

'Jeff went straight after me and the same chap said "...and that's even closer."

'One of the guys on the 18th tee which is right next to the green then came into view with his arms waving and shouting it was a hole-in-one but we didn't know which one.'

Jeff, a semi-retired roofing contractor, said: 'We walked up to the green and saw two balls on it. I thought my ball had gone over the back because I couldn't see it.

'One of our opponents then walked up to the flag and said there were two balls in the hole.

Firm friends: Bob and Jeff were playing a 'fourball' match at Queens Park Golf Club, Bournemouth

'We were gobsmacked. To get two holes-in-one in consecutive shots on the same hole must be a million-to-one chance.'

Jeff, who has a handicap of six, added: 'In amateur golf it is tradition to buy a round of drinks in the clubhouse when you get a hole-in-one and there were 14 of us there, but luckily Bob and I shared the bill.'

Another pensioner also managed to beat the odds when he scored two holes-in-one in a row in 2010.

Peter Wafford, 75, sunk the pair of par-three holes-in-one during a veterans match at Chigwell Golf Club, in Chigwell, Essex,

His feat also followed that of five-year-old Eleanor Gamble, who became one of the youngest girls in the world to sink a hole-in-one at Cambridge Lakes golf course on April 15 of the same year.

As is tradition, the pair bought everyone a round in the bar... but luckily they could split the bill
