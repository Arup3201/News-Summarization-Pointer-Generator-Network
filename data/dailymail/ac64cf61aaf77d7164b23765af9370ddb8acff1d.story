A police chief who was just a fortnight away from retirement was shot dead and four more officers were injured as a gunman opened fire during a drugs bust.

Chief Michael Maloney, 48, was killed as officers attempted to serve a search warrant in Greenland, New Hampshire last night.

Today the gunman remained holed up inside the property with a woman, police said.

Shot dead: Chief Michael Maloney, 48, he was killed as he executed a search warrant in Greenland last night - less than two weeks before his retirement

Streets in the area had been cordoned off as a stand-off ensued.

Two officers were also shot in the chest, another was hit in the arm and a fourth was hit in the shoulder.

The alleged gunman inside the property was named as Cullen Mutrie, who has previously been indicted on drugs charges, Fox News reported.

The killing of Chief Michael Maloney, who has worked as a police officer for the last 26 years, has devastated Greenland, a town of just 3,500 people.

'In those final days, he sacrificed his life in public service as a law enforcement officer in New Hampshire,' Attorney General Michael Delaney said today.

The officer had spent the last 12 years as chief of the Greenland department.

John Penacho, chairman of the town's Board of Selectman, said Maloney was married with children.

'It's a blow to all of us. You're stunned. It's New Hampshire, it's a small town,' he said. 'We're stunned. I mean all of us. It's an unbelievable situation.'

Jacqueline DeFreze, who lives half a mile down the road from the house where the shooting happened, said she was devastated to hear the chief had been shot.

'I'm a wreck. He was just the greatest guy,' said Ms DeFreze, a fourth-grade teacher in nearby Rye. 'He's kind-hearted, always visible in the community.'

Governor John Lynch was at Portsmouth Regional Hospital, where the officers were taken. He asked residents to pray for the injured officers and Maloney's family.

'My thoughts and prayers and those of my wife, Susan, are with the family of Chief Michael Maloney. Chief Maloney's unwavering courage and commitment to protecting others serves as an example to us all,' he said.

Stand-off: More police officers arrive on the scene in Greenland last night after the police chief and four officers were shot

Killing: The shootings happened in a two-bedroom property on a tree-lined street in Greenland. It has been cordoned off at both ends

The tree-lined street where the shooting happened features single-family homes and duplexes.

The shootings happened at a two-bedroom single storey property.

Steroids were allegedly found in the property when officers went to confiscate guns after Mutrie was arrested on domestic assault charges in July 2010.

The town's schools will be closed today, because law enforcement officers are using the elementary school as a staging area.

Asked what the town will do to help residents cope with the tragedy, Penacho said 'We'll do whatever we need to do.'

The other officers shot were Detective Gregory Turner, 32, from the Dover police department, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the shoulder and later released.

Detective Eric Kulberg, 31, from the University of New Hampshire police department, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and released.

Detective Scott Kukesh, 33, from the Newmarket police department, who was in intensive care awaiting surgery for a gunshot wound to the chest.

Finally Detective Jeremiah Murphy, 34, from the Rochester police department, was also in intensive care after undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to the chest.
