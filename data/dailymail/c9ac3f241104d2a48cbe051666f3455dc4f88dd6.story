Tragedy: Sylvia Page, 86, was being helped from her bed when she stumbled and banged her head against a wall, an inquest heard

A great grandmother died when she fell over and hit her head on a wall after an unsupervised student nurse tried to help her out of her hospital bed, an inquest heard.

Sylvia Page, 86,  died in June last year, 11 days after being admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex.  

A student nurse was trying to move  from her from a bed to the toilet when Mrs Page stumbled and was injured.

Her family, who have been awarded five-figure compensation by the NHS Trust, have criticised poor staff training at the hospital. 

The inquest into Mrs Page's death heard no risk assessment was carried out and the trainee nurse worker was unsupervised when she fell.

Mrs Page's son Michael, 62, said he had 'little faith' that things would improve and said his mother's death was a result of 'poor training and inadequate procedures'.

He said: 'My brother and I, and our families, are devastated by the loss of our mother, and the circumstances in which she died.

'We believe her death was a direct result of poor training and inadequate procedures.

'We did receive a letter of apology from the hospital but it's of little consolation. They have promised to implement procedures to ensure it doesn't happen again.

'However, I have little faith that things will improve. I hope I'm wrong as I would hate for anyone to go through a similar experience as us.'

An inquest in Chelmsford, Essex in March heard how Mrs Page was admitted to hospital after a fall and treated on the Lister ward for head injuries.

She was fatally injured when a student nurse attempted to move her to a commode.

The health worker held her hands in a bid to keep her steady but Mrs Page fell and hit her head on a wall and she died two days later from bleeding on the brain.

Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said the hospital failed to carry out the risk assessment required when moving a frail patient to a new environment.

She added that the student nurse had used poor technique and been inadequately supervised and monitored.

The coroner concluded: 'There were failings in the care provided by Princess Alexandra Hospital.'

Criticism: Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow, Essex, failed to properly care for Mrs Page when it allowed a student nurse to help her out of bed unsupervised

The family's solicitor David Kerry said: 'This sad case is yet another example of the poor and inadequate care that is too often provided to the elderly by the NHS.

'Increasingly, we are seeing cases where elderly patients have suffered falls whilst in hospital and, as a consequence, suffer serious injury that sometimes results in their death.

'These should be largely preventable in this day and age.

'It's nothing short of a national disgrace that the elderly, many of whom have made a massive contribution to this country, are subjected to such poor treatment in their later lives.

'The NHS simply does not provide sufficient care or compassion. At a basic level, training can be inadequate and supervision of front-line staff non-existent.

'Sylvia Page's family were devastated at her loss. Her two sons, grandchildren and great grandchildren will remember her for her love of life and independence.

'It makes it all the more sad that when she needed to depend on others, she was so badly let down.'

A spokeswoman for The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust said: 'We have apologised to the family for the identified failings in the care provided to Mrs Page, which fell short of the standard of care that patients can reasonably expect to receive.

'Following this incident a thorough review was undertaken and a comprehensive action plan put in place, to ensure that such failings will not occur in the future.'
