Acclaimed eco-chef, and food waste activist Tom Hunt is to host an alternative Christmas Feast at London's Borough Market in December to highlight the problem of food waste during the festive season.

The author of The Natural Cook's Feast of Seven Fishes will be created using surplus ingredients that would otherwise have been thrown away for no good reason. 

This includes wonky vegetables and blemished fruits as well as foraged fresh produce from market traders and fish caught using sustainable fishing methods from recommended healthy stocks.

Eco chef and food waste activist Tom Hunt will host an alternative Christmas banquet Feast of Seven Fishes on 14 December at Borough Market, London

The banquet, which is a traditional Italian meal usually served on Christmas Eve, will feature dishes like foraged salad of water-celery leaf, chervil and chickweed, and forgotten fish stew of pollock, coley and mussels with chervil.

As the chef is sourcing surplus food, the menu is subject to change.   

'At Christmas we create a huge amount of unnecessary food waste,' Mr Hunt said. 

'With many people hungry at such a festive time I wanted to create an alternative Christmas. 

'Let's celebrate this abundance of food by using it to raise money for the people that really need it most'.

Both Borough Market and Mr Hunt regularly work with charity projects including FareShare, FoodSave, FoodCycle and StreetSmart to help reduce food waste. 

As a member of the Slow Food Chef Alliance, Mr Hunt focuses on making sustainable, seasonal and foraged ingredients the focus of his European peasant dish-inspired menus.

Borough Market's David Matchett said: 'As part of Borough's ongoing commitment to sustainability we want to prove the value of surplus food by using it to cook a delicious four course Christmas feast. 

Wonky vegetables and blemished fruits as well as foraged fresh produce and fish caught using sustainable fishing methods from recommended healthy stocks will be used to create the Italian-style four-course meal

'We want to encourage people to think twice about what they put in the bin and do their bit to reduce food wastage.'

The Feast will take place on Sunday 14th December in Borough Market's Three Crown Square. Fifty per cent of profits will be donated to FareShare, the food waste charity. 

Tickets start at £38 and are available to purchase through Eventbrite.
