President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that Vice President Joe Biden will lead an effort to come up with policies to address gun violence amid calls for action following the massacre of 26 people, including 20 children, in a Connecticut elementary school last week.

The president affirmed the constitutional right for Americans to bear arms but clarified when it comes to the epidemic of gun violence 'if there is even one thing we can do to prevent any of these events, we have a deep obligation – all of us – to try,' at a White House press conference.

Mr Obama said that Mr Biden will work with members of his cabinet and other officials to come up with proposals by January - assuring the American public this is not merely a Washington commission to study the issue but promised real reforms in a timely manner.

'If we are not getting right keeping our children safe then nothing else matters,' the president said about the need for action and bi-partisan compromise.

The president praised Vice President Biden, who as a former Senator from Delaware led the effort for the 1994 crime bill.

Biden will work with key cabinet members, reach out to stakeholders and members of Congress to create a list of recommendations for reforms in gun laws, access to mental health care and school safety.

Mr Obama reiterated several times in his comments on Wednesday that Biden's task is not to review or study the issue but to provide action items to the president.

Based on their recommendations, Mr Obama said he will present concrete proposals, as soon as his State of the Union address on January 29 - just 41 days from today.

Mr Obama referenced the increased push for tighter controls
on gun ownership in the aftermath of the tragedy at the Sandy Hook Elementary
school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14. A 20-year-old gunman, Adam
Lanza, entered the school and killed 20 children and 6 adults.

The Connecticut massacre was the fourth shooting rampage to claim multiple lives in the United States this year.

The American public seemed numb after the school shooting and even Republican and Southern politicians, typically aligned with the powerful gun lobby, have said that something needed to be done to prevent future tragedies.

One such lawmaker is Democratic Senator 
Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The gun rights advocate said he would now 
be open to more regulation of military-style rifles like the one used in
Newtown. Obama spoke with him on Tuesday, the White House said.

Mr Obama said he found it 'encouraging that people of all different background and beliefs and  political persuasions' are willing to challenge past assumptions and address the issue of gun violence.

He noted the 'strong tradition of gun ownership that has been handed down
from generation to generation in the U.S.' and recognized the responsible, law-abiding gun owners in the U.S. but said more must be done to prevent guns from being illegally obtained and reaching the hands of the wrong people.

Gun control has been a relatively low priority for most U.S. politicians due to 
the widespread popularity of guns in America and the clout of the 
National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful gun industry lobby.

The constitutional right to bear arms, listed in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has continued to be upheld even after mass shootings.

The president said he is hopeful that the NRA will 'do some self-reflection' after the horror of seeing 6- and 7-year-old children and their teachers being killed at the school in Connecticut.

White House spokesman Jay Carney had earlier said that Obama was 'actively supportive' of legislation to reinstate a ban on assault-style weapons but despite the support, the president was perceived to exert minimal effort to ensure the legislation was passed during his first presidential term.

The ban had passed under a Democrat-controlled Congress in 1994 but expired in 2004. Carney said 
Obama would back U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein's effort to reinstate an 
assault weapons ban.

When asked about his inaction on Wednesday, the president defended himself and assured the American public that he hasn't been on vacation, adding that the events of last week has put everything in perspective. 

'If we are not getting right keeping our children safe then nothing else matters,' he said.

Obama said that the assault-style weapons ban would be one of the many issues Biden would be reviewing and also pressed for Congress to finally confirm a director of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms (ATF). There has not been an official head of the federal agency in six years.

Unnamed former and current ATF officials have alleged the influential gun lobby has worked to limit 
the resources available to ATF and to prevent leadership at the agency.

Obama has also signaled that he would support closing a gun 
show loophole allowing people to buy arms from private dealers without 
background checks and would be interested in legislation limiting 
high-capacity ammunition magazines, according to Carney.

During the second presidential debate in October, Obama had said he believed that 'weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.'

'What I want is a comprehensive strategy, part of it is seeing if we get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,' he added.

Many pro-gun lawmakers have been calling for a greater focus on mental health issues and the impact of violent 
entertainment, a position Mr Obama said he also supported.

He said that 'no single gun law can't solve all these problems,' in his announcement, made in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House.

The room is named for President 
Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was shot and permanently
disabled during an assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981.

Brady has since become a gun control advocate and had a piece of legislation, the Brady Handgun 
Violence Prevention Act of 1994, named in his honor.
