He told the inquest: 'I picked up the baby and the baby started screaming. I thought that was the best thing because obviously the baby was alive.'  

The inquest has heard it was Ms Shin's final 'selfless act' of throwing her 11-month-old baby Meera, whom she was carrying when she crossed the road, that saved the baby's life.

Ms Shin's other daughter, Kelly, 11, who was returning from a three day school camp, was on the bus that hit her mother.

The Glebe Coroner's Court heard that Ms Shin, was distracted by waving to her daughter on the bus when she crossed the road.

Mr Agostino was waiting at the traffic lights next to the bus.

He said he saw the bus turn left and noticed a woman walking across the road.

He said the bus clipped the woman and pulled her under it.

'I saw something fling out of her hands but I didn't think anything of it at that point,' he said.

Mr Agostino said he started running after the bus yelling 'stop, stop'.

'I started bashing on his window and he came to a stop,' he said.

Mijin was tragically killed by a bus in 2012 in Beecroft 

'I turned back and I looked at her - it was pretty bad.'

An emotional Mr Agostino said Ms Shin had rolled under the bus between the front and rear axles.

He said the bus driver was doing the best he could and performed CPR on Ms Shin.

Senior Constable Wayne Stephenson said in his opinion the pedestrian crossing light was green but Ms Shin was in a blind spot.

'The blind spot on the bus played a big role,' the crash investigator said.

The location of the fatal crash was a known black spot, the inquest heard, and had been the scene of serious injury crashes in the past.
