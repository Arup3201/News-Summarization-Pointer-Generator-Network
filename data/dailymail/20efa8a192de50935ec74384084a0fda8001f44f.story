A disabled couple, both 85, were fined after they spent too long doing their food shopping and overstayed in a car park by just 19 minutes. 

Joyce Woraker walks with two sticks after having a hip replacement while her husband Ivor has become slow on his feet as he recovers from a heart attack.

The couple went to Aldi in Colchester in Essex to do their weekly food shop but ended up overstaying the store's 90 minute limit in the car park and received a fine. 

They were ordered to pay £40 after they overstayed by 19 minutes and were warned this would increase to £70 if they did not pay within two weeks. 

Ivor and Joyce Woraker, both 85 and disabled, were given a £40 fine for overstaying in Aldi car park in Essex 

Their daughter Carolyn McKeever, 60, of Essex, challenged the fine saying that her parents' disabilities made it difficult for them to walk round the store at speed. 

'It is fair to say they are not the fastest up and down the shopping aisles and both of them have to stop for breath every so often,' she said.

'For people like my parents, doing their shopping is like a day out.

'They stop and look at the offers and talk with other customers.'

Mr and Mrs Woraker had parked in a disabled bay of the car park for Aldi in Colchester for 109 minutes 

The elderly couple, from Layer Marney, Essex, had parked in a disabled bay at 10.51am outside the store. 

But after doing their weekly food shop they returned to their car at 12.40pm. They had been parked for a total of 109 minutes - just 19 minutes over the limit imposed at the site. 

The couple were told the £40 fine could rise to £70

Days later they received a letter from Parking Eye, which runs the car park at the supermarket, informing them they had incurred a fine. 

Mrs McKeever tried to challenge the fine with Aldi but was told she would need to provide a copy of her parents' receipt. 

The couple had not kept this and Aldi said they were unable to identify their visit because they paid with cash. 

Staff at the store said it was also impossible to identify the couple's trip despite Mrs McKeever listing 15 items they had bought.

Mrs McKeever said her parents were upset as they had never been fined in their lives. 

She agreed to pay the charge but lodged an appeal on their behalf.

Parking Eye has since agreed to rescind the fine after it was contacted by a local newspaper about the story. 

Mrs McKeever said: 'Allowing 90 minutes for people with disabilities to get around the shop isn't enough.

'Of course it is a enough for able people, but for disabled people like my parents, it just isn't.'
