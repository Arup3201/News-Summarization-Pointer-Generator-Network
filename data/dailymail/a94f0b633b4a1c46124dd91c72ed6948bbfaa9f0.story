Here's an anecdote that tells you a little of what you need to know about Bob Torrance, unquestionably one of the best coaches this country has produced and who passed away in his sleep on Friday aged 82.

A few years ago the Association of Golf Writers were keen to give him an outstanding services award. Only trouble was the AGW dinner, where the award is given out, is the social highlight of Open week, attended by over 300 people and Bob didn’t like giving speeches or being singled out for attention.

Eventually we persuaded him to attend and he duly looked petrified when it was his turn to stand up. He uttered about 30 words but it was so clearly spoken from the heart, he said more in that time than plenty of other speakers say in 20 minutes. He was given a standing ovation.

On the practice ground, you couldn’t shut him up, of course. His idea of heaven was nattering away for hours on end about the golf swing. Quite honestly his Scottish accent was so strong I struggled to understand what he was saying half the time but I still liked listening to him.

In Hoylake yesterday, players who knew him, from Darren Clarke to Tiger Woods, paid their own small tribute by wearing black ribbons on their caps.

Bob produced one fine European golfer and Ryder Cup captain in Sam Torrance, coached many other good tour pros including another Ryder Cup player and skipper in Paul McGinley, and one undeniably great golfer in Padraig Harrington.

When they teamed up in 1998, Harrington had a wonderful short game but it would be kind to describe his long game as average. Over the next decade they worked so hard to transform his mediocre swing into one that delivered no fewer than three majors.

‘It wouldn’t have happened without Bob, absolutely not,’ said Harrington. ‘He was like a father to me.’McGinley took time out from a holiday in Portugal to pen a heartfelt missive. ‘I feel blessed to have known Bob and to have had him as my coach since 1992,’ he reflected.

‘Not only was he a world-class coach, a fact recognised across the game, he was also one of my favourite people in life.’

But it was Harrington who summed up how the golfing world should remember him.

‘His passing is not to be mourned,’ said the Irishman. ‘He did this game a great service. He loved it and whoever came into contact with him walked away with a better experience. Isn’t that a fabulous way to go out of this world?’

Our condolences to his wife June and Sam.
