No arguments this time. Nico Rosberg took pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix with a lap so quick and so emphatic that it set the World Championship alight.

After inflicting the misery of Monaco on his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton a fortnight ago, Rosberg finished 0.079sec ahead here. There was no possible deception in this performance.

The simpler, faster configuration of this circuit next to the Olympic rowing lake was meant to be more to Hamilton’s liking than Monaco’s tight streets (though he is hardly sluggish there either). He set the fastest times in the first two sessions of qualifying, but then Rosberg struck.

All smiles: Nico Rosberg edged out team-mate Lewis Hamilton to pole position in Montreal

Smiles better: Hamilton was cordial to Rosberg after qualifying in contrast to Monaco a fortnight ago

He
 banged a fast lap in in the shoot-out for pole, a banker that he later 
beat. Hamilton pushed hard but simply had not got the pace he needed.

In
 contrast to Monaco, Hamilton was cordial afterwards. He was hardly 
smiling, quite reasonably, but put his arm around Rosberg in the 
pictures afterwards.

Rosberg
 said: ‘I know it is a track where Lewis is traditionally very quick and
 I am happy it has worked out. All weekend I have progressed well. It’s 
very cool.

‘I have been 
looking at data, working with my engineers, seeing where I can do 
better. Having won the last race brought me some momentum.’

Out in front: Rosberg secured pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal

Pipped: Hamilton was 0.079 slower than his German team-mate and will start in second place

Clenched fist: Rosberg punches the air

Hamilton
 said: ‘Nico did a fantastic job today. Congratulations to him. 
Sometimes sessions don’t work out. I think it will be a close battle 
tomorrow. Overtaking will be very difficult seeing as Nico is in the 
same car as mine and is so close in pace.’

Nobody
 was likely to challenge Mercedes for pole, though Felipe Massa held the
 fastest time during the second session before Hamilton and Rosberg 
blitzed their way to the front. Red Bull’s world champion Sebastian 
Vettel finally came third – an upturn in his fortunes. Jenson Button of 
McLaren ninth, ahead of his team-mate Kevin Magnussesn in 12th.

Further
 down the grid, Marcus Ericsson caused a red flag to be waved when he 
crashed his Caterham towards the end of the first session. The Swede was
 not even on a fast lap at the time.

Hamilton,
 though he says it will be hard to overtake, has great history at this 
track. He won here in 2010 and 2012, building on his success in 2007, 
his first ever Formula One victory.

It
 was a markedly different Hamilton back then.

He was 22, his father held
 his umbrella on the grid, he earned a ‘mere’ £500,000, lived in Woking 
and barely counted a rapper among his friends. But even in those 
intoxicating days of his nascent career, there were early signs of the 
controversy that has stalked his career intermittently since.

Flying high: Valtteri Bottas qualified fourth ahead of his Williams team-mate Felipe Massa

Then,
 as now, the preceding race in Monaco was contentious. Hamilton had 
stated that he was not a ‘No 2’, implying that McLaren gave his 
team-mate Fernando Alonso the better strategy.

He
 put that aside to take pole here and held his nerve through four safety
 car phases, including the one prompted by his karting friend Robert 
Kubica’s somersaulting accident, to win. It will take a similar 
clearness of thought to prevail here again today.

Montreal
 is one of Formula One’s minor jewels, conforming to the aphorism that 
all the sport’s best venues start with an ‘M’. Melbourne, Monaco, Monza 
are the others. Montreal has won its accolade by providing gripping 
races and turning its central streets into a carnival city for the 
weekend.

Trailing: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso could only manage a disappointing seventh place

Mid pack: McLaren driver Jenson Button finished in ninth place in Montreal

So we should 
celebrate that the city has agreed a 10-year extension to host the race.
 The estimated £100million they will pay Bernie Ecclestone for the 
privilege is less than most venues, a sign of its value to the sport.  
Organisers will spend £20million on improving the paddock, which wears a
 faded 1970s look.

Speaking 
of the Seventies, if Hamilton manages to overhaul Rosberg on Sunday he will 
equal the 27 career wins of Sir Jackie Stewart. The Scotsman reached his
 total in 99 races; Hamilton will have done so in 136.

Button
 is not writing off his former team-mate. ‘This are two tracks where 
Lewis is pretty much unbeatable – Abu Dhabi and here,’ he said.

Rosberg is warned, but on Saturday night he was right to be smiling broadly.
