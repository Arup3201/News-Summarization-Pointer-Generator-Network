Long have clothing designers, High Street brands and travel agents worshiped the  'Kate effect' - where anything the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to commercial gold.

Now it seems Prince William is commanding serious pulling power of his own after a recent royal trip to Malta caused a 71 per cent spike in interest in the area.

According to hotel comparison website Trivago, online search traffic for the island has jumped after the second in line to the throne stepped in for Kate as the royal guest of honour at the 50th anniversary celebrations of Malta's independence.

Kate was due to travel to the small travel for her first official solo overseas visit but due to the effects of acute morning sickness had to pull out.

Into the breach came Prince William, whose role as understudy has sparked a 71 per cent increase of travel interest to Qawra, a popular district in St. Paul's Bay on the northeast of the island.

Hotel searches also increased by 60 per cent to the tourist resort of nearby Mellieha and by 41 per cent in Bugibba, which is located adjacent to Qawra.

Travel interest increased by 31 per cent to the capital of Valletta. During the trip Prince William has stayed at San Anton Palace in nearby Attard and was shown around by the nation's President, Marie Louise Coleiro Preca. 

He spent time at the St. John's Co-Cathedral, Auberge de Castille and Upper Barrakka Gardens, all located in Valletta and took a boat tour of Valletta's Grand Harbour.

Hotel searches made over the weekend were compared to searches made the previous weekend before the royal visit.

Denise Bartlett, a spokesperson for Trivago said, 'Although William joked that the crowds were hoping for his wife instead, these figures show that his visit clearly had an impact among UK travellers. 

Malta is an exciting and varied destination of historic towns, beautiful beaches and a Mediterranean climate. It's great to see the island receive the recognition it deserves.'

Malta is in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, halfway between Gibraltar and Alexandria, and Sicily and North Africa.

It is first thought to have been populated  in 4,500 BC after  explorers from the neighbouring island of Sicily noticed land lying on the horizon and decided to cross the narrow waters to investigate. 

Since then it has developed a rich cultural heritage despite being such a small island. Holiday goers can explore Neolithic temples, pristine beaches, bars, restaurant, holiday resorts or go to traditional musical festivals.

On 21 September 1964, Malta was granted independence  and became a sovereign nation within the Commonwealth retaining the Queen as its Head of State.
