Roberto Martinez has encouraged Everton’s squad to make history and overcome the problems he believes are preventing English clubs from thriving in Europe.

Everton’s sole European trophy came in the 1985 European Cup- Winners’ Cup and Martinez wants to mark that anniversary by guiding his team to the Europa League final. They will reach the last eight by avoiding defeat against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday night.

Given how wretched their domestic form has been, few would have thought Everton could be the Barclays Premier League’s last European representatives and Martinez feels they have overcome huge obstacles to get this far.

Premier League sides have won only five of the 28 European trophies possible since the turn of the millennium and the manager believes the punishing nature of the domestic competition is taking its toll.

‘Our British competition demands every game to be 100 per cent,’ said Martinez. ‘Teams that play in other leagues in Europe, they cruise through games and get through at 50 per cent. It is unfair on British teams.

‘A break in the winter would enable the players to regenerate and refresh — a key period in the season is February and March so I think the biggest teams are a little bit unfairly treated. The answer is clear — you need to have a bigger squad at this level where you can make five or six changes to keep the team performing at the same level.

Martinez has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both Everton and Dynamo Kiev 

‘I find playing Thursday and Sunday is tough. The Europa League teams should play at least at 4pm, and also be given as many home games as possible after they have been away. We should protect our teams a bit more, otherwise we shoot ourselves in the foot.’ 

Progress in Kiev will not be straightforward. Everton were unable to train on the Olympic Stadium pitch last night as it was covered in huge white tarpaulins and had heat lamps ready to repair a surface reported to be rain-sodden.

Martinez, however, is not going to use the pitch as an excuse, as he is far more anxious about the threat Dynamo pose. Sergei Rebrov’s side have not lost at home this season but Everton will not be cautious in their approach.

‘We have got great memories of being in Europe this season,’ said Martinez. ‘This experience has been fantastic and we want to progress.

‘It is an opportunity, something for us to enjoy rather than fear. We want to show everyone what we can do.’

There is little doubt the 2-1 first-leg win against Dynamo, followed by a 3-0 dismantling of Newcastle, has improved the atmosphere in the squad and helped restore confidence.

‘It was brilliant to get those two results back to back,’ said Everton defender Seamus Coleman. ‘We haven’t been happy with our league form but it is turning.

‘We played ever so hard to get into this competition. Our goal at the start was to win it. It has been a long time since the club won anything and it would be nice if we could change that.’
