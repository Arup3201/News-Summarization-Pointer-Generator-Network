Authorities say a man stole 12 bottles of hand sanitizer from a central Pennsylvania hospital so he could mix it with orange juice and drink it for the alcohol it contained.

The Altoona Mirror reports 51-year-old Lee Ammerman has been mailed a summons requiring him to surrender Feb. 5 on charges of theft and receiving stolen property.

Police say an employee at UPMC Altoona hospital saw Ammerman steal a bottle of sanitizer in October by hiding it in an arm sling he was wearing. They say Ammerman returned to steal more sanitizer twice in December.

Police say they confronted Ammerman, who acknowledged stealing the sanitizer, saying, 'I mix the liquid with orange juice.'

He was kept at the hospital and questioned about the thefts on January 2.

He was on his way to the bathroom when officers confronted him about the theft and after brief hesitation, he admitted to his crime.

Ammerman confessed to stealing 'a large amount' of hand sanitizer containers each worth $6.65.

The hospital is seeking about $80 in restitution. UMPC Altoona said that employees had to replace four to six containers daily in November and December.

Ammerman doesn't have a listed phone or an attorney named in court records.

The Mail Online contacted the hospital to determine whether Ammerman was ever a patient at the hospital or just a sticky-fingered visitor.

As it turns out, Ammerman only visits the hospital for its unique beverages such as hand-sanitizer.

A spokesperson joked and said Ammerman was just there for 'the good stuff.'

He also said that the hand-sanitizer was 'non-toxic.'

Hand sanitizer can be toxic because of chemical agents but most people hospitalized for hand sanitizer consumption are treated for alcohol poisoning, reports about.com. The alcohol content is so high it's easy to overdose without feeling the effects.
