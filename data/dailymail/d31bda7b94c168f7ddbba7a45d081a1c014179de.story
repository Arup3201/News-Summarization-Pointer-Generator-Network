The latest mobile app doesn’t just tell you where your friends and co-workers are – it tells you where nearby women are, and allows you to see their full name, photos, and send them messages.

The Girls Around Me application takes your GPS data from Foursquare and searches for women in the immediate area who have also checked in on the location-based mobile service.

News of the app’s less-than-careful data sharing has caused considerable online outrage, with many lambasting the app for making stalking easy and taking advantage of those who don’t understand privacy policies of social media.

There's an app for that: Girls Around Me searches for women who have checked in via Foursquare

Stalker's paradise: The app promises to put you in control of finding women in the area, who often have no idea they are being searched

But Girls Around Me is a two-way street – users are first asked to link Girls Around me to their personal Facebook account.

Once downloaded, the app requests a host of information, including the user’s Facebook log in, pictures, basic information including gender and age, as well as photos and email addresses.

It asks permission to run even when the app itself is closed, thus allowing Girls Around Me to collect location data at all times.

The app’s website advertises that Girls Around me ‘puts you in control!’

It continues: ‘Reveal the hottest nightspots, who’s in them, and how to reach them…’ It also says that users can easily find ‘love’ or ‘a one-night stand.’

Though the initial app download is free, users have to pay 99 cents for every ‘energy pack,’ to search for nearby women in area at an accelerated rate.

Stanford lecturer Elizabeth Stark told the New York Times’ Bits blog that the application requires far too much information.

‘This would be a very different application if it didn’t like back to Facebook, which is a treasure trove of information,’ she said. ‘With that link, this app could easily be a “let’s stalk women” app.’

Sophy Tobias, a spokesperson for Facebook, told MailOnline that people are responsible for how their information is viewed.

She wrote: ‘People can control the privacy for their posts from Privacy Settings, or can customise the settings for individual posts from Facebook.com or their mobile device. Essentially, if the person posting has set the privacy for their post to anything but ‘public,’ it will not appear in the app.’

Cult of Mac said the app is, more than anything, a ‘wake-up call about privacy.’

The blog notes that Facebook and Foursquare users who don’t understand the importance of privacy are putting themselves in compromising positions.

They wrote: ‘Most privacy settings on social networks default to share everything with everyone, and since most people never change those… well, they end up getting sucked up into apps like this.’

Foursquare spokesperson Laura Covington later released a statement following the original report by Cult of Mac.

‘This is a violation of our API policy, so we’ve reached out to the developer and shut off their API access,’ she said.

However, the app is still available for download in the iTunes store. It is made by SMS Services O.o.o., which has also produced CoinKeeper, a budget tool, and Grocery Mate, a shopping list app.
