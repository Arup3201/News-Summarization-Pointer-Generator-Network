As our selfie-obsession continues unabated, the trend has grown to encompass the ‘healthie’, with the subject captured in an elaborate yoga poses or in the gym; the ‘shelfie’, where you show off your intellectual side by snapping your bookshelf and, of course the ‘belfie’.

Sparked by celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kelly Brook and Rihanna the ’belfie’ involves taking a picture of your own derriere, usually in a rather flimsy pair of pants or thong.

For those who feel it necessary to share their backside with the world, being proud of your posterior is a must, which involves not only some serious squatting sessions, but also perfect skin. This has all led to an explosion in the popularity of the 'bottom facial'.

Never one to shy away from exposing her body, Rihanna shared this Belfie snap with her Instgram followers

These involve the same spot-busting treatments and firming masks usually used on the face and neck, as well as cleansing and extractions of pimples.

EF MEDISPA, which collated the information, says many of those undergoing the bum facials said they were motivated by seeing celebrities' perfect behinds displayed on social media.

Kim Kardashian caused a stir when she took to Twitter to reveal her post-baby body in all its glory in a revealing white swimsuit after the reality star welcomed daughter North into the world back in June.

Thrusting the 33-year-old back into the spotlight, the sexy selfie caused a media storm of epic proportions.

The revealing shot sent shockwaves through social media sites within moments of Kim posting it, attracting more than 3,300 comments on MailOnline and sparking a wave of copycat images.

Lady Gaga's Belfie shows why women feel increasing pressure to obtain a 'perfect' bottom

Rihanna, Kelly Brook, Cheryl Cole and Lady Gaga are just some of the A list names who have promoted their toned tooshies on their social media accounts.

Esther Fieldgrass, who owns the spa, said: ‘As they spend the majority of the year hidden away in clothes, our bottoms don't get the care and attention they deserve, with many of us often neglecting this area from our skincare routine altogether.

‘Combine this with desk jobs, tight underwear that causes friction and traps sweat against the skin, and tiny hair follicles which can become blocked, and you have the perfect recipe for a spotty bottom.’
