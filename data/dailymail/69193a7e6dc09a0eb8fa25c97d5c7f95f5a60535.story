A Chicago man accused of stabbing his roommate and biting off a piece of his ear has been found in Texas.

Ross Jacobs, 27, is charged with attempted murder after allegedly stabbing his roommate with a butcher's knife multiple times as he slept around 3am in their apartment near the University of Chicago.

The former graduate student at the institution, who is originally from the city's northern suburbs, is mentally ill and on medication, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Jacobs had seen his father in Memphis on Saturday before heading further south, investigators said.

He was arrested in Dallas County, more than 900 miles and 14 hours driving from Chicago, on Monday after withdrawing money from an ATM

The suspect's roommate, also 27, survived the  attack on Friday but had serious injuries.

His neighbor described Jacobs as having 'his own mind in his own world.'

'I've always encountered this guy and I'm always on alert when I see him or approach him or whether he's approaching me,' Delaney Gentle told ABC7.

Chicago police believed that Jacobs could have been armed and dangerous. 

Chicago police have been looking for Jacobs since Friday, and he is believed to have seen his father in Memphis on Saturday before heading to Texas

The circumstances behind his arrest are not known.

Despite the suspect's everyday behavior being described as 'not of a normal person,' he had an impressive academic track record before leaving University of Chicago in 2013. 

Jacobs was an undergraduate at Bowdoin College in Maine, where he graduated with a major in political philosophy in 2010.

He won a scholarship from the conservative Phillips Foundation and wrote a column for the student newspaper in addition to reviving the college's literary debate society.

The student attended New Trier High School, part of a district that regularly ranks among the best in the country.
