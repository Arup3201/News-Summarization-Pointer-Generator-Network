Last word: Tony Benn recorded a farewell message 12 years ago

Even in death he had the last word. Yesterday a ‘beyond the grave’ interview recorded by Tony Benn was released following his death at the age of 88.

In the extraordinary clip filmed 12 years ago, he thanked his family and late wife Caroline for their support, and said he always tried to speak his mind during his political career – but said he hoped that he had not caused offence.

Mr Benn was interviewed by Channel 4 News in April 2002 – on the understanding that it would be broadcast after his death.

He said: ‘As by definition I won’t be able to say this again, can I take this opportunity of thanking my family, my mother and father, and my two brothers, and above all Caroline who inspired me over the 50 years of our marriage and my children and grandchildren.

‘All the many, many other people who supported me, encouraged me and taught me so much.

‘And I hope that in return I encouraged them and that I didn’t give offence because I tried to speak my mind and that’s what you’ve got to do in politics. So thank you very much.’ Laughing he added:

‘And I’ll check that on transmission’.

Yesterday politicians from all sides paid tribute to the veteran Left-winger, a Labour MP for half a century who held four ministerial posts and remained a dedicated campaigner well into his 80s.

Labour leader Ed Miliband praised Mr Benn as an ‘iconic figure of our age’.

A critic of New Labour, Mr Benn supported the leadership of Mr Miliband.

In fact, he was a regular visitor to Mr Miliband’s childhood home in Primrose Hill, North London, because he was friendly with his Marxist academic father Ralph and political activist mother Marion.

In 1986, when Ed Miliband was 16, he spent his summer holiday working as an intern in Mr Benn’s basement study at his home in Holland Park.

Mr Benn wrote of his young charge: ‘Very helpful. He has just taken his O-levels and is at a loose end.’

He remained friendly with the Milibands over the years – although Ed and David had moved away from his ideas politically.

In December 2000, Benn wrote in his diaries about ‘the boys’ living ‘entirely in the world of the prime minister’s advisers’. Ed Miliband said  yesterday: ‘Whether you agreed with him or disagreed with him, everyone knew where he stood and what he stood for.’

There were less kindly words from former foe Denis Healey, who beat Mr Benn by a tiny margin for the deputy Labour leadership in 1981.

Former chancellor Lord Healey, 96, told Newsnight: ‘He was in my view an artificial Leftie. He was  trying to prove he was working class, he was very ashamed of his upper class background.’

He added: ‘There was quite a lot of bitterness because I felt he did the party enormous damage at that time, by the way he behaved, not just his views. He was extremely rude and offensive in what he said.’

However, David Cameron praised Benn as a ‘magnificent writer, speaker, diarist and campaigner’. He said: ‘There was never a dull moment listening to him, even when you disagreed with every word he said.’

Gordon Brown called him a  ‘powerful, fearless, relentless  advocate for social justice and  people’s rights’. 

And Tony Blair said: ‘Even when I disagreed with him, I always had enormous respect for his brilliance, his passion and his commitment to the people of Britain.’

The RMT rail union said last night Mr Benn was ‘a close personal friend’ of its leader Bob Crow – who died on Tuesday – and a strong supporter of the union.

Mr Benn was taken ill several weeks ago. In a statement his four children said he died at his home in Holland Park, West London, surrounded by his family.

The statement added: ‘We are comforted by the memory of his long, full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others as he sought to change the world for the better.’

His eldest son Stephen must now decide whether he wants to formally become the 3rd Viscount Stansgate, the title his father renounced. To do so he must apply to the Crown Office to be put on the Roll of Peers.

However, he would have to wait for a vacancy in the House of  Lords caused by the death of one of the four remaining Labour hereditary peers.

He buried the ashes of his beloved wife Caroline under the trees in the front garden of the family home in Essex, marked with a bust of her head and a marble headstone inscribed with the words ‘Author, teacher and socialist’.

Beneath the words, a space was left where his own name will now be inscribed.

Behind Tony Benn’s implacable Left-wing beliefs, there was a deeply emotional family man of great tenderness and tearful sentimentality.

Devoted: Tony Benn with Caroline in 1979. He proposed to her on this bench in 1949

For example, he always sobbed at the final scene in the film The Railway Children – the moment when the engine’s steam clears to reveal the father coming home from prison and the children running towards him.

Benn even persuaded Oxford City Council to sell him the wooden bench on which Caroline was sitting when he proposed to her in 1949, just nine days after they had met.

He placed the seat, too, by her headstone, and would spend hours sitting there, wondering where she was and when he would join her. They had been married for 51 years and he never got over her death.

‘She was the greatest inspiration of my life,’ he said. ‘I think of her many times each day.’

‘Love and friendship are the secret of happiness,’ he wrote. ‘When I got married, my dad’s advice was to keep a big balance of affection in the bank, because you’re going to need it.’

Long-serving: Tony and Caroline Benn campaigning in Bristol - November 1950

Further back, in his childhood, he had sat on his grandmother’s bed when she was very ill and remembered her telling him: ‘The great thing about your last journey is that you don’t have to pack.’

He recalled Caroline’s view of death, too, as ‘a great adventure’. Her courage had a great influence on his own thinking about death, saying: ‘I’m not afraid of it – but I don’t want to go just yet.’

Caroline was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996 and died in November 2000, and the bleak emptiness Benn felt as a widower never left him.

Once or twice, he admitted, his thoughts strayed to Dignitas, the Swiss-based euthanasia centre.

What kept him going, though, was his four children and nine grandchildren, who he described as ‘an inspiration’.

He once said: ‘My idea of a perfect day is to see all four of my children.’

They are Stephen, the eldest, who works for the Institute of Biology; Melissa, who has written novels; Joshua, who works for the homeless charity Crisis; and Hilary, Labour MP for Leeds Central and a member of the Shadow Cabinet.

Benn was thrilled when Hilary got a job in the Blair government as international development minister.

Seeing how lost he was without Caroline, his children and their children did their best to cheer him up.

There was the occasion when Melissa’s daughter, Sarah, recounted to her grandfather how he had taken her when she was much younger to watch a Harry Potter film.

During a scene in which Harry opens a photo album and looks at his parents and himself as a small child, Tony Benn had burst into tears. On the way home, Sarah told him: ‘When you die, Dan-Dan, you will be in my heart, and now there is a piece of you in my heart already.’

There was never a day, either, when Caroline was not in Tony Benn’s heart and his thoughts. Now, they are together again.
