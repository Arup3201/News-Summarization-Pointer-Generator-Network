The number of adults and children using food banks has exceeded 900,000 for the first time according to new research.

The Trussell Trust said that 913,000 people received at least three-days' emergency help over the past twelve months.

Researchers claimed the 163 percent jump in people seeking assistance is due to rising living costs combined with low pay and problems over welfare payments.

The Trussell Trust said they now had more than 400 food banks across the UK with a further two opening every week

The Trussell Trust's chairman, Chris Mould, said: 'That 900,000 people have received three days' food from a food bank - close to triple the numbers helped last year - is shocking in 21st-century Britain.

'But, perhaps most worrying of all, this figure is just the tip of the iceberg of UK food poverty. It doesn't include those helped by other emergency food providers, those living in towns where there is no food bank, people who are too ashamed to seek help or the large number of people who are only just coping by eating less and buying cheap food.

'In the last year we've seen things get worse, rather than better, for many people on low incomes. It's been extremely tough for a lot of people, with parents not eating properly in order to feed their children and more people than ever experiencing seemingly unfair and harsh benefits sanctions.

He said: 'Unless there is determined policy action to ensure that the benefits of national economic recovery reach people on low incomes, we won't see life get better for the poorest any time soon.

'A more thoughtful approach to the administration of the benefits regime and sanctions in particular, increasing the minimum wage, introducing the living wage and looking at other measures such as social tariffs for essentials like energy would help to address the problem of UK hunger.'

The trust said its food banks were now offering welfare advice and providing essentials such as washing powder, nappies and hygiene products to families at 'breaking point'.

A letter signed by 36 Anglican bishops and more than 600 church leaders from all major dominations calls for urgent Government action to tackle food poverty.

According to the report eight out of ten food banks claimed many of those using the service had faced sanctions over benefit payments which left them unable to afford food.

The government introduced tougher rules aimed at benefit claimants last October including raising the minimum sanction for violations from one to four weeks.

More than 20 charities, including the Trussell Trust have written to the government accusing them of violating people's basic right to food.

According to the letter: 'We call on the Government to take immediate action to ensure that no one in the UK is denied their most basic right to sufficient and adequate food.'

The Department of Work and Pensions said it was the growth in the number of food banks which was driving demand rather than new benefit rules

The Department of Work and Pensions said it was the growth in the number of food banks which has increased demand rather than new benefit regulations.

A spokesperson said: 'We're spending £94 billion a year on working age benefits so that the welfare system provides a safety net to millions of people who are on low incomes or unemployed so they can meet their basic needs.

'Even the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development say there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago, benefit processing times are improving, and even the Trussell Trust's own research recognises the effect their marketing activity has on the growth of their business.

'The employment rate is the highest it's been for five years and our reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families by promoting work and helping people lift themselves out of poverty.'

A public vigil will be held tonight in Westminster to highlight the issue.
