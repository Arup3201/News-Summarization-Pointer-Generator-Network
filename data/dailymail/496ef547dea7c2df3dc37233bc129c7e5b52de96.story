A British tourist left with half a head after falling from the balcony of a Thai hotel has had his skull rebuilt - with the same metal used in space shuttles.

Lee Charie, 32, from Stansted Abbots in Hertfordshire, was discovered lying on the floor with the left side of his skull smashed in after the falling 22ft from a hotel walkway in Koh Tao in 2012.

Sixteen months after the plunge, he has had a six-inch titanium plate fitted to cover the dent, and now hopes to find a 'beautiful wife' and win the lottery.

Before and after: Lee Charie, 32, had to have part of his skull removed after falling 22 feet from a balcony in Thailand two years ago

Tough: The plate now in his skull is made from strong titanium, the same material used in space shuttles

After the horrific incident, paramedics 
managed to resuscitate the extra from The Only Way is Essex after two 
days without showing any signs of life.

But to allow his brain to recover, doctors removed a quarter of his smashed skull.

When he was well enough to be transferred back to Britain two weeks later, he was handed the missing chunk of his head in a box and carried it in his luggage.

Now the swimming pool maintenance worker's head has been fixed - with a plate made from metal normally found in the fuselage of space shuttles and passenger jets.

Mr Charie said: 'There's a big slab of titanium in my head now and I've got the nickname 'space shuttle head' from my mates.

'The first thing I thought when I got it was that when I go through metal detectors at the airport it's going to go off.

'There has been lots of positives since having the implant. I do feel more confident with it.

'But physically I still have to be really careful with it and it can be painful. I can't party like I used to.

Consultation: Experts at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge then used the bone to mould the plate in place

'When I think about the accident I still get emotional. I think about my parents and family and what they had to go through.

'The worst part of the whole ordeal was realising emotionally that I died and they brought me back to life.

'Now I am just thinking about moving on with my life and moving into a new place. The whole thing has given me perspective.'

He had planned to spend 30 days in Thailand as part of a return trip to the country.

But while staying in the Tommy Resort, in Koh Tao, he fell from a second floor walkway smashing the side of his skull.

He had to have part of his skull removed while in intensive care for a fortnight and his family were told he could be paralysed down his right-hand side.

Size: The plate is around six inches long and is made from the same material used to construct giant passenger jet

But luckily the 32-year-old was strong enough to be transferred back to Britain on January 18.

He brought the fragment back to the UK in a sterile box in hand luggage which was guarded by his doctor.

Experts at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge then used the bone to mould a new titanium plate to be fitted in his head.

The plate is around six inches long and is made from the same material used to construct giant passenger jets and even space ships.

During the four hour operation, surgeons had to cut open his head and use three screws to fit the titanium plate over the gap in his skull

During the four hour op surgeons had to cut open his head and use three screws to fit the titanium plate over the gap in his skull.

The procedure would normally use four screws but Thai surgeons cut his skull too far back and there wasn't space to fit the final screw.

Now Lee hopes he can finally move on with his life after a year of operations and rehabilitation.

He said: 'You can't beat yourself up about something, at the end of the day I am here and I made it through.

'Now I just want to get a beautiful wife and win the lottery. Yeah, loads of money and beautiful women. No, I am just glad to be back.

'Last year I didn't have the chance to go out a lot. I couldn't stay awake for long periods of time.

'I used to be able to drink six or seven pints before getting drunk, now it's about three and I'm gone.

'So now I am just enjoying seeing my mates and doing normal things. Enjoying the things I have missed out on.

Ambitions: Now the plate has been fixed, he wants to find a wife and win the lottery

'I'm looking forward to going out a lot more this year and spending good times with good people.'

Christine Harkin, Clinical Nurse Specialist for Neuro Trauma, said surgeons even used 3D imaging equipment to make sure the mould was a perfect fit.

She said: 'The plate is made of titanium and is manufactured at the hospital by the Maxillo Facial Technicians.

'They use the part of the patient's bone that has been removed and use it to create a mould.

'The titanium is then hand-tempered and moulded into exactly the right shape to fit the patient's head.

'Modern techniques mean specialists can also use 3D imaging equipment to make sure the fit is 100 per cent accurate.

'Techniques are now changing and specialists are also looking at using different types of materials.

'On average, a plate like this would take several days to make and would cost around £900 to produce.'
