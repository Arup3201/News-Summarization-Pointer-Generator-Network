A 17-year-old cancer patient has said she understands 'death is the outcome' but that it is 'my life and my body' after being told she must undergo chemotherapy treatment by a court.

The court said Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was not legally mature enough to decide whether she should have the life-saving care.

Doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival, but without it there was a near-certainty of death within two years.

A state Supreme Court has ruled that 17-year-old cancer patient Cassandra Fortin must have chemotherapy

The teen says she understands 'death is the outcome' of refusing treatment, but that it should be her decision

Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine', but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition.  

She will have to wait until she turns 18 in September before she can make her own medical decisions.  

Cassandra, who has Hodgkin's Lymphoma, is currently confined in a room at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy. 

This is despite the teen saying she should be able to decide whether she undergoes the treatment or not and understands that 'death is the outcome' believing in the 'quality of my life, not the quantity'. 

Writing for the Hartford Courant, she said: 'This experience has been a continuous nightmare. I want the right to make my medical decisions. 

'It's disgusting that I'm fighting for a right that I and anyone in my situation should already have. 

'This is my life and my body, not DCF's and not the state's. I am a human — I should be able to decide if I do or don't want chemotherapy. Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine.'

She added: 'I believe there's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that I am willing to look for and explore. Not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it.'

Ms Fortin said: 'She has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body'

Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands.

These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50.

The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever).

It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it.

The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy.

Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent.

Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 

Connecticut Children's Medical Center recommended she receive chemotherapy after she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma last September.

But when the adolescent refused, with her mother's support, the state's Department of Children and Families (DCF) intervened.

Cassandra was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in November but was so distressed she ran away for a week. She was then taken in to custody by the DCF.

She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center and ordered to start chemo.

With the support of her mother, Jackie Fortin, of Windsor Locks, she refused any more when she returned. She said she wanted to seek alternative treatments that did not involve putting the 'poison' of chemotherapy in to her body. 

After the hospital reported Ms Fortin, the DCF took temporary custody of the teen and her mother was ordered to cooperate with medical care.

Her treatment resumed on December 17, with surgery to install in her chest a port used to administer the drugs, with chemotherapy resuming the next day.    

Describing the treatment, Cassandra wrote in the Hartford Courant: 'After a week, they decided to force chemotherapy on me. I should have had the right to say no, but I didn't. 

'I was strapped to a bed by my wrists and ankles and sedated. I woke up in the recovery room with a port surgically placed in my chest. I was outraged and felt completely violated. My phone was taken away, the hospital phone was removed from my room and even the scissors I used for art were taken.

I have been locked in this hospital for a month, missing time from work, not being able to pay my bills. I couldn't celebrate Christmas and New Year's with my friends and family.'  

At the Supreme Court hearing, child welfare agency officials defended their treatment of Cassandra, saying they have a responsibility to protect her.

'This is a curable illness, and we will continue to ensure that Cassandra receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult,' they said. 

Her mother and lawyer say they are considering their next step but expect to return to the trial court to more fully explore the mature minor argument.
