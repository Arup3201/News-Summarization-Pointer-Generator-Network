A distinct lack of organization, a huge fanfare surrounding a few big names, followed by a bizarre but somehow enthralling spectacle. If the Africa Cup of Nations follows the same pattern as the opening ceremony, the next three weeks will be a lot of fun.

During the pre-match festivities the Equato-Guinean fans in the Estadio de Bata seemed as excited for American RnB star Akon as they were for their collection of players, assembled primarily from the smaller leagues around Europe.

But that all changed after 16 minutes, when the game, and the tournament, came to life. Middlesbrough striker Emilio Nsue put the hosts ahead following brilliant work from young winger Kike, a reserve at Real Mallorca down the right, and Bata erupted. In the end it was not quite enough for the win, but it was a fine way to announce the tournament’s arrival.

Equatorial Guinea, unfancied coming into the tournament having not played a competitive match since June, and only knew they would be competing in the tournament a little over two months ago, when they took over as hosts. 

Equatorial Guinea (4-2-3-1): Ovono, Randy, Da Gracia, Mbele, Sipo; Zarandona, Ganet (Ellong 45); Kike (Belima 59), Balboa, Ivan (Bolado 90); Nsue

Goal: Nsue 16

Booked: Mbele 26, Ovono 80

Congo (4-4-2): Mafoumbi; Baudry, Babele, Moubhio F. Nganga; Gandze, N’Dinga, Oniangue, Moutou (Malonga 77); Dore (Douniama 65), Bifouma.

Booked: Mouhbio 23

Goal: Bifouma 87

Star Man: Kike

But, roared on by what felt like the whole city, they showed that they intend to continue this competition’s record of hosts making it past the group stage, which has stood since 1994.

And they could have won this, Balboa and Nsue both spurning good chances to extend the lead when the score was 1-0. 

Both strikers, however, fired tamely at Christoffer Mafoumbi in the Congo goal, while Nsue saw another strike harshly ruled out for offside. 

Three minutes from time they were punished, former West Brom forward Thievy Bifouma slotting home.

Up until the equalizer, Congo had offered little. Ladislas Douniama missed the clearest opportunities they created, forcing a good save from Felipe Ovono just moments after coming on before heading against the post from close range with 10 minutes left. It will not be enough to worry either Gabon or Burkina Faso, this group’s other sides. 

Congo manager Claude Le Roy was adamant that his side had been undone by the conditions.

Speaking after the match Le Roy, in his eighth Cup of Nations as a manager, was furious that the side's journey to the ground, usually around 12 minutes, took over an hour, in a bus with no air conditioning.
