A man stabbed his neighbour in a fight over a Barbie doll. Father of three Murat Ahmet lashed out after his daughter was accused of stealing the toy.

Ahmet, 35, stabbed his 39-year-old neighbour in Braunau, Austria, leaving him in need of hospital treatment.

He claimed: 'I wanted to protect my family'.

The incident occurred when Ahmet and family returned home from a friend's wedding.

When they returned a child was waiting by the driveway for them to return. The child asked Ahmet's daughter whether she had seen her missing Barbie, and the girl replied that she hadn't.

A short while later both sets of parents came outside, prompting the two families to argue. Both went back inside their homes, but Ahmet went back to knock on the other family's door.

He claimed it was outrageous that his daughter was accused of stealing, and after the argument escalated he was stabbed.

A spokesman for the Upper Austrian Police said: 'We are investigating and he faces serious GBH charges. It could have been a lot worse if the stab wounds had been elsewhere.'

The neighbour was hospitalised but has since been released and is expected to make a full recovery.
