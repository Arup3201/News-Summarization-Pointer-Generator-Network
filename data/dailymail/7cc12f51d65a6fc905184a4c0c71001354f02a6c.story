The New Mexico marital home once lived in by country music star Randy Travis has been put up for sale at $14.7million.

The singer has had a tough time of it recently following a divorce in 2010, a stroke and subsequent brain surgery last year.

He also pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was arrested in August 2012 when he was found naked after crashing his Pontiac Trans Am.

He was sentenced to two years of probation, fined $2,000 and given a 180-day suspended jail sentence.

Travis is now living in Texas and on the road to recovery but his ex-wife and former long time manager, Elizabeth Travis, has decided to sell the estate that she purchased in 2002.

Three wooden crosses: The Travis estate features hundreds of crosses, including on the gate

The wife of country singer Randy Travis bought this 220-acre parcel from New Mexico¿s former governor and fashioned it into a luxury ranch

Until his 2010 divorce from longtime wife and former manager Elizabeth Travis, the Grammy winner parked his tour bus in the estate¿s bus garage and spent much of his time at the home

He even kept a pet buffalo on site, as well as horses and cattle. Travis now lives in Texas, where he is recovering from a stroke

Elizabeth Travis bough 220 acres from New Mexico’s former governor and proceeded to build a number of adobe structures which was to become their home for the next 12 years.

She is now selling the 19,339-square-foot estate for a smaller home closer to central Santa Fe.

Custom designed and built by the Travises, the ranch buildings are in the Pueblo Revival style with the main house consisting of 8,750 square feet with five bedrooms and eight baths.

Travis included parking for his tour bus and tucked a bowling alley, shooting range and gymnasium into a building disguised as a traditional Adobe chapel.

The good life: Randy Travis' estate includes 20,000 square feet of living space with features such as traditional tiled floors and beamed ceilings

There was even space in the garage for Randy Travis to park his tour bus!

The property also includes a bowling alley and gymnasium tucked into an adobe building that looks, from the outside, like a traditional New Mexico chapel

He even kept a pet buffalo on site, as well as horses and cattle.

Elizabeth Travis decorated it with hundreds of crosses, including carved crosses on the estate’s gate.

Also in the main house are ten fireplaces, fitness room, chef’s kitchen, hardwood floors, home theater, library and home office.

There is a heated three-car garage attached.  Outside is a barn, guest house, heated pool, equestrian facilities, outdoor kitchen and views of the Sangre de Cristo and Jemez Mountains from the decks and patios.

At age 55, Travis’ career has already spanned 30 years, selling 25 million records, 22 of which were number one hits with six number one albums, six Grammy awards and six CMA awards.

Allan Watkiss from UKCountryRadio.com has his own thoughts on the property, 'His home sounds wonderful - but I'm not sure how many country music fans would be able to come up with the $15million to take it on. We wish him well in his recovery from surgery.'

Enormous: The couple bought the 220-acre property from former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King and built a main home and guest suite with a total of 20,000 square feet of living space

Distinctive style: The gated estate was home to the country star and his then-wife, Elizabeth Travis, for eight years until their divorce in 2010

The home is set on 220-acres of land making there plenty of room fo a courtyard such as this

The home, which has 10 fireplaces, is meticulously decorated with hand-carved doors, inlaid details and stitched leather ceilings

The kitchen, with its wood-burning stove, beamed ceiling and tiled floor, is the distinctive center of the home

The sale comes at a pivotal time for Travis.

Last year he was seriously ill suffering congestive heart failure and a stroke.

The illness came as Travis was trying to put his life back together after a series of embarrassing public incidents involving alcohol.

Travis pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in January 2013 following an arrest in 2012.

He was required to spend at least 30 days at an alcohol treatment facility and complete 100 hours of community service.

The main house and guest house are a combined 20,000 square feet with ceilings that have leather stitching, as well as hand carved doors, a library, a pool, a gym, shooting range, and a bowling alley

News of the listing comes just three months after Travis made his first public appearance after a critical illness

Travis bought the property with his then-wife Elizabeth Travis, with whom he had a nasty divorce. But the couple had a lot of fun in the home during 'the good old times'

His divorce against his ex-wife Elizabeth has been particularly nasty.

The couple divorced in 2010. Elizabeth Travis sued Randy in April 2011, claiming he 'intentionally interfered with' her role as his manager.

She was married to Travis for 19 years and managed him for 30, until, she claims, the singer and his attorneys terminated her contract without any written notice.

He also claims that his wife tried to cheat him out of his money by inflating her travel reimbursement requests.

Interiors of the home feature wood-beamed ceilings, tiled and hardwood flooring. The doors and windows show a mixed French and wooden pattern, some of which are hand carved

Some of its luxury amenities include a media room, a large family room, an office and a dressing room with ample closet space
