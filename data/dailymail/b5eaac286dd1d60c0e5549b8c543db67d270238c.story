For nine-year-old Xiang Xiang, there is only one ambition - he just wants to be able to look at himself in the mirror like other children.

The youngster suffered severe burns to his face and head four years ago after he fell into a fire, and underwent a skin graft operation that has meant he had to spend years wearing a mask to help his scorched flesh to heal.

Dubbed 'Mask Boy' in China after his plight was raised in online reports, Xiang Xiang (not his real name) would rather not have to wear the headgear – but also wants to be 'handsome' so that other people no longer stare or, worse, bully him.

The nine-year-old hates wearing the mask and it is hopes a series of further operations will rid him of the headgear

His family have taken him to Beijing, where he is set to undergo a series of further operations to repair the damage to his  face and body at a cost of around 300,000 yuan (£32,000).

Since being horrifically burned Xiang Xiang has only looked in the mirror once and seen the full extent of his disfigurement, according to his father.

'At the time he stared at the mirror for a long time and said one sentence, ''How did my face get so burnt?'' and then he never looked into the mirror again,' Mr Wang told the People's Daily.

'We are afraid he will be bullied and hurt. So this time coming to Beijing we must have our son healed so that he can be handsome again.' 

After the initial skin transplant, the boy was forced to endure a lengthy wait for further surgery to allow his breathing to fully recover from the ordeal.

The lengthy delay has led to Xiang Xiang becoming self conscious about his appearance and aware of how his facial expressions and vision are restricted.

'At the end of last year his breathing ability had recovered and was at the standard required for the operation to go ahead,' said Mr Wang.

'My son said to me that he had to do the operation so that he could get rid of the mask.' 

The boy was forced to endure the cruel stares of passers-by after he bravely decided to remove his mask as he travelled to the hospital for his latest round of treatment.

He told his father his father he needed further operations to 'get rid of the mask'

'People were staring at Xiang Xiang's injury which made the child very sad,' said Mr Wang.

'In the past my son hated the mask and often when he was getting ready to sleep he would hide the mask hoping that the next day he would not need to wear it any more.' 

Xiang Xiang was just five-years-old when he fell into the flames as he played with two friends in Fenyang. He also lost one finger on his left hand.

After undergoing an initial skin transplant he was forced to wear the white coloured mask that was specially designed to assist the healing process.

Heartbreaking images of little Xiang Xiang  were beamed around the globe and led to a fund being set up to help pay for the boy's treatment. 

The latest operations will look to address the opening and closing of his mouth, the limited use of his hand and hair loss. 

His father said when Xiang Xiang was getting ready to sleep he would sometimes hide the mask in the hope that the next  day he would not need to wear it any more

Xiang Xiang is said to hate the mask that protects his skin and is eager to finally see the back of it

Dr Shen, who is in charge of the boy's treatment, explained that he needed to undergo further surgery to ensure that he did not develop in an unnatural manner.

'As he grows up, and with skin growing back, it is possible that we need further rectifying operations,' he said.

'Therefore Xiang Xiang's plastic surgery will not be completed in one go. 

'There will be at least seven to ten operations to complete the basic recovery.

'At present each operation will be limited to the three-hour mark to prevent the anaesthetic from harming the child.'
