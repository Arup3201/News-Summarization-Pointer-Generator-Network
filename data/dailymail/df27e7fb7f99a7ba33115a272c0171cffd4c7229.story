Dognappers who threatened to slice up a pet pug returned him after they were named and shamed them on Facebook, the dog's owner claimed today.

Maria Smith said crooks had demanded £2,000 ransom in exchange for the safe return of Simba, who was snatched from her home in Walton, Liverpool.

But Simba was eventually returned unharmed after Miss Smith tracked down the culprits on social media websites following a Facebook appeal.

Merseyside Police said they were investigating the allegations.

After Simba went missing, the trainee beautician had taken to the Internet in a bid to track him down.

'People got in touch with me to say they had been offered my dog for sale, and that the thieves were going around asking people if they wanted to buy a dog,' she said.

When one message included the names of the alleged thieves, Miss Smith posted them on Facebook in a bid to flush them out.

'The day before I got him back, I got a phone call from one of the thieves who said "if you carry on posting on Facebook I will slice your dog apart in front of you".

'They wanted £2,000 for him and I offered them the money because I just wanted him home.

'But in the end they handed the dog back because they wanted their names off Facebook - they were worried about being identified on the internet.'

Miss Smith said two women, whom she didn't know, returned Simba to her late at night - nine days after he had gone missing.

'I have had no sleep, it's been horrible. It's heartbreaking to have a pet go missing,' she said.

'I was lucky to get my dog back. There are people who never see their dogs again after they are stolen.

'I'm overjoyed he is back. People lose their dogs every day so criminals can make a profit and something needs to be done about it.'

Miss Smith, 19, said Simba was taken from her back garden on July 22. 'I let Simba out into the back garden with my other dog, like I always do before we go to bed,' she said.

'After around 15 minutes I could hear scratching at the back door, but when I ran out there was only one dog there.

'Someone must have jumped over the back fence and taken Simba, he was nowhere to be seen.

'I was heartbroken, I have had Simba since he was eight-weeks-old and he was part of the family.

'My other dog, Junior, was crying as they normally sleep next to each other.'
