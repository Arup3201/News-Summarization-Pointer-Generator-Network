West Ham striker Diafra Sakho has been ruled out of the Africa Cup of Nations by a back problem.

Senegal manager Alain Giresse confirmed on Wednesday that Sakho would not be in his 23-man squad because: 'his back problem is preventing him from even moving'.

It is a recurrence of the complaint which first occurred on international duty in November, which enraged Sam Allardyce who claimed the injury has been 'mistreated' by the Senegalese medical staff.

Sakho has been a sensation in the Barclays Premier League since signing in the summer from Metz for £3.5million with nine goals in 15 games, although he missed a month of action with his back injury.

He came off 18 minutes from the end of a 1-1 draw against West Brom on New Year' s Day and missed the FA Cup tie at Everton on Tuesday.

Exactly how long he will be out remains to be seen but it is clear he will not join the Senegal squad for their warm-up games in Morocco and Giresse has called in Pape Moussa Konate as a replacement.

Another AfCON-related boost for Allardyce came when Alex Song announced his retired from international football after an on-off saga about his participation in the tournament with Cameroon.

Song was left out of the initial squad, then in talks to return and then ruled himself out again, taking to his Instagram account to say: 'I want to take time to focus purely on domestic football and start to rebuild my career at West Ham United.

'It is true there were some discussions to include me in the squad for this tournament but I feel after a lot of careful thought and discussions with my family that this is the right decision.'
