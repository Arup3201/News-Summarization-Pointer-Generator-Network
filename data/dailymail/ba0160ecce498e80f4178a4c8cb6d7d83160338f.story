One of the men suspected of beheading American journalist Daniel Pearl more than a decade ago has been released from a Pakistani jail.

Qari Hashim Ali, who had been detained since August 2005, walked free from the Hyderabad central jail on Friday after an anti-terrorist court said there was not enough evidence to hold him.

'It is a great victory for truth and my client,' defense counsel, Sher Muhammad Leghari said, the Indian Express reported. 'We had filed an acquittal plea... arguing that there was no evidence.'

Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal, vanished in Karachi in January 2002. A month later authorities received video footage of him being beheaded.

Killed: Daniel Pearl, pictured in an image sent to news media organizations by his kidnappers, was beheaded in 2002. On Friday, one of the suspects in his death was freed because there was not evidence to hold him

His decapitated body was found in a shallow grave in May 2002.

Hashim had been apprehended for arranging a meeting between Pearl and another of the men accused in the killing.

The mastermind behind the killing, British-born Pakistani Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, was sentenced to death in 2002 and remains in the Hyderabad Central jail in Sindh province.

His co-accused, Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Sheikh Adil, were given life sentences.

Another suspect, Saud Memon, who was accused of providing the place where Pearl was held before his death, died in mysterious circumstances in May 2007.

Court official Abdul Samih told the BBC that Justice Abdul Ghafoor Memon had ordered for Hashim to be released immediately. 

Freed: The suspect, Qari Hashim Ali, was allowed to walk free from the central jail Hyderabad on Friday

Tragic: Pearl was captured and beheaded as he researched militant groups in Karachi. One of the men accused of his death, Omar Sheikh (pictured right om 2002) has been sentenced to death

Daniel Pearl was 38 when he died. He had been investigating militant groups in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks when he was kidnapped in Karachi in January, 2002.

Days before his abduction, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy.

After he vanished, Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture.

But on February 21, 2002, a shocking video of his killing was delivered to U.S. officials in Pakistan and his remains were found in a shallow grave on Karachi's outskirts three months later.

His son was born four months after he died. 

Earlier this year, Sheikh tried to hang himself in prison, AFP reported.
