The festive getaway is a notoriously busy time on Britain’s roads.

But families planning car journeys face added misery this year – with a staggering 403 roadworks projects going on during Christmas week.

The M4, one of the main routes to and from Heathrow Airport, is the worst affected motorway with 34 scheduled works. 

While the M40, between London and Birmingham, has six planned disruptions in the lead-up to Christmas.

There will be added misery for families planning to travel during Christmas week with 403 roadworks planned

The M1, which connects London with the North, is also likely to be slow-moving in places, along with the M25, M6 and M5.

Churchill car insurance analysed data from the Highways Agency to compile a list of the roads affected. 

Of the 34 scheduled disruptions on the M4, 14 – or 41 per cent – will result in moderate delays, expected to slow motorists down by up to 30 minutes. 

A Churchill spokesman said: ‘The M4 is one of the major routes to and from Heathrow Airport and as such we suggest that drivers check traffic reports as well as allowing additional travel time if they are catching a flight before Christmas Day.’ 

The report adds: ‘Those travelling in and around London should also be aware that the M25 has 16 planned road works in the week leading up to Christmas, two of which are expected to cause moderate delays of up to 30 minutes.’

The most disrupted ‘A’ road in the UK will be the A5 with 20 disruptions of which more than half are expected to cause drivers delays of up to 30 minutes. 

The M4 will be the worst affected, with 34 scheduled works, followed by motorways - M1,  M25, M6 and M5

It urges motorists to ‘plan ahead’ and if need be seek alternative routes such as the A55 which runs parallel to the A5 in parts of Wales. 

The A12 is the second most disrupted arterial road, followed by the A1, A421 and the A34.

Lane closures are expected to be the most prevalent type of road disruption, with 173 planned lane closures between December 18 and Christmas Day. 

This is followed by carriageway closures - 134 disruptions - and width restrictions - 26 disruptions.

The M4 tops the list for the most lane closures with 21, this is followed by the M25 and M6 with 14 closures each. 

Churchill Insurance warns that anyone travelling between the Midlands and London should allow for additional time for their journey, due to the delays they may face from lane closures.

The report also notes: ‘Anyone travelling between London and Birmingham on Christmas Eve should be wary of the M40 as the motorway has four planned road disruptions which will likely cause severe delays of more than 30 minutes.'

Steve Barrett, head of Churchill Car Insurance, said: ‘Christmas is one of the few times in the year when whole families are able to get together, so at peak times, there is extra activity on the roads. 

‘Our analysis shows that there are hundreds of road disruptions planned in the week before Christmas. 

'Motorists should plan their journeys in advance and consider alternative routes, allowing more time for their travel, as there will inevitably be significant delays.' 

A spokesperson for the Highways Agency said:

'As usual, the Highways Agency will be helping drivers with their festive journeys by lifting or completing roadworks in time for the holidays. By December 23, 97.5% of our network will be free of roadworks, with 400 miles of roadworks lifted, and just 60 schemes remaining (which need to remain over the holidays for safety reasons).

'From our experience, drivers plan their Christmas trips in the week before December 25, and, traditionally, we release information on our roadworks embargo and update our website around this time. We also provide a map showing the location of each scheme which will be completed or lifted during the festive break.'
