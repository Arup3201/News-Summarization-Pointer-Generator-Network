Kelly Brook’s muscular on-off boyfriend crashed his van carrying a load of dead badgers after falling asleep at the wheel while on a controversial animal cull, it has been revealed.

David McIntosh, who is known for appearing in TV series Gladiator as ‘Tornado’, had been employed to take the dead creatures for disposal as part of the badger cull in Gloucestershire.

But as the 28-year-old former Royal Marine drove his VW Transporter van to a furnace in the middle of the night, he swerved and smashed into a bus stop, the court was told.

He claims to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the brakes, Stroud Magistrates’ Court heard.

McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29. He admitted driving without due care and attention and not having a valid licence.

Passenger John Parker - who suffered bruised ribs, thigh, face and wrist in the crash - told the court he was checking Facebook on his phone when he felt the van change direction.

Reading Mr Parker's statement, prosecutor Graham Dono said: ‘I looked up after feeling the vehicle change direction to see a bus stop.

‘I can't say if he was asleep on not, but when I looked at David both of his hands were on the wheel, but his head was on his chest. I believe his eyes were shut.’

The court heard McIntosh, of Altrincham, Cheshire, had managed to get the job as a driver despite having his licence for that class of vehicle suspended for running a red light in 2005.

Mr Parker said during the incident he shouted and grabbed the wheel, shocking McIntosh into action, who hit the accelerator and smashed into the bus shelter.

In a statement read out in court, 
McIntosh, a former Royal Marine driver said: ‘I was carrying badger 
carcasses to the furnace as I was involved in the cull.

‘The radio was always kept in the vehicle on the dashboard so we could easily hear and keep up with police as to where the protesters were. It was blocking the clutch and the brake.

'Before I retrieved it I was heading off the road. I started to brake but it was too late.’

District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai said: ‘It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted.’

Unemployed McIntosh was fined £91, plus a £20 victim surcharge and £30 prosecution costs. He was given six penalty points.

McIntosh is a British TV personality, model, bodybuilder and former ‘security operative’.

He
 has served in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland, Somalia, and the Persian 
Gulf. He was deployed to Afghanistan in October 2008 for six months.

McIntosh, who was allegedly dumped by 
Brook for being too fame-hungry - something he denies, was pictured 
together with her heading to her London bar Steam & Rye on Monday 
night.

Around a dozen anti-cull protestors attended the hearing and waved placards outside court.

They
 were angered an alleged ‘collusion’ between the police and cull workers
 via radio, and also that McIntosh was able to get a job without a valid
 licence.

Steve Tomlin, 64, 
who spent 100 nights out in Somerset and Gloucestershire during the 
cull, said: ‘Why wasn't he breathalysed? This is a case of a politically
 motivated blind spot.’

Jude
 Walker, 58, of Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting, added: ‘It 
certainly goes against what we have always been told about the police 
being even handed. And what happened to the badgers?’

The address given in court for McIntosh in Greater Manchester matches the business of his company, Next Generation Fitness Ltd.

Kelly
 has previously posed for campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment
 of Animals (Peta) - who opposed the cull. Spokesmen for McIntosh and 
Brook both refused to comment.

Natural England authorised two pilot culls of badgers, which was paid for by the farming industry.

A
 spokesman for the public body said that it issued licenses to culling 
companies which in turn employed their own marksmen. He added: ‘Daniel 
McIntosh is not a Natural England employee.'

The court heard the van was travelling from Tewkesbury to Maisemore in Gloucestershire.

McIntosh
 contacted the DVLA after the incident and was told his licence was 
revoked in 2005 for going through a red light, it was said.

His letter to the court said: 'I have had numerous hire cars and have been stopped by police for random checks and not once was it flagged up.'

District Judge Rai said: 'I have heard that this was part of the badger cull operation. I have to exclude anything to do with the badger cull. I am looking at the driving of an individual.'

Neither Mr Parker nor McIntosh were in court.

A spokesman for McIntosh said last night: 'David McIntosh was in a minor car accident last year that did not involve any other vehicles.  At the time David worked as hired security for various companies and assignments.

‘Specifically in this case, he was hired to provide secure transportation in the operation of badger culling where firearms were being used.

‘He was there to prevent any intervention as to insure the safety of staff as well as the safety of protesters by preventing any altercations.

‘David was not involved in the culling operation or process he was merely doing the job assigned to him of security and transportation.

‘David loves animals and his personal views are against the practice of culling badgers - but as an ex-military, David knows to separate between his personal beliefs and feelings to the legal task or job at hand he was hired to do.

‘The matter of the accident was resolved in court where David had to pay a fine for the traffic violation.'
