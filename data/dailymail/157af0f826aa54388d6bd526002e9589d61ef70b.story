The summer holiday getaway begins in earnest today with the prospect of the hottest days of the year next week.

Sunshine and dry weather will reign all weekend, and temperatures could hit 29C (84F) on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The school term ended yesterday in many areas and two million people are due to fly abroad this weekend. But the sudden change in the weather could lead families to book a last-minute ‘staycation’, adding to the delays on the roads.

The AA warned of major congestion, especially on routes to the South West, cross-channel ports and airports.

Jams are expected to be worst on the A303 through Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset and the M6 in Staffordshire, Cheshire and Lancashire.

After one of the dullest, wettest starts to the summer in memory, temperatures are expected to reach 20C (68F) today, 23C (73F) tomorrow and 25C (77F) on Monday in the South and East. They could hit 29C (84F) on Tuesday and Wednesday, exceeding this year’s 28.6C (83.5F) record set in Kent during a hot weekend at the end of May.

The Met Office said the downpours of the past six weeks were on the way out as the jet stream, which brought the rain clouds, moved back into a more northerly position. This will allow more traditional summer weather to arrive in most places.

The washout spring and summer may have forced many retailers to start their sales early, but at least demand for wet weather gear has been high.

The flooding on the A130/A127 junction was up to a metre deep in parts

Online retailer Amazon said: ‘There has been a 93 per cent increase in the sales of raincoats this year compared to last year. Sales of umbrellas are almost five times higher and purchases of wellington boots have increased by over 150 per cent year on year, and the bestselling brand is Hunter.’

Before the weekend - and sunshine - begins in earnest parts of the country were warned of further downpours after more overnight flooding in Essex.

Severe weather warnings were even issued for Essex after the heavy rain.

The Met Office said the mercury will 
peak at 24C (77F) on Sunday and 26C (80F) on Monday without a rain cloud
in sight, raising the possibility of a sunny start to the Olympics next
Friday. 

Tuesday could be warmer still for London and the Olympic Stadium.

It will be welcome news for the 
country, which has so far seen a dismal 45.5 hours of sunshine this 
month – a quarter of the 174.3 average, figures revealed yesterday. It 
is a gloomy contrast to July 1911, when the UK basked in an astonishing 
383.9 hours.

Yesterday saw heavy downpours restricted mainly to south east England, with a dry day for many places.

Torrential storms on Wednesday night 
in East Anglia saw city centre streets deluged in Norwich, and several 
traffic collisions blamed on the blinding rain.

Up to 20mm – a week’s worth of rain – 
was predicted to hit Kent and Essex last night, but only scattered 
showers were reported elsewhere.

Today will be cloudy and overcast for 
many areas, with rain showers possible for most places in the morning 
and early afternoon but no heavy downpours expected.

But the good news is that from 
tomorrow, it will be dry and sunny, with the summery spell lasting up 
until at least Tuesday if not longer, according to forecasters.

Dan 
Williams at the Met Office said the now infamous jet stream – the 
high-altitude belt of wind blamed for the recent  bad weather – is on 
the move and by tomorrow will be back in its normal position for this 
time of year.

He said: ‘It’s going to be a lot 
better this weekend, lasting right up until Tuesday, with dry and sunny 
weather for most of England and Wales and pretty decent temperatures.

‘Scotland and Northern Ireland will 
see wetter and windier conditions this weekend because the jet stream 
moving north to where it should be at this time of year, and taking the 
weather with it.

‘It’s been moving for the last couple of days but is almost in its normal position

'However, the long-overdue summer 
weather is not likely to quite reach the heights it did at the end of 
May, when the mercury peaked at 28.4C (83.1F) in Cornwall on May 26

But it does bring to an end the 
wettest three months on record from April to June. Britain was deluged 
for weeks, with 3,000 homes and business flooded and people swept to 
their deaths.

The flood and storm damage in June 
alone is estimated to have cost insurers £500million, according to the 
Association of British Insurers.

Already this month, the rainfall has hit 71.8mm – above the typical 69.6mm July average.

The warm weather should hold on for long enough to give a fine day next Friday. After this, forecasters said it is too early to know for sure whether the sun will stay for the Olympics.

When London last hosted the Games, in 1948, the country basked in temperatures as high as 33C (91F).
