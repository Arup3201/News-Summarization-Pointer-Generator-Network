A dangerous legal high called speckled cherry is set to be banned after being linked to 37 deaths in the UK and more in Europe.

Home Office ministers and drugs experts want to outlaw the synthetic stimulant, also called speckled cross or green rolex, which a coroner has said is like having a serial killer on the loose.

Officially known as 4.4-DMAR, it and other legal highs are widely sold in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even pet shops.

There are calls to ban a legal high known as speckled cherry, which has been linked to 37 deaths in the UK

Home Secretary Theresa May is being urged to prohibit the stimulant, which is often sold as a 'safe' alternative to Class A party drug Ecstasy.

Speckled cherries are often in white pill-form with a cherry or cross logo, but can be bought as a white powder. They cost as little as £3 per tablet. 

So far, all the deaths have been in Northern Ireland except a 19-year-old woman in Glasgow, Scotland. 

But experts fear that if ministers don’t act urgently, the substance will soon be costing lives in England.

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which advises the Government on classifying narcotics, also recommended banning a second legal high called MT-45.

Although it has not been found yet in the UK the drug, which imitates the drowsy effects of opium, has been blamed for 28 deaths in Sweden in just nine months.

The panel said both substances should be categorised as Class A drugs, which carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison for possession or life behind bars for supply.

Professor Les Iversen, chairman of the ACMD, said the drugs were lethal and posed ‘serious dangers’.

Legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of Class A drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy. 

But they are not outlawed because they do not have the same chemical compositions as the substances they mimic.

Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts and marked ‘not for human consumption’ to try to skirt the law.

Police cannot stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited.

Last month the Home Office said it was considering a blanket ban on the sale of 'legal highs' being sold on the high street.

The drugs are no longer the preserve of specialist 'head shops', and are now widely for sale in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even pet shops.

Recently released figures show there were 60 deaths related to legal highs last year - up from 52 in 2012 and 29 in 2011.
