England's first shooting gold at Glasgow 2014 went to David Luckman and Parag Patel in the Queen's Prize pairs on Saturday.

The duo, both 38, led from start to finish in the two-day event, in which shooters with full bore rifles fire at targets at distances of up to 1,000 yards.

For Luckman, of Bristol, it is a first Commonwealth medal while Patel, an ear, nose and throat specialist in London, won his third medal in the discipline.

Despite a torrential rainstorm which threatened to see the event held over until Sunday, they beat Canada's Jim Paton and Des Vamplew into second place while Scotland grabbed another medal, Ian Shaw and Angus McLeod taking bronze.

Northern Ireland's David Calvert, at 63 years of age competing at his 10th Commonweath Games, finished ninth with partner Jack Alexander.

The Queen's Prize discipline is event is unique to these Games outside of its spiritual home in Bisley, and is so called because in 1860 Queen Victoria gave the inaugural winners £250.

To this day winners still receive £250 but, unfortunately for Luckman and Patel, that tradition does not apply in the Commonwealths.
