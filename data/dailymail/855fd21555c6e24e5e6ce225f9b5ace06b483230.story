This poor little pooch proves she is up for the battle as she practices to walk using splints.

Nine-week old Tuffty, who is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cross Toy Poodle, or Cavapoo for short, was born with problems that affected her back legs. 

Because her limbs folded inwards when she walked which meant she dragged her feet, she has been wearing splints on her legs and already, as this video shows, she is coming on leaps and bounds.

Tuffty is coming to terms with her problems with her back legs, but remains a confident puppy

She can run around with the best of them as she's adapting to life wearing the splints.

Tuffty needs a home with someone who has patience to help her build her strength in her legs. She has trouble getting up and down steps.

The cute dog's tail never stops wagging as you can see. As well as meeting her walking challenges head on, she is developing well with her in-house training at such a young age.

Despite her struggles, Tuffty has been described as 'just the happiest puppy' by the rescue centre

A home with someone who can be around regularly during the day would be ideal for Tuffty

The good news is, if your heart has melted after watching the video, that Tuffty is on the lookout for a new home.

Caroline Trigg, who runs Ravenswood Pet Rescue, told Mail Online: 'She has got feeling in her legs, but she just doesn't have the strength in her muscles at the moment.

'Hopefully as she gets older she will develop these and become much stronger.

'She is just the happiest puppy; she isn't in any discomfort at all, and it's great to see her walking. 

It is hoped that as she gets older, the muscles in her back legs can develop and grow stronger

'She loves children, she loves other smaller dogs, so these would be things we would like to consider when finding her a new home. And she obviously would need someone who can be around a bit in case she gets into difficulties.
