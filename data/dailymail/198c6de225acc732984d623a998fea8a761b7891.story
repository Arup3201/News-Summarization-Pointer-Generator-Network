Nicole Trunfio has hit back at claims she has been rejected from appearing on the UK version of The Face because of diva antics on set of the Australian show.

A reality show insider told MailOnline the 28-year-old model applied to star as a mentor alongside Naomi Campbell on the upcoming second season of the British show, but was rejected.

The source claimed she was 'nightmare' and 'disrespectful'  while filming the Australian series in the franchise.

But Trunfio has hit back at the allegations of her bad behaviour, saying: 'My experience on The Face has been so positive and I thank Naomi for the opportunity.'

Branded a nightmare: Producers of The Face UK have reportedly refused to cast Nicole Trunfio as a mentor on the second series of the popular modelling show after they heard of her rude and disrespectful behaviour on the Australian set

Controversial: A source close to the producers claim the 28-year-old model was demanding and difficult to work with while filming the debut series of The Face Australia

Nicole addressed the revelation she has her eye on a role on the Face UK, adding: 'I don't see myself doing more of the show in other markets but if Naomi thought I was right for any of her markets, of course I would consider it.'

Mark Fennessy CEO of Shine, the production company which makes the show rushed to Trunfio's defence saying the allegations the model was difficult to work with were untrue: 'On behalf of everyone at Shine we are shocked and appalled at these comments - they are 100 per cent totally incorrect.'

He added: 'On behalf of the production I can tell you she (Nicole) is a delightful, professional, a sweet girl that turned up on time everyday and was incredibly professional. A nicer person you could not meet.'

The insider claimed to MailOnline Trunfio had demonstrated what was considered a bad attitude on the program which had alienated not only her fellow mentors Naomi Campbell and Cheyenne Tozzi, but also the crew and the contestants.

Not concerned: Trunfio showed she was relaxed and happy in a picture on Instagram on Thursday as she had her hair and make up done

The source said: 'She was an absolute nightmare and was incredibly disrespectful.

The source claimed the situation was so bad even Trunfio's fellow mentors didn't want to spend time with the model.

'Naomi
 and Cheyenne kept well away from her, and even the models Nicole was 
supposed to mentor did not want to engage - they were willing to risk 
losing the competition just so they didn't have to be around her!'

The Perth-born beauty did not directly address the allegations of her bad behaviour, but indicated she had more than enough to do with her Australian role on the show as well as other projects.

Still got her appetite: The model posted an Instagram pic of herself enjoying dinner and a glass of wine on Wednesday night as she shrugged off rumours of a rift with her fellow mentors

She said: 'At the moment, I am concentrating on the Australian show and many projects including Trunfio Universe, my fine jewelry line.

'I don't see myself doing more of the show in other markets but if Naomi thought I was right for any of her markets, of course I would consider it.'

Fennessy said he had not spoken to anyone from the UK regarding Nicole's performance on The Face Australia.

He said: 'I have spoken with nobody in the UK and no one at Shine UK has contacted us with a steer on Nicole.’

The Shine CEO also said he knew of no feud between Naomi and Nicole: 'Not as far as I'm aware. In the heat of battle and amidst competition you are going to find there will be moments of tension.

'Naomi is a real competitor - she has been exactly the same in the UK and US productions, so there is nothing untowards about that. The thing is Nicole soldiered on and was very graceful under fire. 

'That is all part and parcel of the competition as far as I am aware - they leave it all at the door and they have a quite a cordial and professional relationship outside of that.

'I don't think they are best friends, but not too many people are best friends with Naomi after working with her.'

A US spokesperson for told MailOnline the claims about The Face UK and the model's behaviour 'sound like nonsense'.

Confrontation: The Perth born model and Naomi Campbell began fighting in the first episode of the season after they both wanted to mentor a young model

Nicole has been hitting the promotional circuit in the last week for the Fox8 show, and flew from Sydney to Perth on Tuesday, despite suffering excrutiating stomach pains and a trip to hospital.

She seems to have taken the catty remarks regarding her performance in her stride - on Wednesday night she posted a picture of herself on Instagram enjoying dinner and a glass of wine while clutching a rose.

Then on Thursday she demonstrated she was calm and relaxed while getting her hair and make up done for a photo shoot in a picture she put on social media.

However viewers of The Face Australia, which premiered on Tuesday night, will have seen the relationship between Trunfio and Campbell is tempestuous to say the least.

Notoriously temperamental Naomi stormed off set in the first episode after a run in with her fellow mentor.

Beep: The ballsy British supermodel slung an expletive at Nicole before storming off set after she took offence to some of Trunfio's comments

She and Nicole had been fighting over a young model they both wanted on their team.

What
 started as friendly competition between the ballsy British supermodel 
and the homegrown talent quickly escalated into a confrontation after 
Naomi took offence to some of Nicole's comments.

'How
 can you say that? That is so rude!' the 43-year-old shouted after the 
Australian model hinted that Naomi may not have as much time to spend 
with the young contestant as she could.

After
 demanding an apology but not getting it, the statuesque supermodel 
hurled an expletive (bleeped out by producers) at Nicole and stomped off
 set.

Trunfio told MailOnline she believed she got off on the wrong foot with the modeling veteran - kick-starting a feud that lasted throughout the filming of the series.

'Naomi misinterpreted things I  was saying,' the stunning brunette said of the incident, 'I don’t know if maybe she wanted to have a go at me, I’m not sure where it came from,'

'If she took what I said and misunderstood, well, that definitely wasn’t the intention,' she added.
