 A southwest Ohio family is searching for Sasquatch no longer.

The Spence family in Delhi Township, west of Cincinnati, says their 400-pound concrete statue of the mythical beast, which was reported stolen Saturday, has been found.

Sixty-one-year-old Ralph Spence says his two sons bought the statue for him several years ago. They affectionately call it 'Squashy.'

Found: Ralph Spence, 61, received a call from a friend saying he saw the estimated 400-pound statue nicknamed 'Squashy' in a nearby open field after it went missing on Saturday 

The note: This letter was found with Ralph Spence's prized Sasquatch when it was found in a nearby open field wearing a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap and a new sweater 

Though it started out as a practical joke, the statue became part of the family. They even dress it up for holidays.

Spence says he received a call from a friend Tuesday who saw the statue in a nearby open field. A note found with the statue poked fun at its weight, and was signed by 'the body building bandits.'

Fox reports that in the phone conversation Spence was told, 'that Sasquatch was chilling out in an open field near Pedretti and Mayhew.'

'Sasquatch is back home and appears to be in good health. During his absence, Sasquatch was given a nice sweater and Cincinnati Reds ball cap.'

Spence says Squashy is 'a legend around here in the neighbourhood.'

'Sasquatch has been reunited with his owner and it feels so good,' reads an alert sent out Tuesday from Delhi Township police.

Fox reports that the Spence family only paid $250 for the Sasquatch at a flea market but that it has a sentimental value that’s worth much more.

Spence says he is happy to have Squashy at home safe and sound and that he never intended to press charges against the person who took Squashy.

Part of the family: The Spence family dresses up the statue in different outfits for every holiday and is dressed as the Easter Bunny in this photo 

Festive: A stolen Sasquatch statue its owner says became 'part of the family' and a fun addition to holidays has been found today in a nearby field unharmed
