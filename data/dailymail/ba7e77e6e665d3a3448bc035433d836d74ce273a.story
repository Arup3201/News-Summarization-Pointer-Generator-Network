Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds has broken his silence about the terrifying moment his son attacked him before shooting himself dead last year.

He recounted how he had been feeding his horses when his son Gus, 24, awoke on November 19 - the morning after he had been turned away from state-run psychiatric care - and went outside to see his father.

'I turned my back... and he was just on me,' Deeds, 56, told CBS in an interview that partially aired on Thursday night and will air in full on Sunday.

But Deeds, who has visible scars on his from the brutal knife attack, refused to blame his 'perfect son' for the incident, and instead said the system had failed him.

Speaking out: Creigh Deeds has broken his silence about the moment his 24-year-old son Gus stabbed him last November before shooting himself dead. Scars are visible on the Virginia senator's face

'I really don't want Gus to be defined by
 his illness,' he said. 'I don't want Gus to be defined by what 
happened on the 19th. Gus was a great kid. He was a perfect son. It's 
clear the system failed. It's clear that it failed Gus. It killed Gus.'

Gus, a talented musician and top student at William and Mary, was diagnosed as bipolar when he was 21, and last November his father became worried he would kill himself.

He gained a court order to take his son to the emergency room to check him into a psychiatric ward, but the court order expired after six hours. In that time, staff had not been able to find him a bed.

So instead, he was simply sent home with his father.

'I was concerned that if he came home, there was going to be a crisis,' Deeds said.

Deeds woke up the next 
day expecting his son to be upset, but he never could have imagined the 
violent scene that followed.

'I got ready for work, and I went out to 
the barn to feed the horses, and Gus was coming across the yard and... I said, "Hey, bud, how'd you sleep?"' he recounted. 'He said, "Fine."

'I turned my 
back and... had this feed thing in my hands 
and he was just on me... He got me twice.'

In fact, Deeds suffered 10 stab wound, including those to his face.

Following the frenzied attack, Deeds stumbled into the road where he was found by a neighbor and rushed to hospital. But his son returned to the house and shot himself dead.

The full interview detailing the attack will air on CBS on Sunday.

Gus and his father were said to have had a close relationship, and he was a fixture on his dad's failed gubernatorial campaign in 2009.

Deeds returned to work at the state's General Assembly two months after the attack. He was given a standing ovation and Governor Bob McDonnell welcomed him back, saying: 'We love you'.

Deeds said he now plans to dedicate his 
public life to reforming a state mental health care system he has called
 'irresponsible' and which he blames for allowing his sick son to be 
able to come home.

He has proposed three bills 
including one that would increase the maximum time of an emergency 
custody order from the current six hours to 24 hours and an increase of 
$38 million in spending.
