Tragic: Edward De Nunzio was seven weeks into a ten-week course to train as a ski instructor when he died

A talented straight-A student died after trying to leap from one icy chalet roof to another at an exclusive Alpine ski resort after he had been drinking, an inquest heard.

Edward De Nunzio, 18, was seven weeks into a ten-week course to train as a ski instructor at the New Generation Ski and Snowboard School in Courchevel when he attempted the leap at the end of a night out with friends.

However, he suffered serious head injuries after falling down the 16ft drop when jumping from roof to roof with a friend in a 'stupid' prank on February 25.

His parents Tony - a former Asda chief executive - and Julie, who live in a £1m house in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, paid tribute to their 'bright and talented' son, who achieved five A-grades at A-Level, after his inquest.

Edward was on a gap year 
when the tragedy occurred. He had been planning to study geography at 
University College, London after gaining his grades at Bootham School in
York.

Llyr Hughes worked at the complex in the French ski resort - a favourite with celebrities - and told the inquest today that he had also been drinking when he met Edward who was on his way back from an evening with friends.

He said they climbed onto the roofs of buildings near their accommodation, and worked their way along the second floor roofs before they reached a gap.

He told Selby Coroners Court: 'I remember we did stop and I think I pointed out this was stupid. It was not something we had done before. 

'We were just trying to get back to our chalet along the roofs. I decided we were going to go for it.'

The inquest heard the gap between the pitched roofs of the buildings was around 4ft, but the roof they were jumping from was higher than the one they were trying to land on.

Llyr managed to jump the gap, landing on his hands and feet, and 'scrambled' up the roof when he heard Edward land behind him.

He said: 'I remember being surprised, turned and saw him standing up, and he just, I don't know if he lost his balance or tripped. As I turned he was standing and just toppled over backwards.'

Coroner Rob Turnbull recorded a verdict of accidental death and noted that statements from friends and family showed Edward's behaviour was 'completely out of character'.

He told the teenager's family: 'His judgement was affected with very tragic consequences. This is a terrible and tragic loss to you.'

A statement from his family said: 'We remain devastated by the loss of Edward in this tragic accident. He was a bright, talented young man, a loving son and brother.

'He brought sunshine into the lives of all those who knew him. We love Ed and miss him so much.'

The family also expressed their gratitude for the many messages of support and acts of kindness they have received since his death.
