Wheelchair racer David Weir made it a magnificent golden double tonight by powering to victory in the 1,500m roared on by 80,000 jubilant fans, some waving 'Weir Army' flags.

Just 48 hours after being crowned Paralympic champion in the 5,000m, the 33 year-old lit up the Olympic Stadium by propelling his custom-built £3,000 carbon fibre racing wheelchair to victory.

His win capped another impressive day for Great Britain at the Paralympics, which included a gold medal for archer Danielle Brown.

Brown, who refuses to take painkillers for an excruciating neurological condition said to be as painful as terminal cancer, defeated fellow Briton Mel Clarke in a tense final.

One of the 'faces of London 2012', Weir,
who has 'winner' tattooed on his arm in Japanese, punched the air with 
delight as he went on a triumphant lap of honour a flag draped around 
his shoulders.

'It's just an amazing feeling as it is the blue riband event,' Weir said. 'Every wheelchair racer wants to win the 1500m.

'I've done it twice now, so it's a great honour. I always dreamt of winning them and I've done it twice.'

A father of two, from Sutton, South London, Weir was born without the use of his legs.

He
first competed in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 as a teenager, but 
abandoned sport soon afterwards after being disillusioned by the empty 
stadiums at that games.

But
he returned in 2004 after being inspired by watching Tanni-Grey 
Thompson at the Sydney Olympics and went on to win golds in Beijing.

He has been unable to use his legs after difficulties at birth and suffered a spine injury that left him walking with calipers.

Rapid: Weir was cheered on by 80,000 spectators as he won the race in a time of three minutes and 12 seconds

Weir took the lead in tonight's race 
with 300m to go and produced a thrilling sprint finish to hold off a 
strong challenge by Thai competitor Prawat Wahoram, who took silver.

It was the perfect follow-up to Weir's success in the T54 5,000m race, which he won on Sunday night.

And it ensured he emulated his performance in Beijing four years ago, when he won Britain's only two gold medals on the track.

He could yet add to his tally at these Games, as he is due to compete in the 800m and marathon.

Weir's
success takes the total number of gold medals won by Great Britain's 
athletics competitors at this Paralympics to six - already three times 
as many as the nation won in Beijing.

By
winning two gold medals in the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, East 
London, Weir has matched the achievement of runner Mo Farah, who won the
5,000m and 10,000m titles at the Olympics.

And
the two star athletes have another thing in common - Weir's partner is 
eight months pregnant, just as Farah's was when he competed.

Triumphant: Law graduate Danielle Brown collects her gold medal after defeating Mel Clarke in a tense all-British archery final

She is the tough woman of archery who refuses to take painkillers for her condition and hates ‘sob stories’.

And yesterday, Paralympian Danielle Brown lived up to her reputation when she held her nerve to clinch a gold medal.

She defeated Mel Clarke in a tense all-British final at The Royal Artillery Barracks in front of 3,500 screaming spectators.

Law graduate Brown, 24, has reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a neurological condition that causes excruciating pain in her legs and feet, and which leaves her too weak to walk long distances.

She says: ‘On the pain scale, they say it is on the same level as terminal cancer’.

But perched upon a bicycle seat attached to a tripod, she gritted her  teeth and won the women’s individual compound by six sets to four.

Brown, who has a tattoo of the Paralympic Agitos symbol on her wrist, said she was ‘chuffed to bits’ to win at a home Games.

The world number one, from Bingley, West Yorkshire, is known by the pink floppy hat she has worn at every major competition for the past five years.

Last night, she said it was ‘crazy’ that her face would now be printed on a stamp, as will happen for all Britain’s gold medal winners at London 2012, adding: ‘I hope they have got a nice photo. I look a bit dodgy with hat hair at the moment.’

She refuses to take pain relief medication because it makes her feel ‘dizzy and sick’, but said: ‘Competing helps because when I’m focusing on shooting, and with the massive adrenaline rush that comes, I’m not focusing on the pain that I’m in.’

Coincidentally, her rival Clarke suffers from the same malfunction of the nervous system, after contracting a bone infection as a child.

But nine years ago, Clarke was also 
paralysed from the waist down and lost the sight in her shooting eye 
after contracting Lyme’s disease from an insect bite.

The
Norwich-born shooter, who celebrated her 30th birthday on Sunday, said 
yesterday: ‘I feel incredible. Danielle shot really well. We train hard 
together and we are friends, but at the end of the day, it’s a 
competition and good on her for winning gold.’

Brown, who shoots arrows at up to 200mph, has not lost at a major championship in five years.

Remarkably,
she also competes in able-bodied competitions and at the Commonwealth 
Games in Delhi in 2010, where she won a gold medal, she became the first
Paralympian to shoot for England in a non-disabled discipline.

When she was 11, she began to get searing pain in her limbs, reducing her to floods of tears daily.

Over the next five years her condition deteriorated, but doctors could not find the cause and accused her of ‘attention-seeking’.

She was unable to play conventional sports, but her father bought her archery lessons for her 15th birthday and she loved it.

She initially struggled with the word ‘disabled’ and avoided using her wheelchair at all costs as she saw it as ‘kind of like giving up’.

She said: ‘It wasn’t until I went to the Paralympics, and saw so many inspirational people and what they were achieving with their own problems that I put it into perspective.’

Brown has a first in law but said she has no intention of pursuing a legal career to ‘sit behind a desk all day’.

She is in a long-term relationship with Paralympic powerlifter Ali Jawad, 23, who was born with no legs and moved to Britain from Lebanon as a child, as his parents wanted a better life for him.

Eight years ago, Heather Frederiksen (above) was told she would never swim again following a life-changing accident that left her with limited use of her right arm and leg.

But the 26-year-old, from  Leigh in Lancashire, yesterday powered her way to a gold medal,  successfully defending her S8 100m backstroke title.

It was her second medal of London 2012 after a silver in the 400m freestyle last week and she could hardly believe her success.

‘Did it really happen?’ she asked  just moments after getting out of  the pool.

‘This means more than anyone will ever know – I’m so happy.

‘It’s unreal. Beijing was fantastic, it was my first Paralympic Games,  but this means so much.

‘To come here in front of my home crowd with everyone willing me along was absolutely fantastic.’

But her fellow British swimmer Ellie Simmonds (right) missed out on a chance of a third London gold after finishing third last night in the 50m freestyle, her weakest event.

The 17-year-old, who has dwarfism, has only one more chance of gold but she was far from dejected, declaring: ‘I’m really chuffed to get a bronze medal, I can’t believe it – it’s just going so well for me.’
