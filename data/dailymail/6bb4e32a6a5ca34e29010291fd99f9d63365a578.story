A 49-year-old New York man has died after his parachute failed to open during a skydiving jump.

Authorities say Arkady Shenker from Brooklyn landed in the backyard of a home after a skydiving accident in southern New Jersey.

The Gloucester County Prosecutorâ€™s Office says itâ€™s unclear whether the specialized parachute that Shenker was wearing during the jump around 2 p.m. Sunday opened properly.

Officials say Shenker was an experienced skydiver with more than 350 jumps.

He was wearing a 'wing suit,' which allows a skydiver to move forward while descending.

A spokesman for the prosecutorâ€™s office says that federal authorities will investigate.

Shenker was skydiving in a plane operated by Freefall Adventures in Monroe along with 15 others.

According to ABC Action News, the Dye family was in the middle of an Easter egg hunt in their backyard in Washington Township when they saw a skydiver fall into a nearby backyard.

'I saw the jumpers. Then I noticed one and he kind of looked like he wasn't conscious, he was just spinning,' Annie Marie Dye said.

The Dyes and other neighbors rushed to help Shenker, who at that stage, they say, was unconscious but still breathing. 

One neighbor told NBC that Shenker was clearly seriously injured.

'He put a dent in the ground that deep,' he said, indicating about a foot with his hands.

Emergency responders found Shenker in a yard in the 100 block of Tuckahoe Road.

He was taken to Kennedy Hospital but pronounced dead just after 3:30pm.

The Federal Aviation Administration has will investigate the cause of the accident.

In 2011, Scott Shields, the popular Mayor of Rutledge, Delaware County, died while parachuting from the same Gloucester County company; Shields was also an experienced skydiver.

Freefall Adventures continued to take skydivers up to jump just hours after the tragedy.
