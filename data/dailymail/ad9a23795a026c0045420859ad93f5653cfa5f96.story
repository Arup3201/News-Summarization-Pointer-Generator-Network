Australian rock star Chrissy Amphlett, singer in the band Divinyls who found fame in 1991 with their hit I Touch Myself, has died aged 53 after a long battle with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis.

Her husband and former Divinyls drummer Charley Drayton said Amphlett, who also acted, died in her sleep, in their adopted home of New York, surrounded by close friends and family.

'Chrissy's light burns so very brightly,' Drayton said in a statement posted on the Australian Recording Industry Association's (ARIA) website.

'Hers was a life of passion and creativity; she always lived it to the fullest. With her force of character and vocal strength she paved the way for strong, sexy, outspoken women.'

Russell Crowe, with whom Amphlett acted in the 1988 Australian production of the musical Blood Brothers, wrote on Twitter: 'Dear 
Chrissie, the last time I saw you was in the Botanic Gardens, loving 
life and reciting verse. That's how I'll remember you, your boy, R.'

Last month Amphlett was named one of Australia's top 10 singers of all time. Her cousin Patricia Thompson said: 'Our beloved Chrissy peacefully made her transition this morning.

'Christine Joy Amphlett succumbed to the effects of breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, diseases she vigorously fought with exceptional bravery and dignity.

'She passed gently, in her sleep, surrounded by close friends and family, including husband of fourteen years, musician Charley Drayton, her sister Leigh, nephew Matt, and cousin Patricia Thompson ("Little Pattie").'

Amphlett founded Divinyls with guitarist Mark McEntee in 1980 in Sydney, and quickly became the quintessential 'Aussie rock chick', famed for her aggressive, brash, pouting style, as well as her trademark school uniform and fishnet stocking costumes.

The band, originally a five-piece, recorded five studio albums between 1982 and 1996, when they split up. Their 1991 hit I Touch Myself was their biggest seller, reaching number one in the Australian charts, number four in the America and number 10 in Britain.

Drayton said his wife had expressed hope the song would serve as a reminder to all women to perform annual breast examinations.

Amphlett also acted on stage and in film, and starred alongside Oscar-winner Russell Crowe in the Australian production of the musical Blood Brothers in 1988, playing the mother of Crowe's character.

In March 2012, the singer wrote on Facebook: 'My illnesses have really exhausted this 
little body of mine that I have thrown from one end of a stage to 
another and performed thousands of shows'

In 2007 the singer announced she had multiple sclerosis (MS), and in 2010 revealed she was also fighting breast cancer.

'Unfortunately the last 18 months have been a real challenge for me, having breast cancer and MS and all the new places that will take you,' she wrote on Facebook in March 2012.

'My illnesses have really exhausted this little body of mine that I have thrown from one end of a stage to another and performed thousands of shows.'
