It's no pain, no gain for this muscular mollusc spotted practising some pull-ups.

Cheered on by his friends, the snail was put through its paces on the improvised chin-up bar, but progress was slow. 

Despite carrying around a heavy shell, the strapping snail was able to heave itself up and over the bar in an impressive feat of strength.

'Head down, chin up': Strong snail spotted practising his pull ups at an improvised home gym

Inspired by his own gym workout, Russian macrophotographer, Anatolih Evgenii, 48, decided to try the shot with his pet snails at home.

After setting up the bar using sticks inside his studio in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, the photographer spent hours waiting for the snails to get into position.

Mr Evgenii said: 'I came up with the idea of the shot after doing my own workout.

'It was extremely difficult to get the snails into position, I spent hours waiting but luckily my patience paid off.

'Snails can be very capricious creatures so they don't always do what you want.

'They are also short-sighted, they have their eyes on the end of their antennas so you have to place subjects near their eyes to get their attention.

'Luckily, they are also quite curious, it took me about 50 shots to get the perfect photographs but they turned out great.

'They are very amusing images and people have given me some really great feedback online.'
