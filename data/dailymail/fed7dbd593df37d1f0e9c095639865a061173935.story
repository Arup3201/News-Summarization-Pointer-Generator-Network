Parents and civil rights activists are furious at the new program that will allow school administrators to monitor the heart rates, exercise, and sleep schedules of students using electronic bracelets.

A school district in Long Island, New York, announced that it would be the latest addition to the list of schools using the technology to help track students' activity and fight obesity.

Unanswered questions- including which students will wear the devices, for how long, and the purpose of the gathered data- have parents concerned about the level to which the program will invade their children's privacy.

Working it out: Long Island students are going to be the latest to wear electronic monitoring watches to help track their physical activity throughout the day

Ten Polar Active monitoring bracelets 
were ordered by the Bay Shore athletic department and will be used 
throughout the district in the coming semester.

When students wear the watch-like monitors, their heart beats and motion patterns are uploaded onto hand held computers by teachers. That data is then stored into a collection displayed on a password-protected site.

Parents and teachers should have access to the site, though it is unknown how or if the identity of the chosen students will be revealed.

The system has been used in school districts in New Jersey and Missouri already, where parents and civil rights advocates were among the most vocal critics.

'When you get into monitoring people’s biological vital signs, that’s a pretty intrusive measurement,' said American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Jay Stanley.

'A program like this should only be voluntary. Nobody should be forced to reveal biological indicator,' Mr Stanley told The New York Post.

Little is known how the ten monitors- each of which cost $90- will be spread throughout the seven schools in the Bay Shore school district, or whether students will volunteer or be chosen to participate.

One parent whose child wore the device in his St. Louis elementary school said that she never gave consent and was not privy to the results, both of which she found problematic.

'I didn't even know it was going on, and I'm active in the school. We have gotten no information about the website security or where the data will go,' Beth Huebner told The Post.

When they were used in the Parkway School District in Chersterfield, Missouri, some parents were concerned that the data collected by having third, fourth and fifth graders wearing the monitors was not just being used during the school day but also during private family time.

'I feel they're getting into privacy issues, into people's personal lives, when they have to be worn at home,' said parent and the parent-teacher organization president Cara Bauer.

'That kind of makes me a little leery, and though I think the monitors are a fantastic idea in school, I don't want that at home,' Ms Bauer continued.

By displaying the childrens' heart rates and showing how little or much they are active throughout the day, proponents argue that it promotes an interest and awareness of their own efforts.

'Heart Rate Monitors play a crucial part in how physical educators can not only assess in their classes, but how we educate students about how their bodies react to everything they do,' said Hank Speerstra, a Polar representative.

'Having data that drives how we create our curriculums is critical to helping students learn how to take care of themselves,' he continued while talking about the New Jersey program.

New York is ranked the 16 worst state in the country in terms of childhood obesity, with 17.1 per cent of children considered officially obese in July.

By comparison, the two other states who have used the monitors- Missouri and New Jersey- are both better off as they are ranked 31st and 21st respectively.
