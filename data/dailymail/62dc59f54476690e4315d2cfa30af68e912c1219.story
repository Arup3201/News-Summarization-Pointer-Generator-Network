Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed.

Before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, William was the country's preferred choice to be the next king.

But in a dramatic shift of mood, Charles is now considered to be the best person to take over the throne.

Popular: Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. He is pictured paying a moving tribute to 'Mummy' after Monday's Diamond Jubilee concert

Turnaround: A fortnight ago, Prince William was the favoured successor to the Queen. But since the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles is now the most popular choice. This could be because of his witty speech in praise of the Queen

The boost in Prince Charles' popularity may have been helped by his witty and emotional speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert last Monday.

His opening word – ‘Mummy’ – earned him rapturous cheers from the crowd as the Queen looked on delighted.

As he drew to a close, he led the audience in giving three cheers for the Queen, before kissing her hand affectionately and adding: ‘So Your Majesty we offer you our humble duty and with it three resounding cheers for our Majesty The Queen!’

Next generation: Just a fortnight ago, 44 per cent of people said they preferred Prince William to be the next king

Another reason could be the way in which he stood in for his father, Prince Philip, who was hospitalised with a bladder infection which caused him to miss a large part of the Jubilee celebrations.

The figures a fortnight ago revealed that 44 per cent of people preferred William to be the next king.

This was compared with 38 per cent who preferred Charles.

But since the successful Jubilee celebrations the figures have exactly reversed, according to a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times.

The last time Charles was favoured to be the successor to the Queen was in 2005.

Previously, he has struggled to shake off the perception among some members of the public that he is stuffy and pompous.

But this has gradually altered over the years, thanks largely to his ideas for reform.

He is believed to have been talking privately to aides for a number of years about a stripped-down monarchy - something which was demonstrated last week when the core members of the Royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the final day of the Jubilee celebrations.

The Queen appeared with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Just Prince Philip was missing as he was being treated in hospital for his illness.

The poll also revealed that William remains as popular as the Queen with 86 per cent of people considering them to be an asset to the royal family.

Prince Philip yesterday celebrated his 91st birthday quietly with his family after spending five nights in hospital.

He was discharged from the King Edward VII Hospital in central London on Saturday after being treated for a bladder infection.

When asked if he was feeling better, the Duke of Edinburgh replied: ‘I wouldn’t be coming out otherwise.’

Buckingham Palace said he would ‘continue his convalescence’ at home but could not confirm if he would accompany the Queen to a garden party at Sandringham tomorrow.

The Duchess of Cambridge polled 81 per cent with Prince Harry slightly behind - but still popular- on 75 per cent.

Reflecting the astonishing success of the Jubilee celebrations, 33 per cent of people said they feel more proud to be British following last weekend's events.

A total of 29 per cent also said they felt more positive towards the royal family since the Jubilee celebrations.

During Charles' popular speech last Monday, he paid tribute to ‘the life and service of a very special person’.

He told the Queen: ‘A Diamond Jubilee
is a unique and special event, some of us have had the joy of 
celebrating three jubilees with you, and I have the medals to prove it.

‘And we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years.

‘I
was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly, 
unexpectedly, you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when 
you were only 26.

‘So as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us.

‘For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.’
