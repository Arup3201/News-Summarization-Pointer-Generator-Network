Cleveland Indians pitcher Corey Kluber became the victim of his teammates' pranks last night as they pelted him with seeds, water and baby powder during an interview in the dugout.

But throughout the five-minute ordeal, he didn't even flinch.

In a hilarious show of defiance, the sportsman batted away his team's prank as he sat alone in the dugout during their game against the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday.

Under fire: Cleveland Indians pitcher Corey Kluber kept his cool as teammates pelted him with sunflower seeds as he took part in a dugout interview on Tuesday

Trooper: The team then moved on to water, soaking him as he concentrated on the interview

A few seconds after broadcasters on Fox Sports started asking him about his performance in the previous night's game, he was hit by handfuls of sunflower seeds - but he didn't even blink.

Minutes later, the water began, eventually causing him to reach for a rain jacket.

'Look at the composure of this guy, folks,' the broadcaster commented, laughing.

But that wasn't the end of his troublesome teammates' pranks, as they then grabbed the baby powder, leaving him covered.

But there were no complaints from Kluber, who remained calm and kept his focus on the interview.

Covered: 'You look like a powdered sugar doughnut!' the broadcasters told him at the interview's close

'You look like a powdered sugar doughnut now!' the broadcasters joked as they concluded their questions. 'You're a trooper. Thanks for hanging in there.'

It's not the first time the Indians have pulled pranks on each other.

On Friday, Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis videobombed teammate Mike Aviles during an MLB interview by performing jumping jacks in the background before peering into his face.

Aviles wasn't quite as cool as Kluber about the incident though - and cracked up as his teammate ran away.
