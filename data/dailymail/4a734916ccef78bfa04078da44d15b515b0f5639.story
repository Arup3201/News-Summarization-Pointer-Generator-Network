Golden years: Miss Beard has declared she wants to create an ‘old movement’ to encourage people to take pride in growing older

She has tirelessly crusaded against the prejudice older women face in today’s society.

Now Mary Beard has declared she wants to create an ‘old movement’ to encourage people to take pride in growing older.

The television historian announced yesterday that she is ‘reclaiming the word old’ in the same way ‘queer’ was embraced by the gay community.

And the 59-year-old said she hoped to rally older people into joining her in a political debate to take away the word’s negative connotations.

She said: ‘I do, partly to annoy people, say “how could you say that to an old woman like me”. I do it to reclaim the word “old”. Old instantly connotes the hunched lady or gentleman. I want an old movement. By the time I die I want “old” to be something we say about ourselves with pride.’

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said it was insulting that many people think it is a good thing to look younger.

‘I think we have to look quite hard at the vocabulary we use to talk about ourselves and our ageing,’ she said. ‘One of the things that’s most surprising is the way it’s a compliment to say “gosh you don’t look 75”. What’s the matter with looking 75?

‘Somehow to pat someone on the back for looking younger than they are is one of the weirdest examples of doublethink in our culture.’ 

Miss Beard, who is a professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, said older people are often stereotyped as grandparents rather than individuals in their own right.

She hit out at promotional images of ‘Darby and Joan off to see their grandchildren’ on senior rail card leaflets, instead of people like herself who ‘wanted to go to London’.

She added: ‘We can also have fun. We should be thinking, “I want to get my bus pass and my senior rail card and go across the country”.’

Miss Beard, who presented the BBC Two series, Meet the Romans with Mary Beard, also spoke about writer AA Gill, who was branded sexist for criticising her appearance.

Watch the full video here, this video was part of a British Academy Debate series on ageing.

Miss Beard, who is married with two grown-up children, said: ‘There’s a lot of 50-something women out there who actually like to look like a 50-something. I look like the average 50-something woman that hasn’t had the work done.’ 

Referring to the Twitter trolls who sent her abusive messages and threats of sexual assault last year, she said she benefited from the ‘unbashability of late middle age’.

And she said she is glad she no longer receives wolf whistles from builders: ‘I used to think when builders whistled at me, how crude they were. Now they seem to have got better behaved. My first reaction was, “I’m past whistling ability”. The second reaction was “Yippee”!’
