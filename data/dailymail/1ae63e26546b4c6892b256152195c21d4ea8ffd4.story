Boris Johnson is at war with Michael Gove after the Education Secretary privately backed George Osborne as  the next Tory leader, it is claimed today.

The Mayor of London’s supporters are ‘obsessing’ about who will succeed David Cameron and have launched a ‘whispering campaign’ against Mr Gove, according to The Spectator magazine.

There is said to have been a ‘furious eruption’ from Mr Johnson’s camp after it heard reports that the Education Secretary told newspaper proprietor Rupert Murdoch over dinner that he would prefer Mr Osborne to take over when Mr Cameron steps down.

The Chancellor’s supporters in Westminster believe his chances of becoming Conservative leader - largely written off a year ago - are increasing as the economy recovers and his reputation is enhanced.

Mr Gove has repeatedly insisted that he will not stand for the job and is said to have ‘hitched his star’ to that of Mr Osborne.

Mr Cameron is said to have decided that the Education Secretary should be deployed to ‘keep Boris in his box’.

One minister familiar with the strategy said: ‘Michael is licensed to sink his teeth into Boris’ ankles in a way that neither the boss nor George can.’

Mr Gove is said to have taken to his role as ‘licensed bear-baiter’ with ‘gusto’.

He and Mr Johnson had clashed over education policy, with the Education Secretary refusing to agree to the Mayor’s demands for more power over London schools.

‘There have been some genuine tensions over education. But it doesn’t account for all this madness,’ one friend said.

Another supporter of the Education Secretary said: ‘If Boris’s lot think Michael is sitting in the Department for Education with maps on the walls, working out how to stop Boris, they’re mad.’

One Tory minister, who has regular dealings with the Mayor, said the row ‘reveals that Boris doesn’t have enough to do’.

The Mayor is also said to have been spending time courting Tory donors, arguing that he is the only politician who can successfully defend them from wealth taxes.

Big battle: It supposedly stands between George Osborne and Boris Johnson in the next leader's election for the Conservative Party

It emerged earlier this month that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are trying to persuade Mr Johnson to stand as an MP in 2015 so that he is fully bound in to the election result.

The Mayor’s allies insisted it was ‘bull****’ that the Chancellor had already personally delivered him a message saying that he should attempt to return to the Commons next year.

It has been widely assumed that Downing Street would be against a 2015 Commons comeback, since it would suggest Mr Johnson wanted to be in place to challenge for the leadership because he expects Mr Cameron to lose the election and be ousted as party leader.

But a close ally of the Prime Minister told the Mail that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne were ‘telling Boris to stand’ and ‘own this campaign as much as anyone else’. There has even been speculation that Mr Johnson could be offered a formal campaign role, even the party chairmanship - an offer that would be difficult to turn down.

Mr Johnson’s supporters saw the intervention as an attempt to call his bluff and prepare the ground in case he does decide to stage an early return to the Commons.
