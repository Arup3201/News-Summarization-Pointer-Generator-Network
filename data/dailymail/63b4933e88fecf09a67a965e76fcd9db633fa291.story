This office may be the most fun in Britain as it comes kitted out with a giant helter skelter slide, a tree house and even a pub.

The unique workplace also boasts a pool table, a putting green, a giant swing and a cinema.

Office designers Space & Solutions were tasked with turning a former pub in Southampton into the home for IT company, Peer 1 Hosting.

This office may be the most fun in Britain as it comes kitted out with a giant helter-skelter slide

Their design brief was to transform the 17,000sq ft office into 'the best place in the UK to work.'

Lead designer Sarah O'Callaghan said fun and play was at the heart of the vision. She said: 'It is a very young and forward thinking company. The whole space has been designed with the help of the staff.

'There was a huge consultation process that has been amalgamated into what we see here. I think there are times when people use their initiative a hell of a lot more because of their environment.

'If you don't feel comfortable sitting at a desk you can sit on a picnic bench. The reality is that you can do your work from anywhere.'

And when hopeful jobseekers turn up for an interview, they may have to throw themselves down the giant slide to show they buy into the culture.

Swinging: There is even a swing in the middle of the office if staff want to take a break. Here the firm's managing director Dominic Monkhouse has a go

Unusual: Staff members can also relax with a game of pool at the office designed by company Space & Solutions who were tasked with turning a former pub into the home for IT company, Peer 1 Hosting

Mrs O'Callaghan added: 'People use it all the time. It is not just for staff, it is for clients too. It is also part of the interview process. If they don't go down it, they are not buying into the culture of the business.'

The unique new office is fittingly situated on the end of a pier. Dominic Monkhouse, managing director at Peer 1 Hosting, said anyone can use the facilities whenever they like.

He said: 'We are trusting. Everyone is a peer rather than a parent and child relationship. But while mucking around on a slide may seem like skiving off, the company believes it actually boosts productivity.

He added: 'People tend to go through 
highs and lows throughout the day, but if you do something different for
a few minutes, your performance goes up.'

Bar: No need for staff to go down the pub at lunchtime as the office boasts its very own bar

Quiet space: The office even has a tree house where staff members can take some well-earned down time

As well as laying on fun activities, 
the office has plenty of places for staff to have a quiet moment when 
work gets on top of them.

This
includes a coffee bar, a 'chill out' space, log cabins and a pub called
The Sherlock Arms, named after the company's founder, Gary Sherlock.

The
office also comes with two flats to host overseas guests, an outdoor 
terrace and an inside garden, complete with a 15ft tree and picnic 
benches. Humour is also a key factor in the office as it features a 'Cock Up of the Month' board.
