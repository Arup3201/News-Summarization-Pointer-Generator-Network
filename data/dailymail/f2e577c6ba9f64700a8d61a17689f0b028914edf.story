Killed: Aaron Tuneberg, 30, pictured, was brutally beaten at his Boulder home in Colorado for his Xbox

Two teenage boys have been charged with first degree murder after they allegedly beat a mentally disabled man to death with a baseball bat and golf club for his Xbox console.

Austin Holford and Luke Pelham, both 18, were in court on Monday to face charges after the brutal assault on 30-year-old Aaron Tuneberg in Boulder, Colorado. 

Prosecutors upgraded those charges to murder today after Mr Tuneberg died.

Police claim the pair beat the 30-year-old vicitm unconscious during the robbery of his Xbox at his home on March 31.

The victim's family gave a statement to Daily Camera, which read that the 30-year-old was 'vulnerable, innocent and unable to discern danger'.

They added: 'Our family is devastated by this 
senseless tragedy.

'We want you to know that at the heart of this is a 
wonderful man named Aaron, who is a beloved son, brother and uncle.'

It was originally claimed by the defendants that Holford hit the victim with an aluminum bat while Pelham stood watch outside with a golf club.

However forensic experts said on Monday that Mr Tuneberg's wounds revealed that he had also been hit with the club. 

According
 to their arrest affidavit, Pelham said Holford wanted to carry out the robbery to get money so they could leave Boulder.

They are now charged with first-degree felony murder and second-degree murder with a deadly weapon.

Both men were in court on Monday for the custody hearing. Pelham's bond was set at $100,000 while Holford, who already has a juvenile conviction for assault, was set at half a million dollars.

Pelham's attorney Benjamin Collett said that his client suffers from Klinefelter syndrome, leaving him with the mental capacity of a young boy so jail would be incredibly damaging.

Mr Collett said his client's condition would have also made him easy to exploit and that his client eventually called the police to Mr Tuneberg's apartment.

The attorney said that his client was convinced to take part after Holford told him that Mr Tuneberg had assaulted his girlfriend.

The pair were arrested a short time after the robbery sleeping in a van a few streets away.
