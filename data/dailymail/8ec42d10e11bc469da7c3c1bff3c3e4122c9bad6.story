She's well-known for carefully curating her outfits for her royal outings and today was no different.

Queen Letizia of Spain, 42, had clearly thought long and hard about her dress for a visit to a winery on Thursday, looking resplendent in an appropriate Rioja shade. 

The Chanel-esque tweed number flattered her petite frame and was accessorised with red court shoes, a peach clutch bag - a style she favours - and dazzling drop earrings.

The style chameleon wore her hair up for a change, twisted into a low plaited bun, and added some colour to her beauty look with a slick of red lipstick.

The mother-of-two and her husband, King Felipe, posed beside a barrel of cava that they had autographed on a prior visit, during their trip to Freixenet winery in the north-eastern Spanish Catalonian village of Sant Sadurni d'Anoia.

The Spanish monarchs were helping the company celebrate its centenary.

Freixenet, a global leader in traditionally-made quality sparkling wines, is celebrating the 100-year anniversary of its first cava (sparkling white or rose wine). 

The company is run by the same family that produced the first bottle one century ago, and remains a leader in exports, selling 150 million bottles in more than 140 countries all over the world.

The couple have had a week off public duties and were last seen on February 4, when they attended a meeting with members of The Royal Theatre Foundation at the Royal Palace. 

Guests at the event included Esperanza Aguirre - a Spanish politician and former President of Madrid - and the Peruvian writer, Mario Vargas Llosa.
