Veteran DJ Tony Blackburn, who claims that listeners prefer to hear men's voices on the radio

Veteran DJ Tony Blackburn has claimed listeners prefer to hear male voices on the radio and that there are too too many women in presenting slots.

His comments come after earlier this week it was announced BBC Radio 5 Live were to replace long-time presenters Victoria Derbyshire and Shelagh Fogarty, while Adrian Chiles, Peter Allen and Dan Walker were to join.

This is despite the BBC Trust warning the station two years ago that it must do more to attract a ‘more even balance’ of listeners but only one hour a week at 5 Live will now be solely anchored by a woman.

But the 71-year-old broadcaster defended the BBC's decision saying he believes there are 'quite a lot of women' on the radio.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'During the day women have always preferred the voices of men. I have no idea why.

'There is nothing to stop women coming into broadcasting.

'There are loads on BBC Radio 2. If you look at the news channels, they are all women. I don't think there are enough men on.'

The BBC also said that three out of seven of their daytime presenters were female and that they would continue to be 'champions of strong female voices on the radio'.

Last Saturday, Blackburn had to stand in to provide cover when Graham Norton failed to turn up to present his morning show on BBC Radio 2.

Norton, 51, who is paid £2.3million by the BBC, had been pictured the night before partying with celebrities including Nigella Lawson and Elizabeth Hurley.

But Blackburn, who presents a show after Norton’s, said: ‘I think he overslept and thought it was Friday. It was something like that. I am always very early so I was there to stand in.’

The Irish star's production team had to struggle on with the three-hour programme when he didn't make the 10am start.

However, Norton seems to have recovered quickly, as he was seen walking his dogs in the early afternoon. The evening before the show he attended a party with TV chef Nigella Lawson

Maria McErlane, the co-presenter of the programme's Grill Graham problem spot, ended up carrying much of show on her own.

McErlane said on-air: 'Fear not, Graham isn't taking hormones. It's Maria McErlane, his old mucker. 

'I'm standing in because I fear he has been delayed slightly. But fear not he will be here.'

Anxious fans only found out the Eurovision Song Contest presenter had 'been up all night being sick' two hours into the show.

The failure to explain Norton's absence led to speculation online that the 51-year-old had gone to Glastonbury or last week's Gay Pride in London. 

A Radio Five Live female presenter, who is to leave her afternoon show has defended the BBC against gender bias.

Shelagh Fogarty, a former co-presenter of 5 Live's breakfast show with Nicky Campbell said it shouldn't be the case that a job held by a woman should then be filled by another woman.

Fogarty, 48, said she would spend the summer ‘exploring a number of opportunities, before deciding what’s next’.

The broadcaster, who had been with 5 Live for 15 years told The Guardian: 'I don't think it would be a good thing if every time a controller made a decision he or she said it must be a woman.

'Would they have been right to choose a woman just so it looked right, even though they didn't feel that woman was right for the job?

'I really don't feel affronted, as a feminist, that every job a woman has isn't then filled by another woman.
