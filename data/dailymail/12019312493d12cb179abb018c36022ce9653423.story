Victim: The 16-year-old accused of murdering teacher Ann Maguire has 'accepted responsibility' for her unlawful killing but will face trial in November

The sisters and brother of Ann Maguire were in court today to watch the teenager accused of her murder admit he stabbed the teacher to death in front of her class.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared via video-link at Leeds Crown Court and 'accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing'.

He is accused of murdering the 61-year-old teacher at Corpus Christi Catholic College, in Leeds, in April.

No pleas were entered but Richard Wright QC, defending, said: 'He has accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing of the deceased'.

A trial on the murder charge is scheduled for November.

The teenager appeared on two video screens in the packed courtroom and Mrs Maguire's  sisters Denise and Shelagh, and brother James watched from the public gallery.

The boy was wearing an orange T-shirt with blue trousers and spoke twice - to confirm his name as the 10 minute long hearing began, and to acknowledge he understood what was happening, when the judge asked him at the end.

Members of Mrs Maguire's family watched the proceedings from the public gallery.

Mr Wright, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, and the judge, Judge Peter Collier QC, all sat in court without their normal robes.

The court heard that expert psychiatric reports would now be prepared before the trial.

Mr Wright said: 'The defendant accepts that he unlawfully killed Ann Maguire.

'The issue in the case will be whether or not a partial defence is available to him.'

Mr Greaney said: 'It does not amount to an admission he is guilty of murder. It does amount to an admission he's guilty of manslaughter.'

Tragedy: Ann Maguire's death shocked the world and was the first time a teacher was stabbed to death in a classroom 

Both the judge and Mr Greaney asked the public to be extremely careful about using social media to discuss this case and stressed there could be heavy penalties for naming the defendant or other details about the case ahead of the trial.

Mrs Maguire's death was the first time a teacher has been stabbed to death in a British classroom and the first killing of a teacher in a school since the 1996 Dunblane massacre.

She first went to Corpus Christi as a student teacher and last year the school held a celebration of her 40 years of service.

This year, she had moved to working four days a week ahead of her planned retirement.

Mrs Maguire, who was head of Year 11 at the school for more than 10 years, lived in the Moortown area of Leeds with her husband, Don, who is a former maths teacher and landscape gardener.

The teenager was told he will appear again for a hearing on September 26. He was remanded in custody.
