He is not known for any expressions of self-doubt.

But Clive James has finally said he  is ‘sorry’ for cheating on his wife of  44 years – admitting that he is ‘a  reprehensible character’ and ‘a terrible husband’.

The 72-year-old critic and broadcaster even revealed that he ‘admires’ his  wife, the academic Prue Shaw, for having the courage to kick him out of  the family home after discovering his eight-year affair. 

'She's annoyed': Clive James, pictured with his wife Prue Shaw, in 2008, says he still loves her and that he regrets being unfaithful

James, who is battling leukaemia, said: ‘My wife is very angry with me, so the situation is fluid. I deceived her and she’s annoyed.

‘She is not just within her rights, she is perfectly justified and I not only understand but I admire her.

‘I’d like to say I love my wife and family very much and I am sorry that I have behaved so badly. I have great respect, admiration and love for my wife.

‘I am a reprehensible character who needs to clean up his act. But I have already done a few things that may have justified my existence and, given time, I would do more.

‘I don’t think I was a bad father but I was a terrible husband, much to my regret.

‘I deserve everything that has happened to me.’

'Instant attraction': Former model Leanne Edelsten opened up about her eight-year affair with Clive James on Australian television in April

In April it was revealed that 
Sydney-born James had enjoyed an eight-year affair with Leanne Edelsten,
a twice-married former model and Australian socialite.

Speaking
of their romance on Australian television, the 48-year-old claimed she 
and James had their own bedroom rituals, including drinking a cup of tea
and eating a Cherry Ripe chocolate bar before making love.

She also described how she had nicknamed him Mr Wolf because of the way he ‘ravished’ her, while he called her ‘Miss Hood’.

And
she told how they met in a Sydney restaurant in  2004 while she was 
still  married to an Australian barrister. She divorced her first 
husband, Dr Geoffrey Edelsten, in 1988.

She said: ‘We had an instant attraction. He was his formidable, funny, witty self. He just walked to the table and said: “In my opinion all intelligent women talk with their hands”.

‘He was flirting, complimenting, a very open guy. The  guy’s hysterical. He made me laugh from the word go.

‘He has always been and always will be “Mr Wolf”...because our initial, how can I say it, our initial liaison, he devoured me.’

Mrs Edelsten said James confessed the affair to his wife after she confronted him with a string of their secret emails, along with photographs of his lover in bikinis and underwear.

Miss Shaw, the mother of his two children, then banished him from their home in Cambridge, forcing him to live in a London flat.

When asked if she felt sorry for Miss Shaw, Mrs Edelsten said: ‘No. I know he’s been busted. There will be comments, but that’s if there’s a home to wreck.’

The writer – who in June  said he was  ‘getting near the end after several years of serious illness – is currently moving back to Cambridge to be nearer Addenbrooke’s Hospital, where his cancer is being treated.

However, the Mail revealed last week that he has been forced to find his own accommodation because Miss Shaw will not allow him back into her home.

A source said: ‘It’s the first time Clive has had to live on his own and he is rather down in the dumps and worried.’ 

James previously denied allegations of adultery in 2009, when opera singer Anne Howells claimed he had had an affair with her in 2005.

He once claimed that he had a ‘strict code of practice’ in his marriage: ‘Look but don’t touch.’
