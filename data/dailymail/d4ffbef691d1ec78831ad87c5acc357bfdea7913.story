I have been thinking about getting jowl surgery — but before I take that step, I wondered if there was a clever way of disguising the skin with make-up? I’ve never had any cosmetic procedures and haven’t had my make-up done professionally for 30 years.

Avril, 69, Surrey.

Contouring is a make-up technique creating light and shadow using highlighter and darker powder — and it can have magical results.

It adds volume where there is none, reveals cheekbones you didn’t know you had and gives the illusion of lift to the bits that need it.

Even though I have watched top make-up artists do it, I still struggle with contouring, often ending up with a face that simply looks dirty.

As we get older our skin can sag, especially on the cheeks, around the mouth and on the chin and neck, so highlighting can add lift and structure to the face.

Avril was keen to try it, so using the new Rodial Instaglam Compact Deluxe Contouring Powder, £52, make-up artist Gemma Wheatcroft gave her a lesson.

Contouring works best if your base is even and dewy. More mature skin tends to be dry, so use a primer over your face and neck first. Try something like No 7 Instant Illusion Airbrush Away Primer.

Gemma suggests using a highlighting pen and drawing a ‘V’ shape underneath the eyes to brighten dark circles. This makes the cheeks look more youthful and shifts the focus up the face away from the jowls. Gosh Click’N Conceal in Light, £6.99 (Superdrug) provides the best results.

THE TRICKY BIT

If you are using contour powder, a good brush is essential. Gemma used Rodial’s contouring brush, £40, which has a diagonally sculpted head that sits perfectly under the cheekbone.

A quick tip to find this perfect place to apply powder is to suck in your cheeks to make a ‘fish face’. It will help to show the natural shadow beneath your cheekbones.

To make the jowls and a double chin look less noticeable, apply the contour powder in a semi-circular shape, taking it from the hollows of your cheeks to under the jawline.

FINISHING TOUCHES

Once you have finished the sculpting, you need to bring an element of warmth back into the skin. Gemma suggests dusting bronzing powder on to the areas on the face that sunlight would naturally hit — the temples, cheeks, nose and chin — in a swirling figure of eight. Try Avon Glow Bronzing Powder, £10 (avonshop.co.uk).

For a final touch, add a light dusting of illuminating powder to the cheekbones, down the centre of the nose and on the Cupid’s bow. This creates a luminous finish, which helps define features and add a youthful glow to the skin.

VERDICT

After: Avril (pictured) was thrilled with the results of make-up artist, Gemma Wheatcroft's, lesson

Avril was delighted with the result. Two weeks later, I asked her how she was getting on.

‘Last Tuesday evening I was at a meeting and one of the attendees said to me: ‘Avril, you look different. What have you been doing?’

‘I didn’t let on, but said I have been using new make-up. I will persevere with the regime and hopefully I won’t need any additional help.’

ELSA'S PICK

Bristle Brush, from £24

The right hairbrush can make all the difference to your hair. I love the Bristle Brush, which is lightweight, with a wooden barrel to absorb the heat. The bristles stimulate blood flow on the scalp, promoting hair growth. From £24 (thebristlebrushcompany.com). 

Miss Dior Hair Mist, £34

Miss Dior was the first bottle of scent I owned. My dad bought it on his way back from a business trip and I still remember how sophisticated it made me feel. Its feminine, floral scent, with rose, patchouli, musk and citrus, has become a world favourite. Dior has now created Miss Dior Hair Mist, £34. This light fragrance refreshes hair and helps protect it from pollution.

Pure Super Grape Glow Mask, £12

This new treatment — Pure Super Grape Glow Mask, £12 (Marks & Spencer) — includes Cornish clay from St Austell, which is excellent for removing impurities.

Apply a thick layer and leave for ten minutes, then remove with warm water. Use twice a week to see skin significantly brightened.
