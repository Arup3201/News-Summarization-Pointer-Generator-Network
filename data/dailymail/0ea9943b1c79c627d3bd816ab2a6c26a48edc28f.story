Prince Harry’s naked high-jinks in Las Vegas may have cost him his latest girlfriend.

Model Cressida Bonas, 23, a Leeds University graduate who has been dating the Prince over the summer, is said to have been ‘humiliated’ by the pictures of Harry enjoying the company of a young blonde in a hotel room.

Although sources say the couple have not split up, Ms Bonas, who has seen the pictures of the naked Prince on the internet, has hinted that she wants some time out.

'He's ruined his chances now.' a friend of the heiress is quoted today.' Harry has blown it. Cressida saw a future with him, but he clearly isn't as serious about her as he claimed to be.'

Her torment was revealed as it emerged that one of the women who partied with the Prince on the 63rd floor of the Wynne Las Vegas and Encore Resort Hotel is set to 'tell all' on American TV in 'the next few days.'

Ms Bonas, the daughter of Sixties cover girl and banking heiress Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, enjoyed a holiday with Harry on Necker, the island owned by Sir Richard Branson, shortly before his jaunt to ‘Sin City’.

Together with a group of friends, they were on Necker to celebrate the 27th birthday of Sir Richard’s son, Sam.

Ms Bonas is said to be ‘less than impressed’ by the pictures that have emerged from the boys-only break in Las Vegas.

Photos
of Harry naked and bear-hugging a nude blonde in his private suite have gone viral on the internet since they were
published on the American website TMZ.

During the Necker holiday, the Prince and Ms Bonas were acting very much as a couple, according to friends.

One told the Sunday Mirror: 'They had been for a few dates including one just before Necker. Things went further there between them and they had a great time fooling around.

'Everyone in their group thought they were getting it on. Cressida definitely saw the romance asa goer and is gutted by what happened.'

 A friend of Ms Bonas told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The relationship was pretty low key to begin with, but some of Cressida’s friends say it won’t get off the ground now,’

‘Cressida is pretty peeved.’

She and Harry were introduced by Harry’s cousin, Princess Eugenie.

Last month they attended a screening of the new Batman movie where they were reportedly spotted in a clinch and they were recently seen at the Womad music festival in Wiltshire.

Yesterday, the U.S. media firm Bad Girlz PR claimed that a woman at the Prince's party was prepared to reveal what happened that night and to take a lie detector test to back her version of events.

The woman, from California, has hired a PR who acts as a go-between for people who have intimate stories about celebrities and want to go on the record.

A spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: 'What she says is quite incredible and paints a different side to the prince and his behaviour.'

But the spokesman added that the woman is 'nervous' about coming forward because she fears a royal backlash.

A spokesman for Prince Harry declined to comment last night.
