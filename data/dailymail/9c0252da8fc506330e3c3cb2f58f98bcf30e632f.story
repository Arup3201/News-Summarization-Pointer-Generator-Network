A soldier returning home from Kuwait was given a welcome home he will never forget.

Faithful pet Buddy can barely contain himself when he realises his owner has finally returned.

The touching reunion was captured on camera by the soldier's wife Kristin Staggs, who uploaded it to YouTube.

The touching reunion between Buddy and his soldier owner was caught on camera by wife Kristin Staggs

Buddy goes bounding towards his owner, who crouches down to meet him

The happy dog then rolls around on the grass as he is petted by the returned soldier

The video begins with Mrs Staggs telling their pet that someone was waiting to see him outside.

She then films as she lets the dog outside, who then goes wild as he rushes towards the kneeling soldier.

Buddy whines and barks with excitement as his owner tells him how much he has been missed.

The dog jumps on the soldier, runs around in circles and then between his two owners in sheer excitement.

With his tail wagging, Buddy and the soldier then play fight on the grass of the front yard. 

Mrs Staggs said from behind the camera as she filmed: 'He is so happy to see his daddy.'

Buddy is so excited that he runs back and forth between the couple

She wrote: 'Every day since my husband left at 6:30 pm, Buddy would look out the window to see if his daddy was coming home. He is one happy dog now :)'
