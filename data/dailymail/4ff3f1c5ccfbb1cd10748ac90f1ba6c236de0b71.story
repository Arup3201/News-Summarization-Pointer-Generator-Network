A Georgia teenager left destitute after his parents kicked him out of home for being bisexual has been overwhelmed after strangers online raised more than $20,000 towards helping him get his life back on track.

Nick, an 18-year-old freshman at Kennesaw State University, was left reeling last month after his step mom and father told him never to return to the family’s home in Marietta after someone informed them that he was bisexual.

Not only was Nick left homeless, but his parents left all his stuff in the front yard and told him to come pick it up before it got stolen.

When Nick showed up to collect his 
belongings, the police were on hand and he claims that officers 
threatened to arrest him if he came back.

Then while the teen was at work as a bag boy at a local supermarket, his parents came and took away his car. He maintains that even though the vehicle was registered in their name, it was he who made the monthly payments for it. 

As if all that wasn't bad enough, his parents even withdrew all his savings which they were able to do because his bank accounts were ‘custodial accounts’.

Fortunately for Nick, a woman who works with him was there in his hour of need and has allowed him to sleep on her couch since.

The woman’s son-in-law Steve Bevers then set-up a crowd funding page on October 22 to help raise money for the freshman and to show him that even if his parents didn’t love him there were others who did.

‘We have taken him in, and are committed to keeping him on track. But he will need to find a place to live soon (He is welcome on our couch as long as he needs, but everyone deserves a bed to call their own) and a car to help him get around,’ reads a message from Bevers on the GoFundMe page.

‘Had his parents not emptied his accounts, he could have paid a deposit, got into an apartment, and found a new car, but he was left with nothing.’

'We're working to show Nick that he is loved, even by strangers,' he added. 'That the horrible acts of some people will not be enough to stop him, and that with the help of people everywhere, he can get through this.'

The results have been extremely encouraging and in just 12 days more than 600 people have raised over $21,000 for Nick.

The teen has been overwhelmed by the support he has received and on October 24, he uploaded a video to tell supporters his story and offer his thanks.

In the video he revealed that he did not choose to tell his father and stepmother about his sexuality because of how they would respond.

‘This whole thing started when my stepmom caught wind of me being bisexual,’ he said. ‘I don't know where she got her information from, but I know it wasn't from me.

'She didn't like that and neither did my dad. I got told some very vulgar and disgusting things... That's why I didn't tell them, because I wasn't ready. And I didn't tell them for the exact reaction I was scared about, and that's exactly what happened.’

In a second video uploaded last Wednesday, Nick revealed that he is trying to get registered for the spring semester of school and is hoping to put some of the donation money toward getting himself a car.

‘You guys pretty much saved my life,’ he said to those people who have already donated to the crowdfunding effort.
