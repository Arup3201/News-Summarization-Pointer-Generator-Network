Error: The Money Shop's parent company Dollar Financial accidentally gave more than 6,000 customers loans they couldn't afford due to a systems glitch

Britain's second biggest payday loan giant has agreed to refund more than £700,000 to customers after admitting it gave out loans that people could not afford.

Dollar Financial, which was trading as The Money Shop, will refund interest on the loans, plus any default charges imposed because customers missed repayments.

However, there will be no further compensation, while the finance giant, which is responsible for one in four payday loans, will not face any fines.

Details were announced by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which said Dollar has also promised to order an independent review of the way it lends money.

The problems occurred because of a computer ‘systems error’ and relate to loans to some 6,247 customers which were made between January 2013 and April this year.

The StepChange Debt Charity welcomed the FCA announcement, but warned rogue payday loan firms have failed to deliver on promises to treat customers fairly.

The charity’s head of policy, Peter Tutton, said: ‘Despite the payday lending industry’s repeated assurances that it was lending responsibly and that poor practice was a thing of the past, we have continued to see thousands of cases where people have been trapped in unsustainable and unaffordable cycles of high-cost borrowing, as loans are rolled over and borrowers take on multiple debts.

‘Today’s announcement is further evidence that payday loan companies have failed to act in the best interests of borrowers.’

The news raises new questions about the failure of payday loan giants, which impose sky-high interest rates backed up with punishing penalty fees, to offer fair treatment to customers.

The biggest operator, Wonga, was recently ordered to pay more than £2.6million to 45,000 customers who were sent bullying letters from fictitious law firms after falling behind on repayments.

The company invented the legal and debt recovery firms to turn the screw on customers by giving the impression their cases had been passed to third party organisations.

The FCA said the reason that Dollar Financial is not facing any sanction is because the company broke its own internal rules designed to ensure loans are affordable, rather than any City regulations.

A computer software problem meant that staff at The Money Shop agreed higher level loans than the firm’s own guidelines said were acceptable based on the individual’s income.

Warning: The Financial Conduct Authority warned rogue loan firms have failed to treat customers fairly

Director of supervision at the FCA, Clive Adamson, said: ‘The FCA expects all credit providers to carry out proper checks to ensure that borrowers don’t take on more than they can afford to pay back.

‘We are pleased that Dollar is working with us to put matters right for its customers and to ensure that these practices are a thing of the past.’

Dollar will contact all the affected customers and expects to provide refunds in cash totalling £79,000, with the remaining customers seeing their outstanding balance reduced.

The refunds of interest will only relate to that part of the loan that was above what should have been allowed under the firm’s own lending criteria.

Separately, Dollar has committed to improving its approach to assessing affordability and agreed to appoint an independent ‘Skilled Person’ to review its lending decisions.

The review will consider whether customers are being treated fairly and are now only being lent sums that they can afford to repay.

The problems at Dollar relate to its brand The Money Shop. The firm also operates in the UK under the trading names Payday UK, Payday Express and Ladder Loans.

Payday loans offered by The Money Shop have a typical APR interest rate of approaching 3,000per cent.

The firm also has more than 500 high street outlets offering pawnbroking, cheque cashing, foreign currency, gold-buying services, pre-loaded holiday and cash debit cards and money transfers.

Dollar Financial, based in Nottingham, is part of DFC Global Corp, which was founded in Pennsylvania in the USA in 1979 and now operates across the USA, Canada, Ireland and Continental Europe.

Struggling: The ombudsman is concerned that many struggle to repay loans but feel powerless to complain

Money Shop managing director, Sanjiv Corepal, said: ‘The Money Shop is a business which prides itself on the trust enjoyed between customer and company.  Mistakes do happen and, when they do, we can be trusted to put them right, as we have in this instance.’

The FCA is about to announce new controls on the industry that will effectively cap the interest and charges the firms can apply.

The decision, which could come later this week, is expected to fix the cap at around £30 for every £100 borrowed.

Payday lenders are desperate to rehabilitate their image. Wonga yesterday announced the appointment of a new chairman, who promised to review and clean up its loans business.

Andy Haste, the former chief executive of insurer RSA, said there will be a review of the customer base and products to ensure that the group is lending only to ‘customers who can reasonably afford to repay their loans’.

The firm said it will also change its marketing to reduce the risk of inadvertently attracting the very young or vulnerable.
