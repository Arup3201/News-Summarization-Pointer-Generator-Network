New Jersey governor Chris Christie has lost at least 100 pounds since undergoing gastric band surgery last year, according to a leading doctor in weight loss surgery.

Despite having visibly slimmed down since undergoing the surgery in February 2013, Christie has to date refused to put a figure on his weight loss.

But a doctor who was shown before and after pictures of the potential Republican presidential candidate - once an estimated 200 pounds overweight - believes he has shed at least half of those excess pounds.

'He's lost 100 pounds, if not a little bit more, which puts him on a very good track,' Dr Jaime Ponce, former president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, told The Record of north Jersey.

'The pictures are very impressive,' he added, responding to the photos provided by the newspaper.

Christie, 52, has struggled with his weight for years and said he decided to have the Lap-band surgery for his 'long-term health'.

But his remarkable weight loss has led to speculation the governor is getting in shape  to make a bid for the White House. 

Christie has not yet announced any plans for the 2016 election, but he  is contemplating a presidential run for 2016 - and a slimmed-down physique may be part of the groundwork.

According to the New York Times, in September Christie told donors who attended an event hosted by billionaire David Koch in New York that he understood that he needed to shed a few pounds if he wanted to move beyond Trenton.

But in May last year, Christie revealed that he had chosen to undergo weight loss surgery due to family considerations.

Adjustable gastric banding - often referred to as Lap-Band surgery - is considered the least invasive of the weight loss surgeries.

It involves an inflatable device placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch.

The surgery is intended to slow consumption of food and so reduce the quantity of food consumed.

The procedure is often done on an outpatient basis and the surgery typically takes less than an hour.

Weight loss is usually gradual and steady. The band can be adjusted by a doctor after the initial surgery.

Risks include obstructions, band slippage, difficulty swallowing, infection and nutritional deficiency.

According to The Record, speaking at a promotional event in Princeton, Christie opened up about his struggle with his weight.

He said: 'The things that really got me down, the moments where I would say to myself, 'Why can't I beat this? Why can't I do better?', it would be when I'd be going out with [wife] Mary Pat on a Friday night or Saturday night.

'I'd be changing out of my professional clothes ... and would go to casual clothes that I didn't wear a lot, and then something wouldn't fit,' he said. 'That's when I'd really be angry with myself.'

He said the public reaction to his disclosure that he had had lap band surgery was 'absolutely insane and over the top'.

Christie said he often hears from people who 'don't understand' what it's like to struggle with being overweight.

'It's not as simple as, 'Push yourself away from the table and you'll be fine,' he added.

Christie's doctor released a report in October 2013 while the governor was running for re-election stating that Christie 'has adopted a healthy lifestyle,' including a good diet and regular exercise.

Dr Rachana Kulkarni wrote that Mr Christie 'has taken a very proactive role in his health.

'He is aware of being overweight and has taken several measure to address this issue.'

According to USA Today, the doctor explained that Mr Christie's one-hour workouts included aerobic exercises and resistance training.
