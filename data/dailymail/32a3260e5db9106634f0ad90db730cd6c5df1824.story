Christine Walker went to Cheltenham General Hospital with a 
bruised elbow but died after contracting norovirus

An elderly woman who was admitted to hospital with a bruised elbow died after doctors failed to check on her for three days, an inquest has heard.

Christine Walker, 86, from Silverton, Devon, was treated for minor bruising at Cheltenham General Hospital in March last year after a fall while staying at her son's house in Gloucestershire.

Despite having just minor bruising from the fall, Mrs Walker was kept in the hospital under observation.

But when she was moved to a different ward the next day, the pensioner was not seen by a doctor for another three days.

By that time, Mrs Walker had contracted norovirus - from which she died two weeks later.

Speaking after the inquest into her death, the family said Mrs Walker had been well before the hospital admission and had been 'up and down the stairs' just days earlier.

In a statement the family said: 'Mr Walker and his family are still 
coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital 
with a bruised elbow and went on to die.'

At an inquest into her death at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court, the hearing heard how the mother-of-two had been kept in hospital under observation because of her age and frail health.

Doctors, who saw Mrs Walker on March 17, were concerned that she might have suffered an unforeseen injury during the fall.

The next day, the patient was moved into a private room on the Kemerton Ward - which her family claim was dirty and understaffed - but was not looked at by doctors.

By the time she was checked on March 21, Mrs Walker was vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea.

She died on April 10 from norovirus, pneumonia and haematuria, which is when there is blood in the urine.

During the hearing, a consultant physician at Cheltenham General Hospital admitted that no senior doctor had been assigned to look after Mrs Walker.

She said: 'That did not happen and I do not know why that did not happen.'

Mrs Walker's son Nicholas, with whom she had been staying at the time, said he was told by a
 nurse that she was the only person on shift during one particular 
morning - an allegation the hospital denies.

The inquest heard there were 'staffing pressures' on the ward which 
'could have been an explanation' for why Mrs Walker was not checked for 
three days by medical staff - in which time she contracted the virus

The hearing heard the Kemerton Ward is meant to have at least two nurses and two health care assistants on duty at all times.

Nurse Jonathan Burford said: 'There was a mixture of ward staff, agency staff and bank staff [cover] on the ward. It was a challenge to meet minimum staffing levels at times.'

When coroner Katy Skerrett asked whether that could be 'an explanation for why Mrs Walker was not looked in on for those three days', the nurse replied 'yes'.

Lawyer Jamie Gamble, who was representing Mr Walker, told the inquest it was 'highly likely' that Mrs Walker caught the virus on the ward.

'Mr Walker and his family are still 
coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital 
with a bruised elbow and went on to die'

Walker family statement

He said: 'The family made a complaint about the room Mrs Walker was in being dirty.

'The complaint was that there was an incontinence sheet in the room from the patient before.'

Sister Sue Harris, the nurse in charge of the hospital at night, apologised to the Walker family and admitted the room was untidy - but not dirty.

She said: 'The family were not happy about the nursing care on the ward. I apologised.

'I was unhappy that they had experienced that on the ward as we have a high standard of nursing care. I was upset. The private room was untidy. I would not say dirty.'

Recording a narrative verdict, Gloucestershire coroner Katy Skerrett said: 'This woman was admitted to hospital having suffered a fall. She was frail due to her age and various other health issues.

'She was not seen by the medic team for three days, during which she had norovirus. The delay seems to be after she contracted the virus.

'There were staffing pressures at the hospital and there was a medley of Trust, agency and bank staff working in what was a temporary winter ward.

'After a discussion with the family she was placed on the LCP. She died on April 10. I offer my sincere condolences to her family.'

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Walker, who has moved from Cheltenham to Devon since her death, said: 'She was not a frail woman. She was up and down the stairs, eating three meals a day.'

His partner Sue Taylor added: 'She had a wicked sense of humour. She certainly was not frail.'

A statement read on behalf of the Walker family's solicitor Oliver Thorne read: 'Today’s inquest has highlighted a number of failings on the part of Gloucestershire NHS Foundation Trust.

'These include ward cleanliness, communication and staffing pressures. The main one is how Mrs Walker went for three days without being seen.

'Mr Walker and his family are still coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital with a bruised elbow and went on to die.'

The Walker family said it is now considering taking legal action against the trust.
