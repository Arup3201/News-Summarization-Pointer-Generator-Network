Trainer Willie Mullins still rates Hurricane Fly as his No 1 Champion Hurdle hope after the remarkable 10-year-old landed the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown for fourth time on Monday.

The victory was a 21st at Grade One level as Ruby Walsh’s mount extended his unbeaten record at the Dublin track to nine with a battling half-length victory from Jezki and AP McCoy.

Mullins also trains unbeaten Christmas Hurdle winner Faugheen, who is evens favourite for the Champion with Coral compared to Hurricane Fly’s odds of 12-1.

Trainer Willie Mullins says that Hurricane Fly is his top Champion Hurdle horse ahead of Faugheen

But Mullins said: ‘To me, he's our top Champion Hurdle horse. He (Faugheen) looks the one coming up, but he's (Hurricane Fly) doing it. 

'I think he's the best anyone has ever trained over jumps. I'll never have another horse like him. Hopefully, we find another one but he's unique.’

Hurricane Fly, who had looked like he was heading to retirement when fourth to Jezki in last season’s Champion Hurdle, will now attempt to win the Irish Champion Hurdle for a fifth time back at Leopardstown on January 25.

Mullins completed a Grade One double on the final day of the Leopardstown Christmas meeting when Bryan Cooper-ridden Don Poli won the Topaz Novices’ Chase by three lengths from Apache Stronghold.
