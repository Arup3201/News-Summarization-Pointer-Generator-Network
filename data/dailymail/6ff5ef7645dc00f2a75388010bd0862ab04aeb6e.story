Authorities in the Cayman Islands have ended a search for a U.S. Marvel/DC comic book artist who went missing while snorkeling with his wife on a vacation.

Norman Lee, who worked on Avengers and X-Men, were about 250 yards off the coast of Grand Cayman on Thursday afternoon when he became separated from wife of fives years, Jan.

Despite round-the-clock helicopter, diving and boat searches, investigators have found no sign of the 47-year-old from Weymouth, Massachusetts.

Went missing: He was snorkeling with his wife Jan on Thursday when they became separated

On Saturday evening, the search was called off after chief inspector Brad Ebanks said the currents are so strong it is 'unlikely that we will make any recovery at this stage.'

Lee started working for Marvel and DC Comics in 1995 as an 'inker', drawing over pencil sketches in pen before the comic goes to print. 

He is scheduled to appear at Boston Comic Con this summer.

Tributes have flooded in on Lee's Facebook page.

One of his favorite artists and a source of inspiration, Mark McKenna, wrote: 'I was thinking last night about my friends, Norman and Jan Lee, whom my heart aches for at this moment... No BS in Norman, he told it like it was.'

Fellow X-Men artist Jorge Molina wrote: 'A great talent and positive guy with a smile on his face 24/7, my thoughts go to him and his family.'
