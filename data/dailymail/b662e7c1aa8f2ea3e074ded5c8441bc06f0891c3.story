The pope is a keen Twitter user himself, regularly posting tweets on his own feeds in nine languages, which boast more than 10 million followers in total.

He is proving to be a very modern leader of the Catholic Church and yesterday it emerged Pope Francis is set to grace the cover of Rolling Stone as he continues to capture the hearts and minds of worshippers across the world.

The Pope features on the front page of the rock and roll magazine's new issue - with an accompanying article titled 'The times they are a-changin''.

Dressed in white robes, he can be seen smiling at the camera while waving his right hand.

The cover photo itself was taken by the magazine's contributing editor Mark Binelli, who visited the Vatican in person, according to Rolling Stone.

During his visit, Mr Binelli witnessed the Pope display his 'all-inclusive' attitude by telling a congregation weathering a storm in the piazza that he wished he could be with them.

'He seemed to really mean it,' Mr Binelli told the magazine.
