An outrageous stunt considered a bit of a joke has landed a man, who taxied his light plane down a main street  and parked it outside a pub, a hefty $5000 fine.

Anthony Whiteway, 37, infuriated police from the small town of Newman, in Western Australia's Pilbara region when they were called to the Newman hotel Purple Pub earlier this month to where the small yellow plane had been parked outside.

He was charged with committing an act likely to endanger the life, health or safety of a person, at Newman Magistrates Court on Tuesday.

A small two-seater plane, with no wings, was found parked outside a local pub in West Australia's Newman by police officers on Friday 

Anthony Whiteaway was charged $5,000

The plane which had its propeller running, had its wings removed and was being steered by foot pedals.

'It was a pretty stupid thing to do,' Newman Police sergeant Mark McKenzie told AAP after the incident earlier this month.

'Kids were coming home from school. It could have been very ugly.' 

'All he needed was one gust of wind ... because without the wings, it's not stable.'

'People think it was a bit of a laugh but it was very dangerous and we're not very happy with it.'

Mr Whiteway, who does not hold a pilot's licence, told the ABC he wouldn't take the plane to the pub again.

A bar tender at the Newman Hotel (pictured) said  customers cheered the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend'

The man who refers to himself as 'Automan' told West Australian newspaper that he 'taxied it perfectly'

'I knew what I was doing,' he told West Australian newspaper.

'I taxied it perfectly. Look how well I parked it.'

At the time of the incident, a bar tender at the Newman Hotel told Daily Mail Australia that the 37-year-old driver of the plane entertained pub patrons by 'playing dumb' when being questioned by police.

She said the customers were cheering the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend'. 

And despite labelling it very dangerous, local officers did not entirely fail to see the humours side of the stunt. 

Not all of the local officers have failed to see the humours side of the incident, with Esperance police launching a  Twitter competition

Following the incident, Esperance police launched a competition over Twitter asking social media users to come up with the best caption for a photograph of the plane parked outside the Newman Hotel.

It wrote, 'Best caption wins a Mars Bar and tour of Esperance police station. Thanks #Newman police for the chuckles.'

And Facebook users certainly delivered with an array of hilarious and pun filled captions including 'when all else fails you have to wing it', 'Parking, Northern Territory style', and 'a man and a plane go into a bar'.
