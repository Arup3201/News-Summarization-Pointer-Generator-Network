Anthony Pettis is expecting a tough night as he defends his lightweight title against Rafael dos Anjos.

Pettis makes only his second defence of the belt he won against Benson Henderson 18 months ago as he headlines UFC 185 in Dallas.

And although he is predicting a knockout, the American knows he won't have it all his own way.

The American looked in fantastic shape as he took to the scales in front of the world's media

'The pressure is on. When all these people support you, you want to be able to perform.

'He's probably the most dangerous guy in the division in my opinion. I think he’ s a great competitor. He’s got a solid, well-rounded game, he’s a great kickboxer, amazing jujitsu, I just feel like his biggest strength is his heart. He doesn’t quit, he just keeps coming..

'His biggest weakness is that he’s never fought a guy like me. I feel like my angles and the things I throw in the Octagon are second to none. My prediction - knockout. I need a knockout, it’s been a long time since my last knockout and I’m not going past the first round.

'He's a good fighter, but I'm a great fighter.'

Dos Anjos has won his last three bouts, including a stunning first-round knockout of Henderson last August.

And he has no fear about being the underdog once again.

'I am going to go in there and take my belt,' he said. 'I do not know how the fight is going to go, but I know it will not go to the judges. I will not allow the judges to decide and it will not go five rounds.

'I will pressure him like I pressure all my fights. I will be ready for his style and he will not be ready for my power. I am going in there to take my belt. That is all I want from him.

'I am very excited to be the first lightweight champion from Brazil. The belt has a date to be mine and that will be Saturday. It's in God's hands.

'It does not bother me to be an underdog. I am an underdog in most of my fights. Maybe it is a good thing for me, he has all the pressure.'

In Saturday's co-main event, Joanna Jedrzejczyk bids to become the first European female UFC champion when she takes on Carla Esparza for the strawweight title.

'They [the fans] see me as the champion because I'm going to be on Saturday anyway,' she said.

'I think Carla is just focused on her wrestling and I've already shown I can beat that. So, good luck to her.

'The UFC saw that I'm ready and I can handle it [the title shot]. I was born for this. I'm comfortable and I'm treating it as any other fight.'

But Esparza plans to upset the Pole's party with an early finish.

'I'm hoping the fight is going to go how everyone thinks it'll go; grappler takes striker down and grappler wins. My goal is to do it in under 14 seconds,' she said.

'I feel like I'm most likely going to have the strength advantage; I feel like with longer, lankier athletes they're not as strong as athletes with my build.

'I only care about winning fights; I don’t care about the hype or promotion behind it. If I'm not the champ the hype and talk doesn't matter.

'I think female MMA is the biggest female sport out there. We're being put on the same stage as the men and sometimes headlining in Ronda [Rousey’s] case. We're on top right now.'
