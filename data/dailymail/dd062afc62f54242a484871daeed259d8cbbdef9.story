For a home which costs a shed-load, it won't give you much space.

A humble brick and pebbledash garage measuring just 19ft by 10ft has gone on sale in a tiny village in rural Wales - for an eye-watering £38,500.

The cost, more than for a one-bed flat 20 miles away, is thought to be one of the highest ever seen in the area.

Expensive parking spot: This garage in the Lledr Valley in north Wales costs £38,500 - more than a nearby flat

Humble: The 19ft by 10ft garage has no water, no electricity, no heating and no windows - but a good location

An estate agent said the simple structure in the picturesque Lledr Valley would be ideal for anglers, walkers and campers.

Its downsides include that it has no heating, carpets, electricity, running water or even windows.

And it comes on a plot measuring 60ft by 30ft, which appears to be uncultivated hardstanding used for little more than parking a car.

The description on the estate agent's 
website adds: 'No mains services provided but we understand mains 
electricity is nearby. Mains water is positioned on a council byway.'

Yet the property in Pont-y-Pant, north Wales, is minutes away from spectacular views of the Snowdonia National Park and several popular fishing spots.

How it measures up: The specifications of the garage compared to those of a flat 20 miles away in Colwyn Bay

Rural: The garage is near the station for the small valley village of Pont-y-pant (pictured)

Set in picturesque woodland, it is also close to a railway station and two miles from the small valley village of Dolwyddelan.

At a push, the garage would even fit a small motor home.

The prime outhouse costs more than an entire one-bedroom flat in the seaside town of Colwyn Bay, just 20 miles away.

There, buyers can get hold of a second-floor flat with central heating, electricity, running water and double-glazing for £37,500.

Listed last month at a similar price to several other flats nearby, it also has a separate kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedroom and even a mezzanine office.

Comparison: The recent listing for a one-bed flat for just £37,500, £1,000 less than the garage 20 miles away

Peaceful: The garage is located in picturesque woodland and has just about enough space for a caravan

Secluded: The hut is off this country lane in the Snowdonia National Park, popular with ramblers and anglers

But there is one major disadvantage - it has no off-street parking.

Average property prices in the Lledr Valley, meanwhile, are also low compared to the high price for a simple brick hut.

At £118,602, well below the British average, an ordinary terraced house in nearby Dolwyddelan village is worth only around three times the cost of the shed. An average terraced house in Colwyn Bay costs £108,000.

Estate agent Iwan Williams, who is selling the garage, said: 'The price might seem expensive but the Lledr Valley is a very popular fishing area.

'We have had a lot of anglers showing interest in the garage for shelter and parking.'
