The Italian Grand Prix was a good weekend for Mercedes. After what had happened in Spa, it was a strong comeback race for the team to finish first and second.

During the race Lewis was just that little bit quicker, so I was always digging and trying to find that extra bit of pace.

On lap 29, on the approach to Turn One, I made a mistake and simply messed up. Then, instead of taking the risk that I might damage my tyres, I decided to go straight on at the chicane.

It is a very difficult part of the track and, as you would have seen, Lewis made exactly the same mistake a couple of laps later. He however, managed to make the corner, but his tyres were a bit flat-spotted. That was my worry, and that is why I decided to go straight on, because it was so early in my stint.

In hindsight it might have been a better decision to cut the chicane out and go over the grass because that was the quicker route, but it was an instinctive reaction.

And let me just add one sentence about the conspiracy theories: that it is complete rubbish.

On the podium there was a minority of fans who booed me again. It isn't a nice feeling and some of the other drivers have said to me that it is wrong and unnecessary, but I respect the actions of the fans and I understand it in some way.

It is their only way of showing me that they did not appreciate what had happened back in Spa and that is OK.

Because of my misjudgement a lot of people were not able to see an entertaining battle, and Lewis was also denied a position where he could have challenged for the victory.

Under the lights

The Singapore Grand Prix is without question one of the toughest tracks physically because it is very, very hot here.

My doctor advises me to drink six or seven litres of water each day, but I can't do that; it's literally like drinking all day long! So, I just have to take on as much liquid as I can because you sweat so much in the car.

But it is a great track, one that really pushes the car to the limits, too, and because it is under the lights it makes for a great atmosphere and a brilliant spectacle.

The race is at 8pm local time, so we are all staying on a European time zone which means being awake until 3 or 4 in the morning. It might sound crazy, but I find it is really easy to do because essentially my sleep pattern remains unchanged.

For instance, back at home in Monaco at 7pm, which is 2am over here, you wouldn't ask 'so, how do you still stay awake?'

It does mean that my wife and I have to order room service however, because all of the restaurants in the city are closed. I do a lot of reading or watch a film. I even went down to the bar with my wife Vivian the other year. My best man lives and works in Singapore so I have been able to spend some time with him and his partner which is great, too.

Ahead of this weekend's race I know I face another big challenge against Lewis but this is an awesome battle to be a part of, and it is the reason why I am in Formula One.

Competing with someone like Lewis, who I have known for such a long time, is fantastic. I need to bring my absolute best to beat him and that is very exciting for me, so hopefully we will have many more years like this one.

Radio silence

The new team radio rules, which limits the communication between the pit wall and the driver, is a challenge because it is different.

Up until now so much of what we were doing in the car during a race was a result of what we were being instructed to do by the team; whether it is to drive fast, drive slow, take care of the tyres, or manage the fuel.

Now however, we are on our own, we make our own choices and we do our own thing and that is better and it is the right way for the sport to go because it makes the racing pure.

Fans will enjoy the new team rules more, as they provide purer racing, according to Mercedes' Nico Rosberg

For example, earlier this season when I was trying to overtake Lewis. But whenever I went to increase my electronic boost power, which I can only do for a couple of corners, Lewis's engineer did a great job, spotted it and told him to do the same.

Every time I adjusted my settings, Lewis would replicate that, so there was not a difference in performance in our respective cars which never gave me the opportunity to surprise him.

But with the new rules that should be over now. The other car will never see what his team-mate is doing; whether he is trying to attack or defend. We are on our own and that makes the racing much more exciting. The fans are happy about it because it makes the racing simpler.

I have done my best to prepare for this new era. Earlier this week I was in the simulator I was working hard to get ready for this change and although I made some mistakes, I am ready for it now.
