An American couple and their four newly adopted children arrived safely back in the country on Saturday night after enduring a month-long ordeal in Ukraine, where they were stranded for the past three weeks as the country tittered on the brink of collapse.

When Don and Lisa Jenkins from Topeka, Kansas, flew to Kiev to adopt Tatiana, 17; Angela, 16; Natalie, 15; and Roman, 8, on February 2 they expected the process to take just a couple of days.

Unfortunately for the couple, they arrived just as the civil unrest and protests were turning to chaotic violence that threatened to derail their adoption process.

Worth the wait: Don and Lisa Jenkins from Topeka, Kansas, flew to Kiev to adopt Tatiana, 17; Angela, 16; Natalie, 15; and Roman, 8, on February 2 and only arrived home on March 8

Trapped in a flat they had rented in central Kiev, the Jenkins found themselves less than a mile for the fighting taking place on the streets of the Ukrainian capital.

Fortunately the violence died down after about a week, but then the family had to endure a seemingly endless series of delays to get the necessary paperwork from the Ukrainian government so the kids could leave the country.

On Friday morning the Jenkins family finally obtained the last of the children's passports and visas and then quickly packed in preparation of leaving early on Saturday morning.

It took the family 22 hours from leaving Kiev until they walked out of the arrivals lounge at Kansas City International Airport at 9pm on Saturday night to be warmly greeted by a dozen family members.

Earlier the three teenage girls and young boy had officially became American citizens when their jet had touched down at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

The Jenkinses, who have two grown sons, Tyler, 26, and Taylor, 24, had been foster parents before adopting the four Ukrainian children.

Lisa Jenkins, 46, told CJOnline that the couple had at first considered adopting American children, 'but the Lord led us in this direction.'

Many girls in Ukraine who don't get adopted end up in prostitution, human trafficking or in the drug trade.

In spite of the traumatic 
experienced in Kiev, she said she would do it all over again if it 
meant being able to adopt the four children.

'Itâ€™s been well worth it and I would do it all over again, as Iâ€™m sure my husband would tell you the same thing,' Lisa Jenkins told Fox 4.

One of the first things the family will be doing now that they are safely home is enjoy a postponed Christmas celebration together, the Jenkinses have kept their decorations up this year after promising their children that theyâ€™d celebrate their first Christmas together when they finally arrived in the U.S.
