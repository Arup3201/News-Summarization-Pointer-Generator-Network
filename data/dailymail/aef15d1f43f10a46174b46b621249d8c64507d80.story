A body was recovered Wednesday at the site of a massive explosion that destroyed a popular Kansas City, and the city's mayor said there was no certainty the rubble wasn't concealing more victims.

Mayor Sly James declined to say whether the body belonged to a man or a woman, though authorities have been looking for a woman who worked at JJ's restaurant.

The female worker was seen there before the Tuesday evening blast and reported missing afterward. They previously said she was the only person still unaccounted for following the explosion and fire.

But James said at a news conference that authorities can't be ‘100 per cent sure that we can account for every single person that may have been at JJ's when the explosion occurred.’

‘Since this started without a list of 
those in the building…those search and rescue people are out there going
through the rubble and will continue to go through the rubble,’ James 
said. ‘They will continue to investigate until weather shuts it down.’

Emergency crews are using cadaver 
dogs to search the smoldering remains of a Kansas City restaurant that 
burned to the ground on Tuesday night following a gas explosion and 
massive blaze.

At least 14 people 
were injured, with at least two reported in critical condition, in the blast and resulting fire 
that completely destroyed JJ's restaurant.

The cause of the blast remains under investigation. Earlier City Manager Troy Schulte said it appeared an accident by a utility contractor had caused the blast, and a statement from utility Missouri Gas Energy late Tuesday reiterated that possibility, but Berardi and others cautioned jumping to conclusions.

'This investigation is ongoing,' Berardi said. 'We do have reports that there was an odor of gas earlier. But, again, this investigation needs to be concluded before we want to speculate on any of that.'

The explosion sparked a massive, block-engulfing blaze in an upscale Kansas City shopping district.

Earlier Kansas City police had said the blast was caused by a car crashing into a gas main just after 6 p.m. Fire officials said later they were not aware of a crash being involved in the blast.

Other witnesses noted street signs in
the area indicated utility work was being done in the area, and a 
worker at a restaurant destroyed in the fire said the facility was being
renovated at the time.

Police Sgt. Tony Sanders said the manager of JJ's restaurant was unable to account for three people, but it was unclear whether they were caught in the blaze or had left earlier.

'The first thing we need to be concerned about is the people that are injured,' said Mayor Sly James, who also praised the work of first responders. James said officials were in contact with Missouri Gas Energy.

The University of Kansas Hospital was treating six people injured in the blast, said spokesman Bob Hallinan. He said one person was in critical condition, two were in serious condition and two others were expected to be released.

All of those injuries were traumatic, such as broken bones, rather than burns or smoke inhalation. The final patient there was a burn victim who was transferred from Truman Medical Center, Hallinan said.

Dr. Marc Larsen, medical director of the emergency room at St. Luke's Hospital, which is near the scene of the fire, said they had treated eight people, six of whom were walk-ins with minor injuries.

He said two males were in critical 
condition and would be kept overnight. He said one had extensive burns 
and another had facial trauma.

The smell of gas remained very strong near the area long after the suspected explosion.

There were signs that utility work was being done in area. A phone message left Tuesday seeking comment from Missouri Gas Energy was not immediately returned.

Jim Ligon, a bartender who has worked at JJ's restaurant for five years, wasn't working Tuesday night but said he started getting texts and calls from co-workers minutes after the explosion.

He said the incident happened during the peak of weekday happy hour, when there is typically anywhere from 15 to 45 people in the bar area as well as three to five tables of diners at the restaurant.

Response: Firemen and utility workers respond to a gas explosion and massive fire Tuesday night in the Plaza shopping district in Kansas City, Mo.

'JJ's has a small staff, a family feel,' said Ligon, 45, of Kansas City, Mo. 'You see the same 100 people all the time - a bar and restaurant for regulars. We're just really hoping we come out of here OK in terms of injuries.'

Ligon said he was on his way Tuesday night to meet up with co-workers at another bar in town to talk about the incident.

Video showed dozens of firefighters and other emergency responders battling a massive blaze that appeared to have engulfed an entire block, with flames burning through the roofs. Black smoke swirled in the air and debris littered surrounding streets.

The shopping area was established in 1922 by J.C. Nichols. Based on the architecture of Seville, Spain, it includes retail, restaurants, apartments and offices.
