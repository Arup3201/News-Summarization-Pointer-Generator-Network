A former Las Vegas prostitute of 16 years, who now runs a Christian nonprofit to help those negatively affected by the industry that nearly killed her, has written about her drastic life-turnaround.

Annie Lobart, 46, is the founder of Hookers for Jesus; a name she admits 'many disagree with' - which offers support for women in the sex industry, as well as a Las Vegas-based safe house for those who wish to escape their situations.

Ms Lobart, who lost her virginity at 18, grew up as a self-confessed 'goodie two shoes,' but her life took a sharp turn when her boyfriend at the time revealed himself as a pimp, and subsequently led her into the dingy world of prostitution.

'I took pop culture's pill and swallowed it whole,' writes the buxom blonde of the 'money, presents and parties' that came with the job.

Ms Lobart was initially enthralled by what she describes as 'the honeymoon phase' of her 'glamorous' life in the sex industry; during which time she was a stripper, a 'high-class escort' and a street prostitute, and says she encountered plenty of 'very famous' men who paid for her services.

Although she confesses she went through a phase of 'sex addiction,' she claims the practice was never actually enjoyable to her.

'Sex for money is not pleasurable, it is not fun, us girls do not enjoy it,' she writes. 'In fact there were many times I just wanted to hurt the man that was touching me.'

Slippery slope: At first, Ms Lobart (left and right) was seduced by the 'money, presents and parties' that came with her life as a call girl, but says that being paid for sex was never 'fun'

Before long, she was heading down a dark path; suffering the traumas of abuse, 'drugs of every kind,' pornography, anorexia and repeated abortions.

'Sex for money is not pleasurable, it is not fun, us girls do not enjoy it'

'I was beaten, raped, kidnapped, strangled, suffocated, guns put in my mouth, hair cut off, tied up, gagged, put in trunks of cars, bones broken, spit on, kicked, pushed, stalked by crazy men,' she writes.

Though she thought things couldn't get any worse, Ms Lobart was then diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma - a form of cancer which affects the lymph tissue - and even though she recovered, and finally abandoned her career as a prostitute with the help of a former client, things continued to spin downhill. 

Trauma: Ms Lobart (bottom) soon fell prey to an almost unbelievable chain of bad fortune, including beatings, rapes, abortions, kidnappings and then cancer, but after finding God, she turned her life around and now campaigns to help others

Having flirted with the concept of God over the years, but having not yet fully embraced Christianity, Ms Lobart thought her wealthy businessman boyfriend and his 'high-society square lifestyle' would be the answer, literally, to her prayers.

Instead she formed an addiction to cocaine, a substance she describes as 'the drug even the devil himself does not want.'

Following an accidental overdose in 2003 that almost claimed her life, Ms Lobart began to take her faith more seriously. She claims the moment her life changed forever came when Jesus visited her in a dream.

'When I chose to fully believe that He died in place of me for my sins, it literally blew me away,' she writes. 'Jesus came into my heart...and He literally took my life back from the devil.'

'When I chose to fully believe that He died in place of me for my sins, it literally blew me away'

Ms Lobart founded Hookers for Jesus in 2005 and states its primary mission is: 'To Hook (Outreach) Give Hope (Jesus) 
Heal (emotional & spiritual restoration) and Help (Transitional 
Assistance) for those who have been negatively affected by sex 
trafficking and the adult entertainment industry.'

Ms Lobart married her husband Oz Fox, the lead musician in a heavy metal band called Stryper, in 2009, and is currently writing a book about her extremely eventful life so far, and her plans for the future.
