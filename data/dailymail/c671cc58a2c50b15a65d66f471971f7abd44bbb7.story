The family of a forensic expert who was killed on a train track claim he was driven to suicide after having his fingers amputated.

Father-of-two Michael Hatcher, 33, had two fingers removed on his left hand as a child, following an accident on a slide.

But an inquest in Worcestershire heard that in 2009 complications meant he had to have the stumps of his ring and little finger cut off completely.

He was then prescribed powerful painkillers to relieve the agony he felt in his nerve endings

His family yesterday told Stourport Coroners' Court they believe the side-effects of the drugs made him suicidal.

Mr Hatcher, who worked as a senior forensic production technician specialising in crime scenes, left his home on July 1 this year after first telling his wife 'I love you.'

The inquest heard he left his home in the early morning before walking to nearby Perry Wood Bridge in Defford .

Stourport Coroners Court heard he was then hit by a train travelling from Derby to Plymouth.

Recording a verdict of suicide, Worcestershire Coroner Geraint William said Mr Hatcher was found at Perry Wood Bridge Defford having been spotted by a train driver.

Michael Hatcher, 33, had two fingers removed on his left hand following an accident when he went down a slide as a child. In 2009 complications in his hand meant he had to have the stumps of his ring and little finger cut off completely

Speaking after the hearing, his distraught widow Kirsty, 28, a nursery nurse, paid tribute to her husband.

She said: 'He was a wonderful man, hard-working, kind and a brilliant husband and father. We both met in January 2008 and married in September 2009. 

'We have two children together, Callum who is three and Oscar who is five months old.

'Michael struggled with the constant pain in his hand and was prescribed pain killers and a beta blocker to try and ease the pain.

'He struggled with the side effects of these tablets for two-and-a-half years. 

'He just couldn’t win. If he didn’t take the tablets he was in a lot of pain, but if he did the side effects of the pills made him very low.

'The weekend before he died he was his happy normal self, very loving and affectionate.

'We said so many nice things to each other and were even making plans for the future. The morning he died he came up to the bedroom before he left for work and told me that he loved me. 

'I told him that I loved him too, that was the last thing we said to each other. 

'I am heartbroken and so is his eldest son. He was a very loving man who would do anything for anybody and I am struggling to come to terms with his loss. He was the love of my life.

'I have told Callum that daddy has gone to the sky and he keeps telling me to get a really big ladder and bring him back down. I wish it was that simple.'

Mr Hatcher's sister Janine Philpotts, 36, said losing his fingers drove her brother over the edge.

She said: 'My brother was a happy person. Until he started taking those pills, they just zapped the life out of him.

'Towards the end he just wasn’t my brother anymore.

'We were born in South Africa and we had a swimming pool and he broke his fingers on the slide.

'As he went down his hand slipped and he caught his fingers and then the doctors had to put pins in them to reset them.

'A few years down the line he started suffering from real bad pains in his fingers so they tried to put pins in it again and they came out the side of his fingers.

'He also had bone growing on his fingers too, so he had to have his two fingers amputated but he was still really suffering with the pain, this was in 2006.

'In 2009 he had them amputated again.

Mr Hatcher - pictured with son Oscar - told his wife he loved her the day he died

'As a brother he was brilliant, he would do anything for you and he had a heart of gold.

'He was a really happy person which is why we can’t understand why he did what he did.

'When I found out I went into shock, the whole family did. We’ve put down the reason he did it to the tablets.

'He was a forensic technician, he loved his job, he loved going to work, it was one thing he really enjoyed.

'I want people to know he was a great person and not to think badly of him because of what he did.'
