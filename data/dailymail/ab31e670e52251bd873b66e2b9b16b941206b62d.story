She discarded her manager and her boyfriend in the same year.

And Kylie Minogue has finally revealed what prompted her to make the decision to spring clean her life last year: A mid-life crisis.

The star alludes to feeling despondent by how her life appeared on the ‘horizon’ and was asked if she made the changes in her life in order to give herself a fresh start.

She replied: ‘Yeah I did. I had a true epiphany. I have only had this one and I remember it as if it were slow motion.

'I guess there were thoughts and moments building up to this but I had a vision and the vision was a horizon with nothing on it.

'Our lives never have nothing on the horizon, there is always something you are looking forward to or dreading but there was nothing there. I felt very calm and I knew in that moment that I need a new landscape.’

The 45-year-old split from 35-year-old Spanish model Andrés Velencoso last October after five years, changed her management team and also signed up to be a judge on The Voice, her first foray into the world of live TV talent shows.

Miss Minogue has helped boost ratings and turned the show into must-see BBC viewing on a Saturday night.

But New Year’s Eve gave Miss Minogue nothing to celebrate.

Speaking on the Norway chat show Skavlan she said: ‘I spent New Year’s Eve alone, it was one of my best New Year’s actually. No it’s not normal. I have never done it before. If it is the right time for you then I highly recommend it. It was very quiet. I did not do anything special, I did not even have a drink actually.

'Am I sounding very sad right now. I stayed up until midnight and I was happy to be quiet. I actually don’t like too much silence as I think too much but it was meant to be for me. I really enjoyed it. I really reflected on the year as i had known how difficult it had been for many reasons.

'So I wanted to reflect upon that and let those thoughts settle and put some out for the next year. This makes me sound very sensible. I am not normally like this. It was kind of amazing for me to be this organised in my mind.’

Miss Minogue, a child actress, rose to fame in the Australian soap Neighbours. She used her role in the show to launch her career as a singer.

Reflecting on her early days in the world of Showbusiness, Miss Minogue told Skavlan: ‘I wished I had said “No” more.

It took me a long time to learn to say no. I started as a child actor and as a teenager I never wanted to let anyone down and I think it takes some time to find yourself and the ability to say no.’

And although she is known for her easy charm and mega-watt smile, Miss Minogue revealed she is not immune to being angry – but she simply goes quiet: ‘I don’t have an intimidating voice. I might have a look. I know I have the look. No-one wants the look. When I need to be mad it is silence. The clouds are coming over it is doom and gloom.’
