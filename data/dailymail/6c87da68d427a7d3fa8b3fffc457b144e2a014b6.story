Ivan Joe D'Angelo, 39, shot Wade Vandenberg, 27, in the forehead from a window after noticing him trying to break into his Melbourne factory 

A Melbourne man who gunned down a burglar at his factory while drunk and high on marijuana has been jailed for eight years.

Ivan Joe D'Angelo, 39, shot Wade Vandenberg, 27, in the forehead from a window in the loft of his Thomastown factory in Melbourne's north after waking to find three men trying to break through his gate.

Mr Vandenberg and two of his friends had been attempting to steal an engine part for his car when he was gunned down, according to the ABC.

Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said D'Angelo should have reached for his phone to call police, rather than a gun.

'You must've realised even given the amount of alcohol and marijuana you consumed that what you were doing was extremely dangerous,' Justice Lasry told D'Angelo on Thursday.

In the hours before shooting Mr Vandenberg on March 28 last year D'Angelo, an experienced shooter, drank up to 42 bottles of beer and smoked 68 bongs of marijuana.

But Justice Lasry said D'Angelo was not seeking trouble, rather it had come to him when he committed his crime.

Part of D'Angelo's defence was that he was not aware that his firearm was loaded when he shot Mr Vandenberg.

The court heard that D'Angelo drank up to 42 bottles of beer and smoked 68 bongs of marijuana in the hours before shooting Mr Vandenberg last year

Despite noting that he was unlikely to reoffend, Justice Lasry said: 'No reasonable person should ever point a gun at another person and pull the trigger.'

Justice Lasry sentenced D'Angelo to eight years in prison for the manslaughter of Mr Vandenberg with a minimum of four and a half years.

A jury in August found D'Angelo not guilty of murder but he pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
