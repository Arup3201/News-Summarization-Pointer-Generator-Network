Lord McAlpine is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile.

Lawyers for the Tory peer warned Twitter users ‘we know who you are’ and urged them to come forward voluntarily or face being pursued through the courts.

His action is intended to stop so-called ‘trial by Twitter’ and, if successful, could radically change the way the internet is policed and make those using social networks more directly accountable for defamatory comments.

Lord McAlpine, the former Tory party treasurer wrongly accused of being a child abuser following a botched Newsnight report, yesterday agreed a £185,000 compensation settlement with the BBC – funded by licence-payers.

Battles: Many have apologised to the Tory peer but his legal team has said that people have destroyed his reputation

ITV’s This Morning and Sally Bercow, 
wife of the House of Commons Speaker and a prolific Twitter user, were 
next in the firing line.

Lord McAlpine’s lawyer Andrew Reid 
said those suspected of defaming the peer would receive a letter before 
action was taken telling them they had 48 hours to respond. He said 
there was a ‘very long list’ of people to whom letters would be sent.

Lord McAlpine, 70, said no amount of 
compensation could repair the damage to his reputation from being 
branded a paedophile. He told the BBC: ‘There is nothing as bad as this 
that you can do to people.’

Describing his revulsion at the false 
accusations, the former Thatcher aide said: ‘It gets into your bones, it
 makes you angry. And it gets into your soul. You just think there’s 
something wrong with the world.’

Twitter gaffe: Speaker's wife Sally Bercow arrived at the Vaudeville Theatre to watch a performance of Uncle Vanya last night. She is facing a legal claim by Lord McAlpine after joining a frenzy of paedophile speculation and is yet to contact them to apologise

The fiasco began on Twitter when Iain 
Overton, managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 
which jointly produced the Newsnight report, sent a Twitter message 
saying: ‘If all goes well we’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very
 senior political figure who is a paedophile.’

The message prompted a maelstrom of 
internet speculation about the man’s identity, despite Newsnight’s 
decision not to broadcast a name that night, November 2.

On November 4, Mrs Bercow tweeted, 
‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’, a reference to the 
fact the peer’s name was being repeatedly mentioned on Twitter.

Mrs Bercow later apologised on Twitter
 but Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said she had not approached them to make a 
personal apology to the peer.

Mr Reid told Radio 4’s World At One 
programme: ‘Very sadly, we are going to have to take action against a 
lot of people.

'The next person on our list is in fact the This Morning 
programme, run by ITV, where Phillip Schofield managed to embarrass the 
Prime Minister... and then destroy my client’s reputation.’

Schofield confronted David Cameron with a supposed list of paedophiles live on air last week.

The Newsnight investigation into child
 sex allegations at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales in the
 1970s was a joint project with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 
which is also being sued by Lord McAlpine.

Neither organisation contacted the peer to allow him to respond to allegations he was involved in the abuse.

BBC director general George Entwistle resigned over the fiasco and Mr Overton quit his job over his disastrous Twitter message.

Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said anyone who had made allegations on social media should contact them or face a legal battle.

Mr Reid said: ‘Let it be a lesson to 
everybody that trial by Twitter or trial by the internet is a very nasty
 way of hurting people unnecessarily and it will cost people a lot of 
money.’

As part of yesterday’s settlement, the
 BBC agreed additionally to pay Lord McAlpine’s legal costs. The bill 
could approach £100,000.

Catalyst: The crisis for Lord McAlpine was all started by Newsnight's 'shabby' investigation into abuse at a Welsh children's home

Newsnight carried a full, on-air 
apology for the broadcast a week later and Lord McAlpine’s World At One 
interview was carried across BBC news broadcasts yesterday.

In the interview, he said he was 
‘conscious’ that his £185,000 settlement would be paid by 
licence-payers, and not directly by those who made or authorised the 
programme.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism
 published an apology to Lord McAlpine on its website ‘for the extent to
 which its contribution to the Newsnight broadcast on 2 November fell 
short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation
 about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by 
the Bureau’s Managing Editor’s tweet in advance of the broadcast’.
