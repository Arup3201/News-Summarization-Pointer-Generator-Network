Revelations: Filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, left, pictured with her mother and Speaker of the House Nancy

Nancy Pelosi's daughter has revealed her mother wants to leave Congress and is only in Washington because campaign donors want her there.

Alexandra Pelosi, whose mother is the House Minority Leader and was the first woman to become Speaker, described her mother's predicament in a phone call.

Speaking to the website Big Government from a friend’s home in New York, she said: 'She would retire right now, if the donors she has didn’t want her to stay so badly.

'They know she wants to leave, though. They think she's destined for the wilderness. She has very few days left.

'She's 71, she wants to have a life, she's done. It's obligation, that's all I'm saying.'

It
comes despite the former Speaker's push to serve as Minority Leader 
after the Democrats' historic losses in the 2010 midterm elections.

Many Democrats - including President Barack Obama - are also 
campaigning on the expectation that she will be restored as Speaker if 
they can retake the House in 2012.

Alexandra Pelosi, 41, is a television
producer and documentarian who won multiple Emmy awards for her work on
Journeys with George (2002), an HBO documentary on George W. Bush’s 
2000 presidential campaign.

The film was widely hailed as fair in its depiction of a president not used to sympathetic media portrayals.

If Pelosi's was to depart it would make room for her deputy and former rival, Rep Steny Hoyer, who currently serves as Minority Whip.

Hoyer is widely seen as more moderate than Pelosi.

Pelosi became the focal point for much Republican ire during the mid-term elections, as seen by these supporters holding signs at a McCain rally in Arizona

In her four-year term as Speaker, Nancy Pelosi has became a 
divisive figure in Congress and she has been the subject of caustic 
attacks by Republicans.

Voters did not warm to her either - a poll found 64 per cent 
of the public disliked her as speaker and 47 per cent strongly disliked 
her whilst only 29 per cent had a favourable opinion.

Always impeccably turned out, Pelosi became 
an influential and powerful legislator and a charismatic speaker who was
praised by Barack Obama for helping get through some of his key 
legislation.

Married to a millionaire and a mother-of-five, she won admirers in party
ranks for her fund-raising abilities as well as her success in uniting 
Democrats against Republican legislation.

But her appearance and demeanour have also been mocked by opponents as akin to Disney's Cruella de Vil.

They also portrayed her as the 'Wicked Witch' of high taxes in a 
television commercial that saw her challenger melt her down to nothing 
with a bucket of water.

Pelosi has long been aware of the rough and tumble of politics and 
recently said that if 'no one's talking about you, you have to wonder 
what you were doing'.

She has also said that personal criticism is the 'highest compliment'.

She
opposed his election to the party leadership in 2006, choosing instead 
to back the late Rep Jack Murtha, despite his ethical challenges.

Pelosi is one of the most senior 
members of the Democrat party and is currently working with Republicans 
to find a long term solution to the US debt problems.

Her
constituency is in California and before becoming Minority Leader this 
January, she was the first woman to be Speaker of the House.

She lives with her husband of 48 years and they have five children, along with the eight grandchildren.

In November, the grandmother was forced to face down claims she took steps to make herself look more junior.

Pelosi was accused of undergoing a face lift to shave a few years off her appearance.

In March, the Italian-American was rushed to hospital in Rome for a mystery illness before being released after 'undergoing some tests'.

Further details of what was called a 'minor ailment' are not yet known.

In January, documents, uncovered by political corruption watchdog Judicial Watch, 
revealed the US taxpayer was billed for $101,429 (£64,000) in Mrs 
Pelosi's in-flight services over a period of two years when she was Speaker.

She also faced intense pressure to resign from moderate Democrats who blamed her for the landslide loss in January's mid-term ballot.

But she said she weighed family considerations with the need to help her party fend of Republican attempts to roll back health care and other key legislative measures made under her leadership.
