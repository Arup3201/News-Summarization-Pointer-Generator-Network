A bullet which shot down the first pilot during wartime - and was then turned into a pedant and worn by him - is due to go up for auction.

Captain Carlo Montu was flying a single-engine bi-plane at a height of just 18 feet on a bombing run over Tobruk in 1912 when a solider shot him, making him the first airborne casualty.

Fortunately Cpt. Montu did not crash, and instead made it back to base where the bullet was extracted and made into a pendant, which he wore around his neck. 

Captain Carlo Montu (front) was one of five pilots who formed the first wartime squadron, carrying out reconnaissance missions and bombing raids during the Italian-Turkish War of 1911-1912

The Italian-Turkish War, which lasted from September 29, 1911, to October 18, 1912 and saw the Italians capture Tripoli, featured the first use of aircraft in conflict.

Cpt. Montu was one of five pilots who made up the first ever wartime squadron under to command of Captain Carlo Piazza.

Italian forces were ordered to attack Tripoli, which was then in Libya, and the pilots took a consignment of nine early wooden bi-planes and monoplanes with them.

The aircraft had almost no armour to speak of, and travelled at only a few miles an hour when fully loaded with pilots and weapons.

Among the craft were the Etrich Taube, which was commonly used during the First World War, and an early version of the Nieuport 10, which was later taken up by the Royal Naval Air Service.

The planes were mostly used for intelligence gathering, and had cameras which could be fitted, but for bombing runs relied on hand-held devices which the pilots would drop over the side. 

Captain Piazza became the first pilot to use an aeroplane during a conflict at 6.19am on October 23, 1911, when he took off to survey enemy positions.

Captain Riccardo Moizo became the first pilot to take damage after discovering a base filled with 6,000 Turkish troops who opened fire, putting three hole in his wing, while Second Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti became the first pilot to drop handheld bombs on the enemy. 

While Cpt Montu was the first pilot to be injured, the first pilot to die was another man named Piero Manzini, and the first to become captured was their commander Cpt. Piazza.

Cpt. Montu (far right) became the first pilot ever to be injured after he was shot by a rifleman while flying at just 18ft over Tobruk in 1912. He survived, and had the bullet taken out and made into a pendant (left)

He was forced to land behind enemy lines in 1912 after his plane developed engine trouble, and was not released from captivity until November the following year.

Montu was born in 1869, and before he rose to fame as a pilot, he also had a football career with International Turin, playing between 1891 and 1898. 

By the end of the war Montu was known as a pioneering airman, and went on to serve during the First World War, where he was highly decorated for his bravery.

Cpt Montu also served during the Second World War, though did not fight and instead advise dleaders on how best to deploy aircraft in battle.

Montu would later go on to be involved in both politics and sport, becoming a proponent of the Olympic movement, and serving as Vice President of the Olympic Committee in 1915.

He also used his experience as a pilot to teach flying lessons, and wrote books about his life.

The archive includes letters commenting on Montu's early aviation course and an autobiography for which mentions his war-wounding and lists his achievements and awards  in civil aviation.

The collection also includes letters from Montu to Contessa Caproni, the wife of aircraft manufacturer Gianni Caproni, who established Italy's first aircraft museum in 1927.

It will be sold by Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions at their auction house in Mayfair, London, on November 13 and is expected to fetch up to £6,000.
