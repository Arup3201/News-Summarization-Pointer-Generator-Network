Ross McCormack has withdrawn from the Scotland squad for the double-header against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar, the Scottish Football Association has confirmed.

The 28-year-old Fulham forward picked up a knee injury playing against Leeds in midweek.

Scotland boss Gordon Strachan has no plans to bring in anyone else for the Vauxhall International challenge match against Northern Ireland at Hampden Park on Wednesday night which is followed by the Euro qualifier against Group D's bottom side at the same venue on Sunday.

The Scots are in third place in their section with seven points from four games with Poland topping the table on 10 points.

Fulham manager Kit Symons said after the knock: 'He got a whack on his knee the first time he went down and the physio assessed him,'

'He came over to the bench and he said he was fine and wanted to carry on.

'But then the second whack on it meant he had to come off. We will know more soon but it is certainly sore at the moment.
