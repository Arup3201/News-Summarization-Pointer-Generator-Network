Alex Mowatt secured a merited point for Leeds United as they came from behind against Birmingham to continue their recovery under caretaker manager Neil Redfearn.

It took the Yorkshire side a long time to get going at St Andrews but a strong second half performance strengthened Redfearn’s chances of getting the job on a full-time basis.

Owner Massimo Cellino, sat in the stands, looked elated when Mowatt showed strength and perseverance inside the box to hold off the blue-shirted defenders and roll the ball into the far corner.

Leeds had trailed thanks to a “netbuster” from Wes Thomas late in the first half.

It wasn’t a netbuster by the standard definition - as in an unstoppable screamer of a shot - but rather because it did, quite literally, break the net.

Taking in a cleverly disguised pass from Brek Shea, Thomas spun into space inside the area and finished adeptly past goalkeeper Marco Silvestri.

But the ball’s impact snapped the net from its stanchion and nine farcical minutes followed as ground staff scrambled to find a replacement.

It caused great amusement to the large Leeds United travelling contingent behind the broken goal and was their highlight in a depressing first half in which they failed to muster a meaningful shot on goal. 

However, things improved after the break and Leeds might have snatched all three points had other chances - from Mowatt and Souleymane Doukara - found the net.

Equally, they may have left with nothing as a late Birmingham onslaught led to substitute Demarai Gray being booked for diving after a clumsy challenge from Giuseppe Bellusci inside the box.

As the home fans begged the referee, replays suggested they had a case and the hosts went close again in stoppage time when Silvestri spread himself to deny Gray in a one-on-one.

The first half had been low key, with Shea, signed on a three-month loan from Stoke during the week, offering the greatest impetus with his forward runs and passing.

Birmingham approached the game having won only one (Brighton at home) of their last five league games

He tried his luck from range early on with Silvestri only managing to gather his powerful effort at the second attempt.

Bellusci, who looked an accident waiting to happen at times, nearly scored a spectacular own goal when a routine clearing header from Darren Randolph’s long free-kick almost flew past his own keeper.

With the midfield uncreative and Billy Sharp failing to fire, it took Leeds 34 minutes to muster their first chance. Mirco Antenucci, who always seemed five yards offside, curling over the bar.

Thomas’s goal was well deserved on the balance of play and Shea’s neat assist a highlight on his first St Andrews start.

Birmingham, who entered the match just a place above the drop zone, retreated after the break and Leeds seized the initiative.

Mowatt’s long-range shot was parried away by Randolph and sub Doukara fired a low effort just wide of the post.

Their equaliser was deserved when it arrived with a quarter-hour to play and, in the week Cellino suggested he might look within Elland Road for his next boss, he may just have a good case.
