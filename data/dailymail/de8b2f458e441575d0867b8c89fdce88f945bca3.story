A swan had to be rescued by five firefighters after it flew into telephone wires in the dark and got tangled up.

The bird was found hanging 15ft up a pole on the side of a road in Edinburgh late last night.

Firefighters took 35 minutes to free the distressed animal, using an extension ladder and bird netting.

Stuck: This swan got tangled in telephone wires in Edinburgh late last night

Attempt: Five firefighters used an extension ladder and netting to rescue the swan from the pole

Safe: The firefighters managed to untangle the bird from the wires in which it was trapped

The swan apparently suffered a broken wing while trying to free itself, and is now being cared for at the Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies.

A local resident who witnessed the action said: 'It was absolutely huge and all tangled up in the wires.

'I had given it some bread earlier on that day and hadn't seen it for a while. A fire engine turned up and I suddenly realised it was hanging from the telephone wires.

'It was really distressing - I couldn't watch. I told my kids to go inside because I didn't want them to see what was happening.

'Swans are very territorial and it could have just been flying around when it got caught. It was horrible to see - it was just hanging there.'

Injured: The swan is being treated by a vet after breaking its wing while trying to free itself

Care: The bird is now recovering after its ordeal at the Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies

Steph Grant of the Scottish SPCA added: 'The swan had become caught in telephone wires above an Edinburgh garden.

'It was around 15ft up and in a great deal of distress as one of the wires had wrapped around its wing.

'As it was wet last night the swan may have been confused and thought it was near a pond.

'I called the fire and rescue service for assistance and would like to thank them for all their help.

'They were fantastic throughout the rescue and were able to reach the swan using a ladder and bring it down to safety.

'The swan is now in the care of a local vet where X-rays will be carried out.'
