A couple from Missouri has seen their family more than double after they adopted five orphaned siblings from Peru who had sent them an email imploring: 'We need a mommy and daddy.'

Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, nine, are now settling into school and home life in Blue Springs, where they saw snow for the first time after touching down in December.

Before the life-changing move, they spent seven years living in an orphanage after their parents died from tuberculosis. The children refused to be split up, making adoption seem unlikely.

But in January 2011, they met an American visiting the orphanage who helped them write the pleading email to send back to his friends in the United States.

New additions: Scott and Lauren Sterling (back) already had two children, Logan, 19, (right) and Laney, 3, when they took in the orphans: Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, 9

When Lauren and Scott Sterling, who have a three-year-old daughter and a 19-year-old daughter from Scott's previous marriage, received the message, they didn't think too much of it.

'I remember Scott and I looking at that 
e-mail and thinking about how beautiful the kids were,' Lauren, 30, wrote on her blog. 'I even 
thought, "Someone rich should adopt them". And then life went on.'

Shortly after, Lauren took a trip to an orphanage in Guatemala and was devastated by how many young babies were without parents while her own daughter had the security of a home.

Then she started thinking about those five beautiful faces she had seen in the email.

'Somebody's got to do it, and why can't it be us?' Lauren said to her husband.

'We may eat a lot of spaghetti. I will never buy another $100 pair of jeans again, and who cares? If those are my reasons, it's just practicality,' she told Fox4ck.

And so they embarked on the year-long 
battle to bring the children from Peru to Missouri, hitting numerous 
roadblocks along the way, including missing identification records for 
the children.

But over chats on Skype and visits to Peru, the Sterlings soon learned the different personalities of the children and began to think of them as their own.

'We got told "no" a lot of times, and by 
then we were already crazy about these kids, so it was a rough part of 
the story,' Mrs Sterling told Fox News. 'And you had to keep trusting that
 we were fighting for something that you knew was yours to fight for.'

With the help of members of their 
church, the Sterlings raised the $85,000 needed for the adoptions to 
bring the children to their new home before Christmas.

One particularly excited member of 
the welcoming committee at the airport was 19-year-old Logan, who had not 
seen her father, stepmother or little sister since they left for Peru 
five weeks prior.

She said she could not wait to meet her five new brothers and sisters.

'I haven't met them, know the personalities, know who they are,' she said. 'I'm excited about that.'

The Sterlings returned to their home to find it had been scrubbed clean by the community, with a stocked kitchen, Christmas presents wrapped under the trees and new bedrooms for the children.

New life: The children are now attending U.S. schools and their English is improving all the time

'People painted beds, people framed 
pictures - people made the girls' room look like they had lived
 here for years. It was awesome to come home to that,' Lauren said.

They also returned to a garden full of snow, which the youngsters had never seen before.

Life has picked up pace in the Sterling household. Scott, 43, runs a lawn care business, while Lauren has given up her recruiting job to stay at home full time.

The children's English is improving and they have started attending four different schools because of their ages, making for some busy mornings in the home.

'The sound of life is different,' Lauren said. 'It's a 
lot more loud and crazy, and half of it's in Spanish, half of it's in 
English, and half of it's in Spanglish. But it's really good. There's a 
strange peace amidst the chaos.'

Moving on: The couple returned home (pictured) to new bedrooms, a stocked kitchen 
and Christmas present under the tree, organised by members of their 
church. They are now moving to a larger home

But life is working out well, and most of that is thanks to the children, Lauren 
said. Pictures over Facebook
 show them grinning alongside their new siblings and neighbours.

'These kids are fabulous. They have great attitudes,' she said. 'Nobody fought me on going back to school the second day. Everybody was up and ready, showers going on their own. So their attitudes are making the transition a bazillion times easier.'

She added that as they prepare to move into a bigger home, the children's biggest concern is whether they can take the carpet.
