Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for Britain to take action over Syria and instate a no-fly zone

Tony Blair has called for a no-fly zone in Syria as tensions heighten between rebel forces and President Bashar al-Assad's soldiers.

The former Prime Minister has criticised the British government's lack of action and failure to intervene in the war-torn country.

He claimed the civil war has caused more deaths - believed to be more than 93,000 since March 2011 - than during the entire Iraq conflict which began in 2003. 

Speaking on Radio 4's Today 
programme, he said: 'Personally I think we should at least consider and 
consider actively a no-fly zone in Syria.'

Mr
Blair also claimed that Britain should help arm the rebels to help them
topple Assad - arguing that inaction only serve to lengthen the conflict. 

He
added: 'A refusal to engage, as you see from what’s happening in Syria 
at the moment, where, after all, as a proportion of the population 
there’s now been more people that have died in Syria in a civil war that
shows absolutely no sign of ending than in the entirety of Iraq since 
2003. So, you know, inaction is also a policy and a decision with 
consequence.

'The thing
we’ve got to understand about this region is that there are people 
intervening. So if we disengage, it’s not that these disputes are 
playing themselves out within their countries.'

Mr Blair also insisted that Britain should also assist the Egyptian military, who last week ousted Mohammed Morsi as president after he failed to come to a resolution with demonstrators within a 48-hour deadline.

Adly Mansour - the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court - has replaced him as interim president as part of an interim civilian administration.

But the Muslim Brotherhood has urged Egyptians to rise up against the military as fears heighten the country could descend into civil war.

At least 30 Islamists were killed during protests over the 'military coup'.

But Mr Blair argues Britain should be getting behind the military, stating: 'The only way you’re going to get back to a proper democratic path is to support the government.'
