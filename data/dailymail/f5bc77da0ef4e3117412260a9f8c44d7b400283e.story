Ironic: While covering his medical marijuana beat, Michael Montgomery accidentally ate high potency pot brownies

A reporter with a beat in the seedy dealings of medical marijuana found himself swallowing a bitter pill as he accidentally got a taste of his own medicine and was forced to re-evaluate his notions of the pot world.

Though many journalists get wrapped up in their work, not a lot cover what Michael Montgomery does.

For the Center for Investigative Reporting and KQED, Montgomery has covered California’s medical marijuana laws and booming pot industry for years.

In 2010, he spent the day in Los Angeles
with a pot dealer turned business woman looking to reap the benefits of
the state’s newly loosened marijuana laws.

‘She let us follow her as she was 
doing her thing,’ Montgomery said in a video produced by the Center for 
Investigative Journalism about the incident.

He’d
gone to the woman’s home, where she hosted a weekly gathering of weed 
enthusiasts. A doctor was on call to write marijuana prescriptions for 
those who needed them, bongs were packed and waiting in a back cottage, 
and food was available, some laced, some not.

‘It was brunch with pot,’ he said.

Eager to capture the ‘remarkable scene,’ Montgomery wasn’t focused on what was going into his mouth.

Thinking he was merely indulging a sweet tooth, he indulged with his subjects.

‘I didn’t really pay close attention…so I ate the brownies.’

‘In a little bit of a hurry,’ Montgomery left for the airport to catch a flight back to San Francisco shortly thereafter.

But when he got there, something wasn’t right.

‘It hits me,’ he said.  ‘I am, like, totally stoned.’ 

Unfortunate: Montgomery boarded a Virgin America plane soon after the brownies kicked in, his first time on the unusually lit air carrier

Montgomery managed to get on his flight, but even that didn’t seem normal.

‘I had never flown Virgin America before this trip,’ he said.

Accidentally stoned, the reporter also happened to board what can only be described as the trippiest of all U.S. air carriers. He boarded a cabin filled by moody purple and pink lights and trance music.

‘I gotta get out of this plane,’ he recalled thinking.

Montgomery quickly deboarded in a panic and found a lonely corner in LAX, where he attempted to just sleep it off.  He even called his wife in hopes she could calm him down and she advised him just to wait things out.

For four hours he experienced severe 
anxiety before he was able to ‘even think about’ boarding another plane.
He’d later learn that the marijuana brownies from the party were of a 
very high grade and even experienced users were encouraged to only eat a
quarter to a half of the large dose confections.

He’d eaten two full brownies.

But the experience, Montgomery said, was an educational one

The experienced marijuana journalist had gotten a dose of his own bitter medicine.

Panicked: Montgomery ran off the plane and spent four hours in the airport that forced him to rethink his views on medical marijuana

Rethink: Montgomery wondered what a 16-year-old in his position might have done and suggested that more regulation is a good thing

‘[It] got me to think a lot harder about pot.’

Montgomery said he now believes today’s marijuana is a far cry from that of 20 or 30 years ago.

‘If I was a 16 year old kid and ate two of these brownies,’ he wondered. ‘Where would it leave me if I were driving a vehicle?’

Right now, Montgomery said, medical marijuana is not closely regulated. He likely thinks that should change when he’s in the San Francisco Bay area he calls home and commonly encounters the aroma of pot.

‘Every time I smell a joint, I still have that slight little pulse of panic.’
