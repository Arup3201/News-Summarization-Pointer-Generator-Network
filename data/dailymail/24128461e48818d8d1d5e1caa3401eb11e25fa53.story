A truck packed with thousands of live cats destined for the dinner table in Vietnam has been stopped by police.

Cat meat- known locally as 'little tiger'- is an increasingly popular delicacy in the Southeast Asian country. While officially banned, it can still be found in specialist restaurants.

The three tons of cats, which were crammed into bamboo cages stacked on top of each other, were seized in the capital of Hanoi on Tuesday but  their lives are still in the balance as police decide whether or not they should be destroyed.

Thousands of live cats destined for consumption were discovered packed into a truck in bamboo boxes in Vietnam's capital of Hanoi

The truck driver admitted the animals had been smuggled over the border from China into the northeastern Quang Ninh province where he bought them.

He told police the cats were destined 'for consumption' in the capital. It is not known if they were destined to be sold to restaurants or individuals.

An officer from Dong Da district police station said that according to Vietnamese laws on smuggled goods, all the cats would have to be destroyed.

'But we have not made up our mind what to do with them' because of the large volume of animals, the policeman added.

Cat meat, known locally as 'little tiger', is an increasingly popular delicacy in Vietnam, although its consumption is officially banned to encourage their ownership

Photos which have been posted on social media, reveal the awful conditions for the smuggled cats which were packed into dozens of bamboo crates, stacked on top of one another.

Vietnam has long banned the consumption of cat meat in an effort to encourage their ownership and keep the country's rat population under control.

But there are still dozens of restaurants serving cat in Hanoi and it is rare to see felines roaming the streets - most pet-owners keep them indoors or tied up in fear of thieves.

Such is the demand from restaurants that cats are sometimes smuggled across the border from China, Thailand and Laos where it is not widely eaten. 

The rescued cats have had a temporary reprieve for the girlsy fate but their lives still hang in the balance as officers said they had not made up their minds what to do with them
