The internet has reacted in typical fashion to today's double blow that Zayn Malik is quitting One Direction and Jeremy Clarkson has been sacked - by suggesting the 54-year-old job seeker becomes the boy band's fifth member.

Dozens of hilarious memes have been spread across social media showing the group posing together with Zayn replaced by the petrol head in an array of publicity and performance shots.

Mostly consisting of Clarkson's head photoshopped onto Zayn's body, other images include Clarkson with his arms draped across his fellow band members' shoulders, or performing on stage alongside Harry Styles.

It follows this afternoon's announcement that Zayn, 22, would be quitting the group a week after he was pictured holding hands with a blonde Essex girl during the group's tour in Thailand.

After five years with the band, the singer has bowed out, leaving Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson to continue as a four-piece.

Just hours previously, Lord Hall, the Director General of the BBC, had announced Clarkson was sacked after the corporation's internal investigation found he had punched producer Oisin Tymon with such force Tymon had to go to A&E.

The corporation's internal investigation concluded the star, 54, launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips.

However, with Clarkson now looking for work and One Direction appearing to have a vacancy, sharp witted Twitter users quickly created a series of memes in a light hearted attempt to solve both problems.

In announcing his decision to quit the group, Zayn said: 'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined.

'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart.'

The Department for Work and Pensions also tweeted about the news, offering Zayn some job seeking tips

He continued: 'I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22 year old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.

'I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.'

The Best Song Ever hitmakers will record their fifth album in Zayn's absence and will continue with the remaining dates on the band's forthcoming world tour.

Meanwhile, the BBC found Clarkson spent 20 minutes verbally abusing producer Tymon in a luxury North Yorkshire hotel before launching a 30-second physical assault that led to another member of staff dragging him away.

Mr Tymon said today after the sacking: 'He is a unique talent and I am well aware that many will be sorry his involvement in the show should end in this way'.
