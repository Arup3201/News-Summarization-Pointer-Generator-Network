A Florida man was arrested for lying to cops in a booze-fueled attempt to keep his girlfriend from moving out.

Matthew Corp, 35, of Tavernier, FL, called 911 Saturday to report his girlfriend was kidnapped by two men, according to the incident report. Corp told dispatchers the kidnappers were headed north in a U-Haul, resulting in a hunt for the truck and a visit to Corp’s apartment.

A sheriff’s deputy arriving at Corp’s residence soon discovered a very different reality.

Book him!: Matthew Corp was arrested after calling 911 to report his girlfriend kidnapped, while she was moving out of his home

The arriving deputy found a car parked out front with the engine 
running, the report said, adding that of the two women that walked out, 
one introduced herself as Corp’s ‘now ex-girlfriend,’ and said she was 
moving out.

Corp soon chased after the woman, who was not 
named in the report, ‘he was obviously intoxicated,’ the report said, 
adding that he became belligerent, yelling at the deputy and both women.

The
drunk Corp then told the deputy he called in the false kidnapping 
report to keep his former flame from leaving, said the report.

The
intoxicated, argumentative Corp then got into a physical altercation 
with the deputy when he was placed under arrest, according to the 
report.

Corp was charged with misuse of 911, resisting arrest and tossed in jail – where he still resides on a $3,000 bond. He does not appear to have a prior criminal history, according to arrest records.
