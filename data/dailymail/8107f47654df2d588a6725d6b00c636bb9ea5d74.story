Stoke City left the Etihad Stadium on Saturday with a famous victory thanks to a magnificent solo goal by Mame Biram Diouf.

The former Manchester United forward downed Manchester City with a 70-yard run and finish to settle a close game against the reigning Premier League champions.

Diouf picked the ball up 70 yards from goal after David Silva's cross was headed clear by defender Mark Wilson, as shown in the graphic below.

The Senegalese striker then advanced up field on his own - nutmegging City midfielder Fernandinho in the process.

He then fired a low shot underneath the advancing Joe Hart - just nine seconds after receiving the ball.

The forward averaged a staggering 17.5 miles per hour during his 70-yard solo run and, despite Joe Hart's howler in goal, it was a truly memorable strike worthy of winning any game.
