The 29-year-old police officer who strangled Eric Garner to death with a chokehold is allegedly 'distraught' over the death, which has been ruled a homicide by the Medical Examiner's office.

Cops stopped 43-year-old Garner last month for selling loose cigarettes and bystander Ramsey Orta, 22, filmed as they tacked him to the ground and Officer Daniel Pantaleo but Garner in a chokehold, a tactic banned by the NYPD in 1992.

Garner was later pronounced dead at the hospital and now both the Staten Island Attorney General's Office is investigating possible civil charges.

Police union President Pat Lynch addressed the deadly incident in a Sunday radio interview.

'I had the opportunity to speak with [police officer Pantaleo], he's distraught over it,' Lynch said.

But Garner's mother Gwen Carr, 65, questions Panataleo's sincerity.

'He didn't listen to my son when he told him he couldn't breathe,' Carr told the New York Daily News. 'My son said it 11 times. So how could he be truly apologetic?'

Lynch went on to defend Pantaleo's actions, saying 'things like this happen, unfortunately.'

'And that doesn't mean to lessen it - it 
means it's the reality. In communities, we have to deal with the reality
 of the job we have to do.'

He also addressed the fact that officers didn't perform CPR on Garner, though he was filmed lying lifeless on the ground for seven minutes until an ambulance arrived.

'That's what they are trained to do. [They] aren't trained for CPR.'

Officer Pantaleo has been stripped of his gun and badge, pending an investigation. Another officer involved in the incident has been placed on desk duty.

Lynch's interview comes the morning after the bystander who filmed the incident was himself arrested.

Ramsey Orta was stopped by police Saturday night, who found him carrying a loaded firearm that was reported stolen in 2007, prosecutors said.

He was later taken to Richmond University Medical Center after surffering a panic attack.

Orta's mother Emily Mercado was surprised by his arrest, and told the Daily News she didn't know he kept a gun in the house.

On Friday, the Medical Examiner's Office officially reuled Garner's death a homicide.

According to the autopsy report, Garner died to to 'prone positioning during physical restraint by police'. Other factors that contributed to his death include his weight (Garner was 350 pounds), high blood pressure and asthma.

Garner was laid to rest on July 23, with a funeral attended by hundreds in Brooklyn.

The Reverand Al Sharpton gave the sermon and praised Orta for corageously filming the incident.

'The chokehold is illegal. But even if you lost your training memory, a man in your arm saying, "I can’t breathe" - when does your decency kick in? When does your morality kick in?

'You don’t need no training to stop choking a man saying, "I can’t breathe" ... You need to be prosecuted.

'Yes, God will make a way, but God expects something of us,' he said. 'When you can, in broad daylight, choke one of God's children, he expects us to stand up and demand justice.'
