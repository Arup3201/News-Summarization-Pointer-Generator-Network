A teacher who reportedly had sex with a 16-year-old pupil who secretly took a video of the tryst may have been the victim of a vicious internet prank.

Various media reported that Lucita Sandoval, a 26-year-old teacher from the city of Santiago del Estero, in north-central Argentina, was facing disciplinary action over the video.

It now emerges the teacher in the video isn't Sandoval, but an entirely different woman from the city of Corrientes.

Nuevo Diario tracked down the man in the video, who isn't an underage student but is actually in college. 

It was also falsely reported  the 'teacher' has several times faced disciplinary hearings over inappropriate relationships with pupils.

The video was posted on a pornography site in September.

Mystery still surrounds where the story emerged from, and why Sandoval was targeted in this way.
