With simple well-cut lines and plain colours, the look is stylish, traditional… and absolutely everywhere. 

For if the public is in love with Prince George, the major clothing brands are in his thrall, filling their new season ranges with outfits that bear an uncanny resemblance to those worn by the nation’s favourite toddler.

Middle class favourites including John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, The White Company and Boden are rushing to kit out British children in copycat versions of his clothes at a fraction of the Royal budget.

The ‘Gorgeous George Effect’ means that garments chosen by the Duchess of Cambridge for her 18-month-old son have helped popularise knitted cardigans, Peter Pan collars and traditional t-bar baby shoes.

Marks & Spencer staff even have dubbed their new premium babywear range the ‘Prince George Collection’, while Johnnie Boden, the founder of the eponymous mail order brand, told The Mail on Sunday that his firm has ‘a Royal baby-inspired’ collection launching in March.

Natalie Carroll, babywear buyer at M&S, said: ‘George has made it cool again to wear seersucker, crisp woven cottons and ticking stripes with traditional motifs such as boats and soldiers, rather than more contemporary designs like dinosaurs and camouflage.’

And with another Royal baby on the way, major retailers are hoping that Kate has a girl – they are already busy designing pretty floral dresses fit for a princess.
