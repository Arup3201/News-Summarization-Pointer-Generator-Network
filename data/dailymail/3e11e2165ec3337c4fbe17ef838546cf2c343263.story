First Lady Michelle Obama could hardly contain her excitement and giggled like a school girl as she introduced a host of Memphis Soul legends at the White House on Tuesday.

Musicians including Sam Moore, Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, Ben Harper and Justin Timberlake were all in attendance for a special workshop arranged for high school students.

The First Lady paid tribute to a style of music with a ‘story uniquely its own’ and could hardly contain her glee at she introduced Sam Moore of 60's R&B duo Sam and Dave.

First Lady Michelle Obama can hardly contain her excitement as she introduces several Memphis musicians at a workshop at the White House on Tuesday

The First Lady was particularly excited to introduce Sam Moore of 60's R&B duo Sam and Dave

‘Watching you all's faces: priceless,’ the first lady joked of the crowd in the State Dining Room as the musicians walked onto the stage.

‘See, you never know what's going to happen at the White House. OK, let's breathe. Come on. Everyone, let's breathe. Even the moms.’

The first lady gave thanks to performers like Otis Redding, The Staple Singers and, 'of course, somebody my husband thinks he sounds like, the Reverend Al Green.'

'Let's just tell him he does, OK?' she joked. 'Since he is the president, we like to boost him up a little bit.'

The president showed off his vocal skills last year, when he wowed the crowd at a campaign stop by singing a few lines of Green's 'Let's Stay Together.'

Later in the day the President got to show off his grooviest 'dad dancing' as he got down to the best of Memphis Soul in the latest installment of the ‘In Performance at the White House’ series.

The President enjoyed the 
star-studded concert celebrating the sound of Soulsville as he and the 
First Lady belted out the classics performed by artists including  Queen Latifah, Booker T. Jones, Cyndi Lauper and Justin Timberlake.

They
were also joined on the front row by daughters Malia and Sasha who 
giggled and shook their heads at their dad's dance moves.

Timberlake leaned in and serenaded the first couple from the stage with his version of the Otis Redding classic (Sittin' on) 'The Dock of the Bay accompanied by legendary guitarist Steve Cropper.

Obama opened the concert by saying: 'Let's face it, who does not love this music? These songs get us on the dance floor.

'They get stuck in our heads. We go back over them again and again. And they've played an important part in our history.

'Memphis, Tennessee, was segregated in 
the 1960s, but blacks and whites came together despite the institutional
racism to create a soulful blend of gospel and rhythmic blues music 
that sought to 'bridge those divides, to create a little harmony with 
harmony.' 

He
noted that two of the night's guests, Booker T. Jones and Steve 
Cropper, helped form one of the city's first integrated bands.

'They
weren't allowed to go to school together. They weren't always allowed 
to travel or eat together,' Obama said. 'But no one could stop 
them from playing music together.'

The President continued: 'And
that was the spirit of their music - the sound of Soulsville, U.S.A., a
music that, at its core, is about the pain of being alone, the power of
human connection, and the importance of treating each other right.'

'After all, this is the music that asked
us to try a little tenderness. It's the music that put Mr Big Stuff in 
his place. And it's the music that challenged us to accept new ways of 
thinking with four timeless words: ''Can you dig it?'''

And
with that, Obama took his seat and the show opened with Sam Moore, 77, half
of the duo Sam & Dave, and 'American Idol' finalist and gospel 
singer Joshua Ledet belting out Moore's 'Soul Man.'

They
were followed minutes later by Justin Timberlake and Cropper's 
rendition of Otis Redding's (Sittin' on) 'The Dock of the Bay.'

The President and First Lady clapped and bopped along to the tunes.

MC in chief: The concert was the 10th in the 'In Performance at the White House' series since Obama took office

The concert was the 10th in the 'In Performance at the White House' series since Obama took office.

Other performers included Alabama Shakes, Ben Harper, Cyndi Lauper, Charlie Musselwhite, Mavis Staples, Queen Latifah and William Bell. Latifah also was the host and Jones led the band.

Earlier in the day, Bell said the concert reaffirmed years of hard work that began in the 1960s when Stax Records was created in Memphis, and the label cranked out one soul and R&B hit after another for more than a decade.

Redding, Isaac Hayes, The Staple Singers, Bell and Sam & Dave were among the company's artists.

Al Green had been scheduled to perform but, about an hour before the show, the White House released a statement from the singer's spokesman who said Green had suffered a back injury and would be unable to attend.

Since February 2009, 'In Performance at the White House' has highlighted the music of Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, plus Hispanic music, music from the civil-rights era, Motown and the blues, Broadway and country music. The series itself dates to 1978.

The Memphis Soul concert was streamed on the White House website, and will air on PBS stations on April 16.

It will also be broadcast at a later 
date over the American Forces Network for service members and civilians 
at Defense Department locations worldwide.

However the extravagant event is 
likely to have Republicans once again questioning Obama's priorities at a
time of stringent government cuts.

Some conservatives have called on Obama 
to give up golf, especially since popular public tours of the White 
House have been canceled because of the budget cuts.

Other
recent casualties of the sequester have been the Navy's Blue Angels 
fleet and the tens of thousands of furloughed government workers forced 
to go days without pay.

Oklahoma
Republican Senator Tom Coburn said in a statement on Tuesday that 'millions
of Americans have been doing more with less,' but 'the federal 
government continues to do less with more'.

Fellow
Republican Darrel Issa, the chairman of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, has also blasted the Obama 
administration for failing to eliminate overlapping programs and other 
examples of wasteful government spending.
