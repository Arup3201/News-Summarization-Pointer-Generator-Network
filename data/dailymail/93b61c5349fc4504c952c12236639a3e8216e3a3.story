Goalkeeper Rob Green believes Monday night's victory over Aston Villa will see the QPR squad regain their confidence ahead of the west London derby with Chelsea.

A brace from Charlie Austin saw Rangers pick up their second win of the season and move off the bottom of the Barclays Premier League - moving to within three points of Villa in the process.

In a game of little quality, it was former Burnley forward Austin who settled the game, but Green also played his part as QPR boss Harry Redknapp saw his side pick up just their second clean sheet of the campaign.

The result may hold more importance for the R's, who face local rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday before welcoming reigning champions Manchester City to Loftus Road.

And Green - who recovered from an illness to take his place in goal for QPR in time to replace Alex McCarthy (thigh strain) - feels he and his team-mates are now ready for the challenges ahead.

'It is pleasing to get the win, I'm delighted for everyone,' he said.

'It gives you that little bit of a lift going into two tough games. If we hadn't won you'd be looking at the next two games with a bit more concern.

'I think games at home in this respect are key so it is that bit more pleasing. It reinstalls the belief you've got.

'Particularly at home, you play against teams and if you really give it a go and put it to teams then sometimes they can't come up with answers.

'We asked questions of Villa going forward quickly, hitting Bobby (Zamora) and stuff like that and it proved fruitful.

'In that respect it is finding a way to win games, finding a way to cause problems and believing in our own ability as much as anything.

'If it means killing games off after an hour then so be it that is the sort of thing you have to do.'

High-profile summer signing Rio Ferdinand was again left on the bench as QPR kept Villa, the league's lowest scorers with just four goals, at bay with Steven Caulker and ex-Villa defender Richard Dunne developing an understanding.

Both scored unfortunate own goals in the 3-2 defeat to Liverpool but were kept at the heart of Redknapp's defence on Monday night, with Green impressed by Dunne's display.

'Dunney is Dunney - he gives his all,' he added.

'He's great at what he's great at and he's a great player to play behind because you know what you're going to get.

'He is consistent in that respect. You look at something like the play-off final. He came off man of the match and proved his worth.

'You could have signed him on a 10-year contract off the back of that game. I think Dunney was in fantastic form against his old club.'

Despite Villa going for almost nine hours without a goal, it was at the back where manager Paul Lambert was critical.

Skipper Ron Vlaar was partnered in defence with Ciaran Clark and the Holland international knows the Villains need to turn around their run of five straight defeats to start breeding more faith among the players.

'It is frustrating to lose again,' he told AVTV.

'We started quite well and conceded a goal - we have to do better that is for sure.

'We have to start picking up points again, results give confidence and that is what we have to do. It is easier said than done but we have to work hard to achieve something and then build on that.

'It is always easy to talk afterwards about what went wrong and what the problems are but there is only one thing we have to do and that is step up.'
