Eric Ortiz, whose spider tattoo led to a memorable mugshot last year, has upped his game by adding a fly in a web to the opposite cheek

For this convicted felon, there's no crawling away from his latest attack.

Eric Ortiz, 25, whose spider tattoo led to one memorable mugshot last year, has upped his game by adding a fly stuck in a web to the opposite cheek, as seen in his latest prison picture. 

Ortiz, who goes by the nickname 'Spyder' due to his arachnophobia, was back in jail on Monday in Volusia County, Florida, being held without bail on a domestic battery charge, according to the News-Journal. 

According to a report from the sheriff's office, Ortiz got into a fight with his brother Jose over changing the bed sheets at their shared apartment in Daytona Beach. 

Eric Ortiz told a deputy that he and his brother, Jose, got into a verbal altercation.

The suspect claimed he was hanging out with a few girls during the prior night and his brother got jealous. 

Jose Ortiz told the officer that his brother woke him up on Monday night and wanted to know who changed the sheets, then became aggressive and threatened him, punching him in the chest.

The alleged victim stated he was not injured and did not wish to pursue charges but Eric Ortiz was placed under arrest. 

Ortiz has a history of battery and fleeing convictions, records revealed. 

Last March, he was wanted by police in Florida for allegedly beating up his ex-girlfriend. 

He was also wanted on other charges including kidnapping, battery, false imprisonment, attempted sexual battery and tampering with a witness. 

Police said in March 2014, that Ortiz lured his 22-year-old ex out of her home, battered her and then tried to sexually assault her in an effort to pressure her to to drop earlier charges against him.

At a previous court appearance in December 2013, on a felony charge of driving with a license revoked, Ortiz told the News-Journal the reason behind the eye-catching tattoo.

‘Everybody fears spiders,’ Ortiz said. ‘That's why I got it. Just to, like, make me know, that that's what I fear, but not to fear it. You know what I'm saying?’

The 24-year-old's girlfriend apparently did not appreciate the tattoo and broke up with him soon afterwards.

He then allegedly put a box-cutter to the woman’s throat and threatened to dump her in a ditch. 

He punched her repeatedly, police said, smashed her phone and dragged her to the couch where he attempted to rape her. She managed to escape when he left to use the bathroom. 

Ortiz's criminal history includes a laundry list of charges, among them burglary of a conveyance; domestic battery; retail theft; violation of injunction for protection and loitering and prowling.
