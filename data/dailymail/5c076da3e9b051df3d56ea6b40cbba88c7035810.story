A disabled man who collapsed in an NHS walk-in centre after being refused treatment had to ring the service’s hotline for an ambulance.

Adam Shropshire had been sent to the walk-in centre by NHS Direct after he rang them for help after a knee injury became swollen.

But on arrival staff told him there were no appointments and he was told to go elsewhere.

He collapsed on his way out and when he came round he rang NHS Direct again before being taken to hospital by ambulance. Bosses have now launched an investigation.

Complaint: Adam Shropshire collapsed in a NHS walk-in centre after they turned him away and had to call for an ambulance when he came round

Mr Shropshire said: 'My illness was not life-threatening - but what if it had been someone having a heart attack?'

The 39-year-old was left disabled after contracting pneumonia and a virus last year. Mr Shropshire, who with wife Tanya runs a pub in Leeds, West Yorkshire uses a wheelchair or crutches.

On March 19, he fell and cut his knee, which needed stitches. A few days later his leg was red and swollen and he felt ill. He rang NHS Direct who told him to go to a walk-in centre in nearby Bradford.

Mr Shropshire took a taxi to Hillside Bridge Health Centre, which is commissioned by NHS Bradford and Airedale but run by a private firm.

On arriving just after 2pm on March 24, Mr Shropshire explained he had been sent by NHS Direct.

'The woman said "they are always doing that, we have got no appointments and you’ll have to go elsewhere",' he said.

He says he struggled towards the exit on his crutches, but felt faint and collapsed in a corridor.

After coming round he called NHS Direct and the operator sent an ambulance. 

Mr Shropshire said he was advised to visit Hillside Bridge Health Centre by NHS Direct but they said they had no spare appointments

That took him to Bradford Royal Infirmary, where he was diagnosed with the skin infection cellulitis. He was treated with antibiotics before being discharged last Monday.

Mr Shropshire is now making a complaint about the centre. Yorkshire Ambulance Service confirmed an ambulance was sent to the centre that afternoon.

A spokeswoman for Local Care Direct, which runs the facility, said: 'We treat any incident reported to us very seriously and although we have not received a formal complaint about this matter, we are grateful it has been raised and have launched an immediate investigation to establish what happened.

'We would be pleased to discuss this with the patient if they contact us directly.'

She said if the investigation showed issues with the care provided, lessons would be learned.
