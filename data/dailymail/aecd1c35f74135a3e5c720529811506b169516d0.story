The 10 stars and stripes floated in the air as a skydiving team came up a unique way of marking the 10th anniversary of 9/11.

Photographer Norman Kent and nine members of Team Fastrax released the flags at 10:28am local time in Middletown, Ohio, on Sunday.

This marked the 10th anniversary of the time when the second World Trade Center tower collapsed during the terror attacks on September 11 in 2001.

Around 10,000 onlookers gathered to watch at Middletown Regional Airport in Ohio and cheered as the team jumped from a plane at 9,500ft.

The weighted flags were released just seconds later - and the largest was 7,800 sq ft, reported Barcroft Media.

The skydiving team wanted to honour all of those who died on 9/11 - and the many other people who were affected by the terror attacks in different ways.

‘It was such an emotional moment,’ Mr Kent said afterwards.

‘Some of the jumpers are ex-military who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq, so it was particularly poignant for them.

‘There were tears as we landed. We wanted it to be a beautiful tribute.’

Mr Kent made another skydive three years ago in New York with the Fastrax team, who were marking the seventh anniversary of the terror attacks.

But they could not carry out Sunday’s jump over New York because of airspace restrictions due to terror threat concerns.

Breathtaking: The weighted flags were released just seconds after the skydivers jumped - and the largest flag was 7,800 sq ft

So they did it at their base in Middletown instead.

‘We were not going to be deterred by threats of terror,’ Mr Kent said.

‘It's a shame we couldn't do the jump over New York, but we were determined to make it happen. In the end, it was an incredible day.’
