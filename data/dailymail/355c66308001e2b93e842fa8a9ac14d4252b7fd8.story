A white teenage mother was stabbed to death and her body dumped in a canal after her married Asian lover rejected her child, a court heard yesterday.

Student Laura Wilson, 17, was killed by 18-year-old Ashtiaq Asghar, having allegedly been lured alone to the canal by his friend and her former lover Ishaq Hussain, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Laura had a brief fling with near neighbour Hussain, 22, and gave birth to their daughter in June last year but he refused to accept the child was his, the court was told.

Laura was killed last October only three days after she revealed to the families of Hussain and Asghar that she had had affairs with both men who were trying to keep it secret.

Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC said the men mounted a 'mission to kill Laura Wilson' and even adopted the language of the cult British film 'Four Lions' about Islamic terrorists in the UK.

Ashtiaq Asghar (pictured) admitted killing Laura Wilson in May this year and will be sentenced after the end of the trial of Hussain, who denies murder

Asghar admitted Laura's murder in May this year and will be sentenced after the end of the trial of Hussain, who denies murder. 

Mr Campbell told the jury that Hussain was 'jointly responsible' for Laura's murder.

The court heard he failed to acknowledge Laura's baby and Asghar was equally keen that his family did not know about his affair with a white girl.

Laura, fed up with all the secrecy, went to tell the families of both men of her affairs with their sons.

Afterwards Hussain and Asghar allegedly sent a flurry of texts to one another.

In the language used by terrorists in the 'Four Lions' film Asghar is said to have sent a text to Hussain the day before Laura died which read: 'I'm gonna send that kaffir b**** straight to hell.'

They even talked about buying a 9.6mm 'shooter' for £400 and Asghar boasted about bringing his 'hit list' out.

In fact, said Mr Campbell, the murder weapon of choice turned out to be a knife, with Asghar texting Hussain: 'I need to do a mission.'

In more language from the film Asghar allegedly said he was going to 'make beans on toast', a reference to the carnage after a terrorist bomb blast.

Mr Campbell said the comment meant the 'spilling of blood' and when the pair talked about 'unbelieving kaffir bastards' - non Muslims - they were clearly referring to the 'mission' to kill Laura.

Mr Campbell said Hussain and Asghar were angry that Laura had brought trouble to the door of their families.

He said: 'She was a loose cannon and they had decided to get rid of her.'

The teenager's body was found in this canal in Rotherham, Yorkshire

The teenager went missing from her home in Holmes, Rotherham in October last year and her body, which had been stabbed repeatedly, was found in the Sheffield and Keadby Canal near Rotherham.

The prosecution say it is likely Asghar killed her when he had a 'golden opportunity' while she was alone, after Hussain lured her friend away.

Before the affair with Hussain, Laura had fallen in love with Asghar and they resumed the affair after Laura had the baby.

Mr Campbell described Laura as 'embracing life with gusto and she was an attractive and popular girl'.

She became friendly with Faye William who also had a baby daughter with Hussain.

They both realised Hussain would never marry them but Laura was only really interested in Asghar, Mr Campbell said.

After Hussain refused to acknowledge and support Laura's baby she became more angry as he tried to keep the lovechild a secret and she believed Asghar was seeing another girl.

Laura eventually took matters into her own hands and went to see the Asghar and Hussain families.

Laura told Asghar's mother she loved her son and 'wanted to have babies' by him but the mother became angry, called her a 'dirty white bitch' and hit Laura with a shoe.

She then saw Hussain's family and told them she had given birth to his baby but they were dismissive.

'Her actions that night brought the truth to both of their front doors and they had some explaining to do to their families,' said Mr Campbell.

The trial continues.
