The Talk co-host Julie Chen spent years living with the shame that her maternal grandfather was a rich playboy and a polygamist, but she was moved to learn that he also selflessly risked his life during World War II and used his wealth to fund a school in the village where he had grown up.

On last night's episode of the TLC series Who Do You Think You Are?, the show traveled to China for the first time as Julie uncovered the mystery behind her later grandfather Lou Gaw Tong's 'improper upbringing' and was led to her family's ancestral home where she met a distant relative that she didn't even know she had.

'My impression of my grandfather before I set out on this journey was I just thought of him as this big successful business man - this rich playboy guy - but now I respect him much more than I ever did,' the 45-year-old mom said of her mother's father, who died before she was born.

Life-changing: Julie Chen couldn't stop smiling after she had arrived in China and learned that her maternal grandfather was a was a highly-respected philanthropist 

Selfless act: The 45-year-old met with Dr Andres Rodriguez at the Singapore Annkway Association, where she learned that her grandfather Lou Gaw Tong risked his life for the Chinese resistance during World War II

At the start of the episode Julie explained that only knew that her grandfather had a dramatic 'rags to riches story' and many wives. 

Lou had made his money by opening grocery stores and later investing in a shipping company, essentially building himself an empire. He had nine wives, six of who bore him children. 

'The stories I heard he liked to live large,' she said. 'I think he was someone who indulged in everything and anything.'  

Julie, who is married to Leslie Moonves, the President and CEO of CBS Corporation, said she was inspired to learn more about her family after the birth of their five-year-old son Charlie. 

'Five years ago when my son was born it was like a revival of me trying to get back in touch with my Chinese roots,' she said. 'It's important for me to have it back in my life, so I could put it into my sons life.'

Julie first traveled to the National Library of Singapor where she met with Jason Lim, historian from the University of Wollongong. During her time with Jason, it was revealed that that her grandfather was described as having an 'improper childhood' - without any explanation as to what that meant. 

She also learned that Lou had relocated to Rangoon, now Yangon in Myanmar, Burma, as a child and later moved to Singapore after World War II. 

Living legacy: Julie can be seen happily meeting with the children who attend the school that her grandfather had founded in 1937

Family history: The Talk co-host also met with the school's vice principal, who revealed that her great-grandfather was a government official 

He was described as philanthropist, which was something Julie admitted that she had never heard about him before.

After discovering that he was a member of the Singapore Annkway Association, she headed to the organization's headquarters in order to speak with historian Dr Andres Rodriguez and learn more about her relative.

At the meeting, Dr Rodriguez told Julie that Lou would bravely travel to some of the most dangerous places to be during the war.

As a part of the Chinese resistance, he risked his life by taking trucks of ammunition into Japanese occupied territory.

'I feel fortunate; I already feel like I've hit the jackpot,' she said. 'To see a document with your grandfather's name with a detailed account of what his role was during World War II... How many people get to say they have that?'

She added: 'I have a new found respect for my grandfather.' 

Julie's next top was to the village in Anxi County where her grandfather was born to visit the Anshan School he had founded.

Long-lost relative: Julie met her grandfather's niece Ke Yuchai, who is actually her cousin once removed, during a trip to her ancestral home

Amazing talk: Julie was pictured speaking to Ke Yuchai with the help of a translator at her family's home in rural China

During her travels, she wondered if the school would be run down or if it was even still functioning. 

'Wow, this is way more modern than I thought it would be,' she said when she arrived at her destination.

The school's vice principal showed Julie her grandfather's name on a plaque outside of the building, which currently has 856 students. Julie was proud to learn that they all knew who were grandfather was.

Because the school was about to publish a book about its history, the administrators were able to tell Julie that her family's ancestral home was still standing. 

'I am so impressed at what my grandfather created in 1937,' she told the cameras. 'Seeing a big picture of him on the wall where these young school children are getting an education because of him just warmed up my soul.'

She continued: 'I was very surprised to hear that my great-grandfather had this idea that education would empower people because I have never heard one word about him.'

When Julie headed to her family's home in rural China she met her grandfather's niece Ke Yuchai, her cousin once removed, and discovered that her great grandfather was a highly-educated government official.

Coming together: During this meeting, Julie learned that her great-grandfather was the equivalent of the head of the US Department of Education, but was left with nothing after his job was no longer deemed necessary

Monumental trip: Julie smiled by the water during her trip to China. She later said it was a 'great privilege' to learn her family history 

She was still confused as to why her grandfather was said to have had an improper childhood when it appeared that he had a privileged one.

It was later revealed that her great-grandfather, Lou Gaw Tong's father, Lou Rulin, was the equivalent of the head of the US Department of Education and was appointed by the Emperor to give the Imperial Examination to young scholars.

But when the Qin Dynasty abolished the exam, he was left jobless with no other career options to fall back on. He died when Julie's grandfather was young, forcing him to enter the workforce when he was just 13 years old.

'It makes sense now that my grandfather had to make his own way in the world,' she said noting that she now had a much clearer picture of her family's history. 

For the last stop on her trip, Julie, Ke Yuchai and her other distant relatives traveled to her great-grandfather's tomb where they prayed and made an offering in his honor.  

'It's a real privilege to be able to say I have been here and take this back to my parents, my siblings and my son,' she said. 'It's very special. It's an amazing family history.'
