Strike laws will be dramatically tightened in key public services to prevent disruption if the Conservatives win the General Election, ministers will say today.

A ban on agency workers being brought in to cover for striking workers will be overturned and a new threshold introduced before industrial action is legal in health, schools, transport and fire services.

The plans, to be in the Tories’ election manifesto, will require unions to get a turnout of at least 50 per cent.

Strike laws will be dramatically tightened in key public services to prevent disruption. Pictured are midwives and nursing staff picketing outside Watford General Hospital last year 

In the core services, a ‘yes’ vote from at least 40 per cent of all those entitled to vote in a ballot, in addition to the 50 per cent turnout, will also be required.

The moves are designed to stop militant action on the basis of strike ballots involving tiny numbers of members, but angry union leaders said the proposals would ‘effectively end the right to strike in the public sector’.

Britain’s biggest health unions have been branded ‘complete hypocrites’ after vowing to press ahead with plans for damaging strikes this month, despite attacking the Government this week for delays at A&E units.

Labour, which accepts large donations from the unions, is under growing pressure to call on them to call off the industrial action. 

Of the 119 major ballots for industrial action between August 2010 and December 2014, nearly three quarters would have been invalid under the proposed rules.

Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, is set to announce the reforms today as a Tory election manifesto promise 

Today Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will say: ‘It is only fair that the rights of unions are balanced with the rights of hard-working taxpayers who rely on key public services. 

'It is wrong that politicised union leaders can hold the country to ransom with demands that only a small percentage of their members voted for.’

The reforms will require a new anti-strike Bill, which the Conservatives say they would introduce early in a new Parliament if they win in May.

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘The Conservatives know that this threshold will effectively end the right to strike in the public sector. 

'No democracy elsewhere in the world has this kind of restriction on industrial action. It is a democratic outrage.’
