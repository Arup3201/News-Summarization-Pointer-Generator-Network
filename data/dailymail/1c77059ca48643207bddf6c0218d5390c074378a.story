The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) has been urged to overrule the "light" punishments dished out to past and present Cronulla Sharks players, it's been reported.

Despite lawyers for the players saying they received a guarantee from ASADA that WADA would not interfere in the sanctions process, News Corp Australia reports that WADA's chief executive is yet to review the evidence from the 17 doping cases.

Former WADA boss John Fahey has said ASADA's "light" penalties made a joke of anti-doping integrity in Australia and he has strongly urged WADA chief executive David Howman to review and overrule the sanctions.

Cronulla captain Paul Gallen and nine of his current and former Sharks teammates on Friday accepted backdated 12-month ASADA doping bans, which will expire on November 21.

They reluctantly agreed to doping rather than face the prospect of an even-lengthier suspension over the club's 2011 supplements program.

NSW & Cronulla skipper Gallen says people can draw their own conclusions as to whether or not he was a legitimate drug cheat.

'You've just got to get on with life. I'll let people make up their own mind,' said Mr Gallen, according to Yahoo7.com.au

Reduced bans have been accepted by Gallen, his current teammates, Wade Graham, Anthony Tupou, Nathan Gardner and John Morris, Newcastle’s Jeremy Smith and Kade Snowden, Titans players Albert Kelly and Luke Doulglas, as well as North Queensland’s Matthew Wright.

The ban will see the players only missing the last three games of the NRL season. Gallen will also be unable to represent Australia in the upcoming Four Nations campaign, whilst Smith will be unavailable for selection by New Zealand and Wright for Samoa.

Cronulla Sharks player Anthony Tupou refused to comment as he left his lawyer in Sydney. He was one of the 17 past and present players to be given doping notices over the club's 2011 supplements program

WADA's Howman has said the matter was far from resolved.

'The matter is not concluded. WADA has not received a brief of evidence and is yet to determine if the sanctions are appropriate based on that evidence and the application of the code,' he said in an email to Fahey, News Corps reported on Saturday.

'If they are not satisfied, we will ask to take the matters to the Court of Arbitration of Sport.'

Fahey was angry over the backdated penalties.

'Nobody has had their record expunged ... they did not hand back their earnings from this year nor did they have their names wiped from the record books as so many convicted athletes are forced to do under the WADA code around the world,' he said.

The notices handed out to players, including Wade Graham (pictured), will only see players miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year's training before the 2015 season begins

The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, according to News Corp Australia.

The notices, which follow ASADA's anti-doping investigation into the Cronulla Sharks' 2011 supplements program, were distributed to the lawyers of players on Wednesday and signaled the authority's intent to charge players.

On Wednesday, Gallen said if he or any other Cronulla player accepted the reduced bans deal offered by ASADA, they would automatically be labelled drug cheats and be admitting to have taken  banned peptides.

The admission could see notices also issued to the Shark's coaching staff for including the peptides in the team's supplement regime.

'Obviously there are a lot of rumours going around the past couple of days - the boys have spoken about it,' Gallen told Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast.

'Our mind and our mood changes every 10 minutes. At one stage we're (thinking) "thank God, this is going to be over hopefully, whatever happens is going to happen and we can just get on with life".

'Because closure on this thing would just be unbelievable (after) what we've gone through the past two seasons.

Players, including Nathan Gardner (pictured) were given 10 days to respond and could ahve chosen to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court

Seventeen past and present Cronulla rugby league players, including Albert Kelly, have reportedly been issued with show-cause notices after meeting with the NRL and anti-doping authority

'But then you say "let's stuff this, we've done nothing wrong". It's a real hard situation to be in.'

Gallen was adamant he hadn't taken any banned substance.

'I'm 100 per cent positive I've never taken anything that's been on any banned list,' he said.

Gallen expressed his fears at the possibility of being unable to represent Australia in the 2014 Four Nations series, before it was confirmed that the ban would rule out the opportunity.

'That's huge - you can't get those games for Australia back,' he said.

'But it's your reputation; it's what I've built over the last 15-plus years in training fulltime and getting to where I've got to in the game.

'It's tarnished now already, but no matter what, if we do this we're going to be labelled a drug cheat.'

Players were given the opportunity to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court.

The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night and lawyers for players like Anthony Tupou were issued the notices on Wednesday

Among some of the other players offered suspensions are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas (pictured), Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner
