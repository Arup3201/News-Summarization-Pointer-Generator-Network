Premier League communications director Dan Johnson has confirmed that plans for a new Under-21 tournament including clubs from around Europe are underway. 

Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday that a new cup competition made up of 16 teams from England and abroad is set to run parallel to the revamped domestic Under 21 league.

And Johnson, who insists the tournament is not a rival to Greg Dyke's plans for a B league made up partly of Premier League reserve sides, has confirmed that there is plenty of support for the concept.

Test: Chelsea's Under 21 side will face European opposition in the Premier League's new youth competition

England: Chelsea, Fulham, Leicester City, Man City, Man Utd, Southampton, Sunderland, West Ham.

Europe: Celtic, Athletic Bilbao, Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Schalke, FC Porto, PSV Eindhoven, Villarreal

He told The Guardian: 'We do believe it would be good for the development of talented young players but it is not an answer to the B league proposal at all. It is something we have wanted to do for a number of years.

'We are keen to work with UEFA on what we think is a good development opportunity and there has been a lot of support from clubs on the continent.

'Our view is that an Under-21 competition with a significant programme of international fixtures at lower age levels is a good opportunity to expose players to this level of competition. We now need to work with Uefa for their agreement.' 

The initiative is all part of the Elite Player Performance Plan introduced in 2011 to improve the standard of young players the top English clubs are producing.

Liverpool, who finished runners-up in last season’s Under 21 development league, have not taken up the opportunity, giving West Ham, who finished ninth, the chance to step in.

The competition will run parallel to the  Under 21 league. That now carries the added interest of promotion and relegation and will see both Sky Sports and BT Sport televise 10 matches live.

The organisers are hopeful matches will attract good crowds and it is expected clubs will field their best young players just below first-team level.

Schalke academy director Oliver Ruhnert helped produce four of Germany’s World Cup winning squad and is one of Europe’s most respected authorities on youth football. He jumped at the chance to enter his Under 21 side.

‘This is a fantastic new initiative and the Premier League have been very good in setting it up,’ he told Sportsmail.

‘You need to expose your players to different types of football and different countries in front of foreign crowds.’

Teams will be allowed to field three players over the age of 21. The format comprises four groups of four with the winners and runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals. All knockout games will be played over two legs and it is hoped the clubs’ main stadiums will be used for matches.

The competition is designed to expose prospects to foreign opposition and take them away from the staid, behind-closed-doors environment of domestic youth football which has been criticised in recent years.

There will, however, be no commercial opportunities during the inaugural season of the Premier League's new European cup and they are keen for it to be seen as a development opportunity; no prize money will be awarded to the winners, for example.

Meanwhile, the name of the competition is yet to be decided, as is the venue for the final.
