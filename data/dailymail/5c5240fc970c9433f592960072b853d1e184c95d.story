Ajax boss Frank de Boer would seriously consider managing Liverpool should the opportunity arise, according to his brother Ronald.

The Dutchman, who has won four consecutive Eredivisie titles with Ajax, has been linked with a move to Anfield despite rejecting an offer to become boss in 2012.

Following Liverpool's sluggish start to the Premier League season, talk of a Brendan Rodgers' exit has intensified and Ronald believes his twin brother would think about the move.

Frank de Boer has an imperious record as Ajax manager:

Played: 171

Wins: 101

Drawn: 40

Lost: 30

Honours: Eredivisie (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014), Dutch Super Cup (2013)

He told Fox Sports: 'If Liverpool come now he would certainly think about it.

'He would certainly not close the door immediately, like he did two years ago.'

Rodgers watched his side slump to a 3-0 defeat at rivals Manchester United on Sunday after making the bold decisions to drop goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and leave Mario Balotelli on the bench.

Speaking ahead of Liverpool's League Cup tie against Bournemouth, Rodgers said: 'As a manager you will always have tough periods but I have great confidence in how staff and players work.

'We just need a little bit of luck and a break and I think we will get that. When we get some consistent results we can push on.'
