They had Paul Gascoigne here once. Towards the end of his career, when the flame of his glorious talent was flickering out, English football’s great enigma spent two underwhelming years at Goodison Park.

Now they have the nearest thing there has been to Gazza in his pomp. If Ross Barkley makes the progress expected of him, there will be nothing sad or forgettable about his Everton career. In one magical moment on Monday night, Barkley showed why he is bounding to the top.

From the change of speed to the ballet dancer balance, all with the ball glued to his feet, Barkley evoked memories of the young Gascoigne, his stunning opening goal setting Everton on their way to a comfortable victory.

Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith scored the others, both with the aid of deflections, but it was Barkley who made the difference. QPR were toothless and Bobby Zamora’s late strike was no consolation.

For Everton, this performance could not have come at a better time. But it wasn’t the smoothest of rides. There was anxiety in the stands from an early stage and QPR manager Harry Redknapp said: ‘I thought they were edgy. We had an opportunity to take advantage. Even at 3-1, you could hear the crowd. I didn’t think they were full of confidence.’

Having stumbled out of the blocks, Everton eventually found some rhythm and Barkley, deployed in a deeper role, began orchestrating their play.

First to test his luck was Naismith but he lacked the power to trouble Rob Green. The Scot was then unfortunate when his goalbound effort cannoned into Romelu Lukaku after he had been picked out by Seamus Coleman.

It seemed inevitable Everton would find a way through but the manner in which they did so was still at odds with what had gone before. It was magnificent. Picking up possession inside his own half, Barkley surged forward and exchanged passes with Lukaku as QPR’s defenders made the mistake of letting him get into shooting range. He needed no second invitation and from almost 25 yards, unleashed a left-foot cannon that ripped past Green.

Barkley has experienced a quiet time recently, his performances attracting some scrutiny, but this was brilliant. With the lead — and with QPR brittle — Everton were going to prove hard to peg back and so it proved.

When Joey Barton tangled with Naismith on the edge of QPR’s area, referee Neil Swarbrick awarded a free-kick and Mirallas, who would later go off on a stretcher with an ankle problem, doubled Everton’s advantage, his free-kick taking a hefty deflection off Eduardo Vargas’ head.

Redknapp stood shaking his head, barely able to contain his anger, while Roberto Martinez punched the air and smiled broadly. Both men knew the game had been decided there and then.

Any chance that QPR, who had scored only twice on their travels before this match, would find a way back were soon snuffed out.

Yet the goal that gave Everton an unassailable lead was almost comical, from Green’s skied clearance to Richard Dunne’s heavy touch to Leroy Fer’s failure to keep out Naismith’s thumping header.

‘Poor goals,’ snapped Redknapp. ‘I had never felt so comfortable.’

To their credit, QPR kept going and they finally got something to show for their efforts when Zamora tapped in after Tim Howard had spilled Jordon Mutch’s shot into his path but, for all that the home crowd panicked, there was never any sense the lead would be lost.

Not when they had Barkley.
