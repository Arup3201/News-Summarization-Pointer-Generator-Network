One of Jamie Oliver's apprentice chefs has been found dead in a garden close to his home three months after he vanished.

The remains of Kevin Boyle, 26, were found in Coulsdon, south
London, just before the celebrity was due to make a missing person 
appeal on This Morning on ITV on Monday.

Kevin had cooked for the Prince of Wales, former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Oprah Winfrey after training with the celebrity chef on the Channel 4 series Jamie's Kitchen.

Tragic: Jamie Oliver with his trainee Kevin Boyle when he was 17 at the opening of Jamie's Fifteen restaurant in Hoxton

Jamie Oliver said yesterday that he was 'deeply saddened' to learn that his apprentice's body had been found.

The death is being treated as unexplained, although a post-mortem examination is due to take place in Croydon today.

Jamie, 36, said last night: 'I'm deeply saddened by this tragic 
news. I am proud to have been able to call Kevin a friend for 10 years 
and he was also a constant supporter of Fifteen and all the apprentices 
and graduates who came after him through the course.

'I last saw him in September 2011 at 
the graduation ceremony for the ninth group of apprentices and he was on
good form which makes this news even harder to take.

'My thoughts are with his family at this incredibly difficult time.'

Tragic: Kevin, who had not been seen since October, was found dead in a garden in Coulsdon, south London, on Sunday. He may have been there for up to three months

Appeal: Friends launched a missing person website for the chef and Jamie Oliver made an emotional public appeal

He had been due to say on ITV's this morning: 'Kevin's one of life's givers, he's a great lad. If you've seen him please, please get in contact.'

It is believed Kevin may have been dead in 
the garden for up to three months after he vanished last October. He was
last spotted on CCTV at Purley railway station, South London.

After he went missing Jamie Oliver had made a national appeal for information. Family and friends set up a missing person website for the chef who was described as 'depressed'.

Crystal Palace supporter Kevin appeared in the final episodes of Jamie's Kitchen in 2002 after being recruited as one of 15 budding chefs when someone else dropped out.

He beat more than 1,500 competitors to secure his place in the final group set up for unemployed young people.

The chef went on to work at various top restaurants including Fifteen in Shoreditch, London, and most recently Vinocteca in Clerkenwell, London.

He studied at Croydon College and Lancaster University. He was also a regular attender at Purley Baptist Church.

The body was found on Sunday afternoon by a resident living near to the scene.

Double tragedy: Christopher Pethick, 20, another of Jamie Oliver's trainee chefs, was found hanged in 2008

Kevin's friend Peter Fosdike went on the missing person website that had been set up for him:

'(Kevin) was witty, intelligent and quick to laugh, but also deeply 
sensitive, compassionate and rebuking of the injustices of this 
world.

'A world that he helped to change for those around him, the 
greater loss is to those whose lives he did not touch.'

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained at this stage. A post-mortem is due to be held at Croydon mortuary today.

'The deceased is believed to be Kevin 
Boyle, a 26-year-old man who was reported missing from Purley, however 
we await formal identification. His next of kin have been informed.'

The chef's family were yesterday too upset to speak about the tragedy.

It is the second tragic death to hit Jamie Oliver's apprentice chefs.

In 2008, Christopher Pethick, 20, was found hanged a few miles from the Fifteen restaurant in Watergate Bay, Cornwall. He dropped out of the course in 2006 after two months with severe depression.
