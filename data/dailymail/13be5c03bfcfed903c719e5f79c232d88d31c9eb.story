Michael Land fraudulently obtained £42,000 in benefits payments and claimed that he was blind, while working as a driving instructor

A benefit cheat pocketed £42,000 in benefits he claimed for being blind, while working as a driving instructor.  

Fraudster Michael Land - who once weighed 420lb - also said he was unable to work because he could barely walk and needed a wheelchair.

Infant Land, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, was teaching learner drivers for seven years and bought a £21,000 caravan with the money he stole. The 44-year-old also worked as a scout leader. 

Land was jailed for 12 months after admitting nine counts of benefit fraud.

Leeds Crown Court heard Land lied to authorities that his eye sight had failed due to glaucoma, that he was suffering from diabetes and that he was unable to walk more than 30ft.

The former nurse also made false claims that he needed a wheelchair, had severe breathing difficulties and required his wife's help to get out of a chair.

Land made the false declarations to the Department of Work and Pensions between October 2006 and May 2013 to obtain £42,203 in incapacity benefit, disability living allowance, tax credits and housing and council tax benefit.

During that period Land registered with the Driving Standards Agency as an instructor.

Prosecutor Simon Clegg said the father-of-two worked on an independent basis as well as for reputable firms including Drive Dynamic, Red Driving School and Bill Plant Ltd.

Mr Clegg told the court: 'The defendant was paid as someone who was not able to work, but also as someone who required care and and assistance with mobility.

'He was also paid benefits as someone not in receipt of a pension.'

The court heard Land was able to buy a caravan worth £21,000 during the time he received benefits.

Mitigating Kara Frith said Land, of Holt Park, was ashamed of his offending and had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity.

She said Land, who had previously undergone a gastric bypass, initially made legitimate claims for benefits but then began to 'exaggerate' his claims. 

She described Land as a man who had worked hard to obtain a nursing degree but his career in the profession ended following a breakdown.

The lawyer said Land was devastated at not being able to return to nursing or his role as a scout leader because of his convictions for dishonesty offences.

Referring to the false claims, judge Sally Cahill, QC, said: 'This was not just exaggeration - this was fabrication.'
