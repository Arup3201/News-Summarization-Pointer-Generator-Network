A woman lost her $4.7million deposit because she refused to buy an $18.8million luxury New York City apartment when she found out it was 'unfinished and had no heat, hot water, air conditioning or gas.'

Roberta Campbell put down the cash on the suite in the Mark Hotel on the city's Upper East Side in January 2008 as the company was renovating the building.

A judge ruled on Monday that the conditions inside, while certainly not what Ms Campbell expected, did not prevent her from moving in on time, and thus didn't violate the property developer's side of the agreement.

'Only in New York,' US District Judge William Pauley said, according to Courthouse News Service.

The contract Ms Campbell signed promised a doorman, a concierge, elevator service, a package room, maintenance personnel, a fitness center, room service and dry cleaning.

However, when she went to inspect her apartment April 15, 2009 -- just days before she was set to close on the apartment -- she discovered it still wasn't complete.

Ms Campbell, the ex-wife of wealthy software tycoon William Campbell, brought along a home inspector, an architect and two attorneys to view the space.

They found 'dangerously large gaps between the pavers on the terrace,' unfinished floors and non-functioning heat, hot water, air conditioning, and cooking gas, according to court documents.

Judge Pauley ruled that the contract protected the developer because it said the company was not liable for 'the interruption, discontinuance or quality of any such services' in the apartment.

Furthermore, the judge disagreed with the claims of Ms Campbell's inspectors and said the developer reserved the right to repair 'minor defects' after the closing.

Pulled out: The Mark Hotel, pictured here, is the luxury building where Roberta Campbell put down a deposit for a condo but later backed out

'The absence of heat, hot water, and 
air conditioning on April 15 did not prevent Campbell's occupancy of the
suite because the relevant systems were completely and properly 
constructed, heat and air conditioning in fact were available, and gas 
service credibly could have been activated within Con Edison's next 
eight hour shift,' the judge said in his order.

Furthermore, the contract stipulated that construction on the building wouldn't be finished for one year after the closing.

Despite
the ruling against her, it all seemed to work out for Ms Campbell in 
the end. She currently owns an apartment at 15 Park Avenue, one of the 
most enviable addresses in the city, the judge pointed out.

Mark Hotel has had just two apartments sold in the last three years. Thirty more are being operated as hotel suites.
