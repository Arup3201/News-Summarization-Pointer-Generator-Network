The three-year-old girl from Mississippi who gained national attention last month after her family claimed she was thrown out of KFC because her face scared customers has flown to Florida to meet with one of the doctors offering to help her.

Victoria Wilcher captured hearts nationwide despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up the claims made by the girl’s grandmother Kelly Mullins.

The Wilcher family continue to stick to their story and last Wednesday they released a statement saying they won’t be accepting KFC's $30,000 donation, but want the money to be given to the foundation of the doctor who agreed to work on Victoria’s facial injuries for free.

Victoria traveled with her mother, Tina Wilcher, center, and Janet Kellum, left, whose stepson is the family¿s attorney in Jackson, Miss.

In April, Victoria was mauled by three of her grandfather’s pit bulls. She lost her right eye and suffered multiple facial fractures.

On Monday she flew from her home in rural Mississippi to Naples, Florida, to visit prosthetist Raymond Peters for a fitting for an artificial eye.

The young girl traveled with her mother, Tina Wilcher, 23, and Janet Kellum, whose stepson is the family’s attorney in Jackson, Miss.

‘I don't think she [Victoria] has a clue,’ Kellum told NaplesNews.com. ‘We are very appreciative of these doctors.’

More than $100,000 was donated via GoFundMe.com and that money will also go towards Victoria's medical care

It was Peters who reached out to Las Vegas plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Stile, who has offered to perform reconstructive surgery on Victoria’s extensive facial injuries and attach the prosthetic eye.

Stile first offered to donate his services pro bono, but the family has now requested that KFC’s $30,000 donation should go direct to his foundation.

The restaurant chain had pledged the money to help with Victoria’s medical bills, despite an investigation concluding that there was no proof that any employee had asked her to leave their Jackson restaurant.

‘The family didn't think it was appropriate to accept KFC's donation, but KFC is invited to make a donation to the Frank Stile foundation,’ Bill Kellum said in a statement on Wednesday.

More than $100,000 was donated via GoFundMe.com and that money will also go towards Victoria’s medical care.

No
 shows: After reviewing surveillance tape from the 
branch the investigators have found that the girl and her grandmother, 
who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the 
restaurant that day

‘The 
family is committed to having the money put in a discretionary trust 
account for Victoria with a third-party, non-family member designated as
 the trustee,’ Kellum told The Clarion-Ledger.

‘They want to make sure every cent goes toward Victoria getting better.’

Victoria
 had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit bull dogs
 ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of
 the home before jumping on her.

They
 dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they continued
 to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend,
 Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage.

Apology: The family shared the alleged story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC was quick to apologize

The dogs then attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs were killed.

Victoria
 was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and 
bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her 
right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Mullins
 and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their 
eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal Control officers.

They have been charged with child endangerment and the case is expected to go before a grand jury in September.

Victoria
 was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return 
home, she continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube.

Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the incident and causing facial paralysis

Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack
