The traditional Aboriginal owners of Maralinga, the remote South Australian outback land on which Britain detonated seven atomic bombs  50 years ago, will finally be allowed back on the  nuclear testing site.

The Australian Government  has officially returned the 1,782 square kilometre site to the Maralinga-Tjarutja people, granting them full access to the land known until this week as the 'Section 400' or the Woomera Prohibited Area.

The owners are now planning to turn the land, which is 500km north-west of Adelaide, into a tourism mecca.

Traditional owners: Maralinga-Tjarutja people gather in the South Australian outback town Maralinga Village to have the final parcel of their homeland returned to them, 58 years after Britain took over the land to drop atomic bombs and test nuclear warheads in the remote western desert region

Members of the Maralinga-Tjarutja community (above, right) attended a ceremony this week for the return of their land which was appropriated for the nuclear testing range

Return of the homeland: Maralinga-Tjarutja indigenous council chair, Keith Peters (left), accepts a framed map of the traditional owners' land from Australian Defence Minister  David Johnston (centre) and Indigenous Affairs minister, Nigel Scullion (right). The map shows a vast tract of South Australia's western desert which was used by Britain in the 1950s to drop atomic bombs and establish its nuclear power status in the Cold War

Fifty years on: A local Anangu Aboriginal boy walks alongside a policewoman at Maralinga this week, as Australian Government officials flew in to the tiny South Australian town to hand back the title to the traditional owners of a parcel of land known as 'Section 400' - the nuclear testing range where Britain launched atomic bombs in the 1950s

The area is part of the 3,300 square kilometres of territory belonging to the Anangu Pitjitjantjara  indigenous language group which Britain appropriated to conduct nuclear tests between 1956 and 1963.

Australian and British servicemen built the test site and an airstrip on Section 400 in 1956 in a region known colloquially as the Woomera Rocket Range, which had been established as a restricted access area after the end of the Second World War.

Britain's defence authorities decided to test nuclear bombs at Maralinga, as well as at another South Australia region called Emu Field and the Montebello Islands off Western Australia, to establish its nuclear power status during the Cold War.

Radioactive fallout: The Anangu people, from the Maralinga-Tjarutja community, gather this week for the formal handover of 'Section 400', an outstanding 1782 sq km portion of their land which was finally returned to them. More than 50 years ago, Britain used the land for nuclear testing, which caused skin rashes, diarrhoea, fevers and, later, blood diseases and cancer among Aborigines exposed to the radiation

Miles from nowhere: The vast region of South Australia's far western desert known as Maralinga was chosen for its remoteness by the Australian Government for Britain's Cold War nuclear tests. Many indigenous people as well as Australian and UK servicemen suffered the debilitating effects of radiation poisoning following the dropping of atomic bombs in the outback

Big day: A local Aboriginal boy climbs aboard the Royal Australian Force C-130J Hercules on the airstrip at Maralinga after defence force personnel flew in to attend the ceremony to hand back the piece of traditional land once used as a nuclear testing range by the British Government

Thanks a lot mate: Two members of the local indigenous community at Maralinga speak with Australian Defence Minister, David Johnson, at the ceremony held this week to hand back the country taken from the Aborigines, bombed by the British and poisoned with radioactive fallout. Australia spent $100m rehabilitating the land

Hundreds of nuclear trials were carried out. Britain dropped twelve nuclear bombs at Maralinga, and then went on to test nuclear warheads.

Although many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their land, more than a thousand were directly affected.

The widespread radioactive fallout of the bombs across the environment, which the local Aboriginal people called 'puyu' or 'black mist', caused disease and death.

New dawn: Synonymous with the atomic bombs that were exploded secretly in its backyard, Maralinga is now hoping to capitalise on its name as a nuclear testing site and attract tourists

Then: Maralinga village in 1956 as seen from an aircraft flying over the north-east of the tiny outback town

Now: The RAAF C-130J Hercules casts a shadow over Section 400 as it flies in for the formal handing over of the land back to the the traditional Aboriginal owners, the Maralinga-Tjarutja community 

Bombs away: Servicemen photographed celebrating at Maralinga in 1955, a year before the airstrip and nuclear testing site was built. Following extensive nuclear testing at Maralinga, both Australian and British military men stationed in the area suffered radiation poisoning  

Anangu people, along with the non-indigenous civilians and Australian and British soldiers exposed to the radiation, suffered from radioactive poisoning, with symptoms including vomiting, skin rashes, diarrhoea, fevers and, later, blood diseases and cancer.

A 1985 royal commission into the British nuclear testing in Australia found the fallout from exploding radioactive Caesium-137 and elements such as Uranium, Plutonium and Beryllium in the desert was three times greater than predicted, and that the tests left 'off the scale' Geiger counter readings 25 years later.

The local Aboriginals, because of 'their unique lifestyle, and often their lack of clothing, footwear and permanent shelter' were particularly vulnerable to radiation; one group became sick after walking across highly radioactive ground in bare feet.

Some land title was returned to its Aboriginal owners following the royal commission. The Australian Government spent $100 million cleaning up the land between 1993 and 2001. 

In 2004, special legislation was passed handing back the title over 21,000 square kilometres to the Maralinga Tjarutja and Pila Nguru people.

The Department of Defence held on to Section 400 as a weapons testing range until this week.

Sign of the time: The road sign to Section 400, the former nuclear testing site, says 'low level' radioactive contamination still exists

The final piece of homeland land was returned to the Maralinga-Tjarutja community at a ceremony in Maralinga village attended by hundreds of traditional owners, and the Defence Minister David Johnston and Royal Australian Air Force chief, Air Marshall Geoff Brown,

At the ceremony, Maralinga Tjarutja general manager, Richard Preece, said his community planned to set up a business to take visitors on bus tours of the traditional area and nuclear test sites.

He said there was strong interest from four-wheel-drive clubs, 'grey nomads' and former servicemen who were based in Maralinga. Tours would begin in April next year.

Indigenous Affairs Minister, Nigel Scullion, told AAP the tourism venture would allow the government  to work with the traditional owners to ensure the land could be used as a foundation for economic advancement.

The Defence Minister, Senator Johnston, said he hoped the handover will provide some 'solace' to the Maralinga people, in particular those who were removed from their traditional lands and relocated to missions.
