Life: Mumia Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence for the murder of officer Daniel Faulkner

A convicted cop killer has sparked outrage after giving a speech to a graduating class in which he urged students to strive to make the world 'better.

Mumia Abu-Jamal spoke by video to 20 students receiving bachelor degrees from Goddard College in Plainfield. 

In 1981 he was found guilty of killing Daniel Faulkner by shooting him dead in Center City, Philadelphia.

In his speech from prison today Abu-Jamal credited Goddard with his reigning love for education - Abu-Jamal received a degree from the accredited, private liberal arts college in 1996 while in prison.  

'Goddard reawakened in me my love of learning,' he said.

'In my mind, I left death row.'

'Think about the myriad of problems that beset this land and strive to make it better,' Abu-Jamal said in the audio message, reports 6ABC. 

Philadelphia police held a silent vigil Sunday in protest of a Vermont college's selection.

Members of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 5 and community members gathered in Center City in memory of Faulkner who was murdered at that exact intersection nearly 33 years ago. 

The Fraternal Order and a state law maker who organized the silent protest are among those who want convicted cop-killers like Abu-Jamal stripped of their right to freedom of speech, My Fox Philly reports. 

The Goddard speech is not Abu-Jamal's first commencement address. 

In 1999, Abu-Jamal gave the commencement address to graduates of Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash,. and in 2000 he was the commencement speaker at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. 

Silence: Philadelphia police and community members held a 30 minute silence honoring officer Daniel Faulkner who was gunned down 32 years ago

Family: Faulkner's wife recently spoke out in outrage of the Goddard College student's selection of Abu-Jamal as their commencement speaker 

Both of those speeches caused protests and sparked outrage from Faulkner's family and police officers, Philly.com reports. 

Abu-Jamal was convicted and sentenced to death after the December 9, 1981 murder of Faulkner. He was resentenced to life in 2012.

However, the case has been riddled with appeals for more than two decades, Philly.com reports. 

Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. 

The case was a famous one and has resulted in Abu-Jamal's long-standing fame.

Fame: Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show, and even has a street named after him in France

Speech: Abu-Jamal has given three commencement speeches in total since his incarceration

Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France. 

However, the city of Philadelphia has not fall victim to the Hollywood picture of Abu-Jamal, Philly.com reports.

Michael Smerconish, a Philadelphia Inquirer Columnist, reported that Abu-Jamal has failed to cultivate support in the city of brotherly love.

'People at home know what happened and don't buy into the Hollywood lore,' Smerconish wrote. 

Goddard College reportedly holds 20 commencement ceremonies annually so graduates in each degree program will receive a personalized experience, according to a Goddard official.

The graduates selected Abu-Jamal to give their commencement speech and the school has received some backlash since the decision.

Infamous: Abu-Jamal is held by many as a revolutionary, however, he has failed to cultivate support in Philadelphia

The College released the following message about the student's selection:

'Many diverse commencement speakers have been chosen to represent perspectives not normally in our discourse. 

'Even if it is unpopular, we need to listen to and engage in difficult discussions. This is what free speech is all about. Our students understand there is great merit in what Mumia Abu-Jamal has to say. 

'It is important that we at Goddard College support this complicated inquiry and the freedom of speech.'
