An estranged father and daughter who started a sexual relationship when they were reunited have been charged with incest.

The adopted girl from Bluffdale, Utah met her biological father who lives in nearby West Jordan for the first time in 2010 when she was 21.

A year later they allegedly began a sexual relationship.

Incest allegations: A 52-year-old man from West Jordan, Utah has been charged with having a sexual relationship with his daughter, who was put up for adoption

Third-degree felony: The 24-year-old woman from Bluffdale, about 25 miles south of Salt Lake City, could face up to five years in prison

The pair were charged on Monday as police claim that they both knew of their close biological connection.

In Utah, Incest is a third-degree felony punishable by a prison term of up to five years.Â 

The Utah Senate tightened its incest laws in 2009.

It expanded the definition of incest and eliminating artificial insemination as a possible defence.

Earlier this week a man from Houston, Texas was charged with attempting to lure a minor and her mother into sex on Craiglist.

In his advert he indicated that 'incest was a plus'.

He
 admitted to not only placing the June Craigslist advert, but to 
sticking up adverts over the past several years seeking young girls and 
their mothers to have sex with.
