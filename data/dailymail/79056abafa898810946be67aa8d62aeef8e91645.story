Swipe: Speaker Bercow ordered the Prime Minister to respond to an urgent question from Labour

David Cameron took an extraordinary swipe at Speaker John Bercow tonight after being dragged to the Commons to answer more questions over the Jeremy Hunt affair.

The Prime Minister was said to be ‘furious’ at having been made to scrap plans for a local election speech on the economy after Speaker Bercow ordered him to respond to an urgent question from Labour.

It is thought to be the first time a Prime Minister has been forced to answer an urgent question since Tony Blair in 2002, over the firefighters’ dispute.

In an angry appearance, Mr Cameron insisted Mr Hunt – whose career is hanging in the balance over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire – had already answered MPs’ questions in an emergency statement last week, while he had addressed the issue in Prime Minister’s Questions.

He restated the position he outlined over the weekend, saying he did not believe the Culture Secretary had broken ministerial rules but opening the door to a Whitehall inquiry or his dismissal if further damaging evidence emerges when he appears at the Leveson inquiry.

Number Ten confirmed that Mr Cameron decided not to sack Mr Hunt, for now, without seeing email or text exchanges between him and his special adviser Adam Smith, who resigned last week.

Officials said that as both men are appearing as witness at the Leveson inquiry, they are not allowed to share evidence. But they insisted Mr Cameron had sought assurances from Mr Hunt that nothing incriminating was contained in the messages, which will be handed to Lord Leveson.

Refusing to budge: Cameron staunchly defended Jeremy Hunt's conduct over the BSkyB affair, insisting there was no proof he had breached the ministerial code

Labour
leader Ed Miliband attempted to draw the Prime Minister deeper into
the row surrounding Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s handling of News 
Corporation’s bid for BSkyB.

A defiant David Cameron 
condemned Mr Miliband for 'trying to use the Leveson Inquiry for party 
political purposes'.

Mr
Miliband claimed the Culture Secretary had committed three breaches of 
the ministerial code but Mr Cameron needed the Cabinet minister to 
survive for his own protection.

'The Prime Minister is defending the indefensible and he knows it,' Mr Miliband said.

'Protecting the Culture Secretary's job while up and down the country hundreds of thousands are losing theirs.'

Mr Hunt's former special adviser Adam Smith, who quit last week, 'had to go to protect the Culture Secretary', Mr Miliband said.

But he added: 'The Culture Secretary has to stay to protect the Prime Minister.

On
the attack: Ed Miliband insisted the Prime Minister was keeping Hunt in
a job to deflect attention away from his own relationship with Rupert 
Murdoch's empire

'The Prime Minister has shown today he is incapable of doing his duty: too close to a powerful few, out of touch with everyone else.But Mr Cameron dismissed the attack as 'weak and wrong'.

Labour pressed for the issue to be referred to the independent adviser on ministerial interests, Sir Alex Allan.

But Mr Cameron insisted that it would be wrong to launch a separate investigation into Mr Hunt's actions unless new evidence emerged from the Leveson Inquiry.

He said: 'As was made clear in his 
statement last Wednesday, in every respect with regard to the News 
Corporation bid, the Culture Secretary asked for independent advice and 
acted on it.

Smiling in face of adversity: Hunt

'He was not required to ask or to follow such advice, but he did so.

'He acted fairly and impartially and in line with the advice of his Permanent Secretary.

Mr Cameron added: 'I have seen no evidence to suggest that in handling this issue the Secretary of State acted in any way that was contrary to the ministerial code.'

Commons Speaker John Bercow approved an urgent question tabled by Labour demanding to know why the issue of Mr Hunt's links to News Corporation has not been handed to independent adviser on ministerial interests, Sir Alex Allan.

Downing Street confirmed that the Prime Minister - who had been due to visit Milton Keynes campaigning for local elections - will respond personally in the Commons this afternoon.

Hunt managed another blunder yesterday 
by showing details of a meeting he was about to enter, dealing with, 
among other topics, the bad press coverage over the lengthy queues to 
pass border controls at Heathrow.

Mr Cameron yesterday offered qualified support to his Cabinet minister, who is facing calls to resign over his handling of the BSkyB deal.

The premier insisted he did not currently believe the ministerial code had been broken - although he also hinted that an independent investigation could take place after Mr Hunt has given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.

He also said Mr Hunt's special adviser Adam Smith had been right to resign over 'too close, too frequent' contacts with News Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel.

This morning, Labour leader Ed 
Miliband sought to broaden the controversy by saying it 'goes to the 
character of the Government'.

Unbowed: Hunt shows no signs of feeling the mounting pressure for his resignation as he travels to a meeting

'People need to know, particularly in these times, that they have a Government that stands up for them, not the rich and powerful,' he told a question and answer event in central London.

'People need to know that there is the utmost probity and integrity in the way that Government is run.

'I am afraid the events of the last week suggest that something other than that has been going on.'

Mr Miliband went on: 'It is a pattern with this Prime Minister, particularly around News International. He resists the calls for change. He resists the calls to do the right thing.

'Exactly as he did in phone hacking last summer, exactly as he did with Rebekah Brooks, exactly as he did with Andy Coulson.

'He is doing the same now when everyone can see that the obvious thing for him to do is make this referral to Alex Allan.

'That is what he should get on and do rather than seeking to use Jeremy Hunt as a firewall.'

Edward Miliband was aghast, appalled,
his eyes two white billiard balls. ‘This,’ he schpluttered, ‘is a 
breach of paragraph 1.2 C of the code!’

My goodness. Not paragraph 1.2 C. 
Smelling salts, Petunia. Someone put in a call to the Tower of London 
pronto and see if a firing squad for Jeremy Hunt can be arranged this 
very day.

You can’t go breaking paragraph 1.2 C
and still expect to belong to a Government, matey, not in this day and 
age. Call The Guardian! Pull in the BBC! Warp factor five!

Commons Speaker John Bercow

Mr
Miliband, champion Rubik cubist, had discerned an infraction (alleged) 
of the rules. His media allies were breathing so fast with the shock of 
it all, they practically needed a brown paper bag to increase the oxygen
supply. Gather, girls, gather.

Labour MPs pulled in their cheeks as though they were attached to the suction duct of a Dyson. 

Speaker
Bercow, who had awarded possibly the lamest Urgent Question ever 
granted in parliamentary history, frowned and cocked his ear.

He could have been a great conductor 
at an oratorio rehearsal who is certain he has just identified a groaner
in the back row of the tenor line. Paragraph 1.2 C of the code.

Well, well. This was going to make the Profumo affair look like a teddy bears’ picnic.

Or maybe not. Yesterday’s comically 
melodramatic calling to the despatch box of David Cameron was, for its 
progenitors, a failure.

They had hoped to show the Prime 
Minister as some sort of scuttling beetle, shifty, panicked, a 
collaborator with the Murdoch regime.

They had intended him to emerge from the session wounded, bloodied, black smoke trailing from his starboard engine.

None of this happened. Comrades, the 
revolutionary  Milibandian-Bercowite plot for world domination has been,
er, postponed. As the Japanese emperor said, things did not necessarily
proceed to our advantage.

The devil Cameron, most regrettably, 
performed rather brilliantly. He did not just win the narrow encounters 
between himself and Mr Miliband.

By the end he had the Tory side roaring its support for him. Speaker Bercow, like Muttley the dog, had been foiled!

The PM made pretty plain his contempt
for the Squeaker’s decision to haul him to the Commons (he had had 
other things planned for the day).

He noted that he and Culture Secretary Hunt had answered questions about the matter only on Wednesday.

Translation: why on earth this is worthy of Urgent Question status, Gawd only knows.

Or as David Davies (Con, Monmouth) 
was to put it: ‘This is more nakedly opportunistic than you’ll find on 
page three of The Sun.’

The closest we got to Tory dissent 
was from Julian Lewis (New Forest E), who craftily asked if we were 
getting ‘value for money’ from Downing Street’s standards inspector.

Dr Lewis put this with just enough drollery to keep Mr Cameron smiling.

The Prime Minister was fired up, certainly, even a little tremulous of hand.

There was a flash of anger when he told Mr Miliband, ‘If you’re going to make these accusations, get your facts right.’

He said he did ‘not belittle’ the 
Hunt business but at the same time simply did not think it matched the 
importance of the economy, jobs, the euro’s future and investment.

It was ‘bad judgement, rotten politics and plain wrong’ of Mr Miliband to make such a bally-hoo about such recherche concerns.

Mr Miliband, for his part, called for Mr Cameron to sack Mr Hunt. It was that paragraph 1.2 C thing, see?

Mr Miliband thought that Mr Cameron was over-familiar with a small clique of powerful people. Never!

Urgent Questions are sometimes held 
as a great weapon in the Opposition’s armoury but recent events suggest 
that they backfire when used in too political a way.

That happened yesterday.

The Tory benches united so strongly 
behind Mr Cameron that the PM was left looking stronger, while Mr 
Miliband was stranded in the position of an obsessive deriving 
frottage-style satisfaction at his Rubik’s Cube.
