A property developer who shot a solicitor in the face with a sawn-off shotgun has been found dead in his prison cell.

Bankrupt Michael Chudley, 63, blamed lawyer James Ward for the loss of his house, wife and livelihood in a long-running legal dispute.

In July last year, a court heard that paranoid Chudley calmly walked into Mr Ward’s office with a sawn-off shotgun and shot him in the face with a single cartridge as the solicitor chatted on the phone to another client.

Chudley was just 10 months into his 28 year prison sentence when guards discovered him.

He was found 'unresponsive' in his cell on Tuesday morning.

His death comes just a week after his appeal against his conviction was thrown out in just ten minutes by top judges.

Solicitor James Ward died three weeks later after suffering horrific injuries

A prison spokesman for HMP Winchester, Hants., said: 'MP Winchester prisoner Michael Chudley was found unresponsive in his cell shortly before 5.50am on Tuesday.

'Paramedics attended and attempted CPR but he was pronounced dead at 6.36am.'

The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman plan to conduct a full investigation.

Chudley was jailed in June for shooting Mr Ward at close range in his office at Morris, Goddard and Ward Law in Devizes, Wiltshire .

Mr Ward, 58, a partner with the firm, suffered horrific head injuries and died three weeks later.

Remorseless Chudley, of Rowde, Wilts., denied murder but was convicted by a jury who spent just two hours’ deliberating at Salisbury Crown Court.

He was sentenced to a minimum of 28 years in prison after Mr Justice Bean said the killing of the father-of-three was 'a chilling, calculated execution'.

Chudley had denied murder but was convicted following a nine-day trial at Salisbury Crown Court.

The jury of seven men and five women took just two hours to reject Chudley’s defence of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and find him unanimously guilty of murder.

Earlier, he had pleaded guilty to carrying an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, possessing the gun with intent to cause unlawful violence towards receptionist Daphne Courtney and threatening to kill Mrs Courtney with it.

During the trial, the court heard that when the armed Chudley marched into the solicitors’ office on the afternoon of July 2 and threatened to shoot the receptionist, Mr Ward’s wife, Nicola Morris, a partner in the firm, ran to a neighbouring shop to get help.

A prison spokesman for HMP Winchester, Hampshire, said: 'MP Winchester prisoner Michael Chudley was found unresponsive in his cell shortly before 5.50am on Tuesday'

Ms Morris heard the gunshot and a shattering of glass and watched as Chudley fled the office in drove off in his Ford Fiesta.

The property developer was arrested 30 minutes later by armed police at his former home in the nearby village of Rowde and confessed: 'I shot him because he made our lives a misery.'
