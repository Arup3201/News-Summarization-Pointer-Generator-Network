A major investigation by competition watchdogs will challenge the stranglehold of Britain’s big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses.

Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals.

The Competition & Markets Authority says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service – reducing choice in the market.

It is expected tomorrow to announce a formal investigation into the personal current account sector, which is worth some £8billion a year to the big banks.

Lloyds, pictured, has been named as one of the four banks, which also include RBS, Barclays and HSBC as offering poor service and rip off deals 

Investigators fear competition has diminished since the financial crash of 2007-8 because brands like the Halifax have been swallowed up by Lloyds, while others have disappeared completely.

Efforts to encourage new small lenders to enter the market have had limited success, with only a few – including Metro Bank, Tesco Bank and TSB – making any real impact.

There is also damning evidence that the banks continue to fail small businesses by failing to offer loans.

It was hoped that a system to help people switch bank within seven working days would boost competition, improve service and reduce fees. However, relatively few people have done so.

Richard Lloyd of Which? said: ‘Quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition. It is clear that the big banks’ stranglehold on the market continues and that quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition or trust in banking.

‘The Competition & Markets Authority must expose what’s at the heart of the problems in this market and propose reform so that it works better for consumers.’

He said the public need access to clear information on the running costs of current accounts so they can decide whether to switch.

Official surveys show that satisfaction levels with the big four banks are less than 60 per cent yet their market shares have remained stable.

There are concerns that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £20 in return for perks of little value (file picture) 

Customers find it very difficult to make comparisons between them, reducing competition and driving up charges, particularly on overdrafts. The greatest evidence of the failure of competition came with the fiasco surrounding the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

The big four banks have had to set aside around £22billion in compensation, but only after they were forced.

And for many years, the banks routinely rejected many customer complaints about PPI and other issues, forcing people to turn to the Financial Ombudsman Service. According to recent figures, up to eight in ten complaints about the mis-sold PPI cover received by the ombudsman were first unfairly thrown out by the bank concerned.

The FOS is now beginning to see a growing number of complaints about paid-for packaged current accounts.

There are concerns that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £20 in return for perks of little value, such as travel policies, breakdown cover and mobile phone insurance – which have led to a 248 per cent increase in complaints.

If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider.

Tesco Bank's Current Account gives customers 3 per cent interest on balances of up to £3,000. Spending on the account's debit card also clocks up Tesco Clubcard points. It pays one Clubcard point for every £4 spent in Tesco stores plus £8 you spend out of Tesco,
