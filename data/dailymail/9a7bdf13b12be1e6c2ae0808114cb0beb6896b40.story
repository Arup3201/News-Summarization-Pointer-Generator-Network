It’s a point of contention when thousands of Christmas markets pop up across Europe every holiday season – which one is the greatest of them all?

A poll of nearly 72,000 people has tried to bring an end to the conflict – naming the festive market in Strasbourg, France as Europe’s best.

With so much competition one of the most surprising inclusions on the top ten list may be Manchester, which placed ninth behind traditional favourites in Germany, Austria and France, but finished ahead of London.

Europe's best: Strasbourg's Christmas market topped a vote held by a Brussels-based tourism group

Billed by some as ‘the capital of Christmas’, Strasbourg’s market is one of the oldest in Europe, with the first being held in 1570. Today, organisers say it attracts two million locals and tourists every year.

It topped the list in a vote held by Brussels-based tourism organisation European Best Destinations, and it was followed by Aachen in Germany, Vienna, Nuremberg and Lille.

Rounding out the top ten were Dresden, Brussels, Cologne, Manchester and Prague.

London was one of the options in the vote, which drew ballots from more than 80 countries, but it failed to crack the top ten.

In an online poll, voters said they chose Manchester's market because it is traditional and modern and it ‘goes beyond the borders of the UK’.

Councillor Pat Karney told the Manchester Evening News: ‘We’ve said it for years and now it’s official. 

'Once again Manchester has been named the best Christmas market in the UK and one of the best in Europe and the world.' 

Manchester's Christmas market placed ninth, beating London as voters chose from 15 cities

Mr Karney added: ‘We have welcomed visitors from across the world who have travelled to the city just to see the Christmas markets – but of course, once they are here, they fall in love with Manchester too.’

Open until December 21, Manchester’s Christmas market attracted an estimated 200,000 people on its opening weekend.

So far visitors have taken home nearly 100,000 mulled wine mugs and consumed tens of thousands of bratwurst sausages.
