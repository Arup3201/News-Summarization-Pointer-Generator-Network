A great-grandmother was left screaming in agony on a hospital ward while a doctor played a computer game, an inquest was told.

Relatives begged staff to ask him to make 81-year-old Sadie Gray more comfortable, but they refused, saying he was off duty.

Mrs Gray had to wait 90 minutes before another doctor arrived to give her morphine. The pensioner, who had undergone bowel surgery, died less than three weeks later as a result of complications from the operation.

A coroner ruled that while she had suffered poor nursing care, her death was ultimately down to what happened during surgery.

But her family yesterday condemned a  ‘catalogue of errors’, including the failure of ward staff to ask the off-duty doctor to help. They are considering legal action.

Details of Mrs Gray’s ordeal came on the day the Mail revealed that a whistleblower who exposed NHS failures had been cleared of wrongdoing – after a 13-year legal battle that cost the taxpayer £10 million.

Ironically, Mrs Gray had chosen to avoid Tameside General Hospital near her home in Denton, Greater Manchester, because of concern over its treatment of elderly patients. Instead she was admitted to Manchester Royal Infirmary in December 2012 and underwent surgery for a perforated bowel.

But she spent seven months in hospital, with her family facing ‘a constant battle’ to ensure she was well cared for. Finally, last June, she was prepared for discharge and underwent further surgery to insert a feeding tube, the inquest heard.

But after returning to the ward, Mrs Gray began screaming in pain and vomiting, relatives told the hearing, becoming delirious and pleading with them to send an ambulance to the ward.

Her son, Gary, 52, said he went to reception to ask for someone to prescribe her pain relief, but was told that the doctor sitting just outside the ward could not help.

‘There was a doctor playing on a computer in the corridor,’ he said. ‘The receptionist said he wasn’t on this morning. He was sat right outside the room. She was screaming in pain.’

Mrs Gray was finally given morphine, but even then the doctor did not examine her, her family told the inquest in Manchester. Tragically it emerged her bowel had again been perforated during the operation and she died on June 28.

The hospital later gave the family a 41-page report showing lapses in nursing care, including pain management, nutrition and hydration, infection prevention and record-keeping in the months leading up to her death. Anne Woodward, lead nurse in surgery, told the inquest the report showed the hospital had taken the issue seriously.

But Mrs Gray’s daughter, Susan Carter, told Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows she was convinced her mother ‘could be alive today’ if she had received better care.

Mr Meadows ruled in a narrative verdict that Mrs Gray had died from multi-organ failure following complications after bowel surgery. But he added: ‘I can see there has been a number of failures in nursing care.’

A spokesman for Central Manchester University Hospitals Trust said: ‘Mrs Gray was given pain relief immediately after her procedure and a doctor was then called to provide a stronger painkiller and attended to Mrs Gray an hour and a half later. Another doctor who was present on the ward at the time was from a visiting speciality and not familiar with Mrs Gray.’
