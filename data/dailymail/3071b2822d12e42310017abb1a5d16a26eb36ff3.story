A mental health worker who inspired Pulp's Disco 2000 has died after losing a battle to cancer.

Deborah Bone, who was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in January 2013, passed away on December 30, shortly after she learned she had been honoured with an MBE.

The New Year's Honours list was announced just a few hours after her death.  

Born in Sheffield, she was a close childhood friend of Pulp lead singer Jarvis Cocker, pictured together, who sang the 90s hit, which repeatedly mentions her name

Born in Sheffield, she was a close childhood friend of Pulp lead singer Jarvis Cocker, who sang the 90s hit, which repeatedly mentions her name.

The song, which reached number seven in 1995, features the lyrics: 'Well we were born within one hour of each other.

'Our mothers said we could be sister and brother. Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya.' 

Cocker reportedly sang Disco 2000 at her 50th birthday party. 

The 51-year-old, who set up the Step2 health service for the Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust in Stevenage, had been battling multiple myeloma. 

Mrs Bone, from Letchworth, Hertfordshire, used a blog to document her battle with cancer. 

In one of her last posts, in November last year, she wrote: 'Your strength is my strength. I have been wrapped in a blanket of love and appreciate all your comments even if I don’t always respond. 

'It all makes such a difference to my mental well being.

'I'm looking forward to Christmas and the birth of my second grandchild in February.'

Deborah Bone passed away on December 30, shortly after she learned she had been honoured with an MBE

She developed the Brainbox, a visual resource to help young people cope with high stress and anxiety, and was also the co-creator of the award-winning Bright Stars programme which is used in primary schools across Hertfordshire.

Her MBE was awarded for services to children and young people in recognition of such feats. 

She is survived by husband Colin, daughters Jemima and Pollyanna, grandson Elliot and a soon to be born granddaughter Lucy. 

Mrs Bone's family paid tribute to her on her blog, describing her as an 'inspirational woman'.

They said: 'Thank you for taking the time to share in this journey with Deborah and our family.

'We are sorry to let you know that after a brave fight, Deborah passed away on December 30th, peacefully at home. She loved life and fought to the end.

'Deborah was a truly inspirational woman, always putting other people before herself. 

'She worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those around her and it is with great pride we can tell you that in the New Years honours list 2015 she received an MBE for her services to children's mental health.

'She leaves behind a loving family – her two beautiful daughters, grandson and husband who all miss her greatly and will continue to follow in her footsteps.

'As a family, we would like to thank you all for the support and kind wishes. 

'We will be creating a book of our Mummy's life and memories. Please could you share any photographs, notes or thoughts with us so together we can forever honour her memory.'

Pulp's Disco 2000 repeats the name Deborah frequently and features the lyrics: 'Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya'

Her husband Colin told the Stevenage Comet: 'Learning Deborah had been awarded an MBE was a very emotional experience. 

'Her first thoughts characteristically were for the other people who helped to make her achievements possible.

'I shall be so proud to attend the MBE award ceremony on her behalf accompanied by her daughter Pollyanna who is following in her mother’s footsteps working for the NHS and already achieving national recognition.'

Mrs Bone's funeral will be held on January 16 in St Nicholas's Church Hinxworth, Hertfordshire.

The family have asked for donations to be made to Young Minds 'to enable Deborah continue her passion to improve children's mental health.'

A still from Pulp's Disco 2000, sung by Jarvis Cocker, about a girl named Deborah

Well we were born within one hour of each other

Our mothers said we could be sister and brother

Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya

Oh they thought that when we grew up we'd get married, never split up

We never did it although often I thought of it

Oh Deborah do you recall

Your house was very small with wood chip on the wall

When I came around to call you didn't notice me at all

I said let's all meet up in the year 2000

Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown

Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road

I never knew that you'd get married

I would be living down here on my own on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago
