Dane Kowalski, who was found dead after he desperately tried to free his vehicle as it got bogged down, left a tragic note behind his family has revealed.

The 27-year-old's mother Vera Kowalski told The Sunday Mail that her son had penned his last words: 'I have been bitten by a snake' on a  cardboard note found near the ute.

The details have been revealed after the Melbourne plumber's body was found about 350 metres from his ute on Friday on a deserted highway in the South Australian outback, three months after he vanished.

The note suggests Mr Kowalski was bitten after scouring through scrubland to find sticks to place under his tyres for traction when his four-wheel-drive became stuck.
