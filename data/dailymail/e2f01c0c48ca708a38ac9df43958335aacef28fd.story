Jewellery collectors who don't mind if their gems have a shady past will soon get the chance to bid on a stash of valuables found in the home of reputed mobster Frank Calabrese Sr.

Federal agents raided Calabrese's home in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook two years ago and found a hoard of jewellery, guns and cash in a secret compartment behind a family portrait.

Now, an online auction house in Texas plans to sell the items, which are valued at more than $500,000 and include more than 250 loose diamonds, earrings, engagement rings, luxury watches and other jewellery.

Knives out: A hoard of jewellry, gold, and diamonds, as well as vintage pocket knives such as these will be sold by an online auction house after they were found at the home of reputed mobster Frank Calabrese Sr.

Reputed mobster Frank Calabrese Sr., was convicted in 2009 in a racketeering conspiracy that included 18 decades-old murders

'He's got lots of diamonds,' said Bob Sheehan, owner of the Gaston & Sheehan, which will hold the online public auction July 10-24.Calabrese is currently behind bars.

He was one of several reputed mobsters convicted in 2009 in a racketeering conspiracy that included 18 decades-old murders. 

He was blamed for 13, sentenced to life in prison and ordered to pay more than $24 million. The auction proceeds will go toward that restitution.

During his trial, Calabrese bragged that he made millions on the street and was known among his family for stashing valuables.

It isn't clear where Calabrese got all of the jewellery. 

Defence attorney Joseph Lopez described Calabrese - who accepted items in lieu of cash while doing business as a loan shark - as 'a collector.'

Next month's auction is the second sale of items from Calabrese's home. 

Last year, Gaston & Sheehan sold more than 100 rare $500 and $1,000 bills from Calabrese's stash.

According to court records, that sale brought in $245,860.

Ornate: These gold watches are engraved with an 'F' and a 'C' - most likely in the name of their previous owner

Watch it: Two vintage gold watches, one engraved with a fish pattern, and another with Frank Calabrese's initials, are on the auctioning block

Where it all began: A secret storage space in the home of reputed mobster Frank Calabrese Sr, in Oak Brook, Illinois, had much of the fortune hidden behind a portrait
