India was on Thursday grappling with the task of establishing contact with those responsible for the abduction of 40 Indian construction workers in the war-torn Iraqi city of Mosul, which has become the first foreign policy challenge of the new NDA government.

The Iraq government has traced the location of the kidnapped men, who mostly belong to Punjab and other parts of northern India, but there was little clarity on who was holding them. In an indirect expression of concern about the well-being of the men, the External Affairs Ministry spokesperson said there was "no safety in captivity".

A crisis management group formed by the Foreign Ministry met twice on Thursday - with both meetings personally chaired by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj - to take stock of the options and to assess the safety and security of all the Indians in Iraq.

As more details emerged from Iraq, it became apparent that the Indian workers, employed by the Baghdad-based Tariq Noor Al-Huda Construction Company, were abducted on Sunday.

This was a full three days before the government confirmed the kidnappings.

Sources said the men were captured while they were apparently being moved out of the second largest city of Mosul, overrun by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) last week.

The families of several kidnapped men from Punjab have also said that their last contact with them was on Sunday. Though media reports claimed the abducted men were safe and would even be handed over to any representative of the Indian government, the Foreign Ministry said the Iraqi government had confirmed they were in custody.

The initial information, based on inputs from the Red Crescent, about the kidnappings had been "reconfirmed by the Iraq government", Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.

The CRISIS management group, formed by the External Affairs Ministry to oversee efforts to rescue the 40 Indians abducted in Iraq and to arrange the evacuation of other Indians, is headed by Secretary (East) Anil Wadhwa.

It was formed on Tuesday after reports emerged that nearly 90 Indians were stranded in Iraq.

On Thursday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj personally chaired two meetings of the group.

The other members of the crisis management group are Joint Secretary (Gulf) Mridul Kumar, Joint Secretary (WANA) Sandeep Kumar and Joint Secretary (Americas) Vikram Doraiswami.Â 

Asked if the Indians were safe, he said: "There is no safety in captivity. Safety is when people are in places where they are welcome."

He added: "We have been informed by Iraq's Foreign Ministry that they have been able to determine the location where these abducted Indian nationals are being held captive with workers of a few other nationalities."

Though he did not give details, sources said the other detained persons included Turkish and Bangladeshi nationals. He refused to provide details of the location where the Indians are being held "or what the Iraqis have shared with us in terms of possibilities".

Suresh Reddy, India's former envoy to Iraq, arrived in Baghdad on Thursday to reinforce efforts to secure the release of the kidnapped men and to facilitate the evacuation of Indian nationals.

Reddy, believed to have key contacts in the government and local tribal leaders, participated in several meetings during the day.

Saleh Dabbakeh, spokesperson of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Iraq, told Mail Today that there was little information about the Indians in Mosul.

He said the 46 nurses from Kerala stranded at a teaching hospital in Tikrit were "fine". The parties to the conflict included the ISIS, other armed groups and tribal leaders, he said.

There are an estimated 10,000 Indians living across Iraq, but the External Affairs Ministry says only a little over 100 are in areas affected by violence, including the 40 kidnapped men.

Iraqi soldiers and helicopter gunships battled Sunni militants for a third day on Thursday for control of Iraq's largest oil refinery, the loss of which would be a devastating symbol of the Baghdad government's powerlessness in the face of a determined insurgency hostile to the West.

The two sides held different parts of the Baiji facility, which extends over several square kilometres of desert. The facility, which was shut down, normally produces about 300,000 barrels per day, strictly for domestic consumption.

The militants, led by the al-Qaeda-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), clearly hope to get millions of dollars in revenue from operating the refinery.

More broadly, however, capturing the facility could weaken Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's hold on power by calling into question his ability to stop the militants' advance anywhere in Iraq.

In the strongest sign yet of US doubts about Iraq's stability, the Obama administration is weighing whether to press the Shiite PM to step down in a last-ditch effort to prevent disgruntled Sunnis from igniting a full-scale civil war.

President Barack Obama on Thursday said the US is prepared to take targeted military actions in Iraq if they would help fight a growing threat from extremist militants.

He also said the US is ready to send as many as 300 military advisers to Iraq.

A witness who drove past the Baiji facility, some 250km north of Baghdad, said the militants manned checkpoints around it and hung their black banners on watchtowers.

One of the militants laying siege to the refinery confirmed over phone that the facility remained in government hands, saying that helicopter gunships slowed the insurgents' advance.
