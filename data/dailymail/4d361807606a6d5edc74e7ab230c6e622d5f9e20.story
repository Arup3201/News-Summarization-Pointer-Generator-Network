A Pennsylvania man is facing child welfare charges for allegedly leaving his seven-year-old son alone in a vehicle outside of a casino Tuesday while he gambled, police say.

Police say that Bryan Bolds, 32, of Philadelphia, was inside Parx Casino in Bensalem for nearly three hours gambling while his son sat in the car unattended.

Lt. William McVey, with the Bensalem Police Department, told ABC that a passer-by noticed the child in the vehicle alone yelling for his father and alerted police. That was around 3.30pm.

Officers Immediately took the child to police headquarters and attempted to locate his father.

'We then monitored [Bolds] on Parx security cameras playing blackjack for the next three hours,' McVey said.

'He never made any attempt to go to the vehicle.' 

Bolds was arrested at a gaming table and charged with Endangering the Welfare of a Child, CBS reports.

Father: Around 3.30pm, a passer-by noticed the child in the vehicle (photographed) alone yelling for his father and alerted police

McVey said the seven-year-old did not suffer any injuries but was shaken up, he has since been reunited with his mother.

Meanwhile, Bolds has been ordered not to have any contact with his son and is being held at the Bucks County Correctional Facility on 10 percent of $70,000 bail. 

McVey said that children being left unattended is something the department takes very seriously and asks that parents planning to gamble make arrangements to keep their children at home and care for them properly.
