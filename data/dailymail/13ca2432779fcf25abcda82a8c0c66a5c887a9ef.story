Russia has revealed it will develop an array of new weapons - including nuclear warheads - amid the escalating stand-off with the West over its involvement in Ukraine.

President Vladimir Putin revealed the move after Nato set up a 'spearhead' force to defend eastern Europe against what it describes as growing evidence of a Russian presence in Ukraine.

He told a Kremlin meeting western nations should not get 'hysterical' about the re-arming, insisting the prospect of Russia entering a Cold War style arms race was 'absolutely excluded'.

Tension: Vladimir Putin, pictured at a Moscow church today, has vowed to ramp up Russia's nuclear arsenal

Overrun: Ukraine and the West say pro-Russian rebels, like the one pictured today in the key city of Donetsk, have been receiving support from Russia and more than 1,000 Russian troops have been on Ukrainian soil

But he said U.S. missile defence plans had challenged Russia's security and his nation would rise to defend itself if necessary.

In the speech - made on the same day Russia's military successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile from a nuclear submarine - he said: 'We have warned many times that we would have to take corresponding countermeasures to ensure our security.

'I would like to underline that we only take retaliatory steps.'

The statement appeared to signal that the Russian leader is determined to pursue a tough course in the face of more Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.

Relations between Russia and the West have plummeted to their lowest point since the Cold War after eastern Ukraine, where many people are ethnically Russian, was overrun by pro-Russian rebels.

There have been repeated claims - denied by Putin - that Russia is encouraging the unrest in order to allow an invasion in the guise of a humanitarian mission. 

The European Union is mulling a new wave of sanctions against Russia, intended to persuade it to honour its part of a cease-fire agreement signed last week.

Moscow denies sending troops into eastern Ukraine, but leaders in the capital Kiev and Western backers say there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

At one point Nato estimated there were 1,000 Russian troops on Ukrainian soil. 

Today Ukraine's president said Russia had removed '70 per cent' of its forces from his country, raising hopes for peace after a five-month conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people.

President Petro Poroshenko said parts of the east under rebel control would get special status under a peace deal.

'According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70 percent of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,' he said.

'This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.'

He added 700 Ukrainian prisoners had been freed from rebel captivity and expressed hope that another 500 would be freed by the end of the week.

But he said the ceasefire was not easy to maintain because 'terrorists' were constantly trying to provoke Kiev's forces.

In today's speech, which addressed Russia's weapons modernisation programme from 2016 to 2025, Putin said the military had to replace Soviet weapons approaching the end of their useful lifespan. 

He said the country should focus on building a new array of offensive weapons to provide a 'guaranteed nuclear deterrent'.

The plans also involve re-arming strategic and long-range aviation; creating an aerospace defence system and developing high-precision non-nuclear weapons.

He would not elaborate on the type of weapons, but he and other officials have repeatedly boasted about new Russian nuclear missiles' capability to penetrate any prospective missile shield. 

The Kremlin's current modernisation programme, to 2020, is already costing £330billion.

Russia inherited most of its arsenal from the Soviet Union and has struggled to develop new weapons systems after the post-Soviet industrial meltdown. 

The difficulties faced by the Russian arms industry have been highlighted by the long and painful development of the Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile, which suffered repeated launch failures.

But its designers finally seem to have cured the glitches, and the navy boasted of a successful launch of the Bulava from a nuclear submarine today.  

Talking about potential threats, the Russian president specifically pointed at the U.S. missile defense program and Washington's plans to develop new conventional weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world in as little as an hour with deadly precision.
