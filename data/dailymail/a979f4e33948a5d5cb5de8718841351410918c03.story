Mysterious: Someone uploaded a PDF version of this book of three previously unpublished and largely unseen J.D. Salinger stories

After years of remaining unseen by nearly all his fans, three stories by reclusive author J.D. Salinger leaked online Wednesday.

The unpublished stories were once only available for academics to read while under guard in libraries at the University of Texas and at Princeton.

One of the stories—titled The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls—is a precursor to the Salinger classic The Catcher in the Rye.

Also leaked were Birthday Boy, about a
 young man in rehab for alcoholism, and Paula, which recounts the tale 
of a woman whose pregnancy drives her to insanity then ruins her 
marriage.

As per Salinger’s will, the stories weren’t to be published until 2051.

None
 of them have ever been published, but The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls 
was written for publication in  Harper’s Bazaar before the author 
withdrew it.

The story details the death of Kenneth Caulfield, the character Salinger would later turn into Holden Caulfield’s brother Allie.

Princeton’s was once the only manuscript of The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls available to be read.

The reclusive author specified in his will that the stories not be published until 2060. One of the stories The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls, details lives of characters who are also in his classic The Catcher in the Rye

Plot thickens: Though the stories were never published, the eBay auction where the PDF version available online reportedly originates sold a hardcover book that appears to have been printed for publication. It has an ISBN number that does not work

Buzzfeed spoke to a gentleman named PJ Vogt who’s read both the Princeton copy and the online version.

He verified the story’s authenticity.

‘I
 definitely remember that first line,’ Vogt said. ‘”His shoes turned 
up.” And I remember the detail about the India ink on the catcher’s 
mitt. And that Holden has a cameo from camp.’

But Vogt's revelation also further deepened the mystery.

'My
 memory is that Princeton’s copy looked like a submission — typed out 
pages, maybe even double-spaced. These seem too laid out to be from that
 collection,' he said.

The author of J.D. Salinger: A Life confirmed the authenticity of all three manuscripts.

‘While
 I do quibble with the ethics (or lack of ethics) in posting the 
Salinger stories,’ Kenneth Slawenski told Buzzfeed, ‘they look to be 
true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies.’

The PDF first sprung up on the invite-only bit torrent site what.CD.

The source was allegedly an eBay auction of a book, complete with cover, titled Three Stories.

A
 Reddit contributor then told the whole world about the find and the 
rest will go down into the history annals of Salinger’s mysterious life.
