A 21-month-old boy was taken to hospital after he tried to eat potentially fatal diabetes pills that had been pushed through the wrong letterbox by a local pharmacy.

Zubayr Naeem, of Blackburn, Lancashire, was attracted to the chocolate-coloured medication he found near the front door, and put two tablets in his mouth.

The boy was about to swallow them when his 37-year-old father Mohammed Naeem arrived home and fished them out of his mouth after realising what he had done.

Zubayr took Trajenta pills, which improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. They were addressed to a neighbour, but had been delivered in error by a local pharmacy.

Riaz Pharmacy said medication should not be posted through a letterbox, and said a driver had been suspended. The boy’s father, a CCTV installer, is now taking legal advice.

The pills lower blood sugar over time and, in a child under two, would have caused a coma and probable death if swallowed and no antidote or sugar was administered swiftly, doctors said.

Mr Naeem returned home to find Zubayr pushing two tablets into his mouth in the hallway. His wife Yasmin, cooking in the kitchen, was unaware the drugs had been posted through the letterbox.

Mr Naeem rang the NHS 111 line and was told to take his son to A&E at Royal Blackburn Hospital. Zubayr was kept in overnight.

Three days later, father-of-four Mr Naeem took his son to his GP for a check-up after he carried on crying and seemed distressed.

He said: ‘I was really scared. He could have died. This should never have happened. They should never have just pushed such dangerous drugs through a letterbox instead of handing them to someone.

‘These pills looked just like chocolates and my son was far too young to know not to eat them.’

Pharmacy manager Riaz Hinglotowala said: ‘This issue is currently under investigation to find out exactly what happened. These drugs should not have been pushed through a letterbox.

‘Our policy is to give them to an individual and if no-one is present leave a note asking them to ring us to arrange delivery. The driver has been suspended.’

Trajenta, also known as Linagliptin, is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes is a condition that affects almost 3million people in Britain, causing their blood sugar level to get too high.

Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body producing insufficient insulin to properly function - or cells not reacting to insulin.

Trajenta can reduce blood sugar levels, but can cause cough or cold-like side effects. Persistent abdominal pain is also possible.

The drug also reduces how much glucagon - which makes your liver produce more sugar - is produced by your pancreas.

Mr Naeem said: ‘I had been in London to meet a friend and rang my wife on my way home to ask her to make me a curry.

‘She was in the kitchen cooking my dinner and keeping an eye on Zubayr who was in the hall playing safely with his toys.

‘I came home and saw him chewing two chocolate-coloured pills. I grabbed them and got them out of his mouth and then saw the packet. I was really frightened and my wife was just crying.

‘At once I rang 111 and they told me to get him to the emergency department of the hospital immediately and offered to send an ambulance.

‘They took him immediately and then kept 
till 7am the following morning. They were clearly very worried. He kept 
on crying and I took him to our GP three days later who gave him the all
 clear.

‘We are very lucky. He could have died if we had not seen him do it, got the pills out and taken him to hospital where they were fantastic.  If everyone hadn’t acted quickly, it would have had serious consequences.

‘I have CCTV of the man delivering the pills. I am taking legal advice. I want something done so this cannot happen again and my neighbour is not left without his life-saving pills.’

A General Pharmaceutical Council spokesman said: ‘All pharmacies are required to meet our standards for registered pharmacies, which include supplying medicines and medical devices safely.

‘The GPhC sets out the standards of conduct, ethics and performance that pharmacy professionals must follow. A pharmacy professional’s conduct will be judged against these standards and failure to comply could put their registration at risk.’
