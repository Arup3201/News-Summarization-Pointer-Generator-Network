A female jogger who died after being attacked by eight dogs - including six pit bulls - in Los Angeles has been identified today.

Pamela Devitt, 62, died from her wounds on the way to hospital.

Authorities are warning the people of Littlerock, about 40 miles (65km) northeast of the city of Los Angeles, to be wary following the horrendous attack which took place at 9.30am on Thursday.

Attacked: Pamela Devitt was killed by the pack of dogs while jogging near her home in Littlerock

Impounded: Eight dogs in total have been impounded from a nearby home. A man was also arrested at the property

They have now impounded six pit bulls and two mixed breed dogs believed to have carried out the attack.

Tony Bell, spokesman for Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, told NBC4 that the pit bulls are a dangerous breed.

'These pit bulls are a killing machines. They're different than other animals. They need to have enhanced enforcement on these particular animals,' he said.

The incident comes days after Brandy Bookamer, a 27-year-old Florida mother was found critically injured after being mauled by a pack of dogs Sunday night, while shielding her young daughter from attack.

Sheriff's Lt. John Corina told reporters that a woman in a car saw the dogs attacking Ms Devitt.

The witness called 911 and honked her horn to try to get the dogs to stop.

'When the first deputy on scene saw one dog still attacking the woman, he tried to chase the dog away,' Corina said.

'The dog ran off into the desert, then turned around and attacked the deputy, the deputy fired a round at the dog and tried to kill the dog, and the dog took off into the desert.'

The woman died while she was in an ambulance on the way to a hospital near the high desert community of Littlerock said Evelina Villa, county animal control spokeswoman.Â 

Sheriff's
officials used a helicopter to search for the dogs.

Later they served a search warrant
on a home near the site of the attack and took away eight dogs.

A 29-year-old man from the house was also arrested on suspicion of cultivating marijuana.

Vicious: The dogs are suspected of carrying out the violent attack

Horrifying: Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control and Sheriff personnel congregate near the area where a 63-year-old female jogger was attacked and killed by four pit bulls in Palmdale, California

Terrifying: The attack comes days after Brandy Bookamer, a 27-year-old Florida mother was found critically injured after being mauled by a pack of dogs Sunday night, while shielding her young daughter from attack

'In these areas, you might have a situation where people dump animals out in rural areas,' said John Mlynar, a spokesman for the nearby city of Palmdale.

He added that he'd never heard of an attack like Thursday's.

Residents who live near the site of the attack said stray dogs are constantly roaming the area and have attacked people before.

'It's really scary,' Diane Huffman, of Littlerock, told KABC-TV. 'I don't know what to think. I really think I'm going to be getting a gun to protect myself.'
