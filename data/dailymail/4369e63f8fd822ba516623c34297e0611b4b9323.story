A woman with an ‘unhealthy attraction’ to Prince Harry was arrested outside an exclusive charity polo match where he was playing.

Canadian Wen Qi, 26, was twice caught trying to gain entry to Greenwich Polo Club on Wednesday – the last day of Prince Harry’s successful US tour.

Qi, from Toronto, is on an ‘international watch-list’ of people protection officers keep an eye out for at his public events.

Local police spotted her near the polo grounds in Connecticut where the prince was playing in aid of his charity, Sentebale.

Despite being told that the event was invitation only, officers later found her walking round the perimeter of the club.

Qi was taken into custody and has now
been charged with third-degree criminal trespass. She was offered bail 
but was unable to raise money for the $1,000 bond.

Police spokesman Kraig Gray said: 
‘Prince Harry is a high-prominence figure. There are some people who 
have got an unhealthy attraction to him.’

A spokesman for Prince Harry conceded
that they were aware of the incident but said: ‘We cannot comment on 
any matter of security.’

However, he described her as 'a person who wanted to see Prince Harry. Prince Harry is a high prominence figure. There are some people who have an unhealthy attraction to him'.

He added that 'international law enforcement agencies' issued advisories 'to be watchful for her'.

Inside the event Prince Harry rounded up a successful overseas tour - with his team even winning 4-3.

The exclusive event was attended by dignitaries and celebrities including supermodel Stephanie Seymour and fashion designer Jason Wu.

To the envy of his female fans Harry  exchanged a kiss with model Karolina Kurkova who presented with his trophy.

Harry was raising money for his children's charity Sentebale by taking part in the event and security was especially tight for those attending.

Qi will appear at the state Superior Court in Stamford on May 22.
