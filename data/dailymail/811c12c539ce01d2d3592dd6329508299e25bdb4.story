She was three weeks away from her due date when the chest pains started.

And when Sara Palmer stood up and was sick she and husband Joe knew something was seriously wrong.

Paramedics rushed the 31-year-old from Ruthin, Wales, to hospital with suspected internal bleeding and dangerously low blood pressure. Once there doctors struggled to find her baby's heart beat.

An emergency caesarean followed and premature Isabella, weighing just 5lb 10oz.,  was put in the special care baby unit. But Mrs Palmer continued to haemorrhage blood.

Eventually doctors found a tumour on Mrs Palmer's liver and 19 medics spent the next eight hours trying to save her life pumping a massive 56 units (around 46 pints) of blood into her to keep her alive.

Journey: Baby Isabella was delivered three weeks early by emergency caesarean section after her mother Sara Palmer started haemorrhaging blood

Struggle: Doctors found a tumour on Mrs Palmer's liver and battled for eight hours and used 56 units (around 46 pints) of blood trying to save her life

One of the specialists later admitted he hoped that night to save at least mother or baby.

But both made it through in the end. Now the couple are speaking out about their ordeal and have set up a charity urging people to give blood.

For Mrs Palmer, who had been transferred from Wales to a Liverpool hospital, the day's events remain hazy.

The school transport officer said: 'I remember opening my eyes and Joe 
was sitting by me. He told me we had a little girl, that she was OK and 
that we were in Liverpool.

'The baby was in Bodelwyddan (Wales) and I could not get my head around what had happened.'

Communications: With Mrs Palmer still tired and weak, and affected by the anaesthetics, she was in and out of consciousness so the couple began writing notes to each other

With Mrs Palmer still tired and weak, and affected by the anaesthetics, she was in and out of consciousness.

The couple began communicating by writing little notes.

'I scribbled down some questions and 
Joe gave me the answers,' Mrs Palmer said. 'I have kept those notes. I can’t believe some 
of the questions I asked. I even asked how Wilsy the cat was!'

For Mr Palmer the ordeal has been an emotional rollercoaster.

'I could see they were struggling to 
find the baby’s heart beat,' said the 30-year-old builder. 'I didn’t want Sara to know, so just kept 
saying that everything was fine. Then suddenly the anaesthetist came in 
and said "we're taking her to theatre, go, go, go".

All's well: Mrs Palmer, her husband Joe and baby Bella are all back at home in Wales taking each day as it comes

When a nurse later came in and asked if he wanted to meet his daughter he had mixed feelings.

'Obviously I was overjoyed that my 
daughter was alive, but I felt like I’d cheated Sara meeting her first. I
still didn’t know what was going on with Sara,' he said.

'I just sat there staring at my daughter with a drip in her hand and a pipe coming out of her mouth breathing for her.

'The next seven hours were the worst of my life.

'My brain was in overdrive, running 
through everything that had happened - could I have reacted quicker? 
Would I cope as a single parent? Would my daughter recover but have 
brain damage?

'My mind was a cruel enemy that night.'

Three days later Mrs Palmer was transferred back to Glan Clwyd Hospital and got to meet her daughter for the first time.

Not quite out of the woods: Mrs Palmer unfortunately needs further surgery to remove a benign tumour from her liver

'I took Isabella in my arms and 
walked her in to meet her Mummy for the first time - the most 
breathtaking and wonderful moment of my life,' Mr Palmer said.

'Sara’s reaction was beautiful. They bonded instantly together and then sat peacefully together as a family for the first time.'

Initially the family's charity Blood4Bella started as a Facebook page so people could donate and replenish the blood stocks used to save Mrs Palmer and Bella.

But more than 150 registered immediately 
to give a pint of blood leaving Mr and Mrs Palmer overwhelmed by the response.

Now the charity has been launched 
nationwide.

Mr Palmer said: 'We hope our website and story 
inspires people to give someone else the opportunity to live. Without 
blood donors and the amazing NHS staff we would not have a family.'

Barbara Blanche, of NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'The amount of blood Sara received is more than we collect for example at a whole session in some areas.

'This story drives home just how 
important our blood donors are, they really do save and improve lives - 
Sara and Isabella are living proof.'

Mrs Palmer is now back home at the family home and Isabella is doing well. Unfortunately she needs further surgery to remove a benign tumour from her 
liver.

She said: 'It’s just good to be home as a family.'
