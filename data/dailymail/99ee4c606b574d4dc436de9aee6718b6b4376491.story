A Merseyside schoolboy died after being swept from rocks into the sea while on a family holiday in Wales despite a valiant attempt by his older brother to save his life.

Fifteen-year-old Sam Capper was on holiday when he was washed away when a freak wave crashed against the slippery rocks where he was fishing.

The sporty teenager, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, drowned despite the valiant attempts of his older brother Lewis Hunt, 21, who battled dangerous rip currents to try and keep his sibling afloat.

At one point the University student managed to grab his brother's hands but they were ripped apart by the outgoing tide and strong offshore winds.

Lewis was in a serious condition yesterday at Morriston Hospital in Swansea with his father Phil, 42, and mother Leah, 41, keeping a vigil at his bedside.

Leah said: 'Our only consolation in 
this terrible tragedy is that, at the end, Sam wasn’t on his own - Lewis
was with him, holding on to him tightly.

'Sam,
who most people knew as Spud, was a unique, amazing, boy who touched 
the lives of so many people with his generosity, kindness and infectious
laugh.

Sam had been camping with his father Phil on  family holiday when tragedy struck and he was swept away

'He loved 
his brothers and sisters and spent most of his time - when he wasn’t 
thinking about football - trying to help people and make people smile.

'He
was a huge fan of Tranmere Rovers, though he also liked Arsenal - which
caused a bit of good-natured rivalry with Lewis who supports Liverpool.

'Sam has left a gap in our lives and will be missed, not just by his family, but by everyone who knew him.'

Phil was taking his sons for their yearly camping trip at Llangennith on the Gower coast near Swansea.

The family had travelled from their home in Birkenhead, Merseyside, to visit the seaside campsite when the tragedy struck.

Sam's brother Lewis, who is now in hospital, tried to save the sporty teen, but lost him to the strong current

At around 8pm the pair, who are understood to have been camping nearby with their parents, were on 
slippery rocks in an area known as Bluepool Corner, when suddenly a 
'huge wave' took the 15-year-old with it into the sea.

Lewis dived in to find him and 
managed to hold his hand as they were tossed around by the water, but a 
strong tide and winds separated them and took them around half a mile 
out to sea.

Geraint Parry, principal of Sam's school the University Academy in Birkenhead, paid tribute.

He said: 'Sam was an outgoing and popular young man who enjoyed life to the full.

'His gentle humour and easy banter won him many friends and his teachers described him as a 'model student'.

Sam was affectionately known as 'Spud', a model student and a keen sports player

'He was also an able sportsman, loved
playing football and hockey, and having just completed Year 10 he was 
due to begin his final year where he looked set to achieve success.

'Sam's death has shocked our close 
community and we will be doing all that we can to support his friends 
and family, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this sad 
time.'

Steve Jones was leading the rescue from the shore for the coastguard and told MailOnline what happened.

'They were fishing on the water's edge when the youngest boy
was swept into the sea by a huge wave,' he said

'His brother then jumped in himself to save him.

'The tide was going out and there was also an offshore wind
that dragged them out to sea and they ended up around half a mile out.

'I know they were together for a while. The brothers were
holding hands hands at one point in the water but couldn't keep together and
were separated.

'Sadly the youngest boy died. His brother swallowed water
and had hyperthermia but he will be okay, although he will be very distressed.'

Stunned friends last night began to pay tribute to the popular teenager on Facebook and Twitter.

One of Sam’s closest friends, David Moore, said: 'Sam Capper was one of my true mates.

'He was so funny and amazing. 

'You will be missed, sleep tight.'

Family friend Billy Newman wrote: 'RIP, Sam Capper.

'You will be missed very much. My heart goes out to you and your family.

'RIP little man.'

And Wirral teenager Elisha Price added: 'RIP, Sam, I hope your brother pulls through in hospital.

'Keep looking down on him giving him the strength to pull through.'

Two other boys were with the brothers when the tragic accident happened.

'The two
others there thought about doing the same thing as his brother but did the right thing and ran
for help,' Mr Jones said.

'Unfortunately because they were in the middle of nowhere it
took 10 minutes for them to find a young couple with a mobile phone who then
rang 999.

'Within 34 minutes we had them both out of the water.

'We are all very sad that this poor boy has died but at
least one life was saved.'

Bluepool Corner is a secluded beauty 
spot that can only be reached by foot. The actual cause of death has not
yet been confirmed, police said.

'We
responded to reports of two males in the sea at Llangennith, Swansea, 
at around 8.20pm on Wednesday August 1,' a South Wales Police spokesman 
said.

Rescue: The boy was plucked from the water by a RAF helicopter like this one but sadly died later

'They were taken by helicopter to Morriston hospital where one of the males, aged 15, was pronounced dead.

'The other male, aged 21, remains in hospital.'

Swansea Coastguard said it had called out the Rhossili Coastguard rescue team, the Loughor independent rescue boat, Burry Port RNLI inshore lifeboat and the Tenby RNLI all-weather lifeboat and a rescue helicopter.

One brother was picked up by Burry Port lifeboat and the other was winched from the water by the helicopter.

Will Parfitt, Watch Manager, Swansea Coastguard said: 'The Coastguard recommends that anglers who are fishing on their own close to the water’s edge and from an unstable platform (such as rocks) should wear a lifejacket or buoyancy aid.

'If you are undertaking activities at the coast, it is advisable to have a means of communication in case of emergency.'
