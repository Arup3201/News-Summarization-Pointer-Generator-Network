The Omaha Police Officers Association in Nebraska has come under extreme criticism after it posted a video of an African American toddler uttering profanities to use as an example of ‘the thug cycle’.

The diapered child is seen in a phone camera video taken by two purported relatives who are swearing at each other and the child and teaching him to swear back.

'... despite the fact that it is sickening, heartbreaking footage, we have an obligation to share it to continue to educate the law abiding public about the terrible cycle of violence and thuggery that some young innocent children find themselves helplessly trapped in,’ said the post on their website.

'Thug cycle': A video of a toddler was posted by the Omaha police union as an example of city violence, which has angered some people who say nothing illegal is happening in the video

Facebook comments: People react to the video post from the self-proclaimed uncle of the toddler

Union President John Wells defended their decision to post the video saying 'a lot of these children end up dealing with law enforcement'

The website states: ‘Now while we 
didn't see anything in this video that is blatantly 'illegal', we sure 
did see a lot that is flat out immoral and completely unhealthy for this
 little child from a healthy upbringing standpoint.’

The
 post tells the public that they are ‘literally watching “the cycle” of 
violence continue right in front of your eyes. A powerful cycle that 
must be broken if we ever hope to get a handle on violence in Omaha. A 
powerful cycle that the police alone cannot stop.’

The
 so-called ‘thug’ who posted the video of the toddler has lashed back in
 a comment on the police association’s Facebook page, which has not done
 him any favours as it's laced with f-word bombs.

Union President John Wells, who is a sergeant in the Omaha Police Department, told Gawker that they use the term ‘thug’ as a ‘general term on our Facebook page’, but that it could be substituted by a variety of other terms including ‘abnormal, antisocial, criminal’.

However, many people have taken to social media to criticize the move.

One user, Joshua David, said on the union's Facebook page: 'As a union employee and member, I'm ashamed that this post exists. Not because of the video, but because of the racism. But hey, at least he'll learn early that he's nothing but an n-word to society.'

Defending their action of posting the
 video of the toddler and likening it to violence, Wells said that 'a lot of 
these children end up dealing with law enforcement'.

WARNING: Video contains graphic content

Taught bad things: The child is seen sticking up his middle finger, right, and in the left photo is covering his face as his relatives call him various profanities

‘[But] I'm not saying that this kid won't grow up to be a productive member of society.’The
 post called the video's creator, who is reportedly the toddler's uncle,
 a ‘local thug’, but Wells said: ‘I don't know that he's a gangbanger...
 he mentions 29th Street, which is a local Bloods gang here’.

He
 told Gawker.com that his association is different to the police 
department, which is why they have ‘a lot more latitude to be a little 
more edgy’ and that edginess is necessary to force a deeper conversation
 on the city's crime problems.

Omaha
 is largely ethnically segregated, he says, and many residents dismiss 
crime by saying ‘it didn't happen in my part of town, that's not a 
problem’, he said.
