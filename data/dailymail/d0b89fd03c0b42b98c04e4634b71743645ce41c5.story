Anyone who has shelled out for an expensive phone lives in fear of dropping it.

Now the world's 'most resilient screen protector' has gone on sale, capable of surviving being hit by a hammer.

During tests, the transparent screen, which is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, also remained undamaged when dropped while walking on tarmac, bricks and concrete, its manufacturer claims.

Called Rhino Shield, the protector is made from a custom-formulated polymer and can absorb five times the impact energy of Gorilla Glass - the glass currently used on iPhone and Samsung screens, for example.

The Rhino Shield screen protector, pictured here on the iPhone 5, costs £17.99 and can absorb up to five times the force of Gorilla Glass, currently used on iPhones and other phones. During tests it was also able to withstand being dropped on bricks and tarmac

Even a 255g steel ball dropping from 48cm failed to scratch the screen and left the phone 'fully usable.'

Made by Cambridge-based Evolutive Labs, the sheet can be fitted to the iPhone 5, 5S and 5C and does not affect the touchscreen's sensitivity.

The screen comes with a self-adhesive silicone back and as the user wipes a cloth along the front of the film, it clings to the phone's screen, but can be removed if necessary.

Its makers claim the Rhino Shield leaves 'no sticky residue or air bubbles' and uses what's called an oleophobic coating that makes it 'smudge proof'; meaning fingerprints don't stick to it.

An iPhone 4 version of the scratch resistant screen will be available soon, with other models expected in the future.

Rhino Shield was funded by a Kickstarter campaign that ended in March this year and it is now on sale from Firebox for £17.99.

The makers explained on the campaign page: 'Protecting mobile devices have been a big challenge.

The Rhino Shield sheet, pictured, is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, around 0.029cm, and has a 95 per cent transparency rating. Its makers Evolutive Labs claim that it doesn't affect the phone's touchscreen

The Rhino Shield also comes with an oleophobic coating making it resistant to smudges and fingerprints

'There are many great cases that already tackle some of the problems with outstanding solutions and we have seen some protection at insane levels, i.e. cases that enable smart devices to survive when a car runs over it.

'However, there are very few products that attempt to protect the most vulnerable part of the phone - its screen.

'Therefore we were determined to design and engineer a screen protector that will be resistant to impacts. After a year of relentless research and development, the end product is Rhino Shield.'

The phone protector goes on sale as SquareTrade, a provider of protection plans for gadgets, tested five smartphones, including Apple's new iPhones, to see if they could withstand drops, dunks and other common hazards.

Its found that while the iPhone 5C and 5S scored similar on the 'Breakability' scale, the latest models aren't as durable as last year's iPhone 5.

The biggest loser, however, was Samsung's Galaxy S4, which failed to work after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground, according to San Francisco-based SquareTrade.

The phone that withstood SquareTrade's torture test best was Google's Moto X.

New research by SquareTrade reveals that the iPhone 5s & 5c were outshone by their predecessor, the iPhone 5, and the Samsung Galaxy S4.
