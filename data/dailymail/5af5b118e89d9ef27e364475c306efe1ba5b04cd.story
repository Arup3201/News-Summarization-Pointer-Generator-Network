Liverpool defender Glen Johnson is likely to be out for about a month after picking up a groin injury against Manchester United on Sunday.

Javier Manquillo could be set for an extended run if manager Brendan Rodgers reverts to a flat back four having experimented with three centre-backs against United.

Johnson will now miss the Capital One Cup quarter-final against Bournemouth, along with Mario Balotelli.

Javier Manquillo could be set for an extended outing in the Liverpool team under Brendan Rodgers

The Italy international was a second-half substitute in the defeat at Old Trafford, where he made his comeback after more than a month on the sidelines with a groin problem.

But he has stayed behind to receive further treatment on the injury at the club's Melwood training ground with a view to him being fit for Sunday's visit of Arsenal.

Johnson and Balotelli join the likes of Daniel Sturridge on the injury list.
