Women will place their faith in all manner of weird and wonderful beauty buys in their quest for eternal youth.

The last product that promised to dramatically slow the effects of ageing without resorting to surgery was the wrinkle-busting balaclava.

The Face Trainer maintained that just ten minutes of daily wear would be enough to tighten sagging skin and ease 
the signs of ageing.

And hot on its heels comes the Facewaver Exercise Mask, a spin-off version created by a Japanese company that comes with a set of, frankly, terrifying advertising campaign shots.

Frightening tightening: The Facewaver Exercise Mask from Japan promises to give users a more youthful and energetic look

The mask is described online as 'a new face stretcher from Japan that promises to give users a more youthful and energetic look'.

'It's cheaper and doubles as a great Halloween outfit,' states Japan Trend Shop, who sell the product.

The stretchy accessory wraps around your face and claims to help exercise different muscles while you make all kinds of bizarre facial expressions.

Apparently, this not only improves and increases blood circulation to your face, but also smooths out any wrinkles, lines and sags in just five minutes of daily use.

Available only in pink, the Facewaver is made out of nylon and polyurethane and will fit most face sizes.

Priced at £40.58 ($61), this bizarre invention markets itself as a more affordable way to tighten your face and cheeks.

There are, however, no reports on whether it actually works.

It all started with this: The Face Trainer works to reduce the signs of aging by toning the underlying muscles through a series of exercises

Strange: The device comes with detailed instructions of the exercises, which, if 
done for 10 minutes a day, are meant to help build up the muscles under 
the face and improve wrinkles

Among the amusing range developed in 
Japan is the Hana Tsun nose straightener - billed as a 'nasal support 
beauty clip' - which features two silicone prongs that must be inserted into the 
nostrils.

According to the 
seller, also Japan Trend Shop, putting the gadget into one's nose for 20 
minutes a day is enough to achieve the perfect profile.

Other unusual products sold on the 
website include the £80 Eye Slack Haruka, which is aimed at combating 
sagging skin around the eyes with battery-powered vibrating pads, and 
the £70 Beauty Lift High Nose, which applies vibrations to help push the
 nose higher and make it firmer. 

The
 manufacturers insist that just three minutes' use a day will make 
enough of a difference that others will notice the user's perky new 
profile.

Quirky: The Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece is made of a pliable silicone that is said to be comfortable to wear

For those who hanker after the 
plumped-up lips of Katie Price - or even more extreme, Pete 
Burns - the rather cartoonish Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece slips over
 the wearer's own mouth, with the ultimate goal of boosting the lips to a
 more prominent pout.

And then there's the Facial Lift At Once Toner, a 
cylindrical white plastic gadget that is gripped between the user's lips where it 
buzzes at a high frequency, thereby toning the area.

Lip up: A facial lifting device fits between the lips where it buzzes at a high frequency to exercise the area, resulting, say the manufacturers, in a youthful, taut complexion

'All
 you do is put on the mouth cover, pop it in your mouth and it does the 
hard work for you!,' the website claims, adding: 'If only running a 
marathon could be as easy!'

The Japan Trend Shop claims the results are instantaneous.

Other gadgets include rubber masks that 
can be strapped on to provide resistance for facial exercises (just 10 
minutes a day will provide staggering results, they say) and a pair of 
outlandish goggles that the makers claim will mean you 'won't look old 
and tired any more' thanks to their ridged form that massages tired, 
lined eyes.
