The elder brother of South African Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius has been admitted to intensive care after he was involved in a car crash.

Carl was returning home from a business trip when he collided head-on with another vehicle on a motorway outside the town of Modimolle, 80 miles north of Pretoria. 

He was admitted to intensive care, but hospital officials say he is out of danger.

Collision: Carl Pistorius, Oscar's elder brother is in intensive care following a head-on collision in 

Carl is said to have broken his right forearm, leg and left foot. He has also injured his hip and suffered cuts to his liver and heart. 

Arnold Pistorius, the family's spokesperson, said: 'Carl is badly hurt but out of danger. His vehicle was hit head-on by another car that had suddenly, and without warning, swerved.'

A statement issued by the family read: 'Carl was returning from a business trip to Polokwane. A colleague was following in a separate vehicle and witnessed the collision. He was able to tell us what happened.'

It said the collision took place on the N1, South Africa's main motorway, when a driver from the opposite side of the highway swerved into oncoming traffic.

The car hit Pistorius’s vehicle -- which was travelling in the opposite direction -- head-on as it veered into his lane.

Last year he was cleared over the death of a female motorcyclist who crashed into his car during a bike rally in 2008. 

Oscar, 27, is approaching the end of his trial for shooting dead Reeva Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door at his home following a late-night argument. He maintains that he thought she was an intruder, and killed her accidentally.

Closing arguments in the trial are due to be heard next week.
