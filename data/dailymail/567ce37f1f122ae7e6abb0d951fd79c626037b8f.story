Maradona who played for the Stadio San Paolo outfit between 1984 to 1992, was in the Neopolitan area as the city hosted the third leg of the UIM Skydive XCat World Series for the first time in their history.

The 53-year-old, who scored 81 goals in 188 appearances for the club, wowed spectators with some old skills, before the event began.

The 1986 World Cup winner's arrival was highly anticipated ahead of the third leg. 'We are honoured that Diego Maradona will be joining us for what promises to be a thrilling race in Naples this weekend,' said Dr Khalid Al Zahed, vice-president of the World Professional Powerboating Association.

'As a hero of the local football side back in the 1980s, we have no doubt that his presence will add to the excitement that is already building around the third race of the series,' he added.

Maradona joined Napoli for a world record fee of Â£6.9 million from Barcelona before a brief spell at Sevilla.
