SPOILER ALERT: Months after being canceled by ABC, All My Children and One Life to Live return today in the first ever online revival of soap operas.

The Online Network bring many original characters and story lines back to Pine Valley and Llanview, but the shows have the edgier feel of a nighttime soap, according to Entertainment Weekly. 

The premiere of All My Children jumps five years ahead from the cliffhanger finale in 2011 where a shot was fired in a room 
full of people - then cuts to a 
hot dream sequence between David (Vincent Irizarry) and Cara (Lindsay 
Hartley) that would have definitely raised a few daytime broadcast 
censor's eyebrows.

Daytime drama: One Life to Live returns today with an all-new online version that will feature many members of the original cast plus some new faces

Story update: The new online episodes of All My Children will be 30 minutes rather than the usual 60, and can be watched on Hulu, Hulu Plus and iTunes

All My Children is the more traditional of the two shows, and even with no Erica Kane there are a lot of familiar faces. Evil David (Vincent Irizarry) is out of prison and still up to no good. Angie and Jesse (Debbi Morgan and Darnell Williams) are still madly in love - but disturbing details emerge involving their daughter Cassandra.

Opal (Jill Larson) asks son Petey (Robert Scott Wilson) to bring his Silicon Valley experience - and washboard abs - to help reverse the fortunes of the family business. Adam (David Canary) asks Brooke (Julia Barr) to marry him. . .but does he have an ulterior motive? 

Funny moments: David steals the show when he shows up at the club for a disco dance sequence

Over in Llanview, One Life to Live also brought back a lot of fan favorites including Vicki 
Lord (Erika Slezak), Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser) Bo 
(Robert S. Woods), Nora (Hillary B. 
Smith), and Blair (Kassie DePaiva).

New characters include a bartender played by Jersey Shore star Jenny 'JWoww' Farley. Snoop Lion, who wrote the new theme song, is also slated to appear. 

The premiere had a darker feel with plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments - there was a murder before the 
opening credits and a hooded figure with a mysterious tattoo stalking
bad boy Todd.

Tea (Florencia Lozano) is still mourning
her her baby who died in Port Charles, but ignoring her teenage 
daughter Dani whose out-of-control  partying leads to tragic consequences in one 
of the most shocking scenes.

But there were also humorous moments: David (Tuc Watkins) stole the show when he performed a Saturday Night Fever-style disco dream sequence outside the club.

Having everyone in town 
show congregate at the same spot has become as common a plot device as coming back from the dead, but this time it actually felt realistic.

New twist: One Life To Live mixes younger characters like Jeffrey (far left) and Matthew (near left)  with older generations of veterans like Viki (near right) and Todd (far right)

The younger characters want 
to party, while the older ones have a financial stake in the club. And 
the generational differences are mentioned - one guy even calls Blair (Kassie DePaiva) a 'cougar'.

The new episodes, which are 30 minutes rather than the usual 60, will available 
to watch on Hulu, Hulu Plus and iTunes. New episodes run online Mondays 
through Thursdays, with a recap show onFridays.
