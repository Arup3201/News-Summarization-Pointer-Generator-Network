Northern Territory  Minister Dave Tollner resigned as Deputy Chief the day after he made homophobic slurs against the son of one of his colleagues.

The Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refused to attend all meetings after Mr Tollner called his son Joshua Higgins – a staffer of Minister Bess Price – a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter' after a draft speech about the issues of gay marriage was presented to cabinet ministers on Thursday, according to the ABC.

Despite Chief Minister Adam Giles telling media that the matter had been resolved with an apology, NT News reported that Joshua remained angered by Mr Tollner’s comments.

However a statement released by Joshua’s father also claims that the matter had been resolved.

NT Minister Dave Tollner has resigned as Deputy Chief and moved to the backbench after calling the son of a Country Liberal Party colleague a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter'

'My son and I accepted an apology from Mr Tollner for his comments that he did not intend to cause harm or offence,' Mr Higgins wrote.

'I now understand that I may have misinterpreted some comments by Deputy Chief Minister David Tollner and acknowledge he has apologised to my son. Dave Tollner and my son are friends and colleagues.'

He ended the statement by writing: 'Deputy Chief Minister Tollner is a competent part of the Northern Territory Government, and has my support.'

Mr Tollner, who has been moved to the backbench, confirmed that he has no intention to stand down and maintains the comments were made during a 'personal conversation'.

In an interview on Mix1049, Mr Tollner claimed he has 'no issue with gay people at all' and revealed that his mother has been in a long-term relationship with another woman since he was a child, the ABC reported.

Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, has since announced he has accepted Mr Tollner's apology after originally threatening to boycott all Country Liberal Party meetings

Mr Tollner's gay nephew Dale Kelly, also approached the ABC to say that his uncle does not discriminated against gay people and supports his relationship.

'Never in my time knowing David has he offended me or discriminated against same-sex relationships.'

'He knows myself and my partner and his mother is in a same-sex relationship, so it's something he's been exposed to and never had an issue with.'

During his brief interview at the Darwin radio station, Mr Tollner also revealed he would not be making a public apology.

'I can't see what I am to publicly apologise for. I've been called 10,000 things worse than this, but you accept them in the good humour in which they're delivered,' he said.

Despite ongoing pressure from opposition members such as Labor Leader Delia Lawrie, who have demanded Mr Tollner be sacked, Mr Giles called Mr Tollner a ‘valued staff member’ and clarified that they would just move on from the incident.
