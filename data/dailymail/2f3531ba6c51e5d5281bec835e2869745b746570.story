Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling agreed Wednesday to sign 
off on selling the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for what 
would be a record $2 billion, according to his attorney.

Sterling 'has made an agreement with the NBA to resolve all their 
differences' and as co-owner has given his consent to a deal that was 
negotiated by his wife, Shelly Sterling, to sell the team, said attorney
 Maxwell Blecher.

Representatives for Shelly Sterling declined to comment.

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will become the new owner of the Clippers once the deal is signed

The NBA declined to comment on Wednesday afternoon.

Donald Sterling sued the NBA in federal court last week alleging the 
NBA violated his constitutional rights by relying on information from an 'illegal' recording that publicized racist remarks he made to a 
girlfriend.

It also says the league committed a breach of contract by 
fining Sterling $2.5 million and that it violated antitrust laws by 
trying to force a sale.

Blecher said the suit will be dismissed.

If the NBA owners approve 
the sale, it will be a record-high sum for a team that cost Donald 
Sterling about $12 million in 1981.

Blecher's co-counsel, Bobby Samini, 
said the vote by league owners is expected to take place in mid-July.

Ballmer beat out bids by Guggenheim Partners and a group including 
former NBA All-Star Grant Hill. Ballmer made more than an hour-long 
personal visit to Shelly Sterling's Malibu home last week and laid out 
his plan.

The record-setting sale was negotiated by Sterling's wife, Shelly Sterling

This is not Ballmer's first foray into potential NBA ownership.

Ballmer and investor Chris Hansen headed a group that agreed to a deal 
to buy the Kings from the Maloof family in January 2013 with the 
intention of moving the team to Seattle, where the SuperSonics played 
until 2008.

But Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson lobbied the NBA for time to put 
together a bid to keep the team in California, and though the 
Ballmer-Hansen group later increased its offer, owners voted to deny the
 bid for relocation and the Kings were sold to Vivek Ranadive.
