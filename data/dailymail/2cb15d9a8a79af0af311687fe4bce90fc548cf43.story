Lewis Hamilton won a controversial Italian Grand Prix that conspiracy theorists believe was rigged by Mercedes.

Triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart joined fans on social media in questioning whether Nico Rosberg deliberately drove off the track to let Hamilton through to win to atone for causing the pair’s crash at Spa a fortnight ago.

Stewart said: ‘I thought, “hello, what’s going on here?”’ He could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he didn’t.’

Rosberg and his Mercedes management both flatly dismissed the claims, and the majority of people in the paddock agreed it was extremely unlikely that Rosberg gave way deliberately.

The German driver was also quick to deny the claims. He said: 'I just messed up. What would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately? There is no possible reason.

‘If you’re ordered by the team to do it then you would do it, but there is no reason why the team would ask me to change position, or something like that.

‘The only thing in people’s minds could be Spa, but Spa was a mistake I’ve apologised for. It’s not like we are now starting to shuffle our cars.’

How the drama unfolded: Rosberg's odd mistake heading into turn one at Monza 

Hamilton’s first win since the British Grand Prix in July, takes him to within 22 points of championship-leader Rosberg, who was booed by British fans, angered by the events of Spa, on the podium after coming second. 

The two Mercedes drivers stayed apart in the ante-room prior to the presentations. Rosberg spoke to third-placed Felipe Massa in Italian, while Hamilton faced the wall. 

Jean Alesi, conducting the podium interviews, asked Hamilton if he and Rosberg are now friends. As he answered unconvincingly, the Briton put his arm around Rosberg, who looked uncomfortable as his rival did so.

But Hamilton, who had to come from behind after a technical problem at the start, agreed the race was not rigged, saying of the decisive moment in the race: ‘It was the best time to put pressure on him. I did it a couple of races ago and he doesn’t seem to like it, so I’ll try it a bit more.

‘We’ve got a long way to go, but one step at a time. The support I’ve had from the fans and family has been incredible. I’m going to take that energy and try and move forwards. I’m just going to take it as it comes.’
