Banned: Deputy head teacher Teresa McKenzie was cleared two-and-a-half years ago by a jury of having sex with a special school pupil but has now been banned from teaching for two years

A deputy head teacher cleared two-and-a-half years ago by a jury of having sex with a special school pupil has been banned from teaching.

A jury at Chester Crown Court took less than an hour to return a unanimous not guilty verdict in the case of 41-year-old mother of two, Teresa McKenzie, from Meifod, near Welshpool, Powys.

But in a newly announced decision Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education has banned her from teaching for at least two years.

The ban follows a finding by the Teaching Agency that, despite being previously cleared by the jury, she was guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct whilst employed at the school between December 2007 and July 2008'.

The findings of the Teaching Agency say that she sent more than 600 text messages to a troubled pupil at the Cheshire school, and wrote letters to him calling him her 'gorgeous pirate'.

Ms McKenzie can apply to teach again in two years and had the right to challenge the ban at the High Court.

The panel found that she engaged in inappropriate communications with 16-year old Pupil A , including sending 644 text messages between December 2007 and July 2008 and four emails.

It found that she failed to maintain professional boundaries with Pupil A, though the findings make it clear that she is not alleged to have had any kind of sexual relationship with the boy.

The panel said that Pupil A joined the school, which is a residential and educational establishment for pupils with special needs, as a boarder in October 2006, but was excluded in July 2007, before being controversially readmitted in November of that year, by which time he was 16.

It said that two letters Ms McKenzie gave the boy began 'To my gorgeous Pirate' and 'Sweet Pupil A', and that her communications with him contained phrases including 'my seafaring sweetie', 'I will love you forever and ever and ever' and 'I won’t be able to concentrate in the meeting thinking about your beautiful eyes, strawberries and cream hair, soft hands, gorgeous laugh, strong-shoulders, delicious lips'.

She also wrote 'How are you 
sweetie?', 'Imagine me giving you a big hug and kiss this morning. How 
I’d love to do that' and 'I love you darling'.

Recommending
a Prohibition Order, the panel said: 'Ms McKenzie was in a senior 
position and one of considerable trust in relation to this highly 
vulnerable adolescent, who became dependent on her.

Firm: Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education has banned Ms McKenzie from teaching for at least two years

'In her efforts to support him, she lost her objectivity and this impacted on her professional judgment. She mismanaged the situation and by her own admission was out of her depth.'

Giving the decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: 'Ms McKenzie failed to observe professional boundaries, and in failing to observe those boundaries she abused the position of trust that she held with a vulnerable pupil.

'Her behaviour also set a poor example to her colleagues and placed others in the school at risk.

'The language used by Ms McKenzie in her communications with Pupil A was inappropriate and the amount of these communications was excessive.

'I consider that it is in the public interest to support the recommendation of the panel that Ms McKenzie is prohibited from teaching.'

The decision means that Ms McKenzie is prohibited from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England.

She may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until 3 October 2014, and if she does so, she will have to persuade a panel that she is fit to return to the classroom.

She has a right of appeal to the High Court.
