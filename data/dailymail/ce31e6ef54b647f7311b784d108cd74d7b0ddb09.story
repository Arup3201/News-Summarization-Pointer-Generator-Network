All dolled up: Pop star Carmit Bachar was born with a cleft palate

With her striking red hair and model’s cheekbones, it is impossible to imagine that  pop star Carmit Bachar as anything other than beautiful. As a member of the international chart-topping band Pussycat Dolls, she won legions of fans and wowed audiences around the world.

But her face – and life – has  not always been so perfect. For Carmit was born with a cleft lip and palate, a common birth defect that leaves babies with the upper lip and the roof of the mouth  split apart.

It took a string of gruelling operations to correct, meaning that Carmit’s childhood was punctuated by annual surgery from the age of just six months until she was 16.

In between the difficult recovery periods, she found herself bullied for the way she looked. But her  pop career gave her the chance to show people that physical imperfections can be overcome.

Carmit took to telling audiences about her cleft lip and palate during performances while she stood on stage with bandmates including  X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger.

‘I’d say, “Hi, I’m Carmit. You may not know I was born with a birth defect but growing up I felt different and not pretty. I’m sure everyone has something that makes them feel different, and I invite you to embrace that because that’s what makes you special and unique.”

‘There’d be this huge cheer and  I’d get fan mail saying thank you because this person or their daughter had a cleft lip or palate.’

The 38-year-old adds: ‘People need to know that beauty isn’t just on the outside – it’s on the inside. It’s kind of crazy that I was in a pop group that revolved around image when for so long I had this defect that could have held me back.’

The condition is now rarely seen  in children in the UK because it is  corrected soon after birth, but it remains the most common facial birth defect.

One in every 700 babies in the UK is born with a cleft. The type and severity varies widely. Some are born with either a cleft lip or a  cleft palate, but around half of those affected have both.

It was Carmit’s love of performing that helped her become resilient.  By the age of ten, she was having lessons in dance, piano and drama, and she also took up rhythmic gymnastics. Eventually she was selected for the US national team.

But despite countless operations, her face remained marked throughout adolescence – and she was even told by one talent agent not to get her hopes up about a career on stage because of her appearance.

After a major operation at the age of eight, which took a piece of bone from her thigh to build the hard palate in the top of her mouth, Carmit had to have more surgery to correct the appearance of her scar.

‘I’d be so excited, thinking this operation would fix it, and then I would be disappointed as my lips still looked different,’ she recalls.

Carmit also developed an underbite, a common complication of  cleft lip and palate as jaw growth can be disturbed by the recurrent surgery. Her underbite worsened from the age of 12 until it reached the point where she didn’t recognise herself, and at 16 she underwent major surgery to correct that too.

The repeated operations meant that she had to learn how to use  her voice again.

‘I had to relearn where your tongue is supposed to  go and where the different sounds are. I taught myself how to whistle again too. But there are still sounds I can’t make.’

Carmit’s final operation took place when she was 18, when bone was taken from her head to build a bridge in her nose.

Thankfully, treatments have improved dramatically since then. Nigel Mercer, consultant cleft surgeon at the South West regional cleft unit in Bristol, says: ‘The UK leads the world in cleft care, and while 30 years ago children would have 17 or 18 operations, we avoid that now.’

These days, there are only three ‘must-have’ operations during childhood. The first is  a lip repair, usually done at three months, which also fixes the hard palate in the roof of the mouth. The second is a soft- palate repair at the back of the throat at about nine months.

Then, at around eight years,  bone is taken from the patient’s hip or shin and put into the gap  in the top of the mouth.

Orthodontic work is needed in the early teenage years to align the teeth properly.

The condition may also cause ear problems – children under three need monitoring for glue ear, which can affect hearing and impede speech. Half of all British children with the condition will need speech therapy.

A final operation can take place on the nose between the ages of 18 and 20 as patients sometimes have problems breathing through the nostrils.

Despite the excellent treatment, cleft lip and palate – which can  be detected in foetuses at the 20-week scan – remains grounds for abortion in the UK. Carmit was horrified to find that was the case. ‘I can’t believe a doctor would perform an abortion when this is correctable with no residual physical disability, especially now we’ve come so far in this field,’ she says.

She did not even take the cleft palate scan when she was pregnant with her daughter, Keala Rose, who is now 18 months.

‘I was terrified she’d have to go through what I went through, so I was overjoyed when I looked at her for the first time. She was amazing – perfect in every way.’
