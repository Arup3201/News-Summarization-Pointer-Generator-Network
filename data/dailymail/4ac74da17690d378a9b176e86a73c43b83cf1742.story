It is a sweltering summer afternoon on Tyneside. A player once billed as the successor to Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United trains with his fellow outcasts, while their team-mates and manager are 12,000 miles away in New Zealand.

Afterwards, he drives to the suburb of Gosforth - birthplace of Alan Shearer - and takes a seat in the window of Adriano’s Deli. He orders a coffee and reads newspapers from across the Continent, where he will learn that Ligue 1 Evian are interested in signing him.

No-one bothers him, no-one bangs on the glass asking for an autograph or selfie. No-one, including the club by whom he is employed, cares much for what he does.

Gabriel Obertan has turned his Newcastle career around after it appeared dead in the water this summer

Newcastle United’s Gabriel Obertan is the forgotten man. Like Hatem Ben Arfa, his former comrade at France’s prestigious Clairefontaine academy, he has been told to find a new club.

Ben Arfa subsequently goes to Hull City on loan but Obertan remains, returning to Adriano’s most days as reward for his efforts in training, often with no senior staff watching.

Three months on, however, and Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is very much aware of Obertan. Without him, four points from matches against Leicester and Swansea would have been just one. He, and four-goal Papiss Cisse, have saved their manager.

On Saturday Obertan scored in a 1-0 win over Leicester. It was his first home start in two seasons and first Premier League goal in 32 months.

‘When you spend three or four months without playing then you start doubting. You sometimes let yourself go a little bit,’ admits the 25-year-old winger, who arrived in England in 2009 when signed by Manchester United.

‘This time was different, I just kept going. If people think that you’re done, that’s their problem. As long as you remember what you have done in the past and believe in yourself then it will go your way at some point.’

Go his way it has. Obertan has spent a week accepting praise and thanks from team-mates and staff at the same training ground which, during the summer, proved such a lonely place. Popular and intelligent — ‘he speaks better English than all of us,’ said one source — he has not spoken about his exile.

‘It was difficult, you don’t know how to handle the situation,’ he told BBC Radio Newcastle. ‘You get impatient and frustrated (but) you can’t always blame someone else. You have to look at yourself and work through these difficulties. It will pay off.

‘These lows build your character. It gets to you and you feel left out but then you think about the situation... it could be worse.

‘I’m still in a great club, working hard and trying to make a name for myself. I am turning things around. I hope it is a resurrection of my career here.’

It was Sir Alex Ferguson who paid Bordeaux £3million for Obertan in 2009, the same summer he sold Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m.

Both right wingers, there was an inevitable and unfair comparison, something Obertan despised.

Ferguson, in his autobiography, wrote: ‘He was greased lightning. But in the final third his feet were sometimes all over the place. His task was to co-ordinate his feet with his brain and deliver the hurt in the final third.’

At Old Trafford, he never did. Likewise, in his first three seasons at St James’ Park, feet and brain were often at odds. Not any more.

Three months ago, he asked himself how badly he wanted it.

‘That’s what it’s about,’ he says. ‘It’s easy to work when people see you, it’s another thing to work when they don’t. You have to wake up and still do it. No coaches are there to pat you on the back.’

This week, there have been plenty of pats on the back. He might even have to forgo his favourite seat at the coffee shop.
