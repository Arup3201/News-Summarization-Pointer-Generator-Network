The first pictures of David Beckham's planned stadium in Miami can be revealed by MailOnline Sport.

The 25,000-seater venue, set to be situated at the Port of Miami, will include a restaurant and a nightclub in an open concourse, as well as a world-class sporting arena.

The as-yet-unnamed stadium would host 17 MLS games during the regular season, between March and November, as well as additional post-season games, soccer friendlies, and other entertainment. Most games would be on Saturday nights.

Grounds for optimisn: The planned stadium - for the 23rd MLS franchise - is in a prime location on the Port of Miami

The port is one of four potential areas 
for the new stadium, which Beckham's team say will create a new 
destination for Miami residents.

A central plaza on the site will include cafes, restaurants and shops.

Beckham and his partners will pay for the
 stadium without County or local taxpayer dollars, while the team will 
also help to grow football's prominence in Miami-Dade County by creating
 a new youth academy.

The vision includes plans to regenerate the port's old bridge into the city's 'high line,' on which supporters of the new team would walk to the match, as well as space for future development around the Port.

The other potential sites in the city are the FIU, the Miami International Center and Marlins Park - home of baseball outfit Miami Marlins.

The 25,000 capacity would make the new ground the third-biggest crowd in the MLS, equalling the size of Thierry Henry's New York Red Bulls' Red Bull Arena.

Teams like New England Revolution and Vancouver Whitecaps have bigger stadiums, but capacity for 'soccer' crowds is topped at below 25,000, with the teams sharing with American Football sides.

It also means the team will pull in a bigger crowd than the city's basketball team Miami Heat, home to superstar LeBron James.

However, as revealed by Charles Sale, Beckham’s stadium plans for the new franchise are being opposed by the cruise line companies who dock in one of the world’s busiest ports.

Royal Caribbean Cruises have ‘deep reservations’ and have tabled a strong objection because they have their own plans to develop the 12 acres that Beckham and his investors have pinpointed.

Asked why he chose Miami, the former 
Manchester United and Real Madrid star said: 'Why not? All joking aside,
 I wanted to create a team that we can start from scratch with.

'This is an exciting time for myself, family and friends. We're really looking forward to bringing this to Miami.

'There
 was a team here 10 years ago but going forward I wanted to create a 
team that's very personal. I want to make it my own team.

'Miami is a vibrant city with a lot of passion. I know it's ready for football and this will be successful.

'I'm committed to this league and I'm committed to this sport.

'There are a lot of people who want to know what we're doing and how we're doing it. I'm not in this to make money.'

Meanwhile, it's understood the 38-year-old wants Barcelona star Xavi to join him in Miami for his new venture.

The
 midfield maestro, who played in Barcelona's 4-3 win over Real Madrid on
 Sunday night, is tied to the Catalan giants until 2016 when he will be 
36 and, despite interest from elsewhere, he has made it clear he wants 
to see out his career at the Nou Camp.

But Beckham would hope to persuade Xavi to have a swansong with his 
Miami-based club. The franchise are not expected to be ready to start until 2017.
