Loss: Manny Edwards, 18, died after accidentally running into a bus stop. He suffered a cardiac arrest after the collision

A teenager died following a freak accident when he ran into a bus stop while hurrying for a late-night bus.

Manny Edwards, 18, collapsed after he struck the sign in Walkers Heath, Birmingham, just before 10.30pm on Monday, West Midlands Police said.

Dispelling rumours that he had been the victim of an attack, police said CCTV footage showed Mr Edwards running for the number 35 bus, getting to his feet following the impact with the sign, and then fall to floor again seconds later.

Police officers and paramedics attempted to revive Mr Edwards, from Kings Heath, at the scene but he died in hospital. he had suffered a cardiac arrest.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Inglis said: 'This was a terrible accident.

'It’s shocking that a young man could lose his life in such circumstances.

'We understand there were some rumours flying around the community that there was something sinister behind Manny’s death and that he had been attacked - but I can assure people that is certainly not the case.

'CCTV footage shows him running across the road and colliding with the bus stop. No one else was involved in the incident.

'Our thoughts go out to Manny’s family and friends as they try to come to terms with his tragedy.'

A post-mortem examination will now take place to confirm the precise cause of death and a file will be prepared for the coroner.
