A woman who killed her Navy doctor husband has told the court that she cannot remember stabbing him 10 times after learning of his affair.

Jennifer Trayers, 43, is on trial for stabbing her husband Navy Lt. Cmdr. Frederick Trayers eight times in the back and twice through his chest - piercing his heart.

Prosecutors claim that when Trayers learned about her husband's affair with attractive blonde, Danielle Robins, 31, she snapped and murdered him in bed at their San Diego home in December 2010.

The widow testified that she had not planned to kill her 41-year-old husband and that 'he didn't deserve to die', reports 10news.com.

The married ER doctor had met his mistress while they were both working aboard the USS Mercy in 2010.

Trayers said she had tried to talk to her husband of 20 years about his infidelity when he returned from a night shift, but he said he wanted to sleep and would speak to her later.

'I wasn't thinking clearly, I hadn't slept all night. All I was thinking about is 'why won't Fred talk to me about this?'  she said, reports 10news.com.

Trayers said she got a butcher's knife and asked her husband how to cut her wrists and commit suicide as he was reading in bed after taking sleep medication.

Instead of stopping her as she had hoped, Trayers said her husband told her she needed a sharper knife, and presented her with a military knife.

According to 10news.com, she claims her husband then told her about a key artery in her arm so she could kill herself.

'I'm getting angry. Why is he telling me this? I'm very confused by his actions.' she told the court.

Trayers said she put the knife to her chest and asked where her heart was, to which her husband said 'lower'.

'I was getting really mad,' Trayers said, according to 10news.com. 'I've never felt that way before.'

Trayers testified that her husband tried to take the knife from her, and as they wrestled he stabbed her in the chest.

She said she then stabbed her husband in the back of the neck, before blacking 
out. She claims she does not remember stabbing him again.

Trayers lay by her dead husband for two days before police broke in to find the bloody couple in bed and Trayers barely alive

Mr
Trayers was stabbed a total of 10 times: eight times in the back and 
twice in the chest. He also suffered defensive wounds to his hands.

On the stand, Trayers admitted that she had ended her husband's life but insisted, 'I didn't do it on purpose'.

Police
broke into the couple's home two days later, and discovered Mr Trayers 
dead in bed with his wife who had taken sleeping pills and was suffering from 36 wounds, reports 10news.com.

During
her testimony,Trayers admitted she felt angry at her husband's mistress
and had sent Robins an email the morning of her husband's 
death accusing her of 'ruining' their marriage. 

In her eight page email, she told Robins; 'My husband is NOT going to be yours'.

The defendant had been monitoring her husband's email to his mistress for weeks using software on their computer.

Trayer's lawyer does not deny his client killed her husband but claims she  is guilty of voluntary manslaughter, not murder. The trial continues.
