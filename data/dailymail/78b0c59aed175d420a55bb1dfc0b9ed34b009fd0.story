The band on stage at The Clutha on Friday night carried on playing even after the helicopter crashed – and even joked that their performance was ‘bringing the roof down’.

Amazingly, Glasgow ska band Esperanza assumed the collapsing ceiling was a minor problem.

Audience member Grace Maclean, 22, said: ‘Above the music, I heard a loud whoosh and a wooden panel fell down near the stage.

‘No one had a clue about what had happened. One of the musicians joked, “Looks like we’re bringing the roof down.”’

However, the scale of the accident quickly became apparent, she added. ‘There were shouts of alarm and the band stopped. A thick black cloud of dust swept over us. I could barely see a few inches in front of me.

'I could feel hands grabbing me and people shouting, “Get out!” There was no real panic just a feeling of, “What the heck is going on here?”

‘I made it outside – only then was I told a helicopter had crashed.’
