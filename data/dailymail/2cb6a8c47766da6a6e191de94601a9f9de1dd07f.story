A former Playboy model accused of assaulting two women at the same nightclub just months apart will fight one of the charges, a court has heard.

Georgina Gosden, 25, made a brief appearance in Townsville Magistrates Court on Tuesday to contest a charge laid against her for allegedly attacking a former school friend at the Mad Cow nightclub.

Gosden, from Townsville in north Queensland, is said to have punched the 25-year-old in the face a number of times on April 20 last year, Townsville Bulletin reported.

Georgina Gosden, 25, is a model for Playboy and has contested an assault charge laid against her 

It is alleged Gosden punched a woman in the face at Mad Cow Tavern in Townsville, on April 20 2014

Phil Rennick, the model's solicitor, requested that his client's charge of assault occasioning bodily harm be put down for a summary hearing.

The matter was adjourned by Magistrate Ross Mack until Friday so police can review their information, but the accused will not be required to attend court again.

The glamour model previously fronted court in December last year accused of punching a 21-year-old woman in a similar attack, at the same nightspot - Mad Cow Tavern.

She was granted bail, and is not contesting this charge according to Mr Rennick. 

She also has one other assault charge against her for allegedly punching a woman at the same bar in December 

On December 8 Magistrate Cathy Wadley agreed to let Gosden out on bail, despite police prosecutor Errica Forde advising against it with fears the model would re-offend, Townsville Bulletin reported at the time. 

Gosden allegedly punched a 21-year-old woman in the face at Mad Cow Tavern on Sunday about 10.40pm.

The victim walked into the nightclub while the model was already inside.

It is alleged Gosden then got up from where she was sitting, ran towards the woman and punched her in the face.

Court documents say the woman was known to Gosden who told police 'she was going to find her [the victim]'.

In April's incident, the alleged victim went to school with Gosden and said the model came out of nowhere and punched her in the face.

Gosden stands accused of carrying out two similar attacks about seven months apart 

She appeared in Townsville Magistrates Court on Tuesday, where her solicitor asked the charge to be put down for a summary hearing 

Gosden signed with Playboy earlier this year and described herself as a 'tomboy' in high school in a video on its YouTube channel

'I walked inside the nightclub, I turned to my right and had only taken about three steps and was looking around. Then I saw someone in a long green fluorescent skirt coming ­towards me quickly from my left,' the victim told police, according to the Bulletin. 

In a video on the Playboy YouTube channel, Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who grew up in Townsville and was born in England.

She described herself as 'outgoing' and a 'fun-type of girl'.

'I teach young kids to ride horses. It’s very rewarding. I’ve been riding since I was 9, I try to ride horses every day,' Gosden said. 

April's incident allegedly involved her punching another woman several times in the face

Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who was not 'very girly' when she was in high school

She was granted bail by the magistrate and her case was adjourned until Friday 

Despite her budding career as a glamour model, Gosden confessed she was not 'very girly' when she was younger.

'The type of girl I was in high school, I was definitely a tomboy. I wore baggy shirts and board shorts,' she said.

'I wasn't very girly until a lot later on when I started to get those curves in all the right places.' 

The model's case will be heard in court again in January.

Gosden will be opposing the charges that have been brought against her.
