The battle over scallop stocks in the English Channel escalated yesterday when militant French fishermen threatened to mobilise a 250-strong armada to block British ferries.

The ultimatum came as British trawlermen demanded Royal Navy protection from the French who have already fired flares and rocks at their boats.

The French – who also tried to ram British boats – are furious that ‘British intruders’ have been fishing for the lucrative mollusc in Seine Bay, off the coast of Normandy.

EU laws prevent British vessels in 
this area from fishing within 12 miles of the French coast, but the 
British boats were at least 15 miles offshore when they were attacked.

Footage
 of the attack has been broadcast on French television and local 
newspaper Manche Libre published a headline saying ‘The Scallops War is 
Declared’.

Warning: French scallop trader Claude Milliner

Now the French have threatened to 
launch a modern-day armada against the British, with 250 vessels set to 
cause havoc by blocking cross-channel ferries.

Claude Milliner, a scallop trader at 
Port en Bessin, said: ‘Our government is doing nothing to protect us 
from the British intruders who are pillaging our livelihood.

'We will not
 hesitate to call out 250 boats or more. Our fellow trawlermen at the 
other ports are with us. Our battle is their battle.

‘This situation is going to end badly. We have had enough. We will do what it takes to win the war.

‘We
 have enough boats along the Channel coast to cause disruption by 
blocking the ferries. We don’t want to but if we have to, we will.’

French
 fishermen are demanding a ban of all fishing in the Bay of Seine in 
order to replenish its cash-rich stock of fish and scallops.

They
 imposed a voluntary ban on fishing through the summer but when they 
returned on October 1 they were angry to see how much had been harvested
 by British boats.

British 
fishermen believe the attack earlier this week had been premeditated 
because one of the 40 French vessels had a television cameraman and an 
interpreter on board.

The ‘frightening’ attack lasted for 
more than six hours and came to a halt only when a French Navy vessel 
and the French coastguard intervened.

The Royal Navy was deployed to protect British fishermen during the Cod Wars with Iceland in  the 1970s.

In 1972, Iceland had declared an Exclusive Economic Zone beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing.

This led to the Icelandic Coastguard cutting the nets of British trawlers that fished in the area.

The UK retaliated by deploying Royal Navy warships to protect British fishing crews.

There followed a number of stand-offs between UK and Icelandic vessels, which included them ramming each other.

The lengthy dispute finally  ended in 1976 when Iceland threatened to close a vital Nato base in retaliation for the deployment  of the Navy.

The British Government conceded that UK vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200- nautical-mile limit.

Now
 British fishermen are demanding protection from the Royal Navy’s 
three-strong Fisheries Protection Squadron (FPS) which patrols the UK’s 
Extended Fisheries Zone.

Andy
 Scott, of Scott Trawlers in Dumfries, Scotland, had to call Marine 
Scotland for help when one of his skippers telephoned to say his crew 
were under attack.

The crew of the vessel were forced to hide in the wheelhouse as rocks and iron bars were thrown.

He said: ‘The skipper was very concerned for his safety and the safety of the crew. They were really helpless.

‘I could hear on the telephone the rocks and bricks raining down on the wheelhouse window.

‘The
 Fisheries Protection Squadron would be a welcome sight.

'It would be 
comforting to know that we had some help nearby if things escalate 
again.’

The FPS is the 
oldest front-line force in the Royal Navy, dating back to 1481.

Its 
mission is to protect the extended fisheries zone – an area covering 
80,000 square miles of sea and stretching up to 200 miles from the 
coastline.

The squadron comprises three River 
Class Offshore Patrol Vessels – HMS Tyne, Mersey and Severn – in UK 
waters. A fourth – HMS Clyde – is stationed in the Falkland Islands.

Frustration: Angry French protestors have called on EU authorities to impose a temporary ban
 on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of 
shellfish and catches

Anger: French trawlers confront the larger British trawler, in the centre of the picture,  during the standoff

The
 1,700-tonne vessels, each with a crew of about 45 sailors, patrol 
English, Welsh and Northern Irish waters. Scotland has its own fleet.

They can operate with helicopters, carry two rigid inflatable landing 
craft and are armed with one 20mm gun and two general-purpose machine 
guns.

However the Navy says 
it has  no plans to send one of its three River Class vessels to the 
scene. Instead British authorities are relying on the French government 
to deal with its fishermen and stop the ‘Scallops War’ from escalating.

Rod
 Henderson, head of coastal operations for the Marine Management 
Organisation, said: ‘We are continuing high-level discussions with 
French counterparts to seek assurances that these issues will not 
recur.’

But Mr Milliner added: ‘We will do what we have to do to preserve the future of our industry.

‘For 25 years we have imposed a ban on fishing scallops during the summer up until the autumn. But the British are legally entitled to fish while we have to sit and watch.

‘What is making us even more angry is the fact that thousands of tons of the British-caught scallops are exported back to France and sold as local produce.’

French fishermen have proved true to their word when they have threatened a blockade in the Channel. In 1996, trawlermen sailed dozens of boats into the harbour mouth at the cross-channel port of Calais, roped themselves together and blocked its entrance.

They delayed tens of thousands of passengers and hundreds of lorries for two days before the government gave into their demands for European Union benefits.

What is crystal clear after this week’s skirmish in the Channel  is that the  British fishermen were doing nothing wrong, writes analyst David Derbyshire. 

They were dredging for scallops in international waters – defined as more than 12 miles from the coast – when they came under attack.

The dispute is complex and its origins goes back years.

The French have long accused British trawlers of over-fishing – and putting scallop stocks at risk – in and just outside their waters.

For commercial reasons, they resent the fact that two thirds of the scallops caught by British boats are exported – with a large number ending up in France, undercutting their own shellfish prices.

And they are frustrated by a self-imposed rule which bans French dredgers from catching scallops in the Bay of Seine off the Normandy coast between May 1 and October 1.

The ban – which extends to 15 miles from the French coast – does not affect British fishermen.

This year rumours of a bumper year of scallops reached UK ports in September. Within days a dozen British boats were in international waters off the Normandy coasts. By the time the French set sail on October 1, they had missed out on weeks of rich pickings.

The French concede that the British are acting lawfully. But they believe it is unfair that UK boats can steam across the Channel to pick the best scallops while they can only watch.

The Gallic authorities say the closed scallop season prevents over-fishing and allows the scallops to spawn in peace.

But Dr Ewan Bell of the Government-funded Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aqua-culture Science, said: ‘As far as I’m aware there is no particular scientific justification for that closed season. There are peaks in their spawning but you can find spawning scallops all year round.’

Jim Portus, of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, says the French closed season is a marketing ploy that owes more to protecting prices than protecting fish.

‘It’s an arbitrary season,’ he said. ‘We can only assume that it ensures the market is concentrated into the seven months of open season so they get a better price.’ Scallop fishing is big business in Britain.  In the UK, 50,000 tons of the shellfish worth about £54million are landed at ports each year.

All but 2 per cent are caught by vessels using dredges – 3ft-wide spiked metal rakes that scrape along the seabed picking up the shellfish. It is a brutal and crude form of fishing that does untold damage to the sea floor and which is banned in the most important conservation areas.

Scallops are not endangered and there are no fixed EU quotas restricting the size catches. But to prevent over-fishing, fisherman must follow complex rules covering the size of equipment, the type of dredgers, the size of scallops they can harvest and how many days they spend at sea each year.

Each EU nation may dredge for scallops in its own coastal waters and in any international waters. But nations may set their own restrictions.

Just as the French have a closed summer season off Normandy, British boats are banned from fishing for scallops in the Irish Sea from June to the end of October.

And just as UK fishermen can ignore the French restrictions, there is nothing to stop a French boat looking for scallops in the summer off the coast of Wales. In practice, they rarely bother because  travelling so far is uneconomical.

This week’s tension partly stems from the failure of talks this year over the Bay of Seine. France and Britain were close to a deal in which UK boats would stay away from the area in the summer in exchange for being given some of France’s unwanted ‘days at sea’ quota.

But fishermen from Brittany objected. They were concerned the British boats would head west and start competing with them.
