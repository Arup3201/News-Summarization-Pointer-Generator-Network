New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
 has criticised the Occupy Wall Street protesters for unfairly blaming 
'hard-working' people for problems facing the U.S.

Around
 1,000 protesters tried to confront some of New York's wealthiest 
tycoons yesterday afternoon as they held a 'Millionaires March' in 
Manhattan to the homes of five top businessmen.

But
 Mayor Bloomberg fumed: 'I don't appreciate the bashing of all the hard 
working people who live and work here and pay the taxes that support our
 city.'

Huge cheque: Protestors affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street protests chant outside the home of billionaire David Koch in New York on Tuesday

Placards: People representing Occupy Wall Street and other groups hold a march on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to protest policies they claim favour the super rich in New York

Beginnings: The Occupy Wall Street movement, which is protesting a wide variety of issues and started in September, is continuing in New York and is spreading to other cities around the country

The protesters marched to the houses of Rupert Murdoch, JP Morgan Chase 
CEO Jamie Dimon, billionaire David Koch, financier Howard Milstein and 
hedge fund mogul John Paulson.

But Mayor Bloomberg gave his backing to Mr
 Dimon, saying he is an 'honourable person' who pays taxes and has 'brought more 
business to this city than maybe any other banker in the modern day'.

Protesters are today expected to protest outside the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase in New York.

During the march protesters were bearing
 oversized cheques in an attempt to symbolise how much less the wealthy 
will pay when New York's two per cent ‘millionaires' tax’ expires at the
 end of the year.

‘99 per 
cent of the residents of New York are going to suffer from this tax 
giveaway so the one per cent who already live in absolute luxury can put
 more money in their pockets,’ one organiser said.

Cameramen: The media was out in force on Tuesday to cover the march, with most networks represented

Message: Protesters wanted to tell the super rich that they are not contributing enough in taxes

Watching on: People appeared on their balconies and one gave a thumbs-up to the protesters

Left out: Protesters leave a cheque outside the door of one of the businessmen they were targeting

'A lot of these Republicans are 
basically saying: ‘You know what? Let’s go back to the same policies 
that led to the great recession in the first place",' he told ABC.

‘This is fiscally, economically and morally wrong,’ Doug Forand told the New York Daily News.

It comes as Barack Obama's senior 
adviser David Plouffe confirmed that the President is on the side of the
 Occupy Wall Street protesters - and said the Republicans are not.

On the move: Occupy Wall Street demonstrators yesterday began their march towards the homes of some of New York's wealthiest businessmen

News Corp CEO Mr Murdoch, who has been engulfed in the
phone-hacking scandal over the last few months, is worth 
$7.4billion - but that is overshadowed by David Koch, who comes in at 
$25billion.

Earlier this month Berkshire Hathaway 
chairman Warren Buffett - who is worth $39billion but is not being 
targeted on the march - said he would release his tax return if Mr 
Murdoch did so as well.

New
 York Governor Andrew Cuomo is worried the rich will leave the area if 
the tax is renewed, despite calls from fellow Democrats to keep it going
 as it generates up to $5billion annually.

Unhappy: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg slammed the protesters as they held a march

‘They live in luxury - these folks 
don’t need a tax break,’ an Occupy Wall Street spokesman told amNewYork.
 He was annoyed they are being given more money while others make 
sacrifices.

already live in absolute luxury can put more money in their pockets'

The march started near Central Park on 59th Street and headed north at around 12:30pm yesterday.

A
 spokesman for Occupy Wall Street told MailOnline earlier that the 
protesters would leave their camp at Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan on
 Tuesday morning and travel on the subway to begin.

Around 1,000 protesters had gathered 
by Central Park just after midday and began the march up Fifth Avenue 
and Park Avenue, with onlookers watching what was happening from their
 balconies.

Demonstrators held banners saying 'Millionaires should pay their share' and 'Tax the rich', while crowds chanted and sang as drums were played. There was also a big trade union presence.

No arrests or public disorder have been reported on the route, but onlookers said police had to keep protesters on the pavement outside Mr Dimon's house after his awning was closed off.

Many banners included in protests around the U.S. read: ‘We are the 99 per cent’.

This is referring to what they say are the vast number of Americans struggling to pay their bills while the income gap between the rich and middle class widens.

Whistle blowers: Protesters are stopped by a security guard at the doors to the Bank of America building during a demonstration on Tuesday in Atlanta

Demonstrators camping in a downtown Atlanta park as an outgrowth of Occupy Wall Street in New York vow to stay despite city warnings they have to go.

The group Occupy Atlanta said in a statement this week that they've met with city officials and were told that police will enforce Atlanta's ordinances against camping and being in the park overnight. There were no reports of any arrests during a sit-in on Monday night.The protesters were still there early Tuesday.

Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said police planned to continue monitoring the situation in Woodruff Park.

Mayor Kasim Reed's chief of staff Candace Byrd told WSB-TV late Monday that officials were giving the protesters a chance to leave the park but declined to say what would happen if they didn't.
