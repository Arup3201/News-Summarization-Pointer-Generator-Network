The strong military presence which surrounded England's arrival in Rio on Sunday continued as Roy Hodgson's squad headed off for their first training session in Brazil.

With their World Cup opener against Italy now just five days away, captain Steven Gerrard and his team-mates travelled to the Urca military base on Monday morning to step up their preparations.

The Three Lions, who left the Royal Tulip Hotel on their team coach, were followed by a large contingent of soldiers in an armoured vehicle.

The ultra-cautious approach mirrored the scenes on Sunday as Hodgson's men entered their hotel for the first time.

A
 host of military personnel lined up to watch over the 23 Premier League
 stars and it was exactly the same as Wayne Rooney and Co departed for 
their session under the shadow of Sugar Loaf mountain.

England
 will be put through their paces in the Brazilian heat for the first 
time in a fully open session, before taking part in closed work-outs on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.

Hodgson
 and his players will then fly to Manaus on Thursday, where they will 
train in the jungle-like conditions they can expect against Cesare 
Prandelli's side on Saturday night.
