Lord Steel insisted yesterday that he was ‘perfectly happy’ to recommend Cyril Smith for a knighthood and said ‘a man is innocent until proven guilty’.

In an extraordinary defence of his own – and the Liberal Party’s – conduct concerning the serial sex abuser, the peer again insisted he knew  nothing of Smith’s vile activities.

Lord Steel claimed he was only aware of a Private Eye article in 1979 detailing how the 29-stone monster spanked young boys’ bare bottoms.

Claims: Ex-Liberal leader David Steel (right) Lord Steel said there 'is no question' Cyril Smith (left) would be 'up for assault now', but argued that at the time corporal punishment 'went on'

He said he challenged Smith about the allegations – but took no further action.

The
 former Liberal leader reacted angrily to suggestions that it was 
negligent not to pursue ‘gossip and tittle-tattle’ that erupted about 
the Rochdale politician after the satirical magazine report.

In
 a fractious BBC radio interview, he said: ‘We’re a political party, not
 a detective agency and idle gossip is not a basis for any inquiry at 
all.’

Asked about claims by
 fellow Liberal peer Lord Alton that he had ‘facetiously’ said Smith’s 
behaviour was no different from conduct at public schools, Lord Steel 
said: ‘You say it is a facetious remark. But it happens to be true that 
in those days corporal punishment was permitted.’

Labour
 MP Simon Danczuk, whose book revealed the full extent of Smith’s abuse 
of young boys, said: ‘It is quite clear from Lord Steel’s response that 
there was no appetite to get to the heart of the very serious rumours 
that were circulating about Cyril Smith.

Lord Steel said he confronted Cyril Smith over his 'unusual behavior' at a hostel in Rochdale

‘The
 general public will be very disappointed that, as the leader of a 
political party with just over a dozen MPs at the time, he did not want 
to thoroughly investigate.

‘This
 wasn’t about idle gossip, this wasn’t about an MP who had had a few too
 many pints or an extra-marital affair, this was about one of his MPs 
having sex with children.’

Mr
 Danczuk, whose book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril 
Smith was serialised in the Mail this month, added: ‘Now he can describe
 it as idle gossip and rumour but the wider public will be truly 
horrified and take it very seriously.’

Lord
 Steel’s interview comes amid growing calls for a public inquiry into 
the scandal over Sir Cyril Smith’s four decades of child abuse. On 
Monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover-up of 
Smith’s activities in Rochdale.

Yet
 senior Lib Dems including Nick Clegg continue to claim they knew little
 of the true extent of Smith’s abuse. Mr Clegg has said he sees no need 
for an internal inquiry.

But
 Mr Danczuk, whose book tells of appalling events at Knowl View 
residential school in Rochdale, says there is clear evidence of an 
establishment cover-up and an internal investigation is needed.

Kevin
 Griffiths, who was 14 when he was molested by Smith in a Rochdale 
hostel in 1964, said yesterday: ‘Lord Steel was told Cyril Smith  had 
skeletons in his closet, heard about the rumours and yet he failed to 
conduct his own investigation. 

Despite these accusations he  suggests 
Smith could be innocent until proven guilty which I find insulting.’ 
Deciding to speak publicly for the first time since the scandal erupted 
17 days ago, Lord Steel – who led the Liberals between 1976 and 1988 – 
admitted he challenged Smith saying: ‘What’s all this in Private Eye?’ 
and he said: ‘Yes, the report is true.’ Private Eye went on to say the 
police had investigated but no further action had been taken.

He
 told World at One presenter Martha Kearney: ‘This was a different era, 
corporal punishment was permitted. It would be totally illegal now, 
there is no question he would be up for assault now but in those days it
 went on.

Probe: On Monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover-up of Smith's activities in Rochdale

‘These were 
allegations that were ten to 15 years old. Since then and, after the 
closure of one of these institutions, he had gone on to be elected 
mayor, he was awarded the MBE by the Labour Party for services to local 
government. I had no locus in the matter at all.’

He
 dismissed claims he should have done more to investigate, saying: ‘Why 
should I? There was no allegation about his behaviour as an MP. There 
are now allegations which have come to light since his death and these 
are very serious but they were not known to us.’

He
 admitted he did not ask the police or the Liberal party in Rochdale 
about the allegations. ‘They were ancient allegations about his time as a
 local councillor, nothing to do with his life as an MP and anything 
that has emerged since was not known to me or to anybody else.’

Allegations: Lord Steel claimed he was only aware of a Private Eye article in 1979 detailing how the 29-stone monster spanked young boys' bare bottoms

Lord
 Steel defended recommending Smith for a knighthood, despite the 
rumours. He said: ‘He had been the distinguished MP for the area for 15 
years, he had announced he wasn’t standing again, he was in poor health,
 his life expectancy was unknown – many MPs got knighthoods at 14 and 15
 years and I was perfectly happy with that.’

Asked
 if Smith should have been prosecuted, Lord Steel said: ‘It sounds as 
though he should have been, yes, and certainly if these things happened 
today he would undoubtedly be prosecuted.

‘A
 man is innocent until proved guilty. I hope these current inquiries 
will lead to some conclusion. I think the victims deserve to have their 
questions answered.’
