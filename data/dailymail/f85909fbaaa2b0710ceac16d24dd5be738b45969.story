Brazil will not grant asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, a local newspaper reports.

Yesterday, Snowden released an open letter addressed 'to the people of Brazil' where he offered to help the South American nation investigate US spying on their soil, but that in order to do so, he needs to be granted political asylum.

However, the Brazilian government has no interest in investigating the information revealed by Snowden in June and does not intend to give him asylum, government officials were quoted as saying in Sao Paolo paper Folha de S.Paul.

Hard sell: Edward Snowden has previously sought asylum in Brazil and now is trying to get the public on his side by writing an open letter, describing how he would be able to help in their fight against surveillance

Snowden's lengthy letter said that 
he's been inspired by the global debate ignited by his release of 
thousands of National Security Agency documents, and that the NSA's 
culture of indiscriminate global espionage 'is collapsing.'

In
 the letter, released widely online, Snowden commended the Brazilian 
government for its strong stand against spying and wrote that he would 
aid them in investigating claims that Brazil is one of the victims of 
NSA - if they give him asylum.

However, several Brazilian politicians, mainly opponents of Rousseff's leftist government, said granting Snowden asylum would be counter-productive and would lead to further deterioration of ties with the United States, the country's largest trading partner after China.

Revelations about the NSA's spy programs were first published in June, based on some of the thousands of documents Snowden handed over to the Brazil-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald and his reporting partner Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker.

The documents revealed that Brazil is the top NSA target in Latin America, spying that has included the monitoring of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's cellphone and hacking into the internal network of state-run oil company Petrobras.

The revelations enraged Rousseff, who in October canceled an official visit to Washington that was to include a state dinner. 

She's also pushing the United Nations to give citizens more protections against spying.Handle

In his letter, Snowden dismissed U.S. 
explanations to the Brazilian government and others that the bulk 
metadata gathered on billions of emails and calls was more 'data 
collection' than surveillance.

'There
 is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying ... and 
these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations 
under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever,' he wrote.

'These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power.'

Brazilian senators had asked for Snowden's help during hearings about the NSA's targeting of Brazil, an important transit hub for trans-Atlantic fiber optic cables that are hacked.

Both Greenwald and his domestic partner David Miranda spoke before the senate, and Miranda has taken up the cause of persuading the Brazilian government to grant political asylum to Snowden.

Snowden, who is living in Russia on a temporary one-year visa, previously requested political asylum in Brazil and several other nations.

On Tuesday, neither Brazil's Foreign Ministry nor the presidential office said they had immediate comment on Snowden's letter or any pending asylum request.

'Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world,' Snowden wrote.

'Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too.

â€˜The culture of indiscriminate worldwide surveillance, exposed to public debates and real investigations on every continent, is collapsing.'

Several members of Brazil's congress have called for Snowden to receive asylum, so that he could assist lawmakers' investigation into NSA activity in Brazil.

Rousseff recently joined Germany in pushing for the United Nations to adopt a symbolic resolution which seeks to extend personal privacy rights to all people.

The Brazilian leader has also ordered her government to take several measures, including laying fiber optic lines directly to Europe and South American nations, in an effort to 'divorce' Brazil from the U.S.-centric backbone of the Internet that experts say has facilitated NSA spying.

The Snowden letter was first published Tuesday in a Portuguese translation by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. The AP later obtained the original English version.

It comes one day after a U.S. district judge ruled that the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search.

The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court for a final decision.
