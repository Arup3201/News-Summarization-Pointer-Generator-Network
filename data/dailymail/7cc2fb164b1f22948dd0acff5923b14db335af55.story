Not content to just sack fellow rookie Johnny Manziel, St. Louis Rams defensive end Michael Sam taunted the quarterback with his own signature 'Show Me The Money' finger rub after a brutal tackle.

Previously, Sam had hit the headlines for becoming the first football player with a shot at the NFL to come out as gay, while Hesiman winner Manziel has gained notoriety for his confident attitude and hard partying.

Manziel has made his 'money sign' his trademark, much to the chagrin of many opponents and onlookers.

The pair met Saturday night when the Rams met the Cleveland Browns in a preseason game.

The hit was Sam's second sack of the season.

USA Today reports that the two spoke after the game was over.

'He came up to me and said hello,' Manziel said. 'He's been heckled a lot. He played pretty well.'

Sam, a college football star in Missouri, is hoping to be the NFL's first openly gay player.

The hit was Sam's second sack so far as he fights to make the team's final cut

He's still fighting to be on the team when the Ram's announce final cuts on August 30.
