With the ski season well underway now is the time of year that many holidaymakers will be jetting off to the pistes of Europe for some fun in the snow.

But if you have been left stranded at home this winter longing for the enjoyment of the slopes, or just prefer a pair of slippers to ski boots, then fear not - as this amazing 360 degree video will let you enjoy the thrill from your computer.

Using the arrows at the bottom of this clip, you can watch from every angle as professional ski racer Bruno Kernen zips down the 2.7 mile-long Lauberhorn mountain track in the Swiss Alps at speeds approaching 100mph.

In order to rotate the video press and hold on the arrows at the bottom, or hold down the left mouse button and drag it across the video screen

Bruno Krenen has captured the longest professional ski run in the world using a specially adapted camera on his helmet allowing it to be viewed from every angle

The camera can be rotated through a full 360 degrees. This shot comes from the same point on the course as the previous one, but viewed from Krenen's left hand side

Using a specially adapted camera fixed on to his helmet, Kernen has captured the longest downhill race track in the world, allowing people to watch as the flags zip past his face, or rotate the lens to watch the slope disappear into the distance.

Using the magnifying glass keys, viewers can also zoom in and out for a closer look at the scenery of the famous mountain range, though the speed at which Kernen takes the corners of the run might make it difficult to concentrate.

The FIS Ski World Cup is being held on the course this weekend, attracting skiers from across the globe to compete in downhill, slalom and combined events.

Krenen can also be seen leaning through the twists and turns of the course by rotating the camera so it is facing backwards

The run was filmed at Lauberhorn in the Swiss Alps during the FSI Ski World Cup which is taking place there this weekend

Kernen is a professional skier who won gold in the 1997 Sestrières downhill event, along with a silver medal at the same event in the combined category, and a bronze medal at a different event in 2007.

In 2003 Kernen won a bronze medal on this course in the downhill event, and has a corner of the track named after him after crashing there in 2006.

This year marks the 84th annual Ski World Cup at Lauberhorn. The event is watched live by tens of thousands of spectators on the mountainside, and on television by over a million people each year.

The race, which started in 1930 and is therefore one of the oldest in the world, costs around £4.2million to stage and brings in around £3.4million for the region.
