A meteorologist had a shock when a giant spider appeared above her head as she warned viewers of upcoming rain showers.

Canadian forecaster Kristi Gordon shrieked when spider legs started to crawl across a camera lens during a live broadcast.

The Global BC presenter jumped as the spider made its way into shot and could not contain her horror as it crawled across the screen.

Meteorologist Kristi Gordon got a shock when she spotted what looked like a giant spider crawling towards her head during a live broadcast

Gordon shrieked and put her hand to her head, even though the spider was on the camera lens

Even though colleagues reassured her the spider was not in the room, Gordon still kept her distance

With admirable restraint, Gordon kept her language clean as the spider loomed overhead and probably sent shivers down the spine of many viewers.

She screamed: 'Oh my gosh, that was creepy!'

Gordon darted across the screen to dodge the approaching arachnid as her colleagues laughed at the unfolding drama.

'Of course it had to be right on my head!' she said, clearly suffering while trying to stay bright and breezy.Â 

Ever the professional, Gordon kept her language clean as she darted around the studio floor

The encounter left Gordon unsettled.

'I hate it, I can't stand it,' she said, trying to regain her composure, before ducking away for a second time.

Despite a news anchor colleague 
shouting: 'Kristi, it's not in the room, it's ok!', the spider was still
far too close for comfort.

The forecaster tried her best to regain her composure but still found the sight of the spider unnerving

Producers turned the screen blue to try to disguise the spider but Gordon was still unsettled

Sympathetic viewers sent supportive message to Gordon's Twitter profile.

She replied to one: 'I was crying! Just didn't want to show on-air so I kept laughing to regroup.'

Another tweet read: 'Embarrassingly not the first time freaked out by spiders, bugs, snakes and Halloween.'

Last August, Gordon had another close encounter with the insect world when a bug 'divebombed' her face during a live report.
