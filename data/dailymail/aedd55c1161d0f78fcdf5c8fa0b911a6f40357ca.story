A wealthy owner lost his entire collection of up to a dozen elite cars in a £2.1 million blaze in Moscow, which police say may have been caused by arson.

Totally destroyed in the early morning fire were six Rolls-Royces, two Bentleys and two Mercedes.

The luxury vehicles were parked in a garage around one mile from the Kremlin in central Moscow.

The owner evidently used the cars to ferry wealthy VIP Russians to 'a club for clients with special demands'.

He has not been named, and the nature of his business, called Sinus, is not yet clear.

'The fire occurred at about six o'clock in the morning. Among the burned autos were Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Mercedes cars. Police do not rule out arson,' said a spokesman.

Police said the vehicles belonged to a single owner. The Moscow emergencies department confirmed the information, without elaborating.

The burned out shells of the destroyed luxury cars were widely shown across the Russian media

The spectacular blaze covered 50 square metres but the fire service extinguished it within 30 minutes of being called to the scene
