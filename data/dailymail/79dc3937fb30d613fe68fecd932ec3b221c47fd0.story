iPhone users love – or loathe – Siri, the ‘intelligent personal assistant’ that recognises voice commands.

And so far Windows Phone owners have had to live without a similar feature to the one that Apple rolled out in October 2011.

But a video that claims to show Microsoft’s forthcoming digital assistant has been leaked online.

Windows Phone 8.1 is the upcoming third generation of Microsoft's Windows Phone mobile operating system.

It is expected to be unveiled next month and is rumoured to feature a swipe-down notification centre and the Siri-like personal assistant, according to The Verge.

The digital assistant is expected to be called Cortana and this video leak adds weight to the rumour.

Cortana is said to be poised to replace Bing Search.

Just like Apple's Siri, users will be able to talk to it and ask questions.

The assistant has a start-up process that asks users lots of questions to tailor its suggestions from the onset.

Windows Phone 8.1 is expected to make its debut at the Build Developer Conference in April, where it is rumoured that Nokia will also launch two new Windows Phone handsets.

The UnleashThePhones video shows Microsoft's assistant, called Cortana, running on what seems to be a Windows Phone 8.1 handset.

Microsoft describes the personal assistant as ‘a personal assistant on your phone, ready to help with reminders, suggestions, tasks and lots more’.

Cortana seems to make use of location, voice input, text messages email information and contacts as well as browser and search history to learn about a user’s habits after they sign into their Microsoft account.

It asks questions such as ‘What are a 
couple of the most enjoyable parts of your everyday evenings?’ and ‘When
 you think about food, what’s most important to you these days?’ so it 
can offer tailored suggestions.

This
 set-up feature is different to Apple’s Siri or Google’s Now, which asks
 questions to tweak suggestions later on instead of asking a user’s 
preferences from the outset.

If the video is to be believed, Cortana only kicks in when a person asks it to, either by accessing the assistant from the start screen or at the press of the search button.

The website claims that the assistant is still ‘a work in progress’ so its appearance may change.

Cortana has long been rumoured to be added to Microsoft’s operating system and there have been numerous leaked screenshots, but this is the first video of the fabled feature, which is expected to make its debut next month at Microsoft's Build Developer Conference in San Francisco, California.
