A three-meter shark forced swimmers out of the water at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Saturday afternoon, sparking panic and bringing the whole beach to their feet.

Beachgoers were evacuated from the packed water in the early afternoon, after lifeguards spotted the huge shark in the water, setting the beach's shark alarm off.

The alert comes just hours after a second great white shark was found dead in nets 400m off the coast of Bondi Beach in Sydney, sparking fears for swimmers as the temperatures began to heat up.

Jetskis were deployed to check out the water and ward off the shark, and people on the beach were prevented from re-entering the ocean.

Karl Hayes, editor for TriZone, was down at a packed Bondi Beach covering the first Bondi Splash and Dash race, when the alarm went off.

'The shark came in and just cleared the beach. The photos I took shows it was a big one, at least three meters long,' Mr Hayes said.

'Everyone got out of the water pretty quickly and the lifeguards launched the inflatables and jetskis and head off into the ocean,' he said.

The shark alarm continually sounded, and Mr Hayes said that many beachgoers appeared panicked. 

'The lifeguards found the shark and were trying to herd it away from the beach, trying hard to get it to leave out of the north end,' Mr Hayes said.

Mr Hayes said that people were eventually allowed back in the water, and seemed to have recovered from the shock of the shark sighting pretty quickly.

'People were back in the water and already swimming out near the rocks where the shark was,' he said.

'I had been out doing some underwater photography earlier in the day for the site and kept looking around, keeping an eye out,' he said. 

He said that those who were competing in the Splash and Dash Race were aware of the sharks that had been caught in the nets during the week, including former Olympian Courtney Atkinson and Commonwealth Games Bronze medalist Aaron Royle.

'Everyone was a bit nervous but they did the race anyway without too many dramas,' Mr Hayes said. 

'It was a fantastic event, and I think it'll become an institution,' he said.

The sighting comes just hours after the second great white shark in a week was found near Bondi Beach.   

Ian Puckeridge, who works as a spear fisherman, spotted the shark lying dead in the net on Friday morning, Channel Seven reports. 

He told 7News said: 'It's quite awesome to see them in the water when they're alive, not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net.' 

It is estimated the shark had been trapped in the net for about two days. 

The Department for Primary Industries reportedly told 7News that inspectors had not found the shark on Friday morning and could not confirm it was caught in the nets. 

The first shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department at around 11.30 am on Wednesday. 

It was taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy.

Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf.  

This second 2.5m great white shark was found dead at Bondi Beach on Friday morning

A spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries told Daily Mail Australia: 'A male great white shark of approximately 2.5m in length was found in a shark net off Bondi Beach.' 

'The shark was found during routine inspections by specialist contractors who carry out operations as part of the NSW Shark Meshing Program,' the Department confirmed.

'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes, as is practice for some sharks caught in our shark nets as part of national and international research projects. This will be carried out by DPI research staff.' 

Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was definitely from Bondi Beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.'

'It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures.

'The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,' Mr Wenham added. 

'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out.

Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, said shark nets 'are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out'.

'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes,' a Department spokesperson said

'In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn't die in vain,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,' Mr Kennedy said.

'Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don't want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.'

Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries.

The nets are generally 150 metres long and 6m wide and can be established 500 metres from the beach.

'The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,' a Department spokesperson said.

'The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,' they added.
