It is 23 years since a professional footballer in Britain last revealed he was gay.

And in an attempt to stamp out one of the game's last remaining stigmas, a Premiership star has become only the third footballer to appear on the cover of the UK's leading gay magazine.

West Ham United winger Matt Jarvis features on the front of February's Attitude and claims the sport is more than ready to welcome any footballing stars wanting to come out.

The married 26-year-old's appearance on the front of the magazine follows on from David Beckham and Freddie Ljungberg, who both appeared in the previous decade.

Jarvis believes there would be no issue should any footballers decide to come out.

'It's everyday life,' he said. 'It's not something that's going to be a shock.

'I'm sure there are many footballers who are gay, but when they decide to actually come out and say it, it is a different story.

'It's one that I'm sure they've thought about many times. But it's a hard thing for them to do.'

Jarvis feels the mechanisms are in place to help out any player who chose to take what would be a pioneering step.

'There'd be support everywhere within the football community, whether it be players, fans or within the PFA [Professional Footballers' Association],' he said. 'There would definitely be groups of people who would be supportive and help them through it.'

No professional footballer has come out publicly in Britain since Justin Fashanu in 1990.

The former Norwich, Hearts and Nottingham Forest player killed himself eight years later. The prejudices he faced after coming out as gay were cited at the inquest into his death.

Changes in attitudes within football were highlighted following a recent study by the University of Staffordshire which suggested the majority of fans would welcome players coming out as gay.

The study, as reported by The Independent, found that 40 per cent of fans blamed clubs and agents for keeping gay footballers under wraps.

Attitude's editor, Matthew Todd, however, believes football has a problem with homophobia and needs to tackle it in the same way it is with racism.

'It's ridiculous that there are no openly gay players in professional football,' Todd said.

'There's rightly been a focus on ridding the beautiful game of racism, but there doesn't seem to be much effort to tackle homophobia.

'We know there are gay players – and fans who support the game religiously – so I hope this starts a discussion and is a small step in the right direction.'
