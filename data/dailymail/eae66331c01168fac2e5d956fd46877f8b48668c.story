Two athletes have died running the Rock N' Roll Half Marathon Sunday in Raleigh, North Carolina, the first time the event was held in the city.

One runner died near the finish line, while the other was striken earlier in the race course. The identities of the two runners have not yet been released, thought at least one of the dead is a man.

The race was not interrupted as a result of the deaths.

The runners were among  more than 12,000 competing in the event, which also included a full marathon. Rock 'n' Roll marathons are held in cities across the United States, and also some abroad.

The deaths were confirmed in a statement by marathon medical director P.Z. Pearce. He did not cite the causes of death.

'We are greatly saddened by these tragic losses and our prayers go out to the each of the runner's family and friends,' the marathon's medical director, P.Z. Pearce said in a statement. 'We have spoken with each of the families and they have asked everyone to kindly respect their privacy during this most difficult of times.'

Alex Granados was on the sidelines watching the race and was waiting for his brother to finish.

'All of a sudden some people in line started calling for a medic. A guy had collapsed about a hundred yards down from me,' Granados told the News & Observer. 'The paramedics came and spent 10 to 20 minutes furiously doing chest compressions. After a while, they got him on a gurney and wheeled him by me.

'It’s so sad because he was right near the finish line when he collapsed,' Granados added. 'Two more minutes and he would have made it.'

Weather does not appear to have been a factor in the deaths. When the race started at 7 a.m. start, temperatures were in the mid-50s. However, the high temperature for the day was expected to be 80 degrees.

Emergency medical personnel with Wake County said 29 runners were treated during the race as well as two spectators. Of those, 10 needed to be taken to hospitals.
