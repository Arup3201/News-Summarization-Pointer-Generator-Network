Conscience: Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, who conducted the Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, says the jailing of Knox was political

The judge who cleared Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito has spoken of how he and the jury reached their verdict by 'following their conscience.'

In an unusual move judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, 68, gave an interview to a local newspaper in which he explained why Knox, 24, and Sollecito, 27, were declared not guilty after more than ten hours of deliberations.

Judge Hellmann, who has been a judge for more than 40 years, also added that he felt their was a 'political background' as to why the American - who has returned home amid amazing scenes - had been kept in jail.

Speaking to La Nazione at the end of the ten month appeal in Perugia he said:'I'm a little bit tired but I managed to survive and that's one important thing.

'I had an optimum jury and a optimum assistant judge (Massimo Zanetti) and we reached the verdict by following our conscience.

'This was a difficult case, controversial but we did what was in our conscience.'

When asked about bitter criticism of the verdict from prosecutors Giuliano Mignini and Manuela Comodi, who called it a 'massive mistake' judge Hellman replied:'I don't know about that.

'They will read the sentence and they can make their valuations.'

Judge Hellmann will release his 'motivations for sentence' within three months and this will explain in detail why he and the jury decided to release Knox and Sollecito from their 26 and 25 years jail sentences.

It will be examined closely by the prosecution in Perugia who have already said they plan to appeal and take the case to the Supreme Court in Rome and they have 45 days from when judge Hellmann releases his report to file a request.

Any potential hearing would not take place until late next year and Knox and Sollecito do not have to attend - the decision will be based solely on documentation from the case to see if procedure was correctly followed.

Judge Hellmann added:'I went to bed serene, that's for sure but I didn't sleep very much as I was so tired, it was a late night.' Then speaking of the booing and jeering that accompanied the verdict by a crowd who had gathered outside the court he said:'There was too much tension.

Decision: Judge Hellmann reads out the verdict, which will be released in full in three months

'There was too much attention on this case and that was because of the excessive media interest. People got fired up. That's why I said what I did (before retiring) that it was not a football match and I didn't want cheering.

'Instead well...too much was made out if it. Then there is the political background, many wanted Amanda in prison because she was American.'

Meanwhile it also emerged today that police and prosecutors had no intention of reopening the investigation with prosecutor Comodi saying: 'There is no question of a fresh investigation because as far as we are concerned Meredith was murdered by Amanda, Raffaele and Rudy (Guede).'

Ivory Coast drifter Guede, 24, was sentenced to 30 years in 2008 after a fast track trial found him guilty of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal.

However in his sentence report the judge ruled that Guede committed the murder 'with others' and he claimed in a hearing his accomplices were Knox and Sollecito although they always denied this.

As a result of the appeal verdict Guede himself could now ask for a retrial although and his lawyer Valter Biscotti said it was a possibility he was looking into although if he was again found guilty he could get life.

Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was murdered in 2007, just two months after she arrived in Perugia as part of her Leeds University degree.

Her family have been left wondering just who killed her and for months there have been rumours swirling Perugia that Guede was involved in the murder with others.

During the original trial Carlo Dalla Vedova said that fingerprints from other people had been found at the murder scene and never identified.Â
