As one of the most glamorous stars of reality TV, Sam Faiers is well-known for her immaculate sense of style.

And while you'll never catch her without a pair of false eyelashes on, it isn't for vanity's sake. In fact, the 23-year-old suffers with Trichotillomania - a disorder which causes her to pull out her real eyelashes.

Left without any natural eyelashes, Sam was forced to wear falsies for years - and now she's using her experience to branch out into a new beauty venture.

Expert advice: The range includes three styles of false eyelashes, including 'Oh! So Natural', which Sam has designed to complement daytime makeup

Glamorous: The second look - 'If Looks Could Kill'  - is her favourite style and has been designed to create more volume for an elegant seductive look

Speaking to MailOnline as she launches her debut false eyelash collection, Sam said: 'I suffer from Trichotillomania, which is a condition where I have the compulsion to pull out my eyelashes. I've been wearing false eyelashes since I was 16 so this seemed like a perfect avenue for me to go into.

'I've been to see lots of people to try to help me overcome this but it hasn't worked so I have to wear eyelashes as I don't have any real ones.'

Sam, who wants to be known as 'Samantha', has created three signature looks for her Lashes by Samantha range that she says are perfect for every occasion. 

The first, 'Oh! So Natural', is a chic addition for your daytime makeup, she says. The second look -and her personal favourite - 'If Looks Could Kill', has been designed to create more volume for an 'elegant seductive look'.

Bold: The final set of false lashes - 'Glam it Up', is for the super glamorous woman who wants to make a statement, she says, as she models the range herself 

Channeling her expertise: Speaking about her new lashes, which range in price between £6-£6.25 a pair, she said: 'I've bought thousands of lashes over the years as I wear them everyday'

The final, 'Glam it Up', is for the super glamorous woman who wants to make a statement, she says.   

'I'm really proud of my range,' she explains. 'I really think they are the perfect lashes - everyone I have given them has been complimented whenever I wear them.'

Sharing her top tips for applying falsies, the expert said: 'Trim the outside, not the inside of the lashes to suit your eyes size, put the glue on and wait a few seconds until it gets tacky and put them on with tweezers to ensure they are on securely.'

Sam has been showcasing some seriously sophisticated style lately - and her appearance at The Hunger Games premiere this fortnight was case in point. 

Speaking about her red carpet experience, she said: 'Because I had such a special dress on from DVF, I wanted the focus to be on that. So I opted for a glossy, glamorous look with a little bit of bronzer and a glossy lip. I wore my Lashes By Samantha 'Glam it Up' look as it was such a big occasion.

'It was absolutely amazing. I love Jennifer Lawrence, she's the ultimate celebrity in my eyes. She's so honest and beautiful, you just know she's herself, which is something that I love. 

'I'm obsessed with the Hunger Games franchise, I've read all the books and I was so excited that I saw the cast in the flesh for the first time.'

Sam's idols: The reality star loves actresses Jennifer Lawrence, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley

It isn't just Jennifer Lawrence that the reality TV star admires - she's been taking inspiration from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, too.

Speaking about her beauty icon, she said: 'She is really someone who I get inspiration from beautywise. She always looks so effortless but so glamorous at the same time. I use rosehip oil underneath my makeup as she swears by it.'

Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder which causes people to pull out their hair, which could be from the hair on their head or hair on other parts of their body, which eventually leads to bald patches.

It is a psychological condition and therefore people who suffer with it are not able to stop themselves from pulling out their hair as they feel an intense urge to do so as it causes a sense of relief. 

Her new lash line is only the latest addition to her burgeoning 'By Samantha' range, which also includes her award-winning fragrance, La Bella. 

'I think that I'm growing up and really finding my feet in the fashion and beauty industry,' she said. 

'I have my fitness project launching in January, which is really exciting. I can't wait for everyone to see it and experience it. I also have a new collection from my range with Very, which will be out in January. There will also be more products from the 'By Samantha' range.'

It seems that The only way is up for Sam since leaving the Essex show behind. 

Lashes By Samantha will be available on Very.co.uk, prices from £5 to £6.25
