He was named as the sexiest ginger man in a poll last month, beating actors Michael Fassbender and Damian Lewis into first place.

But Prince Harry insisted to the wounded servicemen and women joining him on his 124-mile South Pole trek last year that his beard was blond, it has been revealed.

The 29-year-old royal grew his facial hair during the epic 10-day journey, but told crew members that it was definitely not red.

Growth: Prince Harry insisted to the wounded servicemen and women joining him on his 124-mile South Pole trek last year that his beard was blond

Exhausting trek: The 29-year-old royal grew the beard during the epic 10-day journey last December

Team members said that Harry had been asking them: ‘Do you think it’s blond?’ - and when they told him ‘no’, he replied ‘Well, at least I’m not grey', reported the Daily Star.

The revelation of the joke comes as a new clip of Harry to be screened on TV shows the moment he suffered a health scare during his trek last December.

The footage shows Harry laid low by crippling altitude sickness and exhaustion that forced him to rest for 36 hours wile trekking across the Antarctic.

As doctors check he still has feeling in his limbs, the prince admits: 'Antarctica jumped up and bit me on the ass.

Eventually, on December 13, Harry and the rest of the team reached the South Pole in record-breaking time

Harry undertook the journey dragging an 11st sledge over the snow and ice, alongside 12 servicemen and women from the UK and teams from other nations.

But the exertion and the high altitude, as well as dehydration combined to leave him drained. During the eighth day, after a nagging headache, he tells a medic: 'It feels as though it's expanding. It's getting worse and worse.'

Harry explains later: 'If you show a weakness to Antarctica, I think it exploits it. And I think it will slowly grind you down until you have the utmost respect for it, which I now have.

'I thought I could come out here and just crack on and see it through without any issues, make sure I'm here for the guys when they need me.

Harry took part in the 10-day Walking With the Wounded challenge in December last year

'I'm frustrated and disappointed in myself, but it really does prove how physically and mentally tough these guys are,' he said of his fellow adventurers, some of whom had lost limbs or suffered other injuries during service in Afghanistan.

After checking whether he had vomited from the sickness, medics ordered Harry to rest for 36 hours, which he found frustrating.

‘Being tent-bound really sucks. I don't really enjoy sitting around and doing nothing, especially when I know they're walking 17km (11 miles).

Alongside other teams from the US and commonwealth, the Royal hiked 124 miles to the South Pole

The trek was originally a race, but after conditions became dangerous the competition was abandoned

Foul weather conditions, with 
temperatures plummeting as low as minus 40C eventually led to the 
competitive race element of the challenge being abandoned, with the 
teams eventually arriving at the South Pole together on skis.

Relieved
 Harry said of his team at the finish: 'I'm so happy for them. They've 
done so well - every single person, but especially these guys and girls.
 I'm honoured and privileged to be here with these guys. It's been very 
special.'

Harry was named 
the sexiest ginger man last month in a British Heart Foundation poll, 
which saw actor Nicole Kidman come top in the women's category.
