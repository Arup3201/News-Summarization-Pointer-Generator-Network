Spanish TV personality Adriana Abenia was so worried about looking silly on a gameshow that she decided to cheat but got caught before she could answer even one question.

The blonde beauty, 29 who has appeared on the cover of the Spanish edition of FHM, was supposed to identify well-known songs so downloaded the app Shazam to her mobile and then hid the phone between her legs.

As the first song played, she surreptitiously switched the phone on but did not bank on the app which can identify songs and singers within seconds sending her a text message causing the screen to light up.

Fingers on rather large buzzers: Model and TV personality Adriana Abenia, 29, has to identify a song from 1974. Is it Waterloo by Abba?

The show’s host Christian Galvez spotted the giveaway light and asked Abenia what was going on.

The embarrassed Abenia – who was voted 63rd sexiest woman in the world by FHM's readers  – confessed all.

‘To be honest I think she deserves a special prize anyway because in seven years of organising this TV contest, nobody has ever done anything like this and certainly not quite as brazenly,’ said Galvez.

Indeed some of the viewers posted comments online saying it had been one of the best and most fun episodes in the show’s history.

The idea of the show is to identify well-known songs and singers. Adriana Abenia did not think she had what it took so decided to cheat

Not that kind of buzz: Abenia reacts as the mobile between her legs vibrates to tell her that the app Shazam has identified the song
