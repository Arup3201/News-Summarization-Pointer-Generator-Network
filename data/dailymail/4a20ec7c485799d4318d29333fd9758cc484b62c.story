Former Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger was sentenced Thursday to life in prison for his murderous reign of terror in the 1970s and '80s, bringing to a close a case that exposed FBI corruption so deep that many people across the city thought he would never be brought to justice.

Bulger, 84, was defiant to the end, calling his trial on racketeering charges a sham and refusing to testify or provide information to probation officials preparing a sentencing report for the judge.

A jury convicted Bulger in August in a broad racketeering indictment that included murder, extortion, money-laundering and weapons charges.

The jury convicted Bulger in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with participating in but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a conclusion on an eighth.

victims.

They called him a terrorist, a punk and even Satan.

Prosecutors called him a sociopath.

On Thursday, Casper told Bulger the depravity of his crimes is 'almost unfathomable,' calling them 'heinous' and 'all about money'.

Bulger looked directly at her, listening intently.

'The testimony of human suffering that you and your associates inflicted on others was at times agonizing to hear and painful to watch,' Casper said

'At times during the trial I wished that we were watching a movie, that what we were hearing was not real.'

She then sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences plus five years, as prosecutors had requested.

Juror Janet Uhlar speaks with reporters after the sentencing hearing for James 'Whitey Bulger in Boston

Bulger, the inspiration for Jack Nicholson's sinister character in the 2006 movie 'The Departed', was seen for years as a Robin Hood figure who bought Thanksgiving turkeys for working-class South Boston residents and kept hard drugs out of the neighborhood. 

But that image was shattered when authorities started digging up bodies more than a decade ago.

Prosecutors
 at his two-month trial portrayed him as a cold-blooded, hands-on boss 
who killed anyone he saw as a threat, along with innocent people who 
happened to get in the way.

Corrupt Boston FBI agents protected 
Bulger for years while he worked simultaneously as a crime boss and an 
FBI informant who ratted out the rival New England Mafia and other crime
 groups.

On Wednesday, several family members blasted corrupt FBI agents for protecting Bulger for years while he was working simultaneously as a crime boss and an FBI informant who ratted out the rival New England Mafia and other crime groups.

'This man¿s built up so much hate in my heart that I¿d like to strangle him myself': Steve Davis, brother of murder victim Debra Davis, told the court he hopes 'Whitey' dies 'gasping for breath'

The son of a man who was gunned down by Bulger in 1974 addressed Bulger as 'Satan' and described how his father, a member of a rival gang, first disappeared in 1974 but wasn't found until decades later when his body was discovered in a watery grave.

Sean McGonagle was 11 when his father, Paul, disappeared.

He said Bulger called his family's house the following year and said, 'Your father won't be coming home for Christmas'.

When he asked, 'Who's this?' Bulger responded, 'Santa Claus,' McGonagle said.

'You're a domestic terrorist fueled by greed and sickening evil,' McGonagle said.

Tommy Donahue, the son of murder victim Michael Donahue, told reporters he had waited 31 years for someone to pay for his father's death.

'That old bastard is finally going to be in prison, he's going to die in prison,' Donahue said.

'It’s bittersweet but it’s a damn good feeling.

The next time I ever want to hear anything about him, I hope he’s dead.'

The jury failed to make a decision on the murder of Debra Davis, who died of strangulation in 1981.

The victim's brother, Steve Davis, broke into tears as he looked at Bulger and told the court: 'This man’s built up so much hate in my heart that I’d like to strangle him myself.'

Davis said he is convinced Bulger strangled his sister.

'I hope Whitey dies the same way my sister did, gasping for breath as he takes his last breath,' he said.

The FBI used these projections of James 'Whitey' Bulger during their hunt to find him. He was one of America's most wanted men, on the run for 16 years

David Wheeler, the son of a businessman 
who was shot between the eyes by a hit man for Bulger's gang, delivered a
 blistering condemnation of both the FBI and the Justice Department, 
which successfully argued to have his family's wrongful death lawsuit 
dismissed on the grounds that it was filed too late.

'They are as responsible for that murder as the defendant here sitting before you,' Wheeler said.

Former Boston FBI agent John Connolly Jr. — Bulger's handler when he was an informant — was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of tipping him off ahead of an indictment.

After receiving the tip in 1994, Bulger fled Boston and remained a fugitive for more than 16 years until he was captured in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2011.

Connolly was later convicted of second-degree murder in Florida for leaking information to Bulger that led to the slaying of a gambling executive.
