The parents of a Georgia nurse who was killed in a Chevrolet Cobalt with a defective ignition switch say a General Motors engineer lied to cover up the fact that the company knew about the problem.

General Motors is facing mounting pressure over the 2.6million vehicles it has recalled over the defect. The company has admitted that the problem caused 13 deaths - though families say the death toll is even higher.

Adding to the insult, some grief-stricken families who lost loved ones in faulty GM vehicles have received recall notices from the company.

Ken Melton sobs as he looks at the mangled Chevrolet Cobalt that killed his daughter Brooke in 2010

Brooke Melton's family settled a lawsuit with General Motors over her death. But, they are re-filing their lawsuit and claiming GM withheld information

Brooke Melton, 29, died in March 2010 in Georgia when he 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt stalled, hit another car and dropped 15 feet down a ravine.

A crash investigator found that the key was in the 'accessory' position, which would have shut off the airbags, power steering and anti-lock brakes.

Ken and Beth Melton sued and settled with GM in September 2013. But they have re-filed the suit, alleging the company withheld evidence that the company knew about the defect for ten years.

They tell CNN Money that GM lied to them about what the company knew when their daughter died. 

The new lawsuit singles out Ray DiGiorgio, the head engineer who designed the ignition switch. He told the Meltons' lawyers that he had submitted no requests to change the design of the switch - meaning that GM didn't realize it was a problem.

However, documents later emerged that DiGiorgio had requested to redesign the device after flaws were found, according to CNN Money.

GM says DiGiorgio has been suspended, pending an internal investigation.

'They thought they had the truth when the settled the case. We now know that they had some of the truth, but not all of the truth,' the Meltsons' lawyer Lance Cooper said.

Brooke is not one of the 13 deaths counted in the GM figure because her death was not the result of a front-impact crash. This has led consumer advocates to say the faulty ignition switches could have resulted in many more fatalities.

It has also been revealed that GM recently sent recall notices to the families victims killed because of the faulty switch. The company has issued an apology.

'We are deeply sorry to those families who received a recall notice,' said GM spokesman Greg Martin.

Terri DiBattista, who lost her 16-year-old daughter Amber Marie Rose in a 2005 Maryland accident involving a Chevrolet Cobalt, told Reuters she received two recall notices from GM last week asking her to bring in the vehicle to fix the ignition switch and power steering. The car was destroyed when Rose crashed into a tree.

The postcards were mailed to the family at its new address in South Carolina, where DiBattista said they moved to recover from the loss. Sent by a local GM dealer, the cards detailed three different recalls GM has issued involving the Cobalt in recent months.

DiBattista said GM could have identified the destroyed car through a simple check of Vehicle Identification Numbers.
