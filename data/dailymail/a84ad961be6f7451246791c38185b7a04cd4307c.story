Speculation about Apple’s smartwatch has been circulating for years but its reveal date is now being tipped for next Wednesday.

However, those Apple fans anxious to get their hands, or wrists, on the device may be facing an expensive bill when it goes on sale in 2015.

Reports from Recode claim Apple executives have discussed charging $400 for the upcoming device - a third more expensive than Samsung’s current high-end model.

California-based firm Apple is rumoured to unveil its smartwatch at an event next week and reports now claim the so-called iWatch (concept pictured) could go on sale next year for $400 (£240). This would put it at the high-end of the smartwatch market

This would put Apple’s iWatch at the high-end of the smartwatch market - a strategy that mirrors the firm’s approach to its iPhone business.

By comparison, Samsung’s Gear 2 costs $299.99 in the US (£249 in the UK) and the Moto 360 is expected to cost $249.99 (£149).

Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5-inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch.

Last week, Samsung launched its curved S watch, but didn’t announce how much it would cost.

Apple’s biggest rival could be waiting to see how much the iWatch will cost, if it is unveiled next week, before setting its own price.

Apple sent invites out for its upcoming launch event last week.

Reports claimed at the time that the iWatch will be unveiled at this event, but won’t go on sale until 2015 to give developers time to write apps for the device.

The iWatch is likely to run a modified version of the upcoming iOS 8 software, but the app size and functions will need to be different to accommodate the smaller screen, processing power and watch tools.

Timex’s Ironman One GPS+ watch costs $400, but features its own 3G wireless connection, as does the Samsung S.

This suggest Apple’s device could have a similar connection option.

By comparison, Samsung’s Gear 2 (pictured left) costs $299.99 in the US (£249 in the UK) and the Moto 360 (pictured right) is expected to cost $249.99 (£250 in the UK) when it launches later this year

Apple has already hinted at the wearable in the latest update to its iOS software, which includes health tracking capabilities.

'The new device will, predictably, make good use of Apple’s HealthKit health and fitness platform,' Recode said

'It will also - predictably - make good use of HomeKit, the company’s new framework for controlling connected devices - though it’s not clear how broadly or in what way.'
