Angry passengers complained of ‘chaos’ while they were stuck in long queues at Edinburgh Airport last night after security workers failed to show up for work.

Hundreds of travellers became trapped in the queues with many reporting delays of an hour while staff scrambled to clear the backlog – just a few hours before the start of National Sickie Day.

Passengers claimed to the Edinburgh Evening News that they were told 13 out of 14 security workers called in sick, but the airport insists only three staff members were absent.

Angry passengers complained of ‘chaos’ while they were stuck in long queues at Edinburgh Airport

At the height of the disruption, queues filled with disgruntled holidaymakers stretched from security checkpoints to check-in desks.

David Mason told the newspaper he waited more than an hour before passing through security prior to his flight to Dublin.

The 56-year-old management consultant said: ‘I was told that 13 out of 14 security staff members had called in sick. The crowd is being very patient at the moment, but I’m sure that could change. There has been absolutely no information given to passengers.’

A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport told MailOnline Travel the delays occurred when a 'high number' of passengers arrived while some employees were absent.

He said: ‘We did have a period last night where we had a lot of passengers arrive at the airport in a short period of time.

‘Things were resolved pretty quickly and there haven’t been any repeat issues since.’

The spokesman said a ‘huge amount’ of passengers arrived between 5pm and 7pm, and the situation resolved itself at about 8pm as the backlog cleared.

He said he doesn’t know why so many workers were absent on the same day, adding it was ‘certainly not a protest’.

Edinburgh Airport said individual passengers were called forward so they wouldn't miss their flights

The spokesman added: ‘It was an unfortunate incident but our teams on the ground were working really hard to get people through as quickly as possible.

‘If a flight was getting ready to depart we were calling people forward so they didn’t miss it.’

Frustrated passengers sent tweets to the airport’s Twitter account or to their own followers while they were stuck in a queue.

Gareth Price wrote: ‘Chaos at #edinburgh airport this evening!! Very long queues to get into security!! Arrive early!!’

Edinburgh Airport responded to its followers with a series of tweets apologising for the delays.

Edinburgh Airport said the delays were caused by an influx of passengers while some staff were absent

Some Twitter users speculated the mass absence had something to do with National Sickie Day. The first Monday of February is traditionally when the highest number of workers ring in sick on a single day.

Others wondered if it had anything to do with the Old Firm derby involving Celtic and Rangers.

In November, best-selling Scottish author Ian Rankin lashed out at Edinburgh Airport security after he was caught in a lengthy queue with other travellers.

The 54-year-old Inspector Rebus author vented his frustration on Twitter, where he complained about the airport’s ‘overrun’ system while he was delayed.

Edinburgh Airport denied his claim that the delay he experienced was due to the trialling of a new £25m security hall alongside its existing one.
