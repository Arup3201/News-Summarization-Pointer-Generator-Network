A scientist discovered a new species of wasp less than a millimetre long living in a tree in his son’s school playground.

Dr Andrew Polaszek, an insect expert at London’s Natural History Museum, found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree.

He said: ‘I noticed some of the whiteflies looked slightly different to the others so I took them to the laboratory. When I saw the wasp inside I knew it looked different to anything I’d seen before.’

The 54-year-old found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree five years ago - but tests to establish the wasp as a new species have only just been completed

Dr Polaszek, 54, made the discovery five years ago at Sevenoaks Primary School in Kent, where his son Timothy was a pupil.

But rigorous tests to establish the wasp as a new species – named Encarsia harrisoni – have only just been completed.

The wasp, which Dr Polaszek named after fellow Sevenoaks scientist Dr David Harrison, is a parasitoid, meaning it lays its eggs inside other insects.

He added: 'When I saw the wasp inside I knew it looked different to anything I'd seen before but I thought it might be a species from Northern Europe that had come over to the UK. I was really surprised when I realised it was native to the UK and was previously unknown.

'Finding an undiscovered insect in the rainforests of Borneo is relatively easy but the fauna of England is some of the most studied in the world so to find something new here is a real thrill, and makes it even closer to my heart.

'And you never get over that thrill of peering down a microscope and realising what you're looking at is something new.'

Initial DNA testing showed the insect to be unknown anywhere on earth, but rigorous research and testing had to take place.

The wasp had to be checked against other similar creatures and a detailed scientific description written before it could be confirmed.

The official description of the Encarsia harrisoni, which the species is now called, was officially published last week in the Entomologists' Monthly magazine.

Sevenoaks Primary School, Kent, where the new species of wasp was discovered by Dr Andrew Polaszek

During five years of regular collecting, no males have ever been found, which suggests it could be a uniparental species.

Dr Harrison is chairman of trustees at the Harrison Institute which promotes taxonomic research to support biodiversity studies and conservation.

But 88-year-old Dr Harrison, who has been studying mammals since he was nine, is no stranger to seeing his name associated with scientific breakthroughs.

He said: 'I now have a flea, a bug, a sand cat and a wasp named after me, which is obviously quite an honour. Dr Polaszek's wasp is a particularly interesting one - it was found right here in Sevenoaks just a few hundred yards from my home.

'People have been studying the fauna of Britain for more than two centuries and these things don't tend to happen very often. It shows how remarkable the environment can be you can find something so remarkable in the most ordinary place.'

Dr Polaszkek confesses even though he's travelled the world looking for insects he rarely walks past a plant - even in the UK - without studying it for insects.

He added: 'It sounds strange but it's what I do. I'm always looking at plants and the insects on them.

'I work with some of the smallest insects on Earth, sometimes as small as a fraction of a millimetre long, so I'm used to looking for miniscule things most people wouldn't even notice.'
