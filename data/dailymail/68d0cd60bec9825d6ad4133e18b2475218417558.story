The 64-year-old woman branded the 'nanny from hell' over claims she was refusing to leave the house of the California family who hired her has claimed she was the victim.

In an interview with ABC's 20/20, broadcast Friday night, Diane Stretton claimed that Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte took advantage of her.

Stretton also said that she wanted to move out but claimed that because the couple had allowed the media in it was making it hard for her to collect her belongings.

Diane Stretton claims the Bracamonte family took advantage of her when she moved into their home

The 64-year-old had moved in with the Bracamonte family after answering an advert they had posted on Craigslist at the start of the year.

At the time Stretton was homeless and having to sleep in her car, which was affecting her health and causing her legs to swell.

SHe said that the job offer - light help around the home and watching over the children in return for free bed and board - had seemed like the ideal solution.

'For 20 hours a week [of] work, I'd get my legs up and take care of my heart condition and get to sleep in a bed,' Stretton told 20/20.

But she claims that the work load was unreasonably added too, and said the couple took advantage because they knew she had nowhere else to go.

'I feel very exploited and very much 
taken advantage of ... They knew that it would be 
difficult for me to do something else,' she said.

The Bracamontes claimed that Stretton had been like part of the family when she first moved in, but later refused to work

Stretton told 20/20 that the family had wanted her to work more hours than what was a fair exchange for her room and board.

Mrs Bracamonte allegedly also tried to make Stretton sign a letter as part of a final warning letter, in which she would agree to do more chores, including steam cleaning the floors once a week.

'She kept asking me and pressuring me ... the issue was 
they just thought that they could have me 24/7,' Stretton said.

She told ABC that under the terms of the original contract, either party had to give 30 days' notice to terminate the agreement.

Under that, she claimed, she was entitled to stay in the property and have full use of its amenities.

Stretton added that because the family brought the media in, it was making it hard for her to slowly being the process of moving out. She said she hadn't wanted their situation to become a 'spectacle'.

The couple who took Stretton in to their home told 20/20 that initially she had been a welcome addition the family.

'She was absolutely part of our family. And then she changed,' Mr Bracamonte said, as the couple claimed that after a few weeks Stretton had refused to work and just stayed in her room demanding meals.

Under California law, the couple were unable to remove Stretton immediately - a situation which they say has put stress on their marriage, and has worried their three children.
