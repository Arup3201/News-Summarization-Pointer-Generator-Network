Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has tipped striker Robin van Persie to be back to his best when his side meet Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

The Red Devils boss is adamant his compatriot will regain his confidence in front of goal, and claims the 31-year-old is still at the top of his game despite a drop in form.

'He has showed that at the World Cup and is showing that now, except for scoring goals. But that is only a matter of time,' Van Gaal told The Sun.

Striker Van Persie has hit a poor run of form in the Premier League this season but Van Gaal remains confident

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says Van Gaal has 'been a little bit unlucky' so far this season

'A striker also needs a bit of luck and then the confidence is higher.

'But he's self-confident, so I expect he shall score and maybe against Chelsea.

'Now he is more fit than ever and playing better but doesn't score as much.

'He's been a little bit unlucky, like against West Brom when he shot with his right foot - it was hard to believe that shot stayed out of the goal.' 

United play host to Chelsea in Sunday's hotly anticipated clash at Old Trafford, with the Red Devils currently 10 points adrift of The Blues at the peak of the table.
