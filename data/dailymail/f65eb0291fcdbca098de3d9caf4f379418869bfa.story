While shoppers across the country swarm stores to get their hands on cut-price electronics, the residents of Colorado are lining blocks to score deals on weed - in what retailers have dubbed 'Green Friday'.

Many marijuana dispensaries across the state - where recreational weed was legalized in January - are employing tactics more often seen during 'Black Friday'.

Among the deals were $50 ounces of marijuana that usually cost $250, USA Today reported, while another store  was selling Sweetgrass Kitchen's single-serving pumpkin pies laced with weed.

Grass Station in Denver sold 60 joints for $1 each - instead of the usual $7 - to the first people through the door on Friday morning, when lines queued around the block.

Owners said they were surprised by the interest in deals, expecting that customers would visit their stores after snagging deals at more traditional retailers.

'We were expecting a very quiet day, but when everyone else jumped on it, we definitely didn't want to be left behind,' Ryan Pratt, manager of Boulder's Helping Hands Herbals, told USA Today.

But others said they understood the need for marijuana over the Thanksgiving weekend. 

'It's a pretty stressful event, and some people might need a little relaxation afterward,' said Maka Kala'i of Organic Alternatives in Fort Collins.

John Satterfield, a distribution worker at Denver's Kindman Premium Cannabis, told Slate that some of their discounts would be for 80 or 90 per cent off, while others would be reserved for the first handful of customers through the door.

The Dixie Elixir Marijuana Company in Denver is also preparing holiday specials, including white chocolate peppermint squares, while another dispensary is selling pot in the shape of mini Christmas trees, CBS reported.

Since it became legalized on January 1, marijuana has generated more than $50 million in taxes and fees for the state.

But - unlike traditional retailers - the dispensaries did not advertize their 'Green Friday' deals on TV or billboards because of strict regulations to ensure marijuana is not marketed to anyone under 21.

Some critics were not happy about the retailers' new ploy to get customers through the door. 

'Dumping high levels of THC into pumpkin pies, sweet potatoes, hot chocolate and marshmallows, it is just perpetuating this false myth that marijuana is not dangerous,' Diane Carlson, co-founder of anti-legalization campaign group Smart Colorado, told USA Today.
