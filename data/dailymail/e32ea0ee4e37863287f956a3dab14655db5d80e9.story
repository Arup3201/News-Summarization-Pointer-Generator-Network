If your budget won’t stretch to a brand new Bentley, you can now at least smell like one for a fraction of the price.

The British car-maker has launched a range of fragrances for men – including a limited edition bottle which will cost £3,000.

Bentley bosses say the perfume collection captures the ‘essence’ of their powerful supercars – with hints of leather and wood rather than engine oil and unleaded.

The Crystal Edition scent comes in a crystal bottle shaped like the Bentley Flying B and costs £3,000

The perfume is a snip of the price of a £225,000 Bentley Mulsanne

Old-school ‘Bentley Boys’ who turn up their noses at such commercialism may be tempted to call it  Eau de Crewe – after the northern town where the car-maker is based.

Others may think the idea has more than a whiff of their Premier League football star customers about it.

The bespoke Lalique for Bentley Crystal Edition –  in a 40cl crystal bottle shaped like the legendary ‘Flying B’ Bentley mascot – carries a £3,000 price tag.

But that’s still a fraction of the cost of the £225,000 Bentley Mulsanne, or the more modestly priced £124,000 Continental GT Coupe.

Bentley says its collaboration with French crystal maker Lalique and its owner Art & Fragrance showcases the finest glassmaking expertise and is limited to only 999 pieces, available at ‘carefully selected retailers’ from April.

The car-maker notes: ‘Finely wrought in gleaming crystal, the dynamic styling of its wings epitomises timeless beauty.’

The eau de parfum itself was created by Mylène Alran from the French perfume house Robertet.

Bentley said:’It is a fitting elixir of fine woody notes and exquisite leather to complement the epicentres of excellence within Bentley’s craftsmanship.

‘Precious orris butter accord enriches the scent to create a sensual and charismatic character. ‘

Silvio Denz, chief executive of Lalique said: ’Bentley and Lalique have a similar history.

'Both companies were founded almost 100 years ago. Both stand for craftsmanship and tradition, but also for luxury, lifestyle and innovation.

'To create a fragrance together is to capture the essence of our skills and our vision in a bottle.’

Bentley designer Daniele Ceccomor said: ’The crystal edition is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, reflecting the unrivalled luxury and elegant values of both Bentley and Lalique.

‘Just as the Flying B sits gracefully on the front of our flagship Mulsanne model, we wanted to communicate the same importance with the preciousness of the crystal artwork and the uniqueness of the essence treasured by its delicate flacon.'

The limited fragrance, with only 999 bottles being produced, is available from April

The firm – now owned by German car giant Volkswagen -  has also produced Bentley for Men and Bentley for Men Intense scents.

The eau de toilette will cost £43 for a 60 ml bottle and £59.50 for 100 ml.

The  Intense eau de parfum costs £69.50 for 100 ml. There is also an aftershave balm at £32 and Hair & Body Shampoo at £24.

These fragrances have been created by Nathalie Lorson, from the perfume house Firmenich, and include hints of black pepper, musk, rum, bay leaves and cinnamon.

Bentley said: ’[Lorson] has skilfully transformed the quintessence of the luxury automotive brand Bentley into a superb and unmistakeable fragrance experience.

'To do so, the finest perfume raw ingredients have been used, including those must-haves for Bentley’s debut fragrance, fine wood and leather notes.’

Lorson said: ‘I chose cedar because of its powerful unadulterated scent and patchouli for its sensual depth and natural elegance.

'The ‘Intense’ version will take these notes to another level by infusing the rich scent with aromatic African geranium.'

She added: ’The bottle design echoes the luxury of the cars with an elegant symmetrical shape, striking appeal and a knurled ring around the top.’

These fragrances will also be available at selected perfumeries and department stores from April.
