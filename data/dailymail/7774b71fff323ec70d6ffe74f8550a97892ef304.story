A teenager will have to pay almost £900 in fines and costs after playing a James Blunt song too loudly – even though she claims to hate his music.

Council environmental health officers heard Rebecca Hope, 19, blasting out the British singer’s 2004 hit You’re Beautiful in her first-floor flat.

Another officer visited eight days later and heard her loudly playing the 1998 number one C’est La Vie by Irish girl band B*Witched, a court heard.

Hope was found guilty in her absence of four offences of breaching a noise abatement notice at her council home in Ipswich in March and April. It was imposed by Ipswich Borough Council in February after neighbours complained about noise from her flat.

South East Suffolk magistrates fined Hope £500 and ordered her to pay £374 costs and a £20 surcharge from her benefits.

But yesterday she denied that she was responsible for playing James Blunt and B*Witched, claiming it must have been one of her neighbours.

‘I hate the sound of James Blunt – so why would I listen to him,’ said Hope. 

‘I am in to much more modern music. My mum likes James Blunt and the last time I heard one of his songs was when she was listening to it at her home in Devon.

‘I don’t know anything about B*Witched and I haven’t even got any of their music.’

A council spokesman said: 'The council is here to help residents who are upset by loud noise.

'We will take action if necessary and will not tolerate noise nuisance that blights people’s lives.'
