PC sales have have gone into freefall with a 14 per cent drop last year - the biggest slump in history.

HP, the world's largest PC maker, saw the sharpest decline with 24 per cent fewer machines sold in 2012 compared to 2011.

Dell also saw an 11 per cent slump and even Apple, which saw a seven per cent fall, was unable to buck the trend.

Research firm IDC said it was the biggest decline overall since it began began tracking this data in 1994.

Analysts said that ‘the days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’ and that in the future we would all be using portable devices.

Even the launch of Windows 8 failed to stop the trend with some saying the negative response to the software may have exacerbated the trend.

PC makers have in recent years tried a string of innovations to breathe life into the market including Ultrabooks which were poorly received.

Experts say the success of the iPad and smartphone has led to the slump in PC sales, with people preferring gadgets they can carry with them

Windows 8 was also criticised for making too many changes and getting rid of the iconic start button.

The figures show that the late Apple founder Steve Jobs’ prediction that we are headed for a ‘post-PC era’ is coming true.

Bob O’Donnell, program vice president for clients and displays at IDC, said that what he called the ‘radical changes’ made to the PC in recent years had done it more harm than good.

He said: ‘At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market.

‘Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market’.

Microsoft also came under fire for the slump, with critics saying its Windows 8 software confused users

Some 350 million personal computers are sold each year, but the numbers are nothing compared to more portable options.

Some 919 million smartphones will be sold this year and 200 million tablets, taking their total comfortably over one billion.

Research firm Gartner also released similar figures which showed a 11 per cent decline in PC sales, the biggest drop since 2001.

The company has already predicted that by 2017 the main operating system for all computing devices will be Google’s Android.

Marcus Jewell of tech company Brocade said: ‘The days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’.
