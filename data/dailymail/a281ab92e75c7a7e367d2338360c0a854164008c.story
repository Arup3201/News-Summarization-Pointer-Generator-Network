The heatwave is now covering a million square miles and affecting 141 million Americans as the temperatures stayed above the 100 degree mark yesterday.

However forecasters say the heat will begin to ease today, but will remain in the 90s.

'Monday is really when we see cooler air coming,' said National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Pollin, with forecast temperatures sinking to the lower to middle 80s.

Scorching: The United States is suffering from a heatwave that is moving across the country

The bubble of hot air developed over 
the Midwest earlier this week and has caused more than a dozen deaths as
it moved eastward.

As of Saturday, the medical 
examiner's office in Chicago listed heat stress or heat stroke as the 
cause of death for eight people. The latest death, involved a 
59-year-old man.

New York's Manhattan experienced the hottest ever July 22 recorded, with an overwhelming 104-degree temperature in Central Park.

The
Washington DC region continued to be smothered in heat and humidity 
with temperatures reaching 102 degrees but with a heat index of more 
than 120 - hotter than Death Valley at daybreak.

In Newark, New Jersey, temperatures 
peaked at 108F, the highest ever recorded since records began in 1931 and
the hottest reported by the National Weather Service on the east coast.

In Oklahoma city, residents experienced the 27th straight day of triple-figure temperatures and in 
Maryland, the mercury hit 108F.

Triple-digit temperatures were also recorded 
in Islip, Long Island, which is usually cooled by Atlantic breezes, 
Philadelphia, Allentown and Reading in Pennsylvania, Georgetown in 
Delaware, Boston, Massachusetts, the East Coast gambling mecca of 
Atlantic City in New Jersey, and Baltimore in Maryland.

Even Bangor, Maine, which lies at the same latitude as Montreal in 
Canada, reached a record for the calendar day of 97F.

'Bullseyes of high heat and humidity' 
were affecting the central states and most of the East Coast, said Chris
Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather Service.

Severe storm and excessive heat warnings
were put in place for Saturday evening and forecasters said to expect the 
same for Sunday.

Overnight rains dumped nearly seven inches of water on Chicago on Saturday, offering some respite from the heat but causing parts of highways and train lines to shut down.

The rainfall measured at O'Hare International Airport beat all Chicago records for the wettest calendar day, at 6.91 inches, over the last record of 6.64 inches in September 13, 2008, according to ChicagoWeatherCenter.com.

More rain is on the way in late Satruday afternoon, according to forecasters.

And as the nation seeks solace in the cool indoors, power companies struggle to cope with the high demand.

In New York by mid afternoon, Con Ed 
recorded a peak of 13,182 megawatts, surpassing the previous record, 
with demand expected to increase as the scorching weather continues 
throughout the day.

A Con Ed spokesman said they even expected to set a new record every hour as the heat index was set to peak between 4pm and 7pm.

More than 10,000 people were without power on Friday afternoon with more outages expected.

The typical temperature for this time of year is 85 degrees and Mayor Bloomberg congratulated Con Ed on doing a good job.

He said: 'Con Ed's done a great job 
so far. We think this will be the most stressful day on the electric 
grid in recent history - maybe ever.'

The National Weather Service issued 
excessive heat warnings on Saturday for a huge section of the country from Kansas to
Maine, forecasting temperatures near or at triple digits today and into
the weekend.

The heatwave has so far claimed at 
least 24 lives as it stretches into its eighth day, and energy firms 
are warning parts of the country could face rolling blackouts as they 
struggle to keep up with demand.

Forecasters said the high temperatures and stifling  humidity - with barely a breath of wind - will force up the heat indexes.

But
New Yorkers hoping to beat the heat were thwarted by warnings urging 
them to avoid city waterways after a wastewater treatment plant disabled by fire began spewing millions of gallons of raw sewage into the Hudson River.

Officials
cautioned against swimming and bathing at Staten Island's South Beach, 
Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach, and Brooklyn's Sea Gate beach, 
especially for people with medical conditions.

Five hundred City 500 cooling centres have been opened across the five boroughs of New York, to allow
residents without air conditioning to escape the stifling temperatures.
They also warned elderly people and anybody with health problems to 
keep out of the heat.

Yesterday
it was so hot subway countdown clocks were turned off as officials 
expected temperatures in underground equipment rooms to reach 120F, 
which could damage equipment.

Across the country, emergency room 
visits are soaring, according to public health officials, mainly because
of people suffering from heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

At
least six more fatalities were reported yesterday, including a Michigan
restaurant cook who suffered a heart attack after being sent home from 
his job and a teenage boy who drowned while swimming at summer camp in 
the same state.

In 
Pittsburgh, a man was stuck on a roof for almost two hours because the 
hot tar he'd been using stopped him from climbing to safety.

AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski
told the New York Post the high temperatures are likely to linger until
Sunday, because of an unusual high-pressure system acting like a heat 
dome.

He said: 'You have high pressure at most levels of the atmosphere. Not only is it warm at the 
surface, it's also warm upstairs [in the upper atmosphere]. That creates
a very stable atmosphere.'

The
National Weather Service issued excessive heat warnings across the 
Midwest and East Coast, forecasting the heat index could reach up to 
115 degrees on Saturday.
