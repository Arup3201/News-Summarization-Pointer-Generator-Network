Manchester United striker Robin van Persie left the Liberty Stadium on crutches and with his right leg in a protective boot to pile more misery on Louis van Gaal. 

The Dutchman, who started the match alongside Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney, hobbled out of Swansea's stadium after appearing to injure his right leg. 

Van Persie and his team-mates were unable to stop Swansea from sealing a Premier League double over Manchester United as Ki Sung-yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis struck to hand the home side all three points.

Ander Herrera had put his side in the lead in the 28th minute, however the Spaniard's opener was quickly cancelled out by Ki Sung-yueng.

The extent of Van Persie's injury is not yet known, however Van Gaal did say his fellow countryman 'could not run anymore'. 

‘We dominated the game even with 10 men because Robin van Persie could not run anymore because of an injury (after United had made their last substitution),' said Van Gaal.

The Red Devils boss will be hoping Van Persie's injury is not too serious as his side face a battle to claim a spot in next season's Champions League and face Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on March 9.
