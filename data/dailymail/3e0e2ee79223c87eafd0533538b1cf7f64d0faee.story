A bride stunned her wedding guests by allowing her husband to shave off all her hair in aid of Cancer Research just an hour after tying the knot.

Roxy Greaves, 31, and her husband Mick, 30, decided to make a statement on their wedding day in Sheffield to raise money for the charity.

The couple who live in Swallownest in Yorkshire, have both lost relatives to the disease.

Just an hour after tying the knot, Mick Greaves shaved off all of his new wife's hair to raise money for Cancer Research

The couple have raised almost £1,300 for Cancer Research UK after setting up an online donation page

Just an hour after saying 'I do', Mr Greaves took a razor to his new wife's head in front of 80 stunned guests.

Mother-of-two, Roxy said: 'I always wanted to shave my head for cancer research since I was 16, but I was certain that it should be on a memorable day.

'I thought about it for a long time, but earlier this year I said 'that's it - I'm doing it on my wedding day'.

'I told Mick and asked whether it was alright with him. He said there was only one condition - that I had hair for our wedding vows.

'Mick said he prefers me with long hair, but I'm beautiful in his eyes and I can do whatever I like.'

The couple met on an online dating site in 2010. After chatting for several months, Roxy, originally from Selkirk in the Scottish Borders, invited Mick to visit her.

Mrs Greaves wrote ahead of the wedding: 'My
self and my future husband have both suffered the loss of a loved one 
due to cancer and this is just a little about what they meant to us and 
the memories they left.

'We are just glad that we can help 
future research get closer to finding a cure so that other people can 
get more time with their loved ones.'

The amount of money raised is more than double what the bride had set as a target.

Speaking of his wife, Mr Greaves, who works as a chef, said: 'She's the love of my life.

'I wasn't happy when Roxy told me she wanted to shave her hair off, but it's something she always wanted to do.

died from stomach cancer.

'Our wedding was wonderful and every moment was special. The ceremony was amazing.

'Mick
wanted to have the first shot and he shaved the first few strips from 
my head, but then my hairdresser came to help, because she was 
quicker.', Mrs Greaves added.

'During the head shave everyone watched cheering and clapping. About an hour after we said our wedding vows my hair was gone.

'Over the evening everyone commented on how much it suited me and how proud they were of me.

'I enjoy having short hair. It means I 
can get out of the house quicker and I'm also saving money on shampoo 
and hairdressing salons.

'We are just glad that we can help future research get closer to finding a cure, so that other people can get more time with their loved ones.

'Unfortunately I could not convince my daughter to shave her hair as well.'
