Allyson Ng was jailed for fraudulently helping learner drivers pass their theory test

A Chinese interpreter was jailed today for helping more than 100 learner drivers cheat on their theory tests.

Allyson Ng, 45, charged £110 to get Mandarin speakers through the written part of the UK driving test.

A court heard Ng was cheating by telling candidates when to use 'dui' the Mandarin word for 'yes' on multiple choice questions.

But bosses at the Driving Standards Agency became suspicious of the number of Chinese learners queuing up to hire Ng for their theory tests.

She was arrested at Cardiff theory test centre on 18 October 2012.

An investigation team analysed a random sample of 27 recordings of Ng’s translations and found they were all fraudulent.

And the agency believes some candidates never bothered to learn the Highway Code because they knew Ng would get them through.

Ng, of Cardiff, admitted making 27 fraudulent translations and asked for another 40 offences to be taken into account.

She was jailed for 12 months at Cardiff Crown Court.

DSA chiefs said it was in the process of tracing 94 people who used Ng to pass their theory test at a centre in the Welsh capital.

They will have their test pass certificates revoked and will have to sit their entire driving test again.

The DSA’s head of fraud and integrity, Andy Rice, said: 'The driving test is there to ensure that all drivers have the skills and knowledge to use the roads safely and responsibly.

'Anyone who tries to circumvent this process is putting innocent road-users at risk.

'This sentence sends a clear message that driving test fraud is a serious offence and will be dealt with accordingly.'

The theory test which costs £31 is a series of multiple choice questions on a computer screen at an official driving test centre.

The interpreter charged £110 to help Mandarin speakers pass the £31 theory test

Under current legislation learners whose first language isn’t English can use an interpreter on both the theory and practical driving tests.

Theory tests candidates can choose from an approved list of interpreters compiled by the DSA.

The candidate pays for the interpreter - who can charge as much as they like for their services.

To become an approved by the DSA interpreter’s must have a qualification
 from a recognised body and attach two references to their application.

After their qualifications and references have been checked and approved they are free to charge candidates for their services.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said drivers must have the correct skills before taking to the road

DSA spokesman Stephen Small said interpreter fraud was a 'serious problem'.

He said: 'There are a relatively small number of tests conducted with interpreters.

'When you look at the overall figures it is a serious problem but not widespread.

'This is the third conviction in as many years of interpreter fraud.'

Earlier this year the Government launched a consultation on proposals to withdraw foreign language support for driving test candidates.

This was in response to concerns about potential road safety implications and the risk of fraud.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: 'We want to ensure that all drivers have the right skills to use our roads safely and responsibly.

'We also want to keep test fees to a minimum for candidates, and I am not convinced that providing translations is the most effective use of resources.

'There is a potential road safety risk of drivers not understanding important traffic updates or emergency information.

'Allowing interpreters on tests also presents the risk of fraud, for example if they are indicating the correct answers to theory test questions.'

The Government’s response to the consultation is expected in the autumn.
