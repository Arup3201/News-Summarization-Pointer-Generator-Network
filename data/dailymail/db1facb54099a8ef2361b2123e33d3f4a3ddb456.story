A multi-millionaire businessman was today ‘designated’ the father of the love child of France’s first ever female justice minister.

A court in Versailles, west of Paris, handed down the ruling after considering evidence that Dominique Desseigne, 70, fathered a four-year-old child, with Rachida Dati, 48.

The glamorous politician remains a Paris mayor and MEP after serving as justice minister for two years up until 2009.

She was linked with up to eight boyfriends at around the time she was seeing Mr Desseigne – a revelation which emerged during their bitter paternity row.

Mr Desseigne, head of casino group Groupe Lucien Barriere, refused to take a DNA test after being accused of being Zohra’s father.

Mr Desseigne last year told M, Le Monde’s magazine, that he was one of many who had an 'adventure' with Ms Dati, and that he 'does not know' if he is Zohra's father.

Moreover, his lawyers suggested in written evidence that she was involved in 'up to eight relationships' at the time.

These included 'a TV host, a minister, a chief executive office, a Spanish prime minister, a brother of Nicolas Sarkozy, a Qatari Attorney General and the heir to a luxury goods empire,' said the M article, published in 2012.

Mr Desseigne refused an application made by Ms Dati at a court in Versailles, near Paris, to submit to a DNA test.

According to French law, anybody approached for a test can say no, although Ms Dati was said to have other proof, including sworn statements from her staff that Mr Desseigne constantly visited 'their' child soon after she was born.

According to Le Parisien newspaper and Itele news channel, Mr Dessiegne has now been ‘designated’ the father. 

Rachida Dati will now receive more than £2,000 a month in child maintenance from Mr Desseigne 

He is set to appeal the decision, the news outlets claims.It means he will have to pay up to £2,000 a month in child maintenance, although the figure is likely to end up being a let more, given his massive wealth.

Those suspected of being the child's father in the past have included a range of public figures, ranging from former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Anzar to former French president Mr Sarkozy.

Ms Dati, a notorious self-publicist, encouraged the speculation in a range of interviews in magazines like Paris Match, in which she also appeared in glamorous photo shoots.Ms Dati, who comes from a North African immigrant background and who has one failed marriage behind her, has been single since her early 20s.

Mr Desseigne is believed to be worth more than £500 million due to his hotel and casino holdings 

She became the star of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ethnically diverse 'rainbow cabinet' in 2007 in an attempt to get minorities into government, but was unceremoniously sacked in 2009 when it was claimed she was not up to the job.

Mr Desseigne, who is worth more than £500 million, was a close business ally of the Mr Sarkozy. The former president famously celebrated his election win in Le Fouquet's, a chic restaurant on the Champs Elysee which Mr Desseigne owns.

Mr Desseigne has two grown up children from his marriage to his late wife Diane Barriere-Desseigne, who died in 2001. Neither Ms Dati nor Mr Desseigne were immediately available for comment.
