Computer giant Dell is facing angry complaints from customers claiming their new laptop smells like cat urine.

Dozens of users of the £900 Latitude 6430u Ultrabook device say it whiffs of feline wee.

The issue with the high-end business laptop was first noted in June when one user posted on the company's forum asking for help.

A bit smelly: Dozens of users of Dell's Latitude 6430u Ultrabook device say it whiffs of feline wee. The problem with the high-end business computer was first noted in June

Since then, dozens of angry customers have written about the terrible smell their laptops have emitted.

One wrote: 'No amount of compressed air is going to help the awful stench coming from the keyboard.'

Another user added: 'I thought for sure one of my cats sprayed it, but there was something faulty with it so I had it replaced.'

Dell is investigating and claims the problem is an issue with the manufacturing process and not the result of contamination.

A spokesman said: 'The smell is not related to cat urine or any other type of biological contaminant, nor is it a health hazard.

'The problem was related to the manufacturing process, and has now been resolved.'

Dell has changed the manufacturing process for the machine and is telling users to send affected laptops away for the keyboard and palm rest to be replaced free of charge.

The Windows 8 Pro Ultrabook has otherwise received positive reviews and claims to be 'thin, lightweight and beautifully designed.'

An advert for the computer on Dell's website, says: 'Manage your workload with a cutting-edge laptop that’s as thoughtfully designed on the outside as it is on the inside.'

The laptop has an environmentally conscious design that is energy-efficient and free of PVC material.

Dell said the manufacturing process was to blame for the smell coming from the Ultrabook, pictured, but the issue has now been resolved
