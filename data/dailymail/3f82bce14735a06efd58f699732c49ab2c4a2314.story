Last year, Dennis Rodman sang him a bizarre rendition of happy birthday as adoring crowds clapped in unison during a basketball game in Pyongyang.

With the former basketball star out of town, Korean dictator Kim Jong-un will have to settle for his usual entourage of fawning and fearful officials as he celebrates another year.

January 8 is said to be Kim's official birthday - though his exact age remains a closely-guarded secret - like many of the details surrounding the dictator's reign.

Still, the date could be the cue for another peculiar photo to appear of the dictator who has been been photographed countless times in a variety of strange situations since taking power in 2011.

Dramatic: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured on board a submarine as he inspected a navy unit stationed on the east coast of the country last June

Kim was recently pictured delivering his annual New Year speech in Pyongyang - with severely over-plucked eyebrows.

Comparisons with earlier photos suggests the North Korean leader has defied the Cara Delevingne trend - opting instead for far shorter and less prominent brows.

In November 2014 Kim was left looking silly when a pair of cuddly toys appearing to have sex 'photobombed' his picture at an orphanage.

As he leant against a bed, he seemed oblivious to the two soft toys placed in a compromising position on a wardrobe in the corner of the room.

A series of photographs that circulated around the world last June showed the leader apparently teaching a submarine crew drills and tutoring the vessel's captain on  how to navigate as he visited a navy unit.

Dramatic pictures released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, showed the despot rising from the lookout tower of the submarine and later looking intently through the vessel's periscope.

The paper said Kim called for the crew on the submarine to 'devote their wisdom and enthusiasm to rounding off the combat preparations'. 

Last year, Kim was not seen in public for five weeks - with some analysts speculating that a military coup had taken place.

Other rumours had the dictator suffering from gout - after experts analysed his limping gait in video clips taken during a public outing.

It was claimed Kim had been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland.

Such theories were inflamed by older images of the leader inspecting food factories up and down the secretive country.

In one picture the despot was shown sitting in a chair while advising officials on the best practice in the running of such a factory.

Kim has formed a close friendship with former NBA star Dennis Rodman and the pair have spent a considerable amount of time together - with Rodman even belting out happy birthday at an official gathering this time last year.

The ex-basketball player also posed for a group photo with Kim and other former NBA players at the Pyongyang Gymnasium in January 2014.

In 2012, Kim sparked rumours that he had hired Vladimir Putin's PR team after images were released of him riding a horse as he inspected an army training ground in an undisclosed part of the country.  

Showing his thrill-seeking side once more, Kim was also captured taking a ride on a roller-coaster at a theme park in the country's capital in 2012.

He has been snapped in the cockpit of a plane on at least a couple of occasions. This month he supposedly flew a plane for a North Korean TV documentary.

He was earlier seen squeezed into the cockpit of a fighter jet in October as officers taught him the controls.

Kim was famously pictured taking a lonely ride on a chairlift at a purpose-built ski resort in 2013.

The communist enclave's one and only ski destination, on top of Taehwa Peak, boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes. 

Other snaps of Kim include his trip to a mushroom farm and his visit to an aquarium - where he was pictured excitedly stroking a model octopus' tentacle.

On countless occasions the leader has been seen surrounded by sobbing and delirious-looking citizens during public outings.

One notable shot shows Kim flanked by a crowd of weeping members of the Korean Children's Union in 2012 - with the leader wearing a Scout-style scarf around his neck.

Compared to his predecessors, Kim's birthday celebrations since he took power following the death of his father have been fairly low key.

The birthday of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the country, is considered the Day of the Sun and falls on April 15. 

Kim's father, Kim Jong Il had a birthday on February 16 - which is known as the Day of the Shining Star in North Korea.

'There's a lot of speculation why that's the case,' Lee Jung Hoon, professor of international relations at Yonsei University in South Korea, told CNN.

'Kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy, that he's not extravagant. Then there's sort of negative take on this issue, as to he's still very young, 29, 30 or 31. 

'When you start marking his birthday, then the whole North Korean people will start to wonder, then what's his age?'

The Unification Ministry records Kim's birthday as January 8 - but the exact year of birth is marked as 1982, 1983 or 1984.

In Kim's three years in power, he's followed the legacies of his father and grandfather in his attitude towards the outside world.

A South Korean report released this week indicated that North Korea could be closer to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead indicating that Kim has continued focusing on nuclear weapons.

And his regime has also been marked by the purge of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was executed as a traitor in December 2013 - with some suggesting he was thrown to a pit of starving dogs.
