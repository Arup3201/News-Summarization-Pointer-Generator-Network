A 29-year-old Brooklyn woman has fallen to her death after trying to climb into her boyfriend's fourth floor window following an argument early Friday morning.

Hannah Shaw was found unresponsive outside her boyfriend Alex Douglas' apartment building at 409 Kent Avenue in Williamsburg around 4:40am.

Shaw and Douglas, 42, had reportedly been arguing at a local bar before the tragic accident, and he left the venue without her.

Shaw, who worked at landscaping company Jungle Design NYC, turned up at the apartment, but Douglas refused to let her in.

The Maine native then climbed the fire escape onto the building's roof in an attempt to enter the apartment through the window, only to find it locked.

At some stage, Shaw lost her footing and fell to her death.

According to the New York Post, Shaw, Douglas and friends had been drinking at the Lucky Dog on Bedford Ave all evening before the couple began arguing.

Douglas and friends returned to his apartment, locking Shaw out of the house.

'He locked her out. She went up to the roof and fell off,' a source told the New York Post.

Emergency services arrived on the scene but were unable to revive Shaw.

She was rushed to Woodhull Hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Shaw's Facebook page says she was a graduate of Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachussetts.

She was a fashion-lover and designed her own dresses and jewelry.

Shaw lived a few blocks away from Douglas, her boyfriend of about a year, reports the Post.  

Police are awaiting toxicology reports to determine whether Shaw was drunk at the time of her fall.
