‘You can’t trust people whose cuisine is so bad,’ joked the then French President Jacques Chirac in his infamous put-down of the British with other world leaders.

The Gaullist leader generated headlines around the world after being caught ridiculing English gastronomy alongside other world leaders at a summit in 2005.

Mr Chirac said: ‘The only thing they have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow disease. After Finland, it is the country with the worst food.’

But 10 years on, exports of the most British of British delicacies – the greasy fry up – are rocketing, according to new figures.

Exports of the most British of British delicacies – the greasy fry up – are rocketing, according to new figures

British bacon is now being exported around the world - including to Denmark – with exports of sausages, eggs and even black pudding soaring.

In 2013 British bacon producers exported over £33million worth of the sandwich staple to nearly 70 countries, with another £1.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway.

British eggs, meanwhile, are worth nearly £88million to the British economy – with exports to 57 countries in 2013.

Sales of bakes beans, smoked kippers and British jams are also booming, Government figures show.

From 2010 to 2013 exports of baked beans to Saudi Arabia have increased by 46 per cent, while exports of bread have risen by 131 per cent. In 2013 we exported nearly £25m of baked beans to 92 countries.

Smoked kipper - the traditional Victorian breakfast - is showing signs of a comeback, with exports to 14 countries last year, bringing in £724,000 to the economy.

Jam to Jamaica

Overall, the UK sent £94million of jam around the world in 2013, from Japan to Jamaica – with over £8million going to France.

Peanut butter to Pakistan

In the last two years we exported £251,000 of peanut butter to Pakistan – with £8.6m exported in 2013.

Honey to New Zealand

New Zealand’s Manuka honey may be renowned the world over, but they still want to import our UK natural honey, with a 162% increase in exports to New Zealand from 2010-2013.

We exported UK natural honey to 64 countries in 2013, worth £13m.

Porridge to the Middle East

The traditional winter breakfast is gaining popularity… in the Middle East, minister said. In 2013 we exported £578,000 to 32 countries, including growing amounts to the United Arab Emirates.

Since 2010, 600 new markets for food businesses have been opened up.

In 2013 exports of UK food and drink were worth £18.9 billion, an increase of £1.2 billion since 2010.

Exports of our fruit and vegetable juices have also rocketed – up almost 40 per cent since 2010 to a total of £65 million in 2013.

Apple and orange juice are among our biggest international sellers with £35 million in sales. British juices are now shipped to 96 countries including fruit havens Spain, Italy, Brazil and America.

The demand for our fruit and vegetable drinks has soared by almost 40 per cent since 2010 making the UK the fourth biggest juice exporter in the EU. 

A spokeswoman in the Environment Department claimed ‘the Danes can’t get enough of our streaky bacon’, adding: ‘Our black pudding is enjoyed from Spain to Norway, our eggs are boiled in Brazil and our baked beans are the toast of Saudi Arabia.’

She added: ‘Our natural honey exports to New Zealand have trebled over three years and the Italians are hooked on our kippers.’

Ministers said the figures show Britain is now ‘leading the way in exporting the foods eaten around the world for the most important meal of the day – breakfast’.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: ‘Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and no-one does breakfast like the British.

‘Our traditional full English breakfasts are legendary, and people all around the world are buying our top-quality UK produce to make their own fry-ups—from premium pork sausages to quality British eggs.'

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said British breakfasts were 'legendary'

She added: ‘From old favourites like porridge oats to more modern products like granola our unique strength lies in the combination of innovation and tradition that makes our food and drink so popular the world over.

‘We’re opening new international markets every week to help a record number of home-grown food and drinks companies sell their delicious produce abroad, providing more jobs and generating millions for our growing economy.’

Food manufacturing is larger than car production and aerospace combined, and one in eight people are employed in the UK food chain. 

Westaway Sausages

West country sausage producers Westaways produce 250,000 sausages every day, and export them around the world—currently about 5 per cent of their sausages are destined for foreign shores, but this figure is rising every day.

This week alone, sausages were sent to Portugal, Malta, Hong Kong, Bermuda and Barbados.

Lizi’s Granola

For the health conscious, new and innovative businesses like Lizi’s Granola are selling their low-sugar and low-fat alternatives to the fry-up worldwide.

Based in Cardiff, Lizi’s launched ten years ago and now exports to all continents other than South America.

Three years ago Lizi’s began exporting to China, where the expanding middle class means healthy eating trends are on the up.

Daioni 

Daioni—which means ‘goodness’ in Welsh—exports its organic milk and dairy products around the globe, as well as its flavoured milk drinks.

Daioni products are all made from organic milk from farms in England and Wales, and are exported to China, Hong Kong, The Middle East and Europe. Last year the business's exports grew by 500 per cent.
