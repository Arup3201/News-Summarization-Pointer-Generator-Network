A four-year-old who died from massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike allegedly lived on fast food and was surrounded by sex toys and drugs at her home, a court has heard.

During an inquest into Chloe Valentine's death, the Coroners Court was yesterday told by three people the girl sang 'I want a horny daddy' while they also heard her mother calling the child a 'c***', The Advertiser reports.

State Coroner Mark Johns is looking into the Families SA's management of more than 20 child abuse notifications about Chloe before she died in January 2012.

She had suffered fatal injuries after repeatedly crashing a motorbike over a three day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home.

On day 19 into the inquest today, a social worker gave evidence that she had struggled with her workload which had more severe cases than Chloe's in 2011.

Social worker Tara Liston gave evidence on Thursday and said Chloe's case wasn't as important compared to the others she was handling, the ABC reports.

Ms Liston told the court Chloe and her mother 'engaged really well'. 

'In comparison to other cases, when you read it, there were some things that Ashlee did well and there were other times that she didn't... it would be a case that was not as significant as other cases,' she said.

'It wasn't what we'd look at in middle class society and say 'it was okay' but in child protection... it appeared to myself to be okay.'

Other claims were previously made in court by three people - including Jay Rann who was the child's respite carer - who said Polkinghorne left sex toys and drugs around the house, called her daughter a 'c***' and also fed Chloe Hungry Jack's and spent her welfare money on herself.

The court also heard allegations that the bathrooms walls at Chloe's home was covered with 'dried faeces', according to The Advertiser.

They also claimed Chloe sang 'I want a horny daddy'.

Chloe's mother Ashlee Polkinghorne and Benjamin McPartland, who was her boyfriend at the time, are both serving jail sentences for the girl's manslaughter.

On December 1, social worker Katrina Heading told the inquest she considered removing Chloe when she was 16-months-old in November 2008 after her 'paralytic' mother Ashlee Polkinghorne left her with a 15-year-old friend while she drank at the beach.

Chloe's grandmother  agreed to take her but when an angry and abusive Polkinghorne finally surfaced, a supervisor decided Chloe should be returned to her mother.

Ms Heading said Chloe was sent home unsupervised with a private chauffeur because there were only two crisis care staff working that night.

She said the chauffeur company conducted police checks on its workers but Families SA did not have access to those checks.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned whether it was appropriate for a 16-month-old child to be left unsupervised with a private driver.

She asked why Ms Heading had not pushed harder to have Chloe removed, given Families SA had received multiple abuse notifications.

'You knew that this woman had left her child with a 15-year-old so that she could consume alcohol ... that's concern enough, isn't it?' she asked.

Ms Heading said she had backed her supervisor's judgement, despite having reservations about Polkinghorne.

'It took me by surprise but I had faith in my supervisor ... (to make) tough calls in tough situations,' she said.

'When you're caught up in the moment, you can get over-emotional.'

The inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect.

Government agency Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old.

After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne.

Polkinghorne, 22, and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced her to ride the motorbike over three days, which lead to the four year old's death who had massive head injuries.

Earlier in the inquest, evidence revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house.

One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food.

It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends.

In October, social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs.

Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months

Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 

Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home.

The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking.

Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, also told the inquest in October Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house.

Ms Stewart said she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. 

Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother.

But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships.

Ms Polkinghorne and Mr McPartland, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect.

The inquest continues.
