Curvy Simone Charles wants to be a role model for young girls - the kind she never had.

The size 18 student from London beat more than 5,000 entrants to win a social media modelling competition for plus size women.

Simone, 20, is now signed to Models 1 and will grace the August cover of plus size fashion magazine, SLiNK. She is also now the face and body of new luxury denim line 
Beauty in Curves.

Simone Charles' winning Instagram picture was 'great, and in person she had star quality too'

The competition required wannabe models to enter via uploading Instagram 'selfies' online and became the largest of it's kind, eclipsing 'straight' social media modelling comps as more than 5,000 girls size 12plus entered their pics.

At 5ft 10inches tall Simone she has a gorgeous hourglass figure (bust 44 waist 36 hips 43) and her bikini-clad selfie got the judge's attention immediately.

'This is an amazing opportunity for normal people to enter the modelling industry,' said Simone.

'I am celebrating my incredible win with my family. Everyone's really excited and appreciates what a big deal it is for me.

'I've done a little bit of amateur modelling in the 
past  for small scale fashion designers, and won a plus size modelling contest, Miss Curvaceous, in 2012.'

But her Models 1 win is her biggest break yet and Simone is preparing herself for what's to come.

'I have a few model friends who help me 
with questions I have about the industry and what to expect. Everyone's 
really supportive, and they remind me to not forget what I've come from.

'My dream is to be the face of clothing brand with a high reputation which is respected worldwide. Someone like Gucci or Prada.'

Simone is currently at university studying Psychology, the career she was planning before modelling came in to her life.

'It's something I enjoy - being a confident woman. I would like to be inspiration, someone people look up to.

'When
 I was growing up, social media wasn't as widespread, we didn't have as 
much access to bold, confident women who could inspire us to showcase 
our bodies and talents. Now you can follow curvy models on Instagram and
 feel inspired.

Simone stands 5ft 10inches tall and has a perfect hourglass figure (bust 44 waist 36 hips 43)

'When I was younger all I had was my school friends to compare myself to, and many of them are a lot smaller than me and that made me feel insecure.

'I admire plus size models such as Denise Bidot.

'Coco Rocha is also inspiring, and Tyra Banks in terms of her fierceness and ambition - she's so bold and sure of herself.'

'I'd like to be the woman I wish was around when I was younger. One who works with what she's got. She's curvaceous and not shy about it. I want to be like that for girls who don't have that. I'd love to be a role model.'

Simone is 'always on Instagram': 'I spend three hours a day scrolling through it. That's how I came accross the Models 1 contest. I follow them and saw they posted pictures about their Instagram model search so I applied.

'I used a picture taken while I was on holiday, I had a bit of a glow. It already had about 130 likes before I submitted it and I knew it was one of me best angles - I know how to work with that.'

Out of a record breaking 5,600 entries on Instagram, a panel of judges from Models 1, SLiNK Magazine and denim brand Beauty In Curves chose Simone Charles as the winner of this highly coveted contract.

Models 1 representative says: 'Simone's Instagram pictures were great but the moment she walked in we knew we had found someone special with real star quality'.

The final shortlist of 12 girls, all sporting killer curves, were invited into Models 1 HQ where they were all photographed and interviewed before the winner was chosen.

Runner up Lucinda Warby, a receptionist from Herefordshire (age 18 and UK size 16) was also offered a contract and two other finalists were invited into the agency for a further meeting.

Response to the competition was 
unprecedented, attracting over 3,000 more entries than the Models 1 
'straight size' model search last year. 

Rivkie
 Baum, Editor of SLiNK says: 'Having interviewed the finalists I was 
really impressed and touched by their passion to create more diversity 
within fashion and their understanding of the complexity of body image 
amongst women. Their personal struggles were inspiring.' 

Alice
 Dogruyol, Founder of Beauty in Curves says: 'When I created BC Jeans I 
had a body just like Simone's in mind, a beautifully curvy hourglass 
figure. I am thrilled to have found such a gorgeous woman and can't wait
 to shoot her wearing BC Jeans. The fashion and media industries have 
been dominated by one ideal for so long and it is time for more diverse 
body shapes to be admired. Thankfully there seems to be a really 
positive international shift in attitudes happening'.

Models
 1 representative says: 'There has never been a better time to be a 
curvy model. Demand for our curvy girls just keeps growing and it is not
 just the size 12, 14 and 16's that in are in demand, brands are looking
 for size 18 and 20 curves. We were so impressed by the calibre of girls
 that made it through to the final and we really look forward to 
developing Simone's modelling career'.
