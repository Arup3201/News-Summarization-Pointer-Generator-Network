A tinnitus sufferer whose problem was so bad that he was contemplating suicide has found his own cure - by emailing an expert 3,000 miles away in America.

Retired radio presenter, Ian Turner, was at the end of his tether because the 'agonising' tinnitus was causing a constant a loud 'whooshing' sound in his right ear.

Doctors in Britain diagnosed Ian's chronic condition - but said it was 'too dangerous' to try and operate on it.

However, Mr Turner refused to give up so tracked down an expert in New York and emailed his brain scans to him.

Dr Maxim Shapiro, from Langone Medical Center, New York, sent the scans back with a series of arrows drawn on them.

Mr Turner took Dr Shapiro's email to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and told doctors: 'This is how to cure me.'

After four operations Mr Turner has now made a full recovery.

He said: 'In desperation, I researched the condition on the internet and emailed the scans to Dr Shapiro.

'He emailed them back to me with lots of little arrows showing what was causing the whooshing problem.

'It wasn't as serious as the doctors here thought - and once they saw the arrows they knew how to fix it.

'My life has been transformed and I want to cross the Atlantic to look Dr Shapiro in the eye to thank him.'

Doctors in Britain diagnosed Mr Turner with objective pulsatile tinnitus - caused by an obstruction in the passage between the heart and brain.

Tinnitus is the name given to the sensation of sound in the absence of an external source.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rhythmical noise that usually has the same rate as the heart. It is caused by a change in blood flow in the vessels near the ear.

Mr Turner, of Llandudno, North 
Wales, said he had been told his local hospital was unable to treat him, as it did not offer such care. But if did refer him to Addenbrooke's.

He said: 'After the intervention and instructions from Dr Shapiro everything was different.

'I had four operations at Addenbrooke's - three of them in three days.

'Addenbrooke's were wonderful. I feel great.'

He said the noise in his ear was getting worse almost daily and unless it had been treated he would have attempted suicide.

Mr Turner is now working with Aberconwy MP, Guto Bebb, to raise awareness of the problem.

Mr Bebb said: 'I must compliment Ian's determination to send the scans to the U.S.

'There has been recognition that the second opinion he had from America hit the nail on the head.'

Around one in seven Britons has suffered
 from tinnitus, the medical name for hearing ringing, buzzing or 
whistling noises inside the head which have no external source.

The condition is thought to be triggered by over-active nerve cells within the hearing area of the brain.

Although
 there is no cure, therapies which use a generator to mask the ringing 
by creating a competing sound on a similar frequency – such as the sea –
 can relieve distress.

Cognitive behavioural therapy, in which 
patients are encouraged to discuss their problems, can also help 
patients to think differently about the condition and live with it 
long-term.

However, there is little evidence about which treatment works best.
