Families across the country flocked to parks, beaches and lakes today to make the most of the glorious Easter sunshine - with temperatures as high as 17C in the South of England.

Hundreds of parents and children spent the school holidays at beaches across Britain, where they could be seen eating ice cream, sunbathing and playing in the sea.

Others were spotted relaxing in the sunshine at Regent's Park in London - while some took to the water on pedalos and canoes in Birmingham and Derbyshire.

Rain could sweep in as the weekend progresses

And a number of families were captured walking across stepping stones over water at the picturesque Cambridge Botanic Gardens.

Met Office experts say the warm, dry 
weather is set to continue over the next few days - with temperatures as high as 19C in the south tomorrow.

But Britons are being urged to make the most of the spring sunshine as showers are expected on Easter Sunday and Monday, setting the tone for the rest of next week.

Spokesman Dan Williams said that 
while most of the country enjoyed balmy sunshine today, light rain was 
likely to fall tonight in northern and western parts of Scotland, before
 moving south through the night, meaning scattered showers for parts of 
northern England tomorrow.

Engaging with nature: But the spring sunshine will give way to showers on Easter Sunday and Monday. Above, a girl rides a canoe in Markeaton Park in Derby, Derbyshire

Striking: These showers will set the tone for the rest of next week, the Met Office said. Above, Suzanne Roberts (front) enjoys an ice cream at Markeaton Park in Derby

Easter spirit: Surrounded by sunshine, dandelions and baby chicks, Amelie Putt, four, gets into the Easter spirit at Highfields Happy Hens Farm in Etwall, Derbyshire

Warm start: Sheep grazing amongst the stones at Stonehenge in Wiltshire were bathed in a warm orange glow as the Easter sun rose this morning

Beautiful dawn: It was a similarly beautiful start to the day at Whitley Bay in Northumberland, as the sun rose behind St Mary's lighthouse, turning the blue sky orange

Better move the Easter egg hunt indoors: Tomorrow, Friday and Saturday are forecast to be mostly warm and sunny, but rain will fall on much of the country on Sunday

But
 he said most of the country would enjoy warm and sunny conditions 
tomorrow,  with London and the south east reaching temperatures of up to
 19C.

Mr Williams said: 
'There should be some good periods of sunshine tomorrow in southern 
areas, particularly along the south coast and in the south west, before 
it probably becomes cloudier in the afternoon.'

This morning, the
 sun rose over Stonehenge, bathing the fields and grazing 
sheep in a warm, orange glow. It was a similarly
 beautiful start to the day further north, in Northumberland, where the 
sun turned the sky around St Mary's lighthouse at Whitley Bay orange at 
dawn.

But not everyone was able to enjoy a relaxing, stress-free day after a live hand grenade exploded on a beach in front of hundreds of holidaymakers.

Explosion: Not everyone was able to enjoy a relaxing. stress-free day after a live hand grenade exploded on a beach in Dorset in front of hundreds of holidaymakers

Response: The live device, believed to have been washed up in recent storms, was discovered by a tourist on Charmouth beach. Above, the Royal Navy Bomb Squad

Operation: Coastguards evacuated more than 200 people from the packed beach, before army bomb disposal experts (pictured) carried out a controlled explosion

The unexploded device, believed to have been washed up in recent storms, was discovered by a hapless tourist, who sparked a major security 
scare when he found it on Charmouth beach, Dorset, picked it up and took
 it into a nearby fossil museum.

However,
 the man, aged in his 30s, was ordered to leave the popular tourist 
attraction and told to take the dangerous grenade back to the beach, 
where he gently placed it on the shingle before ringing 999.

Coastguards evacuated more than 200 people from the packed beach and lifeboat crews cleared the area of boats. A
 1,000ft cordon was put up around the rusty grenade before army bomb 
disposal experts carried out a controlled explosion behind a red, blue 
and yellow windbreak.

It
 is believed the grenade originated from Exercise Tiger - the disastrous
 D-Day rehearsal that took place in Lyme Bay exactly 70 years ago - and 
washed ashore in recent storms.

Splashing around: Emily Anderson (l-r), seven, Katy Sercombe, 12, Lizzy Anderson, ten, and Oli Sercombe, 15, cool off in a stream at West Dean Gardens in West Sussex

Looking happy: Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said that most of the country enjoyed balmy sunshine today. Above, sisters Lizzy and Emily play in the stream

Holding hands: But he added light rain was likely to fall tonight in parts of Scotland. Above, a woman and children walk across stones at Cliveden House, Buckinghamshire

Beautiful: Most of the country will enjoy warm and sunny conditions tomorrow, with the south east reaching temperatures of up to 19C. Above, cherry blossom

The Dorset beach will likely to be less packed on Friday, with an occasional shower of light rain forecast, followed by more warm, settled and 
sunny weather, which will continue on Saturday.

On
 Easter Sunday, however, the weather is likely to be more unsettled.  
Most of the UK is expected to enjoy above average temperatures of around
 16C or 17C, but there will also be rain across the country, and it may 
be heavy at times.

Mr 
Williams said: 'There will be rain on Sunday in the east and west and it
 could be heavy, but it won't be for the whole day and the rain showers 
will be scattered.

In blossom: Mr Williams said: 'There should be some good periods of sunshine tomorrow in southern areas.' Two women walk past a stunning display of Angelique tulips

Good forecast ahead: The hazy sky at Whitley Bay this morning augured well for a warm and sunny day, and this should continue til Easter Sunday, forecasters said

'There will be more rain on Monday 
but the showers should be fewer and further between and there's a good 
chance of it being a decent day, particularly in Northern Ireland, parts
 of Scotland, northern England and eastern parts as well.

'After that it looks like more clouds and a highter chance of rain.'

Conditions
 for next week are expected to be more unsettled with showers and rain, 
but brighter periods too, and the week after that is looking likely to 
be unsettled, with longer outbreaks of rain.
