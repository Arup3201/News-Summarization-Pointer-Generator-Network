The festive season usually brings heart-warming examples of compassion and kindness.

But for these puppies, it has not been a season of goodwill, as they were cruelly abandoned in a quarry in Leeds just days before Christmas.

Rescued from the freezing temperatures, The Dog Trust Leeds is now looking for a new home for the twelve-week-old puppies.

Staff named the 12-week-old puppies Jingle and Bells, and they are looking for a new home in the New Year

The duo, named Jingle and Bells, were severely underweight and suffering from mange when they were found by a passer-by and brought to the centre.

Currently recovering at the Dogs Trust centre in Leeds, the charity hope to successfully re-home them in the New Year.

Amanda Sands, manager at Dogs Trust Leeds, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: ‘Every year we see dogs like Jingle and Bells being abandoned over the Christmas period and it never gets any easier.

When they were found, both pups were severely underweight and suffering from mange, but are now recovering at the Dogs Trust centre in Leeds

‘The puppies were frightened, cold and in terrible condition when they first came to us.’

The centre, like many around the country, is constantly under strain from the number of dogs abandoned, rescued or given to the charity when owners feel they can no longer care for them.

The number of stray dogs dealt with 
by councils and authorities across the UK between April 1 2010 and March
 31 2011 was 126,176 - a 4 per cent increase on the previous year.

Dogs Trust care for around 16,000 dogs each year at 18 Rehoming Centres around the country and never destroy a healthy dog.

And sadly, there are many more...

Dogs, cats, rabbits... with their sad faces, these abandoned creatures would melt any heart.

They're among the Christmas guests at the RSPCA shelter in Stretton, Staffordshire.

Although the centre has seen an influx of people wanting to take animals home with them since Christmas, with around 15 cats and dogs re-homed at the weekend, there is still a long list of pets waiting to be housed at the centre.
