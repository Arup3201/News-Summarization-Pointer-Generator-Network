Beyonce proved that she doesn't need to spend thousands of dollars to look Flawless, when she wore a $350 frock to her sister's nuptials Sunday.

The 33-year-old sported a curve-hugging white dress by the label Torn by Ronny Kobo when she attended Solange Knowles's wedding to her video director boyfriend Alan Ferguson in New Orleans.

While Queen Bey has previously worn other pieces by Ms Kobo, the 34-year-old New York-based designer was surprised to see her Maggie Lasso Diamonds dress on display while watching coverage of the high-profile ceremony.

Flawless: Beyonce stunned in a $350 dress by Torn by Ronny Kobo at her sister Solange's wedding Sunday

'I was watching TV last night because I wanted to look at Solange’s wedding dress, and I had to do two or three double-takes, like, "Wait a minute - Beyonce is wearing my dress!"' she told the New York Daily News.

'My email is exploding. It’s such a compliment on so many levels. I’m really humbled by it. She could have worn any designer in the world, and the fact that she wore mine is just really incredible. And she’s one of my favorite musicians.'

The designer, who has also styled Taylor Swift, Sofia Vergara and Blake Lively, said she owns the dress herself, which is currently available for purchase on the site shopthetrendboutique.com, albeit only in an extra-small.

'It’s my go-to vacation dress. It’s very thick, very body-hugging and very flattering in length. It’s just a great dress, and you can’t find one angle of her in that dress that doesn't look flawless.'

Ms Kobo's dresses, which are meant to flatter women with curves, are clearly a great fit for the Bootylicious singer, who stepped out in a brocade print number by the designer in 2012. More recently, she sported a striped crop top and skirt from the brand.

As for the bride, Solange wore a long caped gown by Humberto Leon for Kenzo for the ceremony but arrived in a Stephane Rolland cream jumpsuit, having traveled to Holy Trinity Church on a white-painted bicycle decorated with cream roses.

The groom - 51-year-old Alan - also wore a white suit, as did Solange's adorable son Daniel Julez, 10.

In fact, Beyonce and Solange's mother Tina and the rest of the wedding party all wore white to the unconventional affair.

While Solange suffered an angry allergic breakout at the end of the ceremony, she was the epitome of elegance as she walked down the aisle with her long-term love Alan.

Solange sparked speculation she and Alan - who she began dating in 2008 - were getting married after posting an Instagram picture of herself and the director swimming in an ocean while holidaying on her birthday in June.

She wrote alongside the picture: 'Today couldn't have been more perfect. I couldn't have smiled harder. Thank you for all of your lovely and wonderful wishes. They warmed my heart and I simply feel grateful for all of the love.'
