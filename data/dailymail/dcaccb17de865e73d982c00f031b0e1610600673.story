A judge has ordered Daniel Morrissey, a father with a lengthy criminal record, to be placed in a pre-trial supervision program a week after his 10-year-old daughter and her 8-year-old cousin vanished.

Morrissey’s sister-in-law, Tammy 
Brousseau, also said that Iowa authorities have already accused the 
36-year-old and told him they had proof of his connection.

The change means Morrissey, 36, who has been free on bond for other charges, will be 
supervised by parole officers who will make sure he shows up in court 
and does not violate the terms of his release.

This news comes as a judge also ruled 
that he and his estranged wife Misty, the mother of missing 10-year-old 
girl Lyric Cook-Morrissey, are to have no contact during the duration of
the trial, except when they most appear in public together during the 
investigation.

Ms Brousseau told reporters: ‘They 
told him they had proof that he did it. They found out a couple of 
family members have a criminal history, so they’re focusing really hard 
on them.’

Sh also revealed that an attorney advised the couple to stop talking to 
reporters, discontinue television interviews and not agree to take any 
more polygraph tests.

Morrissey is the father of 
10-year-old Lyric Cook-Morrissey, who vanished near an Evansdale lake 
while riding bikes with her cousin, 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins. Their 
bikes were later found on a path near Meyers Lake.

A special 10-member FBI dive team 
used sonar equipment on a boat for hours Friday to search the 26-acre 
lake. Divers waded through the water looking for evidence but did not 
appear to go beneath the surface. By mid-afternoon, an FBI truck and 
many other police officers had left and little search activity was going
on.

Black Hawk County prosecutor Brad Walz
petitioned to place Morrissey under supervision Thursday, the day 
authorities said he and his wife had stopped cooperating with 
investigators.

Walz cited Morrissey's arrests on methamphetamine-related
charges and noted Iowa law allows a person on bond who is considered 'a
habitual felon' to remain under supervision as a condition of release.

The order issued by Senior Judge Jon 
Fister on Thursday said the sheriff's office should deliver the 
supervision notice personally to Morrissey, who was directed to report 
to corrections officials immediately after receiving it. Messages left 
for Morrissey's defense lawyer were not returned.

Morrissey has been charged with 
possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, conspiracy to 
manufacture methamphetamine and other crimes. He posted bond and was 
released in May.

Walz said Morrissey should have been 
placed under supervision then, but he declined comment on what prompted 
Thursday's order. He said Morrissey faces five charges that carry 
45-year prison terms each.

Court records from Black Hawk County,
Iowa show that both parents have multiple drug convictions and Misty 
was sentenced to four years in federal prison for helping to run a 
methamphetamine drug ring.

Indeed,
the couple have said that they have been questioned repeatedly by 
police investigating the disappearance of their daughter saying, 'You 
tell them the truth and they say, 'You're holding something back,' and 
you're not.'

The
Evansdale couple has commented that the extensive nature of the police 
inquiry has made them feel like they were under investigation in the 
case of missing Lyric and Elizabeth.

'It made me feel like, 'Yeah, they're looking at me like a suspect,' said Morrissey to ABC News.

Misty
was only released from prison on May 30 after serving time for nine 
different crimes, including illegal drug use, association with persons 
involved in criminal activity, excessive alcohol use and failure to 
comply with drug testing.

In
addition, eight years prior to that in 2003, Misty was sentenced to 
four years in jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to manufacture 
and distribute methamphetamine.

The sentence was later commuted to five months in prison and a full year of supervised release.

Other criminal convictions belonging to Misty include a 1998 ticket for having an open container of alcohol in a vehicle and in 1997 she entered a guilty plea for making a false report to police, a crime which cost her six days in prison.

Morrissey is facing a September trial in Black Hawk County after his arrests for drug possession that date from last year. A look back into court records reveals the depths into which Misty had fallen as she became involved in the meth trade.

Working for a David Mickelson, her former boss at the BIG Ten Mart in Waterloo, Iowa, Misty was a key member of the drugs ring eight years ago.

'Cook testified that she obtained pseudoephedrine pills from various people and provided them to Scott Reavis, who used them to make methamphetamine,' court records stated to the Des Moines Register

In fact, Morrissey stormed out of a long interview with law enforcement officials after they point blank accused him of killing Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, the girl's grandmother said.

'Yeah, there's history in our family, but it's not a history that we're scared of,' said 36-year-old Misty.

'It's one we've dealt with. It's one we've come past and we've come past it as a family so no matter what anybody thinks about it, it's not one that has anything to do with you know, the disappearance of our children.'

Rallying against the speculation that she and Morrissey may have been responsible for the deaths of Lyric and Elizabeth, Misty was adamant that their focus should be elsewhere.

'We want everybody in the main part of the criminal investigation who has the authority or the power to do things and make decisions, we want them focused on our girls and what might have happened to them,' said Misty.

'You know but if looking into our history is what's needed then that's fine, too.'

The revelations of the couples criminal past comes as the spotlight falls on the investigation into the disappearance of their daughter and Elizabeth Collins.

In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday morning, Misty explained how extensively they have been questioned by the police.

'We've done extensive interviews, hours at a time,' said Misty. 'We've done polygraphs. We have taken many phone calls, answered many questions,' adding that all of her phone data has been turned over to authorities.

An FBI expert and former special agent believes that law enforcement is looking at every angle they can in the case.

'What comes into question is how does that play into what is presently going on in their lives?' said Brad Garrett.

'And more particular, does it have any relationship to these two missing girls?'

It has also been revealed that in the week's before both girl's going missing, Misty and Daniel were having issues at home and were preparing to file for divorce.

'They are not a couple,' said Misty's sister Tammy Brousseau to ABC News.

'They are currently separated and maybe well on the way to a divorce.'

Daniel Morrissey also told reporters of his battle to keep a cool head during this stressful time. 'I'll tell you something about emotions,' said Morrissey. 'A lot of people base their decisions off emotions and it doesn't work out too well. They're angry, they make a bad decision, whatever.'

He continued: 'So emotions I try to keep control of and keep my head straight. 'During this time, it's definitely challenging, but I have to keep my mind right.'

Despite the interest from the authorities, Misty and Morrissey have cooperated fully with their investigation.

'They are still continuing to cooperate with us as we would expect,' said Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ricj Abben.

When asked about Morrissey and Misty feeling like suspects in their own daughters disappearance, Abben said he was unsure why.

'I don't know why he feels that way,' said Abben.

'We expect cooperation from everyone - 100 percent cooperation. So I don't know why he feels that way.'

Heather and Drew Collins, Elizabeth’s parents, have minor offenses in their backgrounds, an online check of court records shows.

Elizabeth and Lyric were last seen on Friday, riding their bicycles in downtown Evansdale, Iowa.

When they never returned home, hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, and their bikes were found next to Meyers Lake.

More than 350 volunteers joined the search over the weekend. Teams have been dragging the lake for the past several days but have found nothing.
