Three women nicknamed the 'Desperate 
Housewives' have been jailed for helping their partners and family members run a £500,000 drug trafficking empire from a leafy spa town.

Mother-of-one 
Fay Read, 24, trained nurse Victoria Clayton, 54, and mechanic’s wife 
Julie Scruton, 45, were key figures in a major family-run drugs ring based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

Read’s
 long term partner Joseph 'Big Joe' McIntyre, 37, was head of the racket
 and she would enjoy the proceeds of his crimes including exotic 
holidays, flash cars and designer clothing - all paid for in cash -
despite them being on benefits.

Role: Mechanic's wife Julie Scruton helped her brother Russell Baker, 35, store, mix and repackage large quantities of drugs behind the locked doors of her husband David's garage

Clayton
 would accompany her husband Martin, 50, on deals and often assisted 
him in the mixing and repackaging of drugs at their home.

Scruton also helped her brother Russell Baker, 35, store, mix and 
repackage large quantities of drugs behind the locked doors of her 
husband David’s garage.

The women, who neighbours dubbed the 'Desperate Housewives' after the trial, were 
arrested after North Yorkshire Police’s Organised Crime Unit seized 
£561,000 worth of heroin, cocaine, and amphetamine from various address 
in Harrogate as they investigated the operation, which ran between February 
and December 2012.

Police 
found £30,000 worth of drugs buried at in the town’s Stonefall Cemetery,
 and during the investigation officers found an incriminating text 
message on 
Clayton’s phone from her husband saying ‘Get the kitchen ready to do a 
big mix’, which officers suspected referred to he adulteration of drugs.

However, she tried to claim he had made a typing error and said it related to a 
Mexican-style meal that they would enjoy together and insisted it should
 have read: 'Get the kitchen ready to do a big Mex.'

Police
 said the drugs found were just the stock held by the gang at 
the time of the searches and represented only a 'fraction' of the total 
amount of drugs bought and sold by the McIntyre enterprise.

At
 Teeside Crown Court, Read who has a four year child with McIntyre was 
jailed for four years, Clayton was jailed for five years and Scruton got
 six years. McIntyre was jailed for six years whilst Scruton’s brother Baker was jailed for four and half years.

McIntyre’s
 younger brother Thomas McIntyre, 31, who would stand in for Joseph as 
the head of the operation whenever he was on holiday, was sentenced to 
six years’ behind bars. Clayton’s husband and McIntyre’s sister 
Philomena McIntyre, 36, will be sentenced at a later date

All
 were convicted by a jury or pleaded guilty to a range of offences 
including conspiracy to supply Class A and Class B drugs and money 
laundering. A jury could not reach verdicts on Scruton’s husband David, 
47.

James
 Kenny, 30, of Bootle, Merseyside was sentenced to 30
 months in jail after becoming a ‘gopher’ in the operation for a 
Merseyside drug-dealing syndicate which traded supplies with the 
Harrogate crime gang.

The court heard how the drugs racket began after McIntyre’s wheelie bin cleaning business was shut down.

Police
 said he and his gang used various cutting agents to bulk out the drugs 
in order to maximise their profits.

McIntyre, the gang’s 'director' 
usually distanced himself from the drugs but was caught during a major 
surveilllance operation in which police saw him hide 
3kg of methlamphetamine in undergrowth at the cemetery on November 
2, 2012.

Martin Clayton was one
 of McIntyre’s most trusted couriers and was regularly sent to Bootle, 
near Liverpool to carry out drug deliveries or cash collection. His wife
 joined him on at least one trip and was involved in cutting the drugs 
with bulking agent dextrose in their kitchen, the court heard.

During
 a raid at the Clayton home officers found 5kgs of heroin worth 
£284,810, 1kg of 44 per cent pure amphetamine worth £80,000 and 
half-a-kilogram of cutting agents. Police also found a drugs press and 
two pairs of digital scales containing traces of heroin.

The court heard that Scruton
 allowed drugs to be stored at her home and at her husband’s car repair 
business and she was seen visiting the garage outside opening hours 73 
times between August and December 2012. McIntyre his sister Philomena 
and Read, were also spotted visiting the garage outside business hours.

During
 a raid of the garage, officers recovered 1.5kg of heroin worth £95,830 
from under the floorboards in the loft, and 53.9 grams of 
cocaine, with a street value of £2,160, was found in a filing 
cabinet.

Sentenced: Russell Baker, 35, (left) was jailed for four and half years and James Kenny, 30, (right) was sentenced to 30 months after becoming a 'gopher' in the operation

Another raid at Scruton's home uncovered cocaine worth £1,330 and heroin worth £7,740 in 
the kitchen and dining room. Officers found 6kgs of amphetamine worth £60,000 in a bedroom and the garden shed. Bulking agents were also found 
in the shed.

Three days 
after the raid on the graveyard, Philomena McIntyre was seen rummaging around the
 cemetery to try to find the drugs along with her two brothers, the court was told.

David Gordon, prosecuting, said: 'There must have been considerable involvement to 
deal with these very large quantities of drugs. There was evidence of 
high living and there must be considerable sums of money still concealed
 to this day.

'The 
conspiracy was run by Joseph McIntyre, known to some within his 
organisation as "Big Joe". He employed a variety of tactics to keep his 
actions hidden from the police, such as the use of more than 10 "dirty 
phones" during the course of a year, couriers to transport his drugs and
 safe houses for the mixing, re-packaging and storage of drugs.

Base: The drugs ring operated out of the leafy spa town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire

'He
 and his partner, Fay Read, lived well on the proceeds of his 
drug-dealing organisation. Whilst on benefits or without any legitimate 
income they spent thousands of pounds on foreign holidays, vehicles and 
expensive living, mainly dealing in cash in an attempt to stay under the
 radar of the authorities.'

Mitigating, Read’s lawyer Christopher Smith said: 'She will miss 
being a mother in those wonderful early years of raising a child. She 
entered into this with a degree of naivity and was under the influence 
of others due to her relationship with someone with more criminal 
experience.'

Clayton’s 
lawyer Denise Breen-Lawton said: 'It is clear that her husband, 
Martin Clayton, brought the drugs into her home and her life. There was 
no high living, she was naïve and didn’t know the value of the drugs or 
the drug chain. She has been ostracised by her family and is scared to 
go to prison.'

After the hearing, Det Insp Mark Pearson, of North Yorkshire Police’s organised crime unit, said each member of the gang played a part in the operation.

'Joseph McIntyre was undoubtedly the main 
man at the head of the operation and went to great lengths to ensure 
that he had little contact with the drugs, instead getting other people 
to store, cut, and courier the drugs for him,' he said.

'He also reaped the benefits of the conspiracy enjoying expensive foreign holidays and buying cars, which he paid for in cash.

'But
 every member of this gang played a significant part in the conspiracy 
and their involvement in this organised crime group cannot be 
underestimated either. Without their commitment to bulking out the drugs
 to enhance McIntyre’s profits and their willingness to use their own 
homes and businesses to stash the supplies the conspiracy wouldn’t have 
continued for as long as it did.'
