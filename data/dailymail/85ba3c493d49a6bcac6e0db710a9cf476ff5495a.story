A father whose teenage son was found guilty of killing four and seriously injuring two others while driving drunk has been arrested for impersonating a police officer in Texas.

Fred Couch’s son Ethan, 16, was only sentenced to ten years’ probation in December following the horrific car wreck after his defense attorney argued he suffered from a condition called 'affluenza' which means he is so spoiled by his mother and father he is not fully responsible for his actions.

Couch senior was arrested on Tuesday morning after he was found to have falsely identified himself as a police officer at an incident in North Richland Hills in the early hours of July 28.

Fred Couch, whose teenage son Ethan was found guilty of killing four and seriously injuring two others while driving drunk, has been arrested for impersonating a police officer in North Richland Hills, Texas

Officers responding to a disturbance call at a house report that Couch was already on the scene when they arrived,

Police say he identified himself as a reserve officer in Lakeside, a small town located about 12 miles northeast of Fort Worth.

After officers had completed their disturbance investigation they turned their attention to Couch, who insisted he was a Lakeside Police Department reserve officer, reports WFAA.

'Couch reached into his vehicle and took out his wallet displaying what appeared to be a police badge and identification card, suggesting he was a police officer,' North Richland Hills investigator K. Bauman said.

Ethan Couch's parents Tonya, left, and Fred, right, have more than 20 criminal and traffic offense claims on their records - but have never served any time in prison

'Upon completion of the call, all subjects involved were allowed to leave the location.'

But the officers kept looking into Couch’s claim, and after doing some digging, determined that he has never been licensed as a Texas peace officer.

Couch was arrested and charged with False Identification As A Police Officer: Misrepresentation Of Property. He was later released after posting bond set at $2,500.00.

Millionaire sheet metal manufacturer Fred and ex-wife Tonya have more than 20 criminal and traffic offense claims on their records - but have never served any time in prison.

They have several driving citations on
 their records and Mr Couch has been arrested for alleged crimes 
including theft, evading arrest and an alleged assault against Mrs 
Couch, according to official court documents obtained at the Johnson County Court records office in Cleburne.

But
 aside from a number of small fines for their motoring offenses and a 
six-month community supervision order issued to Mrs Couch, neither of 
them have been punished further.

Previous:
 Fred couch, Ethan Couch's father, has a long list of criminal and 
traffic citations against him on record from speeding charges, theft to 
even assault against his now ex-wife, Tonya

Criminal: Mother Tonya Couch paid a $500 for driving another motorist off the road

Spared:
 Ethan Couch was sentenced to 10-years probation rather than 20-years in
 jail after he killed 4 people in a DUI incident in June

In fact all of the more serious cases against Mr Couch, going back as far as 1989, have been dismissed.

Charges were dropped in the two theft cases, because Mr Couch paid substantial restitution.

That my be particularly relevant to his son's case. Gerry Miller, a psychologist testifying on behalf of the defense in Ethan Couch’s trial, told the court: ‘The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone. If you hurt someone, you sent him money.’

A source at the Johnson County court records office in Cleburne told MailOnline that Mr Couch ‘must have a very good attorney’.

According to official documentation, Mr Couch, 48, has a blizzard of 22 accusations on his record, made up of four criminal misdemeanor allegations and 18 traffic violations.

They resulted in nine driving citation fines for offenses ranging from doing 95mph in a 60mph zone, to driving without his license.The majority of the other citations were dismissed.

On top of that he has been arrested over allegations of theft twice and evading arrest once. In June 1988 he allegedly bought a $46 pair of shoes with a worthless check, but the case was dismissed after he ‘paid full restitution of $830.56’.

Killed:
 Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping 
out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by 
Couch's out-of-control pickup

Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash

In April 1992 he was again accused of using a worthless check, this time to buy $26.41 of gas. And again the case was dismissed after he paid $274.80.

Two years earlier he was accused of evading arrest. That case was also dismissed, although it is unclear why from court records. 

And in 1996 he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife. Records state he, ‘intentionally and knowingly caused bodily injury to Tonya Couch by striking’ her ‘on or about the face with his hands causing Tonya to fall, and by grabbing’ her ‘on or about the neck with his hands, scratching’ her ‘neck’.

On that occasion Mrs Couch submitted a sworn affidavit of non-prosecution, meaning the case was dismissed.

Her police record is shorter. In 2003 she was charged with a misdemeanor offense of reckless driving after she, ‘intentionally and knowingly drove a motor vehicle in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property’. 

Court records say she pulled up behind a fellow motorist and then pulled alongside them forcing them onto the shoulder of the road.

Mrs Couch was hit with a $500 fine and a six month community supervision order.

She was also stopped for speeding and three counts of failing to adequately secure children under 17-years-old that same year.

Left
 alone to live in luxury: This is the mansion on Burleson Retta Rd. in 
Burleson, Texas that Ethan Couch hosted wild parties at while 
unsupervised

The defense attorney hired by Fred and Tonya Couch to act on behalf of their son slammed their parenting skills and blamed them for their son’s horrendous actions, which happened at around 11.45pm on June 15.

Couch and a group his friends got into a red Ford F350 pick-up – owned by his father’s company - and were speeding at 70mph in a 40mph zone when the truck left the road.

As it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four Good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact.

Trial notes claim the cocky teenager said 'I'm Ethan Couch, I'll get you out of this,' to one of his passengers at the scene.

It was revealed soon after that his blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium when he started the chain reaction of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported.

In court a top defense attorney hired by the Couch family argued that the teen was not responsible for his actions.

Dr Miller, blamed his behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have'.

A cross is all the remains of the crash site: Ethan Couch, 16, was driving under the influence when he killed 4 in a crash that occurred a short distance from his father's house on Burleson Retta Rd. in Burleson, Texas

Dr Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences.

'The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.'

State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense and gave him ten years’ probation and counseling at a 'country club'-style treatment center - at a cost of $450,000 in  Newport Beach, California, paid for by his father.

The ruling caused outrage around the nation, with many claiming Couch only escaped jail because of his parents' wealth.
