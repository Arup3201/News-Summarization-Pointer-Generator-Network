Figures show that where nearly 8 per cent of households in Salford (pictured) who are meant to pay, wriggle out of it

Council tax bills could be cut by an average £100 per household if authorities chased up debts properly.

Slack enforcement of council tax debts is costing households and local authorities, creating large disparities between areas with similar family incomes.

Some £604 million of council tax, or 2.6 per cent, went uncollected in England last year.

If councils were to recover the £604 million, it would be enough to meet all the staffing costs of public libraries, cover the cost of Sure Start childcare for nearly half a million children and pay for two-thirds of the government's free school meals for infants.

Councils have complained that cuts in funding from central government will force them to either raise council tax bills or slash services. But the varying disparity in collection rates will raise questions over the validity of their complaints.

The worst collection rate in the country is in Salford, where nearly 8 per cent of households who are meant to pay, wriggle out of it.

Its enforcement rate of 92.1 per cent lags behind the City of London's 99.5 per cent.

The average for English councils is 97.4 per cent. If Salford were to reach this national average, the bill for a house in Band F of council tax (valued at £120,000 to £160,00) could come down by nearly £123.

Analysis by the Civil Enforcement Association (CIVEA) compared council tax enforcement for areas with similar profiles in 2012/13.

Manchester City only managed to collect 92.9 per cent of the council tax owed, while Newcastle City achieved 97.1 per cent.

Experts said if Manchester achieved a similar rate as Newcastle, council tax could be slashed by 4.2 per cent and still yield the same total for the local authority. This would reduce the bill for a band F property by £86.36.

Nottingham City also collected just 93.5 per cent, compared to Dudley Borough's more impressive 98 per cent. If Nottingham could achieve the same collection rate, council tax could be slashed by 4.5 per cent and still rake in the same for the town hall. This would reduce the bill for a band e property by £94.05.

Steve Everson, director general of CIVEA said: 'These figures show that those local authorities that take a more proactive approach to the enforcement of council tax are helping to ease the financial burden on taxpayers and protecting revenue for vital public services on which vulnerable people depend.'

He added: 'In an economic climate where Council Tax bills are set to rise by 0.6 per cent on average across local authorities in England, and by 4.6 per cent in Wales, this proportion of uncollected tax, upwards of £600m, represents a missed opportunity.'

Bailiffs have also said the reasons that debtors are giving for not paying their council tax are getting increasingly absurd.

One debtor told a bailiff that they could not make their monthly instalment as they had to pay for a funeral of a cat.

Another said his fish tank broke, flooding his living room so he had to replace the tank and fish.

Bailiffs heard that one man tried to avoid paying council tax as he had to put the money towards a stag party instead.

Another enforcement officer greeted a supposedly broke debtor who had returned from her three week holiday in Florida. She complained he had ruined her holiday by turning up.

Mr Everson said: 'These excuses can be quite astonishing but they mask a real problem in that those who avoid their council tax when they can afford to pay it are increasing the costs for everyone else.'
