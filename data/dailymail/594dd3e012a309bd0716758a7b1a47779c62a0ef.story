Three people were killed and six injured when cars collided with spectators in two different crashes within hours of each other at the Jim Clark Rally in the Scottish Borders.

Police said the most serious crash took place at about 4pm when a competing car came off the road near Kelso, hitting spectators.

Three were pronounced dead at the scene and a fourth is in a critical condition in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

Two hours earlier, a rally car hit five people. Four were treated at the scene and another is in a serious condition in hospital.

Police Scotland said the the rally was cancelled after the fatal crash.

Fatality: Three people are dead and one is in a critical condition after crashes during the Jim 
Clark Rally

Two crashes: The tragic collisions took place less than two hours apart

Official confirmation of the crashes came almost seven hours after the first collision.

Eyewitnesses to the fatal crash described 'terrible' scenes.

Spectator Tony Cowan told the BBC: 'It was just one car which lost control. It went sideways one way and then to the other side of the road and ploughed into four people.

'It was terrible, absolutely terrible. I ran to help but there was little I could do. The air ambulance arrived after about three quarters of an hour. There were police cars and ambulances. It was chaos, just chaos.'

Another spectator, Tommy Tait, wrote on Facebook: 'We must be like cats have nine lives never have we been so close to getting wiped out by a rally car our thoughts go out to the 4 who got hit.'

The rally takes place over three days 
on closed roads in the Duns and Kelso areas and is named after Scottish 
Formula One driver Jim Clark, who grew up
 in the area. He was killed in a motor racing accident in Hockenheim, 
Germany, in 1968.

Local MSP 
John Lamont said: 'This is tragic news for the Borders, and my thoughts 
and prayers are with the victims and their families.

Investigating: Police are looking into the incidents and cancelled the remainder of the event

'I
 know that the rally organisers place considerable emphasis on the 
safety of the spectators and drivers but with any event of this nature, 
there will always be an element of risk.

'I
 live just a few miles away from the scene of the accident and I know 
that everyone is shocked and saddened by this dreadful news.'

In a statement, police said: 'Police 
Scotland are investigating two road collisions at the Jim Clark Rally in
 the Scottish Borders this afternoon.

'A serious incident occurred around 4pm when a rally car came off the road near Kelso and collided with spectators.

'Emergency services attended and three people were pronounced dead at the scene.

'The
 fourth person was conveyed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and is in a 
critical condition. The Jim Clark Rally was stopped at that time.

'An earlier incident occurred at 2.05pm, when a rally car collided with five people.

'Four people were treated at the scene and one person was conveyed to hospital where they are in a serious condition.

The rally is named after Scottish Formula One driver Jim Clark and takes 
place over three days near the towns of Kelso, pictured, and Duns

'Police are in attendance at the scene and the investigation into both collisions is at an early stage.'

The Jim Clark Rally is described as the only closed road rally in the UK mainland.

The racing competition is held over three days on closed roads in the Duns and Kelso areas.

It is named after Scottish Formula
 One driver Jim Clark, who grew up in the area. He was killed in a motor
 racing accident in Hockenheim, Germany, in 1968.

It takes place over three days near the Scottish Borders towns of Kelso and Duns and includes the BRC Rally, National, Clubman, Historic, Reivers and Landrover rallies.

In 2011, a spectator was airlifted to hospital after being struck by a car while watching the rally.

The 36-year-old was hit by a driver who lost control of their vehicle and went onto the grass.

A spokesman for the event told MailOnline it had been a difficult day but it could not make any further comment at this stage.
