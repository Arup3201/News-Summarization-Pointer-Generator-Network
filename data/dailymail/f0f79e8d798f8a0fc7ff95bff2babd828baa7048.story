A beastly New Yorker who killed his long-suffering wife with a can of peas because she wouldn't pay for extra TV channels has been dealt the ultimate karma - choking to death on a piece of chicken.

Thomas Scala, 58, was hoeing into the chicken dinner in his Staten Island home on July 12 when he got a chunk lodged in his throat and was rushed to hospital where he died a week later.

He was buried on July 24, the same day he was to be sentenced to five years probation for fatally beating his wife, Blanche, two years ago, according to The New York Post.

'It’s karma,' the victim's sister, Gloria Sellitto, told The Post. 'If there is a god, he was punished. He choked on a chicken.

'He got what he deserved. He's a chicken. The chicken got served.'

Scala
bludgeoned Blanche with the tinned legumes on November 26, 2010, 
because he was irritated the 59-year-old hadn't paid $5.75-a-day so he 
could watch premium TV while he was in hospital over Thanksgiving.

The
brutal beating set off another brain injury the woman had suffered 
previously at the hands of Scala, who Sellitto claims was a 'sociopath.'

'I don’t have anything good to say about him,' Sellitto told The Post.

'He was not a father, or a husband. He was drug addict. A con artist and a sociopath.'

'He never admitted to anything he ever did in his life. He was not remorseful at all. He kept saying he didn’t do anything wrong.'

Blanche Scala had attempted to pack her clothes and leave after her husband was released from hospital and returned home in a rage about the TV channels.

He was said to have covered her 
belongings with rubbing alcohol - used to treat bedridden patients for 
bedsores - and used a can of hairspray to ignite them.

Mrs Scala suffered burns to her hands as she tried to put the fire out and then left to go to a friend's house.

She went to Staten Island University 
Hospital to get the burns treated but when she returned to the friend's 
later on Scala was there and started to harass her, according to reports.

Scala left after police were called. However, just before Mrs Scala was going to sleep she told her friend she felt sick and had a headache.

She was found unconscious on the sofa and was later pronounced dead.

Sellitto told The Post her sister’s family felt probation was a joke but that they believe the man will get his just desserts in the afterlife.

'She raised two wonderful sons, and would have been a grandmother in a few months,' she said.

'We try to remember the happiness. We loved her very much. Miss her dearly everyday.'

The Staten Island District Attorney’s office listed the case as 'abated by death' on Monday.
