Former Denver Broncos tight end Nate Jackson lasted six years in the NFL, and his revelations about the easy sex, constant drug use and horrific injuries of his football career make for incredible reading.

In his memoir, Slow Getting Up: A Story of NFL Survival from the Bottom of the Pile, Jackson, now 34, tells of the women that approach players in clubs and pain-killing injections before every game.

But most alarming is Jackon's catalog of gruesome injuries. 'I dislocated my shoulder multiple times, separated both shoulders, broke my tibia, broke a rib, broke my fingers, tore my medial collateral ligament in my right knee, tore my groin off the bone, tore my hamstring off the bone twice,' he writes.

Despite his injury problems, Jackson signed a $2 million contract (plus added escalators) with the Broncos in 2008, before moving to the Cleveland Browns for the 2009 NFL season.

Pain: Nate Jackson #89 of the Denver Broncos (right) hits the ground with Will Allen #25 of the New York Giants in 2005. Jackson's memoir tells of how his NFL career ravaged his body with scores of injuries

Wracked by physical problems, he was 
released by Cleveland before the games began. Jackson then signed with 
the Las Vegas Locomotives of the UFL but never played for the team 
before retiring.

In an adaption of his book by Deadspin,
 Jackson also describes bone chips, concussions, strains, tears, spine 
trauma, nerve damage, tendinitis and possible brain damage.

But
 he explains that to try and make it as an NFL player he constantly had 
to conceal the pain. 'No matter how bad anything hurt, I could get 
through practice without showing it,' he remembers.

Casual sex provided Jackson with
 some relief, and he describes the groupies that chase NFL players in clubs
 as 'a mob of bloodthirsty jersey chasers' or 'approachable vampires.'

He tells of a typical night out where 'women have emerged from the fog, 
pulled toward us by our oversized pituitaries and our cave man libidos, 
vibrating the floorboards like a Dr. Dre bass line...'

'Now everything is open wide: arms, 
doors, and legs. We are young, physically powerful men with money,' he 
writes in an extract in the New York Times.

Shot through: Former Denver Broncos tight end Nate Jackson suffered serious injuries all over his body, but played through the pain

Jackson imagines a conversation with one of the women in the club, where she says: 'But you’re on the practice squad!' He replies: 'But you're a s**t!'

But after Jackson agreed to his first
 pain-relieving injection he writes: 'Thus began my long relationship 
with the needle-as-savior approach to injury treatment...

'The needle was the last resort when pain was too much or progress too slow.'

He

 admits to taking a shot of Todoral before every game, as his body is 
riven with pain throughout the week. 'Every game a needle,' Jackson 
ruefully writes.

Jackson was a wide-receiver at Menlo 
College in California before being signed as an undrafted free agent by 
the San Francisco 49ers and spending the 2002 season in the practice 
squad.

He signed for the Broncos in 2003 and converted to a tight end in 2005, making a first career start in 2007.

New direction: Jackson (center) started his writing career in 2010. He posted this picture to his Twitter feed in September with the caption: 'Editors or oysters: who's slimier?'

Jackson goes through blood platelet therapy after a horrifying injury swells his groin into a 'watermelon.'

This operation works the first time but later interventions have little effect on Jackson's ravaged body.

The San Jose native reveals that he self-medicated through the difficult times with marijuana and recommends in the book: 'The N.F.L. should remove marijuana from their banned substances list.

'Don’t tell anyone about it: just stop testing for it. Pain is a big 
problem in the N.F.L.'

After spending 2003 to 2008 with the Broncos, Jackson signed with the Cleveland Brown and the Las Vegas Locomotives, but didn't play for either team.

He reaches a dark end to his football playing days when he experiments with illegal human growth hormones from Mexico, but these don't have the desired effect.

'Either I’m not doing it right or my body doesn’t like it,' Jackson writes, and after a few months of guilt and 'sneaking around' he throws the drugs away.

Jackson's painful football career ended after yet another hamstring injury and he started writing in 2010.
