He makes no secret of his love of cannabis. He has even campaigned to legalise it.

But it seems notorious gangster rapper Snoop Dogg mellowing towards more law-abiding forms of vegetation as he approaches middle age.

The Drop It Like It's Hot star has posted a video on YouTube congratulating a retired farmer on his record-breaking swede - and invited him backstage at his upcoming gig in Cardiff in a bid to learn the secret.

Ian Neale, 68, who smashed the Guinness World Record last month with his 85.5lb (6st) swede, was left stunned - but said he won't be taking up the offer because he is a country and western fan.

The 34-second clip starts with Snoop, wearing a Cardiff City shirt and standing against a background of cannabis leaves, saying: 'What up? Shout out to my home boy Ian Neale in Cardiff for breaking the world record for the biggest vegetable.

'When I do my show in Cardiff, I want you to come backstage and see me because I do vegetation myself and I want to know your secret so I can show you my vegetables and see if you can grow that into a real big vegetable.

'Come see your boy Snoop Dogg, I've got two tickets for you when I get to town.'

Mr Neale, from Newport, South Wales, said: 'It's very nice to be asked, but I'm more of a country and western man myself.'

Snoop's appreciation of green-fingered pursuits is in contrast to his regular brushes with the law, which has seen him arrested a number of times for marijuana possession since he burst onto the scene with his second album Doggystyle in 1993.

In 2006, he was banned from entering the UK following a brawl between his entourage and security at Heathrow Airport.

The following year, the Home Office prevented him from obtaining a visa to enter the country over fears it could inspire crime among fans.

Back in Britain: Snoop hosts a press conference to promote his new album Doggumentary at gentlemen's club Platinum Lace in London in May after his UK ban was lifted last year

But a judge ruled in 2008 that Snoop had not been at fault during the incident and the ban was fully overturned last year.

In 2010, Snoop, real name Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, also released a video backing the effort to legalise marijuana in California.

The American is due to play Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena on Saturday on a UK tour promoting his eleventh studio album, Doggumentary.
