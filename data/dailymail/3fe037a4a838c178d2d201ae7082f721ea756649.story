A scandal-hit hospital  has been branded one of the worst in England after the number of patient complaints reportedly doubled in the last year.

Colchester General Hospital is also  facing a shortfall of 170 nurses, it has been claimed.

It comes just weeks after a 'major incident' was declared at the hospital and all but the most seriously ill patients were told to stay away from its A&E department.

A total of 2,997 patients raised concerns about poor treatment last year - or eight a day - up from 1,592 in the previous year, according to figures published in The Sun. 

Dr Katherine Rake, head of Healthwatch England, told the newspaper: 'In the last year Colchester has gone from mid-table to one of the worst hospitals in the country'.

And the Royal College of Nursing has said the hospital needs to fill a shortfall of 170 nurses, the newspaper claimed.

Colchester General Hospital was put into special measures last November after a Care Quality Commission report found the records of 22 cancer patients out of a sample of 61 had been altered to disguise ‘extensive delays for treatment’.

Police were asked to probe claims staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to alter waiting times.

The CQC carried out a surprise inspection earlier this month after receiving ‘information of concern’.

This led to the trust announcing a ‘major incident’ and all but the most seriously ill patients being barred from A&E.

It is now only handling urgent cases after a surprise inspection found staff swamped by ‘unprecedented demand’. 

A Department of Health source told the Daily Mail earlier this month that the trust has suffered from long-term problems, stemming largely from weak management. 

On Wednesday, Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell, who met with hospital bosses and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt the day before, said he was optimistic the current situation 'will be resolved within a few days'. 

A review in 2010 also found that in four of the five previous years, Colchester Hospital reported higher than expected death rates.
