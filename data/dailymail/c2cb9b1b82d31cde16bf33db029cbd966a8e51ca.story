The Trojan Horse plot to take over Birmingham schools is driven by the same 'warped' Islamic extremism as Nigerian terror group Boko Harem, Tony Blair claimed this morning.

Mr Blair said the alleged plot by Muslim hardliners in Birmingham was part of a wider global problem of 'extremism based on a warped and abusive view of a religion'.

Six Birmingham schools were placed in special measures after the education watchdog Ofsted unearthed damning evidence that school children were being left at risk of being radicalised.

Tony Blair this morning likened the alleged Trojan Horse Islamic plot to take over Birmingham schools to the Nigerian terror network Boko Harem

Mr Blair said the scandal showed Britain had a problem with extremism - like Nigeria had with Boko Harem, the terror network which sparked global outrage after kidnapping hundreds of school girls.

He said the issue was part of a wider narrative of religious extremism that had to be met head on

The former PM said: 'I have a very clear view of this. There is a fundamental problem that we face that may have originated in this region but has now spread across the world.

'And that problem is extremism based on a warped and abusive view of a religion.

'It is a problem here in the region, it's a problem in countries like Pakistan, it's a problem in the far East.

'We can see from Nigeria and Boko Haram it's a problem in African countries and it's a problem in our own society as we can see from the issue of the Birmingham schools.

'What we need to do is not a question of simply reasserting British values. We have to assert the strong values of religious respect and tolerance for difference.

'In other words, to say that the only way the only way a modern economy and a modern society can work is if people of different faiths learn to live with each other, respect each other and treat each other equally and fairly.

'And any politics that is based on a view that "this is my religion, or this is my view of my religion and if you don't agree then you're my enemy", that is the ideology that we have to attack and root out.'

David Cameron reacted to the revelations that Muslim hardliners had tried to take over a number of Birmingham schools by announcing a drive to 'teach British values' to all children

Dave Hughes, Vice Chairman of Park View School - one of the academies put in special measures - attacked the Ofsted findings

The controversial intervention came after David Cameron called for UK Muslims to be more British in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal.

Mr Cameron said extremism and division was flourishing because of a 'worrying' failure to push British values. He said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the Magna Carta.

The Prime Minister's intervention came after teachers were told by the Education Secretary Michael Gove that they must in future 'actively promote British values'.

Home Secretary Theresa May and the Education Secretary Michael Gove fell out over the Government's response to Islamic extremists

Mr Cameron said these values would include 'a belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law'.

Writing in the Mail on Sunday he said these values were 'as British as the Union Flag, as football, as fish and chips. He added that it was 'not an option' for anyone living in this country not to live by them.

He also suggested that any move away from the 'Western model' of democracy and free enterprise would threaten Britain's economic success.

Mr Cameron said: 'In recent years we have been in danger of sending out a worrying message: that if you don't want to believe in democracy, that's fine; that if equality isn't your bag, don't worry about it; that if you're completely intolerant of others, we will still tolerate you.

'This has not just led to division, it has also allowed extremism - of both the violent and non-violent kind - to flourish," he said in the article.

'We need to be far more muscular in promoting British values and the institutions that uphold them.

'A genuinely liberal country believes in certain values, actively promotes them and says to its citizens: this is what defines us as a society.'

Mr Cameron said it was 'a matter of pride and patriotism' to promote British values and history and urged people to stop being 'squeamish' about doing so.

'As President Obama put it when he addressed MPs and peers in Parliament, "What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world".'

Celebrations are planned next year to mark 800 years since King John signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede which established for the first time that the king was subject to the law.

Mr Cameron said they will now include lessons for all pupils.

Mr Gove believed Mrs May was not doing enough to take on fanatics

'The remaining copies of that charter may have faded, but its principles shine as brightly as ever, and they paved the way for the democracy, the equality, the respect and the laws that make Britain, Britain.

'So I want to use this upcoming 800th anniversary as an opportunity for every child to learn about the Magna Carta, for towns to commemorate it, for events to celebrate it.'

Mr Gove pledged 'decisive action' after schools inspector Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools.

Inspections conducted following claims of a takeover plot by hardline Muslims found that a 'culture of fear and intimidation' has developed in some schools.

A poll by Opinium for the Observer showed that 58 per cent of voters believe faith schools should not receive taxpayer funding, or be closed altogether.

It found three quarters are concerned there is a serious risk pupils could be encouraged to adopt extremist views in predominantly Muslim schools.

Most, 56 per cent, also thought all faith schools should not be allowed to teach only their own religion.

None of those which faced inspections over the 'Trojan Horse' allegations were faith schools but shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said he would like cross-party talks on the issue.

'Events in Birmingham have raised questions about faith, multiculturalism and state education and in the aftermath this is the moment to think about discussing, on a cross-party basis, how we manage potential tensions, particularly in urban districts,' he told the newspaper.

He called for strong powers for Ofsted to inspect teaching of religion and backed the idea that schools should teach about other faiths.
