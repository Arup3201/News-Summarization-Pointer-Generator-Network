Runner-up in the most picturesque list was Yorkshire, complete with its two national parks (North York Moors and the Yorkshire Dales). They polled 18 per cent.

Yorkshire features over 800 attractions, from World Heritage Sites to mining museums, ruined castles and abbeys, to hands on museums. 

You'll find serene gardens and unique breweries, thrilling rides and industrial heritage. From attractions and museums to sports and galleries, from the history-lover to the inquisitive child, there's something for everyone.

In third spot was Cumbria, who have their own national park in the Lake District, scored 11.5 per cent.

The county is best known for containing the Lake District National Park, an area some 30 miles across, containing England's highest mountains (four over 3000 ft), and some of England's biggest lakes. 

Looking down towards Seathwaite Valley from Sour Milk Gill in the Lake District, UK, it's clear to see why Cumbria snared third place

Devon came fourth in the list of England's most picturesque counties with 11 per cent of the vote

The county contains the Eden Valley, part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding natural Beauty (AONB), the western end of Hadrian's Wall, and some 180 miles of coastline along the county's west coast.

Cumbria has something to offer all visitors, young and old, those seeking adventure, and those seeking peace and quiet, with its history, landscape of mountains and lakes, and much more.

Tom Lowes of Sykes Cottages said: 'Cornwall has always been a favourite destination of ours at Sykes Cottages so we were thrilled to see it top the list.

The view of the Kent village of Goudhurst from the church tower is akin to something out of a fairy tale, and right, the Oast houses in Horsmonden are unique in their own special way

'It's also unsurprising that Yorkshire and Cumbria rank highly thanks to their spectacular National Parks. Yorkshire is also still riding high from the Tour de France last year, and the Tour de Yorkshire in May will no doubt bring more people to the county.

'What's clear from this poll is beauty can be found across the UK if you're looking for it. We have some of the most picturesque landscapes in Europe on our doorstep and there is no excuse not to go out and visit them.'

Yorkshire was a particular favourite among the 18-24 year age group and Yorkshiremen and women themselves, although the same could not be said for all counties on the list.

The findings echo a recent report from Google which found Cornwall was the fifth most searched for destination last year and the only UK destination in the top 10 list.
