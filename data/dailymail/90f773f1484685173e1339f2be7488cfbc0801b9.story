A baby girl has been saved from a deadly brain tumor after an insurer which refused to fund surgery at a specialist hospital had a change of heart.

Little Savannah Snodgrass's tumor was removed during a six-hour surgery at the renowned Texas Children's Hospital in Houston about two weeks ago.

Pediatricians told the eight-month-old's family yesterday that the growth was non-cancerous and she was on the mend.

'We have tears of joy. We are so thrilled,' Savannah's mother, Tessa Snodgrass, told FoxNews.com.

'There is some risk for re-growth and continued epilepsy, but this is the best news we could hear.'

On the mend: Savannah Snodgrass's brain tumor was removed during a six-hour surgery at the renowned Texas Children's Hospital in Houston about two weeks ago

Snodgrass, a retired Army major, added her daughter will likely need regular MRI tests until she is 20-years-old.

Savannah's brain tumor was detected in March when she was three-months-old. She suffered major seizures, at one point being hit by 15 in the space of a single day.

The Snodgrass's insurer, Superior HealthPlan, referred Savannah to Texas Children's Hospital for the last four months for her treatment.

Specialists
 at the hospital then produced a plan for beating the tumor, scheduling several procedures for which, Tessa Snodgrass claims, 
her insurers happily paid.

However, at the last minute, the insurer refused to cover the final surgery, saying the hospital was outside its 'network'. They instead referred her to another facility in Austin, Texas.

The family fought the decision, creating a petition on Change.com that's been signed by more than 1,600 people.

The family claimed that Texas Children's hospital had a 90 per cent survival rate for the 
operation Savannah was booked for, compared with just 47 per cent for the other facility.

'I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time,' 38-year-old Tessa Snodgrass told FoxNews.com.

'It's
 rare for a tumor to be found in a child this young, it so clearly 
called for a neurosurgeon specialized in operating on babies - not just 
any surgeon. Would you accept less than a 50-50 survival rate when you can have almost 100 per cent?'

Superior HealthPlan insisted that the new provider would be just as good.

However earlier this month they reversed their decision, allowing Savannah to undergo surgery at Texas Children's Hospital on July 11.

'Our No. 1 priority has been to deliver the best health outcome for this child, as it is for all of our members,' the company said in a July 11 statement.

'Superior is happy to have identified a solution that ensures that this child receives continued care from the provider established prior to their enrollment with Superior. We will continue to assist this family in making sure they receive the care they need.'
