Stevan Jovetic has been dropped from Manchester City's Champions League squad to make room for Wilfried Bony.

The Montenegro international, signed from Fiorentina for £22m in 2013, could now be set to depart the club after he was chosen as the fall guy to allow £28m Bony into the group.

Jovetic, whose time at City has been disrupted by injuries, has begun only 18 games in 19 months. At one point City fans jokingly referred to him as 'The Invisible Man' following a mystery illness which kept him off the field.

Bony, signed from Swansea, has leapt ahead of Jovetic in the City strikers' pecking order

He is yet to score a goal in Europe and, despite his versatility, now has confirmation that he lies below Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Bony in the Blues' pecking order.

The omission is not thought to have gone down well with the 25-year-old who may seek a summer move away from the Etihad Stadium with Juventus known admirers.

Jovetic's misery is good news for Bacary Sagna.

The ex-Arsenal right back was thought to be favourite for the axe but a sterling performance in City's 1-1 draw at title rivals Chelsea will have done him no harm.

Manuel Pellegrini's side will face Barcelona at home on February 24 before travelling to Catalonia for the second leg on March 18.

Bony, who joined from Swansea City, is currently at the Africa Cup of Nations with new team-mate and fellow Ivory Coast international Yaya Toure.

They qualified for the final on Wednesday night with a 3-1 win over DR Congo.
