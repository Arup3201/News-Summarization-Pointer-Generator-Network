He has long been accused of chillaxing on the job.

Now it seems Larry the Downing Street moggy has had one cat nap too many for his owner's liking.

In his second major reshuffle in two weeks, David Cameron has reportedly sacked his pet as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet after finally growing tired of Larry's lethargy.

One chillax too many: Larry the Downing Street cat has been sacked as chief mouse catcher by David Cameron after a dismal performance this year

It took Larry six months in the post before he made his first 'confirmed kill' last month and he doesn't appear to have made any since.

The breaking point came on Thursday when the Prime Minister found Larry asleep on his chair in his Number 10 study as a mouse ran across the room, according to The People.

He attempted to wake Larry to spur him into action, but all the feline could manage was to open one eye and duly didn't budge an inch.

Mr Cameron has now drafted in Chancellor George Osborne's tabby Freya as the new Mouser of State to patrol Numbers 10, 11 and 12.

Sources claim Larry will be completely sidelined and have described the new arrangement as a 'job share' to avoid any hurt feelings.

Freya, who returned to Downing Street after going missing for three years, is thought to an altogether tougher and more street-wise predator.

Lethargic: Larry prepares to ambush a mouse, but misses. He finally made his first 'confirmed kill' after six months in the job

Paw prowler: Larry was recruited last February to rid No 10 of its rodent problem, but swiftly earned a reputation for napping rather than ratting

Larry finally made his first kill last month in what has been a barren year for the five-year-old.

Larry was recruited last February to rid No 10 of its rodent problem, but swiftly earned a  reputation for napping rather than ratting.

Olly Grender, deputy director of communications at No 10, tweeted: ‘Just arrived at work. Larry the cat sitting proudly outside No 10 front door with a dead mouse next to him.’

She added: ‘Contrary to popular belief Larry is not a tart for the cameras and moved.’

In June, he was photographed soaking up the sunshine in the middle of Downing Street.

But he soon found himself hoisted up by a police protection officer and dumped unceremoniously by No 11, where David and Samantha Cameron live.

Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, was hailed as a ‘good ratter’ and having ‘a high chase-drive and hunting instinct’ when he first arrived in Downing Street.

But his career has, until now, been less than successful. Indeed, last year a photographer caught him as he pounced for a mouse – and missed.

Larry's life was turned upside down in June when Mr Osborne's long-lost cat Freya was found safe and well, raising concerns that a turf war may break out.

Freya was just a few months old when she went missing from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill home three years ago.

Mr Osborne, wife Frances and their two young children Luke and Liberty searched the streets of West London and put up ‘lost’ posters, but to no avail.

They gave up hope long before moving into Downing Street last year, assuming the cat had got lost – or worse, been run over.

So they transferred their affections to the family budgie, Gibson, named after RAF Dambusters hero Guy Gibson, and two goldfish.

But earlier this year, Frances, an author, received a phone call telling her Freya was alive and well.

She had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill house, lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters.
