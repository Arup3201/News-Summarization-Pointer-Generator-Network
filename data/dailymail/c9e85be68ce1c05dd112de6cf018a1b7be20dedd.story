Two members of the Wisconsin National Guard have been removed from funeral duty following an incident early this year when a photo appeared on social media sites showing soldiers joking around  an empty, flag-draped casket.

The group photograph, taken at an Arkansas training facility, sparked backlash online where members of Facebook and military chat rooms condemned it for being disrespectful.

The picture appeared on an Instagram account belonging to Specialist Terry Harrison, who received death threats over it, according to the National Guard.

The Wisconsin National Guard has announced that Specialist Terry Harrison, together with Sergeant Luis Jimenez, have been permanently removed from funeral honors detail over the photo taken in February

Now three months after the incident, the Wisconsin National Guard has announced that Harrison, together with Sergeant Luis Jimenez, have been permanently removed from funeral 
honors detail, reports the Army Times.

Although Harrison and Jimenez will no longer be part of the 
funeral team, they will continue to serve in the Guard, said Major Paul 
Rickert.

Sergeant Jimenez hadn't taken part in the photo, but had been suspended in the wake of the scandal after he attempted to defend his subordinate.

Rickert said 
the internal investigation into the social media incident is now complete 
but it’s against the Wisconsin National Guard’s policy to share details 
on any disciplinary actions.

Outrage: More than 900 military families complained about the inappropriate pictures and comments

Although the offending photo, which showed a group of soldiers hugging, pulling faces and making peace signs around a coffin, was quickly taken down it had already been shared on other social media sites.

A caption under the original photo read: 'We put the FUN in funeral - your fearless honor guard from various states'.

In a second picture, complaints were made about attending an outside funeral in winter, with a post that read: 'It's so damn cold out ... why have a funeral outside!? Somebody's getting a jacked up flag.'

Several military families were hurt by the disrespectful nature of the photo, and more than 900 contacted the guard to ask for the soldiers responsible to be disciplined.

'It
 was like somebody slapped me in the face. I've never in my life seen 
such disrespect for the fallen or the families,' Judy Vincent, whose son, Scott, died in Iraq in 2004, said. 

The mother, from Poteau, Oklahoma, added: 'It raises questions in your mind. What did they think of me, and was my loved one treated with disrespect?'

Suspended: Terry Harrison, who has been removed from funeral duty, received several death threats

Miguel 
Riley, a Kansas soldier wrote on Facebook: 'As the [non-comissioned officer in charge] for the honor guard of my unit on the active duty side, I am completely disgusted to see this.'

Major Paul Rickert, the Wisconsin National Guard's public 
affairs director, said he was appalled by the offensive photos and comments.

'A

 military funeral is the final show of respect for our veterans and 
their families, and we take that solemn duty very seriously,' Major 
Rickert told ABC 19, adding that the photo and comments didn't appear 
to meet the values the guard is expected to uphold.

But Jimenez, Harrison’s supervisor, defended the photo, writing on a social media site, 'she isn’t disrespecting anyone.

'It’s actually a selfless commitment she has made. These practice sessions are very long. It’s good to let loose a little. When your job constantly asked you to be serious. And no there’s no one in the casket.'

Major General Donald Dunbar, the Wisconsin adjutant general, added: 'We expect all of our soldiers and airmen to live by a core set of values, in word and deed.'
