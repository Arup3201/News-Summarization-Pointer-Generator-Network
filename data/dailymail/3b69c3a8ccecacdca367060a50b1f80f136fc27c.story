A woman who works for Fox Sports has called for a change in the NFL and sports media as a whole in light of how the Ray Rice incident has been handled.

Katie Nolan, a digital correspondent who hosts web series No Filter, says in a new video that instead of boycotting the NFL for its delayed reaction to the football player's heinous actions, we should fight back.

'It's time for women to have a seat at the big boy table and not where their presence is a gimmick or a concept,' she says. 'Just a person who happens to have breasts offering their opinion on the sports they love and the topics they know.'

Speaking out: Katie Nolan (pictured), a digital correspondent for Fox Sports, has called for a change in the NFL and sports media as a whole in light of how the Ray Rice incident has been handled

Shake-up: 'It’s time for women to have a seat at the big boy table and not where their presence is a gimmick or a concept,' she says

Katie begins the video by explaining how much of a football fan she is, and how it is hard for her to reconcile her passion for the sport with her recent disapproval of the NFL.

'All this Ray Rice stuff has put me in an uncomfortable position. How do I reconcile my values and beliefs with my love for a sport that has an ongoing issue with domestic violence?' she says.

'How do I support a commissioner who needed to SEE a video of a man punching a woman in the face in order to realize it's unacceptable?'

Then she explains that a simple boycott would not be practical, since not enough fans would follow through for it to make a significant difference.

She adds: 'More likely, a boycott would just remove the critical thinkers from the NFL conversation and leave the league to continue making billions of dollars with even less accountability.'

Challenge: Katie's video has had 200,000 views. 'The truth is the NFL will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to doesn't. I'm ready when you are, Fox,' she says

Instead, Katie calls for a change in the sports media industry, so that women have more of a say in the decisions made and the conversations had.

'Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines, and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,' she states.

'And, while the Stephen A Smiths, Mike Cairns, Dan Patricks and Keith Olbermanns of the world get to weigh in on the issues of the day, we just smile and throw to commercial.

Contradiction: 'All this Ray Rice stuff has put me in an uncomfortable position. How do I reconcile my values and beliefs with my love for a sport that has an ongoing issue with domestic violence?' she says

'It’s time for the conversation to change or at least those participating in the conversation.'

The video, which was posted on Tuesday, has had nearly 200,000 views.

Many people have taken to the comments section to voice their support and agreement. 

'I've been an avid fan since 2006 and have a dream one day to be an NFL announcer, but after everything that has taken place over these past 6 months, I'm in total agreement,' wrote one person.

Agreement: 'Until [Roger] Goodell [pictured] resigns or is fired, I refuse to watch another NFL game. It's a complete disgrace seeing how much of a monopoly this league truly is,' commented one person on the video

'Until [Roger] Goodell resigns or is fired, I refuse to watch another NFL game this year. It's a complete disgrace seeing how much of a monopoly this league truly is... A statement must be made that this s*** won't be tolerated.'

Katie concludes her video with a call for NFL fans to fight for change in the sports media industry. 

'Because the truth is the NFL will never respect women and their opinions as long as the media it answers to doesn't,' she says. 'I'm ready when you are, Fox.'
