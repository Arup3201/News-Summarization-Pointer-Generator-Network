Apple's iPhone has been slammed for being 'the technical equivalent of a polo shirt' or a pair of Nike sneakers.

Tech writer Rob Walker, a reformed Apple-lover, claims that after six years in existence, the popular smartphone is now anything but cool, but has instead become 'common.'

'And I mean that in the sense of "not distinguished; not of superior excellence; ordinary," per definition 4 in my Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary: Deluxe Second Edition,' he writes, adding 'I'll stop short of citing definition 7: "not refined; low; coarse."'

Polo shirt: Tech writer Rob Walker, a reformed Apple-lover, claims the popular smartphone has become 'common' in its six years in existence

In an article in Yahoo Tech, Walker, who recently switched to a HTC One smartphone, said the iPhone, independent of Apple, has become a brand unto itself.

'(Switching from Apple has) made it easier for me to recognize that the iPhone is, in fact, a totally bourgeois device: The iPhone has become, in its six short years, the technological equivalent of Polo shirt,' he writes.

'(The brand) has long since crossed over from "cool" (meaning something embraced by a minority that thinks of itself as having elite taste) to "acceptable," meaning it's a sort of cultural default, like a Polo shirt or Nike sneakers.'

He claims that the iPhone is 'the brand for people who don't want to think all that hard about what brand they are buying, and just want whatever everybody else will accept without question.'

Walker's observations come after a U.S. trade agency said it is banning imports of Apple's iPhone 4 after finding the device violates a patent held by rival Samsung Electronics.

Banned: The iPhone 4, seen here on the right, along with the older model, the 3GS on the left, cannot be imported to the U.S. anymore, a trade panel ruled Tuesday

Because the phone is assembled in China, the import would end Apple's ability to sell new iPhone 4 devices in the U.S.

The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington issued a final ruling on Tuesday in Samsung's suit against Apple.

The panel issued a limited import ban and
a cease-and-desist order for AT&T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone 
3GS, iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G. The versions targeted are more than a year 
old but still solid sellers, Reuters reported.

President Obama has 60 days to invalidate the order. Apple can also appeal the ruling.

Samsung and Apple are engaged in a global legal battle over their smartphones, with Apple arguing that Samsung and its Android phones copy vital features of the iPhone.

Samsung is fighting back with its own complaints.

The iPhone 4 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iPhone still being made.

It's the second bad court ruling for Apple in as many weeks.

Not for sale: The ruling also states the iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G cannot be imported as well because they violate a patent held by Samsung

A preliminary class settlement which 
agrees to pay $53 million in refunds to iPhone and iPod Touch customers 
for voiding their warranties was filed on Tuesday by Apple Inc in the 
District Court of Northern California in San Francisco.

The
settlement would refund up to $200 to each customer who was denied 
repairs or replacement under warranty of their iPhone or iPod because a 
small red strip located on the outside of the device indicated that they
had been in contact with water.

Jeffrey Fazio, an attorney representing two of the four representatives of the class action, told ABC News that Apple refused to honor standard warranties and AppleCare Protection Plans if a white indicator strip near the headphone or charging jacks had turned pink or red.

But 3M,the company that makes the strip (called 'Liquid Submersion Indicators') said humidity alone could have caused the color of strips to turn pink or even red.

This meant that a customer who took an iPhone or iPad for repair would have their warranty voided if the liquid indicator strip was red - even if it had never been in contact with water.
