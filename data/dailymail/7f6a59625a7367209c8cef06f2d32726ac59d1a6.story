Rene Meulensteen has warned his former club Manchester United they cannot afford to underestimate Chelsea even if  Diego Costa is not fit enough to play in Sunday's clash at Old Trafford.

The Spain striker has made a superb start to life at Stamford Bridge and has scored nine goals in seven Premier League appearances despite suffering from an ongoing hamstring problem, which ruled him out of the Blues' last two matches.

The hamstring injury, coupled with a virus, has made Costa a major doubt for Sunday's match, although manager Jose Mourinho said the forward has 'a little chance' of playing.

Former Fulham boss Rene Meulensteen has warned Manchester United not to focus too much on Costa

Meulensteen had two spells at United as a coach and says Chelsea have plenty of other attacking threats 

But Meulensteen, who had two spells as a coach at  United, insists Louis van Gaal's team must not focus too much on whether he plays or not.

The former Fulham boss told talkSPORT 'I think Chelsea have got enough of an attacking threat to throw something at them even if Costa is not playing.

'Of course, if Costa was playing and he hit the ground running, you could put money on him that he's going to get a chance and he will probably score.

'But Chelsea have still got enough attacking options even without Costa.'
