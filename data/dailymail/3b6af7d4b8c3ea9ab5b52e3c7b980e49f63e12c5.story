West Ham United have been rocked by news their main shirt sponsor Alpari has entered into insolvency.

The foreign exchange broker is one of the largest casualties of Thursday's frantic trading of the Swiss franc.

The news raises fears over the continuing validity of the deals between the east London club and the City firm, while the Hammers insist they already in 'advanced discussions with potential new shirt sponsors for next year'. 

West Ham's main shirt sponsor Alpari, a foreign exchange broker, has gone into insolvency

Alpari have been West Ham's main shirt sponsor since February 2013 when they signed a deal worth £3million

A club statement read:'West Ham United has enjoyed a good working relationship with Alpari (UK) Limited since 2011 and is therefore saddened by today's news that it has entered into insolvency. The Club would like to offer its sympathies to any Alpari staff affected by the announcement, particularly those that have worked closely with us over the past few years.

'The Board would like to reassure supporters that Alpari (UK) Limited's situation will have no impact on West Ham United. The Club remains in a strong financial position and just last month published accounts showing record revenues and a group profit of £10.3m before tax.

'The Club has received huge interest and is already in advanced discussions with potential new shirt sponsors for next year.' 

Alpari became the Hammers' shirt sponsor in a deal worth £3m a year in February 2013 – which was later renewed for a further three years.

The company also signed a three-year deal to sponsor the West Stand at the 35,016-capacity stadium in Upton Park, and the club are in discussions to rename it.

A statement on the company's website said: 'The recent move on the Swiss franc caused by the Swiss National Bank's unexpected policy reversal of capping the Swiss franc against the euro has resulted in exceptional volatility and extreme lack of liquidity.

'This has resulted in the majority of clients sustaining losses which has exceeded their account equity. Where a client cannot cover this loss, it is passed on to us.

'This has forced Alpari (UK) Limited to confirm that it has entered into insolvency. Retail client funds continue to be segregated in accordance with FCA rules.'

The Hammers were delighted when the deal was first announced, vice chairman Karren Brady told the club's official website: 'We are enthused and excited to enter into this new partnership with Alpari.

'This landmark deal, along with a host of other significant strides forward our business has made recently, is yet further evidence of the growth we have witnessed and I can only see things getting better.'

At least two brokerage firms say they have gone bust after suffering losses on the Swiss franc's massive surge this week, one of the most acute moves seen by a major trading currency in decades. 

Alpari had also signed a three-year deal to sponsor West Ham's West Stand at Upton Park
