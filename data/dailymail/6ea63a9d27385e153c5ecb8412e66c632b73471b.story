Superfit Sarah Davies is on a mission to break down the stereotype of a typical beauty queen - and she's using brute force to do it.

The stunning 21 year-old has qualified for the Commonwealth Games as a weightlifter - while also competing in beauty pageants.

Sarah, a full-time PE teacher, from Leeds says she 
is passionate about changing the image of women by taking part in two 
very contrasting roles.

She said: 'I hope that because I'm so far from the stereotypical beauty queen, young people will realise that the way to get the body you want isn't through starving yourself.

'I also like that one breaks the stereotype of the other, as people think female weightlifters should be really butch looking and beauty queens should be tall, blonde and rake thin.

'It shows you don't have to be manly 
to enjoy the sport and you don't have to be skinny to be a beauty queen.
 They're both great fun and anyone can do it.

'I hope that my training as a weightlifter will help people realise that beauty

Sarah Davies, who competes as a beauty queen has now landed the chance to enter the commonwealth games as a weighlifter

pageants have come a long way since 
the 1970s because I think outside of the pageant community, a lot of 
people think they are still really outdated.

'Since I started, my arms hardly look any different because you use the strength in your legs and bum.

'I also hope that my success in pageants will encourage more girls to take up weightlifting.

'It's very important in pageants now to have a healthy body and active

lifestyle and not to have a stick-thin, starved figure we used to see."

Sarah,
 a former Miss Leeds, qualified for this summer's Commonwealth Games in 
Glasgow after totalling 190kg with a 83kg snatch and 107kg clean and 
jerk in the English Weightlifting Championships.

Sarah Davies says she wants to challenge the perceptions of beauty queens

 on March 9.

Sarah, from Leeds, already holds the regional Miss Preston Galaxy title and winning the England crown would see her go to the final in America in August.

Sarah trained as a gymnast from the age of five and got into weightlifting first, thanks to boyfriend Jack Oliver, who came 10th in the sport during the London Olympics.

She said: 'It was September 2011 and Jack suggested I go to the gym and try some weightlifting for a bit of fun and that I may be quite good at it because of my gymnastics background.

'During my first ever training sessions I managed a scrappy looking 30kg snatch and an even worse looking 40kg clean and jerk.

'I'm quite a competitive person and I like being able to challenge and beat myself, therefore weightlifting was perfect for me and I fell in love with it straight away.'

She might seem a big softie here but Sarah's set to become a weightlifting champ

Her first foray onto the catwalk came in March 2012 when she won Miss Leeds as a student in the city.

At the moment she spends 20 hours a week training for weightlifting while also preparing for the required charity events in the Miss Galaxy England event.

Sarah is currently working as a supply teacher at Temple Moor High School in Leeds, West Yorks.

She added: 'It can be hectic trying to fit everything but I am lucky that the timing of the school day means I can fit everything in at the best time for me.

'Schools are usually supportive as they like to have an elite athlete as a teacher to be a role model to the pupils.'

Sarah said her weightlifting helped her land the Miss Leeds title as she had something different to offer, and other girls in the competition come to her for advice on exercise.

She said: 'Weightlifting has toned up my body and I'm in much better shape now I've been training.

'I think that's really helped with the beauty pageants I've been in, especially with the swim suit rounds.

'I absolutely love doing both and it's great that they work well together, even if it is an unusual mix.'

Bosses at British Weightlifting have also recruited Sarah to raise the profile of the sport.
