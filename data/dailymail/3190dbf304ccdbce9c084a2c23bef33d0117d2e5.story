A 24 stone father who lived on on pies and doughnuts has lost an amazing eleven and a half stone.

Alwyn Beckles, 44, used to tip the scales at almost 25st and had a life-threatening 54in waist.

But now he is half the man he used to be after he was 'volunteered' for slimming classes with his stepdaughter.

Â 24 stone father Alwyn Beckles has lost eleven and a half stone after joining his daughter's slimming club and ditching his favourite pies and doughnuts

Alwyn, of Burton Gardens, Brierfield, Lancashire, started Slimming World classes in February 2012.

Mr Beckles, a father-of-two and stepfather of six, said: 'My stepdaughter Sophie said she wanted to start the classes to lose weight before a holiday but she wanted someone to go with her.

'My wife said she hadn't got the time but I know someone who has - and I was volunteered for it! I knew it was time to do something about my weight if I wanted to see my children grow up so it was good timing really.

'I changed my diet first, I didn't really feel comfortable exercising or going to a gym until I'd lost the first five stone.

Alwyn said: 'I changed my diet first, I didn't really feel comfortable exercising or going to a gym until I'd lost the first five stone.'

'I eat healthily now. I used to eat crisps, cakes and doughnuts as well as pies, now it is a lot of fruit and veg.

'At
first I thought I'll be thin but I'll be miserable without the cakes, 
but after I started to lose weight I didn't feel hungry and I thought 
'this is great'.

Mr 
Beckles, whose wife Amanda, 38, has also lost a lot of weight, weighed 
in last week at 13st 3oz and now has a 34in waist. he was named Man 
of the Year at the Slimming World group in Nelson.

Mr
Beckles, a service engineer for Herbert Retail, said: 'I feel more 
confident now and more energetic. I never thought I could lose this much
weight.'

Alwyn, holding up one of his old supersized shirts said: 'At first I thought I'll be thin but I'll be miserable without the cakes, but after I started to lose weight I didn't feel hungry and I thought 'this is great'.
