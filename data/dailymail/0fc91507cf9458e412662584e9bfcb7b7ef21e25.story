She is not impressed by the unrealistic female characters in many Hollywood films but that hasn’t stopped Keira Knightley earning a fortune by playing them.

At least the irony is not lost on the English actress, 29, who branded herself a ‘complete hypocrite’ for demanding better role models for women while also posing for fashion magazines often criticised for providing the opposite.

The Oscar-nominee – who has appeared on the cover of titles including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle – accepted her double standards in an interview with a Sunday newspaper.

'Hypocrite': Keira Knightley prefers working on a women-led production because 'then you don¿t have to do this loveable, soft version of what the female sex has to be'

She told The Sunday Times she thinks many women feel no affinity with the majority of female characters, saying: ‘My friend was saying she loved 1970s movies, and we both realised that’s because we see ourselves as the main guys in them.

‘When I watched The Godfather, I was Al Pacino I wasn’t his f****** wife. It’s interesting that there’s still this funny construction of femininity’.

She had made this comments despite the fact she found fame through hits such as The Pirates of the Caribbean series, King Arthur and this year’s Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which arguably contain the very roles she is criticising.

Knightley, who is married to James Righton, 30, of band The Klaxons, said the problem stems from the low number of female directors working in mainstream films.

However, she also admitted that the predominance of male roles in films comes from the fact that ‘women will go and see a male lead, but it’s difficult to get a guy to see a film that is seen as girly’. 

She added that it is a problem that often concerns her, saying: ‘I think when you recognise it’s strange that half the population doesn’t have the same voice as the other half, and there’s minorities within minorities that don’t have a voice and should have it, it does make you go, “Ha. This is interesting”’.

She said she prefers working on a women-led production because, ‘then you don’t have to do this loveable, soft version of what the female sex has to be. It also allows men to understand women, as opposed to them being something pink and fluffy’.

However, pushed on what she would do to fix the problem, she admitted she didn’t know where to begin. She said: ‘No idea. I wish I knew. Keep on having conversations and somebody intelligent will go, “Eureka”’.

The actress – who earned £1.5million last year but claimed to live on only £30,000 – has been working her way up the Hollywood A-list since first coming to public attention in 2002’s Bend It Like Beckham.

She has gone on to win top modelling contracts – she has worked with Chanel since 2008 – and appear in blockbusters such as this year’s Jack Ryan film, believed to be the first of a franchise and based on the best-selling novels.

However, she said in the candid interview that she is so disenchanted with the type of film it represents that she couldn’t manage to sit through even half of the movie, which grossed £80million worldwide.
