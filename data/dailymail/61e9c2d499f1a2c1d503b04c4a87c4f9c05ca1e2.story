Nigel Farage is mounting a drive to recruit UKIP supporters from ‘white, working-class’ Labour voters who feel abandoned by Ed Miliband’s party.

The UKIP leader – whose surge in the opinion polls has been put down to defections by disenchanted Conservative supporters – will unveil his new strategy in a party political broadcast next Sunday.

The film will show his deputy, Paul Nuttall, touring Labour’s inner-city heartlands asking locals if they  agree with UKIP policies such as withdrawing from the European Union – and being given an enthusiastic reception.

Mr Farage’s strategists say the  traditional dividing lines between the parties are becoming blurred, with Labour supporters just as likely to sympathise with the call for tighter restrictions on immigration.

Although the broadcast, to be shown on Channel 4, was filmed on Monday, two days before the Woolwich murder, it will revive the debate about the political impact of the social tensions that can exist in some urban areas where growing ethnic minority communities co-exist with long- established populations of white  British locals.

Following UKIP’s dramatic breakthrough in the local elections earlier this month – Mr Farage won 23 per cent of the vote, just two per cent behind the Conservatives and five per cent behind Mr Miliband – Labour backbenchers have joined their Tory counterparts in calling for action to tackle the UKIP threat.

John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, 
Nottinghamshire, said his party should ‘wake up and get real on 
immigration’, adding: ‘Too many employers are underpaying British 
workers and using cheap labour from abroad.’

The UKIP film was produced by Linda 
McDougall – the wife of Grimsby Labour MP Austin Mitchell – who makes 
the Channel 4 broadcasts for all the political parties. Last night, Ms 
McDougall said she found the new UKIP strategy ‘fascinating’.

‘With my non-political producer’s hat on, I thought it was very interesting that UKIP thinks there are votes to be had from the white working classes – although they don’t express it in quite those terms – who feel that they have been failed by Labour.

‘Everywhere we went in this very Labour, inner-city London area, people said to Nuttall, “You’ve got my vote.” And they all, without exception, said they wanted to leave the EU.

‘I said to Austin that it was like the 1980s, under Thatcher, when everyone would come up to us and say, “You’ve got my vote.” ’

Yesterday, as if to emphasise the point, a Labour councillor on Mr Mitchell’s own turf defected to UKIP.

Lincolnshire councillor Jane Bramley said: ‘I couldn’t stay with Labour any longer. I agree with most of the policies that UKIP have and I think it is a fairer party.’

Mr Farage recently pledged to ‘gun for Labour’ because of Mr Miliband’s ‘abject’ refusal to back a nationwide in/out ballot on the EU.
