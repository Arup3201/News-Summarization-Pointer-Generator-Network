Renowned: Rupert Brooke wrote celebrated poems such as The Soldier

The myth paints him as an Edwardian hero and a romantic symbol for a lost generation.

But a new book about Rupert Brooke’s affair with suffragette Phyllis Gardner reveals the shocking truth about the poet a century after his death.

He was a celebrity of his age, lauded by Winston Churchill as among ‘England’s noblest sons’, and described by WB Yeats as ‘the handsomest young man in England’.

But the writer of celebrated poems such as The Soldier is now shown to have been a fierce opponent of women’s rights who privately declared, ‘All women are beasts’.

The book, The Second I Saw You: The True Love Story of Rupert Brooke and Phyllis Gardner, draws on forgotten letters between the pair, as well as Gardner’s unpublished memoir.

Brooke died from septicaemia in April 1915 as a Royal Navy reserve officer on his way to take part in the Gallipoli landings after a mosquito bite became infected.

He was just 27 and the book is being released by The British Library to mark the centenary of his passing.

Gardner and Brooke met when he was 25 and she was 22 and they set opposite each other on a train to Cambridge. 

Gardner wrote in her journal that neither spoke to the other but she spent the time sketching him and added: ‘I drew him steadily all the way to Cambridge and the more I drew him the better I liked him.’

She was the daughter of eminent archaeologist Ernest Arthur Gardner and it was her mother, an amateur poet who longed to be a member of literary circles, who encouraged the affair. 

The young Gardner soon became infatuated, writing the poet was: ‘The Alpha and Omega of my life’.

Brooke seems to have been awkward and unsure in his feelings but did compose the poem Beauty and Beauty for her. However, after initial trysts, including night time skinny dipping Bryon’s Pool in Grantchester, the affair turned cold.

It was under this strain that Brooke’s true feelings began to surface, with him declaring: ‘All women are beasts! And they want a vote - but they’ll never get it,’ an insult to Gardner’s suffragette activities.

The poet’s repressed sexuality has been widely discussed by academics and Gardner writes how her lover, who she described as boring in bed, finally managed to express his opinions on sexuality.

He said: ‘There are two ways of loving, the normal and the wandering. The normal is to love and marry one person, the wandering is to take what one wants where one finds it, to be friends here, lovers there, married there, to spend a day with one, a week with others’.

Gardner’s mother finally decided to end the relationship and Brooke fled abroad. He died two years later. 

Gardner finished her memoir in 1918 but it was never published. She died from breast cancer in 1939 and, nine years later, the documents were given to the British Museum by his sister, Delphis.

She was not revealed to have been his lover until 2000, when the letters and memoir were first unearthed by the British Library.
