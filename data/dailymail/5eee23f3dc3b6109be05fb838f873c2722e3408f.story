One World Trade Center may have nabbed the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, but a new structure isn't far behind.

The Nordstrom Tower, at 227 W. 57th Street, will be the tallest residential structure in the world when it is completed in 2018 - when it will measure just one foot shorter than One World Trade Center.

New information leaked to YIMBY reveals its dizzying measurements, showing that the glass-fronted building will rise to an eye-watering 1,775 feet at its spire, while the One World Trade Center measures a symbolic 1,776 feet tall.

In fact, the roof of the Nordstrom Tower will overtake One World Trade Center as plans show its facade will stretch until 1,479 feet above street level.

in New York, measures up to the world's tallest buildings

One World Trade Center's roof stops at 1,368 feet - which is the same height as the north tower of the original World Trade Center.

Nordstrom's staggering height means it will push past other record-setting structures, including the 1,450-foot World One Tower in Mumbai, which will also be a residential structure once it's complete.

'The new height details will result in 
several superlatives,' YIMBY explained.

'Manhattan will finally retake the "tallest roof" 
in the United States from Chicago's Willis Tower, which stands 1,451', 
and 225 West 57th Street will become the tallest residential building in
 the entire world, surpassing both 432 Park Avenue and Mumbaiâ€™s World 
One Tower.'

Once it is completed, the building will have a giant seven-floor Nordstrom department store on the lower levels and residences above.

When it's finished, the Nordstrom Tower will become the world's tallest residential building at 1,775 ft. How does this compare with other structures around the world?

1. Burj Khalifa, Dubai: 2,717 ft (828m)

2. Shanghai Tower, China: 2,073 ft (632m)

3. Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel, Mecca, Saudi Arabia: 1,971 ft (601m)

4. One World Trade Center, New York: 1,776 ft (541.3m)

5. Taipei 101, Taiwan: 1,670 ft (501m)

The most recent permits, which were partially approved on July 1st, reveal that the building could reach more than 1.2 million square feet.

It will stand more than 300 feet taller than any other man-made objects in Midtown and will likely cast a few shadows on Central Park, which is near its base.

The 
completion of 225 West 57th Street is slated for 2018, and is one of 
seven super-slim luxury high-rises currently under construction in 
Midtown.

Another, the 1,350 foot 111 West 57th Street building. will be higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck once it is finished.

Last year, a study conducted by the Municipal Art Society (MAS) sparked concern that the super tall buildings would leave park visitors in the shadows.

The study found that on December 21, the winter solstice, the park will hit its darkest point, with shadows extending 20 blocks into the park - reaching the Lake and Ramble.

In their report, the Municipal Art Society proposes a re-appraisal of zoning codes to ensure that there's more oversight and public involvement in making this new breed of skyscrapers.

Advances
 in skyscraper engineering mean these buildings can be constructed super
 slim - about two townhouses wide in some cases - occupying plots of 
land originally suited for 40-story buildings.

It has been designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, which was behind Dubai's massive Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest 
building in the world at 2,717 feet.
