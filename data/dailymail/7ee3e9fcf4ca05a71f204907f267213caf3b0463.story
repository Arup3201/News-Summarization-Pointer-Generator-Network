Rising numbers of students are likely to receive financial help from their grandparents, according to a survey.

Three per cent of grandparents have already helped to fund a relative’s university fees and this is set to rise to 13 per cent in the next decade.

The think-tank ILC-UK commissioned the survey of 2,072 Britons with equity release firm Key Retirement Solutions.

They said this means one in eight grandparents – 1.7million over-55s – believe they face helping with tuition fees while meeting their own living costs in retirement.

The survey also found that three in four over-55s think they will need to dip into savings to help their student grandchildren in some way.

Dean Mirfin, of Key Retirement Solutions, said: 'The numbers of grandparents providing financial assistance for university tuition is set to rocket from current levels as the implications of the maximum £9,000-a-year tuition fees become clear.

'With finances for the over-55s under 
strain from falling annuity rates and historically low savings rates, 
taking on extra commitments requires careful thought and planning.'

A report from last year, which interviewed 1,000 young people, also found that grandparents are a common solution for getting on to the property ladder.

It found that one in ten people had asked their grandparents for help when buying their first home.

The survey, by housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, also revealed that many young people feared they would have to live with their parents into their 40s and 50s because it would be so difficult to afford homes of their own.
