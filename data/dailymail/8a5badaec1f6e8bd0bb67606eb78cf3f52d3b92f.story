A Georgia mother walked out of a Panera Bread restaurant earlier this month after an assistant manager asked her to take off her developmentally disabled daughter’s squeaking orthopedic shoes because they were 'bothering someone'.

Two year-old Emma Duke suffers from an illness that makes it difficult for her to walk correctly, requiring special shoes to help her along her way.

An orthopedist prescribed footwear for better ankle support that squeak when Emma walks heel to toe, allowing her to realize when she's walking properly and when she isn't.

Her mother, Catherine Duke, said she left one of the chain's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, crying on January 2 after the staff member told her the noise her daughter's shoes were creating were disrupting other diners, according to Opposing Views.

Emma Duke, 2, only learned to walk at 23 months after an orthopedist prescribed her special shoes that squeak when she walks heel to toe, allowing her to realize when she is walking correctly

An employee at the family's local Panera Bread in Savannah asked Emma's parents to remove the girl's special shoes because they were disrupting other patrons

Mother Catherine Duke (right) was so upset by the situation she walked out of the restaurant crying and filed an official complaint with Panera Bread corporate

Panera Bread corporate held a meeting with Catherine Duke over the incident, along with the employee who unwittingly caused the drama, and offered to hold a fundraiser for Emma

'We weren’t welcome with the shoes - It was very blatant,' she told told WTOC on Jan. 4.

'It was very hurtful, and I left the store crying, not a very good thing for a mom to feel like her child is being discriminated against.'

After filing a complaint about the incident, the corporate headquarters of Panera Bread got in touch with Duke and formally apologized.

She said the franchisee met with her personally and said 'that she and her family are always welcome at Panera and her concerns have been addressed'.

They held a meeting with the employee who erred and the manager of the restaurant.

The franchise also said they want to hold a fundraiser to help the Dukes pay Emma’s medical bills.

The family say the incident is now over that the employee who started the problem, who was apparently new to the job, did not realize what the mistake she was making

They are going to donate 50 per cent of the restaurant’s proceeds on a specific night.

'They’re very for children,' Duke said.

'This is just one of those things that happened in one of their cafes that they’re not proud of it.'

Panera Bread said in a statement that 'the last thing we would want to do is make anyone feel unwelcome'.

The restaurant said the assistant manager who approached Duke was new to her job.

'I don’t think she quite knew how to handle customers complaining about it,' Duke said.
