A beauty queen who beat the bulge and dropped four dress sizes has offered advice to others battling with their weight.

Nadina Knight, 24, the newly crowned Miss Northampton, was tipping the scales at 16 stone thanks to an unhealthy diet based on fast food and alcohol before an unflattering Facebook photo persuaded her to make a change.

The grim photos, taken on her 20th birthday, made her realise how much weight she had gained and a confrontation with her mother brought matters to a head.

Miss England 2012 finalist Nadina said: 'I was slim until about the age of 16, when I started to have control over my own diet, I put on a little bit of weight.

'Then I went to university, I had even more control over what I ate and my weight just got out of hand.

'The quantity of food and drinking I was doing was too much.

'It wasn't until my 20th birthday, when I saw pictures of myself on Facebook, and my mum mentioned it, that I realised I had put on so much.

'My mum was concerned because she is diabetic and she expressed concerns about my size.'

Nadina, who has since slimmed to a petite size 8 added: 'I had been caught off guard and there was just so much of me and I think that was when I thought 'my mum is right.

'The first thing I did was search Google for healthy living tips. I didn't want to diet like so many of my friends had done, I just wanted to lose the weight in a healthy and sustainable way.'

Binge drinking: Industrial quantities of booze made Nadina pile on the pounds and also affected her skin

The gym was once an alien place for the previously overwight Nadina, whose diet consisted of greasy takeaways

Having shed four dress sizes, pretty Nadina, who had previously entered the Miss England competition twice before without success, tried again and this time succeeded.

This she puts down to her healthier lifestyle, which includes small changes such as having skimmed milk, wholemeal bread and cutting out fizzy drinks and alcohol.

She said: 'It was nothing drastic, but I felt this was the best way. So over the next three years it gradually fell off.

'I also go to the gym about three times a week. I won't ever let myself get to that stage again.'

And her Miss Northampton title isn't the only pageant title she's won since fighting off the flab.

Last year, Nadina, who is of Mauritian decent, won the title of the Mauritius Publicity Queen and claimed the first prize: a six day luxury trip to the island over Christmas.

Coincidentally it just so happened to be her great-grandmother's 100th birthday on Christmas Eve.

Nadina said: 'She was in so much shock. She hasn't seen me for 13 years so at first she didn't even recognise me.

'It was such an amazing trip. And being able to go for six days over Christmas, when her birthday fell on Christmas Eve, was so lucky, it was fate.'

Now Nadina is pursuing a singing career as well as working with Miss England.

What a difference! Now plump Nadina has become healthy, slim Nadina and Miss Northampton to boot

She said: 'The whole Miss England 
experience was incredible. I was with everyone for four days straight 
and you really start to become a family. I enjoyed myself so much.

'I made some great friends. The rumours you hear about beauty pageants being catty aren't true, everyone was really friendly. Once you're in, you're part of it forever.'

As for losing the weight, Nadina says she is more confident than she has ever been before.

She said: 'It has been bizarre after losing all of the weight. I look completely different and people who knew me then don't recognise me now.

'It has given me the confidence I didn't have before, I'm happier and most importantly I'm healthier which was my main goal.'

1. Swap white for brown: 'Ditch white carbohydrates in favour of wholemeal. Think brown bread, brown pasta and brown rice. This is such an easy rule to stick to and I noticed the difference almost immediately - less bloating and more energy.'

2. Don't skip meals: 'Three meals a day and plenty of water will stop you unnecessarily snacking. Try and eat things that will keep you fuelled longer in the mornings such as porridge or muesli with skimmed milk, then try a heavy salad or chicken and vegetables for lunch. This will enable you to eat lighter for dinner and resist the urge to snack.

3. Drinks count too: 'We often forget that what we are drinking is just as important as our food diet. Cut out fizzy drinks, drink plenty of water and herbal teas. Remember, everything in moderation - even fruit juice contains lots of sugar.'

4. Have fun: 'Don't jeopardise your social life, remember you can still pick healthy options when eating out. A favourite of mine is the Arrosto salad at Prezzo, packed full of artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and chicken and do remember alcohol can heavily contribute to weight gain (this was one of my biggest downfalls when I was at my heaviest) and can have a detrimental affect on your skin, liver and overall health.'

5. Stay clear of saturated fat: 'Saturated fats are a tough one for us all. We love a croissant in the morning or cheese and crackers after dinner but these create the fatty pockets we all hate. Instead enjoy good fats in moderation and try switching your regular cooking oil for olive oil.'

6. Stay active: 'An active lifestyle will keep you in shape but even if you're busy and feel you don't have time for the gym, try home-work outs. I am a huge fan of these and there is so much you can do.'

7. 10 minute ab work-outs: 'I try to do this every day! I use a different ab exercise for every two minutes of my 10 minute work-out. Plank and side plank is always a must for me, Bicycles to work your obliques, crunches to work your upper abs, full sit ups to work everything and leg raises to work your lower abs.'

8. Keep glutes and hamstrings toned: 'Try leg lifts. On all fours, lift your legs to a 90 degree angle. Try doing sets on each leg alternating eight times on each. Keep your quads toned too - try lunges, which are easy to do at home and a great exercise for toned thighs.

9. Inner thighs and bum: 'To keep these toned I do 'Sumo' squats, which are your normal squat but with hands out in front and feet pointing outwards slightly. It's similar to the pli√© ballet move but with your bottom out rather than tucked in.

10. Running: 'I make excuses all the time about this one but it's so easy to go for a quick run around your local area. Even a quick 10 minute mile will get you feeling fresh and motivated and burn fat.'
