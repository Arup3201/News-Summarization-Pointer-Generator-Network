London Irish full-back Tom Homer has been ruled out for at least two months because of a grade two knee sprain.

Homer sustained the damage after only seven minutes of Saturday's 20-15 Aviva Premiership defeat by Harlequins at Twickenham and will return in mid-November at the earliest.

The setback comes after 24-year-old missed the majority of last season with a groin problem.

'It is disappointing for Tom and the club,' London Irish director of rugby Brian Smith said.

'He has had a great pre-season and was champing at the bit to be back playing.'

The exiles endured a difficult afternoon at Twickenham. They were 20-6 down at half time having not even made it into the Quins 22 and, despite improving in the second half, Brian Smith's side failed to make up the defecit.
