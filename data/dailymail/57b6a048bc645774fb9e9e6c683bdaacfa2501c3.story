PC Mark Ellis is unlikely to catch many miscreants on his DIY police bike – but at least it raises a smile.

The pedalling PC has tarted up his ancient bike using blue flashing lights from an old firearms car and a whirling blue light from an old military police vehicle. 

He covered the frame in blue and white police-type checkers, and while it has a horn and not a siren, the bike does feature POLICE signs on the front and rear.

The suped-up ride even has a speed gun to catch unwary motorists- which is powered by a battery box at the back.

But with only three gears, PC Ellis admits he would have difficulty chasing anyone up hills.

While the sight of the officer on his souped-up wheels may fail to strike fear into many, he said the steed brought a smile to people on his beat in the market town of Haverhill in Suffolk.

Residents were stunned to see their local police officer cycle past on his DIY police bike with blue flashing lights

PC Ellis said: 'It's not what you call a normal bike. Because it was so old I thought 'let's do something offbeat.

'It's hard work to ride it, it's a bit of an old bone shaker. And because it's only got three gears a slight incline is a killer.

'Trust me to be posted in a town with a steep valley.'

The officer was given the bike when he first joined Suffolk Poluce in 1988 but it had been gathering dust until they were reunited last week.
