It appears that even the Queen's own bodyguard are not immune from absurd health and safety rules after these Household Cavalry troops were pictured wearing high visibility jackets on the streets of central London.

The photograph was taken in Kensington, close to Hyde Park where the Household Cavalry is based, and shows around half a dozen riders wearing the safety clothing as they rode along a busy street.

One onlooker said: 'It's bizarre and hardly very dignified for these soldiers. It's not like you can miss them anyway, they're on massive great horses and they're taking up a whole lane.'

The Household Cavalry is made up of the two most senior regiments of the British Army, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. The troops are garrisoned at Hyde Park Barracks, close to Buckingham Palace, and is part of the Household Division and is the Queen's official bodyguard.

Elf 'n' safety: These soldiers in the Household Cavalry were pictured wearing high-visibility jackets as they rode through central London, close to their Barracks in Hyde Park

An MoD spokesman said: 'The Highway Code states that â€œhorse riders should wear light coloured or fluorescent clothing in daylight and reflective clothing if riding at night or in poor visibility".

'The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) also states that high visibility clothing should be worn by horse riders.

'In addition to the advice issued,  the Commanding Officer expects all his soldiers and Officers to comply with this advice to ensure safety for both other road users and themselves.

'The Department takes the safety of all its employees seriously and would expect them to take all reasonable measures to ensure they are safe and secure in whatever activity they are undertaking be it horse riding or otherwise.'

Modern times have now caught up with tradition and RAF personnel were ordered to wear high-vis vests over their fatigues due to health and safety reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the Great Escape of Allied airmen and to honour 50 of them who were caught and executed

Yesterday airmen were ordered to wear
 high-visibility vests over their fatigues due to health and safety 
reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the daring escape.

The
 bright yellow jackets are being worn by 50 British Royal Air Force 
personnel as they march from the site of the Nazi prisoner camp to a war
 cemetery in western Poland to honour the fearless servicemen who were brutally executed during The Great Escape.

A source involved with the march said: 'It is common sense. And there are some really bad Polish drivers.'

One onlooker told The Sun: 'It's bonkers - they are trying to honour daring and secrecy by ticking all the health and safety boxes. Our war heroes would be turning in their graves.'

In four days, the British airmen 
are to walk more than 100 miles to the British war cemetery in Poznan, 
where the ashes of those executed were buried after the war.

Marek Lazarz, director of the Stalag 
Luft III Museum near Zagan, said the British group started in pouring 
rain from a monument marking the place where 76 prisoners of war 
emerged.

During
 observances this week, they have met two British former Stalag inmates,
 retired RAF airmen Andrew Weisman and Charles Clarke, who were held at 
the camp after the time of the Great Escape.

The plot became the inspiration 
behind the classic war film The Great Escape starring Hollywood legend 
Steve McQueen.

A group of about 250 prisoners, started 
to digging tunnels, in which they were going to escape the 59-acre site,
 which had five miles of perimeter fencing.

Time for a change? A mock-up of what the Horse Guards Parade would look like if they decided to wear a high-vis jacket over their red uniform

If the concept of wearing a high-vis jacket was deployed across all units it could look like this. Left, a patrol searching for IEDs and Taliban fighters and right, the Royal Guards at Buckingham Palace

Escape if he too had fallen victim to the health and safety zealots

More than 600 prisoners were involved 
in the construction of three tunnels - codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry - 
at the camp in the German Province of Lower Silesia, 100 miles southeast
 of Berlin.

Tom and Dick had to be abandoned with Harry becoming the focus of their escape route.

It was approximately 300ft long and 28ft deep.

Only 200 of the higher ranking 
captives, those who could speak German and had put a lot of work into 
digging the tunnels, would have time to escape in the plan.

But there was a series of problems on the night of the escape.

The main issue was that the Harry tunnel came up short and in close proximity to a guard tower.

The plan: 250 officers spent 11 months building Harry, a 300ft tunnel out of the camp in Zagan, Poland

The site 100 miles south of Berlin was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during World War Two

A commemorative stone has been laid over the track listing the names of the men who concocted the idea

As the 77th man exited the tunnel, 
they were spotted by a guard who alerted the rest of the camp and 73 of 
the escaped prisoners were captured. Fifty of those were shot.

An RAF spokesman said:  'There are 50 current serving RAF personnel currently walking towards Poznan, which is the final resting place for Sqn Ldr Roger Bushell, who was the mastermind for the Great Escape; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads, which are not closed to traffic, they are wearing hi-vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely.'
