Former Australian Workers Union official Bruce Wilson is currently before the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption in Sydney

A builder has told the royal commission into union corruption that Julia Gillard's ex-boyfriend, allegedly corrupt union official Bruce Wilson, paid for the renovations of her home in 1993.

Athol James, 84, said that he was paid by Julia Gillard for the renovations, who in turn was funded by cash payments from Mr Wilson, suggesting for the first time that there was a direct link between the former prime minister and the union funds.

Athol James told the commission that he began work on Ms Gillard's home in Abbotsford, Melbourne, in 1993 and through this met 'her male companion' whom he later came to know as Bruce Wilson.

'During the work I would deal with Ms Gillard in relation to any payment for the completed work,' Mr James said.

'I would give her the invoice. I am pretty certain she said she would get money from Bruce and pay me in the next few days. I'm certain she said Bruce was paying for it.'

Mr James replaced some doors and windows in the home between March and June 1993 at a cost of $6,040 according to invoices tendered in the commission.

In August a further invoice of $2,986 was submitted by Mr James' company for fencing and flooring at the home.

Mr James, 84, is also certain he 'saw Bruce hand Ms Gillard a large amount of cash on two occasions'.

'Ms Gillard said to me that as Bruce brought her the cash, she would pay me by cheque.

'When Bruce handed Ms Gillard the cash, she would write me a cheque.

'I was never paid in cash and I don't know what happened with the cash Bruce handed her.'

One of Mr Wilson's former employees, Wayne Hem, a researcher and librarian for the Australian Workers' Union, also told the commission today that Mr Wilson gave him $5,000 to deposit in Ms Gillard's account.

He testified today that after a night out in 1995, a 'scruffy' looking Mr Wilson called him into his office at the Victorian branch office of the Australian Workers' Union.

'He took a wad of notes out of his pocket and he wrote on a piece of paper a bank account number,' Mr Hem said in his witness statement.

'He handed me the cash and the piece of paper and asked me to deposit the cash.

'I looked at the paper, asked him to tell whose account it was, and handed him the piece of paper back so that he could write the details on the paper for me.

'He then wrote Julia Gillard on the piece of paper and handed it back to me.'

Bruce Wilson is the ex-boyfriend of Julia Gillard and allegedly made payments to her in the mid-90s

Mr Hem counted the money and deposited it at the Commonwealth Bank in Carlton before returning to the office, he told the commission.

Mr Wilson also gave an envelope, which Mr Hem assumed contained cash, to a painter at an Abbotsford house in Melbourne that was being renovated, Mr Hem testified today.

'About four weeks later I was talking to Bruce [Wilson] and he mentioned where Julia [Gillard] lived,' Mr Hem said.

Mr Hem said he realised at this point that the Abbotsford home where Mr Wilson dropped into to pay tradesmen 'was in fact Julia's'.

Mr Hem began working as a librarian and researcher at the AWU in 1994.

The inquiry is examining allegations figures in the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) West Australian branch set up a secret 'slush fund' in the early 1990s and used some of the cash to help officials win elections.
