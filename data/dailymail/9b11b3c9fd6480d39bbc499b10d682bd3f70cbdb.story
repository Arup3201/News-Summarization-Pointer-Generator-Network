Celebrating your golden wedding anniversary and 50 years of happy marriage is a joyful occasion for any couple.

More so if you're sharing that joy with four of your best friends who are raising a glass to exactly the same achievement... and even more so if you were coincidentally married on the same day and in the same church as the two other couples.

And a trio of septuagenarians have done just that. Norman and Mary Dickinson and Harry and 
Jean Winstanley, from Flookburgh, Cumbria, and Alan and Anne Akrigg, 
from Cark, Cumbria, were all married at St John's Church in Flookburgh on the same day 50 
years ago in 1963.

The couples (from left Mary and Norman Dickinson, Jean and Harry Winstanley and Alan and Anne Akrigg) return to St John's Church, Flookburgh, where they all married on the same day in 1963

The couples, standing outside St John's Church in Flookburgh (from left, Mary and Norman Dickinson, Jean and Harry Winstanley and Alan and Anne Akrigg) have all remained the best of friends since their big day in 1963

It was coincidence that all three couples ended up marrying on the same day, but since then they have all remained very close friends.

Mr Dickinson, now 77, was proud to marry Mary, now 76, when they said their vows at 11am. The couple had a four-year courtship beginning with a first date to the 'pictures', and now have two sons, Andrew and John.

Mr Dickinson said: 'When we had been out a few times, I knew it was love. She was definitely the girl for me.'

The couple, who were closely followed down the aisle by Mr and Mrs Akrigg, believe the key to a healthy marriage is a 'good argument now and again'.

Mr and Mrs Akrigg, who met at a young farmers' dance in Ulpha, were next to say 'I do' at 1pm. Mr Akrigg, now 77, said: 'It was only 18 months after that when we got married, but I just knew. She worked at a sweet confectionery shop making chocolates - I knew they were good.'

His wife Anne, 73, said: 'Alan was a very good dancer, that was the attraction. We have of course had our ups and downs but we love each other very much.

'I don't believe anyone who says they don't fall out, but you get over it. You have to give and take and you have to stand down even when you think you're right.'

The couple have two sons, Richard and Martin, and three grandchildren.

Richard was so close to the Dickinson's son John that they were each other's best man at their own weddings.

And on that day at 2pm, at the tender age of 21, Mr and Mrs Winstanley were married.

The couple, who now have children Julie, Paul and Katherine, and two grandchildren, got to know each other when their siblings married, but it wasn't love at first sight for both.

Mr Winstanley said: 'The first time we met I had the feeling I liked her but she didn't want to know me. If I walked in a room she walked out, but I managed to win her over in the end.'

Unlike the other 71-year-olds they said they didn't argue much at all.

Mrs Winstanley said: 'My sister married his brother when we were 15. We were the last couple to get married, but it was a surprise to hear about the other weddings as we all went to school together.

'It was a big surprise, we have been really close ever since, and friends for all these years. We both agree to have no secrets and not to fall out over money.'

The three couples marked their golden wedding anniversaries with family and friends.

Mrs Akrigg added: 'The only problem was we couldn't go to each other's parties because we were celebrating ourselves!'
