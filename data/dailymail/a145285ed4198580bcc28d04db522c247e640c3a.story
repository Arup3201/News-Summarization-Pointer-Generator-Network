Australia's urgent quest to appoint a new national coach ahead of their European tour took a major step forward today, as Michael Cheika confirmed that he has been offered the job.

The New South Wales Waratahs coach – who was previously in charge at Leinster and Stade Francais – guided his side to the Super 15 title this year and he was linked to the Wallabies role even before Ewen McKenzie’s abrupt resignation on Saturday. Now, rumours that Cheika had already been approached have been reinforced by the news that he is on the verge of being appointed.

On Sunday, Bill Pulver, the embattled chief executive of the Australian Rugby Union, claimed that he faced a race to find a coach to front the five-match tour which begins against the Barbarians at Twickenham on November 1. However, it appears that he had in fact made his move during the final stages of McKenzie’s turbulent regime.

Cheika suggested that he is keen to accept the job, but there are still issues to resolve if he is to be in position by the time the Wallabies fly north on Friday. 

‘It’s a pretty humbling experience to be asked to be involved in something like that, but we’ll see what happens,’ he told the Sydney Morning Herald. ‘There are a few things to be ironed out, obviously the logistics etc ... everything is so close. So we will see how it goes and work it out from there.’

Asked if he was excited about the opportunity, he added: ‘Who wouldn't be excited.’ And despite having a year left on his contract with the Waratahs, it seems that the Sydney-based franchise are ready to release him in the national interest.

McKenzie resigned shortly after Australia succumbed to an agonising 29-28 defeat against New Zealand in Brisbane – against a backdrop of controversy.

His position had appeared untenable as the ARU were thought to have begun discreetly sounding out potential replacements for the former Queensland Reds coach, who only took over last summer. He had been under siege after suspending maverick back Kurtley Beale for sending offensive text messages about a female member of the Wallabies’ staff, team business manager Di Patston – who promptly resigned. McKenzie was then forced to deny having a personal relationship with Patston.

Bill Pulver, chief executive of the Australian Rugby Union, hastily blamed McKenzie’s departure on a media campaign against him, leading to questions about his own position. ‘Ewen said he was going to struggle to retain the level of support he needs from the playing group, in my view, because of the character assassination he’s suffered in the last two weeks.’

The Wallabies are in turmoil, just weeks before matches against the Barbarians, Wales, France, Ireland and England – and 11 months before a World Cup where they find themselves in a pool of death alongside England and Wales.
