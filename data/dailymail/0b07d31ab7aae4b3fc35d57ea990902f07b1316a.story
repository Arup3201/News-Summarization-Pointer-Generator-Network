A cancer survivor who lost his eye and jaw to the disease has had his face rebuilt by surgeons - using parts of his thigh and shoulder.

Josh Stephenson, 48, was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer - malignant orbital melanoma - in October 2009.

The designer was treated with radiotherapy in early 2010, but the cancer spread to his face and doctors were forced to operate.

Surgeons operated on Mr Stephenson’s face during two full-day surgeries four months apart in 2010. In the first they removed his eye and replaced it with thigh tissue. During the second they removed his upper left jaw and 
part of the roof of his mouth and rebuilt it using part of his shoulder blade.

Mr Stephenson has undergone around 50 hours of surgery during seven operations and faces further procedures.

Despite his harrowing ordeal, the former luxury designer with Harrods is determinedly upbeat.

'You just have to get on with it,' he told Mail Online.

'It's been a journey and although my 
face looks a bit of a mess, it's a work in progress. Each procedure 
makes it look a little bit better.'

He added that support from his team of doctors, family and friends had been essential.

'Without them I don’t know what I would have done,' he said.

Mr Stephenson, from Cambridge, first noticed something was wrong when the skin around his eye became itchy.

He
thought it was just hayfever, but when his eyelid became swollen he was
referred to a specialist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.

Doctors
believe Mr Stephenson may have had his cancerous freckle at the back of his 
eyeball since birth and it had been growing slowly into a tumour ever 
since. Mr Stephenson believes stress could be an important factor in triggering his condition.

Mr Stephenson said: 'I was devastated when I was
first diagnosed with cancer. But thanks to the skills of wonderful 
surgeons I am still here.

'I am so grateful for the treatment that saved my life. Sadly, however, not everyone survives.'

Mr Stephenson, who is being monitored twice a year by the oncology department at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, said his doctors are happy with his progress.

'They say my skin has healed incredibly well,' he said.

'The sensations have been very odd though. Sometimes it feels like pins and needles, other times I get a "pressing-in" feeling or numbness.

'It can be tricky with one eye in crowded spaces as well.'

Mr Stephenson is currently in remission although he is aware the cancer could return.

'It can always come back if it has been in the lymph nodes,' he said.

Next month he will have another operation that will remove some of the skin from inside his mouth, which will make it easier for him to eat and speak. Surgeons will also fill in a bit more of his face using some fat taken from his stomach and replacing his temporary teeth with permanent implants.

He said: 'There will be different experts working on my mouth and eye at the same time.'

Mr Stephenson is keen to raise awareness for both Cancer Research UK and the charity Saving Faces, who have both provided him with support during his three-year ordeal.

He said: 'I
not only lost my jaw and eye, which was upsetting enough, but I also 
lost my income after the diagnosis. It left me out of work and I 
received no benefits.

'I fell in a bracket that didn't qualify because I had worked hard and had savings.

'We
need to fight back against this disease by raising money so that 
brilliant research can be translated into treatments for patients fast.'

He
is setting up an online accessories business called Josh Stephenson's 
Designs and plans to give a percentage of the business' income to charity.

'I've been holding charity coffee morning and lunches as well,' he said.

'One raised £2,000, which I was really pleased with. Last week my mother sold some old toys raising £70 - every little helps!'

Jane Redman, from Cancer Research, said: 'One in three people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer at some point of their lives. Thanks to the incredible progress that's been made in the last 40 years, more people are surviving than every before.

'But there's still so much more to do. Every pound we raise takes us a step closer to achieving our goal to beat this disease.'
