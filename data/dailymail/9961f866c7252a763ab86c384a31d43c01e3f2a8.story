Florida, the home of white beaches, oranges and Disneyland, is actually the most stressed-out state in the U.S., according to a new study.

Movoto.com compiled the rankings based on a number of lifestyle stressors, and rated Florida and its neighboring Georgia, which came in second, highest on the stress-out meter, both for having high unemployment rates and high numbers of people risking it without health insurance, among other factors.

New Jersey came in third and New York came in seventh, both for being particularly overcrowded, with inhabitants facing long commutes, and 'stupid-expensive property tax', while oil-rich North Dakota, and agricultural hubs Iowa and South Dakota, appear to have it easiest across the board, finds the study.

Six stress-inducing factors were compiled to into a final 'Big Deal Score' for each of the 48 states analyzed; unemployment rates, hours worked, population density, percentage of income spent on housing, percentage of population with long commutes the number of people without health insurance.

In at number four on the scale was California, another state where even its exceptionally good weather doesn't make up for its stress factors. Although Californians work some of the shortest hours nationwide, the unemployment rate is the fifth highest, housing costs swallow up a high percentage of people's budget, plenty don't have health insurance, and the commute time is up there as being the ninth worst in the U.S - Maryland taking the top spot on that factor.

Nevada was ranked the fifth most stressful state to live in, with the second highest unemployment rate in the country, beaten only by Michigan, and the second highest number of people without health insurance, narrowly beaten by Texas on that front. On the bright side, the population density is low, so at least Nevadans have space to stretch out as they contemplate their stressful existences.

Results: Florida (left) was ranked highest on the stress-o-meter for factors including its high unemployment rates and high numbers of people risking it without health insurance, while North Dakotans enjoy plenty of space, short commutes and cheap housing (right)

Illinois came in at number six on the scale, with more than 61per cent of its population faced with soul-destroyingly long commutes every day, as well as expensive housing.

North Carolina scored ninth, with a high number of people per square mile, but with housing costs below average. Similarly, working hours are long but commutes aren't too bad, followed by Arizona at number ten, with very similar attributes.

Bang in the middle of the road in terms of stress-out factors, are Louisiana, Delaware and Ohio, and hanging loose as some of the least stressed states after North Dakota, Iowa and South Dakota, are Minnesota, Nebraska, Vermont, Wyoming and Montana.

Nightmare: Maryland (pictured) scored highly on the stress scale for being overcrowded, with the longest commute times in the whole country

The three hardest working states in terms of long hours are Wyoming, Louisiana and North Dakota respectively; all notably low on their overall stress-out scores, however. States with the shortest working hours are Utah, Oregon and Rhode Island.

Unemployment is highest of all in Michigan, Nevada and the aforementioned Florida, and lowest in North Dakota, followed by South Dakota and Wyoming.

And more people have health insurance in Massachusetts, Vermont and Minnesota than in any other states, but Texans, Nevadans and Floridians have the lowest numbers respectively. 

All rankings were compiled using data from the most recent U.S. Census' American Community Survey, from 2008-2012.
