A Chinese traveller has been thrown in a police detention centre for 10 days after he opened an emergency exit moments before a plane was due to take off.

Dong She insists he opened the door by mistake, telling Chinese media he thought the handle was a handrail that he could grab onto for support.

The 42-year-old told Chinese news website iyaxin.com: ‘I thought it was like the handrail on a bus.’

The passenger said he had never been seated next to an emergency exit and opened the door by mistake

He told the website that he has flown on a plane before but he had never been seated next to an emergency exit until Saturday’s incident.

He said he felt nervous and as a result had stood up and moved to the door to grab hold of what he thought was a handrail.

The man, who was travelling with his wife on a domestic flight with Urumqi Airlines in north-east China, said he became scared when the door opened.

He told police that escorted him from the plane: 'I didn't see any difference between that and what you see on the underground trains, where you can stand up and hold onto the side if you don't want to be seated.

'I usually find when I'm feeling nervous that it's best to stand up and walk around, and I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong.' 

In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors on a China Eastern flight in Chengdu

The plane returned to its gate and flight attendants reported the incident to local police, who removed the man from the flight and took him to a police station.

He has been detained for 10 days for causing a 30-minute delay for other passengers, who were flying from Urumqi to Zhengzhou.

Officials told iyaxin.com that the inflatable slide did not deploy when the emergency door was opened on flight UQ2505.

An airline official pointed out that signs are posted on the door to warn passengers not to open it or tinker with its handle.

Saturday’s incident was at least the fifth time since December a passenger has opened an emergency exit on a plane in China.

Last month, an unidentified man was detained for 10 days after opening a plane emergency exit as passengers were boarding at Nanjing airport, the South China Morning Post reported.

He told airline staff ‘The door is not important’ when they asked him why he opened the door, the newspaper reported.

In December, a first-time passenger yanked open an emergency door, activating the emergency slide

In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors in protest of a weather-related delay as their China Eastern flight taxied to a runway in Chengdu. It led to a longer delay for everyone on board.

A month earlier, a man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit ‘to get off quicker’ after a China Eastern flight landed in Hainan. By unlocking an opening the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide.

Also in December, a rookie traveller yanked open a door on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu to ‘get some fresh air’ shortly before it was supposed to take-off.
