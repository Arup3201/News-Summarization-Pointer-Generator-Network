These newly-built redbrick homes have been dubbed the ugliest bungalows in Britain, and have even been compared to a prison, after they sprung up in a suburban borough.

The 12 terraced homes are made up of 20ft high solid brick slabs and come with just two tiny front windows – encouraging local residents to dub them the ‘The Crematorium’.

Neighbours of the new development in Dagenham, Essex claim the ‘awful’ buildings are a blot on the landscape and overshadow the picturesque neighbouring property – a Grade II-listed registry office where couples often tie the knot.

The redbrick one and two-bedroom 
bungalows are being built by Barking and Dagenham Council and are 
scheduled for completion later this summer. It is currently not known how much they will be marketed for.

Retired printer Terry Boughen, 74, who has lived in the area for 52 years, said: ‘This is the absolutely worst thing that’s ever been done in this area.

‘Those things are meant to be bungalows, but they’re as high as a two-storey house.

‘Everyone keeps asking what factory they are building.

‘If they’re not Britain’s ugliest homes, they’re definitely Britain’s ugliest bungalows.

‘There used to be an old people’s home there, but now it’s just a mess.

‘There’s nothing anyone could do to make them look better.’

However, due to their appearance, 
residents have already exclaimed how similar they look to a prison and 
now refer to the development as ‘Fort Dagenham’.

A spokesman for Barking and Dagenham Council said trees and climbing plants would be added to soften the buildings' appearance 'in the near future'

So far, more than 300 people have applied to live in the development - but several were said to be disappointed with the real view versus the artist's impression

Retired metal worker John Taylor, 84, who lives opposite, said: ‘It’s bloody awful - there used to be a really nice old persons home there which they’ve knocked down for this eyesore.

‘It’s not pleasant for people living here at all.

‘The council have said they’re going to put trees up to improve it but it would take a miracle to make that thing look half decent.

‘It’s ruined my view when I look out the window, I’m just faced with a brick wall.

‘It’s like having a prison built outside your home - imagine living there and having people round, you’d be embarrassed having them walk to the front door.

‘They haven’t planned it well at all.’

Former council leader Charles Fairbrass, 78, who lives opposite the bungalows, added: 'It looks like the prison they want to build down the road'

Stephen and Alaine Crowley said they had been shown the artist’s impression of the development - which could be seen hanging on fencing around the site - and told the street outside would be tree-lined.

Mrs Crowley, 52, said: ‘The picture we saw at the start was nice but it isn’t what we have ended up with. It’s terrible.’
