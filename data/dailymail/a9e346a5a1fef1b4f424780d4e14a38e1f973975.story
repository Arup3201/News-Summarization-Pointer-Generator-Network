President Barack Obama will host a concussion conference in the United States on Thursday as concerns about head injuries in sport reaches the world’s highest political office.

He is expected to unveil new commitments by the public and private sectors aimed at raising awareness of the dangers of concussion following a $765million agreement by the NFL to compensate players suffering from early-onset dementia linked to multiple head injuries.

‘This is something that I think a lot of families spend a lot of time worrying about and want to know as much as they can about, and want to be sure that they’re taking all the precautions they can on behalf of their children,’ a White House spokesman said.

Accepted there could be a link between multiple concussions and the early onset of dementia.

Agreed to fund a long-term research into the issue

Agreed to introduce widespread concussion education across the professional game

Agreed to look again at the controversial Pitch Side Concussion Assessment

Agreed to tighten up return to play protocols to ensure players receive adequate rest after suffering concussion

Accepted rugby has far more to do to ensure players across the game understand the risks of playing on with concussion

Athletes, coaches, parents, medical experts, administrators and campaigners will attend the White House Healthy Kids and Safe Sports Concussion Summit, aimed at helping to identify, treat and prevent concussions and promote research into injuries in order to better address the problems.

‘The conference is an important development in the debate about concussion in sport,’ said former NFL star and campaigner Chris Nowinski.

‘If the President of the United States is prepared to look at this issue then it suggests it is being taken pretty seriously. I believe the US is leading the way on this subject and other countries, including the UK, will inevitably follow.’

A cross-party paper into concussion in sport will be published in Parliament next month following months of campaigning by the Mail on Sunday.

The International Rugby Board and Rugby Football Union have introduced a raft of new measures to improve player welfare in recent months but the Football Association have yet to introduce any clear protocols despite a promise to do so in March.
