Stinging attack: Liberal Democrat diehard Susan Gaszczak wrote a furious open letter to Nick Clegg

A Liberal Democrat activist who accused Lord Rennard of molesting her quit the party in disgust last night after it decided not to censure him.

In a stinging open letter to Nick Clegg, Susan Gaszczak said she and four members of her family would be tearing up their membership cards.

The former county councillor revealed that a disciplinary review held by the party had ruled earlier this week that there was insufficient evidence the peer broke any rules.

This is despite an earlier report by Alistair Webster QC which found broadly credible evidence that he had ‘violated the personal space’ of a string of women.

Miss Gaszczak wrote: ‘I can no longer remain a member of a party that feels it is acceptable for the then chief executive to invite me to his hotel room to advance my political career.

‘Even though I have complained, and raised this for over seven years, the party still do not see the complaint as an issue.’

Miss Gaszczak is one of four female activists who spoke out to claim the party’s powerful chief executive had inappropriately touched and propositioned them.

In May, Lord Rennard, who had defied Mr Clegg’s advice to say sorry to the women for four months, finally issued a statement admitting he ‘may well have encroached upon personal space’. Although he made a grovelling apology for any harm or embarrassment caused to them, he claimed any such behaviour would have been ‘inadvertent’.

Miss Gaszczak’s resignation will pile more pressure on Mr Clegg to throw the peer out of the party – because Lord Rennard’s allies have suggested he is keen to make a comeback as their election strategist.

He is still suspended from his post pending an inquiry over the handling of the case brought by Miss Gaszczak, Alison Goldsworthy, Bridget Harris and Alison Smith.

Miss Gaszczak added in the letter, published on the Lib Dem Voice website: ‘This week the appeals panel met and threw out our appeal to an unfair process. I have been called credible more than once. Yet still no one feels it is appropriate to deal with the issue.’

She said other alleged victims had come forward since the media storm over the issue, and accused Mr Clegg of failing to take the claims seriously.

Comeback: Lord Rennard released a grovelling apology admitting he 'may well have 
encroached upon personal space' - but maintained any behaviour would have been 
'inadvertent'

‘Only four of us were brave enough to go public – how many more do you need on public record?’ she wrote.

‘You
 have a serious thorn in your side. He claims to have built the party, 
but actually I see him destroying it. I wish you the very best for the 
future but your personal apology is not enough to keep my membership 
current.’

A former 
parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats, Miss Gaszczak said 
she had put ‘love, effort, sweat and tears’ as well as much of her own 
money into helping the party over the years.

Both her mother and father – himself a councillor for 24 years – and her son and daughter have also resigned their Lib Dem membership in protest.

A party spokesman said: ‘We are saddened that Susan Gaszczak has made this decision which was clearly very difficult for her. She has been a devoted and passionate campaigner for the Liberal Democrat cause over many years and will be sorely missed by many in the party.

‘The Liberal Democrats recognise the seriousness of these complaints and that there was a failure in our processes which meant action was not taken sooner.’

Mr Clegg is also accused of being slow to respond to claims of serious sexual misconduct by Mike Hancock, the Portsmouth MP, who made unwanted advances toward a vulnerable female constituent.

The Webster report concluded it was ‘unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that Lord Rennard had intended to act in an indecent or sexually inappropriate way’.
