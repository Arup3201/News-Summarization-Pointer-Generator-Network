A businessman has clambered onto a ledge on the dome of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City to protest against Italian and European economic policies.

Video footage showed the man, identified as Marcello Di Finizio, jumping over railings near the top of the 450ft high dome before unveiling the giant banner.

Written in Italian the message translates as: 'Help! Enough Monti, Enough Europe! Enough Multinationals!'

Protest: Italian businessman Marcello Di Finizio stands on the dome of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City with his banner protesting against the government's economic policies

Danger: Mr Di Finizio risked his safety by clambering out on the roof of the iconic building (pictured left and right). The banner translates as: 'Help! Enough Monti, Enough Europe! Enough Multinationals!'

Mr Di Finizio is believed to own a beach bar that rents out parasols and lounge chairs to sunbathers.

He is reportedly angry about an EU directive and an Italian 
government plan that will see licences to operate patches of seafront 
auctioned off transparently from 2016.

Beach workers say the plan will favour multinational companies over smaller local businesses.

Mr Di Finizio unveiled the giant home-made banner on Tuesday afternoon after tying a cord to railings and abseiling to a ledge over a window in the cupola of St Peter's dome - to the shock of visitors taking a tour nearby.

He remained on the dome into Tuesday evening, flashing a strobe light as Vatican police and firefighters worked to find a way to bring him down to safety.

He is even reported to have been allowed to vent his complaints to Italian government ministers by phone - but still refused to come down.

Mr Di Finizio had already climbed out onto St 
Peter's dome during a shorter protest in July when he demanded a meeting
with Italian Tourism Minister Piero Gnudi, according to beach industry website 
Mondo Balneare.

In August beach operators protested against the measures by keeping parasols closed along large stretches on Italy's coastline, according to the BBC.

They claim the new rules threaten the jobs of some 600,000 resort workers.

Pope Benedict XVI held a service on Wednesday morning in the square below the Basilica.
