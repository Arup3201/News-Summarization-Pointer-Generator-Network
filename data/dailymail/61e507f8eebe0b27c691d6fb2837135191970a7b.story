If you were packing to go into space, you'd be forgiven for leaving your hairbrush behind.

But astronaut Sandy Magnus may now be regretting not paying more attention to her hair, as pictures of her wild barnet beam around the world.

The wacky 'do is the result of the zero-gravity conditions on board the International Space Station, where Dr Magnus and her fellow crew-members were snapped talking to President Obama.

Up, up and away: Sandy Magnus' hair has stolen the show on the International Space Station

Wave: The astronauts say goodbye to the President at the end of the call

The president was making the last 
ever call to space from the White House, but despite the historic 
circumstances he could not resist slipping in a joke or two.

When
the astronauts came on the line, the president said: 'Oh, I was just 
dialling out for pizza and I didn't expect to end up in space.'

Later in the call, he referred to the fact that 10 people - four members of the shuttle Atlantis and six residents of the space station - had to share the station's two toilets and Atlantis's sole toilet.

'My wife and daughters are always crowding me out — hopefully you all have a better arrangement up there,' he quipped.

The main themes of his conversation were praise and thanks for the shuttle program's service.

'I know that there have been thousands who have poured their hearts and souls into America's space shuttle program over the last three decades that are following this journey with special interest,' he said.

'To them and all the men and women of Nasa, I want to say thank you. You helped our country lead the space age, and you continue to inspire us.'

Atlantis is in the midst of a 13-day resupply mission to the space station. Its landing, currently set for next Thursday, will spell the end of the 30-year space shuttle program.

Atlantis and its two sister shuttles, Discovery and Endeavour, are to be retired to museums.

Obama said Nasa would continue to push the frontiers of space exploration and human space flight in the post-shuttle era. The White House has set a goal of sending astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025 and to Mars and its moons by the mid-2030s.

In the meantime, commercial space taxis will be developed to resupply the space station, and eventually take astronauts up as well.

Obama noted that Atlantis' crew is leaving behind a U.S. flag that was flown on the very first shuttle mission, to be turned over to the first crew to arrive on the station on a U.S. commercial spacecraft.

'I understand it's going to be sort of like a "capture the flag" moment here for commercial spaceflight,' Obama said. 

'So good luck to whoever grabs that flag.'

Atlantis' commander, Chris Ferguson, said: 'We sure hope to see some of our commercial partners climbing on board really soon.'

Earlier in the day, Atlantis' crew fixed another one of their main computers after it failed and set off an alarm that shattered their sleep. Nasa declared all five of Atlantis' primary computers to be working, pending evaluation of the latest shutdown.

As their time at the space station wound down, the shuttle crew got another celebrity call Friday, this time from Sir Paul McCartney.

'Good luck on this, your last mission. Well done,' McCartney said in a prerecorded message.

The wake-up music was Good Day Sunshine by the Beatles. The previous two days, Elton John and R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe sent greetings.
