It has been 40 years since they were on our television screens – but those decades have done nothing to diminish our love of Monty Python.

Last night thousands of fans – some dressed as their favourite Python characters – descended on London's O2 Arena for the comedy act's stage reunion.

John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones – delighted their fans when they announced the comeback concerts last year. But did it live up to the hype?

The show, which features an extended cast of dancers, an orchestra and special effects, includes numerous set changes and costs around £4.5million to stage.

Last night it opened with a trademark animation featuring the face of the late Python Graham Chapman and Doctor Who’s ship – dubbed the ‘retardis’ – flying through space before the Pythons came on stage.

One of the first classic sketches they performed was the four Yorkshiremen comparing their tough upbringing. The audience were also treated to clips from the old shows including the fish-slapping sketch.

Palin got a great ovation for his performance of The Lumberjack Song complete with an advert inviting tourists to visit Canada for its ‘elks and exciting mayors’, while John Cleese treated the audience to The Spanish Inquisition sketch.
