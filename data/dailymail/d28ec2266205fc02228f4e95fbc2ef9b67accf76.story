Two women who spiked their victims with a dangerous drug known as 'Devil's Breath' before robbing them have been arrested in Colombia.

Nini Johana Rey Sanchez, 33, and Jenny Fabiola Rodriguez Velasquez, 29, would prey on lonely men in the nightclubs and bars in Bogota, before slipping the potent drug scopolamine into their drink

Scopolamine, known on the streets of the South American country as 'The Devil's Breath', causes people to lose their free will and their memory.

Arrested: The women - who worked together under the nickname the Nanitas - have been arrested after stealing an estimated £27,000 in cash and goods

Devil's Breath: Scopolamine is made from the Borrachero tree, which blooms with deceptively beautiful white and yellow flowers. The odourless and tasteless drug can kill

Scopolamine - known as the most dangerous drug in the world - is odourless and tasteless, making it impossible for victims to detect when it is poured in their drink.

The drug can even be blown in the face of a passer-by on the street, and within minutes, the victim can be rendered 'zombie like' under the drug's effect.

It completely blocks the formation of memories, which means victims have absolutely no idea what has happened to them and stand no chance of identifying the people who have assaulted or robbed them. 

The CIA are believed to have used the drug as part of Cold War interrogations, with the hope of using it like a truth serum. 

However, because of the drug's powerful chemical makeup, it also induces strong hallucinations which can leave victims unable to speak.

Scopolamine is odourless and tasteless, making it impossible for victims to detect.

According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the drug - also known as hyoscine - causes the same level of memory loss as diazepam. 

Stories surrounding potent scopolamine remain the stuff of urban legend, with some telling horror stories of how people were raped, forced to empty their bank accounts, and even coerced into giving up an organ. 

In ancient times, the drug was given to the mistresses of dead Colombian leaders – they were told to enter their master's grave, where they were then buried alive. 

Joseph Mengele - the Nazi's Angel of Death - experimented on using scopolamine as an interrogation drug on prisoners.

The drug is derived from the borrachero tree, which is common in Colombia, and noted for its white and yellow flowers.

The women - who operated under the nickname the 'Nanitas' - would approach lonely men in the bars of the south of city, before chatting them up to gain their trust.

The pair would then spike their target's drinks, before marching them to a cash point and having them empty their accounts once they were under the effect of the drug. 

Police estimate they may have stolen as much as £27,000 in cash and goods from around 30 victims over the years. 

After drugging the men, the women - together with an accomplice taxi driver who was caught last October - would take the men to cashpoints and have them empty their accounts. 

They would also take men back to their homes and make off with their appliances and valuables. 

One man told police he was robbed and beaten after being drugged, and felt the after effects of scopolamine for two days. 

The two women are set to be charged with aggravated robbery and kidnapping. According to a police investigator, their last heist pocketed them approximately £600 in cash, along with their victim's watch, wallet and mobile phone.

General Humberto Guatibonza, commander of Bogota's metropolitan police, said: 'We officially received four complaints from victims and initiated an investigation. 

'Finally we located the women and established that they had participated in at least 30 more cases with victims in Bogota.' 

Video shows the two women after being arrested, both wearing blue jeans and dark jackets and covering their faces.

Police revealed that the women would also dye their hair every two weeks to avoid being detected by the authorities. 

It is believed they would alternate between blonde, red and purple hair dyes to continue to commit their crimes.

The Colombian daily newspaper El Tiempo has reported a 57% increase in scopolamine attacks in the city.

In 2014, Colombian police documented a total of 258 cases of male victims under similar conditions and so far this year police have already identified 25 cases.

Following the arrests, police have advised men in bars and clubs not to be tempted to 'continue the party' with women that approach them out of the blue.  

A drug-free version of this form of robbery is known as the 'paseo milionaro' - or 'walk of millionaires' - and is often carried out on tourists in the city.
