Royal girlfriend: Cressida Bonas walked and had a conversation on her mobile phone in west London

Just two days after her boyfriend's sister-in-law gave birth to Prince George, there was clearly plenty to discuss.

And Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas was pictured having a long conversation on her mobile phone in west London earlier this week.

The 24-year-old carried a John Lewis Oxford Street bag and wore a floral miniskirt with a cropped grey T-shirt, along with blue socks and black suede Dr. Martens boots.

Miss Bonas, who has earned the nickname 'Dress Down Cress' for her relaxed approach to fashion, was out shopping on Wednesday.

Her appearance came two days after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed their baby boy into the world on Monday evening. Kate had announced she was pregnant last year.

Sources say Harry seems 'incredibly keen' on dance student Miss Bonas.

She is the daughter of 1960s society beauty Lady Mary Gaye Curzon and her third husband, Old Harrovian businessman Jeffrey Bonas, who divorced in 1994.

A friend of Stowe-educated Miss Bonas said last month: 'She and Harry are very fond of each other and taking things one step at a time to see whether or not there might be something more permanent one day.'

Last month they were pictured arriving by train at London Kings Cross station after attending the society wedding of the year in Northumberland.

They had been at the wedding of royal confidante Thomas van Straubenzee and the Duke of Northumberland's daughter Lady Melissa Percy at Alnwick Castle.

At that event she wore a smart £430 Heidi Klein boho maxi dress and vintage blue sequin jacket.

Prince Harry, 28, and Miss Bonas also spent time together at the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset one week later, watching the Rolling Stones.
