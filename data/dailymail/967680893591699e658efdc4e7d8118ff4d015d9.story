The Veteran Affairs Inspector General is investigating a department hospital in Wisconsin amid allegations it has been over-prescribing powerful painkillers. 

Nicknamed 'Candy Land' because of its pill policy, the US Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Tomah has been linked to three deaths in the last three years. 

Marine Corps veteran Jason Simcakoski, 35, died of an overdose in the psychiatric ward of the hospital six months ago.

Simcakowski is the third hospital patient to die. Thomas Baer died last month and Jacob Ward died in 2013

Hospital patient Thomas Baer, 74, died last month and Jacob Ward, 27,  died in 2013.

Opiate prescriptions at the hospital almost quadrupled over an eight-year period, NBC News reported. 

The number of Oxycodone pills prescribed jumped from 50,000 in 2004 to 712,000 in 2012, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting. 

In addition to deaths of patients, the Inspector General reported veterans living in the area had been found dead by police surrounded by 'large quantities of prescribed controlled substances'.

An Air Force veteran who is a patient, Jason Bishop, said: 'They're breeding drug addicts.'

Hospital chief of staff Dr David Houlihan, who is known as the 'Candy Man', has been removed from his post.

Houlihan said in January: 'The problem is there is a lot of chronic pain.

'You don't hear a lot of veterans complaining about me.'

Simcakoski's family is complaining about the doctor after an autopsy revealed their son, a married father with an 11-year-old daughter, died from 'mixed drug toxicity'.

His mother, Linda Simcakoski, said: 'I just feel that he didn't have a chance.

'We trusted them and we expected them to know what to do and it just seems like they just kept giving him more and more.'

After a previous investigation, the VA Inspector General said there was a 'considerable variance' in the number of pain pills prescribed by Houlihan, but stopped short of saying he did anything criminal.

The VA said: 'Although the allegations dealing with general overuse of narcotics at the facility may have had some merit they do not constitute proof of wrongdoing.

'We did not find any conclusive evidence affirming criminal activity, gross clinical incompetence or negligence, or administrative practices that were illegal or violated personnel policies.'

Despite the allegations and investigation, hospital director Mario DeSanctis received a $8,025 bonus.

Marvin Simcakoski, the dead Marine's father, said of DeSanctis:

'I can't believe he would think it was OK to have his own son on that many medications.

'If he's the boss then he should be held responsible.'

Dr. Mary Eleanor Beal, who recently retired from an affiliated VA clinic, called DeSanctis 'completely out of touch with reality'.

She said:' He would go around enumerating the wonderful things that were going on in Tomah. 

'He should have had pompoms.'
