An extensive study of the brains of dead NFL and CFL players showed that the majority of them had signs of brain damage after suffering repeated head injuries.

The study, carried out by the Boston University School of Medicine, posthumously tested the brains of 50 footballers, 33 of whom played in the NFL.

It found a link between head injuries suffered in the heavy-impact sport and degenerative brain disease.

The study, which included stars such as Dave Duerson, Cookie Gilchrist and John Mackey, found widespread evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

The disease can lead to sufferers experiencing memory loss, dementia and depression.

Only one of the 35 football players showed no signs of brain disease, while 31 of the 34 NFL players (only one CFL player was included in the study) had stage three to four CTE.

In total, the study analysed 85 brain donors, including 21 army veterans. Most of those taking part in the study played sports.

The autopsies revealed extensive evidence of protein tangles clogging brain tissue and causing the destruction of brain cells in football players, wrestlers, hockey players, boxers, and the military combat veterans.

The New York Times reported that out of the 85 subjects, 68 men had a background in sports, and 50 people showed evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

The paper added that there were 34 brain samples that came from NFL players - and among them, only one was found not to show signs of CTE.

The researchers reported in the journal Brain that 68 of the 85 individuals they examined, all of whom had experienced repeated head trauma, had evidence of CTE.

There is a renewed concern of the 
lasting effects of football injuries following the death of Javon 
Belcher at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium.

Belcher killed himself in front of 
his coaches - moments after shooting his girlfriend, who had given birth
to the couple's first child three months prior.

Brain tissue from Dave Duerson, one of 
the most recent NFL figures to fatally shoot himself, was among the 
brain samples tested in the Boston University study.

Other former NFL players involved in the study were Ollie Matson, John Grimsley and Cookie Gilchrist.

Gone too soon: New York Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard killed himself last year. He was just 28 years old

The study is not just about 
football, as one sample came from hockey player Derek Boogaard, a New 
York Rangers enforcer who killed himself in May 2011.

Co-author Dr. Robert Cantu told The Boston Globe the study should convince doubters that CTE is a real condition caused by repeat head injuries.

Symptoms of CTE were first described in retired boxers in the 1920s and have been documented in football players, hockey players, boxers, military veterans, and those with a predilection for head banging.

While the condition has not been found in the brains of those without head trauma, Warinner said that could simply be due to the fact that it’s rare and that more brains in the general population need to be autopsied.

The new study described four stages of the disease, noting that symptoms can progress for years after head trauma.

It starts with headaches and problems with concentration in the early stages, followed by depression, aggression, explosive anger and short-term memory loss.

Then comes more serious cognitive impairment, and eventually full-blown dementia where a person doesn’t recognize loved ones.

Athletes and military veterans who experienced such symptoms before they died donated their brains for further research.
