Iowa mom Melody Lauer has a personal motto she is trying to pass on to others: 'If you have baby on one side, it’s best to have gun on the other.'

The 30-year-old  mother-of-three from Des Moines and former gun shop worker has started a new safety class that claims to teach women how to carry a firearm and their child at the same time.

Despite being a gun enthusiast, Lauer maintains her controversial class does not encourage women to conceal a weapon, but shows them how to do so properly.

'I have seen a huge insurgence in young mothers, mothers of young children, wanting to get into firearms,' Lauer told ABC 6.

Mom-and-gun enthusiast: Des Moines mother-of-three Melody Lauer has started a new gun safety class to show women how to 'responsibly' carry a firearm and their child at the same time 

Armed: The 30-year-old mom first got her gun permit at 21 and quickly became obsessed with weapon safety

Family first: Melody - who has children aged nine months, three and six - feels safer carrying a gun so that she can protect her kids

Support: Lauer was encouraged was encouraged to get her first gun (right) by her husband (together-left)

Popular: Lauer launched her 'Babywearing and Carrying' in February

Lauer continued: 'And what's happening is we don't have instructors that are addressing their needs. 

'So they just do it. They don't do it right and then they end up having an accident.'

The class is called 'Babywearing and Carrying' and the first seminar was in February.

Lauer says it has quickly become quite popular and is being hailed the first of its kind.

'To our knowledge, nobody is doing this yet,' Barry Snesll, who runs Crossroads Shooting Sports shooting range in Des Moines, said.

'The interest was so great that she actually had to turn off or shut off the registration. 

'Otherwise, we would have had two-three times as many people here.' 

Safety: Lauer's motto is iIf you have baby on one side, it’s best to have gun on the other'

Pro-gun: Mother-of-three Lauer said parents should be responsible enough to learn to carry a weapon safely

Safety: Lauer became dedicated to learning the correct safety measures associated with firearms 

Lauer got her gun permit at 21 to appease her husband, who said he would be more comfortable with her increasing travel commitments for work if his wife were armed.

She became dedicated to gun safety and learning how to use the weapon properly.

The idea for a class was then recently borne out of tragedy, she said.

'The idea for the class came out of hearing about the kid in Idaho who shot his mom recently,' Lauer told Yahoo! Parenting.

'That touched me in a very deep way because my daughter was 2 at the time.

'I thought, there’s no reason this should happen. We are adults and can be responsible.'

Because of the popularity in Des Moines, Lauer is now looking at ways to expand, and perhaps plan a weekend event.
