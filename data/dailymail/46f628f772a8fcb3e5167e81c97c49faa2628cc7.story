Real Madrid and Barcelona are the world’s most popular sports teams measured by social media followers, with each of the Spanish giants approaching 100million Facebook and Twitter fans combined.

Madrid’s galaxy of stars including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez have helped them to attract almost 82m ‘fans’ on the world’s most popular social network, Facebook, plus almost 15m Twitter followers for a combined following of 96.75m across the two dominant social platforms.

Barcelona’s array of talent including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez have helped to garner them slightly more Facebook fans than Real but a few fewer Twitter followers, hence second place overall.

Although those two big clubs are way ahead of any rivals, England’s Premier League is collectively the best represented in the world’s top 10 most popular clubs.

As our exclusive chart of the top 30 most popular teams shows - and Sportsmail looked at all sports sports teams across every nation, at club and international level - Premier League clubs fill five of the top 10 places.

Manchester United are at No 3 in the world, followed by Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool at No 4, No 5 and No 6, and Manchester City are at No 10.

United are approaching 70m Facebook likes and Twitter followers combined, well clear of Chelsea (46m) in the slot behind them.

Football teams dominate the top 10 and indeed the top 30. The only non football team in the top 10 are the LA Lakers of NBA basketball at No 9.

Football teams fill 17 of the 30 slots, with four of those being the national teams of Mexico (in 15th place), Brazil (16th), Germany (28th) and England (30th).

There are seven NBA teams in the top 30, three teams from the NFL in America, two from Major League Baseball and one Formula One team, Mercedes.

The Premier League cemented its reputation as being by far and away the most valuable league in Britain earlier this week when announcing new TV domestic deals for the 2016-19 seasons worth £5.136 billion.

Lewis Hamilton's Formula One success has helped his Mercedes team to accrue more fans   

But the league is also hugely popular overseas, and the global followings of the biggest teams are indicated in this survey of social media followings.

This list also effectively confirms basketball - or specifically the NBA - as the second most popular global game, after football.

Two Turkish clubs make the top 20 in our chart, with Galatasaray at No 13 with a combined 18.4m followers on the two platforms, and Fenerbahce in 14th place with 14.45m.

Galatasaray's passionate online support mean the Turkish side are currently 13th in the top 30 list

England are one of four national teams to feature in the the top 30 most popular sports teams in the world 

This shows two things; that the Turkish giants are fanatically followed at home, but also that they have worked hard for a number of years to be ‘early adopters’ of social media. 

Both have been at the forefront of using social media to promote themselves and expand their fanbases for several years.

The country breakdown for teams in the top 30 comprises 12 teams from the USA, six from England, two each from Spain, Germany (Bayern Munich and the national football team), Turkey and Mexico (Chivas plus the national football team), and one each from Italy (Milan), Brazil (the national football team), Britain (Mercedes) and Argentina (Boca Juniors).
