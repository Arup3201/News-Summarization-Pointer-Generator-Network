A Chinese veteran acrobat  has proved he still has what it takes, after a daredevil stunt which included walking over another tightrope artist coming the other way.

Adili Wuxor, 43, known as The Prince of the Tightrope, and his colleague, walked a 330ft long rope, stretched between two buildings, some 260ft in the air. 

Mr Wuxor and the fellow tightrope walker embarked on the dangerous stunt in the city of Jiaxing, in northern China's Zhejiang province.

A video from the stunt shows Mr Wuxor, dressed in red, as he steps outonto the rope high above the streets of Jiaxing.  

Without a safety line, he successfully walks more than halfway, while the audence several hundred feet below hold their breath.

Suddenly, to the crowd's surprise and joy, a  second tightrope artist, dressed in blue, starts walking towards Mr Wuxor.

As they approach, the man in blue, sits down, and then lies down on his back, allowing Mr Wuxor to walk over him, and continue to the other side.

 'It was pretty amazing,' said Mingmei Tang, 29, who watched the stunt from the street below.

'He's been around since base jumpers were in their nappies, its great he still has what it takes.'

In 2010 Mr Wuxor, an ethnic Uighur from China's Xinjiang Province, spent 60 days walking on a tightrope in the Bird's Nest Stadium.

Three years later, he completed a walk over the Pearl River in Guangdong province, walking a total of 1,640ft between Guangzhou's Canton Tower and a sculpture in front of the city's Haixinsha Stadium, while 330ft above the river.
