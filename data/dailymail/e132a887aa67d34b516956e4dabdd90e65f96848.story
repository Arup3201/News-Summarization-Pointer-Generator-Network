Mexican border crossings are being overwhelmed by a surge in immigrants who are claiming asylum  from drug violence in Latin America.

The thousands of asylum-seekers - reportedly 200 in a single day at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in California - are forcing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to pay for hotels rooms for hundreds of  immigrants while they wait for an immigration judge to decide whether they can stay in the country.

Thousands more are reportedly released into the country with promises that they will appear at asylum hearings. Federal authorities say those promises are almost never kept and the immigrants remain in the country illegally.

Standing in line: Hundreds of immigrants are awaiting asylum hearings at the Otay Mesa Border Crossing in Southern California

Fox News reports that 200 immigrants claimed asylum at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry near San Diego, California, in just one day last week.

Of those, 30 where taken to a hotel, where they were put up in rooms that cost $99 a night, according to Fox.

Seventy were released into the United States and ordered to appear for asylum hearings at a later date.

The rest were held at the overflowing Otay Mesa processing center and one at nearby San Ysidro.

Nearly all of the asylum-seekers used special 'code words' that force federal immigration officials to allow them to stay in the country long enough to have an asylum hearing.

The top phrase is 'credible fear' - the immigrants say they have a 'credible fear' of the drug cartels in Mexico.

Hundreds of immigrants are being housed in a $99-a-night hotel while they wait for a judge to rule on whether they can be granted asylum

'This clearly has to have been orchestrated by somebody,' former U.S. Attorney for Southern California Peter Nunez told Fox News.

'It's beyond belief that dozens or hundreds or thousands of people would simultaneously decide that they should go to the U.S. and make this claim.'

The attempts are nearly always futile. About 91percent of asylum claims from Mexico are denied. 

The immigrants are kept at a hotel until their asylum pleas can be heard by a judge.

Fox News documented one hotel, whose name the news outlet did not report for security reasons, where Customs vans arrived several times a week carrying immigrant families seeking asylum.

Armed Customs agents guard guard the door and other escort the new families inside.
