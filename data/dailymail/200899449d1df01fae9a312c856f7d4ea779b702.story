This is the shocking moment a mother left her baby in its pram and made a vicious racist attack on a total stranger.

Serial thug Amanda Lowe, 26, was only yards away from her daughters, aged four months and eight years, when she shouted abuse at a passer-by.

As her boyfriend joined in and punched the victim to the ground, Lowe repeatedly stamped on the man’s head before returning to her children, miming a punch and a kick to show what she had done.

Thug: Amanda Lowe is seen launching an unprovoked attack on Khuram Nisar in this shocking CCTV footage

A judge called Lowe a ‘disgrace’ 
after watching horrifying CCTV footage of the attack and warned of the 
effects it would have on her children.

Judge Lindsey Kushner, QC, told her: 
‘Kids who have mothers who behave like you end up behaving like you. 
That damage starts from when they are tiny.’

But despite the fact it was a fourth 
conviction for assault in six years for Lowe – who is now pregnant again
 – the judge spared her a prison sentence for the sake of those 
children.

That meant that despite a string of 
convictions between them, Lowe’s boyfriend and cousin, who also 
intervened, had to be freed as well because they had admitted less 
serious offences.

Lowe had been drinking with Wesley 
Earls, father of her unborn child, and Daniel Wray in Piccadilly Gardens
 in the centre of Manchester this May when the attack took place, the 
city’s Crown Court heard.

The area was crowded with families enjoying the evening sunshine as Khuram Nisar walked through on his way home from work.

Without provocation, Lowe shouted 
racist abuse at him and added: ‘You’re a terrorist, don’t come near me, 
I’m worried you’ll blow me up’ and ‘Go back to Pakistan’.

He responded by telling 26-year-old 
Earls to ‘control his woman’, but Earls reacted by punching Mr Nisar to 
the ground, joined by Wray, 21.

CCTV footage shows Lowe leaving her 
eight-year-old daughter, along with the pram with her baby in, and 
enthusiastically joining in the assault.

She is seen repeatedly kicking Mr Nisar’s head and stamping on it in front of witnesses. He suffered cuts and bruises.

After the fight was broken up Lowe appeared ‘thrilled’ by what she had done and threw a pretend punch, the court heard.

As they left the square Lowe was seen miming a kick. Seconds later the three were arrested.

Between them they had 21 previous convictions, the court heard, many for violence.

Lowe, who has a criminal record 
dating from when she was 17 including assaults and disorderly behaviour,
 admitted racially aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm.

Earls, who was last year given a 
restraining order over a domestic violence offence, and Wray, who in 
2009 was convicted of assaulting a police officer, both admitted a 
single charge of actual bodily harm.

Judge Kushner told Lowe: ‘The damage 
you are doing to your children – there at the time and seeing you drunk,
 the risk you put them at – is disgraceful. She was in that state in 
charge of two children.

'That in itself is a criminal 
offence, drunk in charge of a child. How irresponsible can you get? You 
could easily have been dealing with a care case here.’

But she said the ‘enormous impact’ that jailing Lowe would have on her children meant it was unfair to lock her up.

Lowe and Earls, both of Blackley, 
Manchester, were given 12-month jail sentences, suspended for two years,
 and two-year supervision orders.

Lowe was ordered to attend a ‘women’s programme’ while Earls was sent on a course for ‘violent, angry, impulsive drinkers’.

Wray, of Salford, said to have been ‘fleetingly’ involved by punching Mr Nisar before retreating, was given the same sentence.

Judge Kushner told all three that if they offended again they would go to jail.
