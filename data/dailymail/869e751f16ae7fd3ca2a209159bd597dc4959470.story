A mother has been charged with child cruelty in connection with the death of her five-year-old daughter.

Heaven Woods, five, was found unresponsive in the home of her mother’s boyfriend in Forsyth, Georgia, on Tuesday and later died in hospital as a result of blunt force trauma to her abdomen.

The family of Amanda Hendrickson, 33, a mother of several children and pregnant with another, are now calling for the death penalty if she is involved in her daughter’s death.

Charged: Amanda Hendrickson, 33, and her boyfriend Roderick Buckner, 34, faces felony first-degree child cruelty charges over the homicide of Hendrickson's daughter Heaven Woods, five

Heaven was found unresponsive in a home in Forsyth, belonging to Hendrickson’s boyfriend where the five-year-old and her mother had been living for the past month, and later died in hospital.

An autopsy revealed she was killed by blunt force trauma to her abdomen and that she was suffering from both new and old injuries.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is now investigating the death as a homicide, and have also arrested Hendrickson’s boyfriend.

The GBI said Hendrickson has a ‘history’ with the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services in their previous home town of Rome, and family members told a local news channel that she has several children and is pregnant with another child.

Hendrickson’s Facebook page backs this statement, showing pictures of a recent ultrasound as well as images of Heaven as a baby.

Devastated: Hendrickson¿s mother Lisa Coursey says her daughter, who is pregnant and has a history with local child services, should 'rot in hell' if she is involved in the death of five-year-old Heaven

According to family members, Heaven had previously been seen with visible evidence of physical abuse, but Ms Hendrickson had found explanations for them, such as falling over due to clumsiness.

When Heaven's grandmother noticed a bruise in the shape of a hand on the girls' throat, Ms Hendrickson said the girl had tried to choke herself.

Yesterday Hendrickson’s mother Lisa Coursey, and her half-sister Ashley Coursey, 21, called for the death penalty.

“I want justice for my granddaughter,’ Ms Coursey told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‘If she [her daughter] did this, she should rot in H-E-L-L.’

Hendrickson has been arrested on charges of felony child cruelty in the first degree and giving false statements.

Her boyfriend Roderick Buckner, 34, also faces felony first-degree child cruelty charges.

Authorities say additional charges are expected to be filed against both Hendrickson and Buckner, and the couple is being held without bond in the Monroe County Justice Center.
