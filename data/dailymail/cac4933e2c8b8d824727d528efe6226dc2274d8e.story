Students clashed with police in Spain today during a day of protests against cuts in education funding and rising tuition fees.

Protesters burned bins at a top Spanish university campus while thousands marched through the streets in a national strike against education cuts that has seen scores of arrests.

Students and schoolchildren joined rallies in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao and elsewhere to condemn reforms they say will block working class youngsters from a university education.

'Tuition, books and free transport for children of workers' and 'We want our scholarships' chanted crowds, as they called for the resignation of Education Minister Ignacio Wert.

Tensions were running high on this second day of a 48-hour strike called by Spain's Union of Students, after riot police last night arrested more than 50 students who had occupied a campus building in Madrid, the Spanish capital.

In Madrid, the Spanish capital, and the Basque cities of Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz students burned barricades and hurled stones at heavily armed riot police. 

In Pamplona eight youths taking part 
in a student march were arrested on charges of public disorder, while 
four others were held in Bilbao.

A
 Madrid police spokeswoman told AFP that officers arrested one person on
 Thursday morning 'for possession of flammable material' after bins were
 burned at Madrid's Complutense university.

Police
 also released on bail the 54 people arrested last night for burning 
bins and occupying offices at the Complutense campus in the west of 
Madrid, the spokeswoman said.

Students accuse the government of attempting to snatch educational opportunities away from the children of the working classes.

'No to education cuts,' they yelled, calling a halt to reforms that have seen cuts in spending on schools and universities while higher education fees have been increased.

'It makes me sad because they are not giving everyone the opportunity to study,' said one demonstrator, 18-year-old high school pupil Karim Martinez.

'They are raising fees and cutting scholarships. A lot of parents do not have the money to pay for university.'

Ignacio Frutos, 18, a student at 
Madrid Complutense University, told El Pais: 'In my first class of my 
Audiovisual Communication course 35 started, and now there are 20. I 
know that at least five have left for economic reasons.

'The
 People's Party government is trying to get the children of the workers 
not to go to university. Tuition of 1,600 euros a year is not acceptable
 to anyone.'

Spain's conservative government launched spending cuts in 2012 that aimed to save 150 billion euros (£124billion; $206 billion) to stabilise the public finances of the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy.

The student protests came after an estimated 1million took to the streets of Madrid last Saturday. Protesters came from across Spain, where the official unemployment rate is 26 per cent and nearly half of young workers have no jobs.

Six riot police and countless demonstrators were hurt when the 'March for Dignity' descended into violence.
