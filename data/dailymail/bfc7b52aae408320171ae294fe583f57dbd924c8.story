Court appearance: Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, of the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, made an initial appearance in federal court on Tuesday to face three counts of making interstate threats, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington.

The FBI has arrested a Washington man for making repeated threats against the life of Officer Darren Wilson, writing Facebook posts demanding, 'We need to kill this white motha f***a and anything that has a badge on'.

Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, started writing the messages immediately after Wilson shot Brown dead in August and according to the criminal complaint read in court on Tuesday in Seattle,'knowingly and willfully transmitted in interstate and foreign commerce' threats against Wilson's life.'

In addition to the specific social media threats, the Nintendo employee, who boasts an ISIS flag on his Facebook page, is also accused of trying to acquire a firearm to act out his desire as spokesman of 'the oppressed' who 'need to kill this white cop.'

If convicted, Abdul-Jabbaar faces a maximum of five years in prison and has been detained in custody ahead of a December 5 detention hearing in US District Court in Seattle.

It is unclear how he will plead or if he will be represented by an attorney, but the father of three has already deleted some of the more incriminating posts from his open Facebook profile.

However, in court on Tuesday, his threats against Wilson and Ferguson officers were read out, including those he has since removed.

In one that dates from November 24, the day the grand jury declined to charge officer Wilson, Abdul-Jabbaar uploaded a photograph of a Wilson to his Facebook page with the message, 'Ready to go and kill some cops.'

He followed that up later in the day with, 'We need to kill this white motha F***a and anything that has a badge on.'

Murderous support: Abdul-Jabbaar displays the flag of ISIS on his Facebook page - onto which he posted chilling threats towards Officer Darren Wilson 

Threats: Abdul-Jabbaar is accused of posting a string of threats to his personal Facebook page targeting police officers, specifically Wilson. The criminal complaint quoted one of the postings as saying: 'We the oppressed people need to kill this white cop.'

The next day there was a cartoon depicting a black man killing a white officer, with the message: 'We black folks should've been doing this to the police last night.'

Previously, on November 11, a Facebook message seen and recorded by FBI Agent Brett Grover, Abdul-Jabbaar wrote, 'Are there any REAL BLACK MEN that would love to go down to Ferguson Missouri to give back those bullets that [Wilson] fired into the body of Mike Brown.'

The message ends, 'If we're unable to locate [Wilson] then We'll return them to his wife and if not her then his children.'

In other, shocking posts to his Facebook page, Abdul-Jabbaar says that he 'would love to smoke a white motha f***'n cop.'

Born William Cox, Abdul-Jabbaar changed his name in 1990 after converting to Islam and according to the Smoking Gun has been divorced several times.

Revenge: Federal officials said Abdul-Jabbaar began making threats shortly after the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, an incident that touched off weeks of angry protests in the St. Louis suburb and calls for Wilson's arrest

Discoverd: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar's online postings went beyond free and protected speech

Action: Defendant Jaleel Tarik Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, of Kirkland began posting threats on Facebook soon after the shooting of Michael Brown, according to the criminal complaint.

Shocking: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar posted inflammatory messages for months that called on others to join him on a trip to Ferguson to "give back the bullets" that were fired at Brown.

His Facebook page has the image of the ISIS flag as the cover photograph and Acting United States Attorney Annette L. Hayes said in a statement, 'Although we each have the right to express our views about the decision reached by the state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, we cannot tolerate violence or threats of violence that are intended to intimidate, and ultimately silence debate. Such threats are crimes, and the individuals who make them must be held to account'

Officer Darren Wilson resigned from th Ferguson police force on Sunday after receiving death threats aimed at him and other colleagues.

His decision to leave the force came after his fatal shooting of Michael Brown on August 9 and the grand jury's failure to indict him.

The announcement that Wilson will face no charges led to huge rioting in Ferguson, followed by looting and the burning of a number of businesses.

No charges: A grand jury last week declined to indict Wilson on criminal charges, sparking demonstrations across the country over allegations of racial bias and police mistreatment of minorities

Fire: Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department last week, saying part of his decision stemmed from possible backlash against fellow officers

Abdul-Jabbaar has several prior convictions, including selling crack cocaine, domestic violence, weapons possession and assault.

He was also once found guilty of drugging and having 'indecent contact' with an underage girl who was suffering mental illness.

His last appearance in a court came in 2008 when he was sentenced to a year in prison following a gunfight with another man.

A sealed court document contends that Abdul-Jabbaar's sentenced may have been lessened by his cooperation with federal authorities in giving evidence against two al-Qaeda operatives who opened a training camp in Oregon in 1997.

While Abdul-Jabbaar had no involvement with the camp, his attorney at the time said that his client wanted to help authorities in their case against the two men who are now in custody.
