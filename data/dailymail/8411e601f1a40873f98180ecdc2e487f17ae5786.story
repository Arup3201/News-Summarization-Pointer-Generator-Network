A Russian entrepreneur who heads a hi-tech research project called 'Avatar' has contacted billionaires to offer them immortality.

Itskov claims he will personally oversee their immortality process, in exchange for an undisclosed fee.

Itskov,
 a media entrepreneur, claims to have hired 30 scientists to reach this 
goal - and aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years.

'You have the ability to finance 
the extension of your own life up to immortality. Our civilization has 
come very close to the creation of such technologies: it's not a science
 fiction fantasy. It is in your power to make sure that this goal will 
be achieved in your lifetime,' says Itskov in a letter delivered to billionaires listed in Forbes magazine.

He has contacted a list of billionaires 
with a proposal for funding his quest for immortality - which Itskov 
refers to as 'cybernetic immortality' and the 'artificial body'.

The initiative is opening its San Francisco office this summer, and will be launching a social media project connecting scientists around the world.

'The 2045 team is working towards creating an international research center where leading scientists will be engaged in research and development in the fields of anthropomorphic robotics, living systems modeling and brain and consciousness modeling with the goal of transferring one’s individual consciousness to an artificial carrier and achieving cybernetic immortality,' says Itskov's official site.

'Such research has the potential to free you, as well as the majority of all people on our planet, from disease, old age and even death.'

'For anyone interested, but skeptical, I am ready to prove the viability of the concept of cybernetic immortality by arranging an expert discussion with a team of the world's leading scientist working in this field.'I will also be willing to coordinate your personal immortality project entirely free of charge for the sake of speeding up the development of these technologies,'

Itskov, a 31-year-old media entrepreneur, says that he aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years. He says his technology will be of interest at first to the 'disabled and close to dying'

'This
 project is leading down the road to immortality,' says Itskov. 'A 
person with a perfect Avatar will be able to remain part of society. 
People don’t want to die.'

‘I understand these are some very big
 challenges for scientists,’ Itskov says. ‘But I believe in 
something you call ‘The American Dream.’ If you put all your energy and 
time into something, you can make it a reality.

Itskov envisages surgically 'transplanting' a human consciousness into a robot body within 10 years.

He hopes to then 'upload' minds without surgery, leaving human bodies as empty husks as their owners 'live on' inside robots.

The project is called Avatar after the James Cameron movie, set far in 
the future, where human soldiers use mind control to inhabit the bodies of 
human alien hybrids as they carry out a war against the inhabitants of a
 distant world.

'The
 next effort of science will be to create a new body for the human 
being,' says Itskov, speaking at the Global Future 2045 conference. 'It 
will have a perfect brain-machine interface to allow control and a human
 brain life support system so the brain can survive outside the body.'

Itskov says that the system will at first be of interest to, 'Disabled people and people at the edge of dying.'

'The
 third phase will be to create an artificial human brain,' he says - a 
computer environment into which human minds can be uploaded.

Measuring brain waves with EEG machine: Recent breakthroughs have allowed scientists to 'see' what is inside people's heads for the first time - but could the technology really be used to create robot Avatars?

His final goal, he says, is to upload human minds into holographic bodies.

Holograms
 give plenty of advantages. You can walk through walls, move at the 
speed of light, he says. ‘Remember in Star Wars, Obi-Wan’s hologram? 
That was pretty amazing.’

Itskov says he wants to work with DARPA - the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency in the U.S military.

DARPA is already  researching ways 
for its troops to use their minds to remotely control androids who will
 take human soldiers' place on the battlefield.

The Pentagon's 
hi-tech research arm, has earmarked $7million for research into the 
project, also nicknamed Avatar.

According to the Darpa's 2013 budget: 'The Avatar program will develop 
interfaces and algorithms to enable a soldier to effectively partner 
with a semi-autonomous bi-pedal machine and allow it to act as the 
soldier’s surrogate.'
