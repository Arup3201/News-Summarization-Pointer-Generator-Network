A drug addict was caught red-handed trying to burgle a house when a quick thinking homeowner filmed him on camera as he tried to break in.

Bernie Sawford, 58, was working on his computer at his home in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in March when he saw Stephen Neal, 26, in his garden.

The grandfather confronted Neal, who was armed with a metal bar, and the would-be thief claimed that he was hiding in the garden because he was being chased.

Mr Sawford used a video camera he was using for work to film Neal and called police who arrived minutes later.

After Mr Sawford showed officers the film, Neal was arrested nearby just ten minutes later.

Neal, from Ely, was jailed for 12 months at Cambridge Crown Court after admitting attempted burglary and possession of an offensive weapon.

Mr Sawford said after the sentencing: 'He tried to tell me he was hiding from some people who were after him but I told him he wouldn't be hiding in my garden.

'I got my video camera and told him that I was going to video him and he didn't seem to mind.

He added: 'I called the police and they arrived at the door within minutes.Â

'Apparently they were holding a training exercise in Ely that day for just such an incident so it was quite unlucky for him.'

The short clip shows Neal with his back to camera, apparently weighing up his options after he has been confronted by Mr Sawford.

Mr Sawford is seen exiting the house and can be heard saying to Neal: 'I'm just going to take a photo of you as I'm not very pleased.'

Neal turns to the camera and replies: 'Yes, that's fine.'

During Neal's trial, Cambridge Crown Court heard that he had 29 previous convictions for 65 different offences.

They included having sex with a woman in front of shocked worshippers in the grounds of Ely Cathedral in July 2010.

This is not the first time Neal has been caught red-handed by a homeowner.

He was jailed for 29 months in November 2011 after he was chased and caught by a resident in Ely whose house he had just burgled.
