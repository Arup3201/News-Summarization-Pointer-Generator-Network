A British engineering firm based on a remote Somerset farm are to help Facebook launch a network of solar-powered drones that will bring the internet to the remotest places on the planet.

The US web giant has bought Ascenta, a tiny engineering company run by chief engineer Andrew Cox, for an estimated £12.5million.

Mr Cox has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun.

Its experts will now be working on drones intended to fly 60,000ft above the earth for months at a time to beam broadband signals to the Third World.

Details of the plan were revealed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in a post on his personal page on the site and form part of a project called Internet.org set up to extend the reach of the internet.

‘In our effort to connect the whole world with Internet.org, we’ve been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky,’ he wrote.

‘Today, we’re sharing some details of the work Facebook’s Connectivity Lab is doing to build drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone.’

New venture: The plans were announced by Mark Zuckerberg on his personal Facebook page today

The Connectivity Lab includes experts from Nasa working on what the company called ‘new aerospace and communications technologies’.

Significantly, Facebook also announced that it had bought Ascenta, which was founded by five Britons who previously worked at major technology firms such as Boeing and Honeywell.

Facebook did not provide any details of the British experts behind Ascenta, while the Somerset-based firm refused requests for interviews and referred questions to its new US owner.

Facebook aims to use a mix of solar-powered aircraft and low-orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard-to-reach locations.

The drones, flying at 60,000ft, will be capable of staying in the air for months at a time.

They are relatively cheap will be best for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals.

The drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on Earth.

Low-orbit and geosynchronous satellites, which have orbits that match the Earth’s rotation and are effectively stationary, will cover more remote areas in Africa and Asia.

The internet access would be transmitted in the form of free-space optical communication, or FSO, which transmits data using infrared laser beams.

It was previously known as High Altitude Engineering and has only two directors, Mr Cox, 51, and his wife Helen.

Mr Cox has had a long career in the aerospace industry. He was a key member of the team at British defence technology company Qinetiq that created the Zephyr drone that holds the record for an unmanned flight, which lasted two weeks.

The team also includes experts who worked on the Breitling Orbiter, a balloon that was designed to circumnavigate the world. Yael Maguire, a director of engineering at Facebook, said Ascenta would join its team working on ‘connectivity aircraft’.

‘We’re looking at a new type of plane architecture that flies at roughly 20,000m, because that’s a point where winds are at their lowest, it’s above commercial airliners, it’s even above the weather, and actually it can stay in the air for months at a time,’ he said.

‘These planes are solar-powered and they sit there and circle around, and have the ability to broadcast internet down.’

Facebook helped found Internet.org last year with other major technology companies such as Samsung and Nokia. It offered no details on how far advanced the drone project was, or any timeframe for completion.
