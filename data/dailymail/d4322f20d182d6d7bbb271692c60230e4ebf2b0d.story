American scientists claim the planet is undergoing one of the largest changes in climate in the past 65 million years.

Climatologists at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct.

If the trend continues at its current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive, they said.

Climatologists at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct and this could have a negative impact on some animals, such as polar bears

The findings come from a review of climate research by Earth system science expert Noah Diffenbaugh and Chris Field, a professor of environmental Earth system science and the director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Institution. The work is part of a special report on climate change in the current issue of Science.

However, the research is part of a 
much bigger picture and other scientists have recently claimed that 
global warming has 'paused' for the time being.

The professors in this latest study reviewed scientific literature on aspects of 
climate change that can affect ecosystems, and investigated how recent 
observations and projections for the next century compare to past events
in Earth's history.

If temperatures continue to rise at their current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species like the giant panda in China will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive, the scientists said

They have claimed global warming has 'paused' but this is not unexpected and temperatures will still continue to rise.

Heat going into the deep ocean is part of the reason global average surface temperatures have increased at a lower rate in the past 10 to 15 years than in previous decades, they explained.

Recent low solar activity and volcanic eruptions, which send particles into the atmosphere that reflect heat, have also contributed to a slowing in temperature rises, while natural climate variations also play a part.

But experts and climate scientists believe global warming has not stopped but paused - with the average rate of warming just 0.04C per decade between 1998 and 2012, compared with 0.17C per decade from 1970-1998.

The scientists said periods of slow-down or 'pauses' in surface warming are not unusual in temperature records and are predicted in climate models, which suggests such periods could occur at least twice a century because of natural variation.

For instance, the planet experienced a sharp rise in temperature by 5
degree Celsius 20,000 years ago, as Earth emerged 
from the last ice age.

This is a change comparable to the high-end of 
the projections for warming over the 20th and 21st centuries, according to the reserachers.

The geologic record shows that, 20,000 years ago, as the ice sheet that covered much of North America receded northward, plants and animals recolonised areas that had been under ice.

As the climate continued to warm, those plants and animals moved northward, to cooler climes.

Professor Diffenbaugh said: 'We know from past changes that ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of global temperature change over thousands of years.

'But the unprecedented trajectory that we're on now is forcing that change to occur over decades.

'That's orders of magnitude faster, and we're already seeing that some species are challenged by that rate of change.'

Some of the strongest evidence for how the global climate system responds to high levels of carbon dioxide comes from paleoclimate studies.

55 million years ago, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was elevated to a level comparable to today, the scientists said.

The Arctic Ocean did not have ice in the summer and nearby land was warm enough to support alligators and palm trees.

'There are two key differences for ecosystems in the coming decades compared with the geologic past,' Professor Diffenbaugh said.

'One is the rapid pace of modern climate change.

'The other is that today there are multiple human stressors that were not present 55 million years ago, such as urbanisation and air and water pollution.'

The professors also examined results from two-dozen climate models to describe possible climate outcomes from present day to the end of the century.

In general, extreme weather events, such as heat waves and heavy rainfall, are expected to become more severe and more frequent.

For example, the researchers said that, 
with continued emissions of greenhouse gases at the high end of the 
scenarios, annual temperatures over North America, Europe and East Asia 
will increase by two to four degrees Celsius between 2046 and 2065.

With that amount of warming, the hottest summer of the last 20 years is expected to occur every other year, or even more frequently.

The scientists claim that by the end of the century, should the current emissions of greenhouse gases remain unchecked, temperatures over the northern hemisphere will be five to six degrees Celcius warmer than today's averages.

Diffenbaugh said: 'It's not easy to intuit the exact impact from annual temperatures warming by six [degrees Celsius].

'This would present a novel climate for most land areas. Given the impacts those kinds of seasons currently have on terrestrial forests, agriculture and human health, we'll likely see substantial stress from severely hot conditions.'

The scientists also projected the velocity of climate change, defined as the distance per year that species of plants and animals would need to migrate to live in annual temperatures similar to current conditions.

Around the world, including much of the United States, species face the need to move toward the poles or higher in the mountains by at least one kilometer per year.
