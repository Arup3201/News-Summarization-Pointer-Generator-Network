An 82-year-old former headmaster today went on trial accused of sexually abusing a group of boys.

Roland Peter Wright denies 15 charges relating to when he was a master then a headmaster at Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, in the 1960s and 1970s.

Wright - who requires regular court breaks because of his age - abused boys in his study bedroom at night time among other places, John Price QC told Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting at Amersham.

Trial: Roland Peter Wright denies 15 charges relating to when he was a master then a headmaster at a school

Mr Price said of one boy at the exclusive school who was 12 or 13 at the time: ‘Late one night he had been asleep in his bed in the dormitory.

‘The master came in, sat on his bed, woke him up and quietly told him to go the master's study bedroom which was nearby. The boy did as he was told.’

Once there the teacher got the boy in bed, the court heard. The boy then allegedly took part in a series of intimate acts with the teacher.

‘This was to happen on several further occasions,’ Mr Price said. ‘The boy recalls that the master was never violent, never threatening.

‘Indeed he recalls that he was “quite
gentle and loving...very softly spoken”. At the time of these events 
the man was a French and sports teacher at the school. He coached the 
first rugby 15.'

One pupil, who is the subject of two current charges, described
him as ‘inspirational’, and told police that he had found Caldicott an ‘extremely
enjoyable, pleasant place to have been, in the main.’

Allegations: Wright abused boys in his study bedroom at night time among other places, John Price QC said

The court heard more than a dozen 
complainants came forward to make historic allegations about Wright. The
indictment refers to seven alleged victims.

Wright,
of Farnham Royal, listens to proceedings with a hearing loop. He denies
13 charges of indecent assault and two counts of inciting youngsters to
commit gross indecency with him.

Witnesses told investigating detectives that the school had ‘an
atmosphere of sexual disinhibition,’ with some children having sexual contact
among themselves, said Mr Price.

'It was in fact not discouraged, but rather was exploited by
this defendant,’ said the barrister.

‘This was a school which catered for boys aged seven to 13
years. If such an atmosphere did establish itself among boys of
that age one is allowed to ask how that should be allowed to happen.’

'The master came in, sat on his bed, woke him up and quietly told him to go the master's study bedroom'

Many of the complainants were only able to report what
happened to them decades later, the court heard, with some telling their wives
and one man going to his doctor.

The jury heard Wright had
committed a range of offences against the boys.

As well as at the school, the abuse was said to have been
carried out on trips to Scotland and in Wright's cottage, where he still lives.

The £20,000-a-year school - which was first based in
Hitchin, Hertfordshire, from 1904 to 1938 - counts Deputy Prime Minister Nick
Clegg among its alumni and has 240 boys aged seven to 13.

Mr Clegg did not 
attend the school when the alleged crimes were committed. Wright, known 
as Peter, is accused of carrying out the offences between September 1959
and August 1970.

Wright was also 
said to have given one boy whisky in his room. ‘He was made to feel 
special,’ Mr Price said. Some of the boys also said another teacher at 
the school, Hugh Henry, abused them.

The court heard that Wright and Henry were friends who used to visit the boys' dormitory together to abuse them.

Two of the alleged 
victims told police that Henry was abusing them on the school grounds 
before he had even been appointed a teacher and was taken to the school 
as Wright's guest.

At 2.30am on June 7 1963, when he was 
part of the staff, Henry was taken from the school by ambulance having 
taken an overdose. Before that he had been found on a boy's bed, the 
court heard.

'An atmosphere of sexual disinhibition (was) exploited by this defendant'

John Price QC

Inquiry documents held by the Department for Education and Skills show he took the overdose for ‘the complete mess he had made of everything at the school’.

One witness told investigators that Henry frequently abused him in the defendant's bedroom during the day. ‘Why did Hugh Henry feel able to make use of that room with such impunity?’ asked the QC.

One man, who was a pupil at the time, told investigators that Wright and Henry were almost caught by their headmaster in their dormitory one night, and had to hide under a bed.

Five complainants came forward against Wright in the early 2000s but criminal proceedings did not result in a trial because of legal reasons, Mr Price said.

But more complaints were made after 2003, when the first investigation fell down, resulting in today's indictment involving seven alleged victims.

However, the jury were told they could hear evidence from the first investigation in support of this prosecution.

‘Twelve men or more do not independently and falsely accuse the same man of doing the same thing,’ said the prosecutor. ‘Such co-incidences do not happen in real life.’

The trial continues tomorrow.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
