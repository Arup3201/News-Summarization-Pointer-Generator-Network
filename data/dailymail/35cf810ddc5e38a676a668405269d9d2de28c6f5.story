A 16-year-old girl was killed during her first drive alone when she veered in front of an oncoming tractor trailer while she sent a text.

State troopers say Savannah Nash of Harrisonville, Missouri, was killed instantly when her PT Cruiser collided with an oncoming semi just two blocks from her home on Thursday.

The crash was in fact so close to home that one of her neighbors reported hearing the horrific impact as both vehicles collided.

Tragic end: Savannah Nash was enjoying her first solo drive less than a week after obtaining her driver's license when authorities say she pulled out in front of a tractor trailer because of texting

T-boned: State troopers say that the 16-year-old failed to yield to this oncoming semi causing it to t-bone her PT Cruiser across the median

Her parents told police that Savannah had gone out to get items for their family dinner that night.

She had only received her driver’s license less than a week ago and was for the first time allowed by her parents to go out on the road alone.

'There was a text message that was on her phone, however it was not sent yet,' Sgt. Bill Lowe of the Missouri State Highway Patrol told Fox4KC. 'That is a probable contributing circumstance to the crash. That’s all part of the investigation.'

At 4.10pm State troopers say the teen pulled out onto Missouri Highway 7 but failed to yield to the oncoming truck traveling at high speeds.

An aerial view of the scene shows her vehicle slammed from the driver's side across the median before coming to rest on the edge of the highway's opposing lanes.

Remembered: Students at Harrisonville High School, where Savannah was a freshman, gathered to remember the girl described as a repeat honor roll student and Future Farmers of America competitor

Authorities say she was wearing her seatbelt but due to the severity of the collision say it wasn't able to provide enough protection.

On Friday students at Harrisonville High School, where Savannah was a freshman, gathered to remember the girl described as a repeat honor roll student and Future Farmers of America competitor, the Kansas City Star reports.

'We will miss your beautiful smile, your laugh and your amazing attitude. You were always nice to me and brightened my day,' a fellow classmate posted on a Facebook page created to remember Savannah. 'All my love toward you and your family. See you someday.'
