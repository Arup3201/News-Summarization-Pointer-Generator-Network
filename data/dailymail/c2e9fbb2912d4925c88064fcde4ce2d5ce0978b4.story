Elsie Watson, who passed away last year, was sent a council tax bill – for a penny

A woman who died last year aged 92 has been sent a council tax bill – for a penny.

Elsie Watson left the paltry debt after moving from Woodley near Stockport into a care home whose staff forwarded the unopened bill to her son Barry Holland. 

The Stockport Council demand, which would have cost 60 times more to post than the penny debt, even offered Mrs Watson the chance to pay instalments.

Barry Holland, 72, of Cheadle Heath, whose wife has paid the bill, has branded the letter 'ludicrous.'

Stockport Council has since admitted their error and apologised.

Mr Holland said: 'It is ludicrous, I really do think it is horrendous that the council can send out letters for a penny to someone who is 92, even if they didn't know she was dead.

'My mum was fiery, I imagine she would have gone down there, thrown a pound at them and said keep the change.

'These people have no knowledge or feelings.

'Whoever sent this has cost 60 times more than a penny with a stamp.

'The bill even said it could be paid in instalments on the back – how is that possible?' 

Mr Holland said his wife Sandra paid the bill just to put an end to the matter.

The Stockport Council demand said Mrs Watson could pay it in instalments. The council have since admitted their error and apologised

Mrs Watson's son Barry Holland, pictured with wife Sandra, said the letter was 'ludicrous' even if his mother was not deceased

Mrs Watson, who had two sons and a daughter as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren, died in August after battling ill health.

She had worked as a cleaner before retiring.

A Stockport Council spokesman said: 'This was an error. Our internal systems let Mrs Watson's family down on this occasion and we apologise to her family for any distress this has caused.' 

Stockport Council (pictured), which sent the bill, suggested it be paid in installments. It has now apologised for the mistake saying its internal systems let Mrs Watson's family down on this occasion
