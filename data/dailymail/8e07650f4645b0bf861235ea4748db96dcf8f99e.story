England football coach Roy Hodgson was the talk of the League Managers Association President’s Dinner after he was upstaged by inspirational speaker Paul McGinley, Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup captain.

Hodgson and McGinley were interviewed on stage by Sky Sports’ David Jones on the subject of leadership. But Hodgson paled next to McGinley, who gave a masterclass at the Lord’s function in explaining the attention to detail, perception and man-management which went into beating the USA at Gleneagles.

It would not have been McGinley’s intention but his thoroughly modern approach to leading a team only exposed Hodgson’s old-school philosophy. And FA technical director Dan Ashworth, plus FA board members David Gill and Heather Rabbatts, would surely have gone away thinking Euro 2016 should be Roy’s last major tournament as England boss.

Certainly any new contract should depend on how England perform in France.

Ireland’s golf team at the Rio 2016 Olympics, including world No 1 Rory McIlroy, will be the next side to benefit from the McGinley factor.

Olympic cycling champion Victoria Pendleton’s seemingly fanciful attempt to learn to ride well enough to compete in next year’s Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham is widely regarded as a Betfair publicity stunt. However, Nina Carberry, winner of the same race yesterday, is one of the few who thinks Pendleton  will be ‘fine’.

Nothing stops record-breaking Irish trainer Willie Mullins at Cheltenham apart from the currency exchange. Mullins has National Hunt’s biggest spenders among his owners yet he withdrew surprisingly at the £200,000 mark in an auction battle with David Pipe for five-year-old Champers On Ice, who went for £205,000 at the Brightwells Cheltenham Festival Sale. Mullins explained the horse had got too expensive in terms of euros, which are struggling against the pound.

The patrons of Cheltenham’s A&R club, grand racing families whose relatives safeguarded the future of the racecourse in the 1960s, have seen their traditional boxes bulldozed to make way for the new £45million grandstand. And the old guard are upset they will not be able to keep bringing food and drink into the new premises. Their main gripe concerns having to pay big prices for ordinary plonk, instead of enjoying their own far superior stuff.

BELL'S FESTIVAL CLANGER 

Rupert Bell, the talkSPORT racing correspondent and brother of royal trainer Michael, did a special commentary on the Festival Charity Race because the station’s betting expert, Coral PR director Simon Clare, was riding. And Bell called Clare, who finished in midfield, as first home because he was riding in similar red colours to the winner. Bell, commentating in overdrive in the belief Clare had triumphed, only realised his error after the field passed the post. talkSPORT still played the gaffe when Clare gave his tips yesterday.

Racing Media Group, ready to let broadcasters tailor their bids for the big meetings in the next TV tender, will find ITV keen to look at screening the Cheltenham Festival. This only adds to the belief that selling the showcase events separately is the most lucrative way forward for racing, especially as viewing figures for Channel 4’s monopoly terrestrial coverage are in steep decline.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s three election rivals will be boosted by the North and Central American confederation, a previous Blatter stronghold, deciding in Philadelphia that their member countries can vote individually for their candidate of choice. This comes a week after South America did not give its expected total support for Blatter at their summit.

BBC Radio 5 Live, paranoid about Cheltenham blunders following presenter John Inverdale’s ‘rose-****** glasses’ slip, found themselves apologising twice for trainer Warren Greatrex’s mild ‘Oh s***’ comment to correspondent Cornelius Lysaght after Cole Harden won the Ladbrokes World Hurdle.
