Argentina coach Gerardo Martino believes Angel di Maria is 'one of the best four or five players in the world' after the winger's stunning performance against Germany on Wednesday night.

Manchester United's £60million summer signing bagged a hat-trick of assists and scored himself as Argentina avenged their World Cup final woe with a 4-2 win against Germany in Dusseldorf.

Di Maria crossed for Sergio Aguero, Erik Lamela and Federico Fernandez all to score before finishing a superb solo run with a delicate chip over Germany goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.

Speaking after the win, Martino said: 'Di Maria is one of the best four or five players in the world and so his performance didn't surprise me.

'His absence there was noticeable,' Martino told a news conference looking back to the World Cup final.

Louis van Gaal will no doubt be hoping Di Maria can replicate such a performance against QPR next week as United look to get a stuttering start to the season back on track.

Germany coach Joachim Low, however, believed Di Maria's presence in the World Cup final wouldn't have stopped his side from winning the tournament. Di Maria missed the defeat after picking up a thigh injury during Argentina's quarter-final win over Belgium. 

Low said: 'We would have beaten them on July 13 even if Di Maria had been playing.

'He couldn't have beaten us on that day.'
