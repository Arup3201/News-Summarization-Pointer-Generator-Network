A fossilised mammoth tusk found on a US building site has been retrieved from a 30ft pit and is on its way to a museum.

Cheers rang out as scientists and building crews used a crane to retrieve the tusk from the pit in Seattle, Washington state, to a waiting lorry.

It measured 8ft 6in, had to be covered in 500lb of plaster for protection, and paleontologist Christian Sidor says it is between 22,000 and 60,000 years old.

Whopper: The tusk was 8ft 6in long and workers first thought it was a pipe or a root

Important find: The fossil has been donated to the Burke Museum and will be one of the most complete in their entire collection - which is mainly made up of fragments

Preserved: The tusk had to be packed in around 500lb of plaster when it was found in order to protect it

The tusk is water-logged, and scientists say properly restoring and preserving it could take at least a year.

Construction workers found the tusk Tuesday, thinking at first that it might be a pipe or a root.

The company building a 118-unit apartment complex at the site has nearly stopped construction to accommodate the scientists.

No more fossils were found during the overnight dig, the museum said Friday.

'Generally tusks like these are the last thing left' after animals and time remove the bones and the rest of the creature, Sidor said.

Stalled: Work on the site stopped while the tusk was removed, but a spokesman for the construction company said the short term loos was worth it for the long term gain

Delicate: The tusk was waterlogged when it was found, and properly preserving it may take a year

Ancient: A paleontologist said the tusk could be between 22,000 and 60,000 years old

The tusk was donated to the Burke Museum at the request of the landowner. The costs of the delay aren't known yet, said Scott Koppelman of AMLI Residential, which also owns apartment complexes to the south and west of the construction site.

The benefits to the community 'outweigh the costs,' he said Thursday.

Mammoths and mastodons were ancient elephant relatives that roamed North American lands that were not covered in ice. Both became extinct as glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age.

Not the first time: Fossilised mammoths have been found several times in Seattle, so much so that it was made Washington's state fossil

Collection: The Burke museum has 25 fossils from King County, including a tooth that was found a few blocks away from the tusk during a different project

Columbian mammoths grew to 12 feet at the shoulder, or about the size of today's Asian elephants, the museum said.

Fossilized mammoth remains have been found numerous times in the Seattle area and across the state, so much so that the Columbian mammoth is the state's official fossil.

Still, most of the Burke Museum's collection is made of fragments. The tusk found this week would be one of the largest and most intact specimens found.

The museum's collection has 25 mammoth fossils from King County, including a tooth that was found a few blocks away from the tusk during a different project.
