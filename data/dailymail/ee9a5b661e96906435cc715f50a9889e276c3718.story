A 'maternity hotel' is charging foreign mothers thousands of dollars so they can give birth to American citizens, it was revealed on Monday.

The popular Santa Anita Inn in Arcadia, California has allegedly been keeping guests who sign up for 'birth tourism' packages in two of its secluded buildings - at a cost of $20,000 for the service. 

Motel guests reportedly have seen women receiving a 'pregnancy service' with 24/7 nurses and meals delivered to their rooms as they prepare to give birth.

The practice has been denied by the motel's owners. The activity is not illegal and is widespread across California.

Sources told KTLA a new 
family arrives every three to four months at the motel. The Santa Anita Inn is a popular 
choice as it has glowing online reviews.

Arcadia city officials said that they were aware what was going on at the Arcadia motel but were powerless to intervene.

Assistant City Manager Jason 
Kruckeberg said: 'A number of the rooms over there are being rented by 
pregnant individuals. They city has been aware of that for quite some 
time.'

The practice is popular with Chinese 
women who travel to the U.S. on tourist visas in order to give birth
 to children who automatically become American citizens.

The practice of 'birth tourism' does not violate federal law but there are dubious ethical issues surrounding the practice.

It is written into the U.S. constitution under the 14th Amendment that those born in the U.S. will be granted citizenship.

According to studies on 'birth tourism' it is popular with wealthy mothers-to-be from several countries including China, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. Although most mothers return home after giving birth, because their child has been born in the U.S., it allows them to get around strict international rules for studying at American colleges.

Once they turn 21, the children can also petition for permanent residency for their parents through family reunification.

The government estimates that there were 7,462 births to foreign residents in 2008. The Center for Immigration Studies said close to  40,000 births each year are to 'birth tourists' - however that number could be as high as 200,000.

The cost of having a so-called 
'anchor 
baby' in America is estimated at $20,000. This includes accommodation, 
care in the weeks running up to the birth and for a month 
afterwards.

Assistance with immigration paperwork is normally included 
in the deal.

The Santa Anita Inn is a pleasant but
 basic establishment offering rooms with satellite TV, wi-fi, 
mini-fridges and coffee-makers. Most rooms have a patio or balcony area.

There
 is also an outdoor swimming pool at the property along with a whirlpool
 jacuzzi and outdoor barbecue. The average cost of one night in a 
king-size room in $89, according to the motel's website.

'Maternity hotels' don't violate federal law - a woman is permitted to travel to the U.S. on a tourist visa and give birth.

'Birth tourism' allows babies born to
 foreign mothers to hold American citizenship - and a host of rights in 
the U.S. including access to education.

The hotels involved in the practice tend to keep a low-profile as they come under fire from campaigners.

A task-force was established last month by the Los Angeles County Board
 of Supervisors after numerous complaints across the state about similar 
establishments.

In Chino Hills last month, a campaign group was set up to oppose 'birth tourism' taking place at a large gated property.

The demonstrators were against the ethical element of 'birth tourism' along with practical issues such as the constant stream of traffic at the site.
