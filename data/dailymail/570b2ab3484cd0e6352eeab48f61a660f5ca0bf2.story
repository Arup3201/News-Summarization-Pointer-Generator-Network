The confident gaze is instantly recognisable, even today. 

This photograph of a 17-year-old Winston Churchill, seen peering over the railings at Harrow School in 1892, is one of the oldest surviving images of our greatest wartime Prime Minister. 

He was far from the ideal scholar. Yet he would achieve greatness – and outlive all but two of his classmates. 

As Allen Packwood from the Churchill Archives Centre says: ‘The great thing is that it captures his rebellious and wilful personality.’ 

The picture is among 90,000 glass plates recently uncovered in a Gloucestershire barn and restored by digital specialist Save Photo. 

They will be on display in London later this year. 

Now, 50 years after Churchill’s death, The Mail on Sunday and historian Lizzie Davies have pieced together what happened to his generation. 

Many died fighting for their country or from disease. 

By the time of his greatest triumph in 1945, more than half had perished.
