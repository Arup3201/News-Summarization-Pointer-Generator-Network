Her flawless beauty has earned her worldwide fame.

But it seems even Cara Delevingne cannot escape the ruthless swipe of the airbrush, if this photograph is anything to go by.

The supermodel appears to have been digitally enhanced in this fashion shoot for lingerie brand, La Perla.

Body overhaul: Cara's bust has been boosted, her bottom and thighs made curvier, and her pale white skin has been bronzed with lots of fake tan for the La Perla campaign, and seen right on holiday in December

The 21-year-old’s bust seems to have been enlarged a cup size, while her usually pearly white skin has been bronzed.

Gone too are her famous tattoos - most notably the one underneath her chest bearing the song lyrics, ‘Don’t worry, be happy’.

The phrase, which is also the title of Bobby McFerrin’s 1988 hit single, was spotted on the model when holidayed in Barbados last month.

According to reports, Cara was given a warning from her modelling agency to stay away from the tattoo chair but she has defied their wishes. 

Among the other seven tattoos on her body are the name of her mother Pandora on the inside of her left elbow, her initials CJD on her hand, and a constellation of stars around her ear.

None of these are visible in her La Perla shoot.

Currently the face of Burberry, Miss Delevingne, has admitted she ‘can’t stop’ adding more tattoos.

Her latest shoot for La Perla comes just five months after H&M reportedly axed her following the emergence of pictures in which she is seen dropping a bag of white powder outside her London flat.
