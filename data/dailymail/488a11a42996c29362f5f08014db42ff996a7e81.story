Guests at The Occidental Grand Xcaret Resort were in for a treat when the X Factor boys stayed at the hotel during the competition's Judges' Houses round.

Mel B was joined by fellow Spice Girl Emma Bunton at the luxury resort in the Riviera Maya where Jake Quickenden, Jordan Morris, Danny Dearden, Paul Akister, Jack Walton and Andrea Faustini performed.

In between rehearsals and filming, the contestants on the ITV talent contest were free to enjoy the resort's ancient Mayan ruins, pristine beaches, high-end spa and incredible dolphinarium.

The former Spice girl and judge also found a little time to explore the stunning Xcaret theme park with its wildlife and underground caves.

The park is named after the nearby archaeological site Xcaret, a settlement constructed by the pre-Columbian Maya some of whose structures lie within the boundaries of the park's 200 acres.

Contestant Paul Akister said: 'It was really hot and amazing - everything about it. I stepped off the plane and then it sort of settled that we were in Mexico and about to sing for Mel B!'

Occidental Grand Xcaret Resort, which has 11 restaurants, nine bars, five swimming pools, and ten Jacuzzis, is located on the Caribbean coastline of Quintana Roo, Mexico, famous for its large-scale all-inclusive resorts.
