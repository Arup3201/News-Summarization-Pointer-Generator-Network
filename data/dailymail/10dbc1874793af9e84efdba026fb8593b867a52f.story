Sir Bradley Wiggins has blamed a lack of 'trust' between him and fellow Tour de France winner Chris Froome after he was dropped from this year's race.

The Tour will roll through the Olympic gold medallist's home city of London for the first time in seven years next month - but he will not be taking part.

Instead the cyclist said Team Sky is rallying round his teammate Froome, who won last year's tour and who he has not raced with all year.

Criticism: The admission came a day after Froome said he sensed metal weakness in Sir Bradley during his 2012 triumph (pictured). He was the first Briton to win the Tour - but was followed by Froome last year

Yesterday Team Sky insisted a final decision on team selection 
would not be made until the end of this month - but Sir Bradley broke ranks, saying his future there could be in doubt.

He told the BBC: 'The team is focused around Chris Froome... I
 am gutted. I've worked extremely hard for this all winter and I feel I 
am in the form I was two years ago. Now if I want to go to the Tour 
again, the reality is that I might have to go elsewhere.'

However, he added: 'I also understand that cycling is a team sport and it is all about Team Sky winning and Chris is defending champion.'

He said Chris Froome had a strong group of riders behind him, some of whom were good enough to win the race themselves.

‘For
 the dynamic of the team, Chris has a say and we haven’t raced together 
all year,' he said. 'When you’re in the heat of the moment, you need guys you can 
trust and who have been there for you. Tensions can rise between two 
riders.'

Tension: The pair together last year. Both are among the most successful team cyclists in British history

Sources 
close to the pair say the atmosphere is ‘dreadful’ when they are 
together, with Froome, 29, sometimes ‘intimidated’ by a colleague of 34-year-old 
Wiggins’s stature.

The riders were involved in public spats after the 2012 Tour, though they said they had cleared the air and resolved their differences at a training camp last year.

With his 
contract expiring this year, Sir Bradley said he is considering his future 
at Team Sky having ‘spoken to a few people’ linked to rival teams.

‘Having
 missed the Tour again this year, I wouldn’t like to leave it there,’ 
said Sir Bradley, who also has his sights on a return to the track for the 
2016 Olympics in Brazil.

'I’d love to go back at some point so there is the
 chance that I would go back to the Tour next year.

Claims: Froome said he sensed mental weakness in his teammate during his 2012 Tour win (pictured)

Skilled: Sir Bradley said Froome (pictured) had a good team around him and accepted it was a team sport

He said he had spoken to the Orica-GreenEdge team about joining them next season.

The Tour will be in Britain for three days from July 5, starting in Leeds and whisking through Harrogate, York, Sheffield, Cambridge and London.

Sir Bradley's comments came a day after Froome claimed he had sensed 'mental weakness' in his teammate during the 2012 Tour.

Asked
 whether the comments angered him, Sir Bradley told the BBC: 'No, not really. Books 
get written all the time in this day and age and there seems to be a 
different book out every week. It's two years ago now.'

But
 he added: 'One of the things with the Tour de France is you're on the 
road for one month with a group of guys and you're going to have 
different emotions, different mood swings.

Home soil: The 2014 Tour de France will kick off in Yorkshire next month, where Froome is pictured training

'A
 friend of mine from the rugby world said "I could do it for 90 minutes,
 I couldn't do it for four weeks", and I think that summed it up for 
me.'

A senior figure in cycling, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘If
 Brad doesn’t ride it will be a disaster for the sport in this country.

'Here was a chance to showcase the 
sport here in England with the last two winners of the Tour, who are 
both British.

'But because they don’t get on, the one who’s most popular 
with the fans is not going to be there. It’s embarrassing.'
