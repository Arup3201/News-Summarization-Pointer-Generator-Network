Labour MP Jamie Reed insisted he had not intended to be offensive with his tweets

A Labour frontbencher has been forced to apologise after using Twitter to make jokes about a woman’s moustache.

Shadow health minister Jamie Reed was updating his 19,000 followers about an ‘obnoxious’ passenger on his train when he asked is she was 'growing that for Movember’ - the cancer charity event which encourages men to grow a moustache in November.

But the Copeland MP was bombarded with abuse by Twitter users, branding him a ‘sexist clown’.

Travelling to London from his constituency in Cumbria, Mr Reed wrote: ‘On the train down, opposite an incredibly obnoxious and opinionated woman (you people) my withering glances were not enough. Had to do more.’

He then added: ‘As she slagged off the train guard I simply looked at her and asked: 'Are you growing that for Movember?' Am I right? Yeah? Who's with me?’

As users accused him of not valuing his constituents’ votes and being unable to trust him, he the tweeted: ‘I didn't actually do that. But trust me, what a horror.’

Mr Reed received several angry replies from other Twitter users.

Sarah Ledger ‏@sezl wrote: ‘it suggests that women can only be valued for their appearance.’

Emma Burnell @Scarletstand commented: "What a shame you chose to denigrate her appearance when it was her behaviour that was at issue.#stayclassy"

Poet of the Deed @planetcath said: ‘Very tiring hearing people who should know better make personal remarks about a woman's appearance. Helps no one.’

Eddy39 @Eddy39 said: ‘What a sexist clown you are #labour #justsaying’

But the MP defended his post, saying it was only meant as a joke.

Mr
Reed later posted: ‘Just to point out, I really don't believe that's 
sexist in any way shape or form. Don't see how it can be. Poor joke? 
Yes. Sexist? No.’

Another
use, Steve @stevenaturner, then posted: ‘Firestorm! You do represent 
people for a living. Delete the tweet and apologise, it wasn't big or 
clever. We all make mistakes.’

In response Mr Reed posted: "No point in deleting - but have already taken back. Absolutely no intention to offend.'

Mr Reed yesterday defended his use of Twitter: ‘It's the nature of social media that some people will pick fights, criticise, honestly misunderstand and in some cases seek deliberate offence with whatever is written. This is another example of par for the course. 

‘We undoubtedly live in a sexist society and I am working to change that as a Labour MP,’ he told the North West Evening Mail.

'I always have done, and I always will. I want exactly the same opportunities for my wife, daughter, mother and sisters as any man has - all of my work shows that and it's knowingly untrue for anyone to suggest otherwise.'
