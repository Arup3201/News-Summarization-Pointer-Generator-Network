A U.S. company today infuriated Liverpool football fans by replacing the Hillsborough memorial flames in the club crest with iced coffee cups as part of a Twitter campaign.

Dunkin' Donuts asked supporters to suggest redesigns for the badge, and presented its own version last night - which featured the cups in place of the red flames either side of the crest.

The Massachusetts-based firm, which has since apologised for 'any insensitivity', later took down the tweet and ended the campaign - but not before its 'ignorance' was criticised by fans of the club.

Campaign: Dunkin' Donuts asked supporters on Twitter to suggest redesigns for the badge, and presented its own version last night - which featured the cups in place of the red flames either side of the crest

Remember: The eternal flame represented in the crest burns at the centre of the Hillsborough memorial at the club's Anfield Stadium

Its version of the badge also used doughnuts and a coffee cup to replace the Shankly Gates that represent late manager Bill Shankly - and the 'established' year was switched from 1892 to 1950.

The company also replaced the Liver bird - which is taken from the city's coat of arms, and has been the central feature of the club's badge for more than 110 years - with the Dunkin' Donuts logo.

Liverpool fan Michael Evans said on Twitter: 'You don't mess with the eternal flame on the club's crest. If you don't get that, you've no business being anywhere near LFC, Dunkin' Donuts.'

Another fan calling himself 'Stevelfc1' tweeted: 'I can appreciate the light hearted intention of the Dunkin' Donuts badge thing but to replace the flames with milkshakes shows pure ignorance.'

And Jim Boardman, who writes about the club for various publications, said: 'As a company, with guidance from LFC, they should have been aware and staff on that campaign briefed.'

Anger: The Massachusetts-based firm's 'ignorance' was criticised by fans of the Premier League club

Unimpressed: Liverpool fan Michael Evans said nobody should 'mess with the eternal flame' on the crest

Who was behind it? This Twitter user questioned if an official at Liverpool may have approved the campaign

Change: In 2012 the badge on the shirts was replaced with the stand-alone Liver bird on a new kit designed by U.S. company Warrior (pictured, being worn by Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Mario Balotelli)

Liverpool announced a multi-million-pound partnership with Dunkin' Donuts in January 2014 that saw it become the 'official coffee, tea and bakery provider' for the Premier League team.

The company also works with US baseball teams Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, New York Mets and Tampa Bay Rays, and American football outfits Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots.

Fourteen in Britain: Dunkin Donuts has more than 10,500 restaurants in 31 countries around the world

A spokesman for Dunkin' Donuts said: 'We apologise for any insensitivity regarding our tweet supporting an LFC-themed promotion featuring the LFC crest.

'As a proud partner of LFC, we did not intend any offence, particularly to the club's supporters. We have removed the tweet and halted the campaign immediately.'

Dunkin Donuts has more than 10,500 restaurants in 31 countries around the world - including 14 in Britain, all in the South East. In 2013 it announced plans to develop 150 restaurants in the UK.

The Hillsborough disaster saw 96 Liverpool supporters die at the FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in April 1989 at Sheffield Wednesday.

A series of inquests into the deaths was launched in March 2014 in Warrington, Cheshire, after the High Court quashed verdicts in the original hearings. These are still ongoing.

The version of the badge featured in the Dunkin' Donuts campaign appeared on the club's shirts between 1992 and 2012 - but is still used on the club's website.

In 2012 the badge on the shirts was replaced with the stand-alone Liver bird on a new kit designed by American company Warrior.

It prompted an angry response from families of those killed at Hillsborough because it dropped the flames - but this new crest is still used today.

A Liverpool spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment today from MailOnline.
