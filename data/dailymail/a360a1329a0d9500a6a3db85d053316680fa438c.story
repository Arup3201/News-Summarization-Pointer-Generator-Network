Pornography websites are no longer the most 'dangerous' places on the web when it comes to picking up viruses.

Security experts Symantec released their annual report on the state of malicious software, and pornographic sites now rank 10th as the riskiest to visit.

In top place are blogs and other 'web communication' sites, of which 20% are infected.

Pornography

A mere 2% of pornographic sites are infected - a major turnaround for the internet, where the 'grey' world of porn used to be synonymous with virus infection.

But with malicious software increasingly delivered via infected code injected into 'innocent' websites via adverts or other means, it seems cyber-crooks have deserted pornographic sites.

15% of web hosting sites are infected, and 10% of general business sites.

Spam emails have also dropped down the list as a means of delivery, with 13% fewer than 2010 - and most using links to infected websites, rather than files within an email.

The rate of malicious software infection is increasing - especially on mobile.

'Symantec blocked a total of over 5.5 billion malware attacks in 2011, an 81% increase over 2010. Web based attacks increased by 36% with over 4,500 new attacks each day,' said the company.

The number of new viruses, worms and trojans also increased, with 403 million new variants of malware were created in 2011, a 41% increase of 2010.

Symantec also warn that computer users who considered themselves 'safe' are not - with Mac users now being targeted by virus writers.

Mobile phone users were also increasingly the targets of virus attacks - mobile vulnerabilities continued to rise, with 315 discovered in 2011.
