The grandmother of a four-year-old girl who died when she crashed a motorbike she was forced to ride around her backyard has accused child protection officers of repeatedly ignoring her reports of child abuse.

Chloe Valentine died from massive injuries in January 2012 after repeatedly crashing the motorbike she was forced to ride by her mother and her partner at their Adelaide home.

Chloe's mother, Ashlee Polkinhorne, 22, and her ex-partner Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in prison after pleading guilty to the little girl's manslaughter by neglect. A coroner's inquest is now investigating the death.

Belinda Valentine, the grandmother of Chloe Valentine, outside South Australia's Coroners' Court in Adelaide on Friday. Ms Valentine has told the inquiry her repeated attempts to warn authorities about Chloe's neglect at the hands of her parents were ignored. 

Polkinghorn's mother, Belinda Valentine, broke down while giving evidence at the inquest on Friday, as  she detailed her  attempts to have Chloe removed from her daughter's care.

Ms Valentine said she repeatedly contacted Families SA to voice concerns about her daughter's neglect of the child, her drug-taking, alcohol abuse and Chloe's 'filthy' living conditions.

She said that when she offered  to take Chloe into her care, a senior social worker told her: 'You have no right to take Chloe anywhere.

'I was really shocked - it gave Ashlee all the power to do basically whatever she wanted to do,'she said.  

Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012

The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her mother, who fell pregnant at 15. Despite more than 20 notifications made to Families SA since Chloe's birth, she was never removed from her mother's care by authorities.

Ms Valentine says her daughter repeatedly threatened her, saying she would never see Chloe again if she spoke of taking her.

'She hated Families SA,' said Ms Valentine, adding that her daughter complained about them always interfering and describing them as 'a joke.'

Ms Valentine told the court she often confronted her daughter about her  behaviour. On one occasion she went to rescue her and Chloe after an incident of domestic abuse.

She found Chloe shaking and cowering in a corner and described how she, 'just clung to me, buried her head in my shoulder.'

When Ms Valentine suggested Chloe should come to her home for a while, Polkinghorne became hysterical. 

'She said I was trying to steal her child ... that I was trying to interfere.'

Ms Valentine said she rang Families SA but the social worker said she had no right to take Chloe.

In December, the Coroner's Court heard how Chloe had suffered massive head injuries, cuts and bruises after being forced to ride the motorbike, repeatedly crashing, over a three day period in January 2012.

In giving evidence to the court, social worker Tara Liston said she had struggled with her workload and had more severe cases than Chloe's in 2011.

She told the court Chloe and her mother 'engaged really well', the ABC reported at the time.

'In comparison to other cases, when you read it, there were some things that Ashlee did well and there were other times that she didn't... it would be a case that was not as significant as other cases,' she had said. 

Other claims previously made in court by three people - including Jay Rann who was the child's respite carer - said Polkinghorne left sex toys and drugs around the house, called her daughter a 'c***' and also fed Chloe Hungry Jack's and spent her welfare money on herself.

The court also heard allegations that the bathroom walls at Chloe's home was covered with 'dried faeces', according to The Advertiser. They also claimed Chloe sang 'I want a horny daddy'.

Benjamin Robert McPartland, ex-parter of Chloe's mother Ashlee Polkinghorne, leaves the SA Supreme Court in 2013. He is in prison after pleading guilty to Chloe's manslaughter through criminal neglect.

On December 1, social worker Katrina Heading told the inquest she considered removing Chloe when she was 16-months-old in November 2008 after her 'paralytic' mother left her with a 15-year-old friend while she drank at the beach. 

Ms Heading said Chloe was sent home unsupervised with a private chauffeur because there were only two crisis care staff working that night.

She said the chauffeur company conducted police checks on its workers but Families SA did not have access to those checks.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned whether it was appropriate for a 16-month-old child to be left unsupervised with a private driver.

She asked why Ms Heading had not pushed harder to have Chloe removed, given Families SA had received multiple abuse notifications.

'You knew that this woman had left her child with a 15-year-old so that she could consume alcohol ... that's concern enough, isn't it?' she asked.

Ms Heading said she had backed her supervisor's judgement, despite having reservations about Polkinghorne.  

Chloe died from massive head injuries after she was forced to ride a motorbike over a three-day period that repeatedly crashed at her Adelaide home

Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old.

After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. 

Earlier in the inquest, evidence revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house.

One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food.

It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends.

In October, social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs.

Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months

Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 

Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home.

The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking.

Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, also told the inquest in October that Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house.

Ms Stewart said she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17.  

The inquest continues.
