Fabian Delph has claimed that him signing a new four-and-a-half year deal deal at Aston Villa proves that loyalty still exists in football.

The 25-year-old's previous deal expired in the summer and Liverpool were rumoured to be interested in the midfielder.

But Delph chose to stay with Villa, a move he says should restore faith in footballers.

Speaking on a video released by the club on Sunday, Delph said: 'It's been a roller-coaster ride since I've been here - I've enjoyed every minute of it.

'The fans have stuck by since day one. The chairman's stuck by me, he's been unbelievable with me. The gaffer's been great as well.

'I'm proving that there still is loyalty in football. I've decided to stay here and I'll give nothing less than 100 per cent every game. 

'I'd love you guys to get behind us and support the boys.' 

Speaking to Villa's official website, he added: 'The club has given me a great platform to perform and a great opportunity to showcase what I can do.

'The fans have been great with me, the chairman has been absolutely fantastic with me and I have a great relationship with the manager and I see the boys here as my brothers, my family and I am delighted to stay here.

Villa manager Paul Lambert has made sure that Liverpool cannot sign Delph for free during the summer

'I am a loyal person and committing my future will hopefully show everybody what type of guy I am.

'I feel like this is me - I love the club, I love being here and I want to put 100 per cent into everything I do here. This is my club and I want to be here. That's why I am committing my future.

'Hopefully it will give everyone a bit of a lift and show the fans that we are looking to do big things here and bring excitement back to the club.

'We want to get through this season, do well and I feel the up-and-coming years will be big. There was no way I was going to bail out. I am here for the long run.

'The fans have been the same. I am sure they will stick with us, help us get through this season and then looking into the future, it looks promising to me.'

Manager Lambert added: 'It's great for Aston Villa. It's great for Fabian. I think this is a massive, massive step.

'The thing with modern day football and loyalty is there's not so much of it - you very rarely get people who stay at a football club for a long, long time.

'Obviously Fabian has been here a fair few years now. His first few years he was injured as a young guy but since I have been here - the three years - he's been terrific for us. He's been great. His performances have been excellent.

'When you get someone like Fabian - who might have had the possibility of going elsewhere to pastures new - to have him commit is a massive, massive coup for us.

'No-one expected it. I think everyone thought Fabian was going to go and we would have to get someone else in. I don't think anyone saw this coming.

'But it's been something we've been trying to do, as I have always said. He enjoys his football and being at the club.'
