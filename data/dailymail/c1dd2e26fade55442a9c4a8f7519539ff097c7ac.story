A former West Point cadet has lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against members of R&B singer Patti LaBelle's entourage whom he accused of beating him as he waited for a ride outside a Houston airport terminal.

In his lawsuit, Richard King alleged he was attacked without provocation by LaBelle's bodyguard and two others while waiting outside Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2011. King had just arrived in Houston, his hometown, while on spring break from West Point.

After five days of testimony and 10 hours of deliberation, a federal jury in Houston on Tuesday night absolved Zuri Edwards, LaBelle's manager and son; Efrem Holmes, her bodyguard; and Norma Harris, her hairdresser.

She won: Soul singer Patti LaBelle arrives at the federal courthouse for jury selection September 16. in Houston. A former West Point cadet has lost a lawsuit he filed against LaBelle and her entourage saying she ordered her bodyguards to beat him up as he waited for a ride home outside a Houston airport terminal in 2011

LaBelle, 70, had been dropped from the suit early in the trial.

John Raley, one of King's lawyers, told jurors that King was minding his own business outside the airport terminal when he was attacked without provocation by the 400-pound Holmes, as well as by Edwards and Harris. Raley said King had to drop out of West Point because of a traumatic brain injury he suffered when he hit his head on a concrete pillar during the attack.

Geoffrey Bracken, one of LaBelle's attorneys, told jurors that King was the aggressor who first punched Edwards. LaBelle's attorneys have said King hurled racial insults at the singer before he attacked her son and that King was told several times to step away from the singer's vehicle after he tried to open a passenger door.

Bracken blamed King's drinking for the incident and suggested that King's career at West Point was ended not by his injuries but by a previous history of poor academic performance. Raley said King had a blood alcohol level of 0.28 - more than three times the legal limit for driving - but that King was not driving and was no danger to anyone.

Jurors viewed surveillance video of the brawl that included Labelle posing for a fan photo with a police officer beside a puddle of King's blood.

LaBelle, whose singing career has spanned more than four decades and includes several hit records and two Grammy Awards, took the stand for about 30 minutes last week. 

She testified that she rolled down the window in her limousine to ask her bodyguard if all of their luggage had arrived since the flight had been delayed for over an hour, not to give instructions to assault King, as the plaintiff alleged.

Lost: King claimed he suffered irreparable brain injury from the altercation and subsequently had to drop out of West Point, but a jury didn't see it his way

'I take pictures with anyone and everyone who asks': An attorney for King asked whether LaBelle's posing for photographs with the officers could have influenced the investigation into the melee

The singer said she did not see what happened after King punched her son, Zuri Edwards, who is also her manager.

'After seeing my son beat up, I didn't want to look any more,' LaBelle said when she was asked to explain why she didn't see the whole incident.

A Harris County jury acquitted LaBelle's bodyguard, Efrem Holmes, of charges stemming from the melee in 2013.

An attorney for King asked whether LaBelle's posing for photographs with the officers could have influenced the investigation into the melee.

'It could have been a homeless person, dear. I take pictures with anyone and everyone who asks,' LaBelle replied.

LaBelle said she heard King use a racial slur, but that words, even if offensive, did not warrant a physical attack.

'I've been doing this for 52 years and I've heard all kinds of things and I don't react,' LaBelle said.
