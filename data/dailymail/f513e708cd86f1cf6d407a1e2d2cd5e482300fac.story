The New York Jets have revealed that not only did cornerback Dimitri Patterson fail to show up for Friday's preseason game against the Giants but that they have no idea where he is.

General manager John Idzik and head coach Rex Ryan admitted Patterson's disappearance to reporters Sunday, not long after the 31-year-old Patterson failed to make the day's practice.

'I'd like to speak to Dimitri," Idzik told reporters. 'Again, I don’t want to 
speculate on anything until I have a direct conversation with anyone, 
much less the player, just to figure out what’s going on. So we really 
don’t know. We can only surmise and we don’t want to speculate.'

Patterson was considered the likely starter at his position though he missed the preseason opener two weeks ago due to calf, quad, and ankle injuries, NJ.com reports.

His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said his Patterson would report to the team by late Sunday but would not comment further. 

The team only knows that Patterson is physically in good condition through Rosenhaus, but that the cornerback had given no one any notice or reason why he might stop appearing.

Patterson was signed to a one-year contract with incentives worth up to $3 million this April

He was last with the team Friday for the pre-game meal, meetings, but failed to appear for the game at MetLife Stadium.

Deadspin reports that Patterson was signed to a one-year contract with incentives worth up to $3 million this April.

Idzik does not believe Patterson to be in any legal trouble but said the team would have to handle the matter internally.

Patterson agents told reporters his client was physically safe but declined any further comment

He did not say what, if any, response management may have discussed.

Ryan told reporters the disappearance shocked him.

'I still feel that way,' Ryan said. 'I'm not real comfortable talking
 about it until we talk to Dimitri and find out what's going on.'
