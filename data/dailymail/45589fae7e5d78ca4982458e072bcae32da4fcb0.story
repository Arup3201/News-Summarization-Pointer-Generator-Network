Wants flow of money: Former Welsh Water boss John Elfed Jones says Wales should be making a profit from supplying water to England

Drought-hit England should be made to pay for using water from Wales, the former head of Welsh Water claimed today.

As millions of English households are slapped with hosepipe bans, John Elfed Jones argues that water is a business and, like oil, should be sold to make money.

His comments came as Severn Trent, which supplies mid Wales, announced plans to sell water to Anglian Water without at cost price.

But speaking to Welsh-language programme Taro Naw, broadcast on S4C last night, Mr Jones said: 'Is it fair Wales isn't profiting a penny from the water which is exported to England?

'In 50 years, will our people look back and ask why didn't we invest years ago?

'It's about time we took this option seriously.

'It's a lack of energy and vision which leads us to be in difficulties often.'

Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru say that powers over Wales' natural resources should be devolved to politicians in Cardiff Bay.

A current hosepipe ban affects 20 million people in England who get their water from seven companies.

They are: Thames Water, Southern Water, South East Water, Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East.

The ban has sparked debate over whether transferring water from regions, such as upland areas of Wales, should be carried out.

Severn Trent has since announced plans were being drawn up to supply more than 100,000 homes in the worst-hit areas.

It aims to sell 30 million litres of water a day to Anglian Water, one of the seven companies that imposed a hosepipe ban at the beginning of April to help ease the shortage.
