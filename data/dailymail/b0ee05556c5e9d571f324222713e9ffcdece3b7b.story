On an evening when cross-city rivals Manchester City were sent crashing out of Europe, United record signing Angel di Maria resisted revelling in their exit to take a stroll with wife Jorgelina Cardoso.

The reigning Premier League champions failed to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth consecutive season - losing 1-0 to a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona at the Nou Camp, although without City keeper Joe Hart the scoreline would have been more damaging.

Di Maria and his wife have endured a difficult introduction to Manchester after a failed attempt to burgle their home while the family, including young daughter Mia, were inside saw them leave in search of safer accommodation.

Things on the pitch have been equally challenging for the 27-year-old who has struggled for form in recent months and was suspended for United's 3-0 victory over Tottenham on Sunday, where Louis van Gaal's side arguably delivered their best performance of the season.

Di Maria will be available for United's eagerly anticipated clash with Liverpool on Sunday as both teams compete for a top-four finish that will bring Champions League football next season. 

However, former Old Trafford captain Bryan Robson believes the manager faces a decision over whether to bring his £60million record signing straight back into the team.

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: 'It is a big call for Louis van Gaal.

'You have to look at the situation. Certain away games are a lot tougher than your home matches. You go for more attacking flair in a home game whilst away you do try and get more of a balance where you have defensive security and then you counter attack.

'Angel has had ups and downs. Like everybody else he has had some periods when he's played really well and then some poor performances. He is no different to anybody else.

'It has taken him time to settle into the English game, getting used to the manager and his formations. Foreign players do need time. And on occasions a chance to watch from the stands is not a bad thing.
