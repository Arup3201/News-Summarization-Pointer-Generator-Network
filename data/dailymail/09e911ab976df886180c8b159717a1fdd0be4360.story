Mikel Arteta has revealed that he spoke to David Moyes about Real Sociedad before he took the job in La Liga.

Moyes, 51, was confirmed as the Basque side's new boss on Monday, and used to work with the Spanish midfielder at Everton.

And Arteta, now captain at Arsenal, admits that while Moyes had 'doubts' about his next move after leaving Manchester United last April, he expects him to excel at Sociedad.

Moyes was appointed as Real Sociedad's new manager on Monday

'I gave him my opinion about la Real,' he told Cadena Ser

'He's a coach that likes to tighten the reigns, he'll do well with the group. He demands a lot and works hard, he's not what you'd call a 'typical' English manager that sits on the bench.

'He analyses a lot and he has a clear idea of how he wants his team to play.

'There are things (like the language barrier or knowledge of Spanish football) that could have an adverse effect, but when he made the decision to come to Real Sociedad over the other offers he had, it's because he sees their potential moving forward.'

Arteta himself used to play for Sociedad, though he did not make the grade before coming to Britain as a youngster.

And the 32-year-old, whose contract at Arsenal runs out in the summer, has praised Moyes'man motivation skills.

He added: 'If he's not able to get the team moving forward from the start, it's going to hurt him. I wish him the best, he's a coach that can light a fire under a player and the player will fight to the death for him. He's a coach that deserves it.'
