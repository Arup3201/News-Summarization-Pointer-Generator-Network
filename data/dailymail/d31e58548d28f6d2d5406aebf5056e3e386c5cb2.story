A man from Florida is accused of calling 911 twice after being pulled over for speeding in an effort to get the officer to go to a hoax emergency.

Julius Lupowitz, 52, tried to get out of his ticket by being creative and called 911 telling them there was about to be a shooting.

Dispatchers on the 911 lines took the frantic phone call. In one call he is heard telling the operator: 'There is a murder that’s going to happen, I swear, on Wingate and Wickham. No, on Wingate and Hollywood.

Not the brightest! Florida police say Julius Lupowitz, 52, called 911 to make fake reports of a possible murder in progress as he was being pulled over for a traffic violation

Definitely someone going to get shot. Please, please, Wingate and Hollywood. Please,' the man said.

When the line went dead, every available officer went to that intersection in West Melbourne, Florida.

Then Lupowitz called called back.

'I swear, there's gonna be a murder any second. There's a man with a gun. Please, I just called.'

Again, the caller hung up. Dispatchers looked for any information they could get and got the caller’s name.

The idea almost worked as Lupowitz was able to have officers sent over to the fake murder scene - but the officer who pulled him over stayed put.

Any excuse: Dispatchers on the 911 lines took a frantic phone call but the police officer realized soon enough that the person who was making the call was the driver he had just pulled over

It wasn't long before the name of the 911 caller was announced over the police radio - which the officer realized was the same person he had pulled over, just up the street form where the reported murder was taking place.

Police believe that while the officer’s back was turned, Lupowitz made the phony murder calls.

'It almost worked,' West Melbourne, FL Police Lt. Rich Cordeau said. 'The officer was trying to wrap up quickly to respond. We responded as if it was real. We don’t know any different until we got there.'

'When you take a phony incident, and you take those dispatches away from the ability to answer those calls that could put somebody that has a real emergency in danger,' Cordeau said.

'Our officer was standing at the door of Mr. Lupowitz’s vehicle and realized, at that point, that this was the same person that was making the 911 calls,' said Lt. Cordeau.

Instead of a $200 speeding ticket, Lupowitz faces a felony charge that carries a maximum 5-year prison term.

Used to making selfies: Instead of facing a speeding charge and a fine of $200, Lupowitz now faces a felony charge and the prospect of five years behind bars
