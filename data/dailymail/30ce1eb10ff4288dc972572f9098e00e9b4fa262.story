An SUV jumped the curb on a busy stretch of sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan Friday afternoon.

The ensuing crash injured six people - including an 11-month-old baby who was in critical condition with a head injury, officials said.

The driver of a Chevy TrailBlazer was heaving south on Fifth Avenue when they somehow lost control of the vehicle and jumped onto the sidewalk outside a Barnes & Noble bookstore at West 46th Street.

Crash in Midtown Manhattan: A car crashed at 5th Avenue and West 46th Street, injuring six people - including a small child

11-month-old injured: A baby in the stroller was struck by the careening car and is in critical condition at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where the baby is said to be improving

Cause unknown: Investigators were unsure what caused the car to jump the curb, but are investigating Friday's heavy rains as a factor

The car hit a family with a small baby in a stroller.

Ron Rivas, 40, was walking nearby when he witnessed the crash and called 911.

'All of a sudden this car came out of nowhere and smacked into the family and their friend. The father went flying. The lady that was with them was injured,' Rivas told the New York Post.

Rivas toldÂ NBC New York that the stroller was destroyed, 'I mean, it was completely shattered.'

But the baby, 'with the exception [of] being red and crying when they pulled him out, looked fine,' Rivas said.

According to Rivas and other witnesses, employees inside the bookstore rushed out to help and stayed until emergency responders arrived a few minutes later.

The five adults injured in the crash were taken to Bellevue Hospital with non-life threatening injuries and the baby was taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital in critical condition to be treated for a head injury, officials say.

According to NBC New York, the infant's condition is said to be improving.

'The way that car came careening in, it's a miracle that no one died,' Rivas said.

The driver of the vehicle is facing no criminal charges. Investigators are unsure what caused the driver to lose control but are looking into Friday's heavy rains as a potential factor.
