RIP: The world's smallest bodybuilder Romeo Dev died this morning after his diagnosed brain aneurism ruptured

The world's smallest bodybuilder died this morning aged just 23.

The family of Aditya ‘Romeo’ Dev, who was 2ft 9ins tall and weighed just 10kg, said he had been 'absolutely fine' before he collapsed last night.

He was rushed to  Satyam Hospital in Punjab, India, where doctors fought to save him. Sadly he died at 4am this morning.

Mr Dev was diagnosed with a brain
aneurism in 2008. U.S. doctors also diagnosed Moyamoya 
syndrome, a disease where certain arteries in the brain are constricted causing blood clots.

Doctors had warned Mr Dev that his aneurism could burst without warning at any time, leading to a fatal stroke.

Today Mr Dev's father Anil Dev Sharma, 53, and his mother Rakesh Bala, 49, spoke of their devastation at their son's death.

Mr Sharma said: 'He was absolutely fine until last night when he suddenly fell unconscious. We rushed him to the hospital and he fell into a coma, he was unconscious all night. Doctors said the nerve supplying blood to his brain had ruptured, causing his death.

'It's a huge loss for our family, we will be grieving his death for the rest of our life. We were told by doctors many years ago that he may die at an early age. All these years we prayed for his long life.'

Doctor Neeraj Chandan, one of the doctors treating Romeo all night at Satyam Hospital, said: 'He was brought to the hospital in an unconscious state. It was due to massive bleeding which had caused brain damage or aneurism bleeding. There were very rare chances of him surviving.'

Mr Dev's best friend, Maninder Singh, 19, used to go to the gym together. He said: 'His death was a shocking moment, I just can't believe he's died. We never thought this day would come so soon. His small bat, his bikes and his bedroom at his home are only memories of him now.'

He said at the time: 'I earn good money through my dance and bodybuilding shows but being rich doesn't interest me.

'My dream is to travel a lot - I want to perform in London with my idol, Jazzy-B.'
