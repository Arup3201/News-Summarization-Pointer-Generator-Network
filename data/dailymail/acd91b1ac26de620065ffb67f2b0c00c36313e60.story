Comedian Rory Bremner led tributes yesterday to satirist John Fortune, who has died at 74.

Fortune, who recently had a stroke, found fame on the Channel 4 show Bremner, Bird And Fortune.

Bremner said Fortune had satirised subjects such as the banking crisis long before they became topical.

The comedian John Fortune died today at the age of 74 after a television career spanning more than 50 years

Fortune and comedy partner John Bird met at Cambridge University in the 1960s.

They became famous for The Long Johns sketches in which they lampooned politicians and military top brass.

Bremner
 said: 'He was fearless as a  satirist because there was nothing he 
wouldn't do. He was a father figure and a mentor to me.

'Some of the happiest and most fulfilling times of my life are working with The Two Johns as they became known.

'In a quiet way, he was one of the pillars of the anti-establishment.

'He
 was braver than many of us in what he would do in a satirical sketch. 
To my mind he was the best combination of intelligence and humour that I
 have ever met.'

Bird and Fortune met in Cambridge where the comedian went after studying at Bristol University. Fortune starred in the 1984 programme Crown Court (right)

The veteran actor appeared in countless British comedy programmes for which he wrote satirical script. He is pictured in the 1992 programme, The Good Guys

Fortune, a father-of-three, passed away peacefully with his wife Emma and dog Grizelle at his bedside, his agent said.

In
 1997 he won a Bafta for his work on Rory Bremner, Who Else? He was also
 nominated four times for Baftas between 1999 and 2003.

Friend
 and long-time producer Geoff Atkinson described Fortune as 'unique', 
adding: 'He was a joy to work with, an inspiration as a writer and the 
funniest person you could ever meet. But it was as a friend that I 
valued him most.

'He steered and shaped the shows we made and it was his soul that sat at the heart of what we did.'

Stephen Fry tweeted: 'Oh how sad. He was in the first play I was ever in, 40 Years On. Huge influence on the satire boom.'

Paying tribute to his friend and former colleague, Rory Bremner today described the actor as 'a brilliant and fearless satirist'
