Armed robbers left a trail of blood and destruction as they rampaged through a shopping mall in South Africa, leaving seven people injured.

Two of those hurt were alleged bandits following the attempted heist at around 11.15am today at the Bedford Centre in Bedfordview, a town around 12 miles east of central Johannesburg.

Gauteng police had sealed off the crime scene this afternoon to collect evidence following the shootout between a group of armed men  and security guards.

Among the injured were three customers caught in the crossfire and two security guards. Police recovered an AK-47 and an unlicensed handgun at the scene.

The 9mm could be seen in one of a number of dramatic pictures showing the popular shopping centre's bright white floor smeared with a vivid trail of blood, while the ground was also strewn by broken glass caused by stray bullets.

A video tracking the path of blood was posted onto a page called Special Operations Group on Facebook. 

The botched robbery reportedly targeted a bank inside the mall, according to vocativ.com, with the gang approaching security guards who were collecting cash from a bank before a short but intense firefight broke out. 

He added that the guards were both shot in the leg and are in a stable condition.

Netcare 911 spokesperson Santi Steinmann told News24 that the shooting happened at about 11:15, and paramedics received the call at about 11:30.

Those who had been shot are in a serious to critical condition and have been taken to various hospitals, Netcare 911 spokesperson Santi Steinmann. 

Other suspects may be at large, police confirmed.
