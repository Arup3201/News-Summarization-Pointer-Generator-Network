A teenager died after police officers caught him with six grams of crack cocaine and forced him to eat it as punishment in Colombia.

Juan David Osorio Rodas, 19, was walking home from a friend's house when he was stopped and searched by officers in the city of Medellin. 

Finding the drugs in his pockets, they took him to the police station where they forced him to eat it all before letting him go.

Police spokesman Colonel Carlos Alberto Wilches, pictured, left said two officers are being investigated after Juan David Osorio Rodas, right, died after being made to eat six grams of crack cocaine 

A local cafe owner said the young man came in and complained of feeling ill. After drinking some milk, he collapsed on the floor. 

Mr Rodas was taken to hospital where he died shortly after. 

His brother David Garcia said the teenager dealt drugs to earn money, but was about to quit.

The 22-year-old said: 'He did a bit of dealing to earn some money but was about to give that up and find a proper job.'

Cafe owner Fariol Camacho Olivo, 45, said: 'The boy came in and complained of feeling sick after being made to eat the crack.

'He then phoned his brother and told him what had happened.'

He added: 'I didn't really believe him but he did look a bit peaky so I gave him a glass of milk telling him it would reduce the effect of the drug.

'He started drinking it and suddenly collapsed on the floor.'

The 19-year-old was stopped and searched by officers in the city of Medellin who took him to a police station in Bolivar, pictured, when they found the drugs on him

Mr Garcia added: 'We have witnesses who saw the police catch my brother with a few packs of crack.

'They took him to the police headquarters in the Bolivar neighbourhood and made him eat everything he had on him.

'This week we will ask for a medical exam and everything needed to prove what really happened.'

A police spokesman said the two officers involved are being investigated. 

Colonel Carlos Alberto Wilches said: 'I can confirm there are two police officers being investigated.

'In situations like this, when there are possible violations of police procedures, the National Police works alongside all competent institutions to ensure transparency in the investigation.'
