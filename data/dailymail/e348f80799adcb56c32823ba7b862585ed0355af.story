The prank was supposed to highlight societyâ€™s unwillingness to help a person in need. But it proved exactly the opposite when one of the pranksters was punched in the face by a passing bystander.

The stunt, the latest from Jackass-style group Reckless Youth, involves a mock-mugging at an ATM. One member withdraws cash before being approached by another, balaclava-clad member who demands the money. A third member hides and films the fake robbery, and the reaction of bystanders.

It was supposed to bring the Sydney-based group â€“ made up of Daniel Maran,19, and Robert Milazzo and George Proestos, both 16 â€“ online fame and notoriety. But it all went horribly wrong when one bystander, who thought he was witnessing a genuine robbery, punched Proestos in the face.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Three men attempted to stop what they believed was a robbery, only to learn afterwards that it was supposed to be a joke

The attack left the prankster covered in blood and nursing a suspected broken nose.

The group uploaded the entire video, which also features several other fake thefts at Sydney ATMs, to YouTube, commenting that the purpose of the video was to see who would intervene to stop a robbery if they saw it happen right front of them. The group warned fans they got 'mixed results'.

The clip has since gone viral, wracking up more than 450,000 views on YouTube.

In the video's first three 'robberies', things run to plan with bystanders rushing to help Maran, who has been brought to the ground by his friend. The boys then confess the prank and nobody is hurt.

One bystander who comes to help even calls out to other people to call the police before being told it was a joke.

But the boys' luck soon runs out, and the last prank does not go quite as hoped. Three men can be seen trying to help Maran after Proestos pretends to rob him. A third man witnesses the scuffle, runs over and punches Proestos in the face.

At that point one of the boys screams: 'It's a prank, it's a prank,' to stop the men. Proestos then screams in pain, as other passers-by run to the scene.

WARNING GRAPHIC VIDEO CONTENT 

Proestos can be seen running at Maran at the start of the intended stunt. The group said they were shocked at how willing the public was to intervene

Not impressed by the stunt, one of the men who intervened can be heard saying in the video: 'It's not funny', followed by a 'Sorry dude'.

Proestos rises from the ground and his injury is instantly clear as blood pours from his nose. He is then seen nursing his nose as blood continues to pour on the floor.

With a swollen face and gash clearly visible on the left side of his nose, Proestos asks 'Is it healing up? Is it bad, bro?'.

Maran said the punch broke his friend's nose, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. He also said the reaction online to the stunt was not what was expected.

'Every single comment has been negative, saying how stupid we are, how dumb this prank is,' he said.

The bystanders who tried to help were shocked to learn it was a prank, but still helped Proestos recover after he was punched

The reaction from bystanders was also unexpected, with Maran saying he anticipated nobody would be injured in the prank and nor did he expect people to get involved the way they did by trying to stop the 'robbery', thus demonstrating the purpose of the video.

One bystander, 35-year-old Mahendra Singh rushed to help in what he thought was a real robbery. Mr Singh said it was his natural reaction to help and he could not see what was funny about the stunt.

'The first thing I felt was very angry, and I just felt it was a very silly prank. I was worried that this person could have been hurt or I could have been hurt. I was just furious and I just walked off.'

A NSW Police spokeswoman advised people not to take part in any activity that could cause harm to themselves or others.

'Such activities can be highly dangerous and easily misconstrued by members of the public. In some cases, participation may also constitute a criminal offence,' the spokeswoman said.

The backlash hasn't stopped the three boys from creating new videos. Already a new clip of a fake fight has been uploaded to their YouTube channel.

While not everyone may agree with the group's antics, they appear to be working, with more than 2000 subscribers to its YouTube channel and Facebook fan page.
