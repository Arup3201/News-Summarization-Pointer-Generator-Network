One in ten students regrets their choice of university, new research shows.

They are unhappy with undergraduate life and want to swap institutions or courses amid the introduction of £9,000-a-year tuition fees.

The findings will refuel concerns that some students are being pushed onto inappropriate courses by their teachers and parents, leading to unacceptable drop-out rates.

They come as an Ofsted report yesterday warned that too many schools are failing to give pupils decent careers advice and ignoring alternatives to the ‘gold standard’ A-level and university route.

Which? University surveyed 8,053 undergraduates this summer and found that one in four (26 per cent) wished they had done more research into their choice of course and university.

One in ten regretted their choice of university and 11 per cent were sorry they had picked their course.

Students were more likely to be dissatisfied with their choice of course the longer they spent on it - 13 per cent of second to fourth year undergraduates compared to nine per cent of first years.

Jenni Allen, head of Which? University, said: ‘The academic and extra-curricular experience at university varies widely.

‘With increased tuition fees, it’s never been more important for prospective students to weigh up all the options and make sure they make the right choice for them.’

Figures released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency in March showed that one in ten students - 7.4 per cent - drop out of university.

This represents 27,230 students, according to the latest available figures from 2010/11.

An Ofsted report published yesterday found that pupils are given ‘narrow’ information about careers at school and rarely told about courses besides ‘gold standard’ A-levels.

Inspectors said that students need more information as ‘not everyone wants to do A-levels and go to university’.

Vocational training and apprenticeships were ‘rarely promoted effectively’.

The report said: ‘Too many students were unaware of the wide range of occupations and careers that they might consider.’

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, warned students to plan higher education carefully.

He said: ‘The final year at school is very hectic and you can see why sixth formers will be very happy to get on an course they think they want at a university they think they want to go to.

‘The temptation is to not adequately research the university and the course and where it leads.

These habits grew up when going to university was essentially free.

‘But with the introduction of more realistic tuition fees, students will look much more carefully at where they are going and why they are going to make sure that they are making a good investment.’

He added: ‘Students who too hurriedly sign up for something are more likely to drop out and that will waste their time and money.’
