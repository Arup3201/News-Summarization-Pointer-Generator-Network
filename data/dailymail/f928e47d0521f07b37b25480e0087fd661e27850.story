Father accused: Tremaine Rachal has been charged in the death of his toddler son

The father of an 11-month-old boy has been arrested in Texas for the death of his son on Thanksgiving.

Tremaine Rachal, 25, had 30 or 40 people at his Harris County home celebrating Thanksgiving when Kaden Perkins died.

He was rushed to hospital just after 5pm after suffering severe head trauma.

He was pronounced dead upon arrival.

According to KHOU, Rachal, the father of three other children who live at the house on the 2,300 block of Union Mill Rd, was arrested and charged with injury to a child, but that charge may be upgraded to murder.

Rachal told a judge that his son had injured himself after falling off a bed onto the carpeted floor.

The doctor who performed the autopsy on the infant reported that the severe bruising and skull fracture Kaden Perkins suffered could not have been caused by falling off a bed.

Tremaine Rachal and Kaden Perkins' mother do not live together.

The boy was visiting Rachal to spend his first Thanksgiving with his father and his three half-sisters.

The three girls were removed from Rachal's home by Child Protective Services and placed in the care of other family members.

Relatives are being interviewed by police as possible witnesses.

Tremaine Rachal is being held on a $50,000 bond.
