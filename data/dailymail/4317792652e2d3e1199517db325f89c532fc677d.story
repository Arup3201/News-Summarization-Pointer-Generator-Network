Devoted: Michael Pattermore with his terminally ill wife Lynda Bellingham, after it was revealed she has chosen to stop her treatment and die in January

Lynda Bellingham’s husband has spoken of his devastation at the prospect of losing her to cancer.

In a heart-breaking interview, Michael Pattemore said the much-loved actress’s death would ‘create the biggest hole’ in his life.

And he revealed that he had prayed his terminally ill wife would hold on to see one more Christmas before she loses her battle with the disease.

Miss Bellingham, who became a national treasure after starring in the ‘Oxo mum’ gravy adverts, revealed at the weekend that she plans to die within months.

She has decided to stop her chemotherapy in November so she can spend a final Christmas with her family before she ‘lets the natural way do its thing’.

The 66-year-old’s announcement has led to an outpouring of support online. 

More than 6.7million people have viewed a Facebook page set up in her honour by ITV lunchtime chat show Loose Women, on which she was a panellist until 2011.

On yesterday’s show, Miss Bellingham’s former co-host Coleen Nolan read out a text on her behalf. 

It said: ‘Oh my goodness, how embarrassing! That so many people have bothered to show their support.’

Mr Pattemore, 58, said he would find it hard to cope but was happy his wife was ‘at peace’. 

He told Yours Magazine: ‘I am the most positive-thinking guy in the world. Unfortunately it doesn’t matter how positive I am on this one, the good Lord is going to take her. End of. It’s scary and it’s going to create the biggest hole in my life.

‘I just don’t know what the next few weeks will bring or how I’m going to cope. I try not to think about it and what’s going to happen when she’s gone.

‘The only thing giving me comfort is that Lynda is very much at peace with everything; we’ve managed to sort everything out.

‘I just pray to God she gets to see Christmas Day again.’

The mortgage broker, known as Mr Spain on Loose Women due to his Spanish business interests, married Miss Bellingham in 2008. 

He added: ‘The past ten years with Lynda have been the best of my life. Believe it or not, we’ve never even argued, which I think is probably because we share the same sense of humour.

‘She’s so funny when she’s telling her jokes and so genuinely kind, not to mention so talented. And she’s probably one of the most loving mothers I’ve seen.’ 

Miss Bellingham, who has received supportive tweets from celebrities such as Les Dennis and Alan Titchmarsh, thanked her followers on Twitter yesterday. 

‘Hi guys what a roller coaster 24 hours,’ she wrote. ‘I am overwhelmed by your kindness and generosity and good wishes.’

Her former Loose Women co-hosts had hoped to have her phone in live to yesterday’s show, but doctors advised against it.

During the programme, Miss Bellingham emailed the panel, saying: ‘Hi all you gorgeous ladies, speaking to you from my lovely chemo chair, sucking up the drugs! 

'Thank you, thank you so much for the support, you have no idea how much it means to me. But please understand I am in a good place.’

The actress, who has also held TV roles in All Creatures Great And Small and The Sweeney, has bowel cancer and secondary tumours on her liver and lungs. 

She recently told her doctor: ‘I’d love to make one more Christmas, if possible, but I want to stop taking chemo around November in order to pass away by the end of January.’
