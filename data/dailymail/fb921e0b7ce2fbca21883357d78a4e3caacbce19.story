The leaves are still on the trees and much of Britain is bathed in sunshine, yet the Co-op cannot wait for Christmas.

The grocer is stocking ‘Luxury all butter mince pies’ some three months before Santa is expected to slip down the nation’s chimneys.

The pies certainly look very tempting with the ‘Truly Irresistible’ brand packs presenting them as Christmas tree ornaments or fresh out of a gift box.

Co-Op is stocking 'Luxury all butter mince pies' three months before Christmas

However, anyone thinking of stocking up on the festive favourite should beware about hanging on to them for festive parties, for the best before date is October 29.

The early arrival of the mince pies provides yet further evidence of how retailers, particularly the big supermarkets, see special holidays like Christmas and Easter as key to their entire annual sales performance.

The run up to Christmas and New Year accounts for more than 40per cent of annual sales and profits at the major grocers, so they are keen to extend the buying period for as long as possible.

Shopper Sandra Thompson said she was 'shocked' to come across mince pies for sale, saying she would be 'sick of the sight of them' by Christmas

Shopper Sandra Thompson was looking for sun tan lotion - as she is about to go on a summer holiday to Spain - when she saw the mince pies on sale at a Co-op in Battersea.

She said: ‘I was shocked to come across these mince pieces so early in the year. It’s still summertime for goodness sake. Christmas is months away.

‘I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw boxes of mince pies piled up in the shop. I’ll be sick of the sight of them by Christmas. And the irony is this lot won’t even last until Christmas.

The Co-op said it has been putting two brands of mince pies in stores since early September, the ‘Loved by Us’ brand, priced at £1 per box, while the more upmarket ‘Truly Irresistible’ brand are £2 per box.

A spokesman said this was part of a wider trend common across supermarkets to 'introduce a small number of popular Christmas lines at this time’.

The spokesman added: ‘Our customers love them and whilst it may seem early to think about Christmas, especially with the unusually warm weather at the moment, we have seen a high demand for the mince pies. Indeed, sales are over 60 per cent up on the same time last year.’

Despite the good sales, the chain says it currently has no plans to stock them all year around.
