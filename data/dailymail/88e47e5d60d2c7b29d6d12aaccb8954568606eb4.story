A computer student suspected of trying to hack into police websites has been jailed for refusing to hand over his password in the interests of national security.

University student Christopher Wilson caused the Northumbria Police website to shut down after ringing the force using a voice changing device to warn of a cyber attack.

Wilson, who has Asperger's Syndrome, was caught sending online messages about 'trolling the Newcastle police department' and infiltrating the secret files of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

Christopher Wilson, 22, has been jailed for six months for refusing to hand over his computer passwords after earlier being suspected of trying to hack into police websites

The 22-year-old even suggested putting nasty messages on a condolence page set up for two female police officers shot dead in Manchester.

Wilson, who is doing a Master's degree in computers and has set up his own business programming artificial intelligence systems, was studying at Northumbria University when he first came to the attention of police.

After repeatedly refusing to provide his password for his encrypted computer, a judge last year ordered him to do so in the interests of national security.

None of the 50 passwords he provided worked so he has now been jailed for six months for failing to provide his details.

Judge Simon Hickey told him: 'What you were doing was for your own satisfaction, showing what you could do with your undoubted skill with computers.

'But this is a serious offence and I can't avoid an immediate custodial sentence.'

Police began investigating Wilson in October, 2012 after two emails were sent to the Vice Chancellor of Newcastle University saying a man had been making online threats to kill a member of his staff and that he had a handgun and ammunition.

The message was sent under the username 'Catch 22', which was linked to Wilson's server.

Police went to Wilson's home in Milford Close, Washington, and seized computer equipment, including one system he had built himself which allowed remote access to other computers.

Wilson denied making the university threats and claimed he had fallen out with a couple of Dutch men online and that the allegations were malicious. Prosecutors accepted he was telling the truth and he wasn't charged.

Police still wanted to access his computer and the passwords he initially provided didn't work.

Detectives later linked Wilson to a call made to them a month later warning that the Northumbria Police website was going to be attacked.

The attack lasted for eight minutes and the website began to slow down before being taken down as a precaution for four minutes.

Wilson was arrested in January last year and admitted making the call but claimed he was just warning them of a possible attack by someone else.

Police then uncovered other messages he had sent from his Skype phone which included him saying, 'gonna (sic) go harass some police stations' and 'Let's troll Newcastle police department'.

He also encouraged others to report a hoax mugging outside Newcastle's Centre for Life.

Wilson also discussed hacking into the university network and getting passwords for 50 other students, the court heard.

When his phone was examined, police found references to him carrying out another online attack on the Serious Organised Crime Agency and trolling a police memorial page.

David Lister, defending, said: 'He has expressed genuine remorse, he bitterly regrets his actions.

'He was 19 at the time and the impact of his Autism Spectrum Disorder or Asperger's meant he matured more slowly than others.'
