A group calling itself the IRA has claimed responsibility for suspect packages sent to armed forces recruitment centres last week.

In a statement the 'IRA' has said it was behind the parcels, and chillingly that 'attacks will continue when and where the IRA see fit'.

Scotland Yard said a group using a recognised codeword had contacted a media outlet in Northern Ireland on Saturday.

Four suspected explosive devices were discovered at Army careers offices in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury and the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough last Thursday.

Alert: A group calling itself the IRA has claimed responsibility for suspect packages sent to armed forces recruitment centres last week, including Brighton

Location: Seven suspect packages were sent to armed forces careers offices last week

This
 followed packets sent to Aldershot, Hampshire, on Wednesday and another
 two on Tuesday to an armed forces careers office in Reading, Berkshire,
 and the Army and RAF careers office in Chatham, Kent.

One
 of the packages bore a Republic of Ireland postmark and Downing Street 
said the small but potentially viable devices bore 'the hallmarks of 
Northern Ireland-related terrorism'.

Scotland
 Yard said: 'We are aware of the claim of responsibility for the devices
 that were sent to Army recruitment centres in England last week.

'The
 claim was received on Saturday February 15 by a Northern Irish media 
outlet using a recognised codeword. The claim was allegedly made on 
behalf of the "IRA".

'The public is urged to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the Anti-Terrorist Hotline, 0800 789 321.'

The Irish News reported that the 'IRA' 
had given a statement which said: 'The IRA claims responsibility for the
 explosive devices that were sent to British armed forces recruitment 
centres in England. Attacks will continue when and where the IRA see 
fit.'

Scare: An Army recruitment centre was also sealed off by police in Chatham, Kent

The
 IRA disbanded in the years after it declared an end to its armed 
campaign in 2005, but a group calling itself the New IRA formed just 
before the London Olympics in 2012 and was linked to letter bombs sent 
last autumn.

A 'suspicious package' was
 discovered today at naval base HMS Collingwood in Portsmouth, although 
on closer inspection the parcel was deemed to be 'not suspicious'.

The
 MoD was unable to confirm if security levels at military bases had been
 increased since suspicious packages were sent to recruiting centres 
last week.

However, the Home
 Office's current terror threat level for Great Britain remains at 
'substantial' for international terrorism, meaning an attack is a strong
 possiblity, and 'moderate' from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, 
meaning an attack is possible, but not likely.

Following the discovery of the packages, Prime Minister David 
Cameron chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergencies 
committee to discuss the suspicious parcels.

Worry: A suspect device was also found at the Army Careers office in Canterbury, Kent

A Number 10 spokeswoman said: 
'Seven suspect packages have been identified as containing small, crude,
 but potentially viable devices bearing the hallmarks of Northern 
Ireland-related terrorism.

'These have now been safely dealt with by the police and bomb disposal units.

'Guidance
 has been issued to staff at all military establishments and Royal Mail 
asking them to be extra vigilant and to look out for any suspect 
packages and the screening procedures for mail to armed forces careers 
offices is being reviewed.

'The national threat level remains under constant review.'

At the weekend security sources said that the A4-sized packages were the work of ‘amateur’ Republican 
terrorists seeking to impress more established rivals, security sources 
believe.

Scotland Yard 
anti-terror detectives have been working with police officers from both sides 
of the Irish border to identify those responsible.

Patrick Mercer MP, a former Army 
colonel who commanded UK troops in Northern Ireland, said that an 
examination of the devices by forensic experts suggested the bombmakers 
lacked experience.

He said: ‘I understand that 
they were amateurish in their construction. The devices are thought to 
have been sent by members of the Real IRA, however there is currently a 
feud inside this organisation about whether to mount a campaign in 
mainland Britain.’

British Army recruiting centres have open since the parcels were sent, but remain on high alert.

Police have
 said two of the packages were posted in Dublin and a third package has 
been traced to an area close to the border with Northern Ireland. No 
arrests have been made.

Bomb: The Grand Hotel in Brighton was targeted during the Conservative Party conference in 1984, killing five people including MP Sir Anthony Berry

The
 Irish Republican Army (IRA) can trace its roots back to Catholic Irish 
nationalists in the early 1900s, forming after the 1916 Easter Rising as
 an amalgamation of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish 
Citizen Army.

During the Irish war of independence fought against the British between 1919 and 1921, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign fighting for the withdrawal of Britain from Ireland.

When the war ended with a treaty a split occurred, with the anti-Treaty IRA and pro-treaty Free State Army fighting each other in the country's civil war.

After a ceasefire was called the IRA continued to maintain that the governments of the Irish Free States were illegitimate. 

In
 August 1969, there were fierce riots in Northern Ireland, including a three-day confrontation between Catholic residents of the Bogside and police in Derry known as the Battle of the Bogside.

In December 1969, the IRA split into the Official IRA, which followed a more Marxist
 ideology, and the more radical Provisional IRA over issues including 
the use of arms to defend Catholic communities in Belfast during the riots.

Political party Sinn Fein, which was formed in 1905, took on its current form in 1970 after a split again due to the drift towards Marxist ideas and the failure of the leadership to defend nationalists in Belfast.

Although the party is associated with the IRA it has strongly denied that senior members held posts on the IRA Army Council.

While the 
Official IRA called a ceasefire in 1972 and fizzled out, the Provisional
 IRA embarked on a 30 year paramilitary campaign against the British 
presence in Northern Ireland.

In the late 1970s the group re-organised itself into smaller cell-based structures that would be harder to penetrate. It is estimated that there were just several hundred members, organised into small cells.

Dissident republicans targeted England on several occasions.

In 1972 a bomb was detonated in Aldershot, at the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment, killing seven people and the following year two bombs were set off by IRA members in 
London, including one outside the Old Bailey, which killed one man and 
injured 180 others. 

In 1974, 21 people were killed in a 
Birmingham pub bombing, while another 11 died after an IRA bomb was 
planted on a coach carrying servicemen and their families along the M62.

Ten years later, the Conservative Party conference in Brighton was targeted, killing five people including MP Sir Anthony Berry. The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing.

In
 1996, the IRA set off a large bomb at London’s Canary Wharf offices, 
killing two people and causing millions of pounds of damage.

Devastation: 206 people were injured after a 1,500kg bomb was detonated in the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester in 1996

In
 the same year  206 people were injured after a 1,500kg bomb was 
detonated in the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester, and an explosive
 device detonated prematurely on a bus travelling along Aldwych in 
central London, killing the IRA operative and injuring eight others.

On
 31 August 1994, the IRA called a unilateral ceasefire with the aim of 
having Sinn Féin, admitted into the 
Northern Ireland peace process.

This
 ceasefire ended in February 1996 but another was declared in July 1997.
 The IRA accepted the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 as a 
negotiated end to the Northern Ireland conflict.

In
 2005 the organisation declared a formal end to its campaign and had its
 weaponry decommissioned under international supervision.

Other dissident
 groups have emerged since, including the Real IRA which formed in 1997 
and was behind the August 1998 Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people. On
 March 7, 2009 Real IRA members claimed responsibility for an attack on Massereene Barracks that killed two British soldiers.

A group the 'New IRA' formed in 2012 from remnants of the Real IRA and other paramilitary factions including Republican Action Against Drugs.

As the Real IRA did this group continues to refer to itself as 'the Irish Republican Army'.
