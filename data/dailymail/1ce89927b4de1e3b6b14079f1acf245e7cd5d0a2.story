Happy New Year from St Barths! The beautiful little island paradise in the French West Indies is just 50 minutes by propeller plane from Antigua (but more of that later).

You'll have to forgive the late blog entry this week as high levels of partying and industrial strength hangovers have taken their toll.

NYE was a big one that lasted well into Jan 1 - a beach party with the world's biggest DJ David Guetta.

The flight into St Barths is not for the faint-hearted and so the luxury of private jet does help, says Spencer

My good friend Max and I had VIP tickets to the Nikki Beach party, which was mind-blowing. Right from the start we knew it was going to be one of those memorable nights that we'll talk about for years to come.

We started with a few Chili-Chili Bang Bang cocktails (jalapeno-infused tequila gives this drink a bit of a kick) at the On The Rocks bar at my parent's hotel the Eden Rock, before moving over to Nikki beach by about 11pm so that we could have a good spot when midnight came in.

Nikki beach is next door to our hotel on St Jean's Bay so it's literally two minutes walk away across the sand.

The party was heaving with the great and the good, and it was a very beautiful crowd. We had a table right next to the DJ – you can see how close we were from the picture. And if you felt like a bit of time out, you could just walk down to the sea and have a paddle.

It was an amazing night that went on to a friend's poolside party at the villa up in the hills just above.

The next day was spent recovering at the Sand Bar at the Eden Rock hotel. You can see the pictures we took – they're not the best shots ever but it was the best we could do in our state of health.

I flew out to St Barth's just after Christmas with my family up at our house in Scotland, and I was lucky to get a lift on a friend's private plane on the last leg of the journey. 

Doing the flight in on a propeller plane 
can be a bit of a white-knuckle ride for some as incoming flights drop 
steeply over the top of a mountain and onto the runway. It's not for the faint-hearted, so the luxury of private jet does help to calm the nerves.

I've done it so many times now that it doesn't bother me, but it can seriously freak out nervous flyers.

It's a lot easier on the return journey as you take off straight over the sea, the only problem with the away leg is that you are leaving this amazing place.

The worst part of the return flight, Spencer says, is that you're leaving this incredible place

And now, sadly, it's time to pack and go back to work in storm swept Britain… but that said, I'm looking forward to new challenges in 2014.

1. Not to go back to yo-yo dieting. I've been a good boy so far and I'm still in good shape. I've kept up my fitness and thanks to the odd Forza T5 Super Strength pill here and there I've kept the snacking at bay. I want to look my best for the next series of Made In Chelsea. We start filming in a couple of weeks and it will be great to hook up with everyone again after a long break. 

2. To stay young, free and single. OK, this one might be harder to keep but so far, one week in and I'm doing fine.

See you all soon, Spencer xxx
