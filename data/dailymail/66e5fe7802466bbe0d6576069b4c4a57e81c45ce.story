The leader of the Green Party has claimed she was misquoted in an article in which she reportedly said being poor in India was not as bad as being on benefits in Britain.

Natalie Bennett said she was misquoted in an Economist interview in which she claims she was trying to make a point about the difference between 'absolute and relative poverty'.

The article quoted her as saying that being poor in India was not as bad 'because at least everyone else there is poor too'.

The original Economist article said: 'They (the Greens) are broadly against consumption, for example: 'The world is sodden with stuff, it cannot have more stuff,' said Ms Bennett.

'Yet they do not appear to have considered what that would mean for billions of the world's poorest people, almost none of whom live in Britain.

'When Bagehot (the interviewer) suggested to her that there was a problem with this, Ms Bennett said he was worrying too much: to be poor in India wasn't so bad as to be on benefits in Britain, she suggested, 'because at least everyone else there is poor too'.'

Ms Bennett said  the partial quote did not reflect her recollection of the conversation, and insists she was misquoted.

Ms Bennett spoke after the article was seized on by critics on Twitter, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage denouncing her apparent comments

The Green Party leader said: 'As someone who has worked on women's healthcare projects in India I'm very aware of the issue of poverty in India.

'It doesn't reflect anything like my recollection of the conversation.

'What we were talking about was the issue of absolute poverty and relative poverty.

'Relative poverty has a real impact on people's lives, for example if you don't have the clothes to go to a job interview.

'It was a discussion about whether there is absolute poverty and relative poverty in the UK.'

She added: 'I don't believe that I said those words.'

Ms Bennett spoke after the article was seized on by critics on Twitter, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeting about her reported comments.

Mr Farage tweeted a link to a separate website carrying the relevant passage from the Economist, adding: 'What utter drivel, highlighting a major lack of critical thinking and compassion'.
