A community is in shock after an estranged husband shot dead his wife at their daughter’s 16th birthday party over the weekend.

Kelly Suckla, 43, apparently had an argument with his wife Kristi Suckla, 44, at the celebration, which was held at her parents’ house on Saturday night.

Mrs Suckla was shot multiple times in her neck and body; police later found the husband lying dead on a walkway in front of the Grapevine, Texas, home; a handgun was found nearby.

Celebration gone wrong: Police said the separated couple was celebrating their daughter Rachel's birthday at her grandparents' home in Grapevine, Texas

According to the Star-Telegram, Mrs Suckla had separated from Suckla and had been living with her parents for around two months.

The estranged couple had reunited for their daughter’s birthday. Police said that the couple, though separated, seemed friendly enough.

But around 10pm Saturday night, the couple got in an argument. Grapevine police said that Kelly Suckla shot his wife several times in the neck and torso.

He then shot himself in the head a few moments later in her parents’ front lawn.

Kelly was pronounced dead at the scene; his wife Kristi was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Witness: Rachel Suckla, 16, was having a dinner at her grandparents' house; though she did not witness the shooting, she and her brother saw her parents afterward

Police said that the couple’s 16-year-old daughter and 21-year-old son were in the house at the time of the shooting but did not witness it.

Though the investigation is on-going, authorities have called this a murder-suicide.

A Grapevine police spokesperson told MailOnline that the teenager and their 21-year-old son came out after hearing gunshots.

‘At that point, the witnesses that were inside the house heard some gunfire. When they went out, the witnesses saw the bodies lying there,’ he said.

The crime has rocked the quiet, upscale town of Grapevine, with many of its residents in disbelief.

Kelly Suckla’s neighbor, Jeff Barr, told WFAA that there was no indication that Suckla was angry or that he was going to commit such a heinous act.

‘They seemed normal – never thought anything was going wrong,’ the shocked neighbor said.

The station notes that this is the latest in a string of extreme domestic violence cases against women.

Last week, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings spoke out in a news conference demanding police officers to ‘redouble those efforts’ against abusive partners.

‘This is not going to be at the bottom of the heap,’ he said. ‘We’re going to take it right to the top.’

According to WFAA, domestic violence-related murder rates more than doubled in Dallas in the past year.
