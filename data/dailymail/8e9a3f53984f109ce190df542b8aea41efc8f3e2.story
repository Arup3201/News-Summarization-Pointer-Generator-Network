A murder trial is set to start on Wednesday for a New Jersey man charged with tossing his 2-year-old daughter into a creek while she was still strapped in her car seat.

Arthur Morgan III of Eatontown is accused of weighing down the seat with a tire-changing jack so that it would sink.

He's charged with killing his daughter, Tierra Morgan-Glover, in November 2011.

'Murdered': Tierra Morgan-Glover (left) was 
allegedly killed by Morgan (right) while the 27-year-old was on a 
court-approved visit with her. They had been due to watch the animated 
film Happy Feet Two together

Indicted: Morgan's trial begins on Wednesday. Here he is shown during a previous court appearance

Her body was found in a creek inside a Jersey Shore park after he failed to return the girl to her mother following a trip to see a movie about dancing penguins.

An autopsy determined that the child was alive when she hit the water.

Morgan fled to California following the child's death. He was found by a fugitive recovery task force.

Prosecutors say Morgan had asked the girl's mother if he could take Tierra to see the movie Happy Feet Two.

When he did not return her after a few hours, the mother called police.

A warrant charging Morgan with child endangerment was issued before the girl's body was found.

But
 an abduction alert for Tierra was not issued because the state had no 
reason to believe the child was in danger until she was found dead.

According
 to prosecutors, Morgan tossed the car seat, with his daughter strapped 
snugly inside its protective belts, from an overpass into the chilly 
water of the creek.

The 
creek, about 20 miles north of where she lived, is up to 7ft deep in the
 area where the body was found, near an overpass 15ft above the creek.

Caught: Arthur Morgan III, with his arms handcuffed behind his back, lies on the ground surrounded by U.S. Marshals following his dramatic arrest in San Diego

Floored: Tierra's death sparked a week-long manhunt for her father across the U.S.

To
 ensure that her car seat sank, he had attached a car jack, the heavy 
metal contraption used to raise a car's chassis to change a flat tire.

Her cause of death was listed as 'homicidal violence, including submersion in water'.

An autopsy determined that the child was alive when she hit the water.

Should
 Morgan be convicted, prosecutors say they will seek to have him 
imprisoned for the rest of his life without parole â€“ the harshest 
punishment available in New Jersey since state officials instituted a 
moratorium on new death penalty cases several years ago.
