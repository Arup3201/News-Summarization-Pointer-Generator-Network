Richard Scudamore is unlikely to face calls for his resignation from within football after the leaking of private emails left the Premier League chief executive facing accusations of sexism.

Scudamore has been forced to issue a public apology after a former personal assistant went to a Sunday newspaper with emails, intended only for close friends, that contained a number of crass, puerile sexist jokes.

There was also a steady flow of criticism on Sunday, with Dame Tessa Jowell among those to condemn one of the most powerful men in the game.

Pensive: Scudamore looks to have things on his mind as he takes his seat at the Etihad

But the FA declined 
the opportunity to join the chorus of disapproval - despite the Premier 
League’s opposition to Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposal for B 
teams - and other senior figures in the game have chosen to back him.

Karren
 Brady, the West Ham vice-chairman and one of the most prominent women 
in football, contacted Scudamore on Saturday night to offer her support,
 assuring him that in 20 years she has never considered the 54-year-old 
to be sexist.

Aware on 
Friday that the story was going to be published, Premier League 
officials contacted their stakeholders on Saturday to warn them of the 
potential storm.

Scudamore was due to appear on Sportsweek on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday morning but withdrew for ‘legal reasons’.

Even so, Scudamore - at the Etihad on Sunday for Manchester City’s encounter with West Ham - had to face a barrage of criticism.

Jowell accused Scudamore of 
undermining support for women’s football. ‘His championing of women’s 
football, and women’s football coming of age, is undermined by this,’ 
she told Sportsweek.

The former culture secretary and Olympics minister added that the comments were ‘incredibly disappointing’ and 
‘unacceptable’, saying: ‘You can’t have one position publicly and then be 
laughing privately.'

Jowell continued: ‘In the world of
 social media and email, there is no public and private.

‘I
 think what Richard needs to reflect on, and I think he’s a decent man, 
is the disconnect between what he thinks privately and what he has tried
 to achieve publicly.

‘I 
hope his public commitment to women’s sport will prevail and he will be 
mortified by this, as indeed he should be.’

In his statement, 
Scudamore said the comments were made in ‘private emails exchanged 
between colleagues and friends of many years’.

‘They
 were received from and sent to my private and confidential email 
address, which a temporary employee who was with the organisation for 
only a matter of weeks, should not have accessed and was under no 
instruction to do so,’ he said.

‘Nonetheless
 I accept the contents are inappropriate and apologise for any offence 
caused, particularly to this person.’

Mark Palios, former chief 
executive of the FA, said: ‘The important thing is Richard has 
apologised and recognised it was unfortunate. I don’t think it changes 
the good work he does on a day-to-day basis.’

In
 his emails Scudamore encouraged a 
lawyer who reportedly does legal work for the Premier League to keep a 
woman colleague they nicknamed Edna ‘off your shaft’.

And
 in another email Scudamore said: ‘I had a girlfriend once called double
 decker... happy for you to play upstairs, but her Dad got angry if you 
went below.’
