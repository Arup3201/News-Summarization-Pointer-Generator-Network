Amelie Mauresmo will leave thoughts of the future until after Andy Murray completes the defence of his Wimbledon title.

Murray has not dropped a set on his way to the quarter-finals, where he is likely to face his stiffest test against 11th seed Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday.

The defending champion's excellence means Mauresmo's first experience of being Murray's coach at a grand slam has been largely stress-free.

Murray and Mauresmo's partnership is initially just for the grass-court season, although the idea from the start was for it to develop into something long term provided both are happy with how things go.

The pair have not had any discussions about the future yet, with Mauresmo saying: 'I think we are both focusing on what's going on here and we'll see for that later.'

Mauresmo was thrust into the limelight immediately when Murray announced her as his new coach after losing in the semi-finals of the French Open.

They have had to do their bonding largely in front of the cameras but both have seemed happy and relaxed on the practice courts and Mauresmo is delighted with how things are going.

'Things are smooth,' she said. 'Everyone has really made me welcome in the team and I've got to know them all much better now. Things are smoother and smoother, I would say.'

Dimitrov has been hyped since he was a junior and that only increased when his then coach Peter Lundgren rated him as better than Roger Federer at 18.

The nickname of Baby Fed has proved hard to shake off but Dimitrov is starting to become a force in his own right.

Since linking up with tough Australian coach Roger Rasheed last October, the 23-year-old has won titles on all surfaces and reached his first grand slam quarter-final at the Australian Open.

He is now through to that stage for a second time and is on an eight-match winning streak after succeeding Murray as Queen's Club champion two weeks ago.

Murray, who came close to hiring Rasheed as his coach in 2011 before plumping for Ivan Lendl, said: 'He's a more mature player now, I think.

'He makes better decisions on the court than he used to. Watching him play, his strokes and stuff, technically he hasn't made many changes to his game.

'But he's playing higher-percentage tennis, making better decisions. That adds up to winning many more matches.

'He can obviously hit a lot of different shots. He has a lot of variety in his game. Sometimes it takes time to know how to use that properly. He's starting to do that now.

'He's starting to come into his prime. He's won a lot of matches this year. He's a tough player. It will be a hard match for me.'
