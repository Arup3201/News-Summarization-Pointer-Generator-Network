Clarke Carlisle's wife has spoken of her trauma when she saw the former footballer and the injuries he sustained after jumping in front of a lorry. 

Gemma said that she wasn't prepared to see her husband in such a state, and that she begged him not to die. 

She told The Sun: 'Nothing could prepare me for what I saw. There was so much blood. It was everywhere. His face was twice the size. His eyes were bulging out and they were filled with blood.'

Carlisle admitted in an interview with The Sun that he tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry

Carlisle revealed that his collision with a lorry in December was a suicide attempt as he battled depression.

'He had a big shard of glass sticking out his left eye, Gemma said. 'The smell was horrific. He was barely conscious. I don’t think he wanted to be there. He didn’t want to look at me or talk to me.

'I went to hold his hand but his hands and his arms had bits hanging off. I remember saying to him "don’t you dare die, please get better, please live".

Carlisle was recently released from hospital six weeks after he was injured in a collision with a lorry

The 35-year-old former footballer played for QPR (left) and Burnley (right) during his playing days 

'When I asked if he’d done this to himself he just stared straight back at me and said "Yes".'

Sportsmail revealed that Carlisle had been critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York.

The married father of two had to be airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, with North Yorkshire Police confirming that an investigation was under way after a collision that ‘involved a male pedestrian and a lorry’.

Carlisle finally returned home from hospital last Friday.
