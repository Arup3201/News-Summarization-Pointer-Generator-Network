David Cameron and George Osborne are facing questions about their roles in the controversial BSkyB bid after James Murdoch claimed he had discussed it with both men.

Mr Murdoch said he raised the subject with the Prime Minister during a cosy Christmas dinner at the Cotswolds home of former News International boss Rebekah Brooks.

Downing Street spent months dodging questions about that occasion, which took place on December 23, 2010, two days after Business Secretary Vince Cable had been stripped of responsibility for the bid and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt had taken charge.

Cosy relationship: David Cameron and former News International boss Rebekah Brooks together. James Murdoch discussed the BSkyB takeover with the Prime Minister at her dinner

Initially, Number Ten refused to provide a date or even suggest whether the dinner took place – and when it did, sources were quoted as saying neither Rupert Murdoch’s takeover bid for BSkyB nor the phone hacking scandal were discussed.

Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, a guest at the dinner as another member of the so-called ‘Chipping Norton set’, insisted: ‘BSkyB was not mentioned. Nor was phone hacking.’

The Prime Minister himself later told Parliament he ‘never had one inappropriate conversation’ with Mr Murdoch and ‘completely took myself out of any decision making about this bid’.

But appearing at the Leveson inquiry yesterday, Mr Murdoch, 41, revealed he had used the Christmas get-together to seek assurances from the PM about News International’s plans to buy BSkyB.

He said he wanted to know that Jeremy Hunt, the new minister overseeing the bid, would be more ‘objective’ than his ‘acutely biased’ predecessor Mr Cable.

Mr Murdoch said he and Mr Cameron discussed the revelation that Mr Cable had been caught privately ‘declaring war’ on the Murdoch empire, a disclosure which meant Mr Hunt being handed responsibility for the bid.

Little chat: Mr Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that he
 had a 'tiny, side conversation' with the Prime Minister about the takeover of BskyB ahead of a 
dinner for up to 15 people at the Chipping Norton home of Mrs Brooks

‘He reiterated what he had said 
publicly, which is that the behaviour had been unacceptable, and I 
imagine I expressed the hope that things would be dealt with in a way 
that was appropriate and judicial,’ Mr Murdoch said.

‘It was a tiny conversation ahead of a dinner where all these people were there, so it wasn’t really a discussion.’

Mr Cameron was accused last year of 
breaking Parliament’s ministerial code of conduct, which requires 
ministers to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest, by 
attending the Christmas dinner, a claim which was dismissed.

But for the Prime Minister, the 
revelations about the Christmas dinner mark an unwelcome return to the 
subject of his closeness to Mrs Brooks, the former chief executive of 
News International.

It also has uncomfortable echoes of 
last month’s ‘horsegate’ saga, in which Mr Cameron was reluctant to 
admit riding a retired police horse that Mrs Brooks had been loaned by 
the Metropolitan Police.

He was eventually forced to confess he
 may have ridden the horse with Mrs Brooks’s racehorse owner husband 
Charlie, a friend from their Eton days.

Scrutiny of Mr Cameron’s friendships 
with News International executives is likely to be heightened by another
 disclosure by Mr Murdoch yesterday – that he personally informed him 
The Sun would be backing the Conservatives at the next election.

Over drinks at The George Club in 
London on September 10, 2009, Mr Murdoch said ‘it was made clear to Mr 
Cameron by me’ that The Sun would be switching allegiance from Labour.

The media baron denied this was part of a deal to trade favours with Mr Cameron.

His wife, Kathryn Murdoch, who was 
sitting in the public gallery along with Mr Murdoch’s brother Lachlan, 
was overheard saying ‘outrageous’ when this suggestion was put to her 
husband.

The inquiry heard how James Murdoch had met Mr Cameron a total of 14 times, 12 of them before he became Prime Minister.

There were seven breakfasts, lunches 
and dinners between June 2006 and May 2009 for what Mr Murdoch said were
 the purposes of ‘general social conversation’, often with their wives 
present.

Mr Cameron dined at Mr Murdoch’s 
London home in September 2009, nine days before The Sun switched 
allegiance to the Tories, and on November 2 that year, James Murdoch and
 Rebekah Brooks joined Mr Cameron for breakfast, to discuss ‘politics’.

The two men have met only twice since 
Mr Cameron became PM, once at the Christmas dinner and a lunch at 
Chequers in November 2010. Mr Murdoch said he was ‘curious’ as to 
Cameron’s views ‘on a variety of topics’ when he met him.

It also emerged that Tony and Cherie 
Blair invited James Murdoch to Chequers for lunch when Labour were in 
power, and he met Gordon Brown three times – all three at the request of
 Mr Brown.

Mr Murdoch told the inquiry yesterday 
he was also ‘friendly’ with Mr Osborne and had visited the Chancellor’s 
grace and favour house, Dorneywood in Buckinghamshire, with his family.

David Cameron and News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie are at the heart of what has become known as the ‘Chipping Norton Set’.

It is made up of powerful political and media figures who have homes in a tiny triangle in one of the most scenic parts of England – the Cotswolds.

The group go to the same house parties, dine together and even ride together.

Key players in the 'set' also include Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson and daughter of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, Elisabeth who is married to PR fixer Matthew Freud.

They met socially until the phone hacking scandal erupted.

He claimed he had a discussion with 
the Chancellor about News Corp’s bid to take over BSkyB, which was 
eventually dropped last July after a public outcry over the revelation 
that the News of the World hacked murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s 
phone.

Mr Murdoch said his conversation about
 the proposed buy-out of the satellite broadcaster with the Chancellor 
‘would have just been to be grumpy about it taking a long time and being
 referred to (regulator) Ofcom, which I was very clear in public about 
at the same time’.

Last night Labour MP John Mann raised 
questions about the response from the then Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus 
O’Donnell – now Lord O’Donnell – to his questions last year about 
conversations between the Prime Minister and Mr Murdoch regarding the 
BSkyB bid.

Last July, the MP was told that decisions ‘were at all times taken properly and in accordance with the relevant legislation’.

Lord O’Donnell concluded: ‘The Prime 
Minister was not the decision maker. Nor did he seek to influence the 
decisions of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy
 Hunt.

‘The fact that he had meetings with Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch last year is a matter of public record.

‘The fact that the Prime Minister was 
not the decision maker meant that he would not have had to consult me 
before meeting them.’

But Mr Mann said: ‘The ex-Cabinet Secretary and Prime Minister both face critical questions that must be adequately answered.

‘Why was there no investigation 
carried out last year into the Prime Minister’s dealings with James 
Murdoch regarding the BSkyB bid?’

A Downing Street spokesman denied that
 journalists had been misled last year, insisting it had been right to 
say Mr Cameron had not been involved in formal discussions about BSkyB.
