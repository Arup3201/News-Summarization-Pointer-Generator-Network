An intimate snap of Tibetan women relaxing in a natural hot spring with their children during the annual Bathing Festival was just one of the entries which captured the judge's attention at this year's  International Print Exhibition.

The Royal Photographic Society received over 3,000 prints from nearly 800 photographers in the competition.

Submitted by Yao
Wei, and titled The Bathing Festival, the description with the entry which won Bronze read: 'The hot spring in
Tibet contains various minerals and is believed to be therapeutic. 

'It
is pure enjoyment to take a bath with the whole family in these 
wonderful natural hot pools; a feeling of being in Paradise!'

The Bathing Festival by Yao Wei won Bronze. The entry description read: 'The hot spring in Tibet contains various minerals and is believed to be therapeutic. 'It is pure enjoyment to take a bath with the whole family in these wonderful natural hot pools; a feeling of being in Paradise!'

Prize winning: Gordon Bramham won Bronze for Rain Raven, left.  The image was taken from a hide at Aloos in the French Pyrenees,' he said. Silver was claimed by Amanda-Jane Bollini for her photo Poppy & Honey at Pett Level, Winchelsea Beach. She said 'I viewed the scene, waited for the right moment, silently planning when I should press the shutter'

This exhibition  by The Royal Photographic Society and Allen & Overy LLP, showcases a wide 
variety of established, emerging and amateur photography taken by some 
of the world's most talented photographers.

Gold Award was given to Gaby Wood for her entry Dead Deer. She said: This photo was taken last summer in Princeton, New Jersey, the day before Hurricane Irene hit the East Coast. I went for a run early one morning and found this beautiful young stag, very recently dead.

'When I went back to get my camera I also hauled my children out of their game of dressing up – which is how my eldest ended up here: a little scared, a little devastated, wearing a tutu and not too close.'

Entrants competed for a share of the 
£6,500 total prize fund and Gold, Silver, Bronze medals as well as the 
special Allen & Overy award, which this year has the theme of 
Change.

Matthew Town, won Gold for his photo titled Fencer.  He said 'The portrait ‘Fencer’ was part of a series I shot at a Fencing Club in Bournemouth, Dorset.

'I had been looking into how class affects sport, and after doing some research I found that fencing was generally perceived as an elitist sport.

'Whether it is an elitist sport or not does not matter to me, what I am interested in is how people portray themselves within various sports.

Silver was claimed by Amanda-Jane Bollini for her photo Poppy & Honey at Pett Level, Winchelsea Beach.

With her entry she wrote: Pett Level, Winchelsea beach is an image which encompasses simplicity. 

'My
identical twin daughters Honey & Poppy had been playing on the 
almost empty beach for some while, watching the tide retreat.  It was 
early evening, with a perfect blue sky.  Quietly in the distance we 
heard the sound of the light aircraft and awaited its approach.

'I viewed the scene, waited for the right moment, silently planning 
when I should press the shutter.  The result was a wonderful memory of 
the British coastline.'

Daniel Lilley on Silver for  Snorkeler and said 'This photograph is of a man snorkeling off the coast of the isle of Portland, Dorset.

'Named ‘Vindelis’ by the Romans the isle nowadays is a place of mystery.

'The
image is part of a larger documentary project about the area, looking 
at the inhabitants and the relationships they hold to their 
surroundings.

'Watching the Band' by Chrissie Westgate. 'I had been asked to take some official photos for a band called The Scary Bitches' she said. The decisive moment here, was when the air guitar appeared; the faces and actions say it all!'

Watching the Band by Chrissie
Westgate won Bronze. She said: 'Another of those Cartier Bresson 
decisive moments! I had been asked to take some official photos for a 
band called ‘The Scary Bitches’  and had travelled with them to a gig. 

'The
bands were rehearsing and being sound checked when people started to 
arrive. The decisive moment here, was when the air guitar appeared; the 
faces and actions say it all!

Gordon Bramham won Bronze for Rain Raven.

The image was taken from a hide at Aloos in the French Pyrenees,' he said

'The
hide was in a position that could offer sightings of Lammergeier and 
Golden Eagle, but it was far too small. I could not move and I had seen 
nothing but rain all day. The Raven landed and I pressed the shutter - 
it looked almost as fed up as me, but it made my day!'

Bill Cooper's entry Urban Renewal won the A&O award (£1000) on the theme of Change.

'This
multi-layered and colourful scene encapsulates the constant change and 
adaptation of living space in a busy inner city: street art at the base 
commemorates the Shoreditch Festival; paving overhangs an underground 
car park; wooden railings are littered with graffiti tags; a mural, 
created by artist Neil Irons and ceramicist Stephen Bird, depicts the 
history of Charles Square; behind and above, the apartments are 
receiving a welcome face-lift.'

RPS President, Roy
Robertson Hon FRPS says: 'The International Print Exhibition, one of 
the oldest annual exhibitions in the world, is a highlight of The 
Society’s calendar. It is open to all photographers – amateur and 
professional, and attracts a range of photography from across the globe.

'It was reassuring 
this year, to see a significantly increased entry from younger 
photographers, With such a diverse entry, the exhibition each year takes
on a very different character, combining traditional images with very 
contemporary art and documentary work.

'Thank you to everyone who entered and congratulations go to all the successful photographers.'

The exhibition will run from 19 July to 9 September at the Allen & Overy offices in Bishops Square, London E1 6AD.
