Amir Khan's lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic are racing to get his American visa reinstated in time for him to be ringside in Las Vegas for Floyd Mayweather’s latest big-money extravaganza on Saturday night.

Khan was turned back at Manchester airport on Thursday as he tried to check-in for a Virgin Atlantic flight to Sin City.

No explanation was given, but the issue is likely to be a recurrence of previous difficulties which have arisen as a result of him being flagged up as being suspicious because of his name and his frequent visits to his family’s Pakistan homeland.

Others members of his team have experienced similar difficulties in the past.

But Britain’s two-time World Champion was told only that there was a problem and with the visa, which was issued a week ago.

Khan’s legal team in Los Angeles are busy petitioning the US immigration authorities, while he and his British solicitors are seeking an emergency meeting with the US Embassy in London.

One member of Team Khan said: ‘Amir needs to make an appearance in Vegas to keep pressing for his own flight with Floyd.’

Khan was in Miami just a couple of weeks ago and has visited American frequently of late.

He is due to go into training in San Francisco under American trainer Virgil Hunter on Monday and was planning to travel on from Las Vegas.

Khan is seeking an opponent for a December 6 fight, which is also expected to take place in the US.

He is still urging Mayweather to meet him in May, always assuming the best pound for pound fighter in the world wins this weekend’s rematch with Marcos Maidana.

Khan has had previous difficulties with The US immigration service, being searched for several hours on arrival there four years ago.  

Floyd Mayweather v Marcos Maidana will be televised live on BoxNation on Saturday night.
