A diabetic schoolgirl's trip to Spain has been ruined after she was told days before the journey that she can't go abroad with her classmates - because her school aren't insured to help with her condition.

Lucy Harrison, 12, was due to join her classmates from Forge Valley Community School in Sheffield on a five-day break to Granada in southern Spain next week, in a trip that her parents had paid for last year.

But this week, just nine days before the holiday, Lucy's parents say they were told by the school that she could not go after all because the school did not have the right insurance and staff were not allowed to administer medication if the girl fell ill.

Going nowhere: Lucy Harrison, 12, left, and right with father Stephen, 40, and the insulin pump she relies on

Lucy's father Stephen Harrison, 40, of Sheffield, said: 'I don't think it is acceptable - it is so unfair.

'All her mates are going and Lucy said "Why can't I when everybody else can?"

'I had to tell her it was because of her diabetes. This is discrimination.

'Isn't it hard enough having to deal with diabetes and then be singled out saying she can't go as though she is different to other children?

'The staff member said the school wasn't insured and also they can't touch Lucy if she has a hypoglycemic attack. All they can do is give her painkillers and a plaster.

'The risk assessment for this should have been done months ago, not nine days before the flight.'

Lucy was due to fly to Granada in southern Spain, famous for the Moorish Alhambra palace

Lucy, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of five, takes regular insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels.

Forge Valley Community College offered to refund the family or cover half the cost of one parent travelling with Lucy, but Mr Harrison, a former professional snooker player who now coaches children in the sport, said he could not have taken the time off work to accompany Lucy at such short notice.

He said the family was encouraging Lucy to cope with her condition, but said the school should do more to help with such a common condition.

'Lucy is just getting to grips with her diabetes. We want her to be able to manage it independently,' he said.

'She can't be the only person in school with diabetes. The school should have a policy in place.'

No-one at Forge Valley Community School was available for comment today.
