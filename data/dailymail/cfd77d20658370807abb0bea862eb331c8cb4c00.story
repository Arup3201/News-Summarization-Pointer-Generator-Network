They are widely regarded as ‘healthy’ options, guilt-free alternatives to snacks such as crisps and chocolate.

But most of us are unaware that many of 
the dips and spreads, such as hummus, that we believe are better for us 
are in fact very high in calories, a survey has shown.

The World Cancer Research Fund study revealed a ‘troubling’ lack of knowledge regarding the calorie content of foods.

High energy: Hummus, which is made from chickpeas, pictured has a surprisingly high calorie content

A survey conducted for the charity found two thirds of Britons underestimate the number of calories in hummus.

The dip, made from chickpeas, contains 
on average 332 calories per 100g – more than  10 per cent of the 
recommended daily intake for women.

But, despite exceeding the ‘high’ level 
of ‘energy density’ as defined by the WCRF, which applies to food 
containing more than about 225 calories per 100g, it is widely 
considered to be ‘healthy’.

The YouGov poll of 2,000 people also 
found that only 29 per cent knew that even reduced-fat mayonnaise was 
high in calories.

It has an average of 259 per 100g. And while many 
underestimated the energy content of less healthy snacks, a fifth of 
those polled overestimated the calorie count in bananas.

They described the fruit as high in calories, when it in fact contains only 95 per 100g.

The WCRF said the lack of calorie 
awareness was a concern because of the many diseases associated with 
being overweight or obese, which include cancer.

A spokesman said: ‘It seems a lot of people are still confused about the calorie content of everyday foods.

‘This troubling lack of understanding is
perhaps not helped by labels such as 'light' and 'reduced fat' when 
these are applied to foods which still have a high calorie content.

‘At this time of year many people make 
New Year’s resolutions to lose weight but to do this it is important 
that they understand how to determine whether a food is high in 
calories.'
