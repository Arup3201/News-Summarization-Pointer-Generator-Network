Traumatised: Roy, a 26-year-old Congo African Grey, pecked off all his feathers during three years in captivity

A parrot has been put on anti-depressants to recover from a state of manic trauma after being trapped in a garage for three years.

Roy was locked in a dog cage with little food or water as he kept screaming the name of his owner's dead wife over and over again - after the widower's new partner had moved in.

In captivity, with little food or water, the Congo African Grey was driven to near-insanity, pecking off all his feathers.

The 26-year-old bird is now being treated by Britain's only parrot psychologist Elaine Henley, who has started him on an intensive programme of pills.

Ms Henley, who provides respite for pets taken in by Parrot Rescue UK, saved Roy from imprisonment in the home in southern England.

In more than 10 years treating birds as far away as Australia and America, Roy is the most disturbed pet she has encountered.

Ms Henley, 44, said: 'Heâ€™s so traumatised from his years in the garage which he will never get over.'

Roy had been close to his owner Sarah before she died - and would not stop calling for her when she passed away.

But Sarah's widower eventually met somebody else, and decided to lock Roy away until they moved house three years later.

When they contacted Parrot Rescue UK to give him away, the in-house vets were shocked by his state.

Ms Henley said: 'After being left alone for all that time, Roy's new owners decided to give him up as they were moving house and didn't want to take him with them.

'They called the charity and said "you need to come get this bird, we're off" and put him out on the doorstep and shut the door.

Medication: Parrot psychologist Elaine Henley has taken him in a put him on a programme of prozac-like drugs

'He was brought up to me because the charity said I was the only one who would be able to help such a traumatised bird.'

In
 a desperate bid to nurse him back to health, Ms Henley is lacing Roy's 
food with amitriptyline - a powerful anti-depressant similar to Prozac.

He is given 0.1ml of the drug a day.

'Before a vet prescribes the drug, though, theyâ€™ll explore all other possible options that can be used to try stop their stress and troublesome behaviour,' she said.

Glasgow-based Ms Henley has even taken Roy in as her own.

After just a few weeks, he is already picking up her strong Scottish accent - shared by her existing pet parrot Milo.

She said: 'They're much smarter than people think.'
