Sordid: Sarah Symonds, 44, has revealed that Max Clifford arranged to have sex with her in the disabled toilet in his Mayfair office

A former ‘professional mistress’ famous for an alleged affair with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, has today revealed she slept with convicted sex offender Max Clifford in a toilet specially adapted for his disabled daughter.

Sarah Symonds, 44, says that she was led to the disabled cubicle by Clifford at his PR company's Mayfair office after a business meeting.

Writing in her column for a Welsh newspaper, Ms Symonds says Clifford boasted about cheating on his wife and showed her explicit pictures of his mistress.

Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years on Friday for eight years after being convicted of a string of sex offences.

A jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of eight indecent assaults, which took place on four victims aged 15 to 19 between the years of 1978 and 1984.

The court heard how Max thought he was 'untouchable' because of his celebrity links, which allowed him to intimidate his victims into staying silent for more than 30 years.

It was heard that after assaulting the women he would warn that nobody would believe them if they spoke out.

Ms Symonds, of Newport, Gwent, reveals in her Wales on Sunday newspaper column that she had sex with Clifford in the office toilet specially adapted for his daughter Louise, 42, who suffers from autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis.

She said: ‘The thing that would shock - and sicken - me the most, was when I found out Max Clifford's casting couch would turn out to be his daughter's specially adapted disabled toilet cubicle.

‘That is something I can't ever forget.’

Ms Symonds was visiting Max Clifford Associates’s New Bond Street office to discuss PR work for her and a dating site.

She wrote: ‘As soon as I sat down in the leather chair in Clifford's office, he blurted out: "I was an adulterer all through my marriage. I've had tons of affairs."

‘He then opened the top left hand drawer of his desk and pulled out a picture of a woman in a very compromising position.'

‘I won't go into who he told me it was, nor how and why he even had the photo, but take it from me, to say I was shocked would be an understatement. He went on to elaborate about his grimy sex secrets, and the way he operated.

‘By now my head was spinning. I didn't know whether to feel flattered that he was confiding this information so soon after meeting me, or completely grossed out at how he disgusting he was. But, I needed him.

‘He went on to tell me more disgusting pieces of information about his sex life, as well as enlightening me about his sexual cravings.

‘I truly didn't know if he was trying to impress me, flirt with me, or ask for some kind of retribution. It was the most bizarre experience I had ever had, and I've had many.

‘I asked him how he'd never ‘got caught’, and why any of this had never been in the media.

‘He replied: ‘You will never read anything negative about me, the press need me too much. I have them in the palm of my hand.’

‘And he pointed to various framed front-page stories he had brokered for numerous people.

‘He gave me a personally signed copy of his autobiography to read and also boasted about Rebecca Loos and her story with David Beckham that he handled.

‘I was blown away by what I was hearing, and disappointed that the family-man caring image he put across in the media was all just a sham.’

Ms Symonds, pictured on ITV's Lorraine Live last year, revealed the details of her sordid business meeting with Clifford in her newspaper column

She told how she was ‘deflated’ when 
Clifford said it would cost her £15,000 a month for his company to 
represent her for public relations.

She
 writes: ‘Then, Max did something else. He propositioned me there and 
then in his office. He told me how we could have some fun together and 
that ‘we could look after each other.’

‘He
 also went on to tell me that if the dating site would agree to his fees
 then he would help me out in the media, and promote my book on the 
side, for free.

‘I realise 
now, in hindsight, he was grooming me. He then gave me his mobile 
number, and I gave him mine, and as I was about to leave, he suggested I
 meet him in the office toilets.

‘I was shell-shocked. I made an excuse and I left to go back to my hotel.

‘I'd been booked to go back for a follow-up meeting with him two days later, which I did. He and I had also shared a few texts in between.

‘As I sat down in the leather chair again, I realised this second meeting was going to be more about business. Albeit somewhat monkey-business, but business nevertheless.

‘Max told me he'd looked at my book, and liked it. He said he would like to put me in touch with a publisher friend of his.

‘He'd also read the reality show concept I'd written - based on infidelity and getting people to STOP cheating - and said he'd liked it a lot.

‘I'll get this in front of Simon [Cowell] if you want me to and if he likes it he may help you too,’ he stated confidently.

‘He went on to flatter me (it gets you everywhere right?) by telling me that I had a great message and I was bringing something new and different to the market with my work. 

'Business meeting': Ms Symonds and Clifford had sex in the disabled toilet of the offices of Max Clifford Associates in London's Mayfair

‘He said I had some great ideas, I was smart and articulate, I was a good-looking girl, and that I just needed a bit of luck.

‘By now I was really starting to see a pattern about how this man operated. You scratch my back (and other parts) and I'll scratch yours.

‘You stroke my ego (and other parts) and I'll stroke yours. I could see I was going to have to go along with it all if I had any hope of making it in this business.

‘I was naïve and desperate in many ways, but I wasn't a kid and I wasn't stupid. I had lived and worked in LA and knew all about the casting couches.

‘In hindsight that's how toxic this business can be, and how desperate people can be to get a break into it. I'm not proud of any of this, and I began to wonder how - in the space of just a few days - my business meetings with Max Clifford could have possibly turned into what it was becoming.

‘We chatted on a few other ideas, and 
he called in his PR manager to join us and take some follow-up notes, 
and to make sure the dating site received his fee proposal contract the 
next day.

‘After she exited,
 and as our meeting was coming to a close, Max made it clear that I was 
to go to the toilets outside the main office door when I left, and to 
wait for him in there. ‘But Max,’ I said nervously, ‘What if any of the 
girls out in the office see me going in there and you coming in?’

‘Don't worry it's foolproof,’ he replied. ‘It will just look like you're turning left to get into the lift down to the lobby.’

‘He was right. I guessed he had given these instructions before. 

Max Clifford's  daughter Louise, 42, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, has been working with her father for 14 years and gave evidence defending him during his trial

‘As I took the walk of shame towards the location of the Max Clifford Associates's toilets, the thing that would shock - and sicken - me the most, was when I found out Max Clifford's casting couch would turn out to be his daughter's specially adapted disabled toilet cubicle.

‘That is something I can't ever forget.

‘But what could I do? I was there now, I was in the toilet, and that lock was about to be turned. Literally!

‘Without going into detail here, none of what happened in there was a pleasant experience for me, although it seemed to be for him.

‘He was extremely controlling and acted as if he was on a mission. All I kept thinking was that I hoped something would come out of it. Sadly it never did.

‘Unsurprisingly, all the promises of help with my career never ever materialised. It saddens and sickens me to my stomach to this very day.’

Ms Symonds is just one of a string of women who has come forward in the wake of the guilty verdict.

Yesterday former dancer Sharon Elliott, 48, from Cheltenham, revealed she brutally assaulted by disgraced PR guru Max Clifford in a nightclub toilet cubicle 30 years ago.

Earlier this week, a woman, using the pseudonym Cathy Johnson, partially waived her anonymity to speak of how she was abused by Clifford aged 15.

Max Clifford’s daughter Louise, 42, vehemently defended her father in court but prosecutors said she was tainted by her blind loyalty to her father.

Upon his conviction, she showed no emotion in the public gallery and stood by his side as he left court.

Ms Clifford was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when she was six and has undergone a string of operations. She has worked for her father for the past 14 years.
