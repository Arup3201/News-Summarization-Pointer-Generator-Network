Kerry Kennedy said today that people were 'wrong' to accuse her of relying on her powerful family name to beat a drugged driving charge last week.

The 54-year-old daughter of Robert F. Kennedy was acquitted last Friday after she accidentally took a sleeping pill which caused her to lose control and hit a tractor-trailer while driving down a New York highway in 2012.

Ms Kennedy told the Today show on Monday that her access to 'wonderful lawyers' helped her win the case - along with the fact she was innocent.

Kerry Kennedy told the Today show on Monday that she was fortunate her wealth allowed her access to 'confident counsel' to beat a drugged driving charge

She told Today that it was 'great to have this off my mind' after being found not guilty of the charge at a court in White Plains, New York on Friday.

Ms Kennedy said that she didn't think her family name was why she was acquitted but acknowledged that having substantial financial means to hire the best lawyers played a part.

She said 'they [the jury] found me innocent because I was innocent' but also thanked her 'wonderful lawyers' along with her family, friends and God. 

Kennedy, a human rights activist, described the trial as a 'scary process'. She said that she beat the misdemeanor charge because she had the means to fight the case in court which few people do and instead take a plea which can have a 'devastating impact on lives'.

The 54-year-old said she refused a plea deal because it could damage her career as a human rights activist and prevent travel to Canada, Australia and New Zealand for up to ten years. Kennedy is the president of the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights.

Talking about her case, she added: 'This was 20 months. It was a week off from work - I wasn’t going to be fired from my job.'

She faced up to a year in jail for the misdemeanor charge although this would have been unlikely 
for a first-time offender.

Ms Kennedy said on Monday: 'We've got to pass legislation which will allow people to have access to competent counsel no matter who they are.'

Ms Kennedy, the ex-wife of New York 
Governor Andrew Cuomo and niece of President John F. Kennedy, left court
 on Friday saying she was 'incredibly grateful' for the verdict, 
adding: 'I'm happy justice was done.'

She went on to say that she plans to 'celebrate' and won't be holding a grudge.

Grateful: Kerry Kennedy left court on Friday with her elderly mother Ethel Kennedy, daughter Cara Kennedy Cuomo and 'wonderful lawyers'

Ms Kennedy's 85-year-old mother, Ethel Kennedy, 
and other members of their famous family attended the trial, which drew 
so much attention that it was moved from a small-town courtroom to a 
bigger courthouse in White Plains.

The case was based around an accident when her car hit a tractor-trailer in 2012. She was found slumped at the steering wheel.

Kennedy said she took the sleeping pill 
by mistake instead of her thyroid medication. She testified that the 
drug overpowered her and she doesn't remember the crash.

The biggest question in the case was not whether she had taken the sleeping pill by mistake since both the prosecution and the defense agreed on that point.

The problematic point was whether or not she realized she was impaired when she finally pulled over.

The prosecution said even if the pill were taken accidentally, Kennedy should have pulled over when she felt its effects. 

Police said she failed several sobriety tests at the scene but passed several tests a few hours later at a police station.

'If I realized I was impaired, I would have pulled over,' Kennedy testified.

A
 few days later, Kennedy said her doctors believed it was caused by a 
seizure, stemming from a brain injury early in her life. Then blood 
tests found a small amount of zolpidem, sometimes sold under the brand 
name Ambien.

Kennedy was arrested in 2012 on a misdemeanor charge of driving while impaired.

She
 had driven her Lexus wildly on a highway, sideswiping a 
tractor-trailer, blowing one of her tires and yet continuing to the next
 exit, witnesses testified.

Blood tests showed a small amount of zolpidem, sometimes sold under the brand name Ambien.

Prosecutor Doreen Lloyd disputed Kennedy's account, suggesting in a closing argument on Thursday that the human rights advocate ignored the onset of symptoms because 'she had a schedule to meet.'

And while Kennedy took the pill by mistake, 'she is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that,' Lloyd said.

She insisted zolpidem works gradually, saying Kennedy's testimony 'belies the science of this drug.'Mocking the title of one of Kennedy's own books, Lloyd urged the jury to 'speak truth to power.'

But defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt said there was no evidence - and it made no sense to believe - that Kennedy was aware, while driving, that she'd taken the pill.

'Accidents are not crimes,' Lefcourt said.

With Kennedy's mother, Ethel, and 
other relatives in the front row, Lefcourt said Kennedy was 'not seeking
 advantage because of her family'.

The trial is 'not a TV call-in program,' he said. 'This is an American court.'

Douglas Kennedy- Kerry's brother- Acquitted of harassment and child endangerment after kicking a nurse in the maternity ward as he tried to leave the hospital with his newborn child in 2012. Like Kerry, he brought up his father's assassination during his testimony in the courtroom, saying that he wanted to bring the newborn out of the hospital in order to spend time with it like he was never able to do with his father.

Senator Ted Kennedy- Kerry's uncle- Infamously drove off a bridge in Cappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts in 1969, killing his passenger Mary Joe Kopechne. He fled the scene of the accident and didn't report it for nine hours, during which time Ms Kopechne died. He received a two month suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to leaving the scene of a crime.

Former Congressman Patrick Kennedy- Kerry's cousin- Crashed his car into a Capitol Hill barricade at 2.45am in May 2006. The then-Congressman from Rhode Island, who has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, initially claimed that he was disoriented due to Ambien- the same drug that was in Kerry's system at the time of her crash- but he also had reportedly been drinking. He went to rehab and made a deal with prosecutors that by pleading guilty to driving under the influence, he would be let off with one year's probation and a $350 fine.

William Kennedy Smith- Kerry's cousin- Acquitted of rape after he was charged following a sexual encounter with a woman in Palm Beach in 1991. He was out at a bar with his uncle Ted and Ted's son Patrick (both mentioned above) when they met two young women. The group went back to the Kennedy's house in the area and William, then 30, went on a walk on the beach with one of the women, aged 29. She claimed he raped her while he said they had consensual sex. He was acquitted of all charges. He later had a sexual assault case brought on by a female coworker dismissed in 2005 and settled out of court when a second such case was brought that same year.

Mary Richardson Kennedy- Kerry's deceased sister-in-law- Just days after her husband Robert Kennedy Jr filed for divorce, Mary was charged with drunk driving in May 2010. She pled guilty and had her license suspended, but was arrested for drugged driving a month later. The mother-of-four killed herself in May 2012.

Michael Skakel- Kerry's cousin- Charged with the 1975 murder of his 15-year-old neighbor Martha Moxley and spent 11 years behind bars following a 2002 conviction but he has been released from jail while he awaits a new trial. A judge recently allowed him to have a GPS tracking device moved from his ankle to a different part of his body so that he can fit his foot in a ski boot.
