Success: Smiling Lucy Johns, pictured with driving instructor Andy Roberts, has passed her driving test so that she can fulfil her dying wish of taking her son Stanley to school for the first time

A mother who is terminally ill with breast, bone and liver cancer has learned to drive so that she can fulfil her dying wish - to do the school run.

Lucy Johns, 30, has to stay in hospital for weeks at a time while she undergoes draining chemotherapy, but she still found the time to pass her driving test so that she can drop son Stanley, six, at school for the first time.

She passed the test first time despite being involved in an accident the day before and will drive Stanley to St Paul's Roman Catholic Primary School in Plymouth, Devon, on Monday.

Lucy, of Plymouth, Devon, said: 'All of a sudden I was in hospital for four weeks at a time and Stanley couldn't understand why he was being passed around friends and relatives.

'When he started school my friend took him and he started getting upset and asking why I never went with him.

'Then I would get upset because he'd talk about his friends and teachers and I wouldn't know anything about them.

'I would wave him off at the door then have no idea exactly who was looking after him at school. As a mother that's really tough.

She added: 'That was the main reason I decided to drive but also to do the simple things like driving to the park just so I can watch my kids play.

'It's easy to take these moments for granted but they have become absolutely precious for me.'

Lucy and her husband Pete, 33, were told of her illness following the birth of their second child Lillie-Lou, who is now aged two.

She had to wait until she had given birth to undergo tests on a mass in her chest.

Scans revealed that Lucy had breast cancer and that it had spread to her bones and liver.

She said: 'It was awful.

'My cancer is incurable and I am classed as terminally ill but I am having treatment so I can live and be a mum for as long as possible.'

Kind-hearted local driving instructors gave Lucy 45 hours of free driving lessons after she spoke of her determination to pass her test.

She was so desperate to pass as quickly as possible that she sometimes had four hour long lessons.

But she was left shaken the day before her test when another motorist drove into the back of her learner car.

Lucy said: 'I was so nervous for my test I did not think I would pass. I am so excited now. I wanted to get this so much.

'Sometimes I would have a lesson lasting three or four hours. That was almost too much but nothing was going to stop me.'
