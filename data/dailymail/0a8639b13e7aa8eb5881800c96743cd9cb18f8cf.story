Neil deGrasse Tyson has hit back at criticism that he is 'anti-Christian' after he posted a series of tweets on Christmas Day that left him facing accusations that he had deliberately 'trolled' the Christian holiday.

The astrophysicist's tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton on December 25 has since been retweeted more than 70,000 times, making it his most popular tweet ever and also his most controversial.

'On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642,' he tweeted.

The TV personality followed it up with another tweet that also inflamed conservative Christians: 'Merry Christmas to all. A Pagan holiday (BC) becomes a Religious holiday (AD). Which then becomes a Shopping holiday (USA).'

Earlier in the day, he had also tweeted, 'QUESTION: This year, what do all the world's Muslims and Jews call December 25th? ANSWER: Thursday.'

Sure enough, Tyson found himself on the receiving end of a Twitter backlash from Christians who found his gentle mocking too much to take.

'This is disrespectful to Christians. Jesus created the science you cherish so much. Everyone finds God eventually, you will too,' tweeted one user.

Another tweeted: 'Looking fwd to witty jabs during the spiritual days of Islam, Buddhism, Judaism etc. Or is it reserved for the easiest target?'

'Overly reductive, deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative,' tweeted another person who had taken offence.

Tyson posted a series of Christmas-related tweets on December 25 and the next day responded to accusations from conservative Christians that he was 'anti-Christian' 

Tyson expressed his surprise at how popular the tweet had been and denied that he was 'somehow anti-Christian'

While elsewhere he was accused of 'trolling Christmas today to show you how smart he is.'

Tyson responded to the accusations the next day with another tweet: 'Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them.'

Later on Friday evening he posted a longer message on Facebook entitled 'My Most Retweeted Tweet' in which he expressed his surprise at how popular the Newton tweet had been.

'My sense in this case is that the high rate of re-tweeting, is not to share my enthusiasm of this fact, but is driven by accusations that the tweet is somehow anti-Christian,' he wrote.

'If a person actually wanted to express anti-Christian sentiment, my guess is that alerting people of Isaac Newton's birthday would appear nowhere on the list.'

Tyson also went on to address criticism that according to the calendar in use during Newton's time, his birthday would fall on January 4, 1643.

'One last bit of historical fact. All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. But the Gregorian Calendar (an awesomely accurate reckoning of Earth's annual time), introduced in 1584 by Pope Gregory, was not yet adopted in Great Britain. 

'To do so required removing ten days from the calendar — excess time that had accumulated over the previous 16 centuries from the mildly flawed Julian Calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. 

'These remnants of the turbulent schism between the Anglican and Catholic churches meant that Catholic Christendom was celebrating Christmas ten days earlier than anybody was in England.'

Tyson ended his note with holiday wishes and a warning that he'll be tweeting about Earth's perihelion in the New Year.

'Just a head's up in case people want to avert their eyes over that one.'

He signed off with: 'I am, and always will be, a servant of your cosmic curiosity.'
