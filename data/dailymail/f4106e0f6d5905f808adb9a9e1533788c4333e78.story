Barcelona will appear in front of FIFA on Wednesday in a bid to have their two-window transfer embargo reduced on appeal.

Just days after hearing that Luis Suarez would not have his ban for biting reduced - though the forward is now allowed to train with the club and made his debut in a friendly on Monday - the Catalans will once again plead their case for leniency.

FIFA announced in April that Barca would be unable to sign any players for two transfer windows due to the 'international transfer of minors', but the Spanish giants immediately appealed the decision.

That caused their embargo being indefinitely postponed - leading to the signing of five players this summer.

The most notable arrival was the £75million acquisition of Suarez from Liverpool.

Thomas Vermaelen, Jeremy Mathieu, Claudio Bravo and Ivan Rakitic also joined the Catalans this summer. 

Even if FIFA reject Barca's appeal then they could still take the case further to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in a bid to have the punishment rescinded.
