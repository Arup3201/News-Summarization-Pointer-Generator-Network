An Ohio woman is begging on the streets but she’s not homeless or desperately hungry - she wants bigger breasts.

Much to the dismay of fellow beggars who desperately need money for food or a roof over their heads, the bikini-clad woman has been making money and turning heads with her plea for plastic surgery.

Holding a sign that reads ‘Not homeless. Need boobs’ the woman, who only identifies herself as Chrissy, 37, has been standing on a busy street corner in Akron, Ohio.

Begging for boobs: Chrissy, 37, believes her 'original' idea standing on a busy street corner will help her raise $5,058 for breast implants

Chrissy, from Rittman, Ohio, has been standing on the corner of Manchester Road and Carnegie Avenue in Akron near a blue motorbike with her sign and bodyguard.

She said: ‘I see people panhandling (begging) everyday, so why not panhandle for boobs.

‘It's original. I've never seen anybody else do it.’

Bills but not breasts: The money Chrissy earns as a bartender covers her bills and education, but not the cost of getting silicone breast implants (pictured)

Chrissy believes her ‘original’ idea is proving successful after she made $46 in just two hours standing on the curb.

She plans to continue begging on the intersection until she reaches $5,058.

The
 university student and single mother says the money she earns as a 
bartender covers her bills and education costs but it’s not enough money for 
breast implants.

Chrissy said: ‘Everyone that knows me, knows that I am a wild one.’

There to be her bodyguard is friend Steve Bernabe, 57, of Akron, working free of charge, who says she’s not begging but being honest.

He said: ‘She's just trying to move on in her life and build herself up.’

She’s attracted the attention of many motorists with some honking their horns and others requesting pictures.

Tyesha Hercegovac, 27, of Ellet, took a picture of Chrissy for her husband before heading home.

She said: ‘I think it's kind of ridiculous, but kind of funny in a way.

‘She wants her boobs. She's keeping it real.’

One woman was less than impressed, giving Chrissy the evil eye and a few stern words.

Chrissy said: ‘He's (Mr Bernabe) just making sure I'm OK because there is some negativity out there.’
