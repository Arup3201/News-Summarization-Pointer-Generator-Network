Two former Navy SEALs found dead aboard the Maersk Alabama last week had suffered respiratory failure caused by a possible heroin overdose.

Seychelles police today said security guards Mark Daniel Kennedy, 43, and Jeffrey 
Keith Reynolds, 44, may have suffered heart attacks, with a syringe and traces of heroin found in their cabin.

The samples are being sent to 
Mauritius to establish if the drugs were responsible for the deaths.

After the incident, a government official told CNN the presence of drug traces and paraphernalia 'would suggest that their deaths were a result of drug overdose.'

Reynolds and Kennedy worked for Trident 
Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm.

The company's 
president, Tom Rothrauff, confirmed to CNN the men were former Navy 
SEALs.

'It's bizarre. Of course, it's a shock. They're all great guys,' Rothrauff said. 'I'm absolutely clueless as to what happened.'

Before working as security guards, the men belonged to the SEALs, an elite unit of the military's special 
operations forces who are sometimes called upon to combat piracy.

The Maersk Alabama is a Norfolk, Va.-based 
container ship that provides feeder service to the east coast of Africa 
and employs security contractors to provide anti-piracy services.

Kevin
 N. Speers, a senior director for Maersk Line, said in a statement the deaths of Reynolds and Kennedy were 'not related to vessel operations or their duties as 
security personnel.'

Work: Mark Kennedy was employed by Trident Group to work on the Maersk Alabama, which had been hijacked by pirates in 2009 and later dramatized on screen

The Maersk Alabama ship gained international attention in April 2009 when four armed pirates tried to hijack it 380 miles off Somalia.

After the crew foiled their efforts to take control of the container ship, the pirates took the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, hostage.

The incident ended three days later when Navy SEALs killed three of the pirates and captured the fourth. Phillips was unharmed.

The incident was dramatized in the 2013 movie 'Captain Phillips' starring Tom Hanks.
