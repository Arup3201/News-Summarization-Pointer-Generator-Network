A housewife who groomed underage boys for sex by plying them with alcohol and letting them smoke cannabis at her house was sent to prison today.

Chantelle Goatley, 36, who sent one boy a Facebook message saying: 'Vodka, weed, me.  What more could you ask for?' was jailed for four-and-a-half-years after being convicted of sex and drugs offences at Reading Crown Court today.

Goatley, from Newbury, Berkshire, who had claimed that the allegations made by the two boys, aged 14 and 15 at the time, were lies, was convicted of three of the five counts she faced.

Jailed: Chantelle Goatley, 36, was convicted of three sex and drugs offences at Reading Crown Court today

The jury at Reading Crown Court heard that Goatley exchanged messages with one boy on Facebook, including one which said: 'You’ve got 18 bottles of Stella and loads of weed to have. xx.'

Minutes later she added: 'Vodka, weed, me. What more could you ask for?'

She had been accused of having sex with one boy and performing a sex act on him and on another boy, on separate occasions.

However, jurors acquitted her on the two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child.

They found her guilty of allowing her premises to be used for smoking cannabis, of committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity between January and April last year.

Prosecutor Matthew Walsh said: 'They were still children and she knew their ages.

'The address she was living at became a popular place for these boys to spend their time, particularly at weekends.

'There was alcohol ready for them to drink, which she bought. There was cannabis there for them to smoke.

Court: Judge Johannah Cutts QC sentenced Goatley to jail and told her to sign the Sex Offenders' Register

'But there was more to it. This wasn’t just provision of alcohol and cannabis.

'There was a motive behind it. It was grooming, grooming these young boys... because when they were drunk or, to use the common expression, stoned, struggling to function normally, she would be in a position to take advantage.

'The prosecution case is that is what she did. She took advantage.'

Goatley was sentenced by Judge Johannah Cutts QC to four years for causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, 18 months to run concurrently for committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence, and six months to run consecutively for allowing cannabis to be smoked in her home.

She will also have to sign on to the Sex Offenders' Register.
