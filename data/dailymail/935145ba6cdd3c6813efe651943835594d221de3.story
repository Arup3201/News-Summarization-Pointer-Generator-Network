A former Apple executive considered the brains behind the iPod has claimed fired iOS boss Scott Forstall 'got what he deserved' when he was sacked over the maps debacle.

The former senior vice president of Apple's iPod division Tony Fadell, who left the company in 2008, said the decision to fire Forstall was 'justified'.

Forstall was asked to leave Apple after his refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the company's much-criticized mapping software and years of friction with other top executives.

A difficult road ahead: Apple's maps were 
slammed for their poor location information and distorted images, 
forcing the company into issuing an apology

Forstall's departure has been welcomed by many of his former colleagues - including Fadell who claims the move is good for the company.

Fadell told the BBC: 'I think what happened just a few weeks back was deserved and justified and it happened.

'If you read some of the reports, people were cheering in Cupertino when that event happened.

'I think Apple is in a great space, it has great products and there are amazing people at the company, and those people actually have a chance to have a firm footing now and continue the legacy Steve left.'

The problematic map app was described by Apple at the time as 'the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.'

But the map app, which replaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism.

Within hours CEO Tim Cook had issued an apology to customers and Apple was recommending customers use alternative apps while the company worked at improve their own dismal offering.

Sources claimed Forstall had refused to sign the public apology forcing Cook to sign the letter instead.  

Apple's maps was plagued with problems

People with knowledge of Apple's 
inner workings said Scott Forstall's departure was years in the making, and 
came to a head with the Apple Maps incident.

A 15-year veteran of the company, 
Forstall was once considered a possible CEO candidate and is credited 
with playing a central role in making the iPhone and the iPad two of the
 most successful consumer electronics products ever.

But Forstall was also considered a 
hard person to work with, and he alienated other senior executives with 
his abrasive style, one person familiar with the situation said.

This person added that once Jobs passed away, Forstall was left with few defenders at the top of the company.

The fate of the executive, who had 
1,000 people directly reporting to him, was sealed by the Maps debacle.

Even after a public uproar over the shortcomings and widespread calls 
for Apple to revert to Google Maps, Forstall would not acknowledge the 
gravity of the problem, a source with knowledge of the matter said.

Forstall instead likened the situation
 to the complaints over the antenna in an earlier iPhone and insisted it
 would blow over without a public mea culpa, the source said. But CEO Tim Cook 
disagreed, and issued a public apology with his own signature on it 
after Fortstall would not go along, the source added.
