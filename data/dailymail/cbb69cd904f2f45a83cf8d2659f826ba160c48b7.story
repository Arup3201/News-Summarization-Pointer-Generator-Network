A Dallas beautician sent a would-be robber running Sunday when she splashed his face in scalding hot wax.

Teresa Mendez had just gotten home top her front door after work when a man with a knife approached her out of nowhere and demanded money.

Mendez had none, but the man wouldn’t leave her along. That’s when she gave him an eyebrow waxing he’ll never forget.

All in a day's work: Dallas beautician Teresa Mendez thought on her feet when a knife wielding man tried to rob her, flinging a pot of hot hair removal wax right in his face

Who needs pepper spray? Mendez shows off the warming but she was carrying, then turned into a weapon of self defense, on Sunday evening

The family joked to NBCDFW that police should just keep an eye out for a man with burns all over his face and back.

But as ingenious as Mendez’s self-defense tactic was, it didn’t come to her immediately.

She first tried brandishing another hair removal product: a sharp pair of scissors.

The assailant still wouldn’t leave, so Mendez had to think fast.

Her turf: It was 8 o'clock and Mendez had just gotten off work when the man approached her in front of her home

In one hand she held a bag of cosmetics products from work. In the other was a warming pot of searing hot body wax.

Putting two and two together, she acted—flinging the sticky goo right in his face.

The man, who Mendez described as African American ran, presumably having suffered serious burns, and got into a car with two other men.

Tools of the trade: Mendez says she first tried brandishing scissors at the man. It was when that didn't work that she flung the wax

Her husband Antonio James arrived home shortly after the startling encounter and at first he wondered why his wife didn’t just hand over the bag of beauty supplies.

‘She said, “He tried to steal my bag,”’ James told NBCDFW. “I thought she was talking about her purse. She said, “No, my plastic bag!” I said, “Oh my God, just leave it there.”’

He’s since realized the robber never had a chance.

‘He thought he could scare her, and she doesn’t scare,’ James laughed.

'She doesn't scare': Mendez's husband Antonio James at first wondered why his wife didn't just give up her bag of cosmetics, but admitted that the robber probably never had a chance against his wife
