Bolivia is in turmoil with hundreds of police now on the sixth day of a strike and 1,000 indigenous protesters preparing to march on the capital.

The government is struggling to reach a deal with the police and has portrayed the action as a budding 'coup d'etat'.

Uniformed officers today continued to demonstrate in front of the gates of the heavily-guarded palace, while public workers showed their support for president Evo Morales at a rally in a square on the outskirts of La Paz.

'I wish that they didn't call for this 
act of public support because regrettably there are going to be 
confrontations and the situation is going to get worse,' warned 
Guadalupe Cardenas, leader of a police wives' group.

The arrival of 1,000 indigenous natives after a long march from the Amazon situation was only expected to inflame the troubled situation today.

The natives, who are protesting against plans to build a highway through their ancestral homeland, have
delayed their entry into the city to fend off accusations from the government that they were only there to back the police 
mutiny.

Indigenous leader Bertha Bejarano said: 'From nine in the morning [today], we will take up the road again heading for the seat of government.

'The government ought to find a 
solution for the problems with the police and should not confuse their 
action with our march,' he added, from their encampment 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) north of the capital.

Reiterating the government line that
police are setting the stage for a coup, communications minister 
Amanda Davila declared on public radio that the mutiny 'is not 
just any kind of movement.'

'They have the power of weaponry, of 
tear gas, and of all the tools' that are now being turned against the 
state, he said, citing alleged explosive attacks on Congress and on a 
radio station as evidence.

In further evidence of the growing tensions, the governors of eight of Bolivia's nine departments - all except Santa Cruz - put out statements of support for Mr Morales, apparently prompted by his officials.

Governor of the La Paz department, Cesar Cocarico, said: 'We reject and condemn the aims and objectives of conspirators and rebel groups that are causing violence and whose actions are aimed at destabilising the democratic process by promoting a coup.'

As police representatives entered a new round of talks with three federal ministers, teachers joined hundreds of officers - normally their adversaries - to protest in La Paz's main square.

The strike presents a significant challenge to Mr Morales as it follows months of social unrest from miners, doctors, indigenous people and other groups frustrated with their low standard of living.

The Secretary General of the Organization of American States regional bloc, Jose Miguel Insulza, yesterday expressed growing concern over events in La Paz and called for a rapid solution.

In a written statement issued in Washington, he said: 'The strike by the armed body charged with guarding the public order generates, in and of itself, a sensation of uncertainty.

'But when a legitimate union demand appears to become confused with destabilising political objectives, that should worry us much more.'

Mr Insulza had 'known evidence of messages exchanged between people close to the strike, that utter threats against government ministers and make allusion to a possible coup,' the statement said.

A group of wives, mothers and widows of low-ranking police officers camped out on cardboard and straw mats in front of the riot police headquarters provide a visible symbol of the strike movement defying the government.

Francisca, the wife of a police sergeant, said: 'We sleep here, in the street, we have some blankets; it is very cold at night and all my bones are bad.'

The mother to six children aged between six and 20 added: 'My husband earns 1,200 bolivianos (£110) a month. Before I earned good money as a maid but now my hands are too bad and I can no longer work.'

The police are campaigning for a minimum pay hike to 2,000 bolivianos (£183), from the current average of £125 a month.

They also are demanding full pay upon retirement, a police ombudsman and the overturning of a law that bans them from publicly expressing their opinion.
