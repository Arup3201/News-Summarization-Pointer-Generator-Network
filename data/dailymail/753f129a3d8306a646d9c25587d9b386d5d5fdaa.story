The video was uploaded to Vimeo by user Anna Lazar.

A translation shows that the text says: 'Just yesterday we pierced the sand by the crystal clear waters with our heels. By the sound of the crashing waves, the audience viewed the strange spectacle of chicks wearing high heels on surf boards.'

The video shows them preparing for the competition by measuring their shoes.

The competitors also get used to being in the water in heels by diving into swimming pools.

First, the women look shaky on their boards as they balance on their heels and don lurid floral dresses.

But they soon get the hang of it, surfing flawlessly and having a lot of fun.

There has previously been controversy in the surfing world, as annual Californian surfing competition Mavericks refused to allow female competitors to enter.

Organisor Jeff Clark told Jezebel: ‘We're not there." He noted that this year's event has 24 invited competitors and 17 alternates - all of whom have put time in learning to excel at Mavericks - while dozens more men would love to get in.

‘We've got one day to hold an event for the best of the best. If in 10 years there are 10 or 12 women surfers who surf Mavericks, who knows?’
