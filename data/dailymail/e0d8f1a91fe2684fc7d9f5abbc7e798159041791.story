Chester, the false killer whale who was rescued off the shores of Tofino, British Columbia in Canada, has been moved to a new pool at the Vancouver Aquarium after a miraculous recovery.

The large-toothed 'blackfish' - which is similar in appearance to a killer whale but is a member of the dolphin family - has been in critical care at the popular tourist attraction's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre for the past five months.

The calf was initially unable to swim on its own when it was discovered by locals off North Chesterman Beach on Vancouver Island.

False killer whales have long, slender black or dark grey bodies with a narrow head and bulbous melon.

Adult males can grow up to 20ft in length, while adult females typically measure 15ft. Calves such as Chester are generally six feet in length.

The first night after his rescue, staff at the aquarium were unsure whether the calf would pull through, as he was unable to swim on his own.

He reportedly suffered from 'worrying dips in heart rate and respiration,' according to the CBC, and staff in wetsuits spent the night with him in the water, keeping him afloat.

Today, however, head veterinarian, Dr Martin Haulena, is happy to report that Chester is doing well.

The calf, who was found stranded in July, initially could not swim on his own during the first night

Since then, the oceanic dolphin has been in Dr Martin Haulena's care at the Vancouver Aquarium

‘We have official permission from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to move Chester to our larger research pool that is located at our facility at the Vancouver Aquarium,' said Dr Haulena in a video released by the aquarium.

'It’s just time to do that. Chester has regained a lot of strength. He’s becoming quite a great swimmer. 

'He needs a bit more room. He also needs a habitat that we can control the temperature a little bit better now that it’s winter time.’

For the transport itself, several staff members got into the water with Chester to move him to the crane-assisted device.

For winter, however, staff had to move the large-toothed whale to a different temperature-regulated pool

'Sometimes [transport] can be a bit tricky, but we have a lot of great experienced staff who had done this with a lot of different animals,' Dr Haulena said.

And indeed the move was successful.

'Chester did really well,' the veterinarian said. 'It was a really short transport but he did very, very well.'

'A little bit concerning just with the amount of time he was spending under water – it looked like he was a little bit nervous about the new surroundings so it took him a little while to come up for that first breath. 

'But he’s kind of exploring. 

'He’s not using the whole pool yet and I think this is kind of a new thing for him as well. Lots of new noises and sights to be seen, so it’s just going to take a little while for him to acclimate and get used to what’s happening.'

The move, though a bit tricky, went off without a hitch - with Chester hesitantly exploring his new home

False killer whales, which are cetaceans, historically have a very low chance of survival if they become stranded. 

'It's always touch and go with young marine mammals who have become separated from their mothers and rescuing a false killer whale is a new experience for us,' Dr Haulena said.

'Very few veterinarians and other professionals around the world have experience rehabilitating stranded false killer whale calves.'
