Six children were left without a father after a cold-blooded execution-style shooting in Melbourne's southwest.

The 39-year-old man, reported to be a father of six, was shot numerous times while sitting in a car in his mother's Altona Meadows driveway at about 2am on Sunday.

The Herald Sun reports that the man was known on Facebook under the nickname Karl Kay. He died shortly after paramedics arrived at the scene.

Homicide Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon said while no eyewitnesses to the shooting had come forward, neighbours reported hearing screeching tyres soon after shots were fired.

“He received emergency treatment but unfortunately died at the scene,” he said.

Police believe the attack was targeted and confirmed the victim was known to police.

The man's mother and several other family members who were in the house at the time are assisting police with their investigation, Detective Solomon says.

Homicide detectives and Critical Incident Response police cordoned off Altona Meadows and the Lewin Court area.

Ballistics experts combed the man's silver sedan for forensic evidence, as dozens of family and friends arrived at the house.

No one has been arrested over the shooting. Police refused to comment on whether the incident was gang-related.

Friends paid tribute to the man on Facebook.

‘May God bless you. Oh God, Amen,’ said friend Abo Issam.

The man’s mother, who was ‘extremely traumatised’, was taken to a local police station to help detectives with their ­investigation.

Neighbours told The Herald Sun they still felt safe despite the shooting.

‘I don’t know how to take it. It’s a little bit daunting, especially when you’ve got young children. I don’t think we’re in any harm. It’s a vendetta I believe,’ one father said.

Another neighbour said: ‘They have their parties and late-night gatherings but never any trouble. They seem friendly enough.’
