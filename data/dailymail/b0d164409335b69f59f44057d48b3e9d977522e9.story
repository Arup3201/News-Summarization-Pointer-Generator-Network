Former DJ: Ray Teret (above) arrives at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court yesterday

A woman who claims Jimmy Savile raped her after a disco in the 1960s told a court yesterday how she cut her hair short afterwards because of her disgust that he had touched it.

Savile commented on the 15-year-old’s ‘lovely’ hair and started to ‘stroke’ it after fellow DJ Ray Teret had taken her to a flat, a court heard.

But before the teenager had the chance to explain that she had straightened it by ironing it with brown paper, Savile raped her, she told police more than 50 years later.

She alleged that she was also raped by Teret, now 73 and on trial for a series of sex offences, after which she claims he told her ‘you should be thanking us’ for taking her virginity.

Now in her 60s, she told his trial that she had short hair in a photograph taken a few weeks later because of what Savile had done. ‘I cut it off because he touched it,’ she told the jury.

The next day she told her grandmother, who tried to track down the two DJs, she said. The woman found Teret at a club and ‘battered’ him, afterwards apparently telling her granddaughter: ‘He won’t be doing that to anyone else.’

Teret, who made his name on pirate station Radio Caroline and is on trial with two other men, is accused of attacking 17 young girls over 35 years.

Yesterday the jury at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester was played the police video interview of the woman who claims that in 1963 or 64 she met Teret at an alcohol-free disco in Salford. The DJ – then in his early-20s – claimed he was 17 and asked to take her home, she said.

Instead he drove her in his bubble car to a nearby flat where Savile – already a successful DJ – was waiting. ‘I couldn’t believe it,’ she said, thinking ‘Oh my God’ and that she couldn’t wait to tell her friends.

Savile gave her Lucozade and told her to sit on the bed, she told detectives, but after admiring her hair he abruptly pushed his hand up her skirt and raped her.

Afterwards, she said, Teret also raped her. He allegedly made a disparaging comment about her losing her virginity and gave her money to catch a bus home, but she threw it away.

Feeling what had happened was ‘my fault’, she kept quiet for more than 50 years, even after other women made similar allegations against Teret.

But seeing him on television leaving court brought it all back, she said, and she told her family, who contacted police.

Cross-examined by Nicholas Johnson, defending Teret, she denied that his client had not been involved, telling the barrister: ‘You wasn’t there. Nobody knew other than my gran and Ray Teret and Jimmy Savile.’

Earlier, a woman who claims Teret raped her when she was a 15 or 16-year-old in 1963 or 1964 told how the DJ used to ‘make eyes’ at her at a youth disco.

She arranged to meet him in Manchester one afternoon, expecting to be taken on a date, but instead he led her to a small room in a dingy building furnished with only a bed where he raped her, she said.

Terrified and much smaller than him, she felt unable to scream or resist, she said.

‘I just lay there like some kind of stupid fool and let him do what he wanted,’ she said.

She also came forward after seeing press coverage of Teret leaving court, describing her reaction as: ‘Oh my God, he’s still alive.’

Another woman, aged 15 at the time, told detectives she was taken from a disco to a flat by Teret (above)

Cross-examined by Mr Johnson, she said she first encountered him DJ-ing with Savile. ‘He was following him around like a shadow,’ she said.

Teret, of Altrincham, denies 34 sexual offences including 18 rapes. Alan Ledger, 63, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. William Harper, 66, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape.

The trial continues.

DJ accused of sexually abusing 17 girls 'followed Jimmy Savile around in his nightclub like a shadow'

Two other men are also on trial with Teret: William Harper, 65, denies one count of attempted rape

A former DJ accused of sexually abusing 17 girls across four decades followed Jimmy Savile around in his nightclub ‘like a shadow’, a court heard yesterday.

One of Ray Teret's alleged victims said she first met the defendant in the early 1960s when he was working at Jimmy Savile's Disc Club in the Higher Broughton area of Salford, Greater Manchester.

‘Eccentric’ Savile was the ‘star of the show’ but Teret, 72, of Altrincham, took top billing when she met him again at a club in Manchester city centre called Beat City.

She told detectives she was aged 15 or 16 when Teret arranged to meet her outside the club, a jury at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court was told.

He led her to a nearby flat, took her straight to a bedroom and then raped and sexually assaulted her, she alleges.

Speaking to police in a video interview played to the court she said she had no sexual experience at the time while Teret was ‘like some sort of celebrity’.

Describing the alleged incident, she said: ‘He was like on top of me, I was sort of squirming. I couldn't say I was saying no. I didn't know what he was doing. I just laid there like some sort of stupid fool.’

She said at one point he said to her: ‘I do things like this to special people.’

When asked by the interviewer why she had come forward to the police, she said: ‘It has been on my mind for a long time. It's always in the back of my mind.

‘When the Savile case cropped up I really did think to myself “why don't you get that Ray Teret up” because he is just as bad as him.’

She rang the police in October last year after seeing Teret on television after he had been already been charged with sexual offences.

‘I put the news on and I seen him,’ she said. ‘I thought “he is still alive, he just does not deserve a life, he has got his come-uppance now”.’

She said she would rather tell a stranger about her experience than her family, who she still has not told.

Giving evidence via videolink, she told Nicholas Johnson, defending Teret, that she had not seen anything ‘sexual going on’ at Savile's club in Higher Broughton which she visited two or three times and she thought was a teenage disco for under-16s.

Mr Johnson said to her: ‘Mr Savile was a bit of celebrity at the time, wasn't he?’ She replied: ‘He was like an eccentric I would have said. He was just a DJ at the time.’

The woman said at first she was 'excited' and 'could not wait' to tell her friend that she had met Savile (above)

The barrister asked her: ‘Mr Teret, you saw him at the Jimmy Savile Disc Club?’ The witness said: ‘Yes.’ Mr Johnson continued: ‘He was not the star of the show at that stage.’

The witness replied: ‘No, it was Jimmy Savile.’ Mr Johnson said: ‘He, in effect, was helping Jimmy Savile?’

The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, replied: ‘He was following him around like a shadow.’

She said she ‘instantly recognised’ Teret when she saw him at Beat City, formerly known as The Three Fountains, in 1963 or 1964.

Mr Johnson asked: ‘How did you know his name?’ She replied: ‘It was posted on the bill on the door outside.’

The witness explained she could not remember when Teret asked to meet her outside Beat City one afternoon but she said she did not tell her friends. She said: ‘It was like a secret. He said "don't tell anybody".’

Mr Johnson said: ‘Are you suggesting that he swore you to secrecy?’ 

The witness said: ‘I am not suggesting that. He said "don't tell your friends" and I didn't.’

Mr Johnson asked: ‘Why not?’ She said: ‘Well I didn't want to tell anybody.’ 

Mr Johnson said: ‘What did you think you were meeting him for?’ She said: ‘To go on a date.’

‘What were you expecting to happen on the date?’ asked the barrister. The woman said: ‘Go for a coffee, go to the cinema but that never happened.’

Mr Johnson said: ‘The fact is that none of the events you describe did happen?’ 

She replied: ‘I'm not having that. It did happen. He did it. I have lived with it for 50 years. That is the truth and that is what happened.’

Mr Johnson said: ‘Why did you walk back to the club with him?’ 

She said: ‘Don't ask me. I don't know. I was like a zombie. I was so shocked at what he had done to me.’ 

Teret, who worked at pirate station Radio Caroline and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, denies 18 rapes, two other serious sexual assaults, one attempted rape, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child.

Two other men are also on trial with Teret. Alan Ledger, 62, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. William Harper, 65, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape.

The trial continues.
