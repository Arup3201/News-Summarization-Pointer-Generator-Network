These included cognitive behaviour therapy, anxiety management and art and play therapy, with the youngest of those aged just two.

Barbara Inkson, child clinical psychology at Solent NHS Trust, said: 'Levels of emotional disorders, including depression as well as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders, are rising.'

She said they were seeing an annual increase of about 10 per cent in referrals.

Meanwhile, the NHS Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service in Sussex estimated it was working with about 330 under-11s and 830 12 to 18-year-olds with anxiety and/or depression.

Experts said children are coming under increasing stress because of unemployment, financial problems and substance abuse among their parents.

Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds, said: 'Intervening early when a child or young person starts struggling to cope is proven to reduce the likelihood of that young person developing much more severe and entrenched mental health problems.

'It is vital that we invest in children and young people’s mental health in order to prevent a generation of children suffering entrenched mental health problems as adults.'

In February, MPs announced an extra £22million will be set aside to tackle child mental health treatment.

Nationally, one in ten children aged between five and 16 years old has a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.

Half of adults with long-term mental health problems will have experienced their first symptoms before the age of 14.
