Channel 4  launched a new set of diversity targets which could see executives lose bonuses if these are not met, after Lenny Henry inspired the debate by criticising representation of BAME groups

Bosses at Channel 4 could see their bonuses cut if they fail to meet new diversity targets, aimed at getting more women and people from ethnic minority groups onto screens and working in television. 

Under the measures six per cent of the workforce, on and off screen, will be lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender while 20 per cent of workers will be from ethnic minority groups in the next five years. 

Comedian Lenny Henry is said to have 'turbocharged' the debate and inspired Channel 4 to launch the charter after he launched a scathing attack on the industry for failing to improve representation of black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups on and off screen.

The targets have been designed to improve the representation of people from minority communities as well as the disabled and have been backed by more investment - which has been doubled to £5million. 

It will mean 50 per cent of the lead roles in television shows will have to be taken by females, while 15 per cent of guests and presenters in entertainment programmes will have to be from a minority sector such as BAME or disabled. 

Drama and comedies will need to feature at least one lead character who is disabled or from a BAME or LGBT group.  

Failure to meet the self imposed targets will mean top executives could see their bonuses cut, in line with the new measures that stipulate meeting targets 'is linked to annual variable pay.' 

David Abraham, the Channel 4 chief executive who could lose up to 30 per cent of his salary if he fails to meet the targets, said: 'It will be a black mark against that person.'

Comedian Lenny Henry last year attacked broadcasters during the BAFTA lecture for failing to represent minority groups both in programmes and behind the scenes. 

Mr Abraham said Henry had 'definitely turbocharged the discussion … he has drawn attention to some very specific issues which I think are important and have formed part of the initiative today.' 

He added: 'We have a rich heritage in pioneering programming that has reshaped how we think about diversity from Desmond's and Queer as Folk through to the 2012 Paralympics, but like all media organisations, there is more we can do.

'The launch of our 360° Charter is an opportunity for us to change how we think about diversity and ensure that it's at the very heart of everything that we do, on and off-screen

Channel four has pledged £5million of funding to ensure it meets the new diversity targets it has set

The diversity charter was drawn up by Oona King, diversity executive at Channel 4, after it was revealed that fewer people from BAME backgrounds were now working in television compared to five years ago.

She said the broadcaster was not looking to hire people purely because they were black or from a minority group but told the Guardian that Channel 4  needed to 'look harder for people who are talented, from those groups. Sometimes it is hard to find people'.

Ms King said the targets would be difficult to achieve and said previous attempts had not been transparent enough or backed by enough funding.  

* The top 120 leaders meet the national averages for BAME (15 per cent), gender (50:50), disability (6 per cent) and LGBT (6 per cent) representation by 2020.

* All staff will also share the same targets with a higher target for BAME representation (20 per cent) reflecting the greater ethnic diversity of the workforce in London around Channel 4's main headquarters.

* Funding for seven diverse Deputy Commissioning Editors over two years. 

* Investing in a new generation of on and off-screen disabled talent for Rio 2016.  Channel 4 will recruit 30 production trainees with disabilities who will be given extensive training  and, alongside two new disabled presenters, will work on broadcast of the Rio 2016 Paralympics.

* Leadership objective setting and incentivisation to ensure that all Channel 4's senior managers and editorial staff have specific and measurable diversity objectives and that their success in meeting them is linked to annual variable pay.

* Investing in indies led by BAME entrepreneurs and those from other diverse backgrounds with the Channel 4 Growth Fund.
