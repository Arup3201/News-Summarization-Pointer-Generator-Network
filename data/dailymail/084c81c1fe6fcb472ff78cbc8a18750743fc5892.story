Roy Hodgson believes England are a match for world champions Germany, despite the Three Lions' woeful display at the World Cup.

England endured their worst World Cup ever, failing to make it out of their group and left Brazil embarrassed and without a win.

But Hodgson believes there is very little to separate his England flops with the German team who left after clinching the ultimate prize.

He told Sky Sports: 'I don't believe in the nonsense spoken about the identity of certain countries and how they play. I don't see the vast amount of difference between how we try and the way Germany try to play.

'Now there is a major difference between the 11 players in the German shirt and the 11 players in the England shirt. But if we are talking about how they attack and build up their attacks, or how they keep possession and seek for openings when they have got the ball, I don't see a vast amount of difference in philosophy or style. 

'And the same defensively. I don't see what they are trying to do to keep compact to put pressure on the ball, to try and keep the team united close together, to block crosses. I don't see the great difference in philosophy there either.

'If ever you want to know about the small margins in football and the fact that it is anything other than an exact science, that random things that happen in the game makes all the difference, I could give you six or seven examples from the World Cup that made winners into losers and vice-versa.' 

Hodgson never considered quitting in the wake of England's disappointing campaign. 

He was immediately backed by FA chairman Greg Dyke and is now back in office planning for the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

'There have been plenty of dark moments, times where looking back you don't believe fate has put you in that situation,' he added.

'But the fact is that I would quite happily relinquish this job any time my employers think they don't want me any more, or when I feel the players don't have the respect necessary or feel they don't want to continue playing for me. In that moment if it's time for me to walk away I will do, but this time it was made clear to me that wasn't the situation.

'The FA wanted me to continue in the job, the feedback from the people around the team was the same, therefore there was never any doubt in my mind that I would continue.' 

Prices for England’s next game against Norway at Wembley are priced at £30,£40,£50 and £60. Family enclosure tickets are priced at £20 and £10 for U16's. There is a large family enclosure for this match and over half of the tickets sold will be under£30 if demand dictates. If you can get this in I’d be grateful.
