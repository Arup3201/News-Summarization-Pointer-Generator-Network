A wide-eyed Prince George got to meet Father Christmas at the weekend during a surprise family visit to a winter wonderland.

The 17-month-old future king clapped his hands in excitement as he toured Santa’s Magical Journey at Thursford, close to the family’s new country home in Norfolk with his parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 

Members of the public couldn’t believe their eyes as the royal party, who had booked their tickets (£15 for children and £9.50 for adults) in advance, toured the popular attraction with a discreet coterie of bodyguards.

Christmas outing: The 17-month-old future king clapped his hands in excitement as he toured Santa’s Magical Journey at Thursford today

The young prince gazed in awe at animated reindeer, penguins, polar bears and elves set among twinkling lights, tinsel and fake snow during his hour long visit.

He also got to see real life elves hard at work making toys in Santa’s workshop and met giant-sized teddy bears preparing to load presents into his sleigh for delivery on Christmas Eve.

The highlight of his festive treat, however, was when he summoned up the courage to toddle through a magical forest and go into Father Christmas’s house so he could meet the great man himself.

George had the chance to chat to Father Christmas while William and Kate stood beside him and was given a gift-wrapped wooden train as a present – an ideal present for the youngster who loves his ‘choo choos’.

Staff were only told that they were getting an unofficial Royal visit shortly before their arrival with other members of the Middleton family.

William and Kate, who is pregnant with her second child, were given a standard timed slot on arrival and queued patiently with other parents.

General manager, Geraldine Rye, said: ‘George seemed to have a lovely time. When I saw him, he was walking around.

‘It was a private visit and they were not given any special treatment. We only knew shortly beforehand that they were coming.

‘They went around the winding path in our exhibition centre and would have seen animated animals like polar bears, penguins and reindeers as well as elves and snowmen.

‘It is a fantasy land and the animated elves tell stories which you can listen to as you go round. It is all very traditional and is designed for families with young children.

‘They would also have seen Santa’s workshop before going to Father Christmas’s house. There were lots of different things for them to see and they were treated just like everyone else.

‘The visit including going into Santa’s house usually takes at least 45 minutes, but they seemed to be here a long time. They didn’t miss anything and they had a good time.

‘Lots of people recognised them, but they didn’t get any hassle and nobody tried to take any pictures of them.”

Miss Rye added: ‘Father Christmas speaks to the children who stand in front of him with their parents. The only other person in the room is an elf who sorts out the presents.

‘What he says to them and their parents is private. Only Father Christmas and his elf know what has been said.

‘The children are given different gifts according to their age and George would have got a wooden train just like other boys who are his age.’

Royal invitation: Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, William and Kate are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for Michael, Carole, James and Pippa

Sources have told the Mail that William, Kate and George – as well as the rest of the Middleton family – arrived in Norfolk on Thursday for what has been described as a ‘perfect family Christmas’.

Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, situated on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, William and Kate are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for Michael, Carole, James and Pippa.

The house, which boasts its own swimming pool and tennis court, was a wedding gift from the Queen and has recently undergone a multi-million pound refit.

It is just a short drive from her private country residence, Sandringham House, where the rest of the Royal Family are congregating for their annual holiday.

Now that Kate’s family has joined the extended gathering for the first time, the question remains: will they be invited to join the Queen at church on Christmas Day or one of the daily hunting parties enjoyed by the royals over the festive season, including the coveted Boxing Day pheasant shoot?

‘The Duchess has long been keen to host big family Christmas in her new home, the kind of Christmas she enjoyed as a girl, and most of the Middletons duly arrived on Thursday afternoon,’ the source revealed.

‘It’s not clear yet whether the Duchess’s family have been invited to join the Queen, but it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see them walking to Church on Christmas Day and even join everyone for lunch before returning to Anmer in the evening.

‘It will be quite a turn up for books if they do, but the Queen doesn’t do anything by the book when it comes to William’s new family.’

Aides say that the Duke and Duchess will joined the Queen for church on Christmas morning without their toddler son.
