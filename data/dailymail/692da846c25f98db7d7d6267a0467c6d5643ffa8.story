A Supreme Court Judge has ruled a the boyfriend a murder victim is the prime suspect in an eminent cold case from nine years ago.

Simone Strobel, a 25-year-old German kindergarten teacher, disappeared from a tourist park in Lismore, Northern NSW, on February the 11th  2005. Her naked body was found hidden under a palm tree one week later.

She was found to have been suffocated with a pillow or a plastic bag. Despite substantial investigations, the case remains unsolved.

Simone Strobel's body was found hidden at a camp site in 2005. Forensic investigations found she had been suffocated with a pillow or plastic bag

In June, Moran  filed for an injunction to stop Schwartz Publishing Pty Ltd releasing a book, Have You Seen Simone?, by author Virginia Peters, on the grounds that it 'seriously defamed him'. 

The case was handled by West Australian Supreme Court Judge Kennet Martin, who this week has published his rejection of the order. Martin has said there is 'reasonable suspicion' that Strobel's boyfriend at the time, Tobias Moran-formerly Tobias Suckfuell-was behind her death.

 Yahoo News reported that Martin said: 'The proximity of Simone's discovered body (within 90m of the Lismore caravan park), the plaintiff's (Suckfuell/Moran) lack of a solid alibi in terms of his overall movements on the evening before Simone left, some arguably odd behaviour by him in terms of him not searching for Simone the next morning (he denies that) and some delay in reporting Simone's disappearance to the Australian police, this goes towards providing a basis for a reasonable suspicion about the plaintiff.

'Suspicion must inevitably fall upon this plaintiff as regards this unsolved crime'.

Strobel's body was found 90 metres from where she was staying with Moran in a Lismore Caravan park. A new hearing shows they had been arguing heavily on the night of her disappearance 

The hearing also showed that Moran has misled the investigation. Strobel and Moran had been arguing  in the days leading up to her disappearance. They were also drinking heavily on the night of her disappearance, and had returned to the camping they were staying at site to smoke marijuana.

Martin said that these details were denied by Moran, hereby misleading the investigation.

However, he ruled that 'there is no forensic evidence at this point supporting a conclusion that the plaintiff was her murderer.'

Earlier this year, German authorities have offered a $15,000 reward for information about her death.
