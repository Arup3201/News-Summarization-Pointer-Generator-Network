A New York prison officer with 16 inch biceps has been crowned a champion arm wrestler while working in one of America's most notorious jails.

Vinny Vetere, 46, has claimed multiple state and international arm wrestling titles while working his day job as a correctional officer at Rikers Island, home to more than 12,000 inmates.

Officers at the city's Department of Correction maintain order and discipline at the facility and are in charge of the care, custody and control of inmates.

Mr Vetere, from Long Island, New York, initially began arm wrestling competitively as a way to keep his strength up for riot situations and other disorder while he was at work.

But after a superior invited him to represent the department at the New York State Police Olympics he jumped at the chance - and even went on to compete internationally.

He has ruthlessly swept opponents aside scooping four New York State Police Olympic titles, one International Law Enforcement Games title and one Empire State title - the latter open to all New Yorkers instead of just law enforcement.

Vinny, who is 5'8" weighs 198lbs (14 stone) and has 16 inch biceps is now gearing up to compete in the 37th Big Apple Grapple International Championships on Sunday.

He said: 'I compete to win and I compete to go to work - I need to be in good shape as my life is on the line as well as my partners life being on the line.

'I have to look out for him and he has to look out for me so we can't be going in half-hearted otherwise somebody is going to get hurt.

'Each day a correction officer is given a housing area of between 50 to 100 inmates and we have to patrol that area, check the bathrooms and day rooms to make sure they are all secure and nobody is out of control.

'One day it can be really quiet and the next there might be an outbreak - so being prepared is vital.

'Through work I was trained in martial arts. I was given top notch training from black belts whether it be stood up or on the ground - it was the best of the best.

'At home I still do a lot of cardio and will sometimes spend a whole day lifting weights and working with other arm wrestlers. Some days I can't even lift my arm - so I make sure I don't have to go to work that day.

'I compete to go against the strongest guy - I want to beat the best guy out there. Being in competitions against these huge guys with my heart booming and people cheering us on is such a thrill.'

What started off as playground fun for Vinny - a member of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association - soon grew into a passion.

One of Mr Vetere's first encounters of arm wrestline came when he was invited to take on a local champion in a classic showdown under a bridge.

He lost within seconds in front of crowds of school friends but was taken under the wing of his opponent who trained him up and taught him techniques so he could beat people bigger than him.

He added: 'I was taught these pretty advanced techniques from a young age so I had time to practice them - I used to be smaller so trained extra hard to beat all these huge guys.

'I took a couple of years out now and then throughout my career but every time I couldn't wait to get back. I'm still unbeaten against law enforcement but I know I won't be able to go on forever - but that won't stop me trying.'
