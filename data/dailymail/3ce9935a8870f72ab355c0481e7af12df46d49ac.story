Almost a hundred years after Australians and New Zealanders led the charge in their bloodiest battle on foreign soil, tens of thousands have gathered at various places around the two countries to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice at Gallipoli in 1915.

Despite the failure to achieve military objectives on that fateful day 99 years ago, April 25 has since become a date when Australian and New Zealanders remember those who died in battle.

The huge Turkish losses are also remembered by thousands of soldiers who traveled to Gallipoli, with all countries involved paying their respects despite their fierce enmity almost a century ago.

Services were held at dawn in both Australia and New Zealand - at the time of the original 1915 landing. Ex-servicemen and women then carry out marches later in the day in Australia and New Zealand.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also made an unannounced surprise appearance at an Anzac Day service outside the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, marking the end of their three-week tour Down Under.

Special services were also held all over Sydney and Melbourne, as well as on the Gold Coast -  where members of the Mudgeeraba light horse troop took part at Currumbin Surf Life Saving Club.

Many also took the opportunity to lay remembrance wreaths at their respective services, while others pinned poppy flowers alongside the names of those lost in battle.

Over in Christchurch, New Zealand, returned servicemen and their relatives marched in Cranmer Square - a tradition that has occurred annually since World War I.

Veterans adorned with medals also paid their respects and remembered their comrades with notes, flowers and special, sentimental objects as well.

Over the course of the eight-month campaign 11,500 troops were killed and some 86,000 Turkish troops are reported to have died

In 1915, under British orders, troops from Australia and New Zealand embarked on an allied expedition to capture the Gallipoli peninsula.

By colonising the peninsula it was hoped that Anzacs would open up to the waters up to the allied naval forces. From there, troops aimed to conquer Constantinople, now Istanbul.

But from the time the first boats landed before dawn on April 25, it was clear the campaign would be a catastrophic failure. Over the course of the eight-month mission, 11,500 troops died for precious little gain. Some 86,000 Turkish troops are reported to have been killed during the conflict.
