Police came under fire last night for responding to an insulting tweet from provocative TV personality Katie Hopkins about Pauline Cafferkey.

They said they were investigating posts by the former Apprentice contestant which called the nurse a ‘sweaty Glaswegian’ and referred to Scots as ‘Jocks’.

Police Scotland confirmed they were looking into complaints about the tweets, which numbered in the ‘hundreds’.

However, critics including Ukip leader Nigel Farage last night branded the investigation a ‘waste of police time’.

Detective Inspector Glyn Roberts, of Police Scotland, said: ‘We have received a number of complaints regarding remarks made on Twitter.

‘Inquiries are ongoing into the nature of these tweets and to establish any potential criminality. Police Scotland will thoroughly investigate any reports of offensive or criminal behaviour online and anyone found to be responsible will be robustly dealt with.’

Offensive: This week Hopkins called the Scottish 'sweaty little jocks, which has caused uproar

Television personality Katie Hopkins provoked outrage after she made jibes about Scottish independence after she learnt that a patient with Ebola had been moved from Glasgow to London for treatment

Outrage: More than 12,000 people have signed a petition demanding Katie Hopkins is arrested 

As Miss Cafferkey was being transferred from her home to a hospital in London, Hopkins took the opportunity to poke fun at those who support Scottish independence.

She wrote: ‘Glaswegian ebola patient moved to London’s Royal Free Hospital. Not so independent when it matters most are we jocksville?’

She added: ‘Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn’t cricket.’ Her remarks caused outrage on Twitter, with many accusing her of racism, while journalist Piers Morgan branded her a ‘repulsive creature’.

Last night an online petition to see her charged by police had been backed by more than 17,500 people.

Katie Hopkins has been accused of committing a hate crime against fat people. The TV star was reported to police by plus size campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki (right) during filming for Katie's new documentary.

But the decision of Police Scotland to step in has raised concern that officers should be dealing with genuine crime rather than Twitter spats.

Last night, Mr Farage said: ‘There’s no need for police intervention, it’s a terrible waste of police time.

‘If [Katie Hopkins] wants to behave like that then the public can judge her. There will always be people who will be rude about others, but it’s not a police matter.’

Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Miss Hopkins’ tweet was insensitive, tasteless and not particularly amusing, but for a whole number of reasons it’s not the sort of thing the police should be dealing with.

‘We’re embarking on an extraordinarily dangerous and slippery slope if we start investigating people for being “offensive”.’

Police forces have reported a massive rise in social media-related complaints, with many struggling to cope with the extra workload.

In cockney rhyming slang, 'Sweaty Sock' means Jock - a Scotsman.

Jock is a slightly pejorative term meaning a Scottish person.

The term has led to the abbreviated derogatory term 'Sweaties'.

In 2011 Mark Lynch, originally from Glasgow, said he was called 'sweaty sock, Scottish b*****d, Jock and Scottie' at the Cornish abbatoir where he worked  and sued his employer for racial discrimination.

He lost the racism claim at an employment tribunal. 

Almost 20,000 adults were investigated in the past three years for online comments, the equivalent of almost 20 each day, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

In addition more than 2,000 children – some as young as nine – have been investigated for social media messages.

In light of the rising number of complaints, the Crown Prosecution Service issued new guidance last year in an attempt to clarify the law on criminal online postings.

Prosecutors were advised to look out for messages that constituted a ‘credible threat of violence to the person or damage to property’.

In 2010, Paul Chambers was investigated and charged for a tweet in which he joked that he would blow Robin Hood airport ‘sky high’. He was convicted, but the conviction was quashed in 2012, after a judge deemed that his message was not intended to be menacing.

Miss Hopkins has herself complained of threats of rape and violence online.

The Sun newspaper columnist, who has deliberately courted controversy with attacks on the parents of Madeleine McCann, once said: ‘Being threatened with rape and violence are nothing new to me on Twitter. I have been choosing to ignore trolls for months.

‘They threaten me, my children and my home. I certainly don’t think it is a problem for the police.’
