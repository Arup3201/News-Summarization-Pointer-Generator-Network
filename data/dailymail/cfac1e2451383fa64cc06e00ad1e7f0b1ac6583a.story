Royal baby: The arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge's baby, which is due next month, is expected to spark a spending boom

The nation will spend millions celebrating the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child in July, experts have predicted.

Britons are expected to spend £243million on memorabilia, champagne and food for parties.

And the palace is likely to benefit from the birth - with a range of royal-themed baby clothes and gifts already available in its online shops.

Guardsman sleepsuits for babies and princess t-shirts for girls are being sold on the Royal Collection Trust website for £12.95.

There are also princess cushions for £45 and plastic dolls for £5.95.

While Prince Charles's Highgrove shop is selling Union Flag and tractor-themed leather baby shoes for £22.50 and children's flatcaps for £40.

The Buckingham Palace shop is planning to release an official range in honour of the baby, but not until after the birth.

Money raised from the online shops is invested in maintaining the royal estates and art collections.

High street chains will also cash in on the birth. Mothercare has announced a new range
of romper suits and baby grows and the chain is also planning a pram in
the design of a royal horse-drawn carriage.

And Kate's parents' party accessories business Party Pieces has also launched a 'baby arrival' range.

Retail experts say 4.8million people will spend £62million toasting the arrival of the Royal baby with three million bottles of champagne or sparkling wine.

Around £25million will be spent on party food by those marking the occasion.

The public will spend £56million on commemorative memorabilia, £76million on books, DVDs and media and £24million on toys at the time of the birth.

And the 'Kate effect' which has seen dresses worn by the Duchess to fly off the shelves is likely to inspire parents to splash out on the pram or pushchair she buys - rumoured to be a blue Bugaboo - causing sales to increase by 13 per cent.

Royal events have traditionally led to sales boosts, with the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge causing sales to rise by 6.9 per cent compared to the previous year and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee seeing spending up 3.5 per cent, according to the KPMG monitor.

Expecting: The Duchess makes a joke with Camilla and Harry during her last public appearance before the birth

Shopping: The Duchess has been spotted browsing for nursery supplies. It is expected parents will copy her style and snap up the same baby equipment

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of 
the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'It is no great surprise that this type of
feel good event provides retailers with a welcome boost as consumer 
hype generates additional spending.

'However, much of this can be 
attributed to retailers increased marketing and advertising activity 
around the time of the event, quite rightly securing their share of the 
spending frenzy.

'These are difficult times for retailers and every 
catalyst for increased sales should be utilised as this will bring the 
economic recovery one step closer.'

He added: 'One of the biggest factors will be 
the unintentional royal brand endorsement. The carriage of choice for 
the royal arrival will no doubt become this year’s best selling pram for
new and existing parents.

'The
‘Kate effect’ has already taken the fashion world by storm with each of
her choices flying off the shelves within moments of her leaving the 
house. This trend will follow for the infant’s babygrows, rattles, first
bike and so on.

'It’s a
culture of ‘keeping up with the Cambridges’ that isn’t going away, 
albeit a very profitable culture for the retail sector.'

Boost: The Royal Wedding in April 2011 caused high street sales to rise by 6.9 per cent compared to the previous year
