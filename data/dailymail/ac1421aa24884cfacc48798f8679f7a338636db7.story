Cameron Jerome has become the third striker to join Norwich this summer after moving from Stoke for an undisclosed fee.

After the acquisitions of Lewis Grabban and Kyle Lafferty, Jerome has further bolstered Neil Adams' attacking options by signing a three-year deal.

No-brainer: Striker Cameron Jerone hopes to revive his career with Norwich move

It was a busy day for the Canaries in the transfer market with Leroy Fer moving to QPR for a club-record fee while free agent defender Carlos Cuellar was brought in and Michael Turner signed a new deal.

't's a massive club and from my point of view, where I am in my career, I just need to be playing regularly and Norwich have made me feel very welcome,' Jerome said.

'Once I spoke with the manager and a few other people here it was a no-brainer. The ambition of the club matches my ambition as a player and I'm looking forward to getting stuck into training and hopefully being involved at the weekend.'

Jerome made 30 appearances in the Barclays Premier League last season but only one of them came for Stoke as he spent the majority of the campaign at Tony Pulis' Crystal Palace.

The former Birmingham and Cardiff striker, 27, scored just twice while with the Eagles, though.

Adams added: 'He's someone I've been looking at for a long while and I'm delighted he became available to us. He gives us that brute strength as well as power, but he's got much more than that too.

'He works really hard for the team and he gives us that strength in depth that we'll need over a tough season.'
