Lord Lucan was smuggled out of Britain to a remote Greek monastery by a former MI5 agent financed by his wealthy friends, a new book has sensationally claimed.

The nation's most wanted criminal was rescued by an exclusive group of Britain's richest socialites who enlisted a right-wing private army of former Government agents.

In the week following the brutal murder of nanny Sandra Rivett in 1974, Lucan was moved around the country from a hotel to a pub and on to a ramshackle safe house.

Lord Lucan escaped to a remote Greek monastery thanks to a shadowy cabal of ex-spies after his children's nanny was killed, claims a new book. Lady Lucan (right) is believed to have been the murder suspect's intended target

Solitude: The Monastery of Kapsa in Crete, where the aristocrat is said to have hidden out

The fugitive - hunted by the nation's police - shaved off his moustache, applied some fake tan and bleached his hair before boarding a flight from Heathrow with a fake passport provided by the former spy.

The duo hid out in remote safe houses and fishing boats in Greece, before Lucan made it to the virtually inaccessible Cliffside monastery in Crete.

After hiding out there for weeks, he disappeared on a boat to the shores of Africa under the guise of a monk, never to be seen again.

The astonishing theory has been put forward by author Richard Wilmott who claims to have solved the 40-year mystery of what happened to the missing peer.

Victim: Sandra Rivett, who was bludgeoned to death in the home of Lord Lucan's wife

He said his findings are the result of more than 20 years' research - during which his car containing some of his work was unaccountably torched.

He claims his discoveries have been confirmed by a member of the Lucan family and says he only feels safe to reveal them now that key players in the plot have died.

Mr Wilmott said: 'Everyone thought it was his wealthy chums that spirited him away but it is just not possible to simply disappear without a trace.

'Normal people, even those over-burdened with wealth, lack the ability to pull off such a trick. It takes the hands of professionals to disappear completely for 40 years. And that's what he had.'

The writer says his story comes from a former MI5 agent known as James Gurney who claims he was the man responsible for escorting Lucan out of Britain.

He said Gurney showed him his diaries to back up his extraordinary tale.

Lucan was part of the Clermont Set, an exclusive group of Britain's richest gamblers and socialites who met at the Clermont Club in London's Mayfair.

According to Gurney, they were the ones who enlisted a right-wing 'private army' known as the Troops of Midian to make Lucan disappear.

They were a clandestine freelance outfit of former Government agents who carried out black ops work for MI5 and MI6 and even the CIA.

Ms Rivett, 29, was bludgeoned to death in the basement kitchen of a four-storey house in Lower Belgrave Street, central London, in what police believed was a case of mistaken identity.

Lord Lucan had lost a bitter custody battle with his wife Veronica. He had taken to spying on his estranged wife and his children, and lived just 100 yards away.

Mr Wilmott says in the week following the murder Lucan was taken to the Wellington Hotel in Tunbridge Wells and then on to the Crown Inn, Groombridge, where he was handed over to Gurney.

Detailed in diary entries from the time, he took him to a ramshackle safe house - once used by the intelligence agencies - in the tiny Wiltshire village of Fonthill Gifford.

'He was then spirited out of the country and this guy Gurney was with him all the way,' said Mr Wilmott.

'He was being paid by the Clermont Set to work for the Troops of Midian who were dangerous characters.

'They were in the business of taking people out if things go wrong. You didn't want to upset people like that.

'It was being bank-rolled by Lucan's chums, the Troops of Midian who were professionals involved purely on a cash basis, purely for the money.'

Lucan shaved off his moustache, applied fake tan, bleached his hair and left the Wiltshire cottage carrying a fake passport in the name of Richard Bishop.

He then simply strolled through Heathrow Airport with Gurney and boarded a plane to Athens.

Gurney's diary said: 'It might have seemed lunacy that I was about to set out in broad daylight with the most wanted man in Britain beside me, but the police were looking for a lone man, with dark hair and a sandy speckled moustache.

'We were two fair, clean shaven men, travelling together.'

Wilmott added: 'Lucan looked a lot older than the photographs put out, which were taken ten years before.

'He had become depressed and was no longer quite the dashing guy of all the photographs. He had lost his hair a little and was slightly podgier too, due to the drink.

'He had a fake passport - the Troops of Midian got him that - it was an easier thing to do.'

Less than a fortnight after the murder and attempted murder of his wife Lucan, public enemy number one, was on a plane to Athens.

In Greece Gurney said he met agents who helped him hide the fugitive in various safe houses and fishing boats before he ended at the remote Moni Kapsa monastery in Crete.

Carved into the hill at the end of the Pervolakia Gorge and overlooking the Libyan Sea, it was virtually inaccessible - and a perfect hiding place.

Wilmott, who visited the spot several times during his research, said: 'Lucan was left down there for the best part of a month.

'The monastery was a bit of a foreign legion. If life got too much for you, you could just go there and become a working monk. Lucan would fit in. You could quite easily disappear.

'As long as you pitched in with what needed doing, chores, picking beans, you were very welcome.

'I went to interview people at the local taverna and they remember this tall, thin man coming down and playing backgammon with the locals.

'They said he would walk the mountains and they called him "the man that walked with the goats".'

A month after his arrival, Gurney met the tanned and much-fitter Lucan - the last time he ever saw him in the town of Irapetra.

He barely recognised the Lord and said in his diary that he looked ten years younger.

He wrote: 'Lucan looked fit and healthy and was smiling as he greeted me with a strong handshake.

'Gone was the irritable and irritating snob with the military bearing and sulky behaviour.

'He could have been ten years younger and without a worry in the world.'

Gurney waved goodbye to the earl an hour later and watched him leave on a small fishing boat probably destined to meet a bigger boat on the way to South Africa.

Admitting he has no evidence to back it up, Wilmott reckons Lucan went to Botswana - playing the role of a monk from Moni Kapsa when necessary.

He added: 'In Greece at the time, if you were connected to the monastery or religion, you were given pretty much free rein - you didn't even need a passport to travel.'

Richard discovered that the monastery received an anonymous donation of several thousands of pounds in 1975 - shortly after Lucan's stay.

It paid for much-needed repair work and a resident stipendiary priest.

There are numerous theories about the fate of Lord Lucan. One is that he killed himself after being consumed with guilt

Richard put his theories to a member of Lucan's family - via a friend at the BBC - who let slip over a drink that his research was 'spot on'.

The relative told his friend - who was interviewing him on a separate topic - that Lucan had died in 2004.

'After another couple of drinks the family member changed it to 2008, but on both times he said he died "in sanctuary", in a monastery or somewhere like that.

'The family member said that what information he had from us at the time was pretty much close to the truth.'

Richard said he knew he was really onto something when his car was mysteriously firebombed in 1995 outside his home in Bourton, Dorset.

All his notebooks and diaries that had been inside it were taken but Richard had kept copies.

He added: 'I knew then I was really on to something and getting too close for certain people.'

He was introduced to Gurney after a chance meeting in 1992 with an unnamed ex-lieutenant colonel and MI5 man who had started recording Gurney's story.

The lieutenant colonel passed on Gurney's research - and his details - when he was recalled to the intelligence services.

And although he met Gurney on a number of occasions - and corresponded via addresses in America and South Africa - Richard believes that was an alias and his real identity and whereabouts remain unknown.
