A studio assistant to artist David Hockney died after swallowing bleach during a drink and drugs session with the millionaire artist’s former partner, an inquest heard yesterday.

Dominic Elliott, 23, was in a relationship with Hockney’s ex John Fitzherbert and the pair ended up in bed together after their all-night session while the painter slept just down the corridor at his home.

Mr Fitzherbert, who is in his early 60s, told the inquest in Hull that after spending most of the day sleeping he was woken at 4am on Sunday March 17 by his young lover asking to be driven to hospital.

He said he found an open bottle of 
toilet cleaner – which was 95 per cent sulphuric acid – in the bathroom 
sink but ‘didn’t connect’ the two.

Mr
Elliott ‘slouched forward groaning and grunting’ during the 45-minute 
journey to Scarborough General Hospital but was pronounced dead soon 
after his arrival.

He would have died in agony and suffered shocking internal injuries, the inquest was told.

Mr
Hockney, one of Britain’s most successful artists and worth around 
£37million, did not attend the inquest but he submitted a statement.

He
described how he shared his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, with 
his ex-partner and two other male studio assistants, but had his own 
room where he slept alone.

Mr
Hockney said he knew Mr Elliott, who had his own home in the town, only
on a professional basis but described him as a ‘Jekyll and Hyde 
character’ when drunk.

Mr 
Hockney said he saw Mr Fitzherbert at midnight on the Saturday but 
noticed ‘nothing out the ordinary’. He said he knew nothing about 
drug-taking that night and was asleep when Mr Elliott was taken to 
hospital. He was woken by an assistant at 9.30am and told of his death.

Mr
Fitzherbert told the inquest that he had been Mr Hockney’s partner for 
24 years, but the pair split amicably four years ago. They remained 
friends and continued to share the five-bedroom house in Bridlington.

Mr
Elliott, who had a relationship with Mr Fitzherbert before he went to 
university, became an assistant for Mr Hockney after dropping out.

Mr
Fitzherbert said Mr Elliott came to see him on the Friday night before 
his death. He was upset about his exclusion from a Vanity Fair 
photoshoot of Mr Hockney and his team by the leading photographer Annie 
Leibovitz.

The two men spent
the night alone together in Mr Hockney’s house drinking and taking 
drugs, with Mr Elliott snorting cocaine. The following day they were in 
bed when they heard Mr Hockney leave the house. Mr Fitzherbert said Mr 
Elliott was ‘laughing hysterically’ and leapt out of bed before throwing
himself off an internal balcony.

Mr Elliott could not explain his behaviour but Mr Fitzherbert said he was ‘prone to random behaviour’ when drunk.

They smoked more cannabis but spent most of the day sleeping until Mr Elliott asked to go to hospital.

A post-mortem examination revealed cause of death to be ingestion of sulphuric acid ‘associated’ with taking drugs.

The
pathologist said Mr Elliott had a ‘significant quantity of ecstasy’ in 
his system and that would have ‘exerted influence at the time of death’.

The inquest continues.
