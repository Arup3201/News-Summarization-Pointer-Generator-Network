A mother of three from Manchester has turned down a writing scholarship so she can publish her first book - about her former double life as a high class call girl.

Rachael Webster, 41, had been offered a place on a prestigious creative writing degree at Ruskin College in Oxford after impressing academics with her skills as an author.

But she rejected the offer and instead has written a book lifting the lid on how she used to earn £3,000 a week offering sexual services to the rich and famous in London's West End.

During her former life as a high class escort named Sam she claims that she wore the best designer clothes, frequented the Ritz and Claridges and regularly shopped at high end ladies boutiques.

She eventually quit after she was struck down by a depressive illness sparked by the death of her mother Lyn from cancer aged just 63.

As part of her recovery Rachael, who left school without any qualifications, began penning her memoirs at an adult education centre.

Her imaginative writing skills led to her being offered a degree place at Ruskin which specialises in providing educational opportunities for adults with few or no qualifications.

Today Rachael said: 'I was so flattered but decided not to take the offer up because I wanted to start writing my own book there and then.

'I knew it was a gamble but it's paid off. It has been really therapeutic to get everything down on paper.

'It was quite tiring leading a double life, it wasn't always as glamorous as it seemed. It's not a line of work I'd want my daughter to go into but my life has been fascinating. And it certainly gave me a lot to write about.'

Rachael was a full time mother-of-one living in a council house when in 1994 she answered an advert in her local paper saying 'girls wanted' after reading about an escort in women's magazine.

Rachael would send a lot of the money back up to her mother, with whom she is pictured as a baby

For her first job she got £50 and she 
moved to London where she was earning up to £12,000 a month and 
regularly sending money back home to her her mother who was left to care
 for her small child.

Rachael said: 'For years I was basically living a double life, a part time high class call girl and a part time loving mother to my eldest daughter.

'In London I was very glamorous with my make-up perfectly done, my Jimmy Choo heels and Chanel bags but at home I had my hair tied back and my jeans and t-shirt on.

'I was just a girl that came from 
Manchester and yet I was living a life of luxury. I'd gone from having 
threadbare carpets in a council flat to earning £3,000 some weeks, it 
was incredible.

'To be able
 to buy my daughter the clothes and toys she'd always wanted was the 
best feeling in the world and it gave me a rush to know she could have 
anything she wanted.

'At the same time I often felt bad that I worked away a lot and watching her become closer with my mum than she was with me was hard.'

'I'd leave my daughter with my mum and I would go to London for a week or so to 'work' and then go back home again. In the end I did confess what I was doing to my mum but she said she'd already guessed.

'She was terrified thinking I was going to get hurt but that kind of thing never really bothered me. I was working for an agency and they would get clients for me. Sometimes people would ring up randomly asking for blondes or brunettes and other times they would ask for me.

'You were with people that have a lot of 
money and were pretty well known - but also people who were criminals 
and gangsters. My clients included a wealthy record producer who once 
asked me to marry him. Also the brother of a very famous actor and the 
son of a very well-known man.

'I also had gangsters ask for me so I
 had to have my wits about me. The money was great - I was earning 
thousands each week but the hardest part was knowing that  my daughter was 
missing out on me being her mum.

'I was partying really hard - sex, drugs, rock n roll. My life is very different from how it was.'

Rachael
 initially returned to Manchester and met a man, settling down and having two 
more children but returned to vice when they split up.

Then in 2010 her mother Lyn died from breast cancer and within a few months Rachael, who was heartbroken, suffered swelling of the brain and nearly died from an illness called Broken Heart Syndrome.

Rachael penning down her memoirs, called The First Floor and available on Amazon.co.uk, in 2011 and took a creative writing course at Crisis Skylight.

She said: 'I started writing my memoirs after I gave up escorting and thought about putting it all into a proper book. I took a creative writing course at Crisis because I thought I needed some kind of therapy and to tap into my creative side.

'I just knew I wanted to tell my story before I died. I went to Rushkin College through the charity Crisis and did a short creative writing course for five days. I did well and I was offered a scholarship place at the Ruskin College to do a creative writing degree.

'The stress of mum's death almost killed me but thankfully I survived to tell the tale. One of the worst things is I had fallen out with her once and didn't speak to her until she told me she had four weeks to live.

'I made sure I made up for it after then. I was so relieved I built bridges before it was too late. I think since she died my children and I are a lot closer.'
