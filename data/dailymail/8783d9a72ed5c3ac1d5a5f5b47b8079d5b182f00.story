Consumer advocacy group Choice are leading the charge against the Federal Government's controversial internet filter proposal by producing a crowd-funded advertisement mocking it.

Through the proposal, the government hopes to stem the tide of music and movie piracy.

Choice's satirical advertisement features a fictitious Minister for the Internet launching his hand-made internet filter.

Choice have released a satirical advertisement mocking the government's internet filter proposal

In the 30-second video, the minister sits behind his desk with the poorly built filter on his desk and a framed photo of Queen Elizabeth II perched on a bookshelf behind him.

With Australia's national anthem swelling, he attempts to deliver his rehearsed lines about the benefits of the filter but fails to do so while it continuously falls apart on him.

'Your government has come up with a fool-proof plan to stop internet piracy,' the Minister for the Internet says.

'Every connection in Australia will be fixed with one of these.

'The increased price we all pay for the internet will be worth it for this 100 per cent effective solution.'

During the minister's speech, a part of the internet filter falls off.

At the end of Choice's video, it urges people to log on to the group's website to sign a petition against the filter.

The 30-second video is part of a campaign Choice is leading against the proposal, which they believe would make the internet more expensive without effectively addressing piracy.

'We believe the government has its policy settings wrong when it comes to combating online copyright infringement,' CHOICE campaigns manager Erin Turner said.

'Australians are frustrated with not being able to access and pay for timely and affordable content. 

'It’s this frustration that is driving some consumers to seek a better deal on legitimate overseas sites like Netflix, and unfortunately driving others to illegal downloading.'

Ms Turner pointed to other countries as examples of expensive models that were not 'meaningfully addressing the problem'.

'Forcing Internet Service Providers to monitor and prevent copyright infringement through the use of an internet filter is not the answer,' Ms Turner said.

'Looking at international examples, we know that the policies proposed are high-cost with low results.

'Policies like this in France and New Zealand have cost significant amounts of money.

'Our fear is that a high-cost system will lead to all consumers paying more for the internet, without meaningfully addressing the problem.'

The advertisement coincides with a review of the government's competition policy due out late this year where Choice detailed new evidence of the artificially high prices Australians pay for identical goods and services purchased from identical websites.

This included paying 33 per cent more than U.S. consumers for the top 10 new release movies in Apple’s iTunes store.

The latest Choice research came on the back of a comprehensive submission to the IT pricing Inquiry in 2012, which detailed more than 200 examples of hefty mark-ups Australia pay on popular digital products.

Ms Turner said the solution to the piracy issue lay in removing the barriers that restricted Australians from purchasing legitimate content from the global market.

'We should be using the pressure of genuine competition to deliver more timely and affordable content to local consumers, not punishing Australians and entrenching outdated business models,' she said.
