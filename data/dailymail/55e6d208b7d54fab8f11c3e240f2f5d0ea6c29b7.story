Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife has added to claims the BBC presenter is getting divorced - and insisted his current partner deserves a large chunk of his estimated £30million fortune.

Alex Hall, who was married to the Top Gear star for six months, came out in support of his current wife, Frances, from whom he is said to be getting divorced.

Miss Hall said Frances had supported Clarkson throughout his lucrative TV career and so deserved a generous divorce settlement.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'She has done her penance... she deserves every penny she gets - she worked for it.'

Miss Hall, who left Clarkson for one of his best friends less than two years after their wedding in 1989, told the paper she thought the current Mrs Clarkson had turned a blind eye to his misbehaving.

She claimed 'decent and honorable' Clarkson is fully in love with Phillipa Sage, the woman said to be his new girlfriend, who has worked with him on Top Gear.

Reports of the alleged affair have put the relationship between millionaire Clarkson and his wife of 21 years, Frances, under growing strain.

The pair have been living apart for 
three years, but had made efforts to stay together and were pictured 
together two months ago.

Last month Mrs Clarkson, 52, went 
on holiday to Majorca with her best friend to toast the end of their 
marriage, a source said. 'Apparently Francie had a really jolly boozy 
time because she is finally getting a divorce from Jeremy and she was 
celebrating that,' the source added.

'All her friends have been waiting 
for years for her to do it and she finally has.'

The
 reports that his marriage is in crisis are a further disaster for 
Clarkson, following on from the 'n-word' controversy which almost cost 
him his job last week.

A 
source close to Clarkson, 54, denied he had divorced and stressed that 
he remained married to his wife for now. But when asked if he was 
'getting divorced', the source replied: 'Getting [divorced] and divorced
 are different.'

If the 
couple do finalise their split, the stage would be set for a large 
payout to Frances, his second wife, because she also works as his 
manager and has been instrumental in building his career – and his 
fortune, put at £30million.

Last
 year he reportedly earned £14million from Top Gear, including his 
salary and payments from a company he set up jointly with the BBC to 
exploit the show commercially worldwide.

The last time the couple, who have two daughters and a son, were seen together was in March at the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

But the marriage has been strained for
 some time. A tabloid newspaper reported in 2002 that the presenter had 
been seen passionately kissing television producer Elaine Bedell in a 
car, and the pair were photographed cuddling in a doorway.

In
 April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with events 
organiser Phillipa Sage while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway
 with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May.

He was alleged to have spent several nights with Miss Sage and kissed her on the lips in full view of observers on one occasion.

Clarkson shrugged off the claims at the time, saying that he and Miss Sage had been simply 'colleagues fooling around'.

But
 shortly afterwards it was revealed that he was spending time during the
 week living in a bachelor pad in London. He denied that he had moved 
out of the family home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, saying he used 
the London flat when he was editing Top Gear.

Last year Clarkson was photographed 
kissing Miss Sage while on holiday with her in Greece, and they also 
visited Australia again.

In October 2011 Clarkson lifted a High
 Court gagging order preventing his first wife, Miss Hall, from claiming
 that he had had an affair with her after he married Frances.

Miss
 Hall alleged that they rekindled their relationship from 1999 
onwards – something he denied.

Clarkson married Frances in 1993 and she encouraged him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona to make Top Gear more controversial, say friends. They take the view that she made his career and that 'he is only Jeremy Clarkson because of her', a source said.

News of a possible divorce comes as Clarkson is under pressure for mumbling something that sounds like the racist N-word in a Top Gear out-take.

He said he was 'mortified' to have apparently used the highly offensive term while reciting the children's nursery rhyme 'Eeny, meeny, miny, moe', and 'begged forgiveness' from fans.

Last night Mrs Clarkson said: 'I do not want to make a comment at this time.' Asked if she could confirm or deny the story, she replied: 'No.'
