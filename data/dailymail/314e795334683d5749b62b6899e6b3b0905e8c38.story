British aid worker Helen Johnston beamed with joy as her rescuers delivered her safely to Kabul.

The 27-year-old thanked could not hide the delight on her face as she was greeted by officials in the Afghan capital yesterday, having been flown from province of Badakhshan.

Miss Johnston is recovering from her kidnap ordeal, which came to dramatic end on Friday when David Cameron sent SAS troops to free her after her captors demanded a £7 million ransom.

The British soldiers – backed by US 
Delta Force, American Navy Seals and Afghan troops – rescued Miss 
Johnston and three other hostages from a cave in the north eastern 
province.

The Prime Minister described it as an
‘extraordinarily brave, breathtaking operation’. Six of the kidnap gang
were shot dead in the SAS raid.

Brave: Helen Johnston was freed on Friday after being kidnapped on May 22 in Badakhshan province

Mr
Cameron gave the go-ahead for the operation when the gang 
threatened to kill Miss Johnston and the other hostages unless an Afghan
drug baron was released from prison and the ransom paid.

Miss Johnston had spent ten days 
inside the cave in a heavily wooded, mountainous hamlet called Asphan, nine miles from the 
nearest road or track.

She was seized at gunpoint on May 22 by
a gang associated with the Taliban. The Briton, a nutritionist who 
works for Medair, a Swiss-based humanitarian group, was held with Kenyan
colleague Moragwa Oirere and two Afghan men, who had been acting as 
their guides.

The gang demanded the immediate release of their leader, a drug baron and people trafficker known as Jallah, who had been arrested a month previously. They also wanted an $11 million dollar (£7million)  ransom and the cessation of all activities by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the area.

By Friday, Mr Cameron had no choice but to send in the SAS after the Afghan government refused to negotiate with the kidnappers.

An Afghan source said: ‘The Afghan government refused to give in to their demands. The gang was told to return the hostages safely or face the consequences.’

After the mission, Miss Johnston’s parents, Philip and Patricia, and her brother Peter said: ‘We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed.

‘We are deeply grateful to everyone involved in her rescue, to those who worked tirelessly on her behalf, and to family and friends for their love, prayers and support over the past 12 days.’

Last night, Mr Johnston, a senior tutor in theology and religious studies at Hughes Hall, Cambridge, declined to add to the family statement. He said: ‘I’m sure you’ve seen our statement. That’s all we are going to say at the moment.'

Rescue: The dramatic raid took place at 2am in Shahr-e-Bozorgd district, in a large forested area near the Tajikistan border called Koh-e-Laran

The SAS mission was given the green light by Mr Cameron at a meeting of COBRA, the national security emergency committee, in London at 3pm on Friday. He took action because information gained by MI6 and US intelligence agents in the city of Faizabad over the past week helped them establish that the risk to Miss Johnston and her fellow hostages was increasing.

Senior military and intelligence officials attended COBRA meetings with MI6 chief Sir John Sawers every day last week as information about the kidnapping flowed in through GCHQ, the Government’s secret communications centre. It was during the COBRA meetings that the ‘nuts and bolts’ of the  rescue plan were put together, and  the Special Forces team was placed on stand-by to deploy once a signal was sent from London.

Mr Cameron attended three of the COBRA meetings.

As the threat to the hostages became increasingly serious, Mr Cameron took advice from the director of UK Special Forces, the head of Defence Intelligence and senior MI6 officials.

They made contact with their US counterparts and those working with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan before the mission was approved.

The SAS and American teams were flown in a Black Hawk helicopter from Bagram air base at  low level just after midnight local time on Friday. Afghan troops are understood to have followed in a second helicopter.

Weighed down with bullet-proof vests, weapons and heavy backpacks, the Special Forces troops then faced a gruelling trek of at least five miles across rough, forest- covered terrain before launching their attack.

They had to land several miles away from their target because the heavily wooded terrain in the area made it difficult for the helicopters to touch down. It was also crucial that the gang did not hear the sound of the engines and rotor blades.

Kidnappers' lair: Aid worker Helen Johnston was held in a cave-dwelling complex

The Afghan troops were used to provide a security cordon around the area of cave dwellings where Miss Johnston and her colleagues were being held.

The Special Forces troops, thought to number a dozen, moved in at about 2am, but were fired at by the kidnappers.

The SAS men replied with a barrage of shots from weapons that included C8 SFW carbines fitted with grenade launchers, Heckler & Koch assault rifles, MP5 machine guns, L96A1 sniper rifles and Browning and Sig Sauer handguns.

They are also thought to have carried a supply of Claymore anti-personnel mines and daggers tucked into boots to use in any close-quarters combat.

Local sources said the gang was  heavily armed with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov assault rifles.

By the end of the gun battle, six of the kidnappers had been shot dead, a similar number were captured and the four hostages were freed unharmed in what a senior military source described as a ‘textbook operation’.

Heroic: The SAS were helicoptered to the cave where the hostages were being held and stormed it, killing the kidnappers and releasing all four captives alive

None of the rescue forces was injured or killed and they and the hostages were evacuated from near the scene by helicopter.

A senior military source said yesterday: ‘It’s a great day for Her Majesty’s Forces on Diamond Jubilee weekend and an even better day for Helen Johnston’s family.’

Mr Cameron said: ‘It was an extraordinarily brave, breathtaking  operation that our troops had to carry out. I pay tribute to their skill and dedication.’

Speaking outside No 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said the rescue should serve as a warning to terrorists across the world who targeted British citizens.

‘They should know if they take British citizens as hostage we do not pay ransoms, we do not trade prisoners. They can expect a swift and brutal end.’

Mr Cameron said decisions on rescue attempts were ‘extraordinarily difficult’ and ‘never rushed into’.

But he said he decided the risks to the hostages lives were becoming too great.

Mr Cameron added that he had spoken to Miss Johnston and to her parents and brother. ‘They are incredibly relieved about what has happened,’ he added.

‘It’s just a huge joy that they are finally going to be reunited and they are all healthy and all well.’

During their brief conversation, Miss Johnston thanked Mr Cameron for the efforts of all those involved in bringing her to safety.

The Prime Minister said the rescue involved a number of British troops, helped by ISAF forces as well the Afghan government.

Dead of night: Troops stormed the cave at 1am, in a bid to surprise the hostage takers while they were asleep

He confirmed that it involved a ‘long route march’ and said the  rescue team had at no time been  discovered.

Paying tribute to the British troops involved, Mr Cameron said: ‘Above all, on this weekend of all weekends, we should say a enormous thank you to the incredibly brave forces that took part in this operation.

‘We will never be able to publish their names, but the whole country should know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do amazingly brave things.’

He added: ‘This weekend we’re going to remember and commemorate 60 years of extraordinary work by Her Majesty the Queen and this weekend we can also remember the frankly incredible work that people who serve in her name do on our behalf all the time.’

Medair, which has worked in Afghanistan since 1996 providing relief to vulnerable and isolated communities, said it was relieved its workers had been released.

Spokesman Aurilien Demaurex said that since the kidnapping, the charity had steered clear of publicity about the situation because it felt that might jeopardise efforts to secure a release.

‘Medair is relieved that our colleagues are safe. We are immensely grateful to all parties involved in ensuring their swift and safe return,’ Mr Demaurex said.

Badakhstan: The hostages were held in a mountainous region close to the border with Tajikistan

The success of yesterday’s rescue comes in the wake of a number of tragedies involving aid staff helping the Afghan people.

In August 2010, British doctor Karen Woo was shot dead in an ambush in Badakhshan as she delivered medical supplies.

The Taliban claimed they killed the 36-year-old aid worker for ‘preaching Christianity.’ But Afghan authorities said her killers were more likely to have been bandits, as they stole Dr Woo’s belongings and passport along with those of her seven colleagues.

Two months later, British aid worker Linda Norgrove died during a failed mission to rescue her from kidnappers in Afghanistan.

Ms Norgrove, 36, was killed by a grenade thrown by a US soldier during the operation, although at her inquest Wiltshire coroner David Ridley did not blame him or his comrades for the tragic mistake.

Three Afghans captured with her were released unharmed a few days later. In Nigeria in March building contractor Chris McManus was killed with an Italian colleague as Nigerian troops and British Special Boat Service commandos launched a rescue mission. Mr McManus had been held by terrorists associated with the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram since May last year.
