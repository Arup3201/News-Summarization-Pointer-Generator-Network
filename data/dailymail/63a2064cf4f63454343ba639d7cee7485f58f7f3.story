Kashmiris were glued to their mobiles today after the authorities in the restive Indian state revoked a ban on text messages.

The four-year-old SMS ban was introduced in response to political unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, an autonomous Indian state, parts of which are disputed by Pakistan.

The ban has now been lifted, at least partly because of improvements in the security situation. Some observers say that the state government is also wooing voters ahead of elections later this year.

Chief Minister Omar Abdullah instructed telephone companies to restore the service from today, a government spokesman told BBC News.

The ban had affected only users of pre-paid mobile phone packages, but with 70 per cent of Jammu and Kashmir's mobile users on such plans it had wide-ranging effects.

A blanket ban on texting was imposed in 2010 when the murders of three Muslim civilians by the Indian army led to massive street protests which descended into riots that shook the Kashmir Valley.

There were claims that mass text messages were being used to to spread rumours which were whipping up emotions among protesters during the unrest.

Then ban was lifted for mobile users on contracts six months later, but pay-as-you-go customers were still restricted.

The decision to revoke the ban comes days after Mr Abdullah - who is half British and was born in Essex - sought policy proposals over social in a bid to win over electorate before assembly elections.

'The government was already considering this,' Tanvir Sadiq, an adviser to Mr Abdullah, told the BBC. 'All aspects were reviewed and it was found that the security situation has improved and there was no need to keep the text messaging blocked.'

But it also became clear that the ban had outlived its usefulness now that a range of smartphone apps which offer users alternative ways to communicate.

Suresh Kumar, Jammu and Kashmir home secretary, told dna India: 'There was no relevance of ban since there are other ways like WhatsApp services available.'

Kashmiris had also taken to the streets in protests against the ban organised by opposition leader Mehbooba Mufti, and various rights groups had challenged it in court.

Jammu and Kashmir is the only state in India which enjoys special autonomy from the central government.

It has been in the grip of an anti-Indian insurgency since 1989 and has been the spark for at least three wars with Pakistan, which disputes Indian control of the territory.
