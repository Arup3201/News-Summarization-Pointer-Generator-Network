Millionaire socialite Margarita Hamilton has accepted a police caution for making too much noise during parties at her 16th Century castle

A millionaire socialite has been given a police caution for making too much noise during late night parties at her 16th Century castle.

Margarita Hamilton, 61, was due to appear before magistrates for breaching a noise abatement notice three times at Walton Castle in Clevedon, Somerset last summer.

But the case was withdrawn after she agreed to sign a caution - meaning she could be jailed if she throws another bash at the Grade II-listed hilltop castle, North Somerset Council has said.

Neighbours of the party queen, who nicknamed herself 'Lady Chatterley' after starting a relationship with an electrician and stonemason who once worked at the property, described her as a 'nightmare' who has 'no respect for anyone'.

They said they have suffered years of noisy parties.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'She's an absolute b***** nightmare.

'One,
two, three o'clock in the morning those parties used to go on to, and 
when people left they'd come screaming down our road waking everyone up.

'She's been quiet for the last few months though, maybe she's finally taking notice of the noise abatement order.'

Another
neighbour, who has lived about half a mile away from the castle for the
last 13 years, has had to call the council more than 100 times to 
complain about the noise.

She said: 'Last summer, one party was so bad that my entire bedroom was shaking - that's how bad it was.'

Mrs Hamilton and her then-husband city financier Roy bought Walton Castle in 1984 and spent £2.5million renovating the property

Neighbours said they have been blighted by late-night parties at Walton Castle for years

'It
was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. I've got friends a mile away 
who said they heard it too - it's a disgrace, that woman has no respect 
for anyone.

'Lately she's been quiet. Apart
from the noise, which was terrible, the problem is also people leaving 
at 2am and having all the cars and taxis on our lane.'

She
added: 'We have only ever met her once. She pulled into our drive, 
rolled her window down and said she couldn't get out of the car because 
she was scared of dogs.

'She
then gave us her number and told us to call her if we had a problem. We
don't do that, we just phone the council and they deal with it.

'I used to have to ring the council at least ten times a year, but she's been quiet for a while.

'I don't mind a bit of noise from a childrens' party in the afternoon, but I do object to late night 2am raves.

'This is a lovely peaceful area and we want to keep it that way.'

The former record company boss, who 
made her fortune in the 1980s and 1990s, has been forced to guarantee 
that music will not be played outside.

A
spokesman for North Somerset Council said: 'Mrs Hamilton has signed a 
caution where she admits breaching a noise abatement notice on three 
occasions last year on 16 June, 21 July and 8 September.

'This
was in relation to loud music at Walton Castle in Clevedon. As well as 
admitting these breaches she has also given us a written undertaking 
that amplified music will not be played outside the building.'

Hamilton
- who also has properties in Zimbabwe and Greece - bought Walton Castle
for £250,000 in 1984 with her then husband, city financier Roy 
Hamilton.

The
couple spent £2.5million renovating the property, which was built in 
1529 on the site of a 10th Century hill fort mentioned in the Doomsday 
Book.

The four-floor castle
is surrounded by eight turrets which have been converted into bedrooms 
sleeping up to 16 guests, and boasts 360 degree views over six counties.

Pop stars Jamiroquai, Paul Weller and Midge Ure are among the guests who have attended charity bashes at the castle.

Margarita Hamilton with boyfriend Steven Penny who died during a party at the restored castle in 2011

Margarita made her name in the music 
business in the 1980s and 1990s, through the Swanyard recording studios 
and record label - which worked with bands such as Pulp, the Pet Shop 
Boys and Robbie Williams, before it closed in 2001.

In 2011, her boyfriend Steven Penny, 43, died during a party at the restored castle.

Mrs Hamilton has referred to herself as 
‘Lady Chatterley’ over her relationship with Mr Penny, whom she met when
he was working on the property as an electrician and stonemason.

He was found face-down in the swimming pool at 4am, three-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit, and with traces of cocaine in his urine at the time of his death.

Police later seized a small bag of the Class A drug from the poolside, but a pathologist ruled that he had not taken the substance on the night he died.

In January last year Margarita was handed a 30-month driving ban after crashing her Audi TT sport car while drunk.

She caused £4,000 damage after ramming a Citroen estate shortly after reading the autopsy report into boyfriend Steven Penny's death.

Police later found her in an underground car park, staggering around drunk and reeking of alcohol.

She was handed a 30-month driving ban and 140 hours unpaid work after admitting driving without due care and attention and failing to provide a specimen of breath at Bristol Crown Court.

Avon and Somerset Police said it could not comment on cases involving cautions.

Hamilton was not at home yesterday and the groundskeeper at her country estate said she had gone to London.
