Former Manchester United manager David Moyes believes that Marouane Fellaini can emerge from the wreckage of a dismal first season at Old Trafford and evolve into an important player for the club.

Moyes, who was sacked in April after enduring a traumatic first campaign in charge of Manchester United, signed Fellaini from the duo’s former side Everton on deadline day of last summer’s transfer window for £27.5million but the Belgian midfielder suffered a torrid debut season, making only 19 starts and failing to score a single goal.

It is understood that United would be receptive to offers approaching £18million for Fellaini, with the former Everton midfielder emerging as a scapegoat for much of the debris of Moyes’ dismal season in charge.

Sportsmail understands that Fellaini is determined to fight for his future at Old Trafford and would only contemplate a move if new manager Louis van Gaal was to indicate that there is no future for him at the club.

Writing in his column for the Sunday Times, Moyes admitted that Fellaini found the ordeal a difficult experience:

‘I felt for him over the criticism he took. He’s a shy boy, a humble boy, a quiet personality. Despite appearances - the hair makes him look like an extrovert - he’s a gentle, sometimes, emotional soul who is so desperate to do well and he was hurting because he wasn’t able to show his true self at the start of his United career.’

‘Without going over old ground regarding last summer’s transfer window, I want to make two points. The last thing we wanted was to makie him my first signing as United manager and the only signing of the summer.

‘That was always going to bring too great a spotlight on him. But by the time we got to deadline day the club hadn’t been able to close a couple of big deals and there was no choice.’

Fellaini demonstrated his qualities with a match-turning performance from the substitute’s bench in Belgium’s 2-1 World Cup win over Algeria, scoring with a crucial goal to lead his side to victory.

‘His size is such a threat to the opposition,’ Moyes continued,’He’s technically gifted, especially when it comes to chest control, and he’s formidable in the air - though, actually, I feel he should score more headers than he does. He can run.

‘He has brilliant fitness, a brilliant attitude. What we saw him do against Algeria was what I brought him to Manchester United for.

'He took time to settle at Old Trafford but in the final month of last season was becoming an influence, a different sort of player to the ones already there and one who was having an impact in games and helping produce goals. I feel he still has the potential to go on and be a good United player.’
