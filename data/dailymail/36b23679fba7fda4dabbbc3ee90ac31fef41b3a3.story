David Cameron today attempted to play down his rivalry with Boris Johnson, by branding the London Mayor a ‘blond-haired mop’.

The Prime Minister insisted he had the ‘opposite of tall poppy syndrome’ and was happy to see Mr Johnson making headlines.

But senior Tories are anxious that the Mayor, who regularly outpolls the PM, could dominate the Conservative party conference with a series of bravura performances in Birmingham this week.

Boris Johnson's outbursts have caused a headache for Tory strategists but prove popular with voters

Last week Mr Johnson stunned ministers when he claimed Downing Street’s slow progress in addressing aviation capacity risked ‘economic catastrophe’.

He has also challenged Mr Cameron over Europe and banking, and even suggested the police should have arrested chief whip Andrew Mitchell for calling officers ‘plebs’.

Today Mr Cameron heaped praise on Mr Johnson, but admitted there was ‘no point trying to contain Boris’.

‘He will always speak his mind. He’s Mayor of London, he can speak out if he wants to.

‘So I have to be, and I am, relatively, as you can see, relaxed about having the blond haired mop sounding off from time to time. Every premiership has its backdrop, and I suspect this is just going to be one of mine,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph.

The Prime Minister and London Mayor are old school friends from Eton, but have had to get used to sharing the limelight

Later Mr Cameron insisted he did not think being London Mayor would be Mr Johnson’s last job.

‘I have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome. I like having other people in the Conservative Party who are popular, who get out there, talk our message and explain our vision and values,’ he told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show.

‘Boris is fantastic like that. He is one of those politicians people warm to and I think it is great that we have in our party figures like that.’

He added: ‘I have said to Boris: “Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don't think your job in politics is over”.

‘I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that.‘I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.’

The charm offensive comes as senior Tories fear Mr Johnson’s antics will dominate the four-day conference.

One opinion showed voters prefer the London Mayor to Mr Cameron by a wide margin. The survey by pollsters Opinium for The Observer gave Mr Johnson a net +30 rating compared to -21 for the Prime Minister.

Today Tim Loughton, a former education minister, said that Mr Johnson's potential leadership challenge was a ‘sideshow’.

‘Boris is a fantastic character; very media savvy, very high recognition for doing a fantastic job as Mayor of London but he’s not going to be Prime Minister of this country, he’s not going to be leader of the Conservative party,’ he told Sky News.
