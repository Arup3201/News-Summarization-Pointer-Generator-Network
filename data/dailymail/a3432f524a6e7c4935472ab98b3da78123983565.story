This is the moment two teenage boys threw a defenceless cat over an eight-foot garden fence into the grip of a pair of dogs.

CCTV footage shows the thugs walking along a pathway behind homes in Bradford, West Yorkshire, before picking up the black and white feline by the neck and hurling her.

The cat was left severely shaken after the ordeal but was unhurt according to RSPCA inspectors.

Attack: The two boys in Bradford are seen grabbing the black and white cat by the scruff of the neck

Police have launched an urgent appeal to track down the two boys, who are both white with dark hair.

One was dressed in a light blue hooded zip-up top with white sleeves while the other boys was dressed in dark trousers and a black jacket.

Investigating RSPCA inspector Rachel Oprysk said: 'The owner heard a commotion in her backyard and when she went out she saw her cat land on the paved area and run off in sheer terror.

'Luckily, the whole incident was all caught on CCTV.

'At first the boys appeared to be stroking the cat just outside the property but then they picked her up by the scruff of the neck and threw her high over the wooden fence and iron gate.

'We believe these boys threw the cat over the garden boundary with the intention of her being attacked by the Rottweiler and Alaskan Shepherd on the other side.

'Luckily the garden they chose was the cat’s home so the dogs were used to the cat and did not see her as an intruder.

RSPCA inspectors said the cat survived the ordeal shaken but unhurt. Police are now searching for the boys

'The black and white female cat was shaken and scared but, thankfully, otherwise unhurt.

'We are keen to track down the boys caught on the CCTV footage as we believe they intended to cause harm to the cat and it is only by sheer luck this was not a more upsetting and horrific incident.'

Anyone with information about the incident on April 20 should contact the RSPCA
