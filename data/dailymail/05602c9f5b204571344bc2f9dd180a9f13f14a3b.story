A fan trying to videobomb a reporter outside a hockey game landed on thin ice.

The unidentified Detroit Red Wings fan tried to jump into a live report from outside Wednesday’s NHL Winter Classic, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and fell hard on to the sidewalk.

Wintry weather in the area that day left a slick coating on to of most surfaces, something the fan clearly didn't take into account.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Grand entrance: At first, the fan appears to cleverly slide into the live shot

The report was from outside a hockey game between the Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs in front of well over 100,000 fans in heavy snow squalls.

It was the latest installment of the NHL's annual outdoor game, this time held at the University of Michigan football stadium known as 'The Big House.'

A Red Wings fan jumps into view from the right side of the screen with his arms wide open and a big grin on his face.

The fan is decked out in a team jersey and hat, as well as sun glasses.

Down he goes: Then his feet fly out from under him

The agony: He slowly gets up after falling on the icy cement sidewalk

Licking his wounds: He then sheepishly slinks off as if nothing happened

He is unable to find his footing. His feet hit the ice and come right out from under him, causing him to almost face-plant when he falls down.

The reporter appears to be unaware of what just happened, and advises people to come down to the stadium to 'check out the fan fair even if they have no tickets.'

The fan, wearing the jersey of hall of fame Red Wings captain Gordie Howe, sheepishly gets up and staggers off licking his wounds.

That wasn’t the only setback the he would deal with Wednesday, the Red Wings lost the game 3-2 in an overtime shootout.

A Detroit player lost control of the puck as he made his way toward the goalie – snow on the ice caused it to skip up instead of gliding.

The wintry weather took the fan’s feet out from under him and a potential win from his team.
