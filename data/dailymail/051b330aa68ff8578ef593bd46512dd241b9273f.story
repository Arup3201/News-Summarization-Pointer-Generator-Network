Hanging precariously over the bank of a swollen creek, this house is in imminent danger of complete collapse.

The property has had almost half of its foundations swept away by floods that have drenched central Sweden over the last few days.

Approximately 1,000 square metres of land collapsed around the building, which is located in Nyhammar, a small town in the county of Dalarna.

Last night, there were fears that a dam near Flen lake on the Ema river would burst.

Flooding caused a sewage treatment 
plant in Rattvik to release sater contaminated with raw sewage spilled 
into Lake Silhan, reports TheLocal.se.

Roger Lundquist, of water management 
firm Dala Vatten, said: 'The plant couldn't handle the high water flows 
and couldn't take in all the water that came. It led to untreated sewage
flowing out into the lake.'

Government minister Catharina 
Elmsäter-Svärd, in charge of infrastructure, said climate change and 
higher water levels need to be addressed as soon as possible.

She told Svergies Television: 'Huge 
investments are going to be needed. The entire city of Gothenburg is at a
level which means that if water levels rise, we must plan on building 
levees.'

There was good news this morning, however, as the water levels in lakes reservoirs began to fall.
