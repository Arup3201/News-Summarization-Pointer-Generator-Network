The New York City Marathon has been canceled after residents protested plans for it to go ahead in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy's widespread destruction.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said yesterday evening that the annual 26.2-mile race will not be held this Sunday, despite workers spending the days after Sandy preparing the course.

The mayor had previously defended his stance to have the race to proceed, despite the fact that millions across the five boroughs remain without clean water, food, and electricity.

Should the New York marathon go ahead, despite thousands still suffering black-outs?

'The Marathon has been an integral part of New York City's life for 40 years and is an event tens of thousands of New Yorkers participate in and millions more watch,' Mayor Bloomberg said in the statement.

'While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division.'

He added: 'We would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it.

'We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event -- even one as meaningful as this -- to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track.'

The race is likely to be held at a later date although no details were given as to when this would take place.

It is also unclear whether any of the nearly 50,000 runners who were expected to compete in Sunday’s marathon, thousands of whom traveled to New York from other countries, would be compensated in any way.

The move to cancel the event is historic as it has been held every year since 1970, including in 2001 when the marathon took place just two months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

But the cancellation was almost 
inevitable after opposition, from runners as well as politicians and 
residents of the worst affected areas, intensified as days wore on 
post-storm.

At a news 
conference on Friday, Mayor Bloomberg defended his initial decision to 
go ahead with the marathon as a way to raise money for the city and 
boost morale less than a week after Sandy knocked out power and left a 
death toll of 109 people.

He noted that his predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, went ahead with the New York Marathon two months after 9/11.

‘If you go back to 9/11, Rudy made 
the right decision in those days to run the marathon and pull people 
together,' Bloomberg said.

The
mayor added that the marathon's organizers are ‘running this race to 
help New York City, and the donations from all the runners in the club 
will be a great help for our relief efforts.’

Earlier
this week, the mayor said the race wouldn't siphon off resources from 
the storm recovery, noting electricity is expected to be restored to all
of Manhattan by race day, freeing up ‘an enormous number of police.’

The New York Road Runners, which partners with ING for each race, could not immediately be reached.

Business owner Paul Wilson agreed 
with Bloomberg’s desire to continue with the marathon. Wilson, who owns 
Bar East on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, said the weekend after the 
superstorm was ‘the perfect time to have it.’

He said: ‘I don’t think the timing could have been better.’

Runners along the 26.2-mile course pass right next to Wilson’s bar.

The course runs from the 
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on hard-hit Staten Island to Central Park, 
sending runners through all five boroughs.

The course of the marathon wasn't going to be changed if it went ahead on Sunday, as there was little damage along the route.

Even
before Bloomberg's announcement this evening, as organisers put 
finishing touches to the finish line, Staten Island residents were 
crying as they saw their 
devastated neighborhood.

Residents - some of whom have had to 
wade through local dumpsters to find food and supplies - were demanding 
to know why generators used for the race were not being used to help those in desperate need.

A third generator would not even have been used unless there was an emergency - 
causing even more friction between organisers and residents over what Mayor Bloomberg considered an emergency.

For days officials in the storm-ravaged 
tri-state area insisted that plans to go ahead with the New York Marathon would not affect
recovery efforts, but they were in the minority.

Congressman
Michael Grimm, whose district includes the devastated 
borough of Staten Island, was one of several prominent politicians who 
earlier yesterday voiced his fury that the annual race was going ahead, 
even while 
many on the island are without water, food, and electricity.

‘There’s no question I’m angry about it,’ the representative said, just hours before the event was called off.

‘The 
city of New York is talking about getting water out of the Battery 
Tunnel and getting ready for the marathon. We’re pulling bodies out of 
the water.’

Speaking on the Today show, Rep Grimm, who represents the 13th 
District of New York, said that residents of the borough are barely 
coping in the wake of Sandy, and the last thing on their minds is a 
race.

‘There are those walking the street and they seem almost hopeless,’ he 
said. ‘They’ve lost everything and there’s nowhere for them to go.'

More than 100 homes were destroyed in Breezy Point, Queens. Flatbed trucks that originally helped with rescue operations had been diverted to prepare for the marathon, which is now canceled

Nevertheless, the Mayor's office had said: ‘Our recover efforts are ongoing and none of those will 
be impacted by the marathon. No resources will be diverted.’

'There are people right now that have no heat who have no food and are 
sitting in the dark.

'To say that we have enough resources just isn’t 
accurate. There’s a lot of unanswered questions. We feel that no one 
understands us.'

Staten Island Councilman James Oddo echoed Rep Grimm’s anger.

'The 
notion of diverting even one police officer, one first responder, one 
asset away from this carnage, is beyond irrational,’ he told the Daily 
News.

Earlier, Mayor Bloomberg said he saw none of the damage or power outtages as 
insurmountable, and defended the decision to hold the race, insisting 
resources wouldn't be diverted from storm victims.

He noted at a news conference on Thursday that electricity was expected to 
be restored to all of Manhattan by race day, freeing up ‘up an enormous 
number of police'.

‘This city is a city where we have to go on,’ he said.

But many New Yorkers didn't feel that accurately reflected the current 
situation.

A petition on Change.org asked Bloomberg and other officials 
to postpone the ING Marathon until the spring of next year.

‘Police, fire, and other emergency services should not be diverted to 
the Marathon during this time of crisis,’ the petition read. ‘This 
event is always a positive event and it should not be turned into a 
hugely negative drain on city resources.’

Some critics also questioned whether the marathon should go ahead at all.

The marathon would have brought an estimated $340million into the city.

Organizers 
would have used it as a backdrop to raise money for recovery efforts. Race
organizer NYRR will donate $1million to the fund and said more than 
$1.5million in pledges already had been secured from sponsors.
