Today show hosts Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer and Al Roker confessed to having had 'sexy dreams about their co-anchors' while playing a game 'Never Have I Ever' live on-air during this morning's show.

Savannah, 43, looked particularly shame-faced as she held up her 'I have' sign in response to 57-year-old Matt's probing question, which was posed as part of the confessional party game.

Ironically however, the mother-of-one was furious when Carson Daly, Willie Geist and Today show special correspondent Ryan Seacrest denied ever having had inappropriate dreams about their fellow hosts, saying: 'I'm actually offended at this, on behalf of every woman on this cast.

Red-faced: Savannah Guthrie, 43, looked particularly embarrassed when she made her confession

Question time: Savannah, Matt Lauer and Al Roker all confessed to having had inappropriate dreams about their co-hosts during an on-air game of 'Never Have I Ever'

'Really, never?'

'Not yet,' Carson replied, grinning, before adding: 'Maybe tonight. If you keep yelling at me like that, maybe.'

Moving on to his next question, Matt inquired as to whether any of the panelists had used their celebrity status in order to avoid being given a speeding ticket. 

Ryan, 40, Al, 60, and Matt all confessed to having flashed their famous faces in the hopes of avoiding a ticket, with Ryan revealing that he was actually driving close friend and X Factor judge Simon Cowell's car at the time.  

'Strangely enough I happened to be driving Simon Cowell's car at the time, it's a longer story but... I have.

'I was borrowing it.' 

Outrage: The mother-of-one was furious at Carson Daly and Willie Geist after they revealed that they had never had a sexy dream about their female co-stars

Sharing is caring: Both Matt (L) and Al (R) were more than happy to admit that they have seen each other naked 'several times'

Fun and games: The team all agreed to be 'completely honest' while playing the party game

Moving swiftly on, the questions returned to more crude subject matters, with Matt asking the panel: 'Never have I ever been drunk on the air?'

The father-of-three grinned proudly while holding up his own 'I have' sign, before being joined by Willie and Carson, who declared: 'I love it, I love the honesty.'

But the TV hosts declined the opportunity to share any further details about their past indiscretions, with Matt simply stating: 'It was a long night.'

Clearly happy to move on to the fourth, and final, question of the game, Matt quickly asked: 'Never have I ever seen someone on this panel naked?'

While the majority of the panel happily held up their 'I have never' signs, both Matt and Al confessed to having seen the other person naked, with Matt admitting he'd seen Al without his clothes on 'several times', while Al added: 'We weren't even at work!' 

The team's decision to play the embarrassing game live on-air came after they saw TV host Ellen DeGeneres challenge the cast of upcoming comedy movie Mortdecai to reveal some secrets about themselves during her show.

Gwyneth Paltrow, Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany all embraced the game with great enthusiasm, with Johnny, 51, volunteering that he has had a romantic rendezvous aboard an airplane, and Gwyneth, 42, admitting that she's enjoyed a similar Mile High Club experience in her past.

The self-styled lifestyle guru took the game one step further, also confessing that she has 'sexted' in the past as well.

Ellen began by asking the trio: 'Never have I ever been to a nude beach?'

While both Gwyneth and Ellen claimed that they hadn't, Johnny and Paul admitted that they had both doffed their clothes to stroll naked on the sand.

Ellen's next question was even more interesting: 'All right, never have I ever been arrested?' 

Gwyneth immediately proffered her 'I have never' paddle, while Paul quickly put up 'I have'. Johnny took a few more minutes to consider, before also admitted that he had as the audience cheered in support.
