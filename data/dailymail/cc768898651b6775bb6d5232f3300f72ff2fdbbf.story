Jamie O'Brien seems to have perfected the art of the board transfer.

The 31-year-old surfer from Hawaii appeared in a GoPro video posted to YouTube that shows the acrobatic athlete jumping from one surfboard to another as a giant wave crests behind him.

O'Brien was riding waves at Banzai Pipeline, often referred to simply as Pipeline, off the island of O'ahu, famous in surfing circles for the tubes created by reefs under the water.

Poised: In a video for GoPro, Jamie O'Brien caught a wave at Pipeline off the coast of the island of O'ahu with a second board in tow

Transfer: With a lighter board at the ready, O'Brien was looking to jump off and ride out the giant curl while filming the feat

Daring: Just above the reef break, O'Brien hopped off the longer board and rode out the wave

'The process is to have fun,' O'Brien says in the video. 'Pick the right wave, grab the board off the front with one hand, spin it around, hopefully pull in and come out.'

The surfer carried his second, lighter board on the front, and when the time came, maneuvered it into position and took off down the wave. 

O'Brien has been trying to perfect the trick since at least 2013, when he was filmed attempting the switch at Second Reef, the second section from the shore where waves typically break.

Team: O'Brien is sponsored by Red Bull, which has partnered in the past with GoPro, a company that has hosted O'Brien for events in the past

Tubular: O'Brien recorded footage from inside the curling wave with the help of a camera mounted onto his body

Surfer Magazine reports that O'Brien 'doubled up' back in August, successfully hitting his board transfer at the Wedge, a surf spot in Newport Beach, California, but this attempt was captured in multiple angles.

The Red Bull-sponsored athlete was filmed with multiple cameras from GoPro, who has partnered with the energy drink company in the past and has hosted O'Brien at events, according to ESPN.
