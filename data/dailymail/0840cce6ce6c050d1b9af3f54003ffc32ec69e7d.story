The 2015 Turf Flat season begins with Sunday’s Lincoln Handicap card at Doncaster. Racemail answers some intriguing questions.

Can Godolphin finally regain the ‘fear factor’?

Only one European Group One winner in 2014 — Charming Thought in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket — was an unacceptably thin return for Sheik Mohammed’s lavishly-funded Godolphin operation.

Charming Thought’s trainer Charlie Appleby was fully aware of the need to do better when he said in October: ‘Ten years ago, we were at the top of the table and everyone was frightened of us. That’s where we will hopefully be again in a year or two.’

The organisation, badly tarnished by the 2013 Mahmood Al Zarooni drug scandal, has seen significant changes, with horses now spread beyond the Appleby-Saeed Bin Suroor twin Newmarket operation. Horses will race in the Godolphin colours from the stables of Jim Bolger and Michael Halford in Ireland, Andre Fabre in France and John Gosden in Britain while they have acquired Richard Hannon’s 2014 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder and a share in Roger Varian’s Dewhurst Stakes scorer Belardo.

Top jockeys William Buick and James Doyle have been recruited and the Sheik spent another fortune on yearling talent. Appleby has cleaned up on this winter’s all-weather circuit but, given his ammunition, at times that has seemed like pitting Mitchell Johnson against a third XI batsman. The serious stuff is ahead for an organisation that has not punched its weight.

Is the Qatari juggernaut unstoppable?

They may lag behind the horse numbers of Dubai’s Maktoum family but Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s Pearl and Qatar Racing now have almost 250 horses while Sheik Joaan Al Thani, who retains Frankie Dettori, has doubled his European string to 150, half of them based here.

With the likes of Racing Post Trophy winner Elm Park and £800,000 buy Moheet, who scooted home on his Salisbury debut in October, in their team, a first British Classic win could arrive this summer. Expensive new sponsorships will also be rolled out for the first time at Newbury and Glorious Goodwood as the Qatari influence spreads.

Is Aidan O’Brien nailed on for a fourth Derby?

When Australia followed up the Epsom successes of Ruler Of The World and Camelot last June it was a historic Derby hat-trick for Ireland’s dominant trainer and a fourth successive victory looks highly likely.

He already has a vice-like grip on this year’s race with favourites JF Kennedy and Ol’ Man River among seven of his horses in the first nine in the ante-post betting and Ladbrokes make it even money that an O’Brien horse wins the Derby.

Will Jockeys Championship changes mean a new winner?

Despite the marketing vandalism of shortening the title race from 2,000 Guineas day at Newmarket on May 2 to Champions Day at Ascot on October 17, it is likely to be the same shootout between Ryan Moore and the defending champion Richard Hughes, who retires at the end of the season. But do not rule out a hungry Silvestre De Sousa, freelancing and out to prove a point after being ditched by Godolphin.

Richard Hannon to be champion trainer again?

Sheer weight of numbers would suggest so. Hannon, with more than 250 horses in his care, has to be favourite. He has lost Olympic Glory and Toronado to stud but closest rival John Gosden has waved goodbye to Kingman and Taghrooda. Both have a clutch of Classic hopes. Roger Varian — with St Leger winner and Arc fourth Kingston Hill plus 2,000 Guineas hope Belardo — could narrow the gap but it is a blow that injury means filly Cursory Glance misses the 1,000 Guineas.

A final Classic win for Barry Hills?

Having retired in 2011, Hills, 78 next month, took out his licence again when son John died last year. He retires again at the end of the season but is overseeing a string of almost 40 horses owned by Sheik Hamdan. Among them are 1,000 Guineas hope Fadhayyil and 2,000 Guineas hope Nafaqa.
