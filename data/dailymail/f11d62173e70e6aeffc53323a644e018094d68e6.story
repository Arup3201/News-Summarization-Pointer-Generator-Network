The mother of a young woman killed in a car crash caused by boy racers went to confront the driver in jail to hear him apologise in person.

Kate Morgan said she felt 'numb' when she came face-to-face with Ian Edwards, who was responsible for the death of her 22-year-old daughter Lona Wyn Jones.

But the prison meeting allowed her to recover from the trauma of losing her daughter, and to have a good night's sleep for the first time in two years.

Lona was killed in a crash in North Wales in May 2012, when a car she was travelling in span out of control during an 80mph race with another vehicle.

Edwards, 25, was jailed for three years and nine months after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, but Ms Morgan, 45, was haunted by the crash afterwards.

'After Lona's death I felt like I was living in a bubble,' she said. 'I was completely numb for a long time. I did want Ian to get some punishment, but it wasn't particularly important to me whether he was jailed. Five minutes or 1,000 years in jail wasn't going to bring Lona back.

'Months later, when life without Lona wasn't getting any easier, I realised that I had questions only Ian could answer. When the family liaison officers were with me one day, I suddenly asked out of the blue if I could go and meet him in prison.'

After Edwards agreed to the hour-long meeting, Ms Morgan travelled with a friend to Risley prison in Warrington, Cheshire to meet the driver, who was accompanied by his father.

'I was apprehensive on the morning of the visit, but it was something I needed to do,' she said. 'I wanted the crash explained to me, to know whether it had happened the way I'd been told. And I wanted to look him in the face and see how it had affected him.

'I went to see Ian because I needed answers. I had to know exactly how Lona had been killed, before I could even try to move on. When I first saw him I felt numb. I can remember looking at him and thinking, you b******.

'In that situation you're only allowed to ask three questions, but I only wanted to ask the one. He could tell that was the real reason I was there, so he talked me through the crash. He admitted he and another driver had been speeding, racing each other.

'The other car had pulled back into his lane, he said, which had made him swerve and mount the grass verge. I could see how sorry he was and he apologised repeatedly.

'I told him I accepted his apology but I didn't forgive him and hoped to never see him again. That night, I slept properly for the first time in two years.

'Afterwards, I felt instantly more at ease because I no longer had the "not knowing" feeling. I finally had closure - there were no more secrets.'

Lona, a carer from Dolgellau, had started renting her own house near her mother and 12-year-old sister Ella shortly before the fatal crash.

Edwards was said by eyewitnesses to have been 'driving like a lunatic' in his Ford Fiesta as Lona sat in the back seat, before he lost control and flipped the car over. Lona died at the scene from head injuries.

Ms Morgan said: 'Lona had come to see me in the afternoon. She was still all excited about her cottage - she'd just got a new fridge freezer and had stocked it up, so I joked that she'd have to invite me and Ella round for tea at the weekend.

'She was going to her dad's that evening. He lived about 20 miles away so her best friend Fay and another friend Ian, who I'd not met before, were going to give her a lift.

'They arrived at about 5.30. Ian had a silver Ford Fiesta and I waved them off, giving Lona a big hug before she went. She'd always been so independent and mature, we felt like friends rather than mum and daughter.

'Two hours later, a neighbour knocked at the door to tell me there'd been a crash and Lona was involved. I left Ella with another neighbour and rushed out in the car. The drive passed in a blur. I hit a long queue of traffic so I got out of the car and just started running.

'When I got to the crash scene there was a car on its side, covered in a tarpaulin. A police officer I recognised came over. I asked her if it was Lona under there and she just nodded. I was shocked.'

As well as his jail sentence, Edwards was banned from driving for four years after he appeared at Caernarfon Crown Court in August 2013.

Ms Morgan said: 'In lots of ways I have been able to try and move on, but there is a massive hole in my life. My best friend is gone. Birthdays and Christmases are never the same.

'Ella has since started high school and she was sad that her sister wouldn't be able to see her in her big school uniform. Every day we can feel it - it is a life sentence.'
