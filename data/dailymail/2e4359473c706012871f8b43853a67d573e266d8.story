A bloodied drug addict falls into a stupor as he injects a bags-worth of potent Mexican heroin into his foot.

Disturbing as it may be, this is an all-too-familiar sight on Chicago's West Side.

The addict, named Rico, is just one of hundreds of the city's homeless population in the grip of the city's heroin 'epidemic'.

And not all of them have grown up in inner city slums, as you might expect.

There has has been a rise in the number of 'suburban addicts' ending up on the streets too.

The problem has been blamed on Mexican cartels flooding the streets with, what local and national government officials say, is some of the highest purity heroin there has ever been.

This haunting project - titled Poison Brown - is the work of photographer Chuck Jines, 47, who has spent almost a year documenting the plight of Chicago's addicts.

His images show the squalid conditions in which they live - in cardboard boxes, under bridges and car parks - and how they will do anything to get their next fix.

Mr Jines, who started shooting documentary projects in 2008, said he was shocked by the level of drug abuse he found.

'It's truly remarkable how the city revealed itself to me,' he said.

'Heroin is everywhere. It's as if one day a mysterious veil was suddenly lifted and I was shown a world that dwells just beneath the surface.

'The whole experience has made me more grateful for what I have and who I am.'

Heroin abuse is believed to be dropping in the UK but is rising in the US, where there are thought to be half a million addicts.

In Chicago's West Side, where open-air drug markets operate, a bag of heroin can cost as little as $10 (Â£6) and a typical addict uses up to 20 bags a day.

Mr Jines's photographic project began in June 2013 as a follow-up to another project about a group of homeless people he called the 'Alley Boys'.

Through his connections he was able to start meeting and photographing heroin addicts and their world.

He said: 'I've developed a reputation on the streets over the years for being an authentic person. I'm straight-up and I show people respect.

'I started out by focusing on one addict named Kevin. From there I began to develop relationships with several other addicts.

'It takes a lot of waiting. It can be hard to catch people "home". Often addicts are in and out of jail, so the story is continually on delay.

'The worst part of this was watching people destroy themselves, sleeping in s***, sticking dirty needles into their abscess-speckled bodies.'

He added: 'Today I have addicts who approach me because they've heard of me and want to be part of the story.

'Generally the people in my photos are folks that I've come to actually like as people. If I don't like someone, I don't invest in the relationship.

'Like in most social strata, there are both good and bad people in the heroin world. I see some who are truly haunted by their addictions and have a true desire to quit - but I also know addicts who maintain that they literally love their addiction to heroin.

'A lot of them are dead. If the heroin doesn't get them, hepatitis or the streets themselves will get them. You don't see many old heroin addicts out here.'

Mr Jines, who has 'not for a millisecond' been tempted to try heroin, says his view on heroin use and the 'War on Drugs' has changed over the last year.

He now believes heroin needs to be decriminalised to stop it spreading across the country.

This comes in spite of the high-profile arrest in Mexico of Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman, the alleged head of the Sinaloa Cartel, who last year was described as 'Chicago's Public Enemy Number One'.

'I advocate for a three-pronged approach: prevention, harm reduction, and treatment,' Chuck said.

'In every culture and society there will always be a certain percentage of the population that become addicted to drugs such as heroin.

'The situation becomes inflated through the War On Drugs which has created an atmosphere of crime, mass imprisonment and unnecessary death.

'The drug cartels make money, the dealers make money, the government makes money and private enterprise makes money.

'Legalising the use and sale of drugs deflates the whole situation by removing the money incentive.'

Mr Jines, who is married and lives on the outskirts of Chicago, is now documenting the gang culture that thrives in Chicago's West Side and plans to publish a book of his work in the next year.

Heroin addicts can consume up to 20 bags of the drug every day and will do whatever they can in between to get the money to pay for it

This number is increasing because of the easy availability of cheap and pure heroin flooding in from Mexico
