These shocking images of a little boy shot in the head have emerged hours after Syrian president Bashar Assad claimed his army was only targeting terrorists.

The boy is from the Bayada neighbourhood of Homs, northeast of the capital, Damascus.

He was wounded in the head after he was allegedly hit by the Syrian army during the recent uprisings in his hometown.

The projectile entered the back of his head and can be seen lodged above his left eye.

Warning: Syrian president Bashar Assad has said his country is different to others where similar uprisings have occurred

In his first interview with a Western
paper, published in the Sunday Telegraph, Assad claimed that he was a 
popular president and added that his army was only now targeting 
terrorists.

During the 
interview Assad also warned Western intervention against his regime 
would cause an 'earthquake' that would 'burn the whole region'.

President Assad said the action could lead to 'another Afghanistan'.

Defying worldwide condemnation of his actions, he said any outside aggression would ‘burn the whole region’.

Assad's ultimatum came as hundreds of demonstrators marched to the Syrian embassy in London to show solidarity with victims of the seven-month uprising.

In a two-hour rally outside the building in Belgrave Square, protesters chanted ‘get out Assad’ and ‘free Syria’.

Activists claim Syrian forces killed more than 50 civilians in violent clashes over the weekend. At least 3,000 people – including 200 children – have died during the unrest.

Thirty soldiers also died in fierce fighting in the city of Homs and in an ambush in the northern province of Idlib on Saturday.

Assad conceded that the West would ‘ratchet up the pressure’ but said his country was different ‘in every respect’ from Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen, where other rebellions had taken place.

Home: The Syrian president lives in Damascus and claims he is popular with his people because he lives an ordinary life

Assad lives a relatively modest life-style and claims this has made him popular with his people.

He lives in Damascus with his wife Asma and their three children in a small, but guarded house in an ordinary street.

The president, who can regularly be seen on the school run, said he lives a normal life and even drives his own car.

‘Syria is the hub now in this region.
It is the fault line and if you play with the ground you will cause an 
earthquake,’ he said.

‘Do you want to see another Afghanistan, or tens of Afghanistans? Any problem in Syria will burn the whole region.

If the plan is to divide Syria, that 
is to divide the whole region.’ He admitted his forces made ‘many 
mistakes’ at the start of the uprising, but claimed only ‘terrorists’ 
were being targeted now.

Assad also claimed his modest 
lifestyle made him a popular leader. ‘The first component of popular 
legitimacy is your personal life. It is very important how you live,’ he
said.

‘I drive my own car, we have neighbours, I take my kids to school. That’s why I’m popular.’

Unrest: Protesters burn images of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a protest earlier this month

Unpopular: Britain, France, the U.S, the United Nations and the Arab League have spoken out against the Syrian president

The president made his remarks as demands grew for a Libya-style no-fly zone over Syria.

The resilience of the protesters, the
determination of the authorities to crush dissent and the growing armed
insurgency have combined to make Syria’s  turmoil one of the most 
intractable confrontations of this year’s Arab uprisings.

Western governments have called on 
the country’s embattled leader to step down, and have already imposed 
sanctions on Syrian oil exports and state businesses

President Assad insisted his response
to the Arab Spring was not one of ‘stubborn government’, adding: ‘Six 
days after (the protests began) I commenced reform.’ He also insisted 
the pace of reform was ‘not too slow’.

The latest wave of violence was met 
with strong criticism from the Arab League, which issued a statement 
expressing ‘disgust’ at the killing of civilians.

An Arab League committee was due to meet a Syrian delegation in Qatar yesterday to discuss ways to solve the crisis.

Britain, France, the U.S and the United Nations have all openly criticised the Syrian president over the past few months.

The Arab League also sent a message to Assad and said they hoped the government would try to protect its citizens.

One
of the protest leaders told the Sunday Telegraph said that protesters 
were not calling for economic reform but wanted Assad out, followed by 
free elections.
