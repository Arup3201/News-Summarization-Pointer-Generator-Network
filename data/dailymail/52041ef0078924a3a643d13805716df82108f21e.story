A teenager whose leg became trapped by rocks at the base of a waterfall in Washington state has been saved by quick-thinking sheriff's deputies and firefighters in a dramatic rescue scene.

Johnny Napierkowski, 19, was stuck in the 60 degree water at Dougan Falls on the Washougal River for around an hour on Monday night until rescuers used an advanced rope harness system to help pull him free.

Authorities said the teen was lucky to be alive, explaining that if he wasn't so tall - he stands at 6ft 7 - or if the water level had been higher, they would have been recovering his body rather than rescuing him.

Napierkowski had been swimming with four friends and his younger brother at Dougan Falls when he saw one of
 his pals slide down the rocks of the area's lower waterfall and plunge into the water. Napierkowski thought it looked like fun so he went after him.

Rescue: Skamania County sheriff's deputies and firefighters can be seen rescuing John Napierkowski, who was trapped in the water at Dougan Falls on the Washougal River, with a series of ropes and harness systems. He became stuck after trapping his leg in rocks

'I thought it was safe, and it wasn't,' he told The Columbian from his hospital bed. 'It was a hard lesson learned, but it's learned.'

As he landed in the water, he turned and his right leg became wedged between a rock and the pressure of the water, trapping him.

The
 tall teen was able to keep his head above water as he yelled for help 
and grabbed on to nearby rocks to hold himself up against the current.

'It felt like I kept 
getting tackled over and over and over again,' he said. 'There was no 
way for me to be able to move. It was one big, continuous force pushing 
me away.'

A witness called 
911 at 8.10pm and, while his friends waited for rescuers, they tied 
together two belts and used it to help keep him above the water, while 
other bystanders threw in ropes, the Columbian reported.

'They're all my heroes,' he said. 'The whole time, I was thinking, wow, my brother might not have an older brother pretty soon.'

When authorities arrived, they found the teenager chest-high in the water. Emergency
 crews tied ropes to him and also gave him a life jacket, Skamania County Sheriff Dave Brown 
said.

Then they gave him a harness and attached an additional rope.

'First
 responders then began pulling on the rope from upriver and were able to
 free Napierkowski,' a press release from the sheriff's office said.

The
 teen told the Columbian that he had to summon enough energy to push 
himself through the waterfall to escape danger.

'I felt like my leg was going to snap or something,' he said. But, 'I knew I wasnâ€™t getting out any other way.'

Napierkowski, who was trapped in the 60 degree water for around an hour,
 was taken to Peacehealth 
Southwest Medical Center, where he remains hospitalized as he recovers 
from hypothermia, muscle damage and extreme fatigue.

Authorities warned people to exercise extreme caution near the waterfall.

'This stretch of warm weather has kept 
first responders busy throughout the area,' Brown said. 'We encourage people visiting the Dougan
 Falls area and other popular swimming areas to be safe, use a life 
jacket when necessary and know the hazards so that you can avoid trouble
 if possible.'

Napierkowski is not the first person to become trapped in the area below the falls.

Four years ago, a 14-year-old boy from Wilsonville, Oregon, got his leg trapped between boulders in the river below Dougan Falls. The water in that case reached to the boy's nose before he was rescued.
