The father of Sandy Hook victim Emilie Parker broke down in tears on Thursday night as friends, relatives and strangers paid tribute to his blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter in his Utah hometown.

Robbie Parker held a public memorial for his six-year-old daughter at Ben Lomond High School in Ogden, sensing the community wished to give the grieving father and his family their support.

Hundreds of mourners filled the school, with girls wearing pink tops and men in pink ties in a nod to Emilie's favourite colour. Others wore green, the colour uniting those mourning for Sandy Hook.

But one person was notably missing: Friends said Emilie's mother Alissa was still too fragile to appear in public and chose to forego the service to spend time with her two other daughters.

Just six days earlier, Robbie and Alissa were pictured leaving Sandy Hook Elementary School - Alissa's face creased in pain, Robbie's mouth open in disbelief - after learning that their eldest daughter had been shot dead along with 19 other students and six teachers.

They have now returned with her body to Ogden and a funeral will take place on Saturday. The couple were high school sweethearts in the Utah town before moving to Newtown, Connecticut.

Robbie Parker struggled to control his emotions throughout the memorial service, where a slideshow of Emilie's life was shown and relatives spoke about the young girl, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

'Even though this was a very personal and internal thing for us, I could see it touched everybody,' Robbie told the crowd. 'All of us feel connected to children.'

Relatives recalled a girl full of love, compassion, charity and enthusiasm. Her father said she loved to pick flowers - 'like a goat'. He finally told her to limit the picking to dandelions.

'Emilie always wanted to help people feel better,' the family said in an obituary. 'Her compassion and 
charity was exemplified with her hugs, the cards she would make, and her
 statement that, "I wish everybody could just be happy".'

Robbie said he was overwhelmed with support from the town and the crowd - many of whom were strangers. He explained how he took one of his daughters on a drive to see pink ribbons in the town.

'I pulled over to show her this one spot 
that I thought was really pretty,' he said. 'I closed my eyes and I
 thought about how many people it took to do that. I thought about 
each hand tying each ribbon.'

Ogden Mayor Mike Caldwell added to the 
family: 'We want to give you the nicest, safest space to put her to 
rest, and for you to return and know this love here will not die.'

After the speeches, the crowd crowd 
moved outside to the football field to light and launch lanterns in 
remembrance of each Sandy Hook victim as 'Amazing Grace' wailed on 
bagpipes.

Robbie Parker launched Emilie’s 
lantern, which was pink one, and spoke in Portuguese, which he had been 
teaching his daughter. 'I love you and you’ll always be with us,' he 
said.

A day after his daughter was killed, Robbie Parker, a 30-year-old physician’s assistant, addressed the media to offer his forgiveness to the family of the gunman.

'I'd like to offer our deepest 
condolences to all the families who were directly affected. It’s a 
horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to them,' he said, choking back 
his tears. 'This includes the family of the shooter, and I want you to 
know that our love and support go out to you as well.'

He
 went on: 'My daughter Emilie would be one of the first ones giving her 
love and support to all of the victims, because that’s the kind of 
person she is.

'As the deep pain begins to settle in our hearts, we find comfort in the incredible person Emilie was and how many people she was able to touch in her short time on Earth.'

He also spoke of Emilie's incredible artistic talent, and how she could often be found carrying crayons, markers, and paper to make colorful cards for those having a dark day.

He continued: 'Emilie’s laughter was infectious, and everyone who met her would agree that the world was a better place because she was in it.'
