A children’s book written for Comic Relief has come under fire for lampooning the Queen and depicting Prince Philip as a drunkard.

The Queen’s Orang-Utan, by Little Britain star David Walliams, was written especially for the charity, with at least £3 from each sale going towards the fund.

But it has been branded ‘well-intentioned but misjudged’ by Royal watchers due to its depictions of the Queen and members of her family.

In the book, published by HarperCollins later this month, Prince Philip is depicted as a red-nosed drunkard, who in one scene pushes the Duchess of Cornwall’s face into a bowl of soup.

Elsewhere, Prince Charles suggests a ‘solid gold diamond-encrusted stair lift’ as a birthday present for the Queen – hinting at a physical fragility that is not the case in reality.

At the climax of the story, Her Majesty gives up her throne – contradicting real life where she has long refused to abdicate.

Though the characters are not named in the book, their identity is clear in the drawings by Tony Ross. And Walliams has clearly set his story in the present day as it features Prince George.

Royal biographer Penny Junor said she had no problem with anyone satirising the Royal Family and believed the Queen had ‘pretty broad’ shoulders, but thought the storyline ‘a bit odd’ as a children’s tale, adding: ‘I think it is well-intentioned but a little misjudged so I would award it two out of ten.’

In one scene, the Queen finds a Prime Minister who looks very much like David Cameron ‘an awful bore’. In another, President George Bush is caricatured in a banquet scene.

Another Royal biographer, Margaret Holder, said the story’s suggestion that the Queen would ever abandon her duties was a ‘complete flight of fancy’, adding: ‘She will never turn her back on her official duties. She has made an oath to devote her whole life to the service of the Commonwealth.’

A spokesman for HarperCollins said: ‘David Walliams’s style is irreverent and fun. The book has been written to benefit Comic Relief and entertain children.’

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
