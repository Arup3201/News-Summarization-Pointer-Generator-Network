Leeds United legend Peter Lorimer has warned Sunderland his former club are out for revenge after being part of the team that lost the 1973 FA Cup final in front of 100,000 fans at Wembley.

The former Scotland midfielder was on the losing end of one of the competition's most memorable upsets as second division Sunderland beat Don Revie's Leeds, the 1972 winners and a first division giant.

Lorimer thought he had equalised when the goal was gaping from six yards out, only for goalkeeper Jim Montgomery to divert the ball on to the crossbar for a save akin to Gordon Banks's against Pele in the 1970 World Cup.

Sunderland 1-0 Leeds United

May 5, 1973 

Wembley, London 

Attendance: 100,000 

Leeds now find themselves the underdogs going into the third round against Sunderland on Sunday, and Lorimer feels they are capable of their own upset.

'Sunderland are hot favourites to beat Leeds,'  Lorimer told the Sunday Mirror. 'But the FA Cup has this wonderful way of throwing up a shock result.

'In that 1973 final we were the shortest-priced favourites there had ever been. We were the team. And we lost. Sunderland, like us now, were a second division side with nothing to lose.

'Although they had some talented players like their captain Bobby Kerr, Billy Hughes and Dave Watson, a future England centre-half.'

So, are you still haunted by that save by Montgomery?

'Wherever I go, there's always a Sunderland fan who reminds me of that,' he continued.

'Jim was the scourge of my life. Don said he was vulnerable from 20 or 30 yards because he had poor eyesight but close in he had terrific reactions and was brilliant in the six-yard box. Don was right.

'If I had that chance again, I wouldn't do anything different. 

'I got a good clean contact, hit the target and somehow Jim knocked it onto the crossbar and saved the day for them.

'Today's players are ­obviously not going to remember that Wembley final but there will be Leeds fans in the crowd who want revenge, even 40 years on.'
