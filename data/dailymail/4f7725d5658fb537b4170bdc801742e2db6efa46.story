A burglar who was freed from prison because he had five children to look after is facing another jail term for assault.

Wayne Bishop carried out the attack just a few weeks after he was controversially let out of prison last year.

In a decision that sparked outrage, Appeal Court judges released him from an eight-month sentence for burglary and dangerous driving because of his ‘human right’ to a family life.

They said it was not in the ‘best interests’ of his five young children for the convicted burglar to be in prison.

Jobless Bishop, who admitted he had ‘never thought’ the judges would free him, claimed at the time that he was ‘going straight’ for the sake of his children.

But just four weeks later he attacked a man in broad daylight after chasing him into a Spar supermarket.

A
court heard yesterday how horrified shoppers looked on as Bishop 
repeatedly punched his victim in the head while his brother held him in a
headlock.

The ‘premeditated’ attack left victim David Parsons with a ‘bruised and swollen’ face, prosecutors said.

Bishop, and his brother, unemployed bouncer Robert Wheelhouse, denied the assault at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

But they were found guilty after a judge saw CCTV of the incident and dismissed their account of events as ‘implausible and untrue’.

Bishop, 34, who has a string of previous convictions, was warned he faces up to six months in prison when he is sentenced next month.

But last night his lawyer said Bishop planned to try to use his children to avoid jail once more.

Solicitor Timothy Holder said: ‘Wayne is still responsible for all his five children. We will be asking the court to take into account his responsibilities towards his childcare duties.’

At the time of the attack, Bishop had just started the 24-month suspended sentence given to him by the Court of Appeal.

CCTV footage of the attack showed 40-year-old Wheelhouse grabbing Mr Parsons, 23, and swinging him around to face Bishop.

After he was arrested, Bishop refused to answer any questions. He also declined to give evidence yesterday.

His brother told the court they had 
gone after Mr Parsons because he had ‘insulted and attacked’ a niece of 
his and Bishop’s. Police however said they had no record of any such 
attack.

Finding the pair 
guilty, District Judge Pyle told Bishop he would be sentenced at 
Nottingham Crown Court so that ‘it can deal with all matters against 
you.’

He said: ‘This assault in itself might
not warrant custody but a crown court will want to know that you are in
breach of a suspended sentence.’

Bishop gained notoriety last May 
after successfully appealing against his eight-month prison sentence for
a burglary at Mansfield Rugby Club.

His legal team argued his imprisonment went against Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention – which enshrines the right to respect for family life.

The decision was condemned by Bishop’s neighbours, who described him as ‘nothing but trouble’.

Bishop, from Clifton, Nottingham, argued at the time that he was the sole carer for his five children – Courteney, 13, Katie, 11, Taylor, nine, Brandon, seven, and Kyle, six – for five nights of the week and they were bereft without him.

Their mother, his ex partner Tracey York, 30, could only have the children at weekends because she worked shifts.

Bishop has previous convictions for shoplifting, driving without a licence or insurance, three convictions for driving while disqualified, and two convictions for threatening behaviour.

He refused to comment as he left court on bail yesterday.
