A judge in Maryland has refused to allowed the mother of two missing toddlers out of a state mental institution so that she can lead police to her children. 

The family of Jacob and Sarah Hoggle, 2 and 3, are furious with the decision by Montgomery County District Court Judge Eugene Wolfe. They believe the toddlers, who were reported missing on September 8, could still be alive and in grave danger. 

Judge Wolfe said Catherine Hoggle, 27, has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and has been ruled not competent to stand trial on charges of abduction, neglect and hindering an investigation. 

Her lawyer argued that it is wrong for authorities to ask Hoggle to take them to her children because she would be incriminating herself, the Washington Post reports.

Catherine Hoggle claims the children are still alive and had said she wanted to lead police to them. However, a judge prevented her from being let out to help authorities

Hoggle has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. She is charged with abduction, child endangerment and hindering an investigation 

Jacob and Sarah's relatives, including her father - Catherine Hoggle's longtime boyfriend - say she is the only one who knows where the children are. 

'It’s infuriating,' Troy Turner told the Post. 

The judge ordered police and prosecutors not to speak to her until she is deemed mentally fit to stand trial - meaning that they can't press her on where Jacob and Sarah are. 

Prosecutors say that Hoggle claimed in phone calls from her mental ward at the state psychiatric hospital that she wanted to lead authorities to her children and that they are still alive. 

Authorities aren't sure whether Hoggle is telling the truth - or even if she is mentally fit to know what she is saying - but they argued that even the smallest chance that she could aid in the rescue of Jacob and Seth makes it worth the effort. 

However, when prosecutors filed a motion asking that Hoggle be allowed out of the hospital to lead police to her children, her defense lawyer stepped in and said that she no longer wants to help police. 

Troy Turner, Hoggle's longtime partner and the father of the two children, says it's 'infuriating' that the judge won't let police have Catherine Hoggle lead them to his toddlers

'What the state is asking the court to order is that she incriminate herself,' attorney David Felsen told the judge, according to the Post.  

Her disappearance with her children from her home in Germantown, Maryland, in September sparked a massive police manhunt. 

She was found days later, but she was not with her children. During a 16-hour interview, she changed her story multiple times but maintained that they were safe.

Two months later, Sarah and Jacob are still missing and authorities have run out of leads.
