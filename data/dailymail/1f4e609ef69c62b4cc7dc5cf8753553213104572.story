A jealous father who murdered his two-year-old daughter by throwing her into a creek while she was still strapped to her car seat, told the girl's mother it would make a great movie, a court heard.

Arthur Morgan is accused of killing Tierra Morgan-Glover in November 2011 after flying into a jealous rage because his ex-partner Imani Benton had refused to get back together with him.

The little girl's body was pulled from a creek about 20 miles from her home in Lakehurst, New Jersey, after a group of children spotted one tiny black and purple sneaker sticking out of the water.

Trial: Arthur Morgan is accused of killing his two-year-old daughter Tierra Morgan-Glover after flying into a jealous rage because his ex-partner Imani Benton had refused to get back together with him

She was found still strapped into 
her pink car seat, which was weighed down with a heavy metal car tire 
jack, which prosecutors said was done to ensure it would sink.

Morgan, 29, was arrested after a week-long manhunt almost 3,000 miles from where his daughter's body was found.

In
 a letter from the San Diego County jail where he was awaiting 
extradition to New Jersey, he told Miss Benton that they were going to 
be famous.

Testifying on the
 second day of Morgan's murder trial at Monmouth County Superior Court, 
Mis Benton read allowed from the letter.

'We're famous, infamous.' she read. 'Don't just let anyone play me in the TV movie. Write the book, baby. I love you.'

Children discovered the two-year-old's body, still strapped into her car seat, at a creek about 20 miles from her home. One tiny black and purple sneaker was sticking out of the water

Morgan
 had seen footage of his daughter's funeral while in jail and wrote in 
the letter that he had seen Miss Benton trip as she left the church.

He
 told her that she had looked good in video but accused her family of 
being abusive towards the girl and that he did not want his daughter 
growing up around people he considered unfit.

'Incest, child rape, drinking. No, no, no. Not my baby. Not our baby,' he wrote.

However
 Judge Anthony Mellaci Jr. refused to let the jury hear details of the 
accusations against the family noting that both sides in the case agreed
 before the trial not to raise the matter.

Benton
 told the court that days before the child's death, she had broken up 
with Morgan and had returned an engagement ring to him.

Morgan's
 letter also said he wished Benton had come with him when he took Tierra
 on the day she died on a court approved visit to see the movie Happy 
Feet 2.

'You should have 
came with us,' Morgan wrote in a portion that was read to the jury. 'It 
would have been so different, I'm sure. That was the plan, to go as a 
family.'

In a letter sent from the San Diego County jail where he was awaiting extradition to New Jersey, Morgan told the girl's mother that they were going to be famous

But Miss Benton 
said that sentence was not an invitation to see a movie â€” his stated 
reason for taking the child on the day she died.

'If I would have went to the movie, we wouldn't have gone to the movie,' she testified. 'We all would have died.'

Breaking
 down in tears, Miss Benton described how she learned of her daughter's 
death, hours after Morgan had angrily sped off with their daughter in 
his car.

Benton said she called police after Morgan was four hours overdue bringing Tierra home.

Eight hours earlier, Benton said, Morgan had berated her, saying she wasn't a good mother and yelling that she was a whore.

Police
 came and took a report but returned hours later, this time with an FBI 
agent who asked about a specific item of clothing Tierra was wearing, a 
pink Hello Kitty hat.

'I 
never told police about the hat,' she testified. 'When they asked, I 
knew something was wrong. I started hyperventilating, I had a panic 
attack and I would end up in the hospital.'

Prosecutors
 said Morgan gave a statement to authorities in San Diego, where he was 
arrested, indicating 'he could have done it that way' when asked if he 
had tossed the child into the creek.

In
 her testimony, Benton described being in a hospital, where an officer 
showed her a photo and asked if she could identify the person in it. The
 photo showed Tierra's lifeless body, her eyes closed, Benton said.

One
 of the items the child was wearing when she left with her father that 
morning was a necklace, Benton testified. It had a pendant that read, 
'Daddy's Little Girl.'

Arthur Morgan III stands in a court room in Freehold, N.J. on the first day of his trial for the murder of his daughter Tierra Morgan-Glover, Wednesday, March 12

Judge Anthony J. Mellaci speaks on the bench during the first day of the Arthur E. Morgan III  trial for who is charged with the murder of his daughter Tierra Morgan-Glover

Jurors
 were shown a video of Morgan and a friend buying a bottle of rum a 
liquor store just minutes after prosecutors say he killed Tierra.

In
 his opening statement, defense attorney Ryan Moriarty indicated Morgan 
would not deny responsibility for Tierra's death but told the jurors 
their task is to decide 'what form of homicide applies to this 
defendant.'

If convicted of 
'knowing and purposeful' murder, Morgan could get life in prison without
 parole. But if convicted of a lesser form of homicide, like reckless 
manslaughter, he could be freed in as little as five years.
