A trainee surgeon launched a passionate defence of the NHS against threat posed by independence, saying she had been spurred into action by the ‘lies’ of Alex Salmond’s SNP.

In a highly-emotional speech at a rally in Glasgow, Vicki Greig, 28, told how her mother had only been able to walk her down the aisle when she tied the knot on Sunday thanks to the expert NHS care she received to treat breast cancer.

Miss Greig condemned SNP claims about the privatisation of the NHS by London were ‘dishonest, unethical and wrong’, and had been made while Mr Salmond was secretly planning £500million in in cuts if he wins independence.

In a highly-charged speech to a Better Together rally in Glasgow, Vicki Greig, 28, told how she had been spurred into speaking out by SNP scare stories about NHS privatisation

Hundreds of No campaigners gathered in the Community Hall in Glasgow today, to hear from political leaders including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, Johann Lamont, Willie Rennie and Ruth Davidson.

But the event was electrified by the deeply personal stories of members of the public who were asked to speak.

Miss Greig told how she is training as an oral surgeon in Glasgow, and of her own personal debt to the NHS for saving her own life, and that of her mother Moira.

‘I was born in an NHS hospital, like most of you here,’ she said. ‘I was in and out of A&E countless times as a child. I was treated in an NHS hospital when I had a heart condition.’  

She said that like most people she has the NHS to thank for ‘saving the life of a loved one’.

She added: ‘My mother was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in 2004.

‘Thanks to the expert care she received on the NHS, and being a part of an experimental drug trial, funded by the NHS, my mum was there to walk me down the aisle, with my father and I, when I got married on Sunday.’

Miss Greig received a standing ovation for her passionate plea for people to vote No in tomorrow's historic referendum

 Miss Greig said her mother Moira would not be alive now were it not for the NHS, and insisted lives were saved because the NHS worked across the UK

Miss Greig married Rolls Royce engineer Ian McNeull, 28, in a humanist ceremony in Aberdeen on Sunday. He has voted Yes in the referendum.

She added: ‘The thing about the NHS we don’t realise just how precious it is until we need it.’

The NHS was rightly celebrated at key moments in national life, including the London Olympics, but it has ‘sadly’ become a major issue of the referendum campaign.

Mr Salmond has claimed that independence is the only way to protect the health service in Scotland from cuts and privatisation imposed by Westminster.

But a leaked report revealed Mr Salmond is planning £450million in cuts if he secures independence.

Tearing into the SNP, Miss Greig added: ‘Let me be absolutely clear, I have never done anything like this in my life.

‘I would not be here today if it wasn’t for the lies I have been told by the SNP. They have been dishonest, they’ve been unethical and they have been wrong.

‘They’ve acted in a way which was in direct contrast with all of my professional values and everything I vowed to uphold when I graduated.

‘They have attempted to manipulate the most vulnerable people in our country, those reliant on the NHS, patients & carers alike by preying on their fears. 

‘They told lies about privatisation to frighten people into voting to leave our friends and family across the UK. 

‘And the whole time they were doing it, they were hiding half a billion pounds of cuts for our NHS. 

‘We deserve better than that. Our vulnerable deserve better than that. Scotland deserves better than that.’

Miss Greig was on the stage at the rally as Gordon Brown set out his passionate defence of the Union yet

Hundreds of people gathered at the Community Hall in Glasgow for the final Better Together rally of the referendum campaign, ahead of tomorrow's vote

To a standing ovation she added: ‘That’s why I’m voting No tomorrow. I’m voting No for a better Scotland. I’m voting No to protect our NHS.’

The future of the NHS has become the central background in the final hours of the campaign, with Better Together accusing Alex Salmond of lying about cuts.

The Yes campaign had claimed that only by voting for independence could Scots protect the health service from an agenda of cuts and privatisation from Westminster.

But analysts revealed how NHS spending has risen in England but fallen in Scotland under Mr Salmond.

A leaked report revealed how the NHS in Scotland faces a £450million financial black hole, with new promises ’not fully funded’.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the rally: The greatest risk to our health and public services isn’t the one posed by independence. 

'The biggest threat to the NHS is not the Union. With their secret plan for half a billion pounds of cuts, it is the SNP. Let’s tell the people of Scotland they are not saving the NHS but using the NHS to save the SNP.

'Let the people of Scotland be clear that the SNP don’t wake up in the morning with a mission to save the NHS, they wake up with a mission to use it to create a separate state.' 

There was a small group of Yes campaigners outside the Community Central Hall, with police guarding the entrance while Mr Brown was in the building

A new hard hitting leaflet aimed from the No campaign states: ’Alex Salmond has LIED to you about the NHS.

’His secret plan to make half a billion pounds of NHS cuts AFTER the referendum has been exposed. The case for separation had been based on a big NHS LIE.’

In her speech, one of five from ordinary voters including a shipbuilder, a pensioner, a 16-year-old schoolgirl and a mother, Miss Greig said she was always going to vote No.

‘I see no reason to take a Union that’s been hugely successful for Scotland and the rest of the UK.

‘It works not just by pooling and sharing our resources across the UK, which secures for the NHS, but it forms a partnership, which means training, research and services are shared.

‘It means lives are shared and care is given, not based on nationality but on need.

‘Every man woman, woman and child across Scotland have access to specialist NHS centres north and south of the border.’
