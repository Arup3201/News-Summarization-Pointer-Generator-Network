Britain's rubbish sent to China for recycling is being returned to UK landfills because the quality is so poor.

Nearly 70 per cent of plastics able to be recycled are shipped to the Far East as UK households fail to re-use and process them at home.

Historically, China accepted it to process the materials.

Waste is being sent back to British landfills after China has rejected low quality plastics

Don't dump it here: China has cracked down on the type and quality of materials it processes

But the country has now clamped down on the low quality of items sent to it - particularly those that have been 'contaminated', the Daily Telegraph reported.

The Environment Agency has warned that in this year alone 17 containers, containing 420 tons of plastic, have been refused by Asian countries as the government cracks down on 'dirty' plastics.

Recycling experts warned of a 'plastics mountain' if China cracks down further, according to the Daily Telegraph.

China announced in October that it may enforce regulations that would spell disaster for Britain in terms of dumping their waste elsewhere.

The regulations ban imported unwashed post-consumer plastic, any waste being transferred to a company other than that stated on the import licence; and stopping the trade of unwashed plastic leftover from the sorting of imported plastic and paper.

Now Beijing has warned that China may stop accepting unwashed, household plastics scrap altogether as it strives to recycle only high quality materials.

Households have not been properly processing their waste, despite efforts to encourage people to make more of an effort

Most local authorities in England do not insist people categorise their rubbish, allowing them to lump all recyclable materials such as plastic and glass into once collection.

Despite this jumble of mixed materials, a recycling facility sorts them - but even this will not meet the standards demanded by the Chinese as bales are often 'contaminated' by households throwing the wrong sort of thing in the recycling bin.

Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said he was aiming to improve Britain’s recycling infrastructure and not rely on outsiders to help with the country processing its waste.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Trade in recyclable materials is a global market and I want to see UK businesses make money from it to help boost our economy.

'I want to see our own recycling industry grow, so we can grasp this opportunity with both hands.'

Despite his statement, figures revealed that millions of tons of household rubbish was burned instead of recycled by councils last year.

The
amount sent to incinerators shot up by almost a quarter -  while the 
amount sent for recycling went up by barely a single percentage point.

The
burning boom means millions of families who have been forced to cope 
with fortnightly collections, rubbish rationing and wheelie bin fines in
the name of saving the environment now have to live with the pollution 
risks of incinerators.

The Guangzhou city in south China’s Guangdong Province is one of the country's most well-known dumping grounds for other nation's rubbish.
