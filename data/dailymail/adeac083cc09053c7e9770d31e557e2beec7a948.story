A convicted paedophile linked to the unsolved murders of four children in the 1970s after a breakthrough in DNA technology has a startling history of sex abuse, court records show.

Arch Edward Sloan, who is serving a life sentence for raping a 10-year-old boy in 1983, has been named in the case of the Oakland County Child Killer, who went on the rampage for 13 months.

Investigators reopened the case into the murders of two girls and the rape and murders of two boys in 2005 and found strands of hair on two of the victims matched a strand found in Sloan's car.

The man, now 70, has refused to cooperate with investigators, but court documents reveal his frightening history of sexual abuse and how his family feared he had an incurable problem.

Sex offender: Arch Edward Sloan is serving a life sentence for raping a 10-year-old boy in 1983. DNA on hair found in his truck has also linked him to four killings in the 1970s

A psychiatrist who evaluated him in the 1980s to determine his competency for trial noted: 'Defendant was only capable of sexual satisfaction with small children,' the Detroit Free Press reported.

Another added: 'Defendant's mental illness made him unable to control his impulses and made him unable to conform his conduct to what he knew was wrong, what he knew was legally required.'

Sloan grew up in Southfield, Michigan and completed his GED while serving a two-and-a-half year sentence for gross indecency between males. He was paroled in 1961.

Between 1970 and the early 1980s, he was found guilty in three other sex assault cases, including charges of sodomy and corrupting the morals of a minor.

Victims: The first victims of the Oakland County Child Killer were Mark Stebbins, 12, who was killed after walking home in January 1976. Jill Robinson, 12, was killed in December 1976

Unsolved: Kristine Mihelich, 10, vanished in January 1977 and was found 19 days later in a ditch. Timothy King, 11, disappeared in March and was also found in a ditch. King and Stebbins were both raped

He was sentenced to life behind bars after a grisly crime on October, 1983 in Detroit, when the 10-year-old son of a co-worker stayed with him so they could go fishing the next day.

Sloan bet the boy he could beat him in a race; if the boy won, he would win a dollar, but if he lost, he had to perform a sex act on Sloan, according to court records. The boy lost and was assaulted.

Later the same night, Sloan gave the child soda and wine and when they went to bed, Sloan made the boy strip and then he raped him, records show.

The next day, he dropped the boy off at a gas station with $5 and told him not to tell anyone what had happened, the Free Press reported.

Sloan's lawyer failed to get him declared mentally incompetent for trial and he was convicted.

Before his trial, his mother Caroline Sloan wrote to the judge, asking: 'I know what Arch did was wrong, but Your Honor, will locking him up in a jail help his problem?'

Search: Police launched a search for the killer and released the drawing and posters in 1977. Sloan worked in the area as a mechanic and agreed to have his car searched, from which police took hairs

Sloan was an early suspect in the murders and rapes of Mark Stebbins and Timothy King and the murders of Kristine Mihelich and Jill Robinson, and allowed officers to search his 1966 Pontiac.

There they found a hair, which was 
stored. Forensic specialists have found the DNA of the hair matched that
of the hairs found on the victims - but did not match Sloan's.

Arch Edward Sloan, who has been linked to the Oakland County Killings in Michigan in the 1970s after a break through in DNA technology, has a frightening criminal past.

1959: Charged with gross indecency in Detroit. Convicted in June and 
sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years in prison. Paroled in 1961.

1970: Convicted in Pennsylvania on charges of sodomy and corrupting the morals of a minor. Sentenced to five to 10 years in prison and paroled in 1975.

1978: Accused in two separate sex assault cases. Convicted with second-degree criminal 
sexual conduct in one and served six months in 1979. Convicted in March 1980 of third-degree 
criminal sexual conduct in second case and sentenced to a year in 
prison.

1983: Sexually assaulted 10-year-old son of a 
co-worker while the boy was staying with him. Sexually abused boy after he lost a 'bet' and fed him wine before raping him. Convicted on two 
counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and sentenced in 1985 to 
life in prison

Officers are now trying to determine what role, if any, he played in the murders. He had two other vehicles and investigators have suggested he might have loaned the car to a friend.

Mark, 12, the child killer's first victim, disappeared February 15, 1976, on his way home from an American Legion hall. His body was found four days later in a shopping centre car park in Southfield.

Timothy, the child killer's last known victim, disappeared March 16, 1977, after leaving a drugstore, where he had gone to buy sweets. His body was found six days later in a ditch in Livonia.

Investigators found a single strand of human hair on Mark's clothing. That hair matched the DNA profile of two hairs found in Timothy's underpants and in his nasal cavity.

The person behind the killings is believed to have killed at least two other children.

Jill Robinson, 12, of Royal Oak, 
disappeared after leaving home following an argument with her mother on 
December 22, 1976, and was found four days later on the side of a road.

Kristine Mihelich, 10, of Berkley, vanished after buying a magazine at a 7-Eleven store on January 2, 1977. She was found 19 days after she disappeared in a ditch in Franklin.

Jill died of a shotgun blast to the head; the other children were suffocated. Their killings were linked due to their proximity and white animal hair found on all four victims.

The killings horrified Detroit 
parents. At the time, residents phoned in thousands of tips to a hastily
mobilised, 200-member task force led by the State Police.

Suspect: Christopher Busch was named by another suspect as the killer. He pleaded guilty to other abuse and killed himself in 1978. Officers found the picture, right, in his room and agreed it looked like Stebbins

Match: James Gunnels, 47, was an alleged abuse victim of Busch and police believe he may have assisted him in the killings. His mitrochondrial DNA matches a hair found on Kristine

Investigators
eventually released a composite sketch of a man who was seen standing 
near Timothy and a blue American Motors Corp. Gremlin before King 
disappeared.

Police questioned and polygraphed many suspects, but never made an arrest. The task force shut down in December 1978 after exhausting its $2 million budget.

One suspect was sex offender Christopher Busch, who was named by another suspect as the killer. When he committed suicide in 1978, police found a drawing on his wall that looked like Stebbins.

In March 2009, the FBI found that that mitochondrial DNA from James Gunnels, a 47-year-old 
parolee, matched the DNA from a hair fragment found on Kristine's body.

Although a mitochondrial DNA match isn't
as precise as a nuclear DNA match, the FBI said the findings were significant. Gunnels said he did not know how it got there and was not charged.

The families of the victims said they were encouraged by the matches.

'I
think this is the best and biggest piece of evidence in the case so 
far,' said Christopher King of Pleasant Ridge, Timothy King's brother.

King said he thinks Sloan must be considered a suspect or person of interest because the hair was found in his vehicle.

On Wednesday, a judge ordered prosecutors to hand over a list of evidence they have in the case to Barry King, the father of Timothy King.

King wants to know why Busch was not investigated further, after a friend told police he had killed Mark Stebbins. Busch passed a polygraph test after denying.

Armed with the new DNA information, investigators said the task force is asking that anyone who knows Sloan or who may have borrowed the car back in the mid-1970s to come forward.

'Finding anyone like this who turns out to be the donor of the hair may be the key to solving these two murders,' Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper said.
