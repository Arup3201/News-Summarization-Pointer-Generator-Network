Call to action: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell addresses the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual policy conference at the Washington Convention Center

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said the U.S. should use overwhelming military force against Iran if American intelligence shows that Tehran has decided to build a nuclear weapon, or it has started to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level.Senator McConnell, of Kentucky, said President Barack Obama's repeated pronouncement that the administration keeps 'all options on the table' is a talking point, not a policy, and the U.S. needed a straightforward deliberate plan that would force Tehran to negotiate to preserve its survival. Senator McConnell was making the case for his proposal in a speech to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee, shortly before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to address the gathering.

'If Iran, at any time, begins to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level, or decides to go forward with a weapons program, then the United States will use overwhelming force to end that programme,' McConnell said.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and 
National Intelligence Director James Clapper told Congress last month 
that Tehran has not made a decision on whether to proceed with 
development of an atomic bomb amid growing fears of its disputed nuclear
weapons program and the possibility of an Israeli attack that could 
lead to a Mideast conflagration.

Prior to private talks with Mr Netanyahu
yesterday, Mr Obama said the U.S. and Israel agree that diplomacy
is the best way to resolve the crisis. But Mr Netanyahu also said Israel 
must remain 'the master of its fate.'

Senator McConnell said that if U.S. 
intelligence, at any time, informs Congress that Iran has begun to 
enrich uranium to weapons-grade standards or decided to develop a 
nuclear weapon, he would consult with the President and the joint 
congressional leadership on legislation authorising the use of American 
military force.

Congress has not voted on such a 
resolution since October 2002 when it gave President George W. Bush the 
authority to use military force against Iraq. Republicans and Democrats 
on Capitol Hill have been unified in pushing hard for sanctions against 
Tehran, including the latest round of penalties targeting Iran's Central
Bank, but a vote on using military force would test a war-weary 
Congress and any bipartisanship.

McConnell said the authorization for 
U.S. military against Iran would make clear that if Iran or its proxies 
retaliate against the United States or its interests, they would face an
overwhelming response.

Mr Netanyahu handed President Obama a gift on Monday that spoke volumes about Israel’s tensions with Iran - an ancient Hebrew tome about a Persian plot to annihilate Jews.

The Scroll Of Esther is a tale of palace intrigue, featuring a Jewish beauty who charms a Persian king into foiling an evil adviser’s genocidal plans for her people some 2,500 years ago.

An Israeli official said Mr Netanyahu told Mr Obama: 'Then too, they wanted to wipe us out.'
