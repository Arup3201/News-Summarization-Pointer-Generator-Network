Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Roy Hodgson a major boost by training with a ball for the first time since tearing his medial knee ligament.

The England flyer began ball work during the national team's training session in the Arena de Amazon on Friday evening.

Oxlade-Chamberlain damaged right knee ligaments during the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami last Wednesday.

The Arsenal midfielder feared his World Cup would be over, but England have since learned that it was only a minor grade one tear.

Instead his rehabilitation is almost complete and Hodgson believes he is in contention for Thursday's Group D clash with Uruguay.
