SpaceX has said that it will dominate travel services in the entire solar system within 100 years.

The comments came from president, Gwynne Shotwell, during a radio interview in which she said the Californian private firm will make the human race ‘multiplanetary.’

By 2100, Ms Shotwell said the company will be the ‘most widely used space transport company in the... let's call it the solar system.’

The comments came from SpaceX president, Gwynne Shotwell (pictured), during a radio interview in which she said SpaceX will make the human race ‘multiplanetary.’ By 2100, Ms Shotwell said the company will be the ‘most widely used space transport company in the... let's call it the solar system'

In an interview with Marketplace radio, Ms Shotwell told host Ben Johnson that in as little as ten years, SpaceX could be sending people to Mars.

‘This is going to sound strange, but from my perspective, it’s risk management to ensure that humans can go somewhere else if there is a huge disaster on Earth,’ she said.

Ms Shotwell added that she wants to do the same thing for space travel that planes are currently doing for air travel by creating ‘rapid and reusable’ rockets.

The comments follow owner Elon Musk’s announcement that SpaceX is making ‘progress’ towards establishing a colony on the red planet by 2020 with tickets to cost $500,000 (£296,900).

Musk has previously said he created SpaceX for the sole reason of developing rocket technology to get people to Mars.

Billionaire Elon Musk, pictured left with Nasa's Charles Boden, has announced his SpaceX firm is making 'progress' towards establishing a colony on the red planet by 2020 - and expects to sell tickets for $500,000 (£296,900) a trip

Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, wants to help establish a colony of up to 80,000 people on the planet, but admitted he’d like to start small, with a group of 10 people, and build the colony from there.

He ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket, fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane, to reach the red planet in six years.

It would need to be much heavier than SpaceX’s current rockets, including the Falcon Heavy that is currently in development and is expected to launch by the end of this year.

SpaceX has a $1.6bn contract with Nasa for a series of future supply missions and this will be used to test his technology further.

Musk ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane to reach the red planet - and he aims to get there three years before the Mars One colony arrive

‘At Mars, you can start a self-sustaining civilisation and grow it into something really big,’ Musk said.

‘I think we're making some progress in that direction - not as fast as I'd like.’

SpaceX also recently released a video of its Falcon 9 rocket making a soft ocean splashdown, describing the reusability test a success.

The rocket was the first stage of a Falcon 9 that launched on 14 July, which took six Orbcomm satellites into orbit.

An on-board camera captured the descent, and the data gathered during the trip by SpaceX will improve the landing on upcoming flights.

This test confirms that the Falcon 9 booster is able consistently to re-enter from space at hypersonic velocity, restart main engines twice, deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity,’ SpaceX said in a news release.

Later this year SpaceX plans to attempt to land one of its Falcon 9 rockets on a floating barge. The ultimate goal is to build reusable rockets that can return from space. Pictured is the Grasshopper test rocket, which SpaceX has been using to perform 'hops' up to low altitudes and practice landing on solid ground

Its ultimate goal is to make the rockets reusable and have them touch down on land.

The company currently has a $1.6bn contract with Nasa for a series of future supply missions and this will be used to test his technology further.

Musk ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane to reach the red planet - and he aims to get there three years before the Mars One colony arrive.

Mars One was set up by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp who plans to take 40 people to the planet with training starting in 2018, and the first passengers arriving in 2023.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has grand plans for his space agency. With help from Nasa he has grown the company significantly in a decade. It is now capable of taking cargo to the ISS with its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket and, beginning possibly in the next few years, the company will take humans into space
