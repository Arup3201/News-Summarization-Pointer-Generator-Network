London art students have designed a bike helmet made from old newspapers to provide cheap and accessible head protection for people using Boris Bikes to navigate the capital.

The students, from the Royal College of Art, hope that their disposable and eco-friendly helmets will one day be available in vending machines and shops close to Boris bike stations.

The paper-mache hats cost just £1 to produce and is waterproof for six hours, but it is not known how effective it would be in a collision.

A group of students has come up with a design to make bike helmets out of London newspapers - at a cost of just £1 to produce

The students came up with the idea after noticing the number of discarded newspapers around the capital and decided that recycled paper, converted into paper mache, 
would be the most practical material for their disposable helmets

The students came up with the idea after noticing the number of discarded newspapers around the capital and decided that recycled paper, converted into paper mache, would be the most practical material for their disposable helmets.

Tom Gottelier, 25, Bobby Petersen, 28 and Edward Thomas, 25, began thinking about the safety of London cyclists having noticed people spontaneously using Boris bikes never carried head protection.

In their design, the discarded newspaper is turned into pulp mixed with adhesive and pigment before it is vacuum formed and heated to resemble the shape of helmet.

Straps can then be slotted into the grooves on the helmet's criss-crossed top before being fastened under the chin.

The designers say these helmets can withstand a significant amount of pressure and hope that one day they will be available in vending machines and nearby shops next to Boris bike stations as well as locations such as New York where the idea has recently been rolled out to mixed reviews.

Each helmet will cost under £1 to produce, will comply with En 10789 safety standards and, by using the same eco additive used to produce NHS wash bowls, will be fully waterproof for in excess of six hours.

However they have not been tested in a collision.

Designer Tom Gottelier said: 'The idea to
use paper pulp came about through standing around on tube platforms, 
sitting in buses and trains watching Metro and Evening Standard 
newspapers blow around.

'We had previously seen what kind of structural integrity could be gained from moulding paper pulp and it seemed like a logical step to use this vast resource that currently circulates our public transport network.

'Unlike the recycling of newspapers into new newspaper, which requires a lot of energy and bleaching in order to get the paper white enough again to print on, making helmets requires no artificial additives.'

The students said that by using the same waterproofing agent as used to make paper pulp wash bowls and buckets as well as natural dyes, they can produce the recyclable and biodegradable helmets for under £1, using very little energy.

Straps can then be slotted into the grooves on the helmet's criss-crossed top before being fastened under the chin, as pictured. The designers say these helmets can withstand a significant amount of pressure

Mr Gottelier said: 'Our current helmets are 2mm thick which already provides an amazing amount of strength and impact absorption, but the next prototype we are working on with an industrial partner we will be able to produce a helmet that is 9mm thick.

'Our overriding concept for the helmet is for it to be distributed in conjunction with the Barclays Bike hire scheme, with the price include in the hire of the bike.

'We agree that people should have a choice to use a helmet, but we do believe from the research that we have gathered that you are much better of wearing one, even if its 25 per cent more effective than not wearing one.

'Twenty five per cent is something all of us would like to take. We believe that if the helmet is included in the price of the hire people are more likely to wear it.'
