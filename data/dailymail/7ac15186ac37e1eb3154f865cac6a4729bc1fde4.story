Trekking trip: Mother-of-two Debra Wilding, 49, was with a team of 12 hikers from the UK

The grieving husband of a British woman who died after falling ill during a trekking trip to Everest praised her last night as a ‘lovely’ person who was ‘doing what she wanted to do’.

Mother-of-two Debra Wilding was with a team of 12 hikers from the UK - including her daughter - when she began to feel unwell after a trip to the Everest base camp.

The 49-year-old started to have trouble breathing and spent the night at a hotel in Khumjung with her daughter, Hannah, 23, while en route to the Nepalese capital Kathmandu.

But Mrs Wilding, from Ulverston, Cumbria, who was married to finance director Ian, was found dead in the hotel on Monday.

Mr Wilding said: ‘For the family this is the most difficult thing we have ever had to go through. We are finding it hard but are being very supportive of each other.’

The 52-year-old added: ‘She was the oldest person in the group and a very determined lady. I know when she's suffering she just ploughs on through - she grits her teeth and fights on.

‘Deb had done lots of training on the fells here in Cumbria - walking, running and cycling, so her fitness level was generally very good.

‘But the starting point of this trek was over three times as high as the highest mountain in Cumbria, and from there went up by another 2,000 metres (6,500ft) to get to Everest Base Camp.

‘She was doing what she wanted to do. It had been a dream for a long time and she'd been planning it for a year and had done all the right preparation. It's just so sad it has ended the way that it has.’

Mrs Wilding’s body has been airlifted to Kathmandu’s Teaching Hospital for a post-mortem examination, with officials saying she may have suffered from altitude sickness.

Local police official Purushottam Silwal said: 'She possibly died of altitude sickness. Her body was airlifted to Kathmandu for a post mortem.' 

The Everest base camp where she fell ill is 17,700ft (5,364 metres) above sea level.

The couple, who also have a 14-year-old daughter, moved to their £500,000 four-bedroom house in Cumbria five years ago having visiting the Lake District regularly for a number of years.

Mr Wilding said: ‘It's been a terrible shock. When you are about 50 you think you've got many more years together and living in such a beautiful part of the world where there is so much to enjoy.

‘We were looking forward to 20 or 30 years of walking the hills and enjoying the Lakes. You don't expect it to stop so abruptly and with no warning.

‘There's really nothing that can comfort you after the shock of losing such a lovely person, so popular and with so many good friends.’

Altitude sickness is caused when people ascend too quickly into areas where there is decreased atmospheric pressure. Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, dizziness and nausea.

People with more severe forms can suffer from breathlessness, even when resting, and are advised to seek immediate medical attention because it can be fatal.

Everest: A Foreign Office spokesman said they were aware of the death of a British national in Nepal and say they are providing consular assistance

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Nepal on October 6, 2014. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

October is peak trekking season in the Himalayas and Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains.

Earlier this year, hundreds of climbers abandoned plans to ascend Mount Everest after 16 Nepalese guides were killed in an avalanche in April.

The Sherpa people are one of the main ethnic groups in Nepal's alpine region, and many make their living as climbing guides on Everest and other Himalayan peaks.

More than 4,000 climbers have reached the summit of Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. Hundreds have also died trying.
