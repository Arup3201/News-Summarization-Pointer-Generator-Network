In true Clarkson style, the sat nav features the presenter barking: ¿Turn right. Turn RIGHT. You missed it! For the love of ¿!¿

The BBC has made a humiliating U-turn after breaking its own editorial guidelines in the marketing of a satnav system voiced by Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson.

Bosses at BBC Worldwide, the Corporation’s commercial arm, were so keen to rush out the gadget in time for Christmas that they forgot to check their own rules, which dictate that the programme must not promote or endorse any motoring products.

Halfords had signed a deal with the BBC and satnav specialist TomTom to stock the product, which costs £180. Some 54,000 are already on the shelves, but once the existing devices have sold out, no more will be produced.

BBC Worldwide will now donate the proceeds to Children In Need.

In true Clarkson style, the sat nav features the presenter barking: ‘Turn right. Turn RIGHT. You missed it! For the love of …!’

He told The Sunday Times: ‘It is mostly about the tone of voice I use.

‘There’s a tone of voice I use when 
ordering people to do things, so, “I said left, left, I said left”, you 
know, that kind of thing.

‘It’s not a gentle sat nav voice, put it like that.’

Putting the brakes on: TomTom had already produced 54,000 sat navs featuring Clarkson's voice before the deal had to be scrapped

Actor Brian Blessed is one of the latest celebrities to lend his voice to sat navs following a Facebook campaign.  

TomTom will also let you download John Cleese, Billy Connolly and Star Wars characters Darth Vader, Yoda and C3PO.

Comedian Eddie Izzard has recorded directions in his trademark rambling style, and gravel-voiced Bob Dylan admitted he was considering following suit, before concluding: ‘I always end up at one place — on Lonely Avenue.’

According to the BBC’s conflict of interest rules, presenters ‘must take particular care not to endorse any product or service which could be covered in the programmes on which they work'.

Clarkson, who was not involved in setting up the deal, will not receive any money from the sales. 

A BBC Worldwide spokesman confirmed the U-turn, and said additional charitable donations would be made by TomTom.

He added: 'Launch plans were too advanced to prevent the physical product going on sale in retail outlets', by the time the problem was identified.

A source said the costs in terms of compensation to TomTom incurred by BBC Worldwide had been 'negligible'.

It is understood the electronics firm will talk to Worldwide about further voice deals.

Halfords has exclusive rights to sell the product which was launched last week.

A spokesman said: 'We are disappointed with the decision by the BBC on behalf of our customers who told us they loved the product. It was proving hugely popular.

'While we have plenty of stock at the moment we will not be able to replace them when they are gone, so the strident tones of voice of Mr Clarkson will be appearing in Halfords for a limited time only and after that he will be silenced, at least on a sat nav.'

The Go Live Top Gear edition had a Stig mode, which rendered the device instantly silent, Clarkson's direction and selected points of interest including race tracks and locations relating to the series.
