If you've ever been told that someone laughing behind your back is only jealous of you, they may well have been wise words.

A study has found that some of us take pleasure in other people's misfortune because it is a natural human response to envy.

By monitoring people's cheek muscles, scientists at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School found that people tend to smile more when someone they envy encounters difficulties - an emotion known as 'Schadenfreude'.

Pleasure or pity: We'd be more likely to take pleasure in someone falling off their bike if we knew they were successful and we envied them

Delight at others' misfortune: Scientists monitored participants cheek muscles to see if they smiled at certain scenarios

The study was inspired by intense sports rivalries, with researchers wanting to find out more about why we revel so much in the failures of our rival teams.

Susan FIske, co-author of the study, said: 'Jealousy and envy are highly correlated. When we ask people on surveys who is envied in American society, they report the same groups: objects of jealousy.

'This is all very much based on stereotypes. And so, in this study, we sought to better understand who is among these envied groups and whether that envy and jealousy elicits a harmful response.'

Participants were shown photographs of individuals associated with different stereotypes: the elderly (pity), students or Americans (pride), drug addicts (disgust) and rich professionals (envy).

These images were then paired with everyday events such as: 'Won five dollars' (positive) or 'Got soaked by a taxi' (negative) or 'Went to the bathroom' (neutral).

Participants were asked how this would make them feel, and their facial movements were recorded.

Ms Fiske said: 'Because people don't like to report envy of Schadenfreude, this was the best method for gathering such responses.

'And, in this experiment, we were able to viscerally capture malicious glee.

'We found that people did smile more in response to negative than positive events, but only for groups they envied.'

A second experiment, monitored the brain to see if participants were willing to harm certain groups and shown the same photographs.

Participants tended to feel most positive when bad things happened to the rich professional.

A follow up test to see if they would be willing to inflict harm on another person found that people were willing to hurt an 'envy target'.

Finally, researchers used various scenarios regarding an investment banker as an example, to gain a response.

The researchers threw information that betrayed steroetypes at participants.

For example, in one article, the banker was himself, employed and status quo. In another, he was advising clients pro-bono (eliciting pride).

In the next, he was using his work bonuses to buy drugs (disgust) and, finally, he was unemployed but still dressing to go to work (pity).

Again, the findings matched earlier experiments â€“ participants rated the articles associated with disgust and envy with less warmth than the pride or pity scenarios.

Ms Fiske said: 'This experiment shows that the dimensions predicting envy are high status and competition, and, when you move those around, the envy goes away.

'This is consistent with the story about who gets envied and why. A lot of it is tied into money because that's an easy thing to look at.'

Rivalry: The study examined how fans of Boston Red Sox (pictured) and New York Yankees felt about the successes and misfortunes of their rival teams

The researchers then applied their experiment to sports rivalry, taken fans from Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees and showing them a game between the two.

Naturally, fans took most pleasure when seeing their own team do well.

When a third neutral team was introduced into the equation, fans showed little reaction whatsoever to their fortunes.

But they were happy when their rival team lost to the neutral team - showing pure Schadenfreude, according to researchers.
