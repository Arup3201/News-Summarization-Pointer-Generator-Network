You might not want to try to pop a wheelie while riding this incredible contraption, a 44ft bicycle that has been created by Indonesian villagers out of rusting iron pipe.

It seats just one person and was hand crafted out of 84 feet of piping in Blawe village, Kediri, in East Java.

The bicycle has been officially recorded by the Indonesian Record Museum after it beat the previous holder by eight feet.

Pedal power: Villagers in Kediri, Indonesia, have built a 44ft bicycle out of scrap metal. It seats just one rider

Record-breaker: The bike is officially Indonesia's longest, although it falls well short of the world record

But despite breaking the Indonesian title, this effort has a long way to go before it beats the world record.

That is held by Mijl van Maers Werkploeg, who built one measuring a whopping 117ft 5in long on August 5, 2011 in Maarheeze in the Netherlands.

To qualify as the longest true bicycle, the Dutchman's creation could have only two wheels and no stabilisers. The bicycle was operated by two people, one steering at the front and one pedalling at the back.

Manoeuvre: The bicycle is so large a small team of people is needed to move it into position
