One in every four pounds collected in council tax in the last year has gone to funding local government pensions in England.

Of the £22.4billion handed over by families in council tax in England in 2012-13, some £5.7billion went towards paying for council workers’ pensions.

More than half of all council tax revenue collected in Scotland went on local government pensions in 2011-12.

Uncertain future: Pensions expert Michael Johnson claims the figures are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable

Scottish councils paid £1billion in employer contributions for local government pensions, yet they collected just £1.9billion in council tax.

The figures, unveiled by pensions expert Michael Johnson, are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable, he said.

In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, he warned that high costs and lax governance are corroding the pension scheme for council workers.

This would ultimately end with council taxpayers or the Treasury being landed with the liabilities for paying pensions.

Mr Johnson told the Mail: ‘The implications of how much is spent on pensions out of the council tax collected are enormous. There is going to be an absolute societal schism in the years ahead when you compare the average public sector worker to the average private sector worker.

‘The public sector worker’s benefits will on average be three times more than what the private sector employee gets.’

Unlike other public sector schemes, employees do contribute to the Local Government Pension Schemes.

Huge disparity: For city of London council workers the administration management costs are £317.30 compared to just £7.60 in West Yorkshire

But an ageing population and a public sector pay freeze has eroded the value of those contributions.

Experts predict that within three years the scheme will run out of cash. The weakest funds were already selling off assets just to bankroll existing pensioners.

‘With no realistic prospect of recovery, they are probably in a death spiral, heading to an unfunded status,’ Mr Johnson said.

He warned that the ‘ultimate liability will probable fall on council taxpayers’. There was also a ‘quiet assumption … that one day, the Treasury will step in’.

‘Successive governments, irrespective of political hue, have, for decades, acted with irresponsible abandon when making provision for their own staff’s pensions. Pension promises have historically been worth roughly 35 per cent of salary, yet contributions have been only around 21 per cent: pure Madoff economics,’ he said, referring to the pyramid scheme which has been described as the biggest financial fraud of all time.

Mr Johnson’s report highlighted the massive disparities in administration management costs: £13.70 in Nottinghamshire per member compared to £119.40 in Durham.

Fund management costs were even more varied with City of London council workers paying £317.30 each compared to £7.60 in West Yorkshire.

Mr Johnson called for some of the 101 pension schemes to be merged into several regional ones.

The also queried why councils were paying so much to fund managers to actively invest their money when studies showed they provided little value when compared to ‘passive’ investments.

The Mail understands that ministers and senior civil servants are closely scrutinising his recommendations.

A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘The problems identified in this report are already being addressed and many of the suggested reforms are underway and well advanced.

‘The LGPS is one of the lowest cost pension schemes in the country and we will continue to work very hard to improve performance and value for both taxpayers and pension fund members. The steps we are taking to make it possible to compare costs and performance between funds, and make merging easier for those funds that chose to do so, will secure the long-term viability of the scheme.

‘We are in the middle of a formal call for evidence on the future structure of the LGPS which is considering a number of issues including the size of funds, investment strategy, deficit management and cash-flow. That will result in a formal consultation early in the new year.’
