The Winter Olympics have hit their toughest obstacle yet - a big burning ball of gas.

Sunny weather in the Russian resort of Sochi has melted ski and snowboard runs, leaving huge patches of grass exposed and making the athletes' intricately-prepared runs treacherous.

For those with time on their hands, however, the heat is good news - with Britain's first ever medallist on the snow Jenny Jones catching some well-deserved rays.

Paradise: Today was a beautiful day in Sochi - but not for athletes, who struggled to cope with the warm weather as it melted ski and snowboard runs. Pictured is the sun setting over the Olympic cauldron

That's better! Fresh from winning bronze, Britain's first ever on the snow, athlete Jenny Jones tweeted a photo of herself with snowboarder Ben Kilner, saying: 'Enjoying a wee "bronzing" moment in the sun'

What Winter Olympics? Spectators took a break in Sochi to enjoy bright blue skies on the beach and sit under palm trees - while ski runs melt and athletes complain that conditions could soon become dangerous

The British athlete relaxed on a deck chair with shirtless fellow British athlete, snowboarder Ben Kilner, and tweeted: Enjoying a wee 'bronzing' moment in the sun with team mate @benkilner #sochi #mountainvillage.'

Residents and visitors at the Winter Olympics resorts have been stripping off on the beach and frolicking in the Black Sea.

Innsbruck (1976) - 7 degrees

Others have worn sunglasses and shorts 
while they lay sunbathing under palm trees - with the mercury set to 
rise even higher, to 17 degrees, over the next two days.

Meanwhile
 the athletes, who are used to training in below-freezing temperatures, 
had to shield themselves from the sun and make sometimes severe changes 
to their technique.

Ski jumpers
 face injury in softened landing areas while many of the sliding events 
like curling have been held at night to stop the ice being melted as 
fast.

Meanwhile those who rely on extravagant tricks for their sport, like snowboarders, are floundering as they struggle on their courses.

One Alpine skiing race track had training suspended in a bid to preserve as much snow as possible for today's event.

Olympics authorities in Russia have reservoirs of snow packed away near the mountain venues yet dismissed calls for it to be used, claiming it was not needed.

Dmitry
 Chernyshenko, head of the local organising committee, told journalists: 'It's not a big surprise for us.
 We're a subtropical city'.

The top temperature in Sochi today was 15 degrees celsius, warmer than all 10 of the last Winter Olympics host cities and six of the last 10 Summer Olympics cities.

It has led the Games at the Russian resort - famously warmer and more humid than most of the country - to be nicknamed the Warmer or subtropical Olympics, with some people questioning why the Games were held there in the first place.

The hastag #ColderThanSochi has begun 
trending on Twitter as armchair athletes from around the world compare 
conditions on their TV sets to what they can see out the window.

The
 coldest of the last 20 host cities today was Montreal at a top 
temperature of minus 10 - with only Barcelona, Los Angeles, Athens and 
Sydney warmer than Sochi.

Get the shades on: Spectators carried their coats as they walked into the Olympic park. An official dismissed calls to pipe in stockpiled snow for the mountain venues, saying: 'It's no surprise... we're a subtropical city'

Whew! Kaylee Weil, from San Diego, California, takes a drink of water while walking through the Olympic Park wearing a sun dress today. The heat is set to increase over the next few days to 17 degrees celsius

Lazing about: The hot weather has not been the best news for winter sportsmen as it ruins months of training

London,
 which enjoyed a heat wave as it hosted the Summer Olympics in 2012, was
 five degrees colder than Sochi today while 1980 Summer Olympics city 
Moscow was a full 12 degrees colder.

Austrian ski jumper Wilhelm Denifl said: 'Holes and ruts
 form if the snow on the landing zone is not hard enough... The snow becomes unstable, 
and if we are landing consistently in the same area, and at a high 
speed, the pressure associated with landing can make it unstable. And 
dangerous.'

U.S. Alpine ski racer Bode 
Miller went from being a pre-race favourite during training runs down an icy hill
 to an eighth-place finisher when the downhill course got slushier on Sunday.

He said: 'It would be a 
tough call to be like, "The weather is changing, we're just going to go 
completely throw a dart in the dark and hope it hits." We had to stick 
with what we knew.

'In hindsight, it was a mistake, 
because on training day, it was boilerplate ice and you needed a lot of 
edge. And on race day, you needed to be more subtle, more smooth'

Cooling off: Construction workers took a dip on a break from work as temperatures hit 15 degrees celsius

Summer sport: Several men went fishing on the beach at Sochi, just a few yards from the Olympic Park

Poor timing: London, which enjoyed a heat wave as it hosted the Summer Olympics in 2012, was five degrees colder than Sochi today while 1980 Summer Olympics city Moscow was a full 12 degrees colder

Hardy: Perhaps Russians are more accustomed to cold weather, but athletes have also complained

Outdoor
 sports have always been at the mercy of the weather. Training for a pre-Olympic World Cup weekend in St. Moritz, Switzerland, had to be cancelled while fog forced 
the cancellation of the last men's downhill race before Sochi.

That race had already 
moved from Germany because of a lack of snow.

Women's races, meanwhile, shifted from
 one resort in Slovenia to another because there wasn't enough snow - 
only to have rain and fog wipe out a giant slalom at the new spot.

And it may have been warmer than every other Winter Olympics host city today in Sochi, but they have not been without there problems either.

Four years ago races were delayed by warm weather in Whistler, British Columbia, while at Turin, Italy, in 2006 the women's super-G was postponed 24 hours. Skiing in Nagano, Japan, had to wait for two days in 
1998 and at Sarajevo in 1984, 
both downhill races were postponed.

Idyll: The beach next to Sochi's Olympic stadium today. The Winter Games in Whistler, Turin, Nagano and Sarajevo were all affected by warmer-than-expected weather. The February average for Sochi is 10 degrees

ALPINE SKIING: Cold keeps the snow 
along the course icier and therefore more compact and slick. Softer snow means it's easier to make turns, but also slows down the skiers, tempting them to take more risks and be more aggressive otherwise they can't build up enough speed.

HALFPIPE:
 Riders call the slush 'mashed potatoes' and it slows them
 down, making it harder to get enough air to pull off flips and 
twists. Conditions must be as perfect as possible and start slipping when the temperature gets anywhere above freezing.

SLOPESTYLE:
 The firmer the snow surface, the better it is for slopestyle skiers and
 snowboarders, because it gives the athletes a firmer takeoff and more time in the air.

SNOWBOARDCROSS:
 Soft snow can slow down the cars and turn races into more strategy as speed, which could make things more interesting for the viewers if not the athletes.

SKI
 JUMPING: Athletes risk injury when the artificial snow in the landing area is heated by the sun. Their landings
 become bumpy, which can throw competitors off-balance and make them 
fall. Also, their skis could dig too far into the snow. The ramp itself 
is kept cool by a refrigeration
 unit.

CROSS COUNTRY 
AND BIATHLON: Courses become treacherous in the downhill
 curves, where it's easy to lose one's balance at high speed on thin 
skis. Skiers adjust the amount of wax on their skis and can change the setup several times a day.

SLIDING
 SPORTS: Many of the sliding competitions are being held at night for lower temperatures. Miles of pipe installed in tracks pump temperature-controlled ammonia 
through the concrete, keeping the surface cold enough during the day. Shades installed on the track's roof also 
shield the ice from the sun, and workers spray dry ice and water.Source: AP
