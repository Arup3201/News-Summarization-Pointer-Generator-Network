Two BP employees will plead guilty to manslaughter charges relating to the deaths of 11 people on the doomed Deepwater Horizon oil rig that spawned the catastrophic oil disaster in 2010.

A federal indictment unsealed in New Orleans today claims BP well site leaders Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine acted negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the rig before the explosion.

The indictment says Kaluza and Vidrine failed to phone engineers onshore to notify them of problems in the drilling operation.

Tragedy: Eleven workers were killed when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sparked the worst oil disaster in American history

Paying up: BP also agreed to pay the largest fine in U.S. history - a total of $4.5billion settlement with authorities for claims relating to the spill

Victims: Aaron Dale Burkeen, 37, pictured left, and Karl Kleppinger Jr, right, were among the dead

Blame: Two BP supervisors are now being held accountable for the deaths of the men on the Deepwater Horizon rig, including Jason Anderson, left, and Gordon Jones, right

The men who lost their lives on the rig 
were Jason C. Anderson, 35; Aaron Dale Burkeen, 37; Donald Clark, 49; 
Stephen Ray Curtis, 39; Roy Wyatt Kemp, 27; Karl D. Kleppinger Jr., 38; 
Gordon L. Jones, 28; Keith Blair Manuel, 56; Dewey A. Revette, 48; Shane
M. Roshto, 22, and Adam Weise, 24.

Another indictment charges David 
Rainey, who was BP's vice president of exploration for the Gulf of 
Mexico, on charges of obstruction of Congress and false statements.

The indictment claims the former 
executive lied to federal investigators when they asked him how he 
calculated a flow rate estimate for BP's blown-out well in the days 
after the April 2010 disaster.

The Britain-based oil giant also 
agreed to pay the largest fine in U.S. history - a total of $4.5billion 
settlement with authorities for claims relating to the spill.

Legal fight: Attorney General Eric Holder said the $4.5billion settlement and indictments aren't the end of federal authorities' efforts and that the criminal investigation against BP is continuing

At a news conference today, Attorney 
General Eric Holder called BP 'largest total criminal resolution in the 
history of the United States.'

He added that the settlement and indictments aren't the end of federal authorities' efforts and that the criminal investigation against BP is continuing

BP
will pay the fine over six years after reaching a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) that has seen it plead guilty to 14 criminal charges 
relating to the oil rig accident in 2010, which dumped millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

Lives cut short: Donald Clark left behind a wife after the explosion, while Keith Blair Manuel, right, had three children

Loss: At 22, Shane Roshto was the youngest victim of the disaster

Tainted: The explosion caused the spill of more than 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico

'We believe this resolution is in the best interest of BP and its shareholders,' said Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP chairman.

'It removes two significant legal risks and allows us to vigorously defend the company against the remaining civil claims.'

The settlement, which is subject to 
approval by a federal judge, includes payments of nearly $2.4 billion to
the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, $350million to the National
Academy of Sciences and about $500million to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said: 'We apologize for our role in the accident and as today's resolution with the U.S. government further reflects, we have accepted responsibility for our actions.'

Under the deal, BP has also pleaded guilty
to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect and three misdemeanour 
counts - including one under the Clean Water Act and one for obstructing
Congress.

The record-breaking fine surpasses 
even the $1.3billion fine paid by drugs group 
Pfizer in 2009 for marketing fraud related to a pain medicine.

BP will pay $4billion dollars to the DoJ in installments over five years.

It will pay an additional $525million to the SEC over a period of three years.
BP will make the first payment of $175million this year to the SEC.

The group has already paid out more than $38billion relating to the oil spill.

BP is hoping to wrap up its financial liabilities from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but the overall impact on the Gulf Coast is still not known by researchers.

Oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well for 87 days before it was finally capped.

Some 68,000 square miles of the gulf were at one time covered in oil slick, about the area of Oklahoma.

More than 6,000 seabirds, 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill.

Many dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination and zooplankton have recently found to show traces of oil, as well.

The full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the government releases its Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which will collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf.

Mr Dudley said: 'All of us at BP 
deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon 
accident as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf coast region.'

He added: 'Since the spill, we have worked hard to rebuild confidence in the company.

'We take seriously not only our 
commitment to safety and operational excellence but also our 
communications with stakeholders, including the public, the government 
and our investors.'

Today's settlement removes some of 
the uncertainty hanging over the stock since the disaster, but it does 
not cover outstanding civil claims against the group.

BP said it will 'continue to vigorously defend itself' against civil claims and allegations of gross negligence.

'We are open to settlements, but only on reasonable terms,' said Mr Dudley.

The deal could resolve a significant share of the liability that BP faces after an explosion killed 11 workers and fouled the shorelines of four Gulf Coast states in the worst offshore spill in U.S. history.

BP still faces economic and environmental damage claims sought by U.S. Gulf Coast states and other private plaintiffs.

It is unclear what form of criminal misconduct BP will plead guilty to.

In an August filing, the Department of Justice said 'reckless management' of the Macondo well 'constituted gross negligence and willful misconduct,' which it intended to prove at a pending civil trial set to begin in New Orleans in February 2013.

The U.S. government has not yet filed any criminal charges in the case.

It is unclear whether the deal will resolve any civil charges brought by the Justice Department.

It is also unclear how large a financial penalty BP might pay to resolve the charges, or other punishments that BP might face.

Negligence is a central issue to BP's potential liability.

A gross negligence finding could nearly quadruple the civil damages owed by BP under the Clean Water Act to $21billion in a straight-line calculation.

According to the Justice Department, 
errors made by BP and Swiss-based Transocean Ltd, owner of the Deepwater
Horizon platform, in deciphering a key pressure test of the Macondo 
well are a clear indication of gross negligence.

'That such a simple, yet fundamental and safety-critical test could have been so stunningly, blindingly botched in so many ways, by so many people, demonstrates gross negligence,' the government said in its August filing.

The mile-deep Macondo well spewed 4.9million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of 87 days.

The torrent fouled shorelines from Texas to Florida and eclipsed Alaska's 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in severity.

BP has already announced an uncapped class-action settlement with private plaintiffs that the company estimates will cost $7.8billion to resolve litigation brought by over 100,000 individuals and businesses claiming economic and medical damages from the spill.
