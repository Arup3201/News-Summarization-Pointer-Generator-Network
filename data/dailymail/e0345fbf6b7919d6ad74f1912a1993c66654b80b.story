A Carnival cruise ship has failed a health inspection after dead flies, leaking brown water and a cockroach 'nymph' were found on board, according to a report published this week.

Inspectors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made a surprise visit to the boat on February 21 and found numerous failings from food galleys to service stations and at the swimming pools.

Fascination was scored 84 out of 100 - any grade of 85 or lower is considered a fail.

Among the many complaints from CDC inspectors was that there was not enough chlorine in swimming pools and there were no 'sneeze shields' in front of salad bars.

According to the report, an engineer on board Fascination did not follow protocol while he had acute gastroenteritis, going to the crew mess for breakfast, lunch and dinner on February 5.

A Carnival spokesman told MailOnline that the company was taking aggressive action over the failings and had requested a re-inspection as soon as possible. 

Fascination failed its inspection in the same month that another Carnival boat, the Triumph, became stranded in  the Gulf of Mexico for five days without working toilets, power or air conditioning.

During a recent U.S. Public Health inspection held in February, Carnival Fascination received a score of 84 out of 100 points, with 86 meeting U.S.P.H. standards. No violations were noted in the ship’s potable water systems, food handling, temperature, or production areas.

Following Carnival Cruise Lines’ established policies and procedures, corrective action was taken immediately, with several issues being resolved during the inspection and all issues resolved within 24 hours of the inspection.

A corrective-action report was provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which administers the Vessel Sanitation Program, and Carnival has requested re-inspection as soon as possible.

In the past five years, no Carnival ship has failed a U.S.P.H. inspection and the fleet’s average score during that time period is 97.  The average over 20 inspections already conducted in 2013 is 97.2. 

The health and well-being of our guests and crew is Carnival Cruise Lines’ highest priority, and on the extremely rare occasion when one of our ships has an unsatisfactory score, we initiate immediate and aggressive corrective action.

An engine fire crippled the sister ship Carnival Triumph leaving 4,200 passengers stranded at sea.

The boat finally limped to shore in Mobile, Alabama on February 14 where disembarking passengers described deplorable conditions where human waste sloshed down hallways, they slept in the open air to escape the heat and smell while food supplies ran low.

It is the latest in a litany of problems for the beleaguered cruise company Carnival.

Last month, passengers were flown back to the U.S. from a seven-day cruise to St Maarten after they were forced to disembark the ship following 'technical issues'.

A few days earlier, the company had announced that another ship, the Carnival Legend had 'a technical issue'
affecting the sailing speed, forcing the cancellation of a stop in 
Grand Cayman Islands.
