Jailed: Casey Bowen, nicknamed 'Pocket Money Boy' in the 1990s, was jailed for another three years today

A criminal nicknamed ‘Pocket Money Boy’ after social services gave him money to keep out of trouble nearly 20 years ago has been jailed for burgling a pensioner’s home and stealing her car.

Casey Bowen, 33, was just 14 when he earned his 'Pocket Money Boy' nickname in the mid 1990s.

Gloucester social services attempted to wean him off juvenile crime by paying him £60 a week - but today he was jailed for three years at Gloucester Crown Court for a crime he committed while on parole.

Bowen, from Churchdown, Gloucester, pleaded guilty to burglary, taking a car without the owner’s consent and going out equipped for burglary.

The cocaine-using father-of-two targeted a vulnerable 81-year-old woman in July this year who was living alone in Cheltenham, the court heard.

Bowen was still on licence from a five-and-a-half year sentence for armed robbery.

Prosecuting barrister David Maunder said: 'Mrs Susan Merrell, who is 81, was in the kitchen when she saw the defendant in her back garden.

'She asked him what he was doing and he said he could help her get rid of bags of rubbish and garden waste. She was thankful and said that it would be lovely.

'He followed her into the house, was polite and friendly and started to help her move items.

'He went into the living room where there was a sideboard and cabinet and told her not to follow him as he was behind the door.

'The defendant stacked the bags in the hallway along with a shopping trolley and he asked if he could borrow her car, a silver Rover 25. She agreed, gave him the keys and he loaded the bags into the vehicle.

'But when he left and she returned to the living room she found that two display cabinets had been emptied.

'Old and sentimental value items - bone china tea sets, plates and dishes, glassware and a Victorian clock - were gone.'

The court heard how a neighbour of the elderly woman saw Bowen reverse the Rover into his driveway before walking away the following day.

He took photographs of Bowen and called the police - who arrested him on July 20.

Defending solicitor Lloyd Jenkins said: 'Upon release from his current sentence my client has been co-operative, reliable and keen to prove that leopards can change their spots.

'All went well until he went back to Cheltenham, succumbed to temptation, started using cocaine again and mixing with the wrong sort of people.

'But when I spoke to him recently, for the first time ever he has demonstrated remorse and is ashamed of his behaviour.'

Jailing Bowen, Judge Hart said: 'You committed your first burglary at the age of 14 and since then a variety of non-custodial disposals have been tried.

'Your criminal record is littered with offending of a serious nature - violence, burglary and drugs supply - and you have served four jail sentences.

'Perhaps this is not a case of a leopard changing his spots but more of a leopard disguising his spots.

'You preyed on a vulnerable and elderly lady and stole items of sentimental value to her. You then took her car.

'Such offending has a damaging effect on the elderly whose feelings of vulnerability lead to helplessness.

'She put her faith in what she saw as your goodwill and you deliberately targeted her.'

Miss Merrell said after the hearing: 'The man just came up the garden path and said that he would take away my rubbish.

'I was very pleased and I went inside the house to get my purse to give him some money and he followed me in.

'I can’t remember what I was doing, but he stayed in the house and was helping himself to what he wanted.

'He took a lot of family heirlooms including a clock that my sister was very fond of. I was very cross about that. It made me fell very sick at that point.

'I didn’t realise what he had done. I only noticed that everything had gone the following morning.'

Bowen's criminal career dates back  two decades and in the 1990s Gloucestershire social services provoked national outrage when they started paying him £60 a week.

At the time, the authority thought the money would provide him with the means to legally purchase the items he regularly stole.

But the policy was condemned by politicians for paying what appeared to be a 'reward for crime.'
