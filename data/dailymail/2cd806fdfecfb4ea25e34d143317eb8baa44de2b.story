George W Bush has made no secret of his ambitions as a portrait artist - but his latest subject is one really close to his heart.

The former President has unveiled his newest oil painting, which shows him standing side by side with his father George H W Bush, who was President eight years before him.

The Presidential double-act is the latest in a slew of paintings by George W Bush. Other subjects have included Russian president Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Germany's Angela Merkel and the Dalai Lama.

Bush Jnr has also indulged in less serious subject, including the cat belonging to his mother, Barbara, and his own legs in the bathtub. 

He discussed his latest work on the Today Show this morning, where he said he tried to capture the 'gentle soul' of his father. He has previously painted his father individually.

Speaking about his artistic process, he said: 'I was very proud to be standing next to a man I admire greatly. First thing I wanted to make sure is I got the noses right. I've tried to paint a gentle soul, and I did it. As for me, I kind of bumbled through.'

It is part of a promotional drive for a new book by Bush Jnr about his father, who was in the White House from 1988 to 1992.

The book, named 41 because his father was the 41st president, sees the leader open up about his father, covering topics such as Bush family life, meetings with world leaders and the Watergate scandal.

Political influence: Bush has written how his father helped arrange a meeting with Vladimir Putin, also the star of one of the former President's portraits (left), in 2007

World leaders: Bush also painted Tony Blair, who was British Prime Minister for almost his entire time in the White House

Bathtime: Bush also took on less serious scenes, such as himself in the shower

A section dealing with Vladimir Putin shows that Bush Snr was continuing to play a part on the world stage well into his 80s.

Although the two almost talk politics, George W Bush would still use his father to help host world leaders - such as Putin in 2007, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report.

In an excerpt from the book, Bush told how he asked his father to invite Putin to the family compound at Walker's Point, Maine, so the two leaders could talk about missile defense programs.

In a surreal episode, Bush Snr, then 83, took Putin into the Atlantic on a speedboat. While the idea 'startled' the Russian leader at first, he 'loved' being driven at top-speed by the octogenarian politician when the time came.

They also went fishing, Bush wrote, though only Putin managed to catch anything. 

Elsewhere the book shows how a shocked Bush Snr told President Nixon to resign after learning he would lose an impeachment hearing over revelations he lied to the American people.

Bush Snr, then chairman of the Republican National Committee, sent a letter to Nixon urging him quit for his own good and that of the country, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report.

It said: 'I now firmly feel that resignation is best for this country, best for this President... If you do leave office, history will properly record your achievements with a lasting respect'.

The next day, he resigned.

41 is due to be released tomorrow.
