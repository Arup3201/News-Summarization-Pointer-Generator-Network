A 70-year-old U.S. Open tennis referee accused of smashing a coffee cup over her 80-year-old husband's head and stabbing him with one of the shattered pieces was apparently having an affair.

A search warrant affidavit has revealed police found numerous emails and notes between Lois Goodman and a man as they searched her Los Angeles home days after the death of her husband.

The revelation comes just two days after police swooped on Goodman in a New York City hotel as she prepared for the U.S. Open. She was taken away wearing her competition tracksuit.

The elderly mother of three has now be extradited back to Los Angeles, where she will face trial. As she quietly left a Manhattan court on Thursday, she was still wearing her referee uniform.

Motive? A search warrant affidavit has revealed Goodman was in contact with another man via email

After the death, she had originally claimed she had arrived home on April 17 to find her husband dead in their bed, and told police she believed he had suffered a heart attack and fallen down the stairs, before crawling back to bed where he died.

But Mrs Goodman 'was communicating with a male individual through the Internet', a search warrant affidavit, seen by the New York Daily News, has now revealed.

While they would not divulge the details of the notes, police added that they also found a handwritten letter to Goodman as part of the love triangle.

'The content of [an] email suggests that Lois was terminating a relationship and that alternate sleeping arrangements should be made in Los Angeles,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department wrote in the search warrant request on May 16.

section of Los Angeles, pictured, on April 17. It was only ruled a 
homicide this month but police had always believed it was suspicious

It is not clear whether this relationship was with her husband or with another man.

'Lois
minimised what she had seen,' Briscoe said of an interview four days 
after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to what she had seen and the 
loss of her husband was not typical of a grieving spouse.'

She had told detective she arrived 
home and found a trail of blood leading upstairs to a broken mug covered
in blood. She followed the blood to her bedroom, where she found her 
husband not breathing, according to the affidavit. She then called 911.

Before
he could be cremated, investigators intercepted the body and found 
multiple lacerations on the right side of his head, three cuts on his 
right ear and a blunt force trauma not consistent with a fall, the Daily
News reported.

Investigators
also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had 
suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said.

Blood
was also found on the kitchen floor, inside a linen closet and by a 
garage, and mug pieces were found in his scalp, sources told the Daily 
News.

When she was questioned for a second time, Goodman said the body looked as if it had been positioned by an intruder.

Despite these conflicting accounts 
and suggestions of an affair, Goodman has protested her innocence. She 
has returned to Los Angeles and is expected to be arraigned on Monday.

'I don’t know what happened,' Goodman told the New York Post from Rikers Island. 'It's a shock. This happened four months ago.'

'She's anxious to defend herself' in California, her New York lawyer, Guy Oksenhendler, said.

Neighbours have suggested the death came after weeks of arguing. Police had even 
visited the home a handful of times to see to disturbances, a groundskeeper, Alfonso 
Rosas, said.

Respected: Goodman has refereed matches with John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, among others

A
neighbour told the LA Daily News that she once saw Lois in her front 
yard and the woman said of her husband: 'He's driving me crazy.'

After her husband's death, she 
reportedly called a cleaner to deal with the blood-soaked carpets.

'She 
didn't seem at all upset,' neighbour Michael Rudchenko told the LA Daily News. 'When we heard he’d fallen down and passed away, I joked to my wife, "Somebody probably helped him die".'

After
a full homicide investigation on August 2, police ruled he had been attacked with a sharp object.

'It was a homicide. He had multiple sharp-force injuries,' Ed Winter, assistant chief of investigations for the coroner, said.

Goodman
became a prime suspect - but she was already on her way to New York for
the Open, which begins on Monday. She was arrested in her hotel at 8 
a.m. on Tuesday.

Locked up: She was held at Rikers Island before her extradition back to Los Angeles for a trial

Goodman is well known in tennis circles 
and was preparing to serve as a referee at the U.S. Open Tennis 
Championships tournament, a district attorney's office spokeswoman, Jane
Robison, said.

She has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Goodman
has umpired with some of the world's top tennis players since the 
1970s, including matches featuring Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and 
Martina Navratilova.

In a 1994 interview with
the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is my favorite sport and
I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best players. There's no real 
way to describe it.'
