A woman who disappeared in Idaho last week has been found 2,000 miles away disoriented in the small Mississippi town where her father was once a minister in the 1960s.

Cynthia Adams, 52, was reported missing by her husband on Tuesday when she didn't return from a doctor's appointment near her home in Boise. 

She told police in fits and starts she didn't know how she traveled the 2,160 miles to a home deep in the woods outside Clara, Mississippi.

Found: Cynthia Adams, 52, was found on Saturday in Clara, Mississippi, more than 2,000 miles from her home in Boise, Idaho, after she went missing on Tuesday. She doesn't remember how she got there

Adams, who has no history of memory problems,  could not remember her family in Idaho, police said.

Detectives discovered she made three cash withdrawals along the way, one in Idaho and two in Wyoming, according to Stan Niccolls of the Boise Police Department.

On Saturday, she appeared at the home of a woman she grew up with in Clara.

Wayne County, Mississippi, sheriff's deputy Michael Patton said Adams is lucky the same people lived at the house as in the 1960s.

Adams' husband told the Idaho Statesman newspaper he had no reason to believe Cynthia would simply disappear. 

The couple hadn't fought, and though she had health problems and a guide dog, she didn't have issues with her memory.

On Thursday, she was officially a missing person. 

On Friday, there was no update. 

But when Tina Brewer opened the Clara Grocery on Saturday morning, Adams was her first customer.

'She told us that she had got in at 1 o'clock in the morning and slept in her truck the night before,' Brewer said. 'She looked like somebody who'd been up all night. It was kinda strange.'

She started listing names, Brewer said, and though Brewer didn't know the people she was talking about, older men in the store did.

'She kinda knew everybody they knew, she'd say first names and they'd say last names,' Brewer said.

She asked for the McCarty girls. One man asked her, 'do you mean Bug?'

She did indeed mean Bug, the nickname of Elizabeth McCarty, who married and became Elizabeth Singleton.

Journey: Police said Adams made cash withdrawals in Idaho and Wyoming before appearing in Mississippi

Memory loss? Adams could not remember her husband in Idaho but knew people from her childhood

Adams then went straight to Singleton's home, deep in the woods outside of Clara, which is on the Pine Belt on the edge of the DeSoto National Forest, 20 miles west of the Alabama state line. 

Singleton said: 'She told me, these are the only clothes I've got. I said, well, honey, come on in.'

Adams  couldn't remember her family in Idaho, but she did remember the people she grew up with.

She said she had slept in the parking lot of her father's church on Friday night. The pastor's home used to be on the same property, along with a small religious school.

'She kept saying, "My home is gone and the school is burned,''' Singleton said. 'I didn't understand. I asked her, were you in a tornado?'

Then she went to Adams' Facebook page and saw the notices about her missing. She called police.

Wayne County Deputy Michael Patton pulled up to Singleton's house on Saturday afternoon.

'I didn't want to scare her,' Patton said. 'She appeared a little confused. She was dressed OK, normal. But I got her name, and then saw she was the lady that was missing from Idaho.'

Patton called an ambulance and watched them load her inside. Police reached her husband, who told the Idaho Statesman he planned to fly in as soon as he could. Staff at Wayne General Hospital in Waynesboro, Mississippi, declined to identify themselves or say whether Adams was a patient, citing federal privacy laws.

For the residents of Clara, word of the stranger in town was just beginning to get around after church on Sunday afternoon. Niccolls, of the Boise police, said that since Adams has been found safe, the investigation is over and no criminal charges are pending.

'Really,' Niccolls said, 'it's up to her now what she does.'

Singleton is still reeling from Adams' surprise visit.

'It was really crazy,' Singleton said. 'I'm hoping she'll get help. She's welcome to drop back by.'
