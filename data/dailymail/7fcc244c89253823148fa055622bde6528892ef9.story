Swimwear model Jessica Hart has accused nightclub owner Adam Hock of starting a fight with her boyfriend and Prince Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco

Swimwear model Jessica Hart has accused nightclub owner Adam Hock of starting a fight with her boyfriend and Prince Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco.

Adam Hock, has been accused of leaving the 24-year-old prince with a broken jaw and needing hospital treatment after he punched him at Double Seven, a Meatpacking District bar.

But he has since insisted the prince and his friends, including Hart's boyfriend Stavros Niarchos began the brawl and that he 'acted 100% in self-defence.'

But Sports Illustrated model, Hart, 25,whose boyfriend is heir to a Greek shipping fortune took to her Twitter page to rubbish his claims.

'Ha!' Hart tweeted. 'It’s going to be so pleasurable when the truth does come out and he’s exposed as the freaky liar he is.'

Hart made clear she thought his accusations of being an innocent party were rubbish

'Although,
I have to say, I am getting a little pleasure watching him run to the 
press, squirming and lying in desperation,' Hart tweeted.

Mr Hock’s lawyer Sal Strazzullo was not amused and told New York Daily News he may take the Australian model to court:

'I
expect her to come in and tell the truth and then, if she’s going to 
resort to name calling like calling my client a liar, she will open 
herself up to defamation and libel.'

Witness: Hart, was in the nightclub with her boyfriend Stavros Niarchos, right, heir to a Greek shipping fortune who was said to have tried to help the prince during the scuffle 

A witness told the New York Post that Ms Hart screamed at Natasha Poly, the wife wealthy Dutch businessman Peter Bakker who was seated at Mr Hock's table. 

They said that Ms Hart shouted at her: 'Your husband’s a loser! F*** you!' on the street outside the nightclub after the incident.

Mr Hock has been vocal in putting his side of the story across to the media.

'I acted 100% in self-defence. I felt I 
had to defend the honor of the women I was with,' said Hock, 47 who was 
pictured leaving a clinic wearing a sling on his left arm, he told the New 
York Daily News.

'They expected to be treated like the royalty they are. They didn’t get what they wanted, and it pissed them off,' he added.

But the prince's camp insists the one-time 
football jock went berserk, swinging round-house punches at anyone in 
sight in the early Saturday brawl.

'The facts are very clear,' said Nadine Johnson, a spokeswoman for Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, reported New York Daily News.

'There was only one person arrested, Mr. Hock, who spent two days in jail as a result of his actions.

Mr Hock said he is deciding whether he will press charges against the four.

Mr Hock was 
sitting with two friends and three catwalk models when the prince, the third
in line to Monaco’s throne, allegedly approached him and started a 
confrontation after trying to drink a $500 bottle of vodka from their table.

'I thought they were being childish, 
because they then sent over another bottle of vodka, saying, "If you 
don’t want us to drink your vodka, here’s another bottle," ' Hock said 
to the New York Post.

After a confrontation Hock is said to have punched the prince 
and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he
landed with blood pouring from his face.

One of the prince's friend allegedly grabbed a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and tried to hit Hock 
with it.

Among those with the prince was 
Jessica Hart, a supermodel, Stavros Niarchos III, a shipping heir and 
ex-boyfriend of Paris Hilton, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, a New York art 
dealer and godson to photographer Mario Testino, and Diego Marroquin, a 
Manhattan socialite

The prince was taken to hospital for treatment and released a short time later.

‘Pierre’s face looked broken, 
with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like 
he needed plastic surgery.’

But Hock‘s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, insisted that Casiraghi started the fight and threw the first punch.

He accused the prince and his friends of being 'wealthy barons from Europe' with an inflated sense of ownership.

'They
think New York is their honeycomb. They think they can come here and do
whatever they want,' Strazzullo said to the New York Daily News. 

The 47-year-old was arrested and 
later appeared in court, charged with four counts of assault against 
Prince Pierre and three of his friends.

Hock’s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said: 
‘My client was with some very very nice women and Mr Casiraghi became 
jealous of who he was with.

They wanted some recognition [from the 
women] and it happened because of that. My client acted in self- 
defence, it was an unprovoked attack.

‘I don’t know why Mr Casiraghi got  
jealous about my client – he is from a humble background.’

He added: ‘My
client is not Bruce Lee… These four guys are trust-fund babies who 
think the world is owed to them. They are like spoiled brats.’

But one of the prince’s friends said he was ‘slammed for no reason’, and that another was punched when he tried to intervene.

Richard Golub, who is representing the prince and his friends, said the incident was ‘entirely unprovoked’.

Pierre’s family have a long history 
of  scandal and intrigue, and the latest episode seems to suggest he is 
following in their footsteps.

Known as the ‘party prince’, Pierre 
is believed to have dropped out of university and has been seen at 
nightclubs everywhere from Miami to Milan.
