Collector Phil Green suspected there was something extraordinary about a green rock he found in his backyard six years ago - but he had no idea it was out of this world.

The Massachusetts man recently received confirmation from NASA that the mud-covered rock he pulled out of the Merrimack River, which runs behind his Amesbury home, was a segment of the Mir Space Station.

Out of this world: Amesbury resident Phil Green found this mud-covered rock in a river behind his house, and recently discovered it was a piece of a Russian space station

After a year-long analysis, the space agency sent him a letter saying they were 87 per cent sure his rock was a remnant of the Soviet spacecraft according to WHDH.com.

Green, a custodian at Amesbury Elementary School, told the Eagle Tribune he found the rock while searching for arrowheads near the river, and it stood out to him.

'The river gets scoured really well by the ice in the wintertime, so you wouldn’t expect to find a small rock sitting on top of what’s almost like pavement and granite,' Green said.

'So I went over and picked it up.'

He said the rock was a burnt shade of green with a distinctive glassy structure after he washed away the mud.

One side had 'about a hundred tiny pores', most commonly seen in volcanic rock.

Using a metal detector, the unique item collector found that it had no traces of metal in it.

Not sure what to do with it, he left the rock outside for about five years until a friend came over and suggested it could be a meteor.  

Not long later, his sister-in-law, a Newburyport teacher, saw the rock and sent it to NASA to be analyzed, according to the Eagle Tribune.

After waiting about a year, Green had given up hope of ever hearing anything about the mysterious rock.

Then a couple of weeks ago, he received a package in the mail from NASA containing his rock, a plaque and a letter from NASA Analysis Engineer George Leussis confirming that the rock had indeed fallen from space.

The letter confirmed that while the rock originated on Earth, it had definitely been subjected to a fall from low Earth orbit, which was the reason for the rock’s green color and strange properties, according to the Eagle Tribune.

'The material shows a composition similar to that used as ballast by the soviet space program starting in the mid 1980s,' Leussis wrote.

'This places its most likely origin as Mir, or one of the Progress-M class Russian resupply vehicles, that had undergone a TPS failure.'

Mir was a Russian space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001. When it fell to earth in March 2001, most of it landed in the South Pacific ocean.
