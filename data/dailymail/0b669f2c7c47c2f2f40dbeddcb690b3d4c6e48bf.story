A model village in a widow's garden that fell into disrepair after the death of her husband has been restored to its former glory by  volunteers.

Great-grandmother Pat Bullman and her husband Oliver, both 80, spent over 50 years creating the miniature attraction at their home in Wicken, Cambridgeshire.

They started with a windmill for their daughter and gradually added other buildings, including a fire station, railway station, hotel, fish and chip shop and church.

Pat Bullman's model village built in her garden in Wicken, Cambridgeshire, has been restored by volunteers

Great-grandmother Mrs Bullman and her husband Oliver spent over 50 years creating the miniature attraction

But after it fell into disrepair, Mrs Bullman asked volunteers to help bring it back to its former glory 

Two volunteers have now helped to recreate the village and bring it back to life with new characters and buildings

There are also new picnic benches (pictured) on which new characters in the village can sit  

Beverley Lorking, 73, from Ely and Tony Middleton, who is in his 60s, from Cambridge helped with the project

But, after Mr Bullman died in 2012, the wooden models began rotting away.

With Mrs Bullman was too frail to keep it up, she issued an appeal for people to help her save the village.

Beverley Lorking, 73, from Ely  and Tony Middleton, who is in his 60s, from Cambridge came forward to help and used their skills as former toolmakers to bring the model village back to life.

It is now scattered with bright pink and white cottages, Tudor houses, a fire station, shops, diggers - and even has a new pub called 'The Bull' with picnic benches.

The new buildings include a farmshop (pictured) which has been put together by the former toolmakers

There is a new river, paddocks of animals and dozens of different farm buildings (pictured)

Those passing could donate to the cause (left), which has led to the arrival of a new pub on site (right)

There is now a blue and white flower shop on site, complete with terracotta pots and bunches of flowers

The village church has a stain-glassed window (left) while the pavements and footpaths have also been relaid (right) 

There are dozens of new vehicles on the site, including this bright red miniature OXO van 

The newly-renovated windmill stands over tiny pens full of farm animals and a painted winding river.

Mr Lorking helped renovate the old buildings with a fresh lick of paint while Tony created brand new ones.

One person offered wood for free and a nearby shop donated tins of unopened paint.

Mrs Bullman said: 'We've finally done all the finishing touches and it just looks amazing. It's so bright and cheerful and I can't thank Beverley and Tony enough for helping me.

Mrs Bullman and her husband Oliver spent more than 50 years creating the miniature attraction at their home

It gradually developed every year and visitors would come by the house to see the latest addition 

But, after Mr Bullman died in 2012, aged 80, the wooden models began rotting away

The benches started to rot while the characters started to lose their polished-looking finish

One person offered wood for free and a nearby shop donated tins of unopened paint so these items could be given a fresh look

Mrs Bullman was upset when the village started to fade because she wanted it to be a memorial to her husband

'I know Oliver would have been so pleased to see it all put together again, he'd have been really proud.

'There's so much going on now, some things couldn't be saved but we've now got new items such as a new signal box with railings.'

Mrs Bullman said she wanted the new village to be a memorial to her husband and added: 'I just couldn't believe it could turn out like this. I really hope I can attract the children and families again.'

Mr. Bullman, who worked as a digger driver, was still making new pieces for the village when he died from  cancer at the age of 80.

He and his wife had one daughter, two grandmothers and seven great-grandchildren.
