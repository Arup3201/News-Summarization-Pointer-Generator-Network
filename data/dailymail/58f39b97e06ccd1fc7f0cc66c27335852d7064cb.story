After Queensland mother-of-three and certified lactation consultant  Meg Nagle posted photos of herself breastfeeding on Facebook, she was outraged when the page she used to support other mothers was suspended.

The Milk Meg Facebook page was closed for at least 24 hours last year prompting Ms Nagle, of the Sunshine Coast, to coin the term lactaboobiephobia; a fear of women breastfeeding.

'One photo was reported and just the photo was taken down. When a second photo was reported the page was temporarily suspended,' the American-born 32-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.

Informed the photos violated Facebook's photo policy, they were permanently removed from the page by Facebook when it was reactivated.

While Mrs Nagel said she believes Facebook's polices have since changed to allow images of breastfeeding, she was outraged at that time.

'When that happened I was so frustrated by that. I was just thinking about this whole thing and how people have an issue with it, this fear of breastfeeding.

'The term just popped into my head, because of my psychology background, and I took a liking to it.'

Using her professional blog about breastfeeding, Mrs Nagle wrote a post about the experience in March last year and believes she was the first person in the world to coin the term after a Google search at the time found nothing.

After posting images of herself breastfeeding on Facebook more than a year ago, the page was suspended for about 24 hours

'I purposely searched online to make sure it wasn't anywhere and at the time it wasn't out there at all.'

Since then a documentary filmmaker has approached her to work on a 10-minute piece about the incident and her blog response.

Filmed earlier this year, the documentary will be released online later this year.

In the past Mrs Nagle said she has experienced lactaboobiephobia, including when a man asked her to breastfeed in a toilet.

The incident happened a few years ago while she was breastfeeding her second son in the U.S.

'I was sitting in a cafe in America, but it happens in Australia too,' she said. 'A man said: "You know there's a toilet down the hall", and then he said it again.

The 32-year-old coined the term lactaboobiephobia around a fear of women breastfeeding, following the Facebook incident

'I asked: "If I was feeding my baby with a bottle that would be OK?" and he said: "Yes that would be fine". It was a horrible experience but you get that in life.'

With nothing more to say, Mrs Nagle left the cafe. 'You hear about it in the media all the time. Most people don't even think twice when they see a woman breastfeeding, but on the odd occasion it does happen.

Mrs Nagle said after the birth of her first son, who is now 11, she had a lot of support with breastfeeding.

But it was not until the birth of her third son two years ago that she decided to make a career out of support other women with breastfeeding.

Studying nursing at the time and having already been a volunteer breastfeeding councillor for seven years, the move was a natural fit and also allowed her to draw on her previous psychology studies.

Mrs Nagle said the demand for lactation consultants was growing and that Australia and the U.S. have the largest numbers of consultants.

'I think it's really difficult with breastfeeding because there is so much information out there,' she said.

'Sometimes women don't get support in hospital or if they do, they don't get the support when they get home.

'I come from the philosophy of testing you own instincts as a mother and following the lead of the baby... I give women as many different suggestions as I can.'

She said there was no black and white approach to breastfeeding.

'Women will find some things work better than others. Different women will experience different things - its about listening to instincts.

'Finding that support that really is in line with their own parent philosophy is important.

Following the lead of the baby without strict schedules and encouraging women to choose what feels right for them from a range of options are the basis of Mrs Nagle's approach to breastfeeding.

She added that in western cultures, there was often a lack of support around breastfeeding as part of the shift away from community living.Â 

She has used social media and her blog to build a community of mothers, with nearly 15,000 likes on her Facebook.

'I've built a big community of mums who feel like my philosophies are something they relate to,' she said.

As part of her work as a lactation consultant, Mrs Nagle has used social media and a blog to connect with breastfeeding mothers

'Facebook is amazing for mums to share information and get support - it's about mums helping each other.

Still breastfeeding her youngest son, two, Mrs Nagle said it made it even easier for other breastfeeding mothers to relate to her.

'I think it's really important for me as a mum to be sharing my own experiences,' she said. 'It's really helpful to share stories and my own breastfeeding experiences.'

Thanks to her work with breastfeeding mothers, Mrs Nagle has been nominated for the 2014 National AusMumpreneur Awards in the blog and emerging AusMumpreneur categories.

'It's great I get really supportive feedback from mums,' she said. 'I get lots of good feedback on Facebook.'
