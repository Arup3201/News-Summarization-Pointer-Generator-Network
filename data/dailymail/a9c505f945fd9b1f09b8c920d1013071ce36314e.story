If scantily clad models dancing provocatively to drums in the desert doesn't spell steamy, add in a hunky male model licking dripping water off them.

The third collaboration between Agent Provocateur and Penelope and Monica Cruz sees the actress back in the director’s chair as well on the screen for the L'Agent AW14  collection advert.

Encapsulating the overt sex appeal that the Agent Provocateur brand has become known for, the fantasy begins in a barren desert, where a young man crawls along, desperate for water.

The fantasy begins in a barren desert, where a young man crawls along, desperate for water, but ends up seeing a very different mirage to normal

But rather than seeing the traditional mirage of an oasis of water, the traveller sees a troupe of scantily-clad women dancing on the sand.

Arriving in a red Cadillac with Penelope Cruz at the wheel, the women pile out before sensuously stripping off to reveal their bright – and minimal - L’Agent by Agent Provocateur lingerie.

Featuring bold prints and a rainbow of colours from peacock green, neon orange to indigo, the underwear is certainly hard to miss as the women perform an aerobics-inspired dance, choreographed by celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson.

The advert shows the women teasing and taunting the thirsty traveller

As the man, played by top male model Jon K, desperately crawls closer and closer to the girls, they begin to pour water over themselves.

In one of the most steamy moments of the film - indeed, of any Agent Provocateur campaign to date - the man, having reached the bevy of beauties begins to lick the water off their bare legs. 

As the women continue to writhe around the poor parched traveller, almost smothering him with their near naked bodies, while Penelope looks on from the car.

Speaking about the campaign, the 40-year-old actress said: ‘I loved having the opportunity to direct my second L ’Agent by Agent Provocateur film, I’m really proud of the brand and loved directing both campaigns.

Penelope says of the film: 'I felt it was  really important to create a very sensual film that could also tell a little story'

‘Monica and I are really happy with our Autumn Winter 2014 collection, it’s really vibrant.

'So I felt it was  really important to create a very sensual film that  could also tell a little story, like the first one I did.

‘I got the idea f or the film while I was listening to the track from Optimist, "Single Dutch", by Eduardo Cruz. His music always inspires me so much.

Collaborating with Tracy on the choreography was the perfect fit and brought a great dynamic to the set.’
