Kris lived through a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic dad and absent mum 

A woman who nearly died of anorexia and survived a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic father and absent mother has spoken out about her childhood to try and help other children.

Kris Teece, 38, says she never really had a stable home until she moved to country town Armidale in regional NSW when she was four. 

''Growing up in my household was fractious. My dear father was a chronic alcoholic who had severe seizures if he didn't drink,' she said. 

'It was not your average nuclear family, the house had an atmosphere filled with lots of arguing and fighting and you never really knew what to expect. 

'My mother was emotionally unavailable to me and often lived away from me after the age of 10. 

'She moved away from us to go to work to try and support us. 

'Mum was not coping with what was happening. 

'My parents would fight and I obviously didn't want to see that or be around it. 

'My situation was not unique, it's a lot more common than people realise.

'Unfortunately It's a reality that a lot of children and young people have to deal with and they have to create another family around them. 

'I was always over at neighbour's homes and that was the good thing about living in a country town. 

'And that is exactly what I had to do, I moved in with my grandparents pretty much full time from the age of 10 an

'Even though I was away from my immediate family a lot I have always had people around me, I had a strong community, not everyone has that which is really sad.'

Kris was diagnosed with 'severe' anorexia when she was 15, she was hospitalised for three months

Kris says much of her teenage years are a 'blur' after using alcohol and drugs to get away from reality 

When Kris was 14 she developed anorexia and she says 'if I hadn't have gone into the hospital when I did I could have died from it'.  

She said: 'The anorexia started  when I really wanted to be good at ballet and and I didn't have any self confidence. It became my way of trying to control the world around me.'

Kris was an ballerina when she became anorexic 

'When I was 15 I was seen by a doctor who saw that I was very ill and I was sent away to recover at Westmead Hospital for three months to be treated for 'severe' anorexia. 

'I didn't know why I wanted to starve myself but away from family and my life, I learnt that there were some things very wrong with my family. 

'When I was at the hospital I began to talk. I was amazed how many people listened and cared.'

Soon after leaving the hospital Kris turned to drink and drugs to try and escape from reality. 

At 16 she went into Armidale refuge and that was where she met youth worker Leesa Waters who was one of the people who 'absolutely transformed' her life. 

'It was scary to have people care but I also knew I needed that so much.' 

'I connected with three of the youth workers over the time I was there and the president of that refuge was a foster carer. 

'The president  even took me in when I was kicked out. 

'Leesa was one of many people that I met and I was really lucky that a number of people went above and beyond to help me.

'She did more than what was expected, those years are a bit hazy because I was using drug and alcohol to medicate what I couldn't deal. 

'That started soon after I got out of hospital and lost one addiction and I found another one.  

'I really felt that Leesa had respect for me and I could not work out why, she was very encouraging about me achieving life goals and finding a path through the chaos at that point. 

'I was really disengaged from most things in society, when someone like that comes along it has a really positive impact.'  

After losing contact when they left the refuge Leesa and Kris bumped into each other crossing a road in Parramata four years ago.

They both worked in child protection and decided to keep in contact and they have been working together on the NAPCAN project for National Child Protection Week.

Kris, now a mother of four and lives in Castle Hill, Sydney, decided to speak in depth about her childhood to try and help save other who are in the same situations.

She wants to encourage kids to speak up about their problems as part of the 'Play Your Part' campaign being run by NAPCAN.  

Kris says the help she got from adults and the community throughout her life helped to make her a successful adult.

'Kids needs day to day interactions with adults. If it wasn't for the adults I had in her life things might have turned out very different.

'I came into contact with a lot of other rough people who were really struggling who didn't have the networks that i did and the outcomes have been really different,' she explained. 

Leesa Waters, deputy CEO of NAPCAN, hopes by Kris sharing her story she can help other children

'The focus of the campaign is to get across that everyone has a part to play. 

'It takes a village to raise a child and sometimes parents can't give the child all the help they need. 

'I believe children and young people need the help of more than just their parents, they need the community to show they are worthwhile. 

'I have made sure that I am deeply involved in the lives of all my children. 

'My son started playing rugby union and I had no idea about it until I started going to games and I ended up managing his team. 

'My daughter does ballet and I got really involved in what she was doing so I am part of her life.'

Leesa, Deputy CEO for NAPCAN added: 'This is a story demonstrating positive outcomes when people play their part to support children, especially children facing great challenges. 

'Kris is such an inspiring person to so many; she is a mum, she has completed a degree in music and education from Sydney conservatorium where she became a member of the Golden Key Society for high academic achievement, she has a masters in criminology, she has been a foster carer, a kinship carer, a private ballet and singing instructor and a qualified fitness instructor.   

'The Play Your Part initiative by NAPCAN has been designed to try and shift social norms and make the provision of a safe community for children and young people a concern shared by all Australians.

'We did a survey in 2009 and it came back that 92 per cent believed that child abuse and neglect was a really serious issue, and my view around that is that people don't know what to do or how to help and it is always a lot easier if you can give people a story that moves them.'
