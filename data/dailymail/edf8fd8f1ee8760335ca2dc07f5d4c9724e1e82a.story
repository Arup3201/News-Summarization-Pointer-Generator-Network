Wayne Rooney has claimed that Manchester United are 'heading in the right direction' despite Sunday's derby defeat ensuring Louis van Gaal has presided over the club's worst start to a season since 1986.

United have just 13 points after 10 Barclays Premier League games under the Dutchman, despite spending more than £150million on stars including Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo, who all played in the 1-0 derby defeat against Manchester City on Sunday.

But captain Rooney remains positive about his side's progress under their new boss and insisted the poor form is a result of adjusting to the Dutchman’s managerial methods. England's skipper also said it is only a matter of time before the new-look United shifts into top gear.

‘We're working on different things, which a lot of us haven't been used to,’ Rooney told MUTV. ‘We're certainly heading in the right direction.

‘We're progressing each week and playing some nice football. We need to turn that into results and I'm sure we can do that if we keep working, keep learning and keep doing what the manager wants from us.’

Rooney also joined Van Gaal in criticising Chris Smalling for his red card in the derby, admitting the defender’s sending-off cost his side the game.

Rooney called for Smalling to ‘learn’ from the experience after his reckless defending left United in the near-hopeless position of playing 51 minutes with 10 men against the Premier League champions.

Van Gaal had branded Smalling ‘stupid’ for his two yellow cards, the first coming when he needlessly tried to block a kick from hand by Joe Hart and the second a result of a wild lunge on James Milner just minutes later.

‘Chris is disappointed,’ Rooney said. ‘It's tough when you get sent off, especially in a derby and with such a long time to go in the game it made it difficult for the rest of us to hold on. I'm sure Chris will learn from that.’

Rooney, who played well in a deeper midfield role despite being outnumbered by City, also claimed United were better than their hosts for much of the game, despite going down to a 1-0 defeat sealed by Sergio Aguero’s second-half strike.

‘We responded well and defended well [after falling behind],’ Rooney said. ‘I felt for long periods of the game we were the better team. We took control of the game with 10 men and created the better chances.

‘We were unfortunate not to get anything out of the match and we're disappointed to leave with no points after a great effort.’
