Charged: Oklahoma English teacher Jennifer Sexton is charged with following her 15-year-old English student 650 miles to Mississippi, where she allegedly had sex with him in a hotel room

An Oklahoma middle school English teacher allegedly followed a 15-year-old student on his summer vacation 650 miles away to a Mississippi hotel room, where police say she had sex the the boy in June.

Jennifer Sexton had quit her job at Hollis Middle School just two months before amid suspicions in the community that something inappropriate was going on between her and the student.

'People seeing a teacher alone with a child may or may not be anything. It could just be innocent contact,' Harmon County Assistant District Attorney Eric Yarborough told the Oklahoman.

Until the June arrest, those hunches were all authorities had to go on and the boy was uncooperative.

'The child said nothing’s going on, she’s just a nice teacher,' said Yarborough. 

Now the unnamed victim has revealed several sexual encounters with Sexton.

In fact, in Oklahoma in the months before they were caught together in a Best Western, he said they had sex several times.

He told police they had sex in Sexton's classroom for the first time just days before she resigned.

They also allegedly had sex in her SUV and in her home.

The boy even said they had sex in the home of Sexton's pastor father.

Scene of the crime? Sexton and her middle school student were allegedly caught together in this Mississippi Best Western, where police say the 28-year-old had sex with the boy in June

A month before Sexton drove her SUV to Olive Branch, Mississippi and allegedly picked up the victim from a church, she won a divorce from her husband and took back her maiden name, Caswell. 

Whether she's going by Sexton or Caswell, she's now an accused sex offender.

She turned herself in this past Friday and faces three counts of second-degree rape, two counts of enticing a child, a one forcible sodomy count.
