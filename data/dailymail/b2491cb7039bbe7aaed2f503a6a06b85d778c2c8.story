However in June, the following month, Biden tested positive for cocaine during a urinalysis, according to The Journal.

No comment: Vice President Joe Biden - seen here with son Hunter Biden at the Duke Georgetown NCAA college basketball game in Washington in 2010 -is yet to comment on reports his son was booted from the Navy Reserves

He was officially discharged in February this year.

In a statement released to The Wall Street Journal, Biden apologized for his actions, but did not address the reason for his discharge. 

'(It was) the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge,' the statement to the newspaper said.

'I respect the Navy’s decision.

'With the love and support of my family, I’m moving forward.'

The vice president's office have not commented on the reports.

The Navy would not comment on the reasons behind Biden's discharge as per restrictions of the Privacy Act.

Navy personnel who are discharged from the military because of a failed drug test don’t receive honorable discharges.

While Biden did not address why he was discharged in his statement, he mentioned it was an 'administrative discharge'. 

Adding to the revelations, The Journal also reported that Biden needed two waivers in order to be accepted into the Reserves - one on account of his age, and a second 'because of a drug-related incident when he was a young man'.

The newspaper cited sources close to the matter. 

The Vice President Biden joked that his son’s decision to join the Navy late in life was one of poor judgement while speaking at the American Legion’s Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball in 2013.

'We have a lot of bad judgment in my family,' Biden said. 

'My son over 40 just joined the Navy to be sworn in.'

Hunter Biden is the youngest son of Joe Biden and wife Jill Biden, who is Hunter's stepmother.

A self-proclaimed 'military family', his brother, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, served in the state’s National Guard.

Beau Biden was also deployed to Iraq for one year while in the guard and has recently spoken of plans to run for governor in 2016.

According to The Washington Post, Hunter Biden accepted a position on the board of Burisma Holdings, the Ukraine's largest private gas firm, in May this year - three months after his reported discharge.

The appointment attracted controversy, as Vice President Biden has moved to influence energy policies and other issues of the Ukrainian government as it battles Russia and pro-Russian separatists to control the county, Fox News reported.

Hunter Biden also serves as managing partner at Rosemont Seneca Partners, a Washington DC-based investment firm, and is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University.

His biological mother, Joe Biden's first wife, Neilia Hunter, and his younger sister, Naomi, were killed in an automobile accident in 1972.

Hunter and Beau Biden were seriously injured.

Joe Biden went on to marry second wife, Jill, with whom he had a daughter, Ashley. 

Hunter Biden and his wife Kathleen have three daughters - Naomi, Finnegan, and Maisy.

The revelation of Hunter Biden's administrative discharge for drugs is not the first time the family of the Vice President has been rocked by scandal.

In 2009, The New York Post ran a series of stories about the youngest of the clan, Ashley Biden, now 33.

The newspaper claimed a person claiming to be a friend was shopping around a video, purportedly of the social worker snorting lines of white powder at a party.

'On a 90-second clip from the video that The Post viewed, a young woman strongly resembling Ashley is seen taking a red straw from her mouth, bending over a desk, inserting the straw into her nostril and snorting lines of white powder,' the newspaper reported.

However the video was never purchased and subsequently not released publicly.

At the same time The Post reported of Biden's reptuation as a wild party girl in college.

One Tulane University classmate, Nat Berman, told the paper he had to bail Biden out of jail after she was arrested for marijuana possesion as a freshmen.

The incident occurred in New Orleans in September 1999 but does not appear on Biden's record.

In 2012, Ashley Biden and her husband, Dr. Howard Krein, were married.
