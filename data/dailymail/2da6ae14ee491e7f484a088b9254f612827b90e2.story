Businesses will today be promised a £10 billion boost in the Conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit Labour's damaging row with captains of industry.

Business minister Matthew Hancock said he is 'shocked and dismayed' to be having to argue that 'business is a force for good', a question he said he thought had been 'settled in the last century'.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, the Cabinet minister set out plans to cut regulation and red tape, saving firms an average of £2,000 a year.

Mr Hancock also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start-up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious industrial tribunal claims.

'Business is a force for good in our society,' he said. 'It's the first time in my adult life that a major political party thinks that being against business is good for Britain.

'We have to support and build our nation's employers. This is where jobs and prosperity come from. Coming from a small business background, it's why I came into politics in the first place, and we've spent five years working hard to make Britain a beacon for enterprise.

'We are increasingly regarded as a good place to start and grow a business and we want to be the best in the world. Labour's idea that you can attack business and businesspeople without damaging people's standard of living and jobs in Britain should have been consigned to the history books in the last century.'

Labour has been embroiled in a damaging row with business leaders since turning on the boss of Boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power. Ed Miliband has launched a series of policies supposed to target what he calls 'predator' capitalists.

The party has suggested it will not go ahead with a planned cut in corporation tax for large firms to 21 per cent.

Over the last week, more business leaders, including several who previously supported Labour, have come out to raise concern about the party's anti-business rhetoric.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, meanwhile, faced embarrassment when he could only name someone called 'Bill' when asked to cite Labour's business backers. The row has left Mr Balls facing a tricky appearance next week at the British Chambers of Commerce, which he is due to address.

Mr Hancock said the Conservatives would go into the election as 'unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise'.

He said the coalition had gradually cut regulation -- consignined 110,000 pages to the dustbin, saving business £2.2 billion this year.

But a Conservative-only government would go further, committing to more deregulation -- with the initial focus on agriculture, railways, energy, construction, retail, travel operators and the chemical industry.

A review of each sector will take place this year if the Tories remain in power, and Government departments made to implement a 'one in, two out' rule whenever they introduce any new regulation.

Mr Hancock said he accepted there was scepticism about red tape 'bonfires', but the coalition had made 'solid' progress.

Most striking was a 75 per cent fall in the number of tribunal claims against firms following reforms introduced by the Government to weed out vexatious claims. Employees now have to have been working for their employer for two years before they can take them to a tribunal alleging unfair dismissal, and go through a conciliation process before lodging a claim.

Boots, which has 70,000 UK workers, came under fire from senior Labour figures after the attack on its business policies

But the minister said: 'There are areas where we haven't been able to go, because of the Liberal Democrats -- particularly in terms of making it easier to employ people.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable has accused the Tories of wanting to make it possible for firms to 'fire at will'.

Mr Hancock said: 'It's about making it easier to take on your first employees. We need greater clarity that you can take somebody on and if it goes wrong you won't pay an unduly heavy price.

'There is a lot of bureaucracy around taking people on and we want to make it easier.'

Baroness Brady, the Apprentice star who now a Conservative peer and an adviser on small business to the Government, said: 'Red tape hits small businesses harder than anything else. For an entrepreneur working all hours to build their business and provide for themselves and their family it really can mean the difference between success and failure.

Former Apprentice star Karen Brady said government rep tape hits small businesses 'harder than anything else'

'Government should do everything it can to celebrate enterprise and back risk takers, but sometimes that means getting out of the way of their success.

'Cutting red tape has been a key part of this Government’s economic plan and has already saved businesses £10 billion, but there’s still much more we can do. Every penny we can save small businesses by scrapping unnecessary regulations means more jobs, more growth and more hardworking people able to make a success of their business.'

John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'Government regulation all too often places excessive financial and administrative burdens on British businesses. After years of campaigning to cut red tape, it is welcome to see proposals for stretching deregulation targets for the next Parliament — which would help companies concentrate on jobs and exports, rather than on endless compliance measures.

'A stretch target for deregulation would also send a clear message to Whitehall that new rules must be a last resort, rather than a first reflex for mandarins and ministers alike.'

Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said: 'The coalition Government has made encouraging progress in reducing the burden of regulation on business, and in particular on small and medium sized businesses. We welcome the ambition shown in the commitment to finding a further £10billion worth of regulatory savings, and urge all political parties to consider how they can make it easier, smoother and more efficient to do business in the UK. The target announced by the Conservatives is admirable, and we’ll work with all parties to make sure deregulation stays at the top of political agenda.

'The next parliament will see continuing pressure of the public finances whoever wins, so we need to unleash business to drive economic growth and generate tax revenues.'

Toby Perkins, Labour’s shadow small business minister, said: 'The truth is that ministers have blocked Labour’s plans to back small business by tackling late payment and to deal with unfair and uncompetitive treatment of suppliers. They’ve opposed our plans to cut – then freeze – business rates, and at a time when net lending to small and medium sized businesses has fallen by £1 billion in the last quarter, they’ve opposed our plans for a proper British Investment Bank supported by a regional network.

'Where the Tory-led government has failed to act to support small firms, the next Labour government will.'

It is now mandatory for a claimant to contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) before they can lodge a claim with an employment tribunal. So far Acas has conciliated in over 37,000 cases, and only 24 per cent progressed to a Tribunal Claim.

Increased flexiblity on firms' audit requirements has saved £300 million a year.

Plays, live music acts and indoor sports displays no longer need to obtain a licence to perform in schools, nurseries, hospitals, circuses and arts centres, which has saved businesses £1.4 million each year

Paper tax discs have been scrapped, saving firms with company vehicles time and money.

A requirement for retailers to notify TV Licensing of the name and address of TV purchasers has been axed, saving them £2.5 million per year.

EU rules defining jam as being 'two-thirds sugar' have been ditched, stopping firms such as Clippy's, which have a lower sugar content, having to relabel their products 'fruit spread'.
