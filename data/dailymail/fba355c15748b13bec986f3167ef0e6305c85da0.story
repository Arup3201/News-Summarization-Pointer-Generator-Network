Woolwich suspect Michael Adebowale became radicalised after trying to escape gangland ‘trouble’, it was claimed yesterday.

London-born Adebowale was told to ‘disappear’ after he was caught up with a local gang known as the Woolwich Boys, and underwent a dramatic change of personality.

Once a fun-loving schoolboy who was described as ‘always smiling’ and chatted to neighbours about Jamie Oliver recipes, he began dressing in traditional Islamic dress and preaching a radical message of hate.

Shock: A friend of Adebowale, 22, who has known him from the age of 11, said today that he converted to Islam when he was aged around 19 

Adebowale gave up alcohol and began distributing radical leaflets near his mother’s home in Greenwich, south-east London.

Neighbours said his Nigerian-born mother, Juliet Obasuyi, was a probation officer and a ‘hard-working’ Christian woman who raised Adebowale alone after separating from his father.

Police raided her flat and a property linked to Adebowale’s father, Adeniyi Adebowale, in Holloway, North London.

Plain-clothes officers were seen carrying six plastic bags full of video cassettes and audio tapes from the Holloway flat.

The videos appeared to be labelled as football matches but one line of inquiry for police is likely to be whether Adebowale was interested in the type of jihadi videos watched by the July 2005 London bombers.

The four bombers were linked to an extreme bookshop in Leeds which distributed videos of terrorist acts, exhorting followers to emulate them.

Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale was born to Nigerian parents in Denmark Hill, South London, in May 1991. His father was then a student at Rutherford College in Canterbury, Kent, and the couple were said to have separated soon after the birth.

Adebowale attended Kidbrooke School in Greenwich, where former pupils said he was known as Toby or Tobi, an abbreviation of his second name Oluwatobi.

Luqman Ciise said on Twitter: ‘I knew him personally, he was normal, smiling all the time. His name was Toby. Still can’t believe this . . . How did he get radicalised?’

Adebowale was said to have converted to Islam at 19, while studying at Greenwich University, where he met the other Woolwich suspect, Michael Adebolajo.

Family friend Madeleine Edwards, 49, said Adebowale had been in ‘some serious gangland trouble’ in 2010 and that his mother had told her he ‘had to disappear for a while’.

She said Adebowale’s father was a ‘typical African gentleman’ but his mother had struggled to control her wayward son.

Adebowale was said to have left the Greenwich area for a year and returned about eight months ago, wearing traditional Islamic garb and a white skull cap, typically worn by Muslim men who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Michael would always say hello and play with my children, but in the last year he stopped. He would just ignore us when we saw him at the lift.

‘He used to talk to me very enthusiastically about cooking and his recipes. He loved Jamie Oliver and had his books.

‘But more recently, he would just put
 his head down when he saw me. Even if I tried to talk to him he was 
very dismissive. I thought it was weird.

‘It was odd as his mother was a devout Christian. And it seemed like such a sudden change.’

In recent months Adebowale had begun 
seeing a woman who had converted to Islam two years ago and wore a 
headscarf to cover her hair.

Armed police raided her flat, also in Greenwich, and led away two women and a 15-year-old boy, who witnesses said was handcuffed.

Two toddlers and a baby were also said to have been taken from the property.

Neighbours described hearing regular prayers and chanting from the flat.

A friend who has known Adebowale since he was 11 spoke of his shock at seeing the video of the Woolwich atrocity.

The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That wasn’t the same person.

‘He wasn’t someone monstrous, that was not the same person.

‘He converted to Islam, preaching Islam, preaching peace. Not preaching anything bad or anything negative. Just literally the ways of Islam.

‘I would see him going to mosque and coming back from mosque.

‘He was completely normal . . . He was one of us at school. Nothing evil about him at all.’

A father of two yesterday claimed the Woolwich fanatics were ‘looking for their chance to kill’ in the weeks before the death of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Paul Ramsamy, 46, said Michael Adebowale, 22, and Michael Adebolajo, 28, confronted him after mistaking him for a soldier because of his military-style clothing.

He claimed the pair stared at his camouflage trousers and army boots and followed him into an estate in Greenwich, south-east London, where he and Adebowale both live.

Mr Ramsamy, who has been married to his wife Francesse, 45, for 25 years, said: ‘I was coming home in the evening when I saw the two men come quickly towards me.

‘The men looked at my clothes and walked close behind me. They watched me. I could see their eyes on my shoes and they said something to each other that I didn’t understand.

‘I thought they were trying to come into the building but they didn’t walk in behind me. They looked very serious. I felt very scared.’

Mr Ramsamy, who has been a neighbour of Adebowale for four months, said he now feels lucky to be alive after seeing the two men in television reports as the attackers who butchered Drummer Rigby on Woolwich’s John Wilson Street on Wednesday.

He said he was shocked to recognise them as the same men who had pursued him.

‘Now I realise that they were looking for their chance to kill before Wednesday,’ he said. ‘If  I was a soldier, I would have been dead.

‘It could have happened to me because they could have made a mistake and thought I was a soldier, but they realised I wasn’t. I’m very lucky.’

He added: ‘Now before I wear military clothes I have to think twice – there could be more extremist men like them.’

Mr Ramsamy, who moved from Mauritius to the UK in 2003, said his family – including daughters Anna, 19, and Curtis, 15 – consider themselves British and feel angry at the hatred and venom of Adebolajo and Adebowale.

He said the two men should be imprisoned for life and their families should be deported.

‘I think they are very dangerous. People can’t kill people like Mr Rigby – especially people who work for society and dedicate their life to making this country a safer place.

‘Those kinds of people should go on trial and go to prison  for life. We have to send their families back to their  own countries.’
