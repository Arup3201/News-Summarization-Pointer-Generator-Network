Juventus monitoring Raheem Sterling's situation at Liverpool.

Interest from the Italian champions elect will come as little surprise as they look to strengthen further this summer, however, Liverpool still intend to hold onto their England international winger.

Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Paris St Germain and Bayern Munich are all among Sterling's admirers with offers of up to £50million expected to be made in the coming weeks.

Sterling and his advisors have told Liverpool they want to stave off discussions over a new contract until the close season and there is a risk he will not agree new terms with two years left to run on his current deal.

Juventus have made an offer for Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel of Zenit St Petersburg and they continue to field calls over midfielder Paul Pogba. 

They want at least £55m for Pogba and will attempt to use any funds from his prospective sale wisely with young players such as Sterling and Palermo's Paulo Dybala on their list.
