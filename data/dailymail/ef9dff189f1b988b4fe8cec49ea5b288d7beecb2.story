Three people have been arrested after dancing on the top of their SUV in the middle of a busy Chicago intersection.

The group of two men and one woman was traveling with four small children when they stopped in the intersection between LaSalle and Monroe streets in downtown Chicago on Thursday afternoon around 1:15pm.

The 59-year-old man, 36-year-old man and 27-year-old woman then clambered onto the roof along with the children and began to dance to Ellie Goulding's song Lights.

Dancing in the street: Passersby couldn't believe what they were seeing when a carload of people began dancing on the top of their car

Passersby stopped to watch the bizarre scene and several people caught footage of the group on camera phones.

The footage shows the Chevy Tahoe in the middle of the intersection with all its doors open. Atop its roof are the younger man and woman holding infants as well as the older man and two other small children.

The young woman, clad in a crop top and what look like pajama pants and holding a baby, appears to have words with a woman standing on the street.

Bizarre: Passersby are dressed warmly in coats and scarves but the adults on the car are wearing skimpy singlets

She waves at the woman and then gestures at her energetically before turning to caress the younger man and continue dancing; the woman on the street gives up and continues walking.

'Ooh that's so not safe,' a woman can be heard saying on the recording as a bus squeezes past the SUV.

Other footage captures a different woman exclaiming that one of the babies isn't even wearing socks in the chilly Chicago weather.

According to NBC Chicago, the group is from San Tan Valley in Arizona.

The three adults were taken into custody and charged with misdemeanour endangerment to a child.

The children are now in the care of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.
