A university science department is 
being investigated by police after a PhD student was exposed to deadly 
chemicals, it emerged last night.

The 25-year-old who attends 
Southampton University fell ill three weeks ago and was later found to 
have thallium and arsenic in their body.

It is not yet known how the chemicals entered the student’s body.

Exposed at uni lab: Southampton University's chemistry department is being probed by police after a 25-year-old student fell ill when they were exposed to deadly chemicals

Last night the university had closed 
some of its chemistry laboratories while police have launched a joint 
investigation with the Health and Safety Executive.

The student, who has not been named, is being treated at a specialist toxicology unit at a hospital in Cardiff, Wales.

‘It has already been established this 
does not relate to any leak or airborne emission from the buildings and 
is not transmittable and may not be connected with the University at 
all,’ said a police spokesman.

‘This is being treated as an isolated 
incident and staff and students at the University and other members of 
the public are not believed to be at risk.’ Staff and students at the 
university will now be given the option of voluntary screening if they 
feel they too are at risk.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete McGowan said: ‘We are keeping an open mind on how the student has been exposed to the chemicals and are investigating all scenarios at the moment.

‘We and the HSE are leading this enquiry and we have no reason to think that there is any risk to public health.’ The university’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Adam Wheeler, said: ‘Our thoughts are with our student and their family at this difficult time for them and our student support staff are providing further assistance.

‘The safety of our staff and students is of paramount importance to the University and we have proactively taken measures to ensure their health and well-being.

‘At part of this we are co-operating and taking advice form the relevant authorities.’
