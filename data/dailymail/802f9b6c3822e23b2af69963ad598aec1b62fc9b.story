An Afghanistan soldier and his nine-year-old daughter were reunited for the first time after a year on Thursday when she threw the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game where he was disguised as the catcher.

Alayna Adams, 9, of Dunedin, was invited to throw the first ball at Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday night.

Unknown to her, rather than the usual team catcher, the man behind the catcher's mask was actually her dad - who had been away serving in Afghanistan for a year.

Amazed: Alayna Adams, 9, of Dunedin, had no idea dad William was disguised as the catcher

Reunited: The father and daughter embraced just in front of home plate

A camera crew captured the heart-warming moment just after William Adams caught his daughter's toss before the game against the Boston Red Sox.

He stood up with the ball and peeled off his mask, causing his delighted daughter to run and leap into his arms just in front of the home plate.

The crowd cheered as the delighted little girl beamed over her dad's shoulder.

'For a second, I felt like it was a dream,' she said. 

The pair were joined by Alayna's mom and William's wife Dana, who also had no idea that her husband was home.

'I had no idea, and usually I pick up on things,' Dana told Fox Sports.

The elaborate surprise - which included William dressing in full Rays gear - was organized by United Service Organizations Inc, a nonprofit organization dedicated to U.S. troops and their families.

Just before the throw Alayna and the crowd were shown a video message from William which made out he was still in Afghanistan.

He had actually come over the night before and stayed in a hotel to maintain the secret.

'That was the hardest part,' he said. 'Being back home and not being able to see them.'

'Can't believe I'm finally back with the girls when there are still so many servicemen overseas. I was pretty excited.'
