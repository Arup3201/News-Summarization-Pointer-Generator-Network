Widow May Ward, 100, had been living at Meppershall Care Home for six years and was in good physical health for her age.

But in August 2010 she was being hoisted from a chair into her bed by two carers when she was accidentally dropped, falling 5ft on to her head and fracturing her skull.

The carers – Shasha Wei from China, and Rumyana Ivanova from Bulgaria – changed the great-grandmother’s bloody clothes and put her back into bed where she was left for 40 minutes before they called 999. She died in hospital the following day.

Killed: May Ward was being moved from her chair to her bed by a sling and hoist when she fell to the floor, but instead of calling for help nurses but the bloodied pensioner back in bed

An inquest in January this year heard staff had put Mrs Ward into a sling without attaching the correct straps to her legs.

Miss Wei and Miss Ivanova had not been trained to use the sling. They did not give evidence at the inquest because they have since returned to their respective home countries.

Bedfordshire Police said it had considered neglect charges but dropped the case due to ‘insufficient evidence’. The inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

Referring to Mrs Ward’s death in their report, the Care Quality Commission inspectors said the home had ‘not learnt from past mistakes’.

Inspectors found frail residents of Meppershall Nursing Home had been locked indoors for four months after a lift broke

The Health and Safety Executive later said it was investigating the case and coroner Edward Thomas wrote to the Care Quality Commission, asking it to ‘look more closely at care in homes’.

Mrs Ward, who had four grandchildren and six great grandchildren, had been living at Meppershall for six years before she was fatally injured.

The widow, whose husband William died in 1989, had previously run a country club and a pub in west London with her husband before taking over the Prince William Henry pub in Blackfriars, central London.

She been in good physical health for her age and just months before she was killed received a telegram from the Queen to mark her centenary.
