He has been the butt of more than a few jokes in recent weeks.

So it will do nothing to help Ed Miliband’s self-confessed image problems that it appears even children are now mocking him.

The Labour leader was yesterday dealt an embarrassing blow when a young boy sneaked up behind him and poked his tongue out during a media appearance.

The boy pulled off his prank behind the back of the unsuspecting politician after riding up on a toy scooter, much to the glee of onlookers.

Mr Miliband was posing for photographers with parliamentary candidate Sarah Owen while he spoke to residents during a visit to Hastings, East Sussex.

It comes after he batted off suggestions that he was bothered by his image problems during an appearance on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show last week.

 

It's not the first time Ed Miliband has been caught out when there's a camera about as his unfortunate attempt to eat a bacon sandwich showed

He laughed at cartoons comparing him to Wallace from the children’s animation films which Marr produced on air.

Marr asked: ‘Again and again and again, you are turned into a figure of fun, and you can’t ignore it. It must hurt, it must make you angry, surely?’

In fact, Mr Miliband is often caught out in the public eye

The Labour leader replied: ‘I think it makes me angry in the following sense: that I think the British people deserve a better debate than this.

‘This isn’t sort of C-list celebrity. This isn’t a sort of ugly persons’ showbiz contest.’

Last week, it was also revealed he is worried enough about his poor public image to have sought help from a world renowned expert on autism in addition to a voice coach.

Mr Miliband’s encounter yesterday is reminiscent of David Cameron’s embarrassment in 2007 when 17-year-old Ryan Florence was snapped making a rude gesture behind him.

The Prime Minister had previously been mocked for his so-called ‘hug-a-hoodie’ rhetoric, which had been seen as soft on crime.
