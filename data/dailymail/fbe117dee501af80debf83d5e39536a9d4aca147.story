Brendan Rodgers believes Thibaut Courtois was the main reason Chelsea reached the Capital One Cup final after his Liverpool side were dumped out after extra-time at Stamford Bridge.

After a brilliant performance in the first leg at Anfield, Courtois kept a clean sheet as Jose Mourinho's men advanced with a 1-0 victory (2-1 on aggregate) courtesy of Branislav Ivanovic's header.

Rodgers claimed his side were the better team over the two legs, despite failing to make it to Wembley.

He said: 'I'm very proud of the team, over the two legs we were the better side and their goalkeeper has got them to the final. At Anfield and here tonight he's made very, very important saves and that's won them the game.

'Obviously they got the goal at the beginning of extra-time but that was irrelevant - we knew we needed to score tonight and the players gave everything. They're dead on their feet at the end. 

'We pressed, worked hard, played fantastic football and created chances to win the game but unfortunately we were not clinical enough.'

Diego Costa appeared to stamp on Emre Can during the first half, caught Martin Skrtel with his studs in the second period and then clashed with Reds skipper Steven Gerrard.

Asked about Costa's clashes, Rodgers said: 'These things happen but I don't think anyone watching likes to see what Diego Costa's done, not just on (Martin) Skrtel, but also on Can, a young player who is clearly stamped on. 

'It's easy to land somewhere else without having to land directly on an opponent's ankle and it's disappointing to see on the replay. He's very fortunate the linesman and referee didn't see that.'

Rodgers decided to leave Daniel Sturridge out despite the striker's return to training, although he is hopeful he will see some action against West Ham on Saturday.

'It was too soon for this game but we really relish him coming into the team,' said Rodgers. 

'He's worked very hard to get back and trained with the team. Hopefully by the weekend he can play some part.'
