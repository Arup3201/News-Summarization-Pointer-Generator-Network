Aiden Elmore has been jailed for 21 years after setting light to a block of flats, killing a 68-year-old man

A jilted boyfriend who killed a pensioner when he burned down a block of flats because he was upset about being dumped has been jailed for life.

Aiden Elmore, 21, went on an arson spree just hours after his girlfriend Lauren Wellings, 17, broke up with him by text.

He went on the rampage in Willenhall, near Walsall setting fire to gardens before pushing a blazing wheelie bin against a block of flats barricading the exit.

Pensioner Victor Moore, 68, became trapped in the communal hallway of the building as the devastating blaze took grip - reaching temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees.

The external doors were fused shut due to the heat and Mr Moore tragically died after being overcome by the heavy fumes on October 8 last year.

Other locals were forced to jump from the flats to save their lives while one resident described the heat as though they were 'on top of a bonfire'.

After igniting the blaze drunken Elmore - who had been drowning his sorrows over the split all day - set two more fires including one outside his ex-partner’s mother’s house.

Elmore pushed wheelie bins up against patio windows before lighting them - but passing police officers spotted eight-foot-high flames before the fire could spread through the house.

Police officers flooded the area on the lookout for the arsonist and at 4.10am a 'shaking and nervous' Elmore was arrested wandering along a nearby street.

He claimed to officers he had burned his own tracksuit top bought by his ex as a Father’s Day gift and the flames had spread.

But when confronted with CCTV evidence showing him igniting the bins he admitted being reckless but denied intending to harm anyone.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Elmore, 21, went on the arson spree just hours after his then girlfriend Lauren Wellings, 17, dumped him via text message

After a four-week trial Wolverhampton Crown Court Elmore was found guilty of murder and two counts of arson with intent to endanger life by a jury.

Judge John Warner told him he must serve at least 21 years behind bars before he is considered for release, adding that it was a matter of chance that more victims were caught in the blaze.

He also handed the killer separate eight and 11-year sentences for each arson offence, to run concurrently.

Passing sentence Judge Warner said Elmore had created
 a scene of 'fear and panic' in which people could be heard screaming 
and were forced to escape through windows.

He told Elmore: 'Quite what your motive was for what you did remains a mystery to me.

'Only you know what your thinking was and you have not yet chosen to say.

'It was purely a matter of chance that Mr Moore was the only person to lose his life in that horrific fire.'

Elmore, who was on 
bail at the time of the murder in October 2012, smirked at members of 
the public from the dock before the start of the sentencing hearing.

Judge Warner commended the bravery of two gas engineers, a police officer and a member of the public who attended the scene.

'They went there in the course of their employment or they went there in a public-spirited effort to assist,' the judge said.

'On behalf of the community they deserve commendation for their actions that night.'

In
 a victim impact statement read to the court, an unnamed relative of Mr 
Moore said: 'There are no words that will describe how my family feel 
and he did not deserve to die in the way that he died.'

Detective Sergeant Mick Ross, from 
West Midlands Police, said: 'Elmore had been drinking, taking drugs and 
was emotional after separating from his partner.

'But his actions were a clear attempt to cause serious harm - and he will now spend the next 21 years behind bars.

'Elmore
 positioned bins against doors, barring residents’ likely exit route and
 forcing people to jump for their lives from windows.

'He
 did the same again in Wychbold Close where only the brave actions of 
police officers stopped the blaze spreading into the property; there 
were young children at the address and the officers’ actions may well 
have saved more lives.

'Elmore
 made a determined effort to light the bins: CCTV showed him trying to 
light the rubbish for around 20 minutes before it finally took hold.

'It’s
 understood vengeance over the split led him to target the home in 
Wychbold Close, but it’s still unclear why he sparked the fire that cost
 Mr Moore his life.'

Residents were forced to jump from their flats as one described the heat and situation as 'like being on top of a bonfire'. One woman was taken to hospital with a broken ankle after her leap to safety

During his trial the court heard how father-of-one Elmore had been dumped by his girlfriend Lauren by text three hours before his arson spree.

Giving evidence she told the court: 'We were speaking quite a bit on the night.

'We were talking about getting back together.

'But at about 10.30pm I messaged him saying we were over for good.'

Elmore, from Wolverhampton, then spent the night of October 8 drinking all night at a local pub.

During the blaze, one woman was taken to hospital with a broken ankle having jumped from a window.

Around 50 people were evacuated over fears of an explosion as several blazing bins had been placed near a gas main behind the maisonettes.
