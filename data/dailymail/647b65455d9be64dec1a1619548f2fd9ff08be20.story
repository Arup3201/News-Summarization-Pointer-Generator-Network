The last letter written by  murdered British surgeon Abbas Khan from his Syrian prison cell proves that he was not suicidal, his family said today.

Syrian officials claim the 32-year-old father-of-two hanged himself just days before he was due to be freed on the order of President Bashar al-Assad.

But the doctor’s family have ridiculed the suggestion and say he was looking forward to Christmas with them.

Family: Dr Abbas Khan's children Rurayya, seven, and Abdullah, six, (all pictured) had finally been preparing for his return when Syrian authorities told the family he had hanged himself in his cell

Claim: Syrian officials claim the 32-year-old father-of-two hanged himself just days before he was due to be freed on the order of President Bashar al-Assad

Determination: In this letter, written a few days before his death, Dr Khan thanks his family and friends for keeping pressure on the Syrian regime to release him after a year in prison

His family had been campaigning for his release and in the letter, dated December 7, he told them: ‘To everyone! Good work guys, seems they are now responding to the threat of a foreign delegation.

‘But keep up the pressure. We don’t want to lose the Christmas period “window”. Till I’m not released – I’m not free! They can release me immediately if they want.’ 

His sister Sara Khan, 23, said: ‘He was not sat there saying, “I will rot here.” He is not sat there moping, he wants to come home. He is advising us. That just shows he did not commit suicide. He was coming home to his family . . . to his children.’

Dr Khan, an orthopaedic surgeon from south London, was arrested in November last year near the frontline city of Aleppo only 48 hours after he crossed the border from Turkey without a visa to help treat civilians in a field hospital.

Heartfelt: Abbas Khan's daughter Rurayya, seven, begs Prime Minister David Cameron to 'please, help our Dad. Please, Please, Help!!!'

Loss of life: Dr Abbas Khan, 32, pictured with his son Abdullah, had spent more than a year in jail

Touching: Abbas Khan's daughter Rurayya, seven, tells her father she wants him to 'come back very soon and safely', before signing off: 'You are my star'

He was beaten and tortured while being held in an underground cell, and at one point his weight dropped to five stone. He was due to be released this weekend in a ‘Christmas-time gesture’ by Assad.

Dr Khan’s children Rurayya, seven, and Abdullah, six, had finally been preparing for his return when, on Tuesday, Syrian authorities told the family he had hanged himself in his cell with his pyjamas.

Tonight Dr Khan’s mother Fatima told ITV News: ‘They [the Syrian government] take out all of their anger with the British Government by killing a minor person who did not kill an ant in his life.’

The Foreign Office, whom the family have accused of ‘betrayal’ for not doing enough in the case, has said the ‘extremely suspicious’ death amounts to murder.

Claims: The final letter written by a British surgeon who died in a Syrian jail proves he did not commit suicide, his sister said today

Help: British surgeon Dr Abbas Khan, pictured, went to Syria with medical supplies to care for wounded children caught up in the civil war

Betrayal: Dr Abbas Khan's brother Afroze, left, and sister Sara, right, say the Foreign Office failed to act quickly

Syrian authorities claim their post-mortem showed Dr Khan, a hand and nerve specialist, killed himself and they say X-rays show no sign of mistreatment. They added that the family can carry out their own autopsy in Damascus.

But one of Dr Khan’s brothers, Shahnawaz, said the family suspected the Syrians were trying to delay the release of the body. They want it returned immediately for a post-mortem in the UK.

Sara Khan said her brother’s wife, Hana, 30, had not yet been able to tell the children that their father has died. ‘Words cannot describe what she is feeling.’

She added that Dr Khan had not planned to go to Syria, but took a sabbatical to work in refugee camps in Turkey.

Humanitarian: Dr Abbas Khan, pictured with his six-year-old son Abdullah, travelled to travelled to Syria to treat wounded children only to die just four days before he was due to be released from prison

Taken: Abbas's mother Fatima, pictured with Dr Khan, right, and his brother Afroze, left, in London in 1996, travelled to Syria to find her son, but never saw him freed

She said: ‘People were crossing the border with broken limbs and he knew he could help.

‘There was no religious element to his decision. He just could not just sit by and watch.’

Dr Khan was told by his daughter Rurayya in a letter that she wanted him to 'come back very soon and safely', before signing off: 'You are my star'.

Rurayya also wrote a letter begging Prime Minister David Cameron to 'Please help our Dad. Please, please help!!!'
