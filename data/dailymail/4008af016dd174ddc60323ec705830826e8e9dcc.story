It was a scene straight out of The Simpsons, played out in real life.

The father of  eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry would have been forgiven for shouting out Homer Simpson's classic catchphrase D'oh! after realising what his cheeky son had done.

Theo had been regularly using the family iPad to play The Simpsons game Tapped Out and often bought the virtual doughnuts on offer to help progress through the game.

Expensive: Nick and Lisa Rowland-Fry were left furious after their eight-year-old son ran up a £1,000 bill after buying virtual doughnuts on an iPad Simpsons game. Mr Rowland-Fry and son Theo are pictured

However, little did the eager youngster know that he was racking up an enormous £980 bill for his parents. 

Nick and Lisa Rowland-Fry, from Bristol, only realised that their son had spent the huge amount after their bank account had been completely cleared.

Mr Rowland-Fry, an estate agent, said: 'It was only when my wife rang me and asked where all the money had gone that we found out what had happened.

'She got a statement and saw there were more than 100 purchases on iTunes for between £1.50 and £75, from the middle of January and the beginning of this month.

'We received no emails alerting us to what was happening.'

Mr Rowland-Fry said it is too easy for children to buy additional items without being asked for any more details to confirm the purchase.

Pricey: Theo Rowland-Fry decided he needed extra help to progress on his Simpsons iPad game Tapped Out and thought nothing of buying the virtual doughnuts on offer

He said: 'Theo is only just eight and has no real concept of the monetary value attached.

'As far as he was concerned he was just buying doughnuts.

'We know others caught out by the same thing. A friend's little girl spent £350 on a horse game.

'One add-on was £69.95 for a little diamond to go in the horse's mane. It's outrageous.

'iPads can be great for keeping them occupied but there has to be more control.

'If you buy something on Amazon you have to agree to pay for it, enter additional information to pay and then get a confirmation email so you can keep track. With the iPad it seems to be a free-for-all.

'I appreciate children are their target audience but it is not right and there needs to be specific controls in place to stop this from happening.

'I dread to think how many people this has happened to and how many it has happened to and they don't even know about it because perhaps it was £50 and they didn't realise.'

Furious: Theo's parents were left astonished to find that their son had completely cleared their bank account by racking up a £980 bill on the game, pictured

The family have now been refunded, having spent almost an hour on the phone to Apple representatives in America -  but the iPad, for now, remains in a drawer.

A spokesman for Apple said such incidents should be reported as soon as possible and were then looked at on a case-by-case basis.

He said it was vital people kept their pass code, designed to stop unauthorised electronic purchases on its products, safe and said software was available to prevent children from using the iTunes store even if they have the password.

He said: 'I explained exactly what had happened and it was a nervous wait but they agreed to refund it in the circumstances.

Pricey: Danny Kitchen, 5, ran up a huge bill on the iPad app Zombie vs Ninja

The one saving grace for Theo is that he is not the first youngster to amass a huge amount of money on his parents' computer.

Last month, five-year-old Danny 
Kitchen, from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software 
to help him play the game Zombie.

Danny had asked his father for a passcode to download a game called Zombies v Ninja, which involves touching the iPad screen to aim ninja-style weapons at cartoon zombies.

His parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at their home.

But by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’. He bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time.

His parents were refunded after they contacted Apple.

The problem is of increasing concern in the U.S. It emerged last month that Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents in America whose children run up massive bills using its free apps.

Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families.

A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency.

Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).

'We got Theo and his sister Evie an iPad to help with their schoolwork but Theo's is away in a drawer at the moment. We just don't have time to monitor what they are playing.'

Last month, five-year-old Danny Kitchen made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombie.

His parents were also refunded after they contacted Apple.

A statement on Apple's website reads: 'All iOS devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod touch) have built in parental controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content, eg internet access and age-rated content such as music, games, apps, TV shows, movies etc.

'Parental controls also give parents and guardians the option to turn off functionality such as purchasing from iTunes and the ability to turn off in-app purchases.

'Our parents' guide to iTunes details the steps and measures parents and guardians can take to make sure younger players have access to the right content. The first thing we recommend is not to share your password.'
