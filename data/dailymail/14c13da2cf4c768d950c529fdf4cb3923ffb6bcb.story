She is the little girl with long golden hair just like the fairytale heroine Rapunzel.

At just six-years-old Sophie Fieldhouse has grown her beautiful blonde locks until they reach almost to the ground.

But she also has a rare and potentially lethal form of diabetes called congenital hyperinsulinism.

Sophie Fieldhouse has a rare disease (a potentially lethal form of diabetes) that was diagnosed when she was 18-months-old and the treatment she receives has the side effect of making her hair grow

It causes low blood sugar and one of the
 only treatments for it is a drug called Diazoxide, which makes her hair
 grow much quicker than normal.

Sophie was diagnosed with the condition, which affects one in 50,000 people,Â  when she was just 18-months-old.

Sophie, from Failsworth, is one of just over a dozen children with the condition who took park in the new trial using fish oils

Six-year-old Sophie Fieldhouse from failsworth has had fish oil trials by Manchester University to help with her rare and potentially lethal form of diabetes

Some of six-year-old Sophie Fieldhouse's schoolmates have been unkind about her long hair without realising that the growth is caused by her medicine she takes for her rare form of diabetes

The name covers a variety of conditions in which hypoglycaemia (literally: low blood sugar) is caused by excessive insulin secretion.Sufferers are born with the disease although less severe forms may not become apparent until adulthood.Mild cases are treated merely by eating frequently; more severe ones require medication and very severe cases may need surgery to remove part or most of the pancreas to protect the brain from damage due to recurrent hypoglycaemia.

They were given supplements of fish oils in the form of capsules similar to cod liver oil.

The new treatment has proved so successful that Sophie is no longer taking Diazoxide.

Her mum Amanda Turner, 37, said: "The condition is scary because when Sophie's blood sugar is low she we see a complete change in her.

'It's like looking at a completely different child. She gets very hungry and gets the shakes. She has to take extra snacks to school and her hair is also very long because of the treatment.

'Children have said things to her about her hair without realising it and it isn't a nice thing to have, but the school have been very good.'

'This new trial has been brilliant and we have now been able to stop the Diazoxide, which is fantastic.

'We just hope that this treatment will soon be available to all children with congenital hyperinsulinism.'
