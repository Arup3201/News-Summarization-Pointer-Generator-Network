Supermarkets are slashing the cost of champagne this Christmas with bottles of bubbly are on offer for as little as £8.

Many are touting quality wines and champagnes at half-price in an attempt to compete with budget retailers like Ali and Lidl.  

Asda sparked the price war by cutting the price of Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to just £10, giving customers almost a 60% saving with an offer that runs until January 1.

Tesco responded by knocking two-thirds off the official list price of award-winning Louis Delaunay champagne - from £25.99 to only £8, making it the cheapest on offer in Britain until the deal expired on December 2.  

The drink, which comes from the town of Dizy, in the Champagne region of France, has strong floral aromas and an elegant citrus flavour.

This summer, it won a bronze medal at International Wine & Spirit Competition – an event considered the Oscars for the wine and champagne industry.

Tesco's champagne buyer Charlie Craven said: 'This is a quality, award-winning champagne and to find something this good for £8 on British high streets you'd have to go back at least 10 years.

'We're delighted that we can bring this to our customers at such a fantastic price.' 

And many major shops are offering deals on Moet & Chandon, including Sainsbury's who have discounted the popular bubbly by £10 - from £35 to £25. 

Morrisons is offering Nicolas Feuillatte Brut champagne for half price, slashing the cost from £29.99 to £14.99.

Discount emporiums Aldi and Lidl's cut-price bubbly has sent the cost of champagne to a ten-year low. 

This year has seen the cut-price retailers attract new shoppers with delicacies and luxury ranges offered at bargain prices. 

Aldi's bargain Veuve Monsigny, priced £9.99 and Lidl's cheap Comte de Senneval at £11.99 flew off the shelves, but also saw favourable reviews.  

Suppliers fear the loss-leading tactics are unsustainable and have no bearing on the cost price of champagne

But a leading supplier has hit out at the loss-leading tactics, adding champagne is being held 'hostage' in the bubbly price wars.

Julie Campos, managing director designate at Nicolas Feuillatte, told Off Licence News: 'I had difficulty believing Tesco was selling champagne for £8. 

'I had to go to the shop to see it for myself. It was obviously being sold at a loss. 

'Selling champagne at £8 a bottle has no bearing on the cost price. It's extremely misleading to the consumer.

'Champagne has become a bit of a hostage. The retail market is not expanding so the only way to improve figures is to grow market share.'

Ms Campos explained that tactics employed by rival retailers are not sustainable and send the wrong message to consumers. 

She added: 'There has been a tendency in the past few years to cut prices on a few key products, such as champagne, to get consumers in the door, even if you sell at a loss. It attracts consumer attention, but it's dangerous for champagne.

'How long can it continue? It's not sustainable and it sends the wrong message to the consumer.'

She added: 'There's nothing we can do. It's illegal to sell at a loss in France but not in the UK. 

'It's a very touchy issue, because consumer spending power is down and making popular things cheaper doesn't get attacked - it's popular politically to do it.

'It's unfair on the companies that spend years investing in the vineyards and cellars and ageing the wines to deliver year-on-year quality, and spending a lot of money on marketing, to have people come in on the back of all that and sell it at a loss, it's frustrating to say the least.'
