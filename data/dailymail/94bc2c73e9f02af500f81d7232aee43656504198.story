White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest had a quote from President Barack Obama about ISIS being 'jayvee' level terrorists thrown back in his face by a reporter today, hours after the U.S. launched air strikes on the Islamic militants in Iraq.

Speaking about ISIS to The New Yorker in January, Obama said: 'The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, 
is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe 
Bryant.'

Asked today by CNN reporter Jim Acosta if the president still thinks ISIS is an amateur terrorist group, Earnest dribbled around the question before claiming that the White House does 'remain concerned about the military proficiency that's been demonstrated' by Islamic militants in Iraq.

'Is it safe to say that ISIS - they're no longer the jayvees': White House spokesman Josh Earnest had the president's brassy comment that ISIS was the equivalent of a jayvee basketball team thrown back in his face today

'There is no question that 
the Laker uniforms that were worn - . . . to draw out that analogy a 
little bit - that were worn by the Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan 
has been decimated and defeated in Afghanistan,' Earnest said.

'There's no question about that,' he added.

Earnest said it 'also true' that there are other terrorist networks that 'subscribe to the violent extremist ideology that's espoused and promulgated by Al Qaeda.'

'Many of those groups, in nations across the globe, are not particularly sophisticated, are focused on local sectarian conflicts that don't pose a significant or immediate threat to U.S. interests or the U.S. homeland.'

'There are of course a couple other organizations that do pose a more substantial threat to the United States and our interests,' he continued.

Among those, he admitted, are the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, also known as ISIL, a militant group that was expelled from the Al Qaeda because of its ultra violent practices.

'We do remain concerned about the military proficiency that's been demonstrated by ISIL, and it's why you've seen the president take steps, including the authorization of military force that would protect American citizens who might be harmed by ISIL,' Earnest said.

The statement was a near 180 degree turn about from the president's earlier claim that ISIS wasn't a terrorist group worth taking seriously.

Since then ISIS has barreled through Iraq, destroying towns and murdering civilians. Since the extremists began its rampage they have taken over 17 towns, including the city of Mosul. Most recently the Islamists took control of the dam there - Iraq's largest - giving it control over a significant amount of water and electricity.

As many as 200,000 religious minorities have fled from their homes in recent days to the mountains or refugee camps in the nearby town of Erbil, the capitol of the independent region of Kurdistan, after ISIS threatened them with death if they did not convert to Islam.

More than 40,000 followers of the Yadizi religion escaped to Mount Sinjar, where they remained hidden away for several days without food or water until the U.S. air dropped supplies last night.

The U.S. also dropped two 500-pound bombs on ISIS artillery stockpiles just outside of Erbil in an effort to stop the humanitarian crisis from turning into 'genocide.'

'For anyone who needs a wake up call, this is it,' Secretary of State John Kerry said this morning.
