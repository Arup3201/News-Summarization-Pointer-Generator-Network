Steven Gerrard may have thousands of screaming fans in Brazil and many millions more on TV as he leads England in their hunt for World Cup glory, but his greatest inspiration comes in a single image.

The England captain will have a picture of his own three lions - daughters Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes - in their England kits on him at all times in Brazil.

Gerrard and his wife, Alex, posed for pictures with their children for Hello! magazine before he joined up with the national team.

Alex told Hello!: ‘All the girls have the England and new Liverpool kits with their names on the back, just like their daddy. They are so cute!

Poster boy: Gerrard, his wife Alex and their daughters feature on the cover of Hello!

‘Steven has taken a picture of them on his phone so he has it with him. Lourdes loves hers so much we can't get it off her, though. She wants to sleep in her England kit and cries if I try to take it off her when I'm dressing her for nursery.’

Gerrard left his girls behind this week as Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad ramp up Cup preparations in Miami ahead of friendlies against Ecuador on Wednesday and Honduras on Saturday ahead of their opening group D clash with Italy in Manaus on June 14 (11pm).

The England squad hit an early hurdle when their first training
 session at their Miami base at Barry University was scuppered by inclement weather - it's the second day of the hurricane season - and they were forced to train in the gym.

Speaking 
to the women's magazine, Gerrard made no qualms about the honour he 
considered leading his country's hopes into the World Cup.

He said: ‘It's what dreams are made of. The plan is to come back and make the country proud of the team.’
