Security forces picked through the scene of a devastating blast in Afghanistan today after two suicide bombers managed to set off a bomb in Kabul's diplomatic district.

Bloodstains and body parts were left 
strewn across the rubble after two guards were killed and five civilians 
were injured in the blast. The two suicide bombers also died.

Armed guards stationed near the target, a U.S. base, had spotted the two men making their way on foot to the compound and opened fire immediately. But it was already too late.

The militants detonated their suicide vests and an explosion ripped through a wall at the base. Remains of their apparatus, including ammunition and part of a vest were recovered from the scene.

Scorch marks: The wall surrounding a U.S. military base in Kabul is left wrecked after a suicide bomber blew himself up. Today, U.S. forces and Afghan security officials began the task of piecing together what happened

His
 equipment: Ammunition including a grenade launcher, a gun and part of 
the exploded vest of a suicide attacker. Police in Kabul said they were 
on foot and were spotted by Afghan security guards as they approached 
Camp Eggers

The blast reverberated around Kabul's 
Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood shortly after 8am local time. An alarm 
started going off at the nearby U.S. embassy, warning staff to take 
cover.

The neighbourhood is
 also home to many high-ranking Afghan officials, international 
organisations and the headquarters of the international military 
coalition.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing in an email to reporters.

The attack came as foreign and Afghan forces tightened security around the capital ahead of the holy day of Ashoura on Saturday, when Shiite Muslims commemorate the seventh century death of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Mohammed's grandson.

Last year, the commemoration saw the first major sectarian attack since the fall of the Taliban regime.

In
 that strike, a suicide bomber on foot detonated his vest amid scores of
 worshippers at a Shiite shrine, killing 56 people and wounding more 
than 160 others.

Today's bombers were on foot and were
 spotted by Afghan security guards as they approached Camp Eggers, the 
Kabul police chief's office said.

High security: The Taliban shortly after claimed responsibility for the suicide attack 
in the Afghan capital, saying its fighters had targeted a U.S. 
intelligence office

The
 police fired on the attackers and they detonated their vests. Two 
Afghan security guards were killed and five civilians were injured in 
the explosion.

Video of the scene shows what looks like an undetonated suicide vest, suggesting not all the explosives went off.

An international coalition vehicle was
 also damaged in the attack but there were no initial reports of 
casualties among the foreign forces, said Jamie Graybeal, a Nato troops 
spokesman.

Police had 
already set up extra checkpoints around Kabul and specifically near 
shrines to search cars and people in the run-up to the Ashoura.

'All our police units are in the first security alert position,' General Mohammad Daoud Amin, the city's deputy police chief, said yesterday.

'We are at the service of the people and doing our best to provide good security and prevent any possible incident on Ashoura.'
