A New York couple claim doctors 'stole' their daughter after the 19-year-old cheerleader went into hospital with stomach pains and came out with permanent brain damage, unable to move or communicate.

Giulio and Iris Ferraro are suing Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow where they claim staff were 'careless' and 'negligent' in anesthetizing their daughter, Raina Ferraro, ahead of a straight-forward endoscopy in January.

According to the lawsuit, the bubbly teen unexpectedly went into cardiac arrest during the procedure, which allowed doctors to look inside her stomach using a flexible microscope, and she was left in a vegetative state.

'I feel like we've walked into the "Twilight Zone,"' the teen's father told the New York Daily News. 'They stole my daughter from me.'

In the lawsuit, to be filed in Westchester Supreme Court today, Giulio and 
Iris Ferraro claim that doctors failed to consider 
Raina's height and weight when they gave her the anesthesia on January 11.

They also allege that medical staff improperly monitored her vital signs, excessively inflated their daughter's abdomen causing cardiac and respiratory arrest, 
and removed a breathing tube prematurely.

The parents claim that the hospital never explained to them why their 
previously active, healthy daughter was now unable to move or even talk 
to them.

Raina's devastated mother said she's still struggling to come to terms with what happened to her once vivacious daughter.

'I'm waiting for her to wake up and say, "Hi Mommy, letâ€™s go shopping,' she told the Daily News.

Giulio Ferraro, a cable TV 
technician, estimated that the cost of his daughter's care has already 
passed $1 million. The couple are suing for unspecified damages that will cover the cost of looking after their now entirely dependent daughter for the rest of her life.

A Facebook group, Friends of Raina, has been set up to support her family and has 487 likes.

The group reported that Raina had been crying as she realized what had happened to her.

Her cheerleading team have been raising money for her fund in the half time of basketball games at the Chester Academy, where Raina graduated in June 2012, and her friends threw a charity bowl-athon fundraiser in March.

Prior to the horror surgery, the 19-year-old had just earned her cosmetology certificate from the BOCES CTEC program and was awaiting her license from New York State to begin practicing.

According to the Daily News, the New York state Health Department has launched an investigation into the incident in response to a complaint filed by the Ferraro family.

The hospital said today that confidentiality laws mean it cannot comment on the case.
