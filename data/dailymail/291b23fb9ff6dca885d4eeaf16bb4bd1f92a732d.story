No one likes having to relive their embarrassing moments caught on camera.

But when a video of the President of Tajikistan dancing and singing out-of-tune surfaced on YouTube, the leader decided to take matters into his own hands.

The website was banned across the country for more than a week.

The cringe-inducing video of President Emomali Rahmon was filmed at his son's wedding in 2007, but posted on YouTube on May 18 this year.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Celebration: President Emomali Rahmon is caught on film dancing and singing at his son's wedding

Embarrassing: The President waves his arms wildly during the candid video posted on YouTubeÂ 

Hands up who's having fun: Authorities in Tajikistan banned YouTube for more than a week when this video appeared on the site

His off-key vocal performance and enthusiastic strutting quickly became an internet hit and the four-and-a-half minute clip, entitled 'Drunk Tajik President Sings a Song', quickly notched up almost 300,000 views.

Wrapping an arm round a fellow guest, Rahmon takes to the microphone with enthusiasm.

Occasionally, the camera cuts to his son and daughter-in-law who appear to be watching on painfully.

Coincidentally, Tajik authorities 
decided to cut access to YouTube, as well as the independent central 
Asian channel K+, which originally published the clip, on May 18.

The country has a population of around 8million but only 2million are thought to have internet access.

Sweet sounds: The off-key vocal performance has been met with a mixture of admiration and ridicule by the Tajik public

On May 27, when the embargo was lifted, the country's communications ministry confirmed the ban, but refused to elaborate on the reason why it had been imposed.

The video has sparked national debate after an extended version was posted by well-known Tajik exile Dodojon Atavulloev on his Facebook page with political commentary.

Atavulloev, who now lives in Hamburg, compared Rahmon's performance to a scene from a Bollywood film and also pointed out that the extravagant celebration contradicts a number of nation's laws which restrict the number of guests at a wedding and the length of celebrations.

Public opinion in Tajikistan is said to have been divided between those who admire the leader for demonstrating a human side versus those offended by his extravagance in what is a predominantly Muslim country.
