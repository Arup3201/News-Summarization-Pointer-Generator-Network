David Cameron has dropped his pledge to enshrine the Government's commitment to aid spending in law - after failing to convince Tory MPs.

The Prime Minister wanted to make it legally binding for Britain to spend 0.7% of the country's income - around £1 in every £142 - on foreign aid.

But Nick Clegg revealed this morning that Mr Cameron had failed to win round his own MPs and will not include the bill in the Queen's Speech next Wednesday.

David Cameron has consistently backed increased spending on foreign aid - insisting that the Government would not 'balance the books on the backs of the world's poor' - but has backed down in the face of growing Tory resistance

Nick Clegg shrugged off last week's disastrous council and European election results to come out fighting for a legally-binding commitment to foreign aid spending this morning

The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'The commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our nation’s wealth on aid, and also to enshrine this in law, will be in the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto.

'As of last year, we are spending 0.7 per cent, and that is a huge achievement.

'It’s an open secret that the Liberal Democrats wanted to take the additional step of legislating – which is why it’s in the Coalition Agreement.

'As you know we have not been able to convince our Coalition partners to do that, but the Liberal Democrats have not given up – we are going to keep pushing to get 0.7 per cent into law.'

A senior Lib Dem source blamed the decision to drop the aid pledge on Tory MPs.

He said: ‘It is no secret that this was not a popular policy on the backbenches of the Conservative party and we were very keen on it.

‘It was in our manifesto and in the coalition agreement. Some at the top of the Conservative party still remain convinced it’s the right thing to do, but it won’t be in the Queen’s Speech.’

Tory MP Peter Bone welcomed the decision to drop the planned legislation, but said the aid budget should also be cut.

Mr Bone said: ‘I am delighted that we are dropping the idea of fixing this ridiculous target in law but we are still spending far too much.

‘At a time when virtually every other government department is having to drastically cut back their budgets we are spending billions more on aid in order to meet an arbitrary target that is nothing more than a sticking plaster. We shouldn’t be shovelling money out of the door at the end of the year in order to meet a target – it should be based on need.

‘And if we really want to help the world’s poor the single biggest thing we could do is open up trade, but the EU blocks that to protect French farmers.

Mr Clegg reveled that the Government would be dropping the aid target in a speech this morning on International Development.

The Deputy Prime Minister lashed out at the 'myths' that had developed around aid spending.

Mr Clegg said: 'The British public believe that around 20 per cent of all the money the UK Government spends in a year goes on foreign aid.

'In reality, we spend 0.7 per cent of our nation’s income. That in itself is an historic achievement - we are now the first of the world’s wealthiest countries to meet this long-held promise.'

'It is still a lot of money. But, to put it into some kind of perspective, it’s less than what we spend on takeaways every year.'

Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems will make it a manifesto commitment to make aid spending legally binding

He said it was not true the cash was used to 'line the pockets of corrupt officials overseas'.

Mr Clegg said: 'It’s simply not the case that people’s taxes are frittered away, wasted on irrelevant projects or problems we cannot solve.'

The Deputy PM added: 'The things we do with this money are also clearly in Britain’s own interests too: making our people safer and more prosperous.

'When Pakistan can’t prevent young men getting radicalised and trained by militants within its borders, that can lead to terrorist attacks on our streets.

'When Somalia can’t tackle the problem of piracy, it disrupts the trade routes of UK businesses.'

He said: 'So let the aid sceptics – UKIP and others on the right - continue to campaign against these efforts. Their cynicism is, I believe, out of step with our national interest and with the compassion we feel as a country towards those who are suffering elsewhere.

'They might want to sneer at the generosity of the British people. I lead a party that believes we should celebrate it.'

Mr Clegg said there were 'millions that still have to live on less than £1 a day'.

He said he disagreed with those who say we should leave Nigeria - Africa’s richest country to 'sort out its own problems'.

Mr Clegg said: 'One in ten of the world’s poor now live in Nigeria. One in six of the world’s children not in school are in Nigeria.

'The situation is particularly bleak in the North, where living conditions are as tough as in any warzone. Targeted attacks by Boko Haram on vaccination centres threaten a polio epidemic across the region. And just last week, the country was hit by a wave of bombing attacks.

'What Nigeria shows us is that you can’t judge a country’s progress by its economic statistics alone.'

He said he did not back a rule to 'arbitrarily cut off our help when a country hits a certain GDP target'.
