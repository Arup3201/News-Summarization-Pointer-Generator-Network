If you're even  the slightest bit scared of heights you might want to look away now.

A seemingly fearless acrobat performs a record triple flip after leaping from a 180ft crane, the equivalent of 25 stories up, in the latest extreme sport craze - freedropping.

Greg Roe, a Russian born Canadian, performed the incredible stunt in Innsbruck, Austria, landing safely on a giant inflatable airbag.

Geronimo: Greg Roe, a Russian born Canadian, launches himself of a platform 180ft up to begin his incredible triple flip stunt 

Freedropping, which sees sees enthusiasts jumping from extreme heights onto large safety airbags performing twists, flips and turns as they drop, has exploded in popularity over the past few years.

Mr Roe said: 'I simply wanted to try something new. I wanted to test my skills where they had never been tested before.'

Mr Roe's jump - his latest in a long line of never before performed tricks - is just one pulled by the freedrop acrobat during the adrenaline-fuelled session.

He added: 'I have to make sure I land perfectly in the centre of my back each time I jump. I am falling too fast for another landing to be safe.

'I am a trained professional so I can stay safe even at extreme heights.'

Mr Roe, who trained as an Olympic level trampolinist, said he has been able to translate those traditional skills onto a bigger stage.

Each jump poses a number of challenges.

Freedropping is the latest extreme sport craze coming in the wake of bungee jumping, where people jump from high bridges attached to an elasticated cord and base-jumping where people parachute jump from tall buildings or cliffs.
