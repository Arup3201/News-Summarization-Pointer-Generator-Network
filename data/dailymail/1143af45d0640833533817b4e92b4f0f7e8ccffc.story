An NFL player who was riding his scooter in Miami, Florida, on Saturday night reportedly told the police officers who pulled him over they stopped him because he is 'a black man with dreads'.

Officers reported New Orleans Saints cornerback Brian Dixon was traveling down the center of the road, passing other vehicles and swerving on his white scooter around 11.20pm in South Beach.

When Dixon, 24, stopped and was informed of the violations, he became 'belligerent' and started to yell, according to a Miami Beach Police report.

New Orleans Saints cornerback Brian Dixon was charged with resisting arrest without violence to his person

The 24-year-old was arrested on Saturday night in Miami after police say he was operating his scooter unsafely

After he was stopped by cops, Dixon allegedly said: 'You're just doing this because I'm a black man with dreads'

He asked police if they were serious about ticketing him and claimed he was only making a U-turn, the Advocate reported. 

He then allegedly yelled: 'Just give me my ticket so I can get the f**k out of here.'

The officers ordered Dixon to sit on the curb because of his 'imposing size, stature, and weight, as well as the defendant's agitated state'. 

Police said he refused and then took a 'bladed' or fighting stance toward a female officer, according to the Times-Picayune. 

After police had trouble taking him into custody, Dixon was placed under arrest with the assistance of ''several other spring break units'.

Before that happened, Dixon allegedly said: 'Let me go. 

'You're just doing this because I'm a black man with dreads and I look like a criminal. 

'I'm not a criminal.'

He added: 'I give so much to this community. 

'I'm an NFL player. Let me call my agent.'
