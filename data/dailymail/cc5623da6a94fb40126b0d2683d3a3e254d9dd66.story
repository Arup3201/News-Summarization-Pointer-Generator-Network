The 60th anniversary of the first ascent of the
world’s tallest peak has been commemorated with another record: the highest
leap ever taken off a mountain.

To celebrate the first time anyone ever successfully made it
to the top of Mount Everest, Russian daredevil Valery Rozov, 48, donned a
special wingsuit and dove off the north side of Everest on May 5.

His successful, albeit death defying, leap became the
highest BASE jump in history at 23,687 feet above sea level.

Record breaking: Valery Rozov had years of experience and 10,000 BASE jumps behind him, but his May leap at Mount Everest broke the record at 7,220 meters above sea level

His BASE jump, which stands for ‘buildings, antennas, spans,
and earth’ allowed him to glide through the air for a full minute with his specialized
suit at speeds as high as 125 miles per hour.

The jump took him from Everest’s north peak on the Chinese
side to Rongbuk glacier on the Tibetan side.

It took the veteran jumper, whose made 10,000 jumps in his
career, four days to reach the cliff off of which he made his record jump,
according to an announcement on jump sponsor Red Bull’s website. A team of four
Sherpas helped him along the way.

Fancy equipment: To perform the highest BASE jump in history, Rozov trained for two years and constructed a special winged suit 

Rozov spent around two years planning for the stunt, using
much of his prep time developing the customized wingsuit.

And Rozov has cheated death before. In 2009, the Russian
leaped into an active volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula in his country’s Far
East.

Free falling: After flying free for nearly a minute at speeds up to 125mph, the Russian daredevil landed with a parachute on the Ronbuk glacier at an altitude of 5950 meters

Preparation: Rozov planned the jump for two years and designed a special wingsuit to help him meet the record-breaking challenge

In 2010, he would leap from Ulvetanna, a 1.24 mile high peak
in Antarctica. That led him to jump from Shivling, an over 21,000 foot mountain
in the Himalayas that has been described as Rozov’s precursor to the Everest
jump.

Despite Rozov’s expertise, even he was shocked at his feat
in retrospect.

‘Only when I got back home did I see how hard it was for me
both physically and psychologically,’ he said.

Free fall: Rozov flew for a full minute as he broke the BASE jump record. He landed safely at the Tibet side of Everest, having started on the China side
