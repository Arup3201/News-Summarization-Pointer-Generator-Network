G20 leaders will pressure Eurozone countries to develop a comprehensive and lasting strategy for tackling the ongoing economic crisis following Greece's narrow decision to stay in the single currency.

The group of 20 leaders from the world's major economies, which represent more than 80 per cent of global output, today start a two-day summit in the Mexican resort of Los Cabos.

President Obama arrived for the conference yesterday while Germany's Chancellor Merkel and French President Francois Hollande delayed their flight to await the result of the Greece election, amid fears that the vote could lead to a Greek exit.

Chancellor Merkel is expected to defend her view that a mix of fiscal tightening and reforms was the only way to overcome the crisis and to return to sustainable growth.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is expected to highlight the need to tackle debts and regulate the banking system, is scheduled to arrive later today.

Delegates are expected to prioritise growth and job creation as the path to bolstering a world economy that is running out of steam - but Europe's progress toward a lasting solutions for its debt crisis will be the focal point.

The meeting is also expected to call for an increase in contributions to the International Monetary Fund.

Mexico's president Felipe Calderon, 
who is hosting the summit said: 'I estimate that there will be a larger 
capitalisation than the pre–accord reached in Washington, which will be 
finalised here, but I don't want to speculate by how much.'

While
the Greek vote has eased immediate uncertainty over a possible euro 
zone breakup, the relief in financial markets could quickly evaporate.

G20 countries want to hear whether 
Europe is moving toward adopting a firm roadmap with a timetable for 
achieving the huge leap of financial, fiscal and political union in 
order to strengthen the resiliency of monetary union -- a path that EU 
leaders as yet have been unready to take ahead of their summit at the 
end of June.

'We're going to continue to make the case,' said David Plouffe, a senior Obama adviser said in a television interview.

'There will be progress made over the next couple days, but no one should expect a firm resolution,' he said.

Chinese
President Hu Jintao in a newspaper interview over the weekend said G20 
members should address the debt crisis in a 'constructive and 
cooperative way, encourage and support efforts made by Europe to resolve
it and send a signal of confidence to the market'.

Japan too backed that call.

'We
(Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan and I) agreed to seek further efforts
from eurozone, Germany in particular, as stability in Europe is 
indispensable,' Finance Minister Jun Azumi said as he arrived in Mexico 
for the G20 summit.

President
Obama will press Vladimir Putin over Russia's role in the Syrian crisis,
however Moscow's resistance to tougher UN action  
looks set to continue.

The first meeting between the two leaders since 2009 will test 
whether they can forge a working relationship and find common
ground on Syria and other festering disputes.

Suspension of the UN monitoring 
mission in Syria over the weekend has added pressure  to act decisively to keep the conflict from spiraling into 
civil war.

Diplomatic efforts will be further 
complicated by Obama's re-election battle against Republican Mitt Romney
- who has called Russia 'our number one geopolitical foe' - as well as 
questions on Putin's anti-Western 
rhetoric.

With Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
continuing his bloody, 15-month crackdown on the opposition, Obama and 
Western allies want veto-wielding Moscow to stop shielding him from 
further U.N. Security Council sanctions aimed at forcing him from power.

Russia is reluctant to abandon
Syrian, a longtime arms customer, and risk losing its last firm 
foothold in the Middle East, including access to a warm-water navy base.

Last week Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused Russia of supplying Assad with attack helicopters which drew an angry retort from the Kremlin.

World Bank President Robert Zoellick 
was far more forceful, calling it 'an absolutely critical time' and 
warning Europe not to squander this opportunity for decisive action.

'We are waiting for Europe to tell us what it is going to do,' said World Bank President Robert Zoellick.

'The
danger we're creating is the danger of policymaking that is increasing 
uncertainty and making markets more nervous, which has a negative 
feedback loop,' he said on Sunday at a business meeting on the sidelines
of the G20 summit.

Europe's
debt crisis has underscored the need for a bigger war chest at the 
International Monetary Fund.

Leaders are set to confirm they will double
the IMF's firepower with an extra $430 billion in loans even though 
some emerging nations are frustrated with the slow pace of winning more 
power at the global lender.

The G20 leaders are expected to adopt a
Los Cabos Action Plan, pledging to promote economic growth and jobs, 
investing in infrastructure and promoting trade, while sticking to its 
pledges to bring down budget deficits,.

In
a hint of flexibility on its austerity push, Germany indicated a 
readiness to give Athens more time to implement the tough economic 
reforms required under its €130 billion European Union/IMF bailout.

These terms were the central battleground issue in the Greek election campaign.

German
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle left no doubt that Greece must stick
to the terms of the bailout if it wants to stay in the euro currency, 
but he added: 'I can imagine that we would talk about the time axes once
again.'

This would be welcome to the United 
States and other G20 countries, which have warned that cutting spending 
too quickly can set off a vicious cycle of recession, escalating 
deficits, social and political upheaval and spreading global risk.

Softening the EU's austerity drive 
also is a priority for new Socialist French President Francois Hollande,
whose hand was strengthened on Sunday by a resounding leftist victory 
in parliamentary elections.

Even
if the timetable is eased, Greece will still have to make budget 
cutbacks that so far have plunged the country into recession and pushed 
unemployment over 20 percent.

It must first form a government, which 
should happen in coming days, before the EU or the IMF would have 
discussions

European leaders and the IMF said they would work with Greece to restore the country to growth.

Business leaders from more than 400 companies meeting on the sidelines at Los Cabos urged the G20 to deliver results.

'Over the next few days we will see whether the world can come together or come apart,' said World Economic Forum Managing Director Robert Greenhill.
