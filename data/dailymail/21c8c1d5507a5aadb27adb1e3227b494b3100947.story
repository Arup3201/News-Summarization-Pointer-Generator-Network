Parents of an 8-week-old baby were arrested  after their son died Thursday evening from injuries sustained from being shaken. 

Police in Seminole County responded to a child abuse report on July 11 at the loft where 26-year-old Joshua Stuart was taking care of his newborn son Eli Heath.

Apparently Stuart started shaking the baby when Eli wouldn't stop crying after being fed a bottle.

By the time police arrived at the family's warehouse loft near Longwood, Eli was limp, bleeding from the nose and not breathing.

Eli was rushed to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children where doctors found fractures on the baby's body and injuries consistent with being shaken.

Doctors were not optimistic that the child would survive, and on Thursday the baby succumbed to his injuries.

Since the shaking incident, both of Eli's parents have been arrested for child abuse.

Stuart originally ran away from police when they discovered the child, but he was later apprehended at Altamonte Springs.

Stuart was arrested for aggravated child abuse, but police tagged on a homicide charge Friday after the baby's death.

The boy's mother, 24-year-old Jessica Heath, has also been arrested on charges of child neglect with great bodily harm.

Heath wasn't at the warehouse at the time of the incident, but was responsible for the baby's fussiness.

She was supposed to give Eli medicine to treat a medical condition that required a strict regimen.

As of Friday, both parents were still in custody.
