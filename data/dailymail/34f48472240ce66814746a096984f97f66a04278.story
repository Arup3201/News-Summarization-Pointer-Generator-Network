A series of earthquakes and trembles that have struck in the Atlantic Ocean in the past week suggest that an underwater volcano is about to blow.

The largest of these quakes reached a magnitude of 5.1 off the coast of El Hierro - the smallest island in the Canaries - and the island is said to have swelled by three inches.

If the volcano was to erupt, the force could push masses of molten rock to the surface and could subsequently create a new island or islet in the Canary chain.

A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit El Hierro in the Canary Islands on Friday suggesting a nearby underwater volcano could soon erupt. This could force rock to emerge from the sea, creating a new island. In 2011, the southern tip of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake and magma appeared off the coast, pictured

It would also mean all 10,000 residents on the 107 square mile stretch of land would need to be evacuated.

El Hierro itself was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high.

According to Involcan, the Volcanological Institute of the Canaries, over 550 earthquakes were reported and monitored between Monday and Christmas Day on Wednesday.

Some 30 of these were said to have been a 3-magnitude quake or higher.

The majority of these quakes, as well as the swelling on El Hierro, were centred on the region of La Restinga on the south coast of the island.

The 5.1-magnitude quake was the strongest ever recorded in the region and its epicenter was said to be around nine miles deep.

In October 2011, El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake as an underwater volcano started spewing matter 60ft into the air, pictured. The island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake

In November this year, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean created a new island off the coast of Japan, pictured. The mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed Ring of Fire - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of Tokyo

In October 2011, the same region of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake as an underwater volcano just off the coast started spewing matter 60ft into the air.

The island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake.

Vast quantities of magma also began bubbling into the sea off the port of La Restinga resulting in its 600 residents being evacuated.

Under the Canary Islands lies an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the African Plate - on which the islands sit - shifts.

Most of the islands are still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller, previously undetected fault line also runs through the chain.

El Hierro was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high.

Volcanic activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused El Hierro to expand continually. The last time it erupted was in 1793.

Some 50,000 years ago, massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a large part of the island to crack off and fall into the Atlantic Ocean, according to Irish Weather Online.

That created the El Golfo valley on the island and caused an 300ft-high tsunami that probably reached the American coast.

This feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on La Palma - the most tectonically active of the Canary Islands - could trigger a mega-tsunami.

The theory - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line through the island would cause a major landslide under certain circumstances.

That landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage all down the Atlantic Coast of the U.S., the Caribbean, Western Europe, West Africa and the east coast of South America.

By December the same year, the eruption was said to be subsiding because the number of tremors and earthquakes decreased.

This increased again in January 2012, but by March the authorities on El Hierro declared the eruption threat to be over.

Following the swarm of quakes early last week, El Hierro’s monitoring agency raised the volcanic eruption risk to ‘yellow’.

Following the rise in seismic activity in 2011, dark brown magma was spotted off the coast of El Hierro, pictured left, near the town of La Restinga. La Restinga was evacuated and shipping in the area was banned but the activity subsided by March 2012. Right, a closer image of the magma in the water

The most recent previous ‘yellow’ alert was released in June 2012, but the volcano failed to erupt then as well.

In November this year, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean created a new island off the coast of Japan.

The
 mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed Ring of Fire - a hub of seismic activity situated 
620 miles south of Tokyo.

When it first emerged, the new island was 
600ft in diameter and appeared next to a small, uninhabited island in 
the Pacific called Nishinoshima.

Further eruptions last week, however, have caused the new island to move and join Nishinoshima. 

The last eruption on El Hierro was in 
1793 and lasted for a month. The last eruption in the Canary Islands as a
 whole took place on the island of La Palma in 1971.
