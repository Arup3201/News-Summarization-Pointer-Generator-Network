Mark Berndt, 62, a former teacher, has agreed to plead no contest to all charges after her was found feeding cookies laced with his semen to pupils

A former Los Angeles elementary school teacher charged with blindfolding students and spoon-feeding them cookies laced with his semen has agreed to plead no contest to all charges, an attorney for some of the victims said Thursday.

Mark Berndt plans to enter the legal equivalent of guilty pleas to 23 charges at a hearing Friday, according to John Manly, an attorney who represents 30 Miramonte Elementary School students and their parents. Manly said he was notified of the plea by prosecutors.

The plea agreement calls for Berndt to be sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Manly called the agreement a victory for his clients and said they are grateful for being treated 'with decency and dignity' by prosecutors.

'He's going to jail essentially for the rest of his life,' he said of the 62-year-old Berndt. 'You can't ask for more than that.'

He said prosecutors urged a plea deal because 'they were concerned about re-traumatizing the children at trial.'

The district attorney's office and Berndt's lawyer declined to comment.

Before Berndt was sentenced, a parade of sobbing mothers denounced him, saying he had ruined their lives and the lives of their daughters. The women were not named in court.

They said they could not understand how the school district did not know about the incidents.

Some said their daughters could no longer eat cookies or anything sweet unless they knew their mothers had baked the items for them. They spoke of girls who had now become unable to socialize and locked themselves in their bedrooms.

Even though defense attorney Manny 
Medrano said his client was remorseful and apologetic, the 62-year-old 
man in an orange prison jumpsuit showed no emtional and stared straight 
ahead during the impact statements.Â 

Berndt
 taught at the south Los Angeles school for more than 30 years. The 
allegations against him came to light when a drugstore photo technician 
noticed dozens of odd photos of blindfolded third-graders and reported 
them to authorities.

Investigators said they discovered a plastic spoon in Berndt's classroom trash bin. Tests found traces of semen on it.

According to prosecutors, Berndt used the semen-coated cookies for "tasting games" with students. He was removed from the classroom in January 2011.

Berndt was fired and the Los Angeles Unified School District then paid him $40,000 to drop his appeal, which officials said was the most immediate way to ensure he wouldn't be a threat to other children. The move still brought heavy criticism.

Dozens of lawsuits and claims were filed on behalf of victims. Sean Rossall, a district spokesman, said 63 cases have been settled for a total of $29.5million, and 71 are pending.

He said the district has not seen the plea agreement and won't comment until it's approved by a judge.

'We're focused on the civil cases and 
settling them in a manner that is respectful of the health and 
educational needs of students and their families,' he said.

The
 Miramonte case led to a wide-ranging overhaul of how the nation's 
second-largest school district handles allegations of sexual abuse after
 it was revealed that previous complaints about Berndt's behavior were 
ignored.

It also showed
 how slowly state officials act to censure teachers and led to a flurry 
of allegations of teacher-student sex abuse in the district and in other
 school systems.

Shortly
 after Berndt's arrest, the school district temporarily removed all 76 
of the school's teachers, along with staff and administrators, putting 
them on leave and having them report to an empty high school nearby.

Six
 months later, when the new school year began, 43 of them returned to a 
restructured Miramonte with a new principal. The rest either retired or 
went to new schools. None was accused of any wrongdoing.

Manly denounced the district for allowing Berndt to continue teaching after there had been complaints about him in the 1990s.

'For all intents and purposes , this man murdered these children emotionally,' he said, noting all of the children are in therapy. He said some have developed severe eating disorders as a result of the abuse with cookies.

Another Miramonte teacher, Martin Springer, is charged with lewd acts on a child in a case involving a second-grader that authorities said was fondled in class in 2009. Springer is awaiting trial.
