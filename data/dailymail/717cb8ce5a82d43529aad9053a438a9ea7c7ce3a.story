Jimmy Savile's abuse victims have been instructed how to claim up to £60,000 in compensation in a newspaper advert published today.

About 140 people have told police they were attacked by the DJ in hospitals or on BBC premises before he died in October 2011, aged 84.

In February the High Court agreed a compensation scheme worth around £3million and victims will be able to make claims against Savile's estate, the BBC and the NHS.

But nobody will receive more than £60,000 and should apply for cash by the start of June.

Compensation: Jimmy Savile's abuse victims are being instructed how to claim up to £60,000 in compensation from his estate, the BBC and the NHS

The adverts appear in today's Times and Daily Mirror newspapers, as well as some local newspapers, and warn alleged victims they must apply for compensation in the next six weeks.

High Court judge Mr Justice Sales sanctioned the scheme after agreement between NatWest, the executor of Savile's estate, lawyers representing Savile's alleged victims, the NHS and the BBC.

He described the compensation scheme as a 'sensible and pragmatic' attempt at solving a 'complex situation', and also approved the publishing of the newspaper advertisements.

The adverts advise people who wish to make a claim for sexual assault by Savile to do so within the next six weeks, by June 3.

The claim scheme will be open for a year, within which it is hoped all claims will be paid, the adverts say.

Lawyers initially put the value of Savile's estate at around £4 million, but Mr Justice Sales said the current value was about £3.3 million.

Solicitors representing alleged victims have said that the scheme will not guarantee payouts but will provide a framework within which claims can be analysed.

Savile, who worked at the BBC, has been accused of being a serial child abuser and sex offender, and was alleged to have abused people in hospitals.

Lawyers have said they think the vast majority of alleged victims have already emerged.
