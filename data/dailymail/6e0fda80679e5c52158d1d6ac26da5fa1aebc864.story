Scathing: New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has blasted Bill de Blasio and Democratic mayoral hopefuls

New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has blasted Bill de Blasio and his fellow Democratic mayoral hopefuls for back-stabbing him over city's stop-and-frisk policy.

The veteran cop, who is approaching the end of his run as the city’s longest-serving police commissioner, said in a scathing interview that he felt betrayed.

Reporter Glenn Plaskin asked the commissioner, 'Do you think they were just full of s***?'

'Absolutely,' replied Kelly.

In
the interview published today in Playboy magazine Kelly said he had a close relationship 
with all of the Democratic candidates before they turned on him for 
political gain.

'It just goes to show you what some politicians will do,' he said, reported the New York Post.

'They’ll say or do anything to get 
elected. I know all these people. They all claimed to be friends of mine
until their mayoral campaigns.'

The
NYPD has come under scrutiny for its 'stop and frisk' policy, which 
several minority groups contend is an unlawful discriminatory practice.

Getting into the grove: Bill de Blasio celebrates his victory with a family smack down - a dance that has become his trademark through his campaign for New York City mayor

One of the planks of De Blasio's campaign was to promote the end of stop and frisk which he calls a violation of civil rights.

In one advert his 18-year-old son Dante made the case for his father's life and policies including stop and frisk.

The profiling practice has been vigorously defended by Kelly and New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.

And Kelly
said the city has thwarted 16 terror attacks, including ones on the 
subway system, the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square and JFK 
Airport.

He said he had the highest job-approval rating of any public official.

In the reflective interview the 72-year-old also spoke of meeting President George W. Bush, who asked if the commissioner noticed people giving Bush the middle finger.

Next at bat: De Blasio met with his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, on Wednesday morning in City Hall

'They’re just saying you’re Number 1, Mr. President,' Kelly replied.

Last week de 
Blasio met with Bloomberg as the two men 
started to discuss his transition into City Hall.

The
two men have never been particularly close and it showed through 
Bloomberg's expressions as he stayed straight-faced- and even pouted- 
during their meeting.

Bloomberg,
an Independent who had previously been aligned with both the Democratic
and Republican parties, chose to stay out of the race to replace him 
and never fully endorsed any of the candidates.

Many
assumed he would support Christine Quinn as the two were very close and
she was a front-runner in the Democratic field but de Blasio ended up 
gaining more traction by marketing himself as the 'anti-Bloomberg', 
criticizing the billionaire mayor for widening the income inequality gap
in New York and promoting police tactics like 'stop and frisk'.

De Blasio beat his Republican competitor in a landslide, winning 73 per cent of the vote compared to Joe Lhota's 24 per cent.

He will take office on January 1 as the first Democrat mayor in Gracie Mansion since 1989.

His poet wife Chirlaine McCray, who has previously written an article about her time as a lesbian before meeting Bill, is politically active and expected to play a major role in the administration.

Bloomberg,
who first ran as a Republican and later became an independent, guided 
the city through the financial meltdown and the aftermath of 9/11. He is
leaving office after three terms.
