It's been a brutal winter for many people across the East Coast of the United States with non-stop snow storms.

But now forecasters are warning that Southerners could get a new cold front heading across the country which could leave a bit of everything in its wake - including snow, flooding, ice and mudslides.

Temperatures will soon drop 20 degrees or more throughout the country, according to data from The National Weather Service.
