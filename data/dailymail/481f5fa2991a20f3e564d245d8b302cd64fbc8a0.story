Two men charged with detonating car bombs have been blindfolded and executed by rebel fighters in Syria.

The men, reportedly charged by an Islamic religious court over setting off the explosives in the Idlib province, were killed in nearby Binnish in front of crowds of onlookers.

Photos from the scene show the men kneeling on the ground as gun-toting rebels aim their rifles at them and discuss their fate.

The men are then lined up next to a wall and half-a-dozen rebels fire at them with pistols and rifles - one even appears to film the executions on his mobile phone.

The flurry of bullets stir up dust clouds which obscure their bloody bodies.

The executions come amid news that Jihadists have killed at least 50 Syrian soldiers in ambush attacks.

Meanwhile, Jordan's air force shot down an 'aerial target' near the Syrian border today - believed to have been a drone - a Jordanian military official said.Â 

It was not immediately clear where the object came from, but there have been reports of intense fighting in the southern Syrian province of Daraa that borders Jordan.

Syria's civil war, now in its fourth year, has often spilled across the country's borders.

Also, extremists from the Islamic State group last month seized a huge chunk of territory straddling the Iraq-Syria border, declared a self-styled caliphate and imposed their harsh interpretation of Islam on the civilian population in the area.

In Syria, members of the Islamic State fought government forces in different areas today, mostly in the country's north. Since their blitz offensive in Iraq in June, the Islamic State has increasingly taken on President Bashar Assad's forces in a push to seize as much of Syrian territory as possible.

The aerial target was followed by Jordan's air force and shot down at dawn over an empty area in the province of Mafraq, said the Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. 'The armed forces will not allow any infringement of the country's security,' he said.

According to eyewitnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing for their safety, the drone was shot down near the Zaatari camp in Jordan, which is home to more than 120,000 Syrian refugees who fled the conflict at home.

In April, Jordanian warplanes struck a convoy of vehicles as they were trying to enter Jordan from Syria. The Jordanian military said the aircraft destroyed the vehicles after firing warning shots.

Jordan hosts nearly 600,000 registered Syrian refugees - although Jordanian officials say the real number is far higher.

The kingdom has quietly supported Syria's rebels since the start of the uprising against Assad in 2011, and ordered Syria's ambassador out in May after accusing him of making "offensive" statements about Jordan.
