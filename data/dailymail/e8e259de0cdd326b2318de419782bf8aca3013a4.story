Spain's opposition conservatives swept commandingly into power last night as voters enduring a 21.5 per cent unemployment rate and stagnant economy spectacularly dumped the Socialist Party.

The Popular Party, led by Mariano Rajoy, won 186 seats in the 350-seats lower chamber of parliament compared to 
154 in the last legislature, while the Socialists plummeted from 169 to 110, 
their worst performance ever.

The PP won an absolute majority 
and resounding mandate from a deeply troubled electorate - it needed 176 
votes for such a cushion.

The election result marks the third time in as many weeks that the eurozone debt crisis has claimed a government.

As thousands of jubilant, cheering supporters waving red-and-yellow Spanish flags and blue-and-white party ones gathered outside Popular Party headquarters, their leader and future prime minister thanked Spaniards for their support.

But, in a sign of the current economic turmoil, Mr Rajoy then sounded a sombre note of warning.

He said: 'It is no secret to anyone that we are going to rule in the most delicate circumstances Spain has faced in 30 years.

'For me, there will be no enemies but unemployment, the deficit, excessive debt, economic stagnation and anything else that keeps our country in these critical circumstances.'

'There won't be any miracles,' he added. 'We never promised any. But as we have said before, when things are done properly, the results come in.'

Socialist party candidate 
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba conceded defeat. Prime Minister Jose Luis 
Rodriguez Zapatero, whose popularity plummeted as the crisis deepened 
and enacted austerity measures that doomed him among supporters, did not
 seek a third term in office, or speak publicly last night.

But Mr Perez Rubalcaba said his party
 would fight to protect the welfare state from social spending cuts that
 Mr Rajoy will almost certainly make to meet EU-mandated deficit 
reduction cuts his party has pledged to fulfil.

In the Senate, with 58 per cent of 
the votes counted, it was 134 for the PP and 50 for the Socialists. 
Another few dozens seats in that chamber are not elected directly.

One surprise outside the economic 
realm is that a new pro-independence Basque coalition called Amaiur won 
seven seats and now outnumbers the region's traditionally strongest 
party, the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, with five.

This comes about a month after the 
armed Basque separatist group ETA declared an end to its armed campaign,
 saying it would seek independence through strictly peaceful means.

The promised change in political direction failed to immediately lift 
financial markets, with Madrid's key Ibex index today down nearly 2 per cent 
in early trading.

Spain's key borrowing rate for ten-year bonds on the secondary market 
started a second week edging toward 6.5 per cent, close to levels where 
other eurozone countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to 
request huge bailouts from the EU and the International Monetary Fund.

A 7 per cent rate is considered unsustainable over the long term.

Other than promise tax cuts for small- and medium-size companies that make up more than 90 per cent of all firms in Spain, Mr Rajoy has not specified how he will tackle Spain's unemployment nightmare.

The 56-year-old faces the towering task of restoring investor confidence and lowering Spain's soaring borrowing costs with deficit-reducing measures, while not dragging an already moribund economy into a double-dip recession.

It only just climbed out of one last year that was prompted by the bursting of a housing market bubble.

Mr Rajoy said he has not promised miracles and there will be none, but that the PP has shown in the past - it ruled from 1996 to 2004 and got Spain into the euro along the way - it gets things done.

He appealed to Spaniards to join together and resurrect the economy.

Mr Rajoy, who has lost two previous elections, said: 'We stand before one of those crossroads that will determine the future of our country, not just in the next few years but for decades.'

The conservatives won roughly 45 per cent of the votes and the Socialists took 29 per cent, according to official election results. In the last elections in 2008, the latter won by about four points.

The PP won most seats in 45 of the
 country's 52 provinces. The result, together with a clean sweep in 
municipal and regional elections in May, left it in its strongest 
position ever. 

It also meant that unlike the 
outgoing Socialist government, the PP will not have to rely on support 
from any other political party to implement its policies.

Curiously, the PP only edged up from 
10.2million to 10.8million votes, while the Socialists' vote plummeted 
from 11.1million in 2008 to 6.9million. 

That was to the benefit of smaller 
parties such as the United Left, which saw its seat numbers shoot from 
two in 2008 to 11 this year.

The new numbers show Spanish voters have shifted decidedly to the right as they confront their worst economic crisis in decades and choose new leaders to pull them out of it.

As part of that mess, the country is also at the forefront of Europe's sovereign debt crisis, with the Spanish government's borrowing costs rising last week to levels near where other eurozone countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to request huge bailouts from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

Besides the recent changes in which Greece and Italy replaced their governments with teams made up of technocrats, Ireland and Portugal - which also required huge bailouts to avert default - also saw their governments change hands.
