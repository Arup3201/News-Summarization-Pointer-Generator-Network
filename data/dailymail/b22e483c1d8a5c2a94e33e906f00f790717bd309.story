Abandoned at a horse rescue centre three times by different owners, Annie the Welsh Cob wasn’t exactly having much luck.

But then she met a princess – and got herself a fairytale ending.

The princess in question was Princess Anne, who rehomed the 14-year-old horse after spotting her on an official visit to the World Horse Welfare charity in Somerset.

She had been considering buying a horse to hack around her Gloucestershire estate, Gatcombe Park.

Annie is now helping the princess herd sheep and hack around her 200 acres of woodland.

It marks a dramatic change in fortunes for 14-year-old Annie who came to the charity three years ago when her owners were no longer able to care for her.

'She's perfect for me,' said Princess Anne, president of Horse World Welfare.

'She's 14 and she's not wanting to be too ambitious and I don't want to be very ambitious either.

'She will be a really useful nanny - I have young stock.'

The princess added: 'She fits in really well and as far as I'm concerned I was really glad they didn't find someone else for her.

'She is just the size of horse that I could do with now.

'Living here and going across the farm I
like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was 
reasonably reliable when it come to rural activities.'

Princess Anne first met Annie during a tour of the charity's stables in Kingsdon, Somerset.

'She had a very good reputation and it seemed silly for me to go off and get something else,' she said.

'I hope Annie enjoys it here with me. We will be doing some hacking and she will be helping me herd the sheep and cattle.

'Rehoming from a charity may be the best way of finding a horse because you know so much more about the animal you are getting.'

The Horse World Welfare is now hoping this high-profile adopter will encourage others to help rehome the 7,000 horses currently being looked after by charities across the UK.

It has launched a rehoming campaign and warned that horses are being bred in large numbers in spite of a 'saturated' market, with horses being abandoned or sold for just a few pounds.

World Horse Welfare chief executive Roly Owers said: 'Our rescue and rehoming centres are full to bursting - and there are thousands more horses who need our help.

'Once again our president, HRH The Princess Royal, has shown outstanding support by rehoming Annie, especially now that Britain is in the midst of a horse crisis.

'By rehoming Annie, our president is making space for another horse to get their care it needs and we urge other members of the public who can to do the same before winter sets in.'
