Firefighters were presented with an unusual problem when they had to free a pensioner who had spent almost six hours trapped in a deckchair.

The 83-year-old became stuck whilst sunbathing on her balcony in Scarborough, North Yorks.

When the fabric ripped, her bottom became lodged in the deckchair and she was unable to free herself because her legs were up in the air.

She became stuck at 8am yesterday morning and spent the next few hours crying for help.

A fire crew were passing the pensioner's home when they heard her attempts to attract attention from the second-floor balcony.

They gained access to her home by climbing over her neighbourâ€™s property.

Firefighters eventually managed to free her from the deckchair at 1.50pm, nearly six hours after she had fallen through.

Recovery: The pensioner was taken to Scarborough District Hospital for further treatment as a precautionary measure

A North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: 'This was an unusual incident, but firefighters are trained for every eventuality.'

Paramedics from the Yorkshire Ambulance Service were also called just before 2pm and treated the pensioner at the scene.

She was then taken to Scarborough District Hospital for further treatment as a precautionary measure.
