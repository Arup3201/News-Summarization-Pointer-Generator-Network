Actor Stephen Collins could have molested at least one child as recently as 2007 according to the latest allegations made by his estranged wife.

Collins famously starred as the Reverend Eric Camden in the TV series 7th Heaven and according to Faye Grant, her husband used the celebrity that came with that role to gain the trust of two parents so he could sexually abuse their child.

The hit show ran from 1996 until 2007, which means that Collins may have molested children well after the crimes he has allegedly confessed to.

An audio recording from a 2012 couple's therapy session in which Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to three young girls emerged last week. According to Collins, none of those incidents had occurred after 1984.

The latest allegations are included in an email that Grant sent her husband last year which has been obtained by TMZ.

A source close to Collins has denied Grant's claims.

‘The notion that Stephen used his role on 7th Heaven for any improper purpose is completely false and just another example of Faye fabricating a story to gain an advantage in the divorce proceedings,’ the source told TMZ. 

The allegations made against Collins have already cost him roles on the hit drama Scandal and in the upcoming film Ted 2, along with his position on the Screen Actors Guild National Board. 

Attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan has already pointed the finger of blame at Collins' wife of 27 years, Faye Grant, claiming that she had been threatening to leak to the tapes confession for years.

Suspected extortion: The actor's attorney said Grant has tried to blackmail the 7th Heaven star in order to get a bigger share of their assets as part of a future divorce settlement

‘Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled,’ he told TMZ.

‘When these demands were rebuffed, Faye attempted - without success - to peddle the tape in numerous ways to numerous different people.

‘It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape - not surprisingly, on the eve of the trial in the divorce case where, again, she is seeking millions of dollars more than that to which she is legally entitled.’

Grant has denied releasing the tapes to the media, saying that the recordings were supposed to be part of a criminal case.

The estranged wife has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totaling $14 million, including more than $5 million in property, an art collection worth $40,000, her husband's vintage guitar valued at $100,000, and his $16,000 Rolex.

Grants indicated in the legal papers that she is entitled to half of the assets, but sources close to Collins believe she wants it all.

Bombshell claims: Collins, 67, was accused last week of molesting three teenage girls and expressing incestuous thoughts about his unborn child

It's all about the money: Sources closed to Collins said his wife is hoping to walk away from their marriage with all of the couple's assets worth $14million 

New York City police announced last week that they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s.

The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a then-14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972.

An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed.

Faye Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative.

Grant wrote in the November 2012 declaration in the couple's divorce case that she reported abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations

‘Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,’ Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November.

The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed to divorce Grant, who he married in 1985.

Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation.

Grant stated her husband has said two of the girls he molested were abused when they were between the ages of 10 and 14 years old.

She has also claimed that he had sexual thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant.

She said just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused.

'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because "you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ.

'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added.

A source close to Collins dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely untrue.'

In the divorce filings obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his fame to trick abused children.

'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls.

'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'
