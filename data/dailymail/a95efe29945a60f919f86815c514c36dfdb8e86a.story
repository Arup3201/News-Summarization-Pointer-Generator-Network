Best known for its abject cold, WW2 death camps, and occasional, tenuous sightings of the Yeti, Siberia is not the first place you might associate with glamour and fun.

But the Russian ski resort of Sheregesh, where temperatures can reach -40C, is doing its best to reinvent the notion that one doesn't go to Siberia for a good time.

Not only does the up-and-coming resort have 'the best snow in Russia', according to the World Snowboard Guide, it also boasts comparatively balmy weather which has led to a new sport: bikini snowboarding.

And not surprisingly, it has proved a hit both with women keen to tan while they ski, and men happy to watch them doing it.

As these pictures show, the snow in Sheregesh is so good that it lasts from November until May, when the warmer Spring sun encourages skiboarders to strip off.

And it's not just the young women: plenty of men have taken advantage of the sunnier conditions to strip off and ski bare-chested.

Whether they are as appealing to the opposite sex as the bikini-clad girls, remains to be seen.

The World Snowboard Guide says that despite Sheregesh's 'famous Siberian frost, lack of apres-ski', and tedious eight-hour trek from Moscow, the powder is 'dry and fast' and its reputation as a relaxed and fun ski resort means it is fast becoming a fashionable place for Russia's jeunesse doree to go.

Another attraction of the resort is the forthcoming Yeti Park, based on the mythical 'abominable snowman' that some claim to have spotted in the Russian mountains.

Two years ago, a conference on 
bigfoot-type creatures, also known as Sasquatch, was held at Tashtagol, 
down the road from Sheregesh, attracting experts from around the world.

Frostbite is the freezing of the skin and other body tissues when exposed to the cold.  The first signs of frostbite are whitening of the skin and numbness, and the skin then beings to feel waxy and firm.

Sunburn can be a big problem in ski resorts as the sun's rays reflect off the snow.  In the absence of protective clothing, wear a good quality sun block and reapply frequently.

Hypothermia occurs when your core body temperature dips below 35C.  Shivering and disorientation are classic symptoms of this and sufferers may become so confused they try to take their clothes off which makes the problem worse..

Delegates heard how 
evidence had been collected in the mountains nearby that pointed to a 
'95 per cent certainty' of Yeti habitation in Mountain Shoria, and local
 residents said they had seen a bigfoot-type being in the Azasskaya 
cave.

A 60-bedroom hotel complex and amusement park based on the creature will offer families packages of skiing and yeti-hunting.

There will also be a museum devoted to the mythical creature in the Yeti Park, which is expected to take three years to build.

Igor Idimeshev, 48, deputy head of Sheregesh's local council, said: 'We are building the Yeti Park now, and of course there will be a chance for people who come here to see the creature.'

In the meantime, the less-hairy and rather more attractive snowboarders of Sheregesh are likely to be the main crowd-pullers.

One for the girls: Male snowboarders also go without their shirts, but they don't have quite the same glamour
