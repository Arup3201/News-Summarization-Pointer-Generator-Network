A schoolgirl has died after a car and a coach crashed.

The girl, who has not yet been identified but is thought to have been a teenager, was fatally injured at around 8.17am when the Renault Clio she was travelling in was involved in the collision.

West Midlands Police said officers were immediately sent to the scene at Valley Road in Bloxwich but despite the best efforts of the emergency services, nothing could be done to save the girl.

She was travelling in the Clio with a woman and a boy, who is also believed to be a teenager.

Crash: Emergency services were at the scene in Bloxwich, West Midlands

Scene: The crash took place this morning. Children riding in the coach were said to be shocked but not hurt

Both the woman and the boy were taken
 to hospital in a serious condition. Their injuries are described as 
potentially life-threatening.

A police spokesman said children from Shelfield Community Academy in Pelsall who were on the coach at the time of the collision were badly shocked but physically unharmed. They were taken to school on another bus and are being given support by the school and their families.

Inspector Paul Bennett is leading the investigation into the incident.

He said: 'This was a serious collision which has resulted in the tragic death of a young girl and badly injured a woman and another child.

'We're working hard to understand what led to the collision and I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time and who has not yet spoken to us to contact my officers as a matter of urgency.

'Our thoughts remain with all of those affected by the incident.'

Police said no arrests have been made but said a 'major investigation' had been launched following the crash.

Damage: The girl, thought to be in her teens, was in the passenger seat

Three ambulances, a paramedic area 
support officer in a rapid response vehicle and the Midlands Air 
Ambulance from Cosford were dispatched to the crash.

A
 spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said the male coach 
driver was assessed by paramedics but discharged at the scene.

They added: 'On arrival at the scene crews found a car and a coach that had been in collision.

'The
 driver of the car, a woman, was treated for serious multiple injuries. 
Due to the nature of her injuries, the doctor from the air ambulance 
gave the woman an anaesthetic at the scene before she was airlifted to 
the major trauma centre at University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

'The
 front seat passenger, a teenage boy, was treated for pelvic injuries 
and was taken to the same hospital, via land ambulance, for further 
assessment and treatment.

'The
 rear seat passenger, a girl, was assessed by ambulance crews at the 
scene but unfortunately it quickly became apparent that nothing could be
 done to save her and she was sadly confirmed deceased at the scene.

'The driver of the coach, a man, was assessed and discharged by ambulance crews at the scene.'

Coach operator Adams Tours is a local business based nearby.

A spokesman for coach industry body CPT said: 'All I can really confirm is that the coach was on a school 
run to the Shelfield Academy.

'It had only done one pickup so there were only six students on board. We know the vehicle was involved in a collision with a smaller car.

'As far as we are concerned from Adams Tours the driver, although shaken, is helping the police with their enquiries.'

'We
 are waiting for police and investigation reports but as far as we are 
concerned there are no question marks over the driver and that is not a 
line of enquiry.
