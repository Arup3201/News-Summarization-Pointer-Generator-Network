Winning an Emmy can add nearly three years to a actor's life thanks to the opportunities it gives them to improve their careers, a new study claims.

However the stress of being U.S. president, on the other hand, shortens the lives of those who wriggle so far up the greasy pole of politics by as many as five years.

Researchers from Columbia University, New York, investigated life's winners and losers to see how success could be linked to mortality.

Studies have long linked high socio-economic status with better health, but what has remained unclear is whether this is more to do with access to resources or the glow of higher social status relative to others.

Scholars call the latter 'relative deprivation.'

A team led by Dr Bruce Link studied Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, Emmy Award winners, and former Presidents and Vice Presidents, comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition or election.

They found no consistent advantages for winners. Indeed, in some cases such as winning the presidential election, the victory robbed the winner of several years.

Dr Link and his associates found the following effects of winning versus losing in the three groups:

'The relative deprivation theory would predict that losers would consistently be at a disadvantage for health and longevity compared to winners, but this is not what we see,' said Dr Link, a professor of Sociomedical Sciences.

A more likely explanation, he notes, is that the advantages and disadvantages of winning depend on the mix of opportunities and stresses that they bring.

Winning an Emmy often leads to significant career opportunities that might not have been otherwise available. The paper quotes actor John Larroquette saying, 'There's no doubt that having an Emmy precedes you through the door.'

On the other hand, Baseball Hall of Fame induction occurs after playing careers are over and therefore has little bearing on career opportunities and earnings.

As for presidential and vice presidential candidates, life circumstances do change for members of this elite club, but winning also brings significant risks: assassination threats and extreme stress from two of the world's most demanding jobs.

The 15 men who led the U.S. during the 20th century but died by the year 2008 lived an average of 1.9 years less than the average American male of the same age.

'Our findings provide an important correction to an overemphasis on relative deprivation as an explanation of health inequalities,' said Dr Link.

'Relative deprivation likely plays some role in health inequalities, but it is not as important as the life circumstances and opportunities that result from one's socioeconomic position.'

Findings are published online in the American Sociological Review and will appear in the April 2013 print edition.

However, being President comes with stress that takes a toll

@highlight

Emmy-winning actors enjoyed 2.7 more years of life than nominees who did not snag the trophy. Though Emmy-winning screenwriters were, mysteriously, at a three-year disadvantage.

@highlight

Baseball Hall-of-Famers enjoyed no advantage in longevity over non-inducted nominees.

Presidents and Vice Presidents lose, on average, 5.3 years from their lives compared to the candidates they bested. While some of this is due to the impact of assassination, the disadvantage persists even when assassination is taken out of the equation.
