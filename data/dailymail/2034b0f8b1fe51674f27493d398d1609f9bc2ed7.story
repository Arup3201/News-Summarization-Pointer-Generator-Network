Two drivers travelling along a Victorian highway have narrowly escaped being crushed by seven trees during a wild storm.

Posted under YouTube name Ron Cooper, the dash camera footage shows the moment he had to hit the brakes just inches away from where the first tree falls in front of his vehicle.

The driver was travelling on the Black Spur highway between the towns of Healesville and Narbethong - north-east of Melbourne, which spans for about 30 kilometres, on December 29 about 2.15pm.

The incident happened on December 29 about 2.15pm when the first tree fell down, which was about 30 metres tall

The initial tree fall is followed by six others, stopping an oncoming car in its tracks who is also surprised by the sudden road blocks.

The uploader told the Herald Sun the gum tree was about 30 metres tall and was glad he made the decision to stop his vehicle rather than to speed up when he noticed the tree falling. 

'These trees started falling like a deck of cards,' he said.

'One more second - in fact even part of a second - would have put me either under the tree or into the tree.

About six more trees fell down after the initial one, stopping an oncoming car in its tracks

Wind speeds in the area the driver was travelling in got up to more than 80 km/h on December 29, according Bureau of Meteorology

'I'm always aware of what’s around me and I think it paid off that day.'

In the lead up to the video, leaves and branches can been seen falling in the vehicle's way as the driver makes his way along the road at Watts River Bridge.

He said he wanted to upload the video to YouTube to teach people about the dangers of driving during wild weather.

'One tree coming down is one thing but when you have like a dozen it's unheard of I think in one small area,' the driver said.

'I just want people worldwide - not just in Australia - to be aware of trees.'

On the video, the driver added the video served as 'a great educational video showing the dangers of traveling in the bush during periods of high wind'.

Wind speeds in the area the driver was travelling in got up to more than 80 km/h on December 29, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.
