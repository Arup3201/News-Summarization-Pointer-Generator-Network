The top three spots are in fact all located in the Northeast: Portland, Maine; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Burlington, Vermont, respectively.

In order to reach these findings, the study considered the percentage of households that own coffeemakers and buy coffee, the average amount of money spent on coffee per household, the number of cafes per capita and the percentage of residents who drink five-plus cups a day.
