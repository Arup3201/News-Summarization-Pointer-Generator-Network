Town centres face a summer of booze-fuelled violence if David Cameron’s plans to relax drinking rules during the World Cup go ahead, police and town halls are warning.

The Prime Minister is set to approve rules allowing every single one of the country’s 120,000 pubs and bars to open late on the evenings of England’s matches in Brazil this summer. Drinking hours would be extended as late as 1am for at least the three group matches in June.

But the proposals, published last week, have caused disquiet among police, councils and residents groups who will be left powerless to stop late opening even in pubs with a history of violence.

Last night, council chiefs told the Daily Mail the move would lead to ‘significant disturbance’ on the streets with local authorities left to ‘clear up the consequences’.

Until last month, the Home Office was set to allow controls on extended opening to rest with town halls. But this was set aside after a personal intervention from the Prime Minister.

Mr Cameron wants to invoke a little-used power available for ‘significant national events’ to allow a blanket extension of opening hours across the country.

The power was used for the Royal Wedding 2011 and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 but has never before been used for a major sporting tournament.

Downing Street’s intervention has caused disquiet in the Home Office, where there are fears it could unleash a wave of street violence.

Last night, the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said the issue of which pubs can open late should be ‘determined locally’.

A spokesman said: ‘Councils will always seek to say yes to well-run businesses who have proven that they can cater effectively for selling alcohol at events where emotions run high.

‘They also, however, have a responsibility to residents who live near popular venues and may be exposed to significant disturbance as a result.

‘Local councils and partners such as the police are best placed to consider these issues and reach decisions on how long local premises should stay open, whereas a blanket national extension fails to take local circumstances into account at all.’

Official Home Office documents point out that using the power during the World Cup could lead to ‘alcohol-related crime and disorder, public nuisance and risks to public safety.’

The alternative, which is backed by councils, would be for pubs and bars which wanted to stay open until late to apply for a temporary licence in the normal way.

This would give residents their say and allow councils to keep control of late-night drinking in town and city centres.

Police point to sharp increases in violence and arrests during major football tournaments. In 2012 more than 152 arrests were made during the opening games of the tournament, with most on England match days.

Tony Hogg, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall said: ‘I believe these decisions should be left in local hands, where local factors can be taken into account and suitable measures put in place in liaison with experienced local advice.

‘This is not about stopping people having fun and enjoying the football. We want to make sure that we promote a safe environment into the early hours of the morning, not just for those in the pubs but for the rest of the community as well.’

Cllr Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, said: ‘Everyone will enjoy a drink during the World Cup and big screen viewing in pubs is clearly going to be a big draw.

‘But that shouldn’t be a licence for known problem pubs that routinely give the police and councils issues to stay open simply by wrapping themselves in the St George flag.

‘Councils and the police should have the determining voice on what stays open locally as we have the local knowledge.

‘The era of extended licensing has in many cases proven to be more wild west saloon than the continental café society that proponents claimed. And, as ever, local authorities are left to clear up the consequences.’

Alcohol campaigners suggested the PM had caved to ‘alcohol industry pressure’.

Tom Smith, Policy Manager at Alcohol Concern said: ‘The Government once again seem poised to cave into alcohol industry pressure and rather than letting local areas decide on whether to extend pub opening hours for the World Cup, are intent on forcing this through from on high.

‘We think this should be up to local councils with residents who know their areas and where any potential trouble might arise.

‘The pressure from advertising during football World Cups to drink alcohol can be immense but we’d like to directly challenge the notion that watching football has to go hand in hand with drinking. Sport should be a celebration of fitness and health which is not compatible with excessive drinking.’

‘Rather than act as the nation’s landlord in setting pub hours, we’d like the Prime Minister to show leadership on alcohol policy and to start by listening to the views of local residents, police, A&E staff rather than big business.’

Under the original Home Office plans councils any pub or bar could apply to their local authority for longer opening hours.

But at the beginning of last month, Mr Cameron overruled Liberal Democrat Crime Minister Norman Baker and said he had ‘ordered a re-think’.

It followed lobbying by the British Beer and Pub Association which argued for longer opening hours across the board.

If the PM’s proposal is implemented it will mean all pubs can remain open until 1am for all three group games, against Italy at 11pm on June 14, Uruguay at 8pm on June 19 and Costa Rica at 5pm on June 24 - and any knockout stage matches.

All knock-out stage games kick-off at 9pm apart from the final, which will be played at 8pm on July 13 in Rio de Janeiro.

Mr Cameron’s intervention was welcomed by the British Beer and Pub Association. Its chief executive Brigid Simmonds said at the time it would be ‘fantastic news’ for millions of football fans.

At the time the Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘It is right that we consult but, subject to that consultation, clearly our intention would be that pubs would be able to be open for the relevant games, reflecting the fact that it is a major national event.’
