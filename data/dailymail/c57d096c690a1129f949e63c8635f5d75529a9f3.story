A greedy landlord who looted £32,000 while running a posh pub had another double life - a business and a huge villa in Spain.

Stephen Sussams, 59, stole £17,000 from his dead boyfriend’s bank account and conned nearly £15,000 in housing and council tax benefit.

But at the same time he was driving a Bentley and running the Royal Dart Hotel in Kingswear, Devon - which sold 'The Most Expensive Burger In The World'.

Benefit fraudster: Stephen Sussams looted £32,000 while running a gastropub in Devon and a bar in Spain

Sussams was jailed in December last year - despite claiming he was too fat for prison.

But a TV crew who filmed Croydon Council’s pursuit of the conman discovered not only did he live a double life in the UK - he also had a secluded hill-top villa in southern Spain.

The fraudster bought the stunning villa - since seized by a Spanish bank - and ran another bar business in the tourist spot while claiming incapacity benefits back in the UK.

Andrea Cordery, an investigator at Croydon Council, said: 'This is not just a lone parent doing an extra cleaning job to feed her starving children, or his starving children, this has been quite deceitful to say the least.'

Sussams looked after disabled civil partner Keith Dickinson but failed to tell the local authority when he died at the age of 72 in 2008.

The council continued paying care benefits into Mr Dickinson’s bank and Sussams carried on taking the money - withdrawing £4,000 the day after his death.

He then helped himself to four more sums of between £3,000 and £4,000 before Croydon Council halted the payments in January 2009.

At the same time Sussams’ pub in Kingswear, Devon, was boasting an £125 burger made from champagne-marinated Japanese Wagyu beef and seasoned with fresh black truffle.

At the same time he took over the tenancy of the deceased's flat and fraudulently claimed housing and council tax benefit until September 2011.

Council investigator Mrs Cordery, who worked for two-and-a-half years to catch the conman, added: 'The account was not closed and it kept on running, so the council kept on paying for care for a dead man.

'We needed to get that money back so we wrote to him in 2009 asking him to give us a refund of this money. He did not want responsibility for that.

'That led to us having to have a closer look at his affairs and then it just opened up a whole can of worms for him.'

At his trial, his lawyer said Sussams should be spared jail because he was struggling with obesity-related illness, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension.

But a judge dismissed the plea and threw him behind bars for eight months, after a jury found him guilty of four counts of benefit fraud and one count of theft, in December last year.

The full extent of Sussams’ scam will be shown on BBC One’s Panorama tomorrow night.

They filmed him leafing through wads of cash at the 
waterfront pub, found a bar he used to lease in Spain, and the villa.

In a bizarre twist, Sussams agreed to give the crew a face-to-face interview, in which he continued to dodge blame.

He told presenter Richard Bilton: 'I don’t think I did anything, or knowingly did anything wrong.

'It makes you sound like a grave robber but I’ll quite happily show you the will - I was the sole beneficiary. He was my soul mate and we had so many good times and so much fun over so many years.

'I
can see no real reason why that money shouldn’t have been withdrawn, 
and the fact it was withdrawn after his death, well let me tell you from
the moment he died, the bills started coming in.'
