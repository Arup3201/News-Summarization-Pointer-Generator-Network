An aerobatics pilot was lucky to walk away after his plane crash landed in the sea in Guatemala.

Captured by onlookers, this shocking footage shows the moments before the incident as the biplane attempted to complete a loop-the-loop - but failed mid-air. 

The accident took place close to the Marina del Sur area in Juan Gaviota on the country's west coast.

Mr Keller walked away from the accident with cuts and bruises, Guatemalan news agency Prensa Libre reported.

Things start well enough for Keller, with a smooth lift-off as the aircraft soars into the sky.

The deep throb of its engines fill the crowd with excitement and claps fill the air when it looks like the pilot is about to attempt a loop.

But disaster is just around the corner as he badly misjudges the timing.

Scary moment: Disaster is just around the corner and the plane comes plunging down, nose first

Although it seems as if the pilot is still in control of the biplane, as he brings it down low so that it’s almost skimming the surface of the water.

However there's no escape from the inevitable and the  plane comes plunging down, nose first.

The hum of the engine is abruptly cut off as the water floods the plane and gasps of horror are heard from the crowd. 

The pilot was reportedly performing stunts in the Stearman Model 75 biplane.
