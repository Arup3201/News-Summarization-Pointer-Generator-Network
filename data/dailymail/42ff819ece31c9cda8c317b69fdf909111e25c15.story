Barack Obama turned to divine intervention to help solve the problems of the US economy yesterday asking a Buddhist monk to pray for the success of upcoming talks with Congressional leaders over spending cuts.

The president was being given a tour of the Wat Pho monastery in Bangkok, Thailand, on the first stop of his Asia trip when he asked head monk Chaokun Suthee Thammanuwat for some extra help.

TV cameras picked up Hilary Clinton making a reference to budget negotiations back in Washington, where a series of potentially damaging tax increases and spending cuts loom.

meters long, and 15 meters high, stretches half the length of a football
field

TV cameras picked up the President tell his tour guide: 'We're working on this budget. We're going to need a lot of prayer for that'

'Yes,' Obama replied, turning to head monk Thammanuwa, 'We're working on this budget. We're going to need a lot of prayer for that.'

The President and Secretary of State Clinton enjoyed a private tour of the stunning temple - a popular tourist destination in Bangkok's Phra Nakhon district.

Observing traditional custom, they took off their shoes as the saffron-robed monk led them through the 18th century compound of multi-colored spires and chapels with its hundreds of gilded Buddha images.

The main attraction is the impressive reclining Buddha statue that at 46 meters long, and 15 meters high, stretches half the length of a football field. The statue is made of bricks and plaster and covered in gold leaf with mother-of-pearl inlay decorating the feet.

Mrs Clinton remarked about how peaceful 
it wasÂ  to which Mr Obama replied: 'If you have 80,000 people here it's 
not so peaceful. This is kind of a treat.'

At a news conference later, Obama said he was not joking about the need for prayer.

'I
always believe in prayers,' he said. 'I believe in prayer when I go to 
church back home, and If a Buddhist monk is wishing me well, I'll take 
whatever good vibes he can give me to try to deal with some challenges 
back home.'

Parts of the 
temple compound date to Thai King Rama I in the 1700s.

The king's ashes are kept 
beneath the pedestal of one of the huge seated Buddha statues in the 
complex, which is located along the banks of the Chao Phraya river near 
the Grand Palace. It is in the quiet, historic old quarter of Bangkok, 
outside the skyscraper-and-traffic clogged downtown.

'It's
meaningful that Obama came straight to Wat Pho,' said Pradab Supradit, a
67-year-old Thai grandmother who took a bus, a river ferry and then 
walked up roads closed for security hoping to glimpse the man or just 
see his convoy. 'It will bring him blessings because temples are at the 
center of Thai people's hearts.'

'I
want to see him with my own eyes," she said. "I like Obama because of 
his charisma and personality. He's a smart guy. I love the way he 
talks.'

Obama and Clinton also met with Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who turns 85 in December and has been staying at a hospital since 2009 because he is ill.

Obama entered a hospital meeting room with Clinton behind him. The king remained seated as Obama greeted him and grasped his hand.

'It's a great honor,' Obama said.

Obama said he brought greetings from 
the American people 'who are so grateful for the friendship of our two 
countries and are great admirers of yours - your wisdom and your 
leadership.'

The king responded in a soft tone.

Obama
smiled and said, 'Elections in the United States are very long, but 
it's very gratifying to know people still have confidence in me. I 
thought it was very important that my first trip after the elections was
to Thailand, which is such a great ally.'

During his visit, the king gave Obama a few gifts, including one for first lady Michelle Obama.

'She'll look very good in that color, Mr. President,' Clinton said. Reporters could not see the gift.

Obama
then picked up a photo album, which he said contained photos of all the
U.S. presidents and first ladies the king has met, starting with Dwight
Eisenhower and continuing through George W Bush.

'We left the last page blank' so a photo of Obama's visit could be added to the book, Obama said.

A framed lithograph was on an easel nearby depicting the Thai and U.S. flags. Obama said it was specially commissioned for the king, who is an art lover, "to symbolize friendship" between the two countries.

Later, Obama was asked during a news conference with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra what his favorite Thai food is. He replied that he likes it all and was pleased when he saw the menu for the state dinner.

'It looks very good,' said Obama, who had traveled about 19 hours from Washington, where it was early Sunday morning as the news conference took place. 'I'm also very hungry. I saved my appetite and I am looking forward to some authentic Thai food.
