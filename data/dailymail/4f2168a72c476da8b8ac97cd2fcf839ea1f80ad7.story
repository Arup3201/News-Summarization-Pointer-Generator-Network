Killer: Robert Hansen, pictured in an old mugshot, has passed away of natural causes aged 75

Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen, who admitted to killing 17 women and raping 30 more before he was portrayed by John Cusack in a movie about the slayings, has died of natural causes aged 75.

Hansen, a former Anchorage baker who earned the nickname 'the Butcher Baker' after abducting and hunting down women during the 1970s, passed away at 1.30am on Thursday at the Alaska Regional Hospital.

He was transferred to the hospital on Wednesday after being in declining health for the past year, Alaska Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sherrie Daigle said.

She added that it appeared as if he died of natural causes but the exact cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner.

Hansen was serving a 461-year sentence after being convicted in 1984 of murdering the women.

He confessed to killing 17 young women, mostly dancers and prostitutes, during a 12-year span but he was convicted of just four of the murders in a deal that spared him having to go to trial 17 times.

He also confessed to raping another 30 women in that time.

He had been incarcerated at the Seward state prison and was moved May 11, 2014, to the Anchorage Correctional Center to receive medical attention. 

In 2006, Hansen rejected a request to be interviewed by The Associated Press.

Caught: Hansen is pictured in 1983 after he was caught and admitted to killing at least 17 women and raping 30 others in Anchorage in the 1970s and early 1980s. He was a quiet baker and married with children

Creepy: Hansen, a licensed pilot and hunter, is pictured  with the horns from a record Dall sheep he killed before he was arrested. Sometimes he would let his victims go and then hunt them down with his rifle

'I do not care so much for myself, but you journalist (sic) have hurt my family so very much,' Hansen wrote in a typo-riddled, unsigned letter from Alaska's Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward. 

Hansen had owned a bakery in a downtown mini-mall in the 1970s and 1980s. He lived across town with his wife and children, who knew nothing of his other life.

Construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970s brought prostitutes, pimps, con artists and drug dealers to Alaska's largest city, all aiming to separate construction workers from some of the big money they were pulling in.

Many who looked for quick riches left as abruptly as they arrived in Anchorage, making sudden disappearances commonplace.

Killed: Among his victims, he killed Andrea Altiery (left) and kept her necklace as a trophy. Police also believe he murdered Megan Emerick (right), who was just 17 when she vanished in 1973

Victims: Sherry Morrow, 23, (left) was last seen in 1981 and shot while naked before she was dressed and buried in a shallow grave. Paula Goulding (right), a 17-year-old dancer, was killed in the same way

Glenn Flothe, a then-trooper who helped put Hansen behind bars, told the Anchorage Daily News in 2008 that Hansen's victims initially included any woman who caught his eye, but Hansen quickly learned that strippers and prostitutes were harder to track and less likely to be missed.

Hansen would abduct the women and take them to remote places outside the city. Sometimes, he would drive, and other times he would fly his private plane.

A licensed pilot, Hansen told investigators one of his favorite spots to take his victims was the Knik River northeast of Anchorage. Many of the bodies were found there in shallow graves.

Investigators have said that in some instances Hansen would rape the women but return them to Anchorage, warning them not to contact authorities.

Other times, he would let the women go free in the wilderness and then hunt them with his rifle.

In June 1983, one of his victims, Cindy Paulson, managed to escape his car as he loaded his plane to take her to his cabin.

He had already tortured and raped her, and she was still handcuffed when she ran from his car to flag down passing traffic.

She described the kidnapper and his plane to authorities, but when police questioned him, he had an alibi and a gentle demeanor, so they let him go.

But after some bodies were found by hunters in the area, investigators re-visited suspects and realized he fit the profile. His alibi - two friends - also admitted they had been lying.

They searched his plane, home and car and found he had some items, including jewelry, that had belonged to the women.

Only 12 bodies of the 17 women Hansen confessed to killing have been found. The others were never located.

Hansen became the subject of a 2013 film titled, 'The Frozen Ground,' which starred Nicolas Cage as an Alaska State Trooper investigating the slayings. Actor John Cusack portrayed Hansen.
