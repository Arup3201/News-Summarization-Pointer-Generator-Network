Angry Internet users are vowing to boycott a low-cost airline after it mocked the celebrity nude photo scandal in an attempt to sell tickets.

Florida-based Spirit Airlines is facing a backlash for its 'Our Bare Fare was hacked!' ad that features a drawing of a topless woman covering her breasts with her arms.

Twitter users have called the airline 'crude' and 'vile' for trying to take advantage of a photo hacking scandal that has exploited actress Jennifer Lawrence, model Kate Upton and other celebrity victims.

'This is vile': Spirit Airlines has been criticised for an ad that pokes fun at the celebrity nude photo scandal

Spirit Airlines emailed the ad to its newsletter list and posted the image on Twitter, but it deleted the tweet after it was flooded with complaints.

The ad said: 'We feel naked; you were never supposed to see this Bare Fare! It was meant for someone special (who isn't you).

'Now it's all over the Internet for you to take advantage of as you see fit. Scandalous! 

'We thought the cloud was our friend, y'know, because we spend so much time flying with 'em.

'But now our private prices are on display! Bad for us; GREAT for you.'

MailOnline Travel has contacted Spirit Airlines for comment.

Twitter users weren't amused by the ad, pointing out the massive invasion of privacy and embarrassment suffered by the hackers' victims.

Marc Peters wrote: 'Don't care how low @SpiritAirlines fares get. Not ever flying with them again when they pull stuff like this'.

Akil Hooper said: 'Hey @SpiritAirlines this is vile and you should be ashamed of yourselves.'

Another user, Casie Connolly, wrote: 'Safe to say thanks to Spirit Airlines 'Bare Fare' promotion, I'll never consider flying this airline again'.

Spirit Airlines has a history of producing edgy ads based on famous people's misery or world events.

The airline has previously mocked former politician Anthony Weiner, who sent a lewd photo to a woman on his Twitter account, and golfer Tiger Woods after he crashed his luxury vehicle.

It was previously criticised for its 'Check Out The Oil On Our Beaches' ad campaign, which featured bikini-clad women, in reference to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
