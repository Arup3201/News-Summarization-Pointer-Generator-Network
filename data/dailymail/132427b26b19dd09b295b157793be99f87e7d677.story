Most drivers sent up the wrong lane by a satnav would curse and turn around – however when you’re Paul Daniels it appears the power of magic can summon help in the form of a police escort.

The magician and his wife Debbie McGee, 55, were making their way back to their hotel after performing at a local theatre when they realised they were heading in the wrong direction.

But with a wave of his wand and a tap of his black top hat, the pair encountered traffic officers who were more than happy to assist them.

And so grateful was Daniels, 76, he shared his good fortune with his Twitter followers on Thursday night telling them: ‘Satnav sent us up a lane to wrong side of river. Got a police escort to the hotel. Nice guys. Thank you.’

And it appears the officers were equally as chuffed to encounter the celebrity couple and also disclosed the news on Twitter posting a message on Kent Police RPU@kentpoliceroads using one of the entertainer’s well-known catchphrases: ‘You’ll like this..not a lot!’

Before continuing: ‘Just met Paul Daniels and Debbie McGee. Assisted them to find their hotel! Magic!’

Daniels and Miss McGee, who have been married for 26 years, are currently on their nationwide Back... Despite Popular Demand tour and had performed at the Hazlitt Theatre in Maidstone, Kent, on Thursday night.

The magician’s recent encounter with the law is better than the one he experienced last year when he escaped a driving ban after arguing he needed to care for his elderly mother Nancy, who passed away in January.

Daniels admitted driving above 40mph on London Road, Earley, near Reading on 23 July in 2013.

He received three points for the offence, taking his total to 12, but was excused from disqualification by Oxford magistrates.

The 75-year-old, whose real name is Newton Edward Daniels, was fined £625.

He was also ordered to pay a £62 victim surcharge and £65 costs.

Daniels’ television career began on ITV before he made the move to the BBC.

As well as numerous appearances on magic shows, he has presented game shows including Wipe Out and Odd One Out.

In 2010, he appeared as a contestant on BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing.
