Former Dr Who assistant Karen Gillan: Redheads still face prejudice despite prominence of stars with red hair and numbers of women who dye their hair red

They suffer a lot of stick for their unusual hair colouring, with hurtful taunts of 'Ginger!' resonating around playgrounds across the country.

Despite the prominence of stars Karen Gillan, Prince Harry and Damien Lewis, redheads still complain that they fall victim to prejudice and discrimination.

But new research shows that, far from being rare, Britain and Ireland are in fact host to a secret army of red hair gene carriers.

The results of the study, published today, indicate that more than 20million people in the UK and Ireland have the genes that can cause red hair.

The researchers have put together the 
first-ever map detailing the distribution of red-headed genes across 
the two countries, showing exactly where red heads are most 
concentrated.

The most 
red-headed part of Britain and Ireland is the South-East of Scotland 
with Edinburgh as a red-hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three
 common red hair gene variants.

But
 the biggest surprise revealed by the research is just over 34 per cent 
of the population of parts of the north of England are carriers, making 
Yorkshire and Humberside as red-headed as Ireland.

The
 results of the year-long project have been published today by ancestry 
company Britain's DNA to coincide with the Redhead Convention to be held
 in Crosshaven, County Cork, Ireland, this weekend.

It
 comes in the wake of the UK's first ever Ginger Pride march in 
Edinburgh a fortnight ago, where more than a hundred redheads paraded 
through the streets to demonstrate against prejudice against people with
 red hair.

A spokesman for BritainsDNA said: 'No-one needs a DNA test to tell if they have red hair. All they need is a mirror. What BritainsDNA set out to discover was a hidden story, one never before told. This is the story of the secret carriers.

'Since red hair is recessive, children born with red hair need both parents to be carriers of one of the red hair gene variants.

'But millions of people in Britain and Ireland have no idea that they are carriers. Our project at last reveals just how red-headed a nation we really are.'

The study has found that the 'number of people is Britain and Ireland who are carriers is very large indeed. We estimate a total of 20.4 million people are carriers of the red hair variants,' the spokesman added.

'That should help play down ginger jibes.'

This map produced by BritainsDNA shows where redheaded genes are concentrated. The most red-headed part of Britain and Ireland is the South-East of Scotland with Edinburgh as a red-hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three common red hair gene variants

The study is based on data from 2,343 people who have undergone DNA tests to learn more about their ancestry. Researchers looked at three different variants of the MC1R gene, which causes red hair.

According to BritainsDNA, those with 151-Cysteine-red have a 70,000 year old variant that probably arose in West Asia; those with 160-Tryptophan-red are descendants of someone who probably also lived in West Asia 70,000 years ago; and 294-Histidine-reds belong to a much younger group who come from a European who lived about 30,000 years ago.

In order for a child to develop red hair, both parents must be carriers of one of these red-hair gene variants. But even then there is only a 25 per cent their child will be born ginger.

Approximately 6 per cent of Scots have red hair, or about 300,000 people. Of the English, about 4 per cent - around 2.1million people - are red heads.

Dr Jim Wilson, a geneticist at Edinburgh University and chief scientist at Britain's DNA, said: 'The big surprise for me was that the frequency of the redhead variants was lower in the NW of Scotland, where many people probably think there are more redheads than elsewhere.

'However, this makes sense when we realise that just like in the Midlands and South of England, this probably means that the genes of the indigenous people have been diluted, in the north by Norse Vikings and in the south by Anglo-Saxons.'

BritainsDNA now hopes to continue their study further using new state of the art gene testing technology which can test for all known variants of the MC1R gene.

Once completed they expect to find the number of red hair gene carriers is even higher.
