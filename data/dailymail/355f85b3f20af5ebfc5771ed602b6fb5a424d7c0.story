Back in the gym: Gabby Douglas, 18, is going back to training for the next Olympic games after briefly pursuing an entertainment career (pictured in January)

Olympic gold medalist Gabby Douglas is reuniting with the coach who helped her win gold in 2012.

Gymnastics coach Liang Chow said on Sunday that the 2012 Olympic all-around gymnastics champion will return to train at his gym in West Des Moines, Iowa.

Douglas left Chow last August to live in Los Angeles, raising questions about her ability to return to the Olympics in 2016 because she would miss training time.

Chow says he is excited to work with Douglas again, but she faces a number of hurdles before returning to competition.

'We are welcoming Gabby to come back in our gym,' Chow responded to The Des Moines Register via text message.

'We
 are all excited to see her next week. It is hard for me to make any 
detailed training plan at this point since I have not seen her for a 
long time.'

When she moved 
to Los Angeles last fall, she said that she would continue to train and 
search for a coach out there while she was also pursuing other 
opportunities.

She was a judge on the reality show 'So You Think You Can Dance' and gave a number of interviews to celebrity outlets.

Douglas left her hometown of Virginia Beach in 2010 when she was just 14 in order to train with Chow in Iowa.

He
 earned his reputation within the gymnastics community after being the 
coach of Shawn Johnson, the 2007 World Champion and 2008 gold medalist.

After
 two years of training with Chow in Iowa, Douglas went on to win gold in
 the all-around and team competitions at the 2012 Olympic Games in 
London.

'I know it will be a lot of challenges ahead of us,' Chow on Sunday.

'The real test will be to see how tough Gabby can be to achieve her goals and to meet all of our training expectations.'

Douglas became a household- and historic- name during the 2012 games, as she is the first African American gymnast to win the individual all-around competition and the first american to win multiple golds.

That dream was almost cut short because of the trouble she had being away from her family, as she almost left Iowa six months before the London games because she was homesick.

With her sights set on returning to the mat in Rio for the 2016 Summer Games, Douglas went back to training in Iowa in May only to leave again in August.
