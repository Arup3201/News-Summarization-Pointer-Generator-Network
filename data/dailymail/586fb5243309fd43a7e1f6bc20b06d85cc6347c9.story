Back to his roots: the Reggae Reggae Sauce creator at Brixton Market, close where he grew up

British-Jamaican chef, musician and entrepreneur Levi Roots is adamant that the key to turning rags into riches is having a mentor.

And he should know, he’s had a few – from the prison worker who convinced him to leave a life of crime behind, to Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones, who created a global brand from Levi’s Reggae Reggae Sauce.

Now he’s passing his advice on to schoolchildren on his nationwide School Of Life Tour, which aims to get young people excited about cooking and making music, as well as motivating them to succeed.

‘I want to show them it doesn’t matter what your background is – if you work hard and are determined you can be a success,’ he says.

Back in 2007, wearing his sharpest suit and his most infectious smile, Levi serenaded the stars of Dragons’ Den with his Reggae Reggae Sauce song. His performance secured him a £50,000 investment in return for 40 per cent of the business from Dragons Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh.

Almost immediately Sainsbury’s announced it would be stocking Levi’s sauce in 600 of its stores, and within weeks it became its fastest-selling product.

The Reggae Reggae brand now has some 50 products, from table sauces to soft drinks, rocketing Levi to multi-millionaire status.

‘Peter saw beyond the sauce and was sold on my song,’ laughs Levi, 54.

‘He’s the most important mentor in my life. He made the crucial phone call that got the sauce into Sainsbury’s.

'It
was surreal going from selling the sauce on a market stall to seeing 
them on shelves all over the country. It was the most amazing thing 
that’s happened to me.’

But it was a long slog. Levi had been 
selling the sauce himself from market stalls since 1991 while trying to 
make it as a musician, having been rejected for loans from banks for 16 
years on the grounds that the sauce sounded ‘too black’.

It was when he started to feel the pinch with his seven children that he realised he had to change tack.

‘The time came when I realised I wasn’t making any money, so I decided 
to merge the music and food and give a bit of soul to the sauce. And 
I’ve never looked back, thanks to Peter.’

Peter was the one who warned Levi that success also brings trouble.

On
the show Levi claimed the secret recipe for his sauce was handed down 
by his grandmother Miriam. But his former business partner, chef Tony 
Bailey, accused Levi of stealing the recipe the pair used when they ran a
stall at Notting Hill Carnival.

Bailey attempted to sue Levi for more than £600,000, but Levi won the case in 2011 after the judge ruled he didn’t steal the recipe.

Levi says he feels no cause to celebrate. ‘Peter always told me my story was too good to be true and to be prepared for someone to throw a spanner at me. But I never expected the spanner to be thrown from so close to home. I still feel hurt.’

Levi was born Keith Valentine Graham in Jamaica, the youngest of six raised by his grandmother, as his elder siblings moved to the UK, one by one, after his parents came to Britain to start a new life.

‘As they established themselves here they could afford to bring one child over each year. But as I was the youngest, I was the last to arrive. So my grandmother brought me up.

'She was too poor to send me to school but she taught me to cook. We lived entirely off fresh fruit, herbs and spices from the garden and although there was no money, there were always good meals on the table.

‘Food and music have always gone hand
in hand for me. When I was playing, food was always there. I’d be 
rustling up dishes in a pot and pan in the dressing room when we were on
tour.’

'We cooked outside all the time,’ says Levi, whose latest book, Grill It With Levi: 101 Reggae Recipes For Sunshine And Soul, is close to his heart as it concentrates on the Caribbean traditions of barbecuing and grilling.

Although in the court case Levi admitted it was a marketing ploy to claim the Reggae Reggae sauce recipe was his grandmother’s, he says, ‘My grandmother taught me how to cook and one of the key things in Caribbean cooking is jerk chicken sauce. So I learnt how she did it and later perfected the recipe at home over many years.’

At the age of 12, his parents sent for him to join them in Brixton, south London.

‘When I arrived I couldn’t spell my own name. At school I just tried to be cool by showing everyone I could open a bottle of pop without a bottle opener, as I couldn’t read or write. My mum took me to the library where I learnt to read from the Famous Five books.

‘But at home, the kitchen was my haven. Mum was busy working and my father worked nights as a rat catcher for the council, and as he went to work at 6pm, I’d have to cook dinner for him: classic Caribbean dishes I’d learnt from my grandmother, like goat curry, dumplings and soups.'

Despite this homely life, Levi says 
he was drawn into a life of crime as he grew up in Brixton in the 1970s 
while trying to carve out a career in music.

Aged
15 he was sent to Pentonville prison for six months charged with 
assault on a police officer. In 1986, police raided the youth club he 
ran and he was jailed again for possession of drugs.

‘In prison I met a woman who really 
inspired me. She taught prisoners how to get ready for the outside world
and she said to me, “You’re not Keith. Keith is bad and gets into 
trouble.”

'So as I lay in my prison cell bed I left behind Keith Graham and became known by my Rastafarian name, Levi Roots.’

Deciding to stay on the right side of the law, Levi persevered with his music. He formed a band called Matic 16, performed with James Brown and was nominated for a Best Reggae Act MOBO award in 1998.

‘Food and music have always gone hand in hand for me. When I was playing, food was always there. I’d be rustling up dishes in a pot and pan in the dressing room when we were on tour.’

Levi’s ongoing School Of Life Tour follows Government proposals for compulsory cookery lessons for pupils aged seven to 14 to be introduced from 2014.

‘If you can combine your two passions you have the best job in the world. That’s what I tell all the pupils I see,’ says Levi, whose tailor-made school visits include a flavour of his music, some tips on how to succeed in business and a cookery lesson.

‘Too many youngsters see cooking as dull or laborious, which is just not true. And I tell them everyone needs a mentor. I’ve been in business for five years now and the Reggae Reggae products have sold millions – but I still have a mentor in Peter Jones.’ For more information on Levi Roots’ School of Life Tour, visit www.reggae-reggae.co.uk.
