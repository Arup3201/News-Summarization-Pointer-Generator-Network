Tens of thousands of Hamas supporters formed a sea of green as they marched through Gaza City to mark 27 years since the formation of Islamist movement Hamas.

'Just as we liberated Gaza... we will repeat the experience in the West Bank,' senior Hamas leader Mahmud al-Zahar said in a speech at a similar march in southern Gaza.

The burning alive in July of a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem, a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli teens in the West Bank, sparked months of unrest and led to a bloody 50-day summer war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas.

Israel blamed Hamas for the Israeli murders, and rounded up hundreds of its members in the West Bank.

Both sides claimed the Gaza conflict as a victory.

Fathy Hammad, a former cabinet minister, saw the large
turnout as showing Hamas - the de facto rulers of Gaza - remained popular despite the war's
devastation and the hardships of an Egyptian and Israeli
blockade of the coastal territory.

He said: 'Once one road is blocked, another one opens.'

But he cautioned against Palestinian frustration with what
they see as a slow pace of efforts to rebuild homes and other
property, warning this could bring about further confrontation.

'We will extract reconstruction by our rifles, if there will
be no rebuilding, there will be another explosion,' Mr Hammad told
those gathered at a rally in Gaza's Jebalya refugee camp.

Elsewhere, Israeli troops opened fire with live rounds at a group of 100 Palestinian demonstrators outside a military prison near Ramallah, hitting 10 of them in the legs, Palestinian medical sources said.

They were protesting the death of a senior official who died in a confrontation with Israeli troops.

Yesterday, thousands of Palestinians gathered to mourn Ziad Abu Ein as the army sent reinforcements to the West Bank and braced for unrest.

The Palestinian leadership blamed Israel for the 'killing' of the 55-year-old, as tensions threatened to boil over into another round of violence in the occupied territories. 

Abu Ein died on Wednesday after a confrontation with Israeli soldiers during a protest march against settlements by roughly 300 Palestinians who intended to plant olive trees as a symbolic act, an AFP photographer said.

Troops fired tear gas, three soldiers grabbed Abu Ein and he was struck in the chest during the confrontation. Videos circulating online showed the soldiers pushing Abu Ein firmly in the chest and neck.

He collapsed and was treated by an Israeli army doctor, but died later in hospital. 

And today, a Palestinian man threw a
chemical substance believed to be acid  at an Israeli family in
the occupied West Bank, injuring a man and four
children, Israeli police and the military said.

The assailant was shot and wounded immediately after the
attack, which took place at a checkpoint south of Jerusalem.
