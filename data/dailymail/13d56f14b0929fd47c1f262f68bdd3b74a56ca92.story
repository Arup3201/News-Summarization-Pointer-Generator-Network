Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin was best friends both on and off the field with his alleged tormentor-in-chief Richie Incognito, claims the team's quarterback.

Martin walked out on the Dolphins last week after reportedly suffering a catalogue of abuse, including a racist voice mail message, from guard Incognito, who has been suspended.

But according to quaterback Ryan Tannehill, far from being enemies, the pair were in fact close friends who would 'hang out' together off the field.

'Best friends': Richie Incognito, left, and Jonathan Martin, right, were close friends claims Dolphins' Quaterback Ryan Tannehill

Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Jonathan Martin

Tannehill said: 'If you had asked Jon Martin a week before who his best friend on the team was, he would have said Richie Incognito.

'The
first guy to stand up for Jonathan when anything went down on the 
field, any kind of tussle, Richie was the first guy there.

'When they wanted to hang out outside of football, who was together? Richie and Jonathan.'

After leaving the team last week, Martin briefly checked himself into a South Florida hospital to be treated for emotional distress.

The Dolphins's management arranged for his parents to travel to South Florida from their home in California where he is now staying.

His father Gus told omg! Insider: 'He's a strong man. He's doing fine.'

According to one source, who did not wish to be named, Martin
had considered giving up the sport because he was mistreated by other 
offensive linemen.

The source added Martin, who sought counseling for emotional issues, now plans to continue playing.

Incognito
was reportedly told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin when he subjected
his teammate to abusive voice mail and texts messages.

It
has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team 
activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the 
offensive line's undisputed leader, to 'get [Martin] into the fold.'

Just
days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive voice 
mail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ 
threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words 
‘I'll kill you.’

Last week,
Martin's agent said the second-year player from Stanford was harassed 
almost daily by teammates in his rookie year and the hazing continued 
into this season.

That 
prompted an NFL investigation, and the Dolphins suspended Incognito, who
sources said sent Martin threatening and racist messages during the 
offseason.

The Dolphins suspended Incognito late Sunday for misconduct related to the alleged harassment of Martin, who abruptly left the team a week ago to receive help for emotional issues

Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed a New York lawyer with experience in sports cases to investigate the case.

The
controversy attracted more than 100 reporters and cameramen to the 
Dolphins' complex Wednesday, and when the throng entered the locker room
after practice, a player pushed the button on a boom box sitting at 
Incognito's stall and Circus music began to play.

Dolphins'
players have rallied passionately defended Incognito and insisting they
didn't see the blowup coming. Most said Martin and Incognito were 
friends.

'I don't know why 
he's doing this," offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said. "And the only 
person who knows why, his name is Jonathan Martin.'

Guard John Jerry said he never heard Incognito use the racist term included in one voicemail and wouldn't have objected anyway.

'I
would have just laughed it off,' Jerry said. 'I know the type of person
he is, and I know he doesn't mean it that way. Everybody's got friends 
that when you're out, they say those type of things. It's never made a 
big deal.'

Was Incognito under orders? It isn't clear whether the instructions to 'toughen up' Martin came from head coach Joe Philbin, pictured, or another coach

The 30-year-old 
Incognito was kicked off his team at Nebraska, and has long had a 
reputation as one of the NFL's dirtiest players. But he has been 
universally praised by his teammates this week.

'Does he like to give guys a hard time? Yes. Does he like to pester guys and have fun? Yes,' Tannehill said.

'But
he brought a lot of laughter to this locker room, he brought a lot of 
cohesiveness to this locker room and he was the best teammate that I 
could ask for.'

For Martin,
the final straw was a lunchroom prank at the team complex, and he then 
left the squad. Tannehill and Jerry said the same prank has been pulled 
on many other players.

Hijinks are especially common among the offensive linemen, Clabo said.

'We
have a system of basically it's just a big joke, basically,' he said. 
'It helps camaraderie. It keeps things light in the room. Everyone 
participates. No one is exempt and so I don't see how ... we would all 
be guilty of bullying.'

The 24-year-old Martin was briefly hospitalized after he left the team and is now with his family in California.

Tannehill said he was shocked when Martin departed.

He
added: 'The whole thing, it's kind of mind-blowing to me. It's kind of 
mind-blowing to most of the guys on our team right now.

'It's tough for me, because you can't help a situation that you didn't know existed - that no one on this team knew existed.

'We
have a bunch of good guys in this locker room. To be put in a situation
where everyone's attacking the locker room saying it's such a bad 
place, such a bad culture, no leadership to stand up and stop the 
situation - no one knew there was a situation to be stopped.'
