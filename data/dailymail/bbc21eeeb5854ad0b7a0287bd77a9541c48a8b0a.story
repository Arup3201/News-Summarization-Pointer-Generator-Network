Former BBC boss Greg Dyke has branded Jeremy Clarkson a 'disaster waiting to happen' amid claims the presenter punched a Top Gear producer.

The FA Chairman said the BBC has been placed in an impossible position and 'can't win either way' whatever the outcome of the Top Gear Inquiry.

Clarkson, who is currently suspended after allegedly hitting Oisin Tymon in a row over hot food, has reportedly promised to sue the BBC if he is sacked from the popular show.

Speaking to ITV News today, Mr Dyke said: 'First of all I'd say that I don't think Jeremy Clarkson is the first presenter I've met who would have liked to have thumped his producer.

'But in truth he is a disaster waiting to happen really for the BBC. It's hard to…I'm glad I'm not the executive who has to take that decision because if you were, you can't win either way now.'

The former BBC Director General added: 'Even if you decide to keep Jeremy…what happens next?'

Clarkson allegedly believes that the BBC have launched a 'smear campaign' against him which he 'won't let go'.

Sources close to the 54-year-old have said he is likely to take action against the Corporation for wrongful dismissal, if he is not reinstated to the programme. 

It comes amid reports that the BBC are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called The Getaway Car, which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges. 

Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas', prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air.

The four Top Gear roadshows scheduled for Norway next weekend have been postponed.

Tickets for the postponed shows cost between £42 and £100, meaning the decision could cost the BBC more than £1million in lost revenue if Clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled. 

Sacking Clarkson could mean the end of Top Gear, which makes the BBC millions every year

Speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general.

The BBC’s internal inquiry into Clarkson’s fracas with Mr Oisin is expected to made public as soon as Tuesday.

It is being led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland who oversaw the investigation into the disastrous Newsnight edition that falsely accused the late Conservative peer Lord McAlpine of being involved in the north Wales child abuse scandal. 

The presenter launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala last week.

Speaking at an event in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, Clarkson said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'.

He said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me.

'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' 

But the under-fire presenter claimed that the 'sweary' incident had all been in good humour.

Writing in his column in the Sunday Times, he said: 'I woke up after a night at a charity do to be told by my lawyer that someone had uploaded a video of me using choice language to describe bosses at the BBC.

'But it was all meant in jest and anyway it worked. By being brief, controversial and a bit sweary I woke the room up and the auction prize I was offering - one last lap of the Top Gear test track - raised £100,000.'

The Top Gear frontman revealed that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations.

He said: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.' 

Insiders suggested Clarkson and Mr Tymon had given ‘quite different’ versions of events. 

Sources close to Mr Tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip, while Clarkson has admitted some ‘handbags and pushing’ but is understood to have denied anything worse. 

The BBC was given a reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank.

The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street.

Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes.

There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way

The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' 

It emerged yesterday that a report into Clarkson's behaviour was commissioned by BBC head of TV Danny Cohen after a series of other scandals last year.

Top Gear caused an international incident after driving through Argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the Falklands War and used the word 'slope' describe an Asian man.

A report into the cases apparently concluded that Top Gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show's team and the BBC's management to help deal with any future crisis.

The BBC today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions. 

There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way.

‘The programme could and should have carried on during Clarkson’s suspension,’ said an insider. ‘Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings.

‘He has a great deal of public support... But he does need to rest and sort himself out.’ 

David Cameron's 11-year-old daughter Nancy has gone on hunger strike in protest at the presenter's suspension from Top Gear.

She has threatened not to eat until the  presenter was restored to the BBC One show.

Mr Cameron said: 'Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored.

'We told her that this is not necessarily a useful intervention - he’s not exactly Gandhi.'
