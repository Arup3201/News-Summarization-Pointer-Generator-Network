Shot in the face: Evie White was struck just below her lip with the 4in metal crossbow bolt as she was leaving Canterbury College in Kent

A 17-year-old beauty student was shot in the face with a crossbow as she walked out of college and was forced to wrench the 4in metal bolt from her lip as blood poured from the wound.

Evie White was struck while leaving Canterbury College in Kent, and screamed for help in shock as horrified friends searched in vain for the person responsible.

The student was rushed to hospital with her clothes covered in blood and has been left with a nasty gash just below her lip - which doctors say will leave minor scarring.

Evie said: 'My friends were staring at me in disbelief, they didn't say a word.

'Then I touched my face and felt the blood and thought "What the hell is that in my cheek" - and pulled the dart out and chucked it on the floor.

'There was a lot of blood coming from my lip, but I think I must have been in shock because I wasn't really feeling the pain, but my friends were hysterically crying.'

Her friend Georgia Brazil, 17, who is on the same hair and beauty course at Canterbury College, witnessed the disturbing incident.

She said: 'This thing just hit her in the face. All we saw was Evie drop her things on the floor and her mouth just filled with blood.

'She just kept saying "Can someone please help me? Please help me".

'I had a look around where the dart seemed to have been fired but couldn't see anyone - I've got no idea where it came from. It was really, really scary.'

Brave: The beauty student, who will escape with minor scarring, pulled the metal bolt from her face 

Dangerous weapon: The person who fired the bolt (pictured) is yet to be identified by police

Witnesses trained in first aid and college security guards ran to assist Evie and called for an ambulance and the police.

Evie's father John says he arrived at the college to find his daughter covered in blood after receiving an urgent call from a tutor.

He said: 'I really panicked at first but thought it might have been the girls in her class playing about with a dart - definitely nothing this serious.

'When we arrived, Evie was in the ambulance and had been wrapped in bandages because there was a lot of blood - it was all over her clothes.

Shaken: The college's headmaster, Alison Clarke, has described the incident as 'very frightening'

'I was angry at first, but I just feel lucky that she wasn't more seriously hurt.'

Evie was taken to hospital for treatment and doctors say she will escape with minor scarring.

College headmaster Alison Clarke said: 'This is clearly a very frightening event and our thoughts are with the young lady and her family and friends. '

Police say two people have since given an account of what happened, with speculation that it could have been a freak accident.

A spokesman said: 'Two people have since come forward and been spoken to by officers in relation to the incident.

'No arrests have been made and officers are considering what, if any, further action should be taken.'

Evie, of Upstreet, near Canterbury, Kent, says firing a crossbow in public, even without intent to injure someone, should be a criminal offence.

She added: 'I think it has probably scared me more than it's hurt me.'
