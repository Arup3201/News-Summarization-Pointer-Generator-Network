Psychiatric injury: Former police officer John Pike is seeking worker's compensation after the controversial incident

The former police officer who sparked worldwide outrage when he pepper-sprayed students during an Occupy protest at the University of California, Davis, is now appealing for worker's compensation.

John Pike claims he suffered psychiatric injury from the November 2011 confrontation and its aftermath.

After he was seen on video casually spraying an orange cloud of pepper spray at the heads of protesters, his personal information was released by hackers and he received numerous threats.

Pike has a settlement conference set 
for Aug. 13 in Sacramento, according to the state Department of 
Industrial Relations' website.

He was fired in July 2012, eight months after a task force investigation found that his action was unwarranted.

Online
 videos of him and another officer casually dousing demonstrators with 
pepper spray went viral, sparking outrage at UC Davis leaders.

The images became a rallying symbol for the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Hacking group Anonymous posted Pike's information online. This included his home address, phone number and email address.

A computer-generated voice in the video, posted in November 2011, said: 'Dear Officer John Pike. Your information is now public domain.'

It was then removed because was deeemed 'a violation of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech.'

Anonymous has threatened or claimed credit for attacks on numerous media organizations, including Fox News - but was the first time the hacking group targeted an individual.

The group said: 'We have no problem targeting police and releasing their information even if it puts them at risk. We want them to experience just a taste of the brutality and misery they serve us on an everyday basis.'

Pike received scores of threats that led an Alameda County Court judge to rule against releasing the names of other officers at the scene.

The hackers' video concluded: 'Expect our full wrath. Anonymous seeks to avenge all protesters. We are going to make you squeal like a pig.'

This week, a state appeals court ruled news organizations are entitled to know the names of a dozen University of California police officers who were interviewed about the use of pepper spray on demonstrators at UC Davis.

The Los Angeles Times and The Sacramento Bee are seeking the officers' identities, which were redacted from two reports on the incident.

In the aftermath, the University of California agreed to pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit filed by demonstrators and the chief of the UC Davis police department resigned.
