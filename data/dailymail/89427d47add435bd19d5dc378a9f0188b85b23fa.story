German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to announce a eurozone bailout

Confusion is currently surrounding whether Germany is prepared to back a £600billion bailout scheme to rescue the crumbling euro.

Last night, European leaders were said to be inching towards a deal.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was understood to be poised to announce that two eurozone funds worth €750billion (£605billion) would be used to buy up the debts of Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and others.

The move would essentially mean Germany and the wealthy countries of the eurozone would underwrite struggling member states.

But now sources are saying Germany may not actually be backing the package, and has so far not agreed to a deal.

Officials have already conceded the scheme
will be only a stopgap – designed to reduce the eye-watering borrowing 
costs for eurozone members – while they take steps towards a true 
‘fiscal union’.

Despite
eurozone assistance for Spain’s tottering banking sector, the interest 
rates charged by international lenders on its debts soared this week 
above 7 per cent - the danger point at which Greece, Portugal and 
Ireland had to seek bailouts.

Investors treated the announcement cautiously, with European shares steady today.

The FTSE-100 is 0.48 per cent up at 5,613.12; France's CAC 40 is 0.14 per cent up at 3,122.24; and Germany's DAX is 0.37 per cent up at 6,387.21.

The
European Financial Stability Facility, worth £202billion, and the 
European Stability Mechanism, worth £403billion, are the schemes that 
would be used to buy up the struggling countries’ debts.

Previously,
the funds have been designed to make bailouts directly to stricken 
governments, such as commitments to austerity measures.

But in the future, if the deal is confirmed, they would be used to buy up government debts. Governments would be expected to have to make a request for the funds to buy up bonds used to raise cash, and conditions could be imposed.

Out of order: French President Francois Hollande (left) said the rates paid on borrowed debts by Spain and Italy were unacceptable, while laws put in place by George Osborne (right) means Britain will not have to contribute

Britain does not contribute to either fund after Chancellor George Osborne changed the law to get us off the hook.

Mr Osborne, speaking at the meeting of the G20 group of leading economies in Los Cabos, Mexico, said last night: ‘I think one thing we have learnt is don’t expect a single summit to solve the eurozone’s problems, otherwise you are going to be disappointed.

‘I am not claiming that this summit has solved those problems, but the eurozone is inching towards solutions.

‘Basically, we do need to see the richer countries, like Germany, like Holland, spend some of their resources in propping up the weaker countries of the eurozone.

‘Obviously it is difficult for them to do that, it is not a popular thing to do, but it is absolutely necessary.

'It’s a reminder of why we are not in the euro because I think British taxpayers would find these things difficult to stomach.

'But British taxpayers need to see the eurozone sort their act out if we are going to get sustainable growth and jobs.

‘We will see what the eurozone announce over the next couple of weeks, but there is no doubt that they realise that individual measures in individual countries.

'Like recapitalising Spanish banks and getting a Greek government in favour of staying in the euro and doing what is necessary to stay in the euro – are not by themselves enough.

‘These are systemic problems in the eurozone which require a systemic answer and we need to see measures from the eurozone that help bring borrowing costs down, that help ensure there are common resources transferred from richer countries to poorer countries, that the whole eurozone stands behind the banks of the eurozone.’

French President Francois Hollande promised ‘mechanisms that allow us to fight speculation’.

He said rates paid by Spain and Italy to borrow on debt markets were ‘unacceptable’.

The European Central Bank has already bought €210billion in bonds issued by eurozone governments, but stopped the programme last year amid German resistance.

Mrs Merkel has been hugely resistant to moves that would result in her having to persuade German taxpayers that their money should be used to prop up troubled members of the eurozone. And German officials insisted no decisions had been reached on whether to use the eurozone bailout cash to buy up government debts.

The latest move, which G20 officials suggested could be announced within days, will be seen as the first step towards sharing the burden of stricken countries’ debts across the single currency’s 17 members.

However, it falls short of the ‘eurobonds’ – collective eurozone debts – first proposed by European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso.

Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for the EU's eurozone commissioner Olli Rehn, said it would likely only work for 'a certain time' and would not resolve root tensions.

He said: 'It would be financial paracetamol. It could soothe tension, pain and malaise, but it does not heal the root causes, the structural problems of the economies of Italy, Spain and others.

'It is not a substitute for structural and economic reforms that can boost confidence.'

The G20 summit communique, agreed last night, promised ‘important steps towards greater fiscal and economic integration that lead to sustainable borrowing costs’.

In another development, the US and the EU were expected to agree to negotiate a free trade deal by 2014. Officials said the move would be worth huge amounts to economies on both sides of the Atlantic.

U.S. President Barack Obama voiced confidence in Europe's ability to 'break the fever' of its raging debt crisis as he sought to calm both global financial markets and the election-year worries of voters at home.

Obama, speaking at the close of the Group of 20 economic summit, said Europe's leaders showed a 'heightened sense of urgency' during two days of talks.

The president maintained Europe had the capacity to solve the crisis on its own, indicating the U.S., still battling its own economic woes, would not be offering any financial pledges to help its international partners.

He said: 'Even if they cannot achieve all of it in one fell swoop, I think if people have a sense of where they are going that can provide confidence and break the fever.'

Obama waded deep into the summit discussions on Europe's debt crisis, which could have repercussions both for a U.S. economy still struggling to recover from a recession and Obama's own re-election prospects.

He acknowledged that 'all of this affects the United States' but that his administration does not have control over how quickly the Europeans fix the problems.

He said: 'All of these issues, economic issues, will potentially have some impact on the election.'

Mindful of his audience of voters in the U.S., Obama added: 'The best thing the United States can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term.'
