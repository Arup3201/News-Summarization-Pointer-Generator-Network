The statement given to WUSA9 read: 'On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need. 

'We recognize the dedicated efforts from Anne Arundel County Fire and Police Departments, the Naval Academy, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and other first responders. We want our community to know how proud we are of all who have helped us.

'Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.'

Investigators on Wednesday found two bodies  in the charred remains of the home in Annapolis, Maryland after the property burned to the ground on Monday.

The bodies were with the medical examiner and have not yet been identified. It is not known whether the bodies children of adults.  

Federal and local investigators returned to the site to continue the search on Thursday.  

Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra.

Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren. They have not been accounted for 

'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 

'It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.' 

The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early on Monday.

The blaze has reduced the 16,000-square-foot waterfront castle to ruins. 

The fire was reported about 3.30am on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. 

Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside.

Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby.

Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish on Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed.

Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play.

Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning.

The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. 

Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack.

However, Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene.

Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court. 

Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people'.

Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies.

In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. 

His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia.

He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted.

His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value.

Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty.

Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement.

Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. 

ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic.

'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'
