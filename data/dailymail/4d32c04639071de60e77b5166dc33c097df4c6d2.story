Custom-designed personal electronics could soon be available thanks to a new material that can be used to 3D print objects including working sensors.

The material, nicknamed ‘carbomorph’, enables users to lay down electronic tracks and sensors as part of a 3D printed structure.

This could, for example, allow the printer to create touch-sensitive areas which can then be connected to a simple electronic circuit board.

Breakthrough: Warwick University's Dr Simon Leigh holds a video games controller he and his team 3D printed using a new material that is both conductive and piezo-resistive

The revolutionary new material was created by a team from the University of Warwick, who have so far used it to to print gloves with embedded flex sensors and computer game controllers with touch-sensitive buttons.

The next step is to work on printing much more complex structures and electronic components including the wires and cables required to connect the devices to computers.

Dr Simon Leigh of Warwick's School of Engineering led the research, which is detailed in a study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.

While 3D printers have until now been 
useful for basic prototyping, the products they create are 
disappointingly inert and functional elements like electronic sensors 
have had to be to be manually attached.

'It’s always great seeing the complex and intricate models of devices such as mobile phones or television remote controls that can be produced with 3D printing,' Dr Leigh said.

'But that’s it, they are invariably models that don’t really function.'

'We set about trying to find a way in which we could actually print out a functioning electronic device from a 3D printer.'

In order to achieve their goal, Dr Leigh's team created carbomorph, a conductive medium which could be made into shapes with 3D printers.

It is based on Carbon Black filler, a readily available, inexpensive byproduct of the petrochemical industry, which conducts electricity.

The team mixed the Carbon Black with a readily available modelling plastic called polymorph until they had a substance that was usable in 3D printers but still conducted electricity.

Even more useful, the new material was also found to be piezo-resistive, meaning that its electrical resistance changes when it is squeezed.

The paper describes how the Warwick team were able to use multiple strips of carbomorph to build an 'exo-glove' which is capable of detecting fingers flexing, and in a release they showed a computer game controller made entirely of the stuff, right down to working buttons.

Dr Leigh and his team hope their new 
material could 'meet the demands of entrepreneurs, designers and artists
wishing to create ever more complex and high-tech products' using 3D 
printing.

Anyone in the world could soon have access to a 3D printable gun through the internet.

A U.S. start-up plans to distribute schematics for the weapons free of charge.

Defense Distributed, a company which wants to extend the U.S. Second Amendment rights to the entire world, hopes to test prototypes of the printable weapons by the end of the year.

'This project could very well change the way we think about gun control and consumption,' the organisation says on their website.

'How do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the Internet? Let’s find out.'

'In the long term,
this technology could revolutionise the way we produce the world 
around us, making products such as personal electronics a lot more 
individualised and unique and in the process reducing electronic waste,'
Dr Leigh said.

'Designers could also use it to understand better how people tactilely interact with products by monitoring sensors embedded into objects.

'However, in the short term I can see this technology having a major impact in the educational sector.

'For example, allowing the next generation of young engineers to get hands-on experience of using advanced manufacturing technology to design fairly high-tech devices and products right there in the classroom.'

The printed sensors can be monitored using existing open-source electronics and freely available programming libraries.

A major advantage of using 3D printing is that sockets for connection to equipment such as interface electronics can be printed out instead of connected using conductive glues or paints.
