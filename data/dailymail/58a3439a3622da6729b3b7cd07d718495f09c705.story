A group of incensed passengers prevented a top Pakistani politician from boarding a flight after they were kept waiting on the runway for two hours until he arrived.

A video clip shows Senator Rehman Malik, the country’s former Interior Minister being ejected from the Islamabad-bound Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight on Monday evening.

Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwani, a Member of National Assembly, was jeered in his seat and also forced to leave the plane. 

Disgruntled passengers can be heard referring to the men as ‘so-called VIPs’ as they wait for the two delayed politicians aboard the aircraft, while members of the flight’s cabin crew are seen attempting to calm the travellers down.

‘No, no, no, sir,’ one of the passengers responds. ‘We've taken it for too long. For 68 years. Are we going to take it for another 68 years?’

When Senator Malik finally appears, the angry passengers immediately begin hurling abuse forcing the politician to hurriedly retreat to the terminal building.

‘You should go back,’ shouts one. ‘You should apologise to these passengers. You should be ashamed of yourself, 250 passengers have suffered because of you. It is your fault, sir.’

Mr Malik initially appears to remonstrate but his comments are barely audible as they are drowned out by the furious passengers.

As Malik argues with the passengers, one traveller replies, ‘You are not a minister anymore!’

Rehman Malik was Pakistan's Interior Minister between 2008 and 2013.

Meanwhile, Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwani had already managed to board the plane when furious passengers also forced him out of his seat after chanting ‘shame, shame, shame’.

Rehman Malik later took to Twitter to defend himself and insisted that PIA should be blamed for the flight's delay and not himself

Mr Malik eventually boarded another plane to Islamabad after being refused entry to his initial flight

As he left the aircraft, most of the 250 passengers applauded.

Monday night's Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi to Islamabad eventually took off without the two men.

‘There are times when something you dream of actually happens, like Senator Rehman Malik getting booted off that Pakistan International Airlines flight,’ wrote Rabia Ahmed in a blog post for Pakistan's Express Tribune.

However, a spokesperson for PIA said that the delay was due to a technical issue and that they had informed people of this via text message.

Rehman Malik later took to Twitter to defend himself and insisted that PIA should be blamed for the flight's delay and not himself.

He later wrote: ‘I hv right to defend myself agst the allegation. PK370 /1900hr was delayed b/c tech reasons/was expected to leave at 2030. So no delay for me.

In a second Tweet, he wrote: ‘Aam now leaving by pk 300 and now in the plane.50 minutes delay has been announced who shd be blamed for this delay. PIA or me? Obviously PIA.
