After the heartbreak of Paris comes an altogether different challenge for  England’s rugby players this weekend.

As well as 15 Scotsmen thirsty for English blood there will be a muddy and maggot-infested  Murrayfield pitch one expert described as a ‘national embarrassment’.

Stuart Lancaster’s England team will be looking to bounce back with an emphatic victory, but their efforts could become mired in the Murrayfield mud. Last autumn Scottish rugby admitted there was a serious problem, and that they were using garlic — the  vampire-killers’ weapon of choice — to combat the worms.

The culprits — nematodes or, more commonly,  roundworms —  are not terribly partial to garlic. ‘It doesn’t kill them,’ said another expert, ‘but it does p*** them off enough to send them deeper into the soil.’

In 2014 there really is no excuse for the difficulties England might encounter if the Murrayfield pitch does quickly resemble a 1970s Match of the Day mud heap.

Nobody is accusing the Scots of foul play but England’s World Cup-winning forward Ben Kay believes the poor pitch could be ‘a leveller’, and therefore to Scotland’s advantage against a visiting side that would expect to be stronger in the scrum and faster, more powerful and more skilful with the ball in hand.

‘If you look at England’s front row, Dan Cole and Joe Marler are very much into the power scrummage,’ said the former lock. ‘They prefer a straight pushing contest to the traditional dark-arts encounter.

Meloidogyne minor is a nematode, a type of worm, that has infested the Scottish turf. Less than 1mm long, it is a parasite that feeds off the roots of plants, destroying them in the process. It was identified in 2007 in the Low Countries, where it damaged potato crops, before making its way to Britain. Golf courses have been affected, with yellow-brown patches of grass the  tell-tale sign, but now the pests have wormed their way into a stadium.

‘But if you can’t get traction because the pitch is cutting up, you have a problem. The Paris pitch isn’t great either and Cole suffered against the much shorter Thomas Domingo at the weekend.

‘If you think of England’s defeats at Murrayfield they were often on wet, muddy pitches.

‘Power runners don’t have the contact with the ground to break through and the players with skill don’t have the same confidence underfoot. England won’t use it as an excuse but they would prefer a fast, firm track.’

It was in September, before Scotland played Japan, South Africa and Australia on a dreadful surface, that Scottish rugby first acknowledged there was an issue.

Mark Laidlaw, SRU director  of management services, spoke  of ‘an excessive build-up of  nematodes which have caused  significant root damage’. He also warned that the surface ‘can weaken under the significant  pressure exerted by scrums’.

Leveller: The power of England's front row Dan Cole (R) and Joe Marler could be negated by the poor pitch

Laidlaw then said experts had been called in, using techniques that included the spraying of  garlic, and conceded it could take weeks to sort out. By January 13, however, a Scottish Rugby Union statement suggested little progress had been made. The pitch, it said, ‘is a matter of understandable concern’.

Edinburgh club games were moved to another ground so that England will be the first opponents to play on the pitch this year but yesterday Scottish Rugby admitted to Sportsmail that, even now, ‘the pitch is not in the pristine condition we enjoy normally at Murrayfield’.

Ground staff have been working to improve the situation but the idea that Scottish Rugby has in some way been unfortunate, that this infestation is a freak occurrence, is misleading.

Bright idea? Scottish rugby has been using lights to combat the problem, but that could help pests flourish

Most pitches in world sport will have some form of pest problem. In recent seasons Manchester City have had to use garlic spray and Arsenal’s playing surface, widely considered the finest in the Barclays Premier League, is believed to have a nematode problem.

‘There are thousands of different types of nematode and some are better than others,’ said one expert, ‘but the key is how you treat them and I’d question some of the advice they might have had up at Murrayfield.

‘They’ve been using lights on the pitch and that does promote grass growth. But, and I have to say I don’t know what kind of nematode they have, lights can also create a warm, bright environment that enable these pests to flourish.

‘There are different solutions but in 2014 you can see that the way forward is to introduce a mix of natural grass with artificial. England did that at Twickenham, as have the Irish at the Aviva.’

Grounds for complaint: Manchester City's Etihad Stadium is one of several Premier League pitches that have suffered pest problems

As part of their recent £70million redevelopment of Twickenham, the RFU invested in a state-of-the-art DESSO ‘hybrid grass’ pitch that was laid on top of 20 miles of new undersoil heating pipes in August 2012. The same surface is also found at the Aviva and at a number of leading  Premier League football clubs, including Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool.

Cardiff City have an excellent  DESSO pitch, too, and yet the Welsh Rugby Union are still  undecided as to the best way forward for the Millennium Stadium.

In the meantime, RBS 6 Nations rugby suffers because of poor pitches . . . as do the teams who want to play with power and a more expansive style.

After the defeat in Paris, England have enough on their plates without mud, maggots and garlic!
