Mourners have arrived at their loved ones’ graves to find their headstones plastered in yellow notices - claiming they were ‘unsafe’.

Shocked owners of 488 graves at Worting Road Cemetery in Basingstoke, Hampshire, were warned they were liable if ‘anyone was injured’ by the gravestones.

They now face paying for repairs in one year or their memorials could be removed. Among those told their gravestone was unsafe is the family of David Ridgers, who has been buried there for 24 years.

His family believe a recent safety test made the grave unstable as the stones were ‘grabbed’ and ‘shaken’.

Local resident Claire Ridgers-Smith, 25, who was just two when her father passed away in 1990, was shocked and angry when she spotted the notice on a visit.

She said: ‘We visit dad constantly and his gravestone has always been in very good condition.

'The grave certainly wasn’t unstable before they checked it by grabbing it and shaking it. My mum was incredibly upset.’

The family appealed to Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, raising concerns the grave was damaged during the test, and the borough agreed to fund the repairs.

Around 10 per cent of the 4,822 graves tested at the cemetery, which has more than 10,000, failed memorial stability tests.

Notices: The owners now face paying for repairs in one year or their memorials could be taken down

The notice says: ‘Your memorial has been identified as being a potential risk to others as it has failed a memorial stability test.

‘As the owner of the grave, you are responsible for the repair and maintenance of the memorial and may be liable should an accident occur or if anyone is injured.

‘If no action is taken to repair this memorial within the next 12 months, the authority may lay the memorial down.’

Tim Boschi, head of community services at Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, said they had contacted families and advised them to repair the gravestones.

This was in the interests of ensuring the cemetery remains ‘safe’ for visitors and those who work there.

He said: ‘We are committed to ensuring the cemetery remains safe for all visitors and those who work there. We, therefore, have a periodic programme of memorial safety inspections.

‘The testing of the graves was carried out by an independent company that specialises in memorial safety and checks for stability without using excessive force.

'It is the grave owners’ responsibility to ensure their memorials are stable and in a good state of repair'

Tim Boschi, Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council

‘All those memorials found to be in an unstable condition have been temporarily supported in order to minimise the risk.

‘It is the grave owners’ responsibility to ensure their memorials are stable and in a good state of repair.

‘We are contacting families where memorials have been found to be unsafe, and are advising them to contact a monumental mason.

‘We appreciate the distress and upset that this might cause, but we need to take this approach so that the cemetery remains a safe place.’
