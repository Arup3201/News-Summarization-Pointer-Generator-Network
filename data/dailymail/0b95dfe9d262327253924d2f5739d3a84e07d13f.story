Arrest: Jennifer Richmond, 22, allegedly earned $500,000 in a year as a high-class escort

Two high-class escorts who made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year had so much cash that they stashed it under carpets, in air vents and at storage units, investigators have said.

Jennifer Helen Richmond, 22, has been arrested for racketeering for 
her alleged part in a prostitution ring in Orlando, Florida that she said earned her $500,000 one year.

Her friend Christina Lynn Davis, told Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation agents that the business brought her in as much as $80,000 a month - more money than she knew what to do with.

Davis and their suspected boss, Abdullah Hamid, have fled the area and have not been arrested.

The trio have been on the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation's radar for years, and now Richmond's arrest has revealed their life of cash, fast cars and luxury hotels, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Throughout their years-long investigation, the MBI identified 15 to 20 women who worked for Hamid over the past five to 
eight years at agencies including 'Platinum Companions' and 'Ashley's 
Playmates'.

The agency charged $300 to 
$400 for one hour, while a dinner date for up to five hours ranged from $1,500 to $1,800.

The group, which offered services in other areas including Washington D.C., advertized across adult websites and even on Facebook.

'We
 provide a high class private incall and outcall service for your 
discreet, passionate, and intimate encounter. We are your local source 
for companions,' one advertisement said.

'Our models are available for visiting your residence or hotel and a nice upscale incall is always available as well.'

MBI agents once found Davis,
 Richmond and Hamid at the Westgate Palace hotel in Orlando.

Hamid
 was driving a 2006 Bentley Continental around the parking lot that Davis later admitted was hers. Agents found Davis and Richmond were in a hotel room and both said Hamid was their boyfriend.

Davis allegedly admitted that she was involved in an upscale-prostitution business and gave her money 
to Hamid, who would stash it in storage units.

She allegedly said that they also hid $40,000
 under the carpet and in the air vents at their apartment.

Richmond told agents she made $20,000 to $40,000 a month and admitted she hid about $500,000, according to the MBI report. She allegedly said she earned $500,000 in one year.

Agents
 seized Davis' Bentley and some of the group's money, but they did not track down all of the cash.

According
 to the MBI report, after Richmond was found at the Westgate hotel, an agent asked her where the money was kept.

'I won't tell you,' she said. 'I don't have to answer that.'

Davis and Hamid have not been arrested and do not face any local charges, authorities said.

Richmond has been accused of racketeering, which could see her sent to prison for 30 years. She remains in the Orange County Jail.
