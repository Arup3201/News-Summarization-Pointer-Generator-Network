34-year-old Lisa Guit was horrified to be advised by a doctor that she would not get the treatment she needed on the NHS because it is a 'shambles'

When Lisa Guit was diagnosed with cervical cancer while working as a banker in Singapore, she flew home to Britain to receive the best care the NHS could provide. 

But, on arriving home, the 34-year-old was horrified to be told by her doctor that the health service was in a ‘shambles’, she would ‘probably die on the waiting list’ – and would be better off going back to Singapore to get treatment there.

She eventually did just that but now, five years after successful treatment overseas, remains ‘disgusted’ by what she was told.

She said: ‘He clearly had zero sympathy for the situation I was in. He may have been telling the truth but he was so callous about it, he took away any hope I had. 

‘Instead of offering treatment and talking about my options he said, “The NHS is a shambles. You’ll probably die on the waiting list.” I was in absolute shock.’

‘It is not the kind of thing someone with such a low chance of survival expects to hear.’

Miss Guit, from Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2008, shortly after arriving in Singapore, and initially began treatment there.

But when doctors began to operate they discovered the cancer had spread, and removed 14 lymph nodes from her groin and legs, as well as her ovaries. 

The fact the cancer had spread meant Miss Guit’s survival rate had dropped from 80 per cent to 30 per cent. She was told the treatment she would require next would be extremely expensive and was advised to come back home.

She said: ‘I knew straight away I couldn’t afford it. I paid a lot of National Insurance tax so expected a high level of care on the NHS.’

But upon visiting her local  doctor in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, she was left devastated by his response.

She said: ‘I was in a horrific state. I walked in fully confident he would get me treatment straight away. He looked at me but did not examine me.’

Miss Guit, who worked for RBS, took out loans of nearly £30,000 and sought treatment in Singapore. She received a clear smear test result six weeks later.

There have since been further complications, but she is approaching the five-year cancer-free mark. She said: ‘It’s disgusting that I should have to fly across the world for treatment when I’ve worked in Scotland for most of my life. 

‘The NHS needs to do something because they’re playing with lives.’

A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ‘In 2008 NHS GGC maintained a strong performance on cancer waiting times and over 92 per cent of patients were seen within the waiting times guarantee.

‘NHS care in Greater Glasgow and Clyde is available to all those who need it. We are surprised to learn of the conversation between an independent GP and a patient.’
