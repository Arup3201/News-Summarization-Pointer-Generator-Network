Cameras captured the dramatic moment a fan fell from the top deck of the Ralph Wilson Stadium in New York on Sunday after apparently attempting to slide down the railing.

The unidentified Buffalo Bills fan plummeted from the third deck and landed on another spectator below, sending the unlucky man to hospital with a head injury.

The man who fell sustained a shoulder injury and both were carted off to hospital, the Associated Press reported.

CBS had filmed the incident at the game between the Bills and the New York Jets and inadvertently broadcasted it in some areas.

Horror: A fan can be seen apparently sliding down the railings of the third deck of the Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday - before losing his balance and tipping backwards, plummeting to the level below

Plunge: The unidentified man is pictured falling backwards, headed to the deck beneath

It shows how the man apparently attempted to slide down the railings on the third deck of the stadium before losing his balance and flailing backwards as other spectators in his section jumped to their feet.

He is seen falling backwards and plunging to the seats below, landing on another fan.

Spectator Jeff Savidge tweeted: 'He landed 5 feet from me. Right across the row. He acted like nothing happened while the guy he fell on was hurt bad.'

Another fan, who tweeted a picture of the man being wheeled away with a brace on his neck, added: 'The guy landed about 4 rows behind me... I heard a thud and then screams.'

He added that the victim he fell on looked around 17 years old and was taken off on a stretcher.

The incident sparked a commotion, with fans seated across the lower section standing and running to the injured man.

The Rural Metro ambulance report noted that both men were taken to a Buffalo hospital but that the injuries were not life threatening. It added that it could not revel the names of the two men involved.

The accident occurred during the second quarter of Buffalo's 37-14 win. There were windy conditions at the time the man tried to slide down the rail.

In confirming the accident, the Bills said both men were treated immediately and taken to hospital for observation.
