The best place for a life free from health worries has been revealed as the wealthy home counties around London, according to a new report.

The findings from the Office of National Statistics also reveal a stark north, south divide with disabled people living in the north finding they are more constrained in their daily lives than those living in the wealthier south east.

The report shows that, for example, people living in the more deprived north west of England were three times more likely be negatively impacted by disabilities or health issues.

The percentage of residents with day-to-day activities 'limited a lot' was strongly related to the level of deprivation experienced by the authorities, the report warned

Meanwhile just one in 20 people living in the affluent counties of Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire claimed they were hampered by health issues in their day-to-day lives, according to the ONS.

Elmbridge in Surrey is home to the fewest number of people whose lives are confined by illness or disability - where just 4.9 per cent of the population describe themselves as 'limited a lot', the ONS said.

In comparison, around 16 per cent of residents in Knowsley, Merseyside, described themselves as 'limited a lot' in carrying out normal day-to-day activities.

The figures echo another set of statistics exploring live expectancy across the country.

It showed that residents of wealthy southern counties could expect to remain well and active for as much as 18 years longer than people in England’s poorest boroughs.

Exclusive Elmbridge, dubbed ‘Britain’s Beverley Hills’ has claimed the title of the best place to live for a good quality of life on four separate occasions in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010.

The report states: 'There is significant inequality across local authorities in England with almost three times as many people in Knowsley, Merseyside, reporting that their activities were 'limited a lot' compared to Elmbridge, Surrey.

'The percentage of residents with day-to-day activities 'limited a lot' was strongly related to the level of deprivation experienced by the authorities' residents.

'The 10 authorities with the lowest rates were the same authorities for males and females.

'These authorities were among the least deprived in England, located in the commuter belts of Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and Surrey and having extensive rural and semi-rural populations.'

The ONS also noted significant variations across Wales.

Across England and Wales, 9.6 million people reported their day-to-day activities were limited in some way because of a health problem or disability

In Monmouthshire, 9 per cent of the population describe themselves as 'limited a lot' compares to 17 per cent who live in Merthyr Tydfil.

Overall, 12 per cent of residents of Wales reported their day-to-day activities as 'limited a lot' compared to less than 9 per cent of people in England.

In total around a fifth of the population of England and Wales -  9.6 million people - reported their day-to-day activities were limited in some way by issues relating to their health.

But less than half of these, just 46 per cent, described themselves as 'limited a lot.'

The report, collated from 2011 Census data, states that most people will experience some sort of illness or impairment at some point in their lives.

While some people's day-to-day activities such as socialising, going to work and living independently will not be affected, other impairments restrict activities such as employment, accessing services independently, and performing self-care tasks.

The report also found health problems 
were far more common among younger people in more deprived parts of the 
country and said the findings could suggest variations in access to 
effective health care in different areas.
