During the dreary winter months, many of us long for lighter evenings and sun rays hitting our windows.

Now there's a solution - albeit an expensive one - that creates the illusion of summer in any room of the house at any time of year.

Designed by Italian CoeLux, the £40,000 ($61,000) artificial skylight mimics the appearance of the sun and sky using a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.

CoeLux’s artificial skylight (pictured) mimics the visual appearance of the sun and sky using a solid layer of nanoparticles that produce Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering is what causes the sky to appear blue, for example, and when blue light wavelengths travel through the atmosphere they are scattered

CoeLux was set up by researchers from the University of Insubria, in Italy.

Each artificial skylight is fitted with a solid layer of nanoparticles that causes light to scatter.

The layer also creates an illusion of depth to make the 'sun' appear to be far away.

It can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the Tropics, Mediterranean and northern Europe.

CoeLux 60 produces 'cooler vertical' rays with the 'maximum luminance contrast of light and shadow,' as seen in tropical regions.

The Mediterranean-based CoeLux 45 skylight features a 45-degree ceiling beam that offers an equal balance of light and shade.

While CoeLux 30 uses a 30-degree angle beam relative to the horizon to reproduce 'a warm, Nordic grazing light.'

Known as Rayleigh scattering, this is what causes the sky to appear blue, for example.

When blue light wavelengths travel through the atmosphere they are scattered by other particles to give the sky its hue.

CoeLux’s technology uses a similar principle to force light from a standard bulb to scatter in the same way. 

And it can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the Tropics, Mediterranean and northern Europe.

The layer inside each aritificial skylight also creates an illusion of depth to make the 'sun' appear to be far away.

Rayleigh scattering occurs when light is scattered in different directions by small particles, typically smaller than the wavelength of the light being scattered.

The phenomenon is commonly seen in gases, but can also apply to solids and liquids.

Rayleigh scattering is what causes the sky to appear blue. When sunlight travels through the atmosphere it is scattered by other particles.

Blue light is scattered more efficiently than other wavelengths of light which causes the sky to look blue the majority of the time.

During sunrise and sunset, the sky appears red and orange because the sun’s rays are passing directly through the atmosphere and red light isn’t scattered as much, so passes through the atmosphere unaffected.

‘CoeLux is an optical system based on nano technology to artificially reproduce the natural light and visual appearance of the sun and sky,' said the company.

‘[It] offers a breakthrough opportunity for indoor architecture by creating the sensation of infinite space.

The firm added that CoeLux is ideal for airports, offices, gyms and museums as well as underground networks and parking garages.

In addition to £40,000 ($61,000) for the technology, installation costs £5,000 ($7,600) and requires at least 3.3ft (one metre) of ceiling recess for it to fit in.

CoeLux is hoping that the technology could also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and other conditions. 

Chief executive and Associate Professor of Optics and Experimental Physics, Paolo Di Trapani said: 'Besides SAD, we see plenty of possible applications of CoeLux in hospitals.'

'Naturally, CoeLux is foreseen to improve the quality of the overall treatment, with respect to comfort and [relaxation], with benefit both for the patient and the hospital.'
