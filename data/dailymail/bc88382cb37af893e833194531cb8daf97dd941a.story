The mother of an 18-month-old girl found dead inside a car with her sister was previously accused of neglecting her children by drinking while they were left in a playpen, it was claimed yesterday.

Christina Carlson, 36, was arrested last month after her daughter Chantel Craig, was found dead inside a car with her two-year-old sister on the Tulalip Indian Reservation in Washington state.

Carlson pleaded not guilty to criminal endangerment and failure to care for children, after the toddler was pronounced dead. The girl’s sister was treated for dehydration but is expected to recover.

Covered: Christina Carlson made her first court appearance over the case at Tulalip Tribal Court last month

But a Child Protective Services file apparently revealed a maternal grandmother had previously claimed Carlson gave the girls only a bottle without any solid food, reported KOMO News in Seattle.

She also claimed in December 2011 that Chantel’s sister had lice and couldn’t walk because she was always left in a walker. A CPS file allegedly said Carlson would leave her girls in a playpen and drink.

CPS case workers could not find Carlson in that month - but by January she agreed to treatment, along with the children’s father. A CPS visit in February then found the children and the home clean.

However a case worker found nobody home when making an unplanned visit in May. The home was boarded up by July and the case was closed in September for an unknown reason, reported KOMO.

Then last month the sisters were found alone in a car. Chantel was unconscious and unresponsive and was later pronounced dead at hospital. The CPS review board is now set to look at the case file.

The children were found on October 8. Chantel was taken to Providence Medical Center in Everett and her sister went to Seattle Children's Hospital, where she was treated for dehydration.

Carlson is in jail awaiting a trial which is expected to begin early next month, reported HeraldNet. She made her first court appearance, covered by a red sheet, at Tulalip Tribal Court on October 11.

Tulalip Tribe chairman Mel Sheldon told KOMO the girls’ family were part of the tribe - a close-knit Native American community living on the Tulalip Indian Reservation, 45 miles north of Seattle.
