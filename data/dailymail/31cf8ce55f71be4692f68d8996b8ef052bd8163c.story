The lawyer and accountant for reclusive mining heiress Huguette Clark have both lost out on an $8million payday each after a judge suspended them from handling her $400 million estate.

Attorney Wallace Bock and accountant Irving Kamsler committed ‘shocking’ tax fraud which meant Miss Clark, who died aged 104 in May, had an IRS bill of $90million, ruled Judge Kristin Booth Glen.

The duo are being probed criminally over the Montana heiress’s unpaid federal gift taxes and penalties, a court in Manhattan, New York, heard. Investigators warn this is the ‘tip of the iceberg’.

Reclusive: Huguette Clark, who died aged 104 in May, was a U.S. senator's daughter who owned the largest residence on Fifth Avenue in New York City - and mansions in California and Connecticut

Mr Kamsler said he planned to resign on Tuesday but has not done so yet. The duo are beginning to tell conflicting stories about the handling of the last 15 years of Miss Clark’s life, reported MNSBC.

A remaining estate official said he is trying to get back the gift of a $5million cheque to Miss Clark's registered nurse, Hadassah Peri, which Mr Bock allegedly had no authority to give her.

This was part of a $26million gift given to the nurse even before she left her more than $30million in her will. Neither Mr Bock nor Mr Kamsler have been charged with doing anything illegal.

But now the estate will be managed only by public administrator lawyers who alleged the fraud earlier this week. Judge Glen slammed the duo for wasting money and called them ‘unfit to serve’.

Mr Bock and Mr Kamsler allegedly did not file federal gift tax returns for Miss Clark from 1997 to 2003 when she gave gifts worth $56million, reported MSNBC. The taxes would have been $41.5million.

The duo also made her pay for tax returns that were not filed and did not tell her about unpaid taxes or possible penalties even though she could have afforded them, the court heard.

They were also said to have lied to the IRS and the public administrator and submitted tax returns which they knew were fraudulent.

This raises the possibility of criminal charges being brought.

Mr Kamsler, 64, of the Bronx, New York, is a registered sex offender who tried to distribute ‘indecent materials’ to teenage girls in an AOL chat room. Mr Bock, 79, is from Queens, New York.

For sale: Le Beau Château, in wealthy New Canaan, Connecticut, is only an hour from New York City but Miss Clark had never visited the property

Windfall: Hadassah Peri received a staggering multi-million payment from Miss Clark when she died

The duo were paid thousands of dollars a month for responsibilities that included dealing with the heiress's taxes.

But earlier this week they denied doing anything wrong over Miss Clark’s affairs.

‘Their entire, decades-long handling of her affairs was an ongoing effort to protect and preserve her chosen lifestyle and on her explicit instructions,’ said lawyer John Dadakis, representing the duo.

Miss Clark was a U.S. senator's daughter who owned the largest residence on Fifth Avenue in New York City - and mansions in California and Connecticut - but chose to live for decades in hospitals.

It emerged last month that Miss Clark had signed two wills within six weeks in 2005 - the first leaving most of her estate to great-nephews and great-nieces.

The second benefitted mainly her nurse and charity, creating an arts foundation that Mr Bock and Mr Kamsler would oversee and leaving them each $500,000.

Her father, Senator William A. Clark, built one of America's biggest fortunes of its day mining copper, building railroads and founding Las Vegas, Nevada.

Born in Paris to the 67-year-old U.S. senator and a 28-year-old Michigan woman, Miss Clark was married briefly in her 20s to a bank clerk. They parted after only nine months. She died childless.

After her mother's death, Miss Clark's once lively life amid New York's cultured world became more solitary, and she rarely ventured from her home. She moved into a hospital in the 1980s.
