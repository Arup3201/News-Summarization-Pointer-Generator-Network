A team of skydivers have taken their extreme hobby to the next level by setting off fireworks as they leap from their plane, thousands of feet above the ground.

The latest craze in extreme sports, pyrotechnic skydiving sees the team of four divers activate sets of fireworks strapped to their legs as they fall through the air at speeds of up to 120mph.

Professional skydiving team Fastrax, based in Ohio, USA, have long wowed audiences with their ambitious stunts but their latest effort boasts the added danger of fireworks attached to the divers' ankles.

Sparks will fly: A team of skydivers have taken their extreme hobby to the next level by setting off fireworks as they leap from their plane, thousands of feet above the ground

Latest craze: Pyrotechnic skydiving sees the team of four divers activate sets of fireworks strapped to their legs as they fall through the air at speeds of up to 120mph

After jumping at 13,500ft the divers press one of six buttons on their chest which sends an electrical impulse to trigger the fireworks.

The explosives burn at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the equivalent of 100,000 candles, for about 45 seconds each while the team members hang onto each other's arms in free fall.

When they get to 5,000ft the team have to carefully release their parachutes while avoiding the flames, which can shoot up to 800ft in the air, before lighting another set of fireworks.

The result is an incredible light show illuminating the night sky.Â 

Performers: The team has performed in movies and commercial, and regularly undertake stunts for television shows, as well as entertaining crowds at sporting events and air shows

However, the team risk setting their own parachutes alight as well as the risks involved with jumping at night.

'It's pretty cool how we can actually create firework shows as we jump,' said team leader John Hart.

'It looks meteor when we're falling through the sky with flames flying behind us.

'It's just a long trail of fire.

'Other people do it with theatrical pyrotechnics but it's not genuine - they're small and there's no risk involved.

Burn out: Team leader John Hart said divers can find it difficult to adjust their eyes when the fireworks have gone out

'When we exit the aircraft you feel a lot of energy - it's pitch black apart from our electronic lights that we use to find each other.

'I haven't been on one that hasn't got my heart racing because it can be dangerous.

'The temperature goes up by six degrees just from the heat of the pyrotechnics and it is easy to be disorientated once the pyrotechnics have gone out.

'Your eyes haven't adjusted but you still have to identify your landing location in the dark.

'But it won't stop me because it's such a beautiful thing to be part of.'

Mr Hart said the team, which formed in 2002, came up with the idea of adding fireworks to their daredevil routines to help them stand out from other display teams.

Top performer: To even be considered for a part in the pyrotechnic team, divers must have completed 2,000 jumps

Light show: The team travel around the world performing at a number special events, and members believe their fireworks set them apart from other display teams

'It all started when we were thinking about what could set us apart as a skydiving team,' he said.

'And we thought "Let's set ourselves on fire!"

'Now we travel around the world performing at special events where people are hoping to give a presentation or a fireworks display that extra spark.

'We've been to Malaysia, the UAE, Russia and Japan and all over the USA.

'Although we've got 30 people on the ordinary skydiving team there are just ten of us that do pyrotechnics.

'You need excellent freefall skills and stability. Being picked for the pyro team is the pinnacle of skydiving.

Team members: Mr Hart, pictured second from left, said although 30 people were part of the Fastrax ordinary skydiving team, just ten performed with pyrotechnics

Equipment: Mr Hart demonstrates the firework sticks strapped to his ankle. They are controlled via buttons attached to his chest

'You have to do 2,000 jumps before you are even considered - it's no mean feat.'

Photographer Norman Kent joins the team on their jumps to capture the moments the fireworks light up the sky on film.

He said: 'It's a very delicate thing because you're basically jumping out of a plane with live explosives.

'I've worked on films like Godzilla and Enders Game filming aerial stunts but watching the Fastrax team skydive with fireworks is something else.

Mystery: According to team members some of their night time displays have been followed by calls from members of the public mistaking the display team for UFOs

'They have to perform the dive perfectly otherwise they're at risk of burning themselves.

'A small error means it could end very differently but it's a really spectacular thing.

'It's difficult to get close to take pictures while avoiding being burnt.

'I have a special suit which means I have great mobility as I freefall. It's really like flying.'

Brave: Photographer Norman Kent joins the team on their jumps to capture the moments the fireworks light up the sky on film, and says the team must perform the dive perfectly to avoid any risk of being burnt

Meteoric: Mr Hart said the divers create firework shows as they jump, and resemble a meteor when they are falling through the sky with flames flying behind them
