A violinist discovered that two elephants in Wisconsin can be counted among her fanbase.

'I decided to go outside and play a bit for Kelly and Viola, 44 and 45 year-old elephants that have lived together for most of their lives,' violinist Eleanor Bartsch wrote in a YouTube video description. 'I found out that elephants REALLY like Bach...'

The duo were filmed raising their tusks and slowly bopping as Bartsch performed, AOL pointed out.

Private concert: Elephants Kelly and Viola 'dance' as Eleanor Bartsch plays violin

The incident took place at Baraboo's Circus World Museum

Bartsch wrote the incident was a '[warm-up for her] performance of the Bach Concerto for Two Violins with the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra at the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, WI,' the news site noted. 

Elephants have been seen 'dancing' next to musical performers before.

Last year, Paul Barton uploaded a video of himself playing the piano - as Thai 'Peter the Elephant' tapped his trunk on the keys with him.

A group of elephants were also filmed last year performing a routine in which they flipped their tails and completed tricks with trainers, set to 'Gangnam Style.'
