London has been crowned the most attractive city in the world for the first time, knocking New York off the top spot.

The French capital, which battles with its rival across the Channel to attract capital and tourists, dropped two places overall.

Number one: London has been crowned the most attractive city in the world

Second place: New York fell from the top spot to number two for the first time

London meanwhile climbed two places to knock New York from the number one position.

The two cities are also moving in opposite directions in the narrower category of economic power - two notches up for London, two down for Paris, according to the annual survey.

The ranking is based on studies by the International Monetary Fund and other international groups as well as a survey of PwC staff.

New York was ranked as the world's second most attractive city and Singapore came in third, followed by Toronto and San Francisco.

Paris came in first in terms of 'intellectual capital and innovation'.

Australia's most populated city did out rank overall winner London, when it came to demographics and liveability. Sydney came in first by a small margin in this quality-of-life section which rounds up the survey.
