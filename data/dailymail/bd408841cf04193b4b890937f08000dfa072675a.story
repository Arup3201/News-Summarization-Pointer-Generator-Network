Dao Nguyen, 44, who was being investigated for allegedly defrauding members of a California temple out of tens of thousands of dollars was found dead Friday in an apparent suicide

A Buddhist monk who was being investigated for allegedly defrauding members of a California temple out of tens of thousands of dollars was found dead Friday in an apparent suicide.

Dao Nguyen, 44, was discovered unresponsive at Tu Nghiem Temple in Santa Ana at 9.15am, according to police.

Nguyen's death by hanging comes more than three weeks after police were called to the temple on West Fourth Street in response to an angry crowd of people demanding that he return close to $100,000 he had collected from them.

The monk allegedly had told congregants the money would be used towards a trip to Vietnam that never took place.

Santa Ana police said Nguyen raised anywhere between $1,100 and $7,700 from 34 people, allegedly pocketing a total of $97,000 for himself.

The members of the temple community expected to fly out to Vietnam March 2 and tour the country's Buddhist landmarks.

But on March 1, they found out about the scam and converged on the Tu Nghiem Temple in the Little Saigon part of Santa Ana at around 11am, calling on Nguyen to give them their money back, reported the Los Angeles Times.

When confronted with the allegations of fraud, Dao Nguyen claimed that the plane tickets and travel documents, including passports, had been destroyed in a fire that broke out at the temple February 28; but police later determined that that monk never booked any tickets.

The 44-year-old Nguyen, who spoke no English, then changed his story, telling investigators that he did receive plane tickets, but they were fake. He claimed that his agent in Vietnam was supposed to make all the necessary travel arrangements for the planned pilgrimage.

He then blamed the deception on an unnamed person who delivered them to his apartment at the Santa Ana sanctuary just hours before the fire. 

The blaze inside the one-story temple, which was founded six years ago, has been ruled suspicious, according to officials.

Santa Ana police will be reviewing bank records, emails and phone call logs to determine if other people were involved in the fraud.

Nguyen's death left his small congregation divided, with some accusing him of being a swindler while others, like Truc Tam, praising him as a kind-hearted person who was always eager to help those in need.
