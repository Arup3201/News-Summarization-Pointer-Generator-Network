The weather phenomenon dubbed the Siberian Express caused record-breaking low temperatures in almost every single area in the central and eastern US on Friday, with all major cities reporting record lows for this date and many reporting record lows for the month of February.

The temperature dropped to a 60-year-low of 1F in New York City Friday morning, caused fruit crops to freeze in Florida, and in Embarrass, Minnesota, it got all the way down to -41F on Thursday.

In New York City, temperatures were so cold that normally popular tourist destinations such as Central Park and Fifth Avenue were virtually empty, with residents and those visiting the city choosing to stay indoors.
