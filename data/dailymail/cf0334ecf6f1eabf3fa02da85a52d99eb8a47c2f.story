When Paul Williamson got back together with his former college sweetheart last May after 30 years apart - his story had all the makings of a fairytale.

But the concert pianist's joy was snatched away just months after rekindling the relationship - when he was given the devastating news that he had terminal cancer.

After hearing his prognosis last August, Mr Williamson, 48, made it his mission to marry Anne Hope before he died and yesterday the couple wed in an emotional Valentine's Day ceremony in the West Midlands.

They first dated when both were 18-year-old students at the old Coventry School of Music. 

But their two-year relationship fizzled out when talented Mr Williamson moved away after winning a place at Birmingham Conservatoire.

Three decades later, Ms Hope, also 48, spotted Mr Williamson's name on a directory of music teachers and the pair decided to meet up - soon picking up where they left off.  

Yesterday they tied the knot at Elmdon Church in Solihull in a service organised in just a fortnight.

The venue was particularly poignant as it was where Mr Williamson's parents were married 56 years earlier.

He bravely made his vows despite  struggling to speak as a result of his mouth and throat cancer.

His sister Lynda Crabb said: 'I understood every word he said. It was wonderful.'

Describing the couple's decision to marry, she previously said: 'Both Paul and Anne were very emotional. I was with Anne and she got upset and said that all she wanted to do was marry Paul.

'When I took Paul to the doctors, he got emotional and said that he wanted to marry Anne too. We just take everything one day at a time. 

'He never gives up. He's full of spirit. He still plays the piano and can drag me around and then out to the pub. Anne is so good with Paul. She cares for him so much.'

The venue was particularly poignant as it was where Mr Williamson's parents were married 56 years earlier 

The ceremony began at 1.30pm with the bride, wearing a white dress with red and diamanté detailing, arriving at the church in a cream Beauford Open Top Tourer. 

Mr Williamson wore a tailored suit from the Suit Lounge in Coventry - provided after his family had struggled to find one that fitted him as his cancer has caused his weight to plummet to just eight stone.

Ms Hope was walked down the aisle by John, Mr Williamson's father - with the groom's twin brother David acting as best man.

The theme of the service, conducted by the Rev Toby Crowe, was a line taken from The Beatles' hit All You Need is Love. 

During the ceremony, the vicar said: 'All you need is love. Who better is there to give that message to the world than you?'

The bride and groom held hands throughout the readings, given by friends and family, including Ms Hope's teenage daughter Ellie.

When Mr Williamson felt tired his bride was seen supporting him by wrapping her arm protectively around his waist.

As they signed the wedding register, two flautists performed Brian Adams hit Everything I Do and Take That's Rule the World.

As they left the church, the newly-married couple released  two white doves into the sky.
