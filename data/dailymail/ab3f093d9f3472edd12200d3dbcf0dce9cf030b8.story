Flights to and from Darwin are expected to resume on Sunday afternoon with volcanic plume and ash clouds expected to clear.

Despite Indonesia's Sangeang Api volcano currently erupting  continuously, the plume is being released at a much lower level, according to a spokesperson from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin.

The ash is also not reaching as high in the atmosphere as residue from the first explosive eruption.

'The higher level of ash over Australia is dissipating and won't be there much beyond this afternoon,' the spokesperson told MailOnline.

Darwin Airport spokeswoman Virginia Sanders has also told the ABC that despite flights remaining grounded on Sunday morning, they are likely to resume later in the day as airlines continue to receive advice from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre.

'Today it looks as though we will have some flights come back online, some more Jetstar flights, Qantas will be meeting this morning to find out when their lunchtime flights will come online, and Air North will be operating some flights as well,' she said.

The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes. The Sunda Islands sit inside Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire'. Since Sangiang Api's first recorded eruption in 1512, it is believed to have erupted a total of 20 times

Qantas has also confirmed that their first flight to Darwin will be landing in the Northern Territory’s capital city at about 1pm on Sunday.

The airline issued a brief release which stated: 'All Qantas and Jetstar services in and out of Darwin have resumed today following the eruption of a volcano on the southern Indonesian island of Sangeang. All operations are due to operate as scheduled'.

Virgin Australia has also issued a statement saying they expect flights to resume by Sunday afternoon.

'Based on the latest advice we have received and with the forecast expected to clear in affected areas near Darwin and Denpasar, we will resume operations into and out of Darwin later this afternoon. We will also resume operations into and out of Denpasar,' a statement from the airline said.

Emile Jansons, manager of the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, said plumes posed no threat to the health of people on the ground and wouldn't even be noticed by the naked eye.

'When you're as far away as Darwin is it's really not noticeable for people,' Mr Jansons said.

'There's no ash falling on the ground, there's no smell of sulphur as the ash is quite high up in the atmosphere. So visibly it looks no different to the standard dry seasons we have here which is a little bit of bushfire smoke and a bit of haze in the air.'

The 20km-high ash cloud from the volcanic eruption played havoc with Australia's flight paths on Friday.

Australians heading to the popular holiday location of Bali found themselves stranded when their flights were cancelled due to the island's airspace being disrupted by volcanic plume.

Darwin was also cut off to all air services and thousands of people were left stranded in the city after the ash cloud blew over the Northern Territory coast line, forcing the airport to close.

On Saturday night, all flights from Melbourne to Bali were cancelled, reported The Age.

Planes at East Kimberley Regional Airport in West Australia were also grounded due to the plumes.

Each shape on the map indicates various levels of ash cloud hanging over areas measured from the surface to flight level (SFC). The lowest ash cloud at 10,000 feet, can be seen to the west of the volcano. The highest cloud above Northern Australia at 20,000-45,000 feet, can only be seen in the first box as the cloud begins to clear

The volcano, Sangeang Api, in Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Island is currently continuously erupting since the first eruption on Friday afternoon.

The first ash cloud, between 20,000 and 50,000 feet high and up to 15km wide, moved in a south-easterly direction over central Australia on Saturday night at about 100 knots before scattering quickly.

A second cloud at about 45,000 feet was over Darwin and moving east at about 60 knots, while the third ash cloud, north-east of Bali, avoided Australian airspace.

On Saturday morning at least 18 flights were cancelled coming in and out of the airport, The Australian reported.

Domestic and international flights run by Virgin, Jetstar, Qantas, Emirates, Malaysia, SilkAir and Airnorth airlines were abandoned.

A Jetstar spokesman confirmed 530 passengers were affected by the cancellations.

Once moving off the coast, the ash cloud moved south towards Alice Springs and sat between 6km and 13km above the ground.

The Sangeang Api volcano is about 1400km away from Darwin and is currently continuously erupting but at a much lower level than the initial eruption

Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the issue with flying near or through the cloud was not just visibility, but the effect it had on the plane.

He said silica contained in the cloud could cause extensive damage to a jet.

'The damage it can do to the aircraft can be abrasive,' Mr Gibson said.

'It can melt and stick to the engine.'

The Bureau of Meteorology continues to monitor the situation.

After erupting, the volcano sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air. Pilots in the area reported seeing the cloud rise 20km high, spreading over a 40km area

The volcano sits in Indonesia's notorious 'Ring of Fire' - an area where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. It has 452 volcanoes - 75 per cent of the world's total

The incredible moment Indonesia's huge volcano erupted, sending ash spewing an estimated 20 kilometres into the sky, was captured in pictures.

The powerful explosion took place at Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands - an area that plays host to 129 active volcanoes - and sent a distinctive spaceship-shaped ring of pyroclastic smoke high into the air.

The photographs were taken by professional photographer Sofyan Efendi during a commercial flight from Bali to the fishing town of Labuan Bajo in West Nusa Tenggara province.

Scores of farmers who work but do not live on the Indonesian island were ordered to leave and not return until the volcano has finished erupting, said Muhammad Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's National Volcanology Agency. There are not believed to have been any deaths or injuries as a result of the eruption.

Authorities have had Mount Sangiang Api on high alert for almost a year, he told China's Xinhua news agency.
