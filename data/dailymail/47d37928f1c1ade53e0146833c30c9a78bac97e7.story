Diego Costa says he does not want to get caught up in a 'club vs country war' but has declared himself fit for Spain.

Jose Mourinho has stated that Costa is struggling to play so many games amid concerns over his hamstring injuries.

Brazil-born Costa pulled out of their most recent qualifier against Macedonia with a hamstring problem.

Mourinho, who has continued to play his £32m summer signing despite the long-running injury issue, suggested last week that Costa needed to use the next international break to recover properly.

But the striker has said he is fit and wants to be named in Spain's squad for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg.

'I hope I am okay to go with Spain,' Costa told Marca after completing Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League Group G win at Sporting Lisbon. 'If I played 90 minutes it is clear that I am fine, I am feeling better all the time, and it is the boss's [Vicente Del Bosque's] decision.'

The Blues forward has scored eight goals in six Premier League games 

Asked after whether he feared a 'war' could break out between Mourinho and Spain coach Del Bosque, the Brazil-born player said: 'I do not believe that could happen. I have already had enough with the issue about Brazil. Now I must stay relaxed to be able to work and do things well, with the national team too.'

Despite declaring his fitness, Costa admitted he has needed special training to enable him to overcome his hamstring problem, which hampered him regularly through the final stages of last season when he was at Atletico Madrid.

'During the week I am working in an intensive way with the physios, because I have some issues from a while back,' he said.
