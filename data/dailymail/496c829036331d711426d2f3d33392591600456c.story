Wayne Rooney has been starving for goals in 2015, but the Manchester United captain showed a hunger of a different kind on Thursday night.

The 29-year-old was seen out on a dinner date with his wife Coleen as they ate out at their favourite restaurant Wing's Chinese.

Wing's Restaurant is a popular haunt for Rooney, who has held his last two birthday celebrations there, and over the past few weeks has been helping the venue get some publicity after starring in an educational video in the build up to Chinese New Year earlier this month.

Rooney took part in a recent Q and A session at the restaurant with fans about playing for  United

The fans were keen to know who are the best players that Rooney has played with among other things

The striker also posed with the restaurant's golden dragon mascot, tried his hand at paper cutting and lion dancing, before chatting to fans about his career in a recent Q and A session with some fans during a recent promotional campaign for establishment.

Rooney has only netted just once in 10 games since the turn of the year  - as Louis van Gaal's side have struggled in the final third recently.

The Red Devils skipper has been largely used in midfield by Van Gaal this season, but he was deployed up front in their 2-1 defeat away at Swansea on February 21.

Defeat for the OId Trafford outfit  was compounded by the fact that they were overtaken by Arsenal into third place in the Premier League too.

Van Gaal and Rooney will be looking to get United's Champions League ambitions back on track when they host Sunderland at home on Saturday afternoon.
