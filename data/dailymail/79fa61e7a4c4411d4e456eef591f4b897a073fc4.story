A bewildered seal forages to survive far from coastal waters.

It’s an irresistibly adorable sight that has captured the hearts of animal-lovers ever since ‘Keith’ was first spotted having strayed inland.

Adorable, that is, except for anglers who claim the seal is a threat to other fish and wildlife – and want to see it shot.

All at sea: Keith the female seal is said to be confused after losing her way and swimming up the River Severn

But now Keith’s followers are fighting back to keep the seal safe with a Facebook campaign and online petition.

Keith, who despite the name is 
believed to be female, was first spotted in the River Severn in 
November, after it had strayed more than 50 miles from its usual marine 
habitat.

Since then animal-lovers have followed
its journey and reports of sightings. But after Keith was snapped 
eating a duck and numerous fish, the Angling Trust labelled it a ‘marine
predator’ and threatened to obtain a licence and use a qualified 
marksman to shoot the mammal.

Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the 
Trust, said: ‘This marine predator cannot be allowed to carry on eating 
its way through freshwater fish that have taken decades to grow to a 
size.

'We will try everything possible to remove it humanely but more 
drastic action may be the only option if these methods do not work.’

Enjoying herself: Keith seems in no hurry to leave

One
angling club member even claimed Keith was a threat to pets. Stuart 
Anderson said: ‘I am very worried as it has started taking ducks and 
waterfowl and soon will start attacking swans and maybe dogs swimming.’

But within hours of the shooting threat emerging a Facebook campaign entitled ‘Save Keith the Seal’ was launched.

By last night it had already been endorsed with more than 600 ‘likes’.

Twitter was also buzzing with messages
backing Keith, while an online petition to save the seal from the 
bullet had amassed well over 400 signatures.

The seal was first photographed having swum upstream to Bewdley and Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire.

There locals nicknamed it after Colonel Keith, the Royalist commander at the 1651 Battle of Worcester during the Civil War.

The seal’s usual home is believed to 
be in the Irish Sea or Bristol Channel. Animal-lovers will be reassured 
by the response of the authorities, which suggests victory for the 
campaign to save Keith.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: 
‘We understand the concerns of anglers, but one animal in a large river 
like the Severn is unlikely to have a significant impact on fish stocks.

‘This is natural predation and it will eventually make its way back out to sea.

‘With this is mind, and because seals are a protected species, we won’t be taking action.’

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘It’s not uncommon for seals to venture away from the sea.

‘As long as the seal is not injured, or in any immediate danger, then we would not be concerned for its welfare.’
