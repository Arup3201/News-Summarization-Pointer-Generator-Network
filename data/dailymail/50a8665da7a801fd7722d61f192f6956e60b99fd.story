A mother-of-two who ballooned to 18st after she got hooked on takeaways has shed a third of her body weight for the sake of her children.

Natalie Fowkes, 25, was bullied as a teenager because of her size. And when she left home aged 18 she piled on another four stone due to a takeaway addiction that saw her spend £15,000 over three years on fast food.

At her heaviest Natalie weighed an unhealthy 18st, but falling pregnant was the motivation she needed to help turn around her life.

Natalie Fowkes lost almost six stone after ditching her takeaway habit and joining Slimming World

When Natalie from Langley Mill, Derbyshire, discovered she was pregnant aged 21 she decided it was time to do something about her weight.

Prompted by her own experiences of being called 'Fat Nat' by school bullies, Natalie joined Slimming World and eventually lost 6st to avoid her children being mocked about her appearance. 

Natalie, who now weighs 11st 9lb and is mother to Masie, 4, and Ollie, 15 months, said: 'I did not want the kids to say, "Look at the state of your mum,"

Natalie's love of takeaways saw her spend £15,000 on fast food in three years

Her weight ballooned after she left ho,me aged 18

'I know how cruel kids can be, so I wanted help.

'I was terrible for takeaways and loved chips, crisps and full-fat Coca-Cola.

'My diet was disgusting and I'd eat anything I could get my hands on.

'I loved food so much, it was an addiction.

'People with a drug addiction get all the help in the world but I didn't get that.

'Food was my comfort. I hated being fat and I used to think: "Why can't I just be thin?"' 

Now 11st 9lb Natalie now has so much more confidence she has even started her own Slimming World group to help other people lose weight

Natalie's diet consisted of fast food like McDonald's or Greggs for lunch followed by a pizza or kebab in the evening. 

Throughout high school Natalie was taunted with nicknames like 'beached Whale' and was constantly told she looked like a man.

The  mother-of-two said: 'I was always the biggest in the class so people called me fat.

'I was called names constantly and, at the time. When I was single, I'd go out into town and people would say I looked disgusting and like a man. It was horrible and I'd cry all the time.'

Natalie lost the weight using Slimming World programme after a friend recommended the company to her.

After battling her nerves to go to the first meeting four years ago, Natalie was delighted as the weight started to budge.

BREAKFAST: Three slices of white toast with chocolate spread, cup of tea, packet of biscuits

LUNCH: A McDonald's or Greggs super-sized cob with a full-fat cake

DINNER: Crispy chicken with a mountain of chips or a pizza or a kebab

BREAKFAST: Full English Slimming World breakfast with fruit and a yoghurt

LUNCH: Pasta or jacket potato 

DINNER: Meat dish with vegetables and potatoes

She continued with the programme after the birth of her second child, Ollie, in June 2013, losing 12st 5lb just five days after he was born.

She said: 'Slimming World has been my life. I can't begin to imagine what it would be like without it.

'I have so much more confidence. Four years ago, I would never have dreamed of showing off my legs.'

Natalie has now started her own Slimming World group, to help other people lose weight.

A Slimming World spokesperson says: 'Slimming World is the only national weight loss organisation that supports women to manage their weight through every stage of their pregnancy, from preconception to post-natally with the consent and on-going recommendation of their midwife or GP.

'Our pregnancy policy, developed in partnership with the Royal College of Midwives, ensures that mums-to-be and breastfeeding mothers get all the support they need to manage their weight by developing healthy eating habits and moderate activity routines when they attend a weekly group.'
