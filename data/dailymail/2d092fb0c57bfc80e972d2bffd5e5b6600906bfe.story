Glowing bride-to-be Kate Bosworth is bucking the Hollywood trend by embracing her age and admitting that she actually loves being out of her twenties.

In an exclusive interview with The Edit the 30-year-old, who got engaged to boyfriend Michael Polish in September, says that she is enjoying a more grown-up chapter of her life and career.

And the accompanying pictures show that the blonde has never seemed more confident or beautiful.

Kate who was shot by photographer Koray Birand for the net-a-porter feature said: 'I love being 30, 
because I’ve hit that moment when I can reflect on my life comfortably. What I’ve learned from Michael is that when we feel 
vulnerable, at least in an artistic situation, it can be a good thing.'

Seen wearing new season pieces by Lanvin, Miu Miu, Roksanda Ilincic, Dolce & Gabbana, Victoria Beckham, Gucci and Fendi, the striking star added: 'We’ve all experienced things that have brought us to where we need to 
be. I don’t have any doubts that the person I’m with is my life 
partner.

'Everything else I’ve experienced, it’s a part of my past. And 
that’s where it’s going to stay. Everybody’s moved on. I want to respect
their privacy, and mine.'

Kate and Michael met when he directed her in Big Sur in 2011, talking about falling in love she said: 'There are so many things that just clicked for us. It’s like, what 
didn’t draw us together? It feels as if we have known each other our 
whole lives, even though he is 12 years older than me. But it feels like
he’s been there every step of the way. And he is a great mentor to me, 
artistically.'

The couple plan to marry next year in a 'not the norm' ceremony 'involving whisky', and for fashion fan Kate the wedding dress reportedly designed by by Oscar de la Renta was a long-deliberated decision: 'There
was no doubt about the designer, [but] there was a feeling of, "Do I 
dance around the bridal thing and wear a dress I could wear for the red 
carpet?" But lately I’m all about coming out of my comfort zone and 
challenging myself, so I decided to embrace the moment.

'It has been a 
real discovery of that part of myself. I have never thought about it – 
the dress, the ring, any of it.'

Talking about her style she told The Edit: 'I don't like too many tricks or gimmicks. It's important for me to feel comfortable. It's as simple as that.'

California girl Kate is held up as a fashion icon by her armies of female fans, even designing a festival collection with British High Street brand Topshop this summer.

And she seems to be expanding her style horizons further as she also joined the panel of Lifetime's Project Runway for the series' season 12 premiere this summer.
