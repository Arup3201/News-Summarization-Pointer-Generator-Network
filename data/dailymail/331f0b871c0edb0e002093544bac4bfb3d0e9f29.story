A Burbank woman was held in a jail cell for 10 hours for painting her nails on an aeroplane.

Jeanie Daniels was on board a Southwest Airlines plane from Los Angeles to Houston, Texas on January 26, on her way to see her boyfriend when a flight attendant took offence to the smell of the varnish and asked her to put it away.

‘I said I’m sorry, I apologize and I put it away,’ Daniels told CBS Local. ‘About 10 minutes into the flight I discovered I only had two nails left to paint so I thought, well if I went to the bathroom and did it, it wouldn’t offend anyone.”

But when she left the bathroom she found another flight attendant lying in wait for her, angry that Daniels had gone ahead and continued to use the nail paint despite being told not to. 

The pair began to argue and it got heated, with Daniels swearing at the attendant. She told CBS that she told the attendant to ‘Stop bitching at me’.

Daniels added: ‘She was getting so loud when I was sitting in my seat. I was like, just stop, and I was loud because she wouldn’t end the conversation.’

As she stepped off the flight 1536 plane she was handcuffed by two police officers. They interviewed Daniels, the attendant and a witness and carted her off to a police station on a charge of using ‘abusive profane language’.

The charges were dropped by the DA, but not before Daniels spent 10 hours in jail.

Her boyfriend, Jimmy Hauser, said he was shocked when he was told what had happened. ‘They wouldn’t let her talk’, he added. ‘They said to her “don’t talk”.’

In a statement, Southwest Airlines said: ‘The Customer in question was taken into custody upon arrival in Houston for behaviour she displayed while onboard a flight from LAS – HOU on February 26.  

‘The airport police became involved because of the passenger’s behaviour and a verbal altercation with a Southwest Airlines crew member. Southwest Airlines is responsible for the safety of all of our passengers and Employees.’
