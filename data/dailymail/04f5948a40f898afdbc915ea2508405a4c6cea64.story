Debate: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has reignited the issue of Britain's foreign aid contributions with his infamous 'Bongo Bongo land' comments

David Cameron yesterday weighed into the row over an MEP’s ‘Bongo Bongo land’ comments by describing them as ‘offensive’ and ‘wrong’.

Despite Godfrey Bloom being rebuked for his outburst by UKIP party bosses, he again refused to apologise for the remarks.

The Prime Minister criticised Mr Bloom by describing Britain as a ‘very open, international country’.

‘I think it’s an offensive remark anyway, but I think that where he’s wrong is this sort of “stop the world I want to get off” approach – it just doesn’t work,’ he told the BBC’s Breakfast programme.

‘The problems elsewhere come and visit us so it makes sense to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve those problems at source.’

As the Prime Minister defended Britain’s international aid programme, one minister claimed that other members of the Government had been banned from commenting publicly on the issue.

‘We were told unequivocally not to criticise or get drawn into it’, the minister said. ‘We were told to just say it’s UKIP’s problem because we know when you strip away the “bongo bongo” comment, the public agree with him.

‘Our policy on international aid is unsaleable.’

Mr Bloom told supporters in the Midlands in July that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’.

The 63-year-old MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber is recorded saying: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we’re in this sort of debt to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’

Condemnation: The Prime Minster said Mr Bloom's comments were offensive and wrong

Yesterday, Mr Cameron said there was a ‘totally legitimate debate to be had about whether it’s right to keep our promises on overseas aid’.

He said Britain had promised ‘the poorest people in the world’ donations worth 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015 ‘to eradicate appalling diseases’.

As well as the moral case, he said ‘there’s actually a national self-interest that if we invest in these countries, for instance Somalia, we can stop the mass migration of more and more people turning up at our shores’.

Mr Bloom, appearing on ITV yesterday, said his comments were ‘not racist at all’ and bizarrely claimed that the word bongo meant a ‘white antelope that lives in the forest’. He said: ‘Bongo land is the land of the antelope.’

Bongo is a type of antelope found in central Africa, but it is in fact a red-brown colour.

Mr Bloom found support last night from Tory backbencher Philip Davies. ‘I wouldn’t have used those words but in terms of the substance of what he said, I don’t doubt the majority of the public would agree with him and I certainly do,’ he said.

‘Godfrey Bloom says he didn’t mean any offence so I’m happy to take his word on that.’
