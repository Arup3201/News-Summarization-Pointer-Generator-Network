And if the hustle and bustle on deck becomes too much, guests can retreat for a moment of peace to enjoy the eye-catching views of their surroundings from the viewing platform in the crow's nest.

Alex Clarke, director of Denison Super Yacht Division, said: 'The Columbus Global Explorer is a new construction project which we have been marketing with a 30 month delivery period thus the yacht will not be completed until 2016.

'This project has now been modified and improved upon so we will now be replacing the marketing with the M75 Global Explorer.

'The M75 Global Explorer is a modernised project of the Columbus Global Explorer and we have lengthened the current project to 75 metres - up from a previous 72 metres.'

The opulent ship is yet to be completed, and any lucky buyers will be able to alter current specifications - such as adding helipads, custom dive stations and even a submarine

But the privilege to individually tailor their own designs won't come cheap.

Alex added: 'The build time depends on the interior dicor and final technical specifications.

'Her hull can be strengthened to ice-class standards, carry numerous watersports toys including a submarine, custom dive station, jets skis, tenders, and sport fishing vessels if required.

'She can also be built to accommodate a large helicopter similar to an Augusta AW109 or Euro Copter EC155 in either a touch and go rating, or to carry one full time.

'This is an explorer style vessel with a full displacement steel hull and aluminium superstructure purposely built to travel to the far reaches of the world's oceans with every luxury amenity available for the most discerning owner.'
