Jermain Defoe is a step closer to securing his return to the Barclays Premier League after agreeing a move to Sunderland - and has arrived in the city in order to finalise the deal.

As revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, the 32-year-old striker is poised to end his 11-month spell with Toronto FC in Major League Soccer and join Gus Poyet’s side. 

Sunderland sit just one point and two places above the relegation zone after managing only 18 league goals so far this season, but Defoe is expected to be confirmed as a Black Cats played on Thursday after arriving in the North East in order to rubber stamp the deal.

Sunderland have arranged a swap deal that involves Black Cats misfit Jozy Altidore heading in the opposite direction.

The USA international’s big wages were a concern but it's understood the 25-year-old has agreed terms with Toronto FC as Defoe has sorted his deal with Sunderland.

Defoe meanwhile has scored 11 goals in 16 games in the MLS, but has been keen to return home and revive his Premier League career.

And it looks like Hull City will miss out on the striker, with Sunderland having seemingly won the race for his signature.

Tigers boss Steve Bruce had admitted that injuries to forwards Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez would force him to step up his pursuit of a signing - but he looks to have missed the boat on Defoe.

Bruce said: ‘There’s been a lot spoken about Jermain Defoe.

'I, like Tony Pulis (of West Bromwich Albion) and Nigel Pearson (of Leciester City) and all the people, would like a Jermain Defoe. The numbers might cause a problem. It might be just beyond us.

‘The one thing you don’t want to do is gamble. We’ve seen all sorts of clubs get into a financial mess by pushing the boat out. But if there’s someone who can make a difference I’ll be knocking the door down like I always have done.

‘We’ve got to get an individual who can make a difference.’

Former England international Defoe represented the Three Lions on 55 occasions between 2004 and 2013, scoring 19 goals in the process.

He has also netted 123 Premier League goals for three different clubs during his career in English top-flight football.

Having started his youth career at Charlton Athletic, he was snapped up by West Ham United at the age of just 16 before being loaned out to south coast side Bournemouth for one season, where he netted 19 times in 31 appearances.

Upon his return to Upton Park, Defoe eventually broke into the Hammers side during the 2001-02 season - scoring 14 goals in 31 games.

His time at West Ham was extremely successful, with the striker returning 41 goals in all competitions before moving to Tottenham in 2004 for £6million.

During his first spell at White Hart Lane between 2004 and 2008, Defoe netted 61 goals in 170 appearances.

He then moved to Tottenham Hotspur and spent four years at White Hart Lane during his first spell at the club

He then moved to Portsmouth, where he managed 17 goals in 36 matches before returning to Spurs in 2009.

A further 76 goals followed for Tottenham before his move to the MLS last year - and Defoe will be looking to add to that tally at the Stadium of Light.
