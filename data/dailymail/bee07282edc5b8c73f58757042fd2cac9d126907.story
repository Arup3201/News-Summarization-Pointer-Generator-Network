An 11-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan shot dead a rare albino deer with his crossbow while on a hunting trip with his father last Monday.

While a child being able to hunt a deer may seem like a long shot, it's even more unlikely is that one could nab an elusive albino deer.

Gavin Dingman shot the buck while being supervised by his father Mick Dingman on a hunting outing.

USA Today reports that just one in 20,000 deer are born albino. Some biologists claim that just one in 100,000 deer are albinos.

'He kind of feels like a rock star right now. Everyone is calling, all of the hunting shows and hunting magazines,' Mick Dingman told the Livingston Daily.

This isn't the first time the Dingmans have spotted the albino deer either.

They've seen the majestic white buck several times in the past couple of years and have taken photos of it.

'The whole neighborhood is familiar with it. Quite a few of the guys in the neighborhood were trying to get it,' Mick Dingman said.

Gavin Dingman and his 13-year-old brother Graham take turns hunting with their father and on that one the Monday the deer was killed, it was Gavin's turn.

Mick told reporters his son was 'nervous' at first when attempting to shoot the deer.

'My dad was just like, take a deep breath. Are you sure you can take the shot? If you're not 100 percent, we don't want to injure it,' “the boy told The Livingston Daily.

Gavin was able to shoot the buck from 30 yards away.

'I double-lunged it,' he said.

This isn't Gavin's first hunting victory.

Last year he shot a deer 'straight through the heart.'

While Mick is proud of his son, he's received some criticism from outsiders for letting his son take a shot at a deer.

'I've had people tell me, "You should have taken the shot. You don't let an 11-year-old take a shot at a deer like that,” ‘he said.

'To me, in my opinion, it doesn't matter if it's a spike or a doe or a trophy deer. If you have confidence in them, it shouldn't matter what they are shooting at.'

To memorialize Gavin's big moment, a taxidermist will stuff and create a full-body mount of the deer.

'It's too rare and too pretty not to spend the extra money and have the whole thing done,' Mick Dingman said.

Gavin told The Livingston Daily that his friends and schoolmates are in awe of his accomplishment.

'They are like, wow, that is so cool,' he said.

What is a trophy deer for Gavin would be a misdemeanor in other states, reports USA Today.

Albino deer are illegal to kill in Illinois, Iowa, parts of Montana, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

Michigan also prohibited killing them up until 2008.

Other states don't have any restrictions based on the belief that albinos are inferior genetic stock.

The albino deer have poor eyesight and are pale which make them more prone to being caught by other predators in the wild--and in civilization.

Hunting albino deer are legal in Michigan but hunters are fined for killing them in states like Tennessee
