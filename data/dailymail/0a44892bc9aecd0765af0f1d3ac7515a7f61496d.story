Sam Allardyce has issued a withering riposte to Mauro Zarate after the West Ham United striker accused his manager of disrespecting him.

The Argentine, 27, has been allowed to join Queens Park Rangers on loan for the rest of the season, even though top scorer Diafra Sakho will be spending January at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal.

Zarate claimed Allardyce froze him out, adding: ‘He has made it difficult for me ever since I arrived.’

The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot

Co-owner David Sullivan sanctioned the three-year deal for Zarate in the close season.

Allardyce argued that the only reason Zarate’s time on the pitch had been limited was because he had not been good enough to displace Sakho, Ecuador star Enner Valencia or England’s Andy Carroll.

‘Clearly he’s a lad who is very frustrated at not being picked but all of what he is saying is not true,’ Allardyce said.

‘He wasn’t playing because he wasn’t good enough. Not good enough is a bit harsh because he is talented and he’s contributed well. But he’s not good enough to play as regularly as he wants compared to the others. It’s as simple as that.

Zarate has also been the victim of the excellent form of fellow new signings such as Enner Valencia

‘When you look at Valencia, Sakho and Andy Carroll and what they have achieved and what Mauro has achieved when he’s played, when we look at what he has contributed all round, and you have got that array of talent to choose from, then somebody’s going to be not happy.

‘Then you’ve got Carlton Cole sitting on the bench not coming on. He’s had more of a chance than Carlton Cole, who is one of my favourites. I love him. He’s a fantastic pro and a great guy, so it has nothing to do with a personal point of view.’

Allardyce was also bemused to be named by Jose Mourinho as one of the rival coaches the Chelsea boss believes is part of a ‘campaign’ to brand his players as divers.

Mourinho aired his theory after Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Southampton, where Cesc Fabregas was booked for a tumble in the penalty area.

Allardyce had been critical of Branislav Ivanovic, who was not booked for what looked like a dive in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over West Ham two days earlier.

‘What’s he on about?’ Allardyce said of Mourinho’s claims.
