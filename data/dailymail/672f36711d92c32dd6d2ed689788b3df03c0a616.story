For Jack and Nancy Gatewood, not even death could separate them.

A tale of true love, the pair, both 88, met as high school students in Ash Grove, Missouri. They soon became sweethearts and were married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Mrs Gatewood, who was a homemaker, had been in hospital dealing with complications related to a broken hip, pneumonia and flu before passing away around 5.30pm on January 15.

Mr and Mrs Gatewood were highschool sweethearts and married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma (pictured on their 50th anniversary)

Mr Gatewood, older by seven months, was heartbroken after spending three weeks away from his wife while she was in hospital - the first time they spent an extended time apart since the Second World War - and died without ever learning of his companion's passing, according to Tulsa World.

Before his family could tell him of the news of his devoted wife, Mr Gatewood, a retired insurance worker, died around 8.30am on January 16 as a result of cardiac arrest.

However, his family believes he suffered from a broken heart.

'I think he was missing her and didn't know where she was,' said son Jack Gatewood II, a pastor in Keller, Texas.

He added: 'We believe it was a broken heart. I know that's old-fashioned to say, that it doesn't hold up medically. But she had been gone from his life, and we believe he was grieving for her.'

As the time apart was difficult for Mr Gatewood, his family said people at his care home would find him wandering and asking where his wife was while she was in hospital.

The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood's return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years (pictured on their wedding day)

Suffering from dementia, he was unable to remember when they told him. And when she passed away, Jack II was on his way to see his father, who died before he reached him.

The last time Mr and Mrs Gatewood were together was in December.

Jack II said: 'The last time we saw them together they were kissing and holding hands. We were not expecting them to pass.' 

The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood's return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years.

Originally from Three Sands, Oklahoma, Mr Gatewood was living in nearby Everton, Missouri, at the time, when he and his soon to be sweetheart were joined together. He transferred to her high school in Ash Grove following the burning down of his school.

The pair began dating their junior year of high school and remained dating throughout Mr Gatewood's two years of serving in the Navy.

After they exchanged vows, the couple lived in their midtown home where they raised sons Jack II, Brad, Todd and Marc. They are survived by their sons, four grandchildren and three great-grand children.

The reason they were able to stay married for so long was because of their devotion and commitment to each other, said Jack II.

He said: 'They were very committed to marriage. They loved each other a lot, they were both faithful and they depended on each other.' 

As they enjoyed traveling and visits with friends, their favorite time together was spent with family.

By standing at the front door to their home, it was even evident family was important with the special door made of oak and that had symbols to mark each of their children.

Serving as a model for a successful marriage, their sons said the pair were in sync in everything they did and it was not until later in life that they ever saw their parents argue. 

Jack II said it was a blessing his parents were able to depart together.

Bonded together by love for nearly 69 years of marriage, Jack and Nancy Gatewood of Tulsa, Oklahoma entered into eternal life separately, less than 16 hours apart. 

Nancy passed away Jan. 15, followed by her husband Jack the next morning on Jan. 16. 

Jack Gatewood was born in Three Sands, Oklahoma on February 28, 1926. 

Nancy Gatewood was born in Ash Grove, Missouri on Sept. 26 also in 1926.

Having met during high school in Ash Grove, MO Jack and Nancy were married in 1946 upon Jack’s return from service with the U.S. Navy during WWII. 

After marrying, they moved to Tulsa, OK residing here until their deaths this week. Nancy was a devoted wife and homemaker while Jack built a career in life insurance, working 43 years for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. until his retirement in 2005.

The major focus of their lives was making a home for their four sons and enjoying extended family. They were long time members of Memorial Baptist Church in Tulsa.

Jack was a Life Member of the Million Dollar Round Table and served on numerous Tulsa boards. He was also active in the Rotary Club of Southside Tulsa. 

Nancy was a member of the American Sewing Guild and used her gifted creativity in numerous ways but especially in designing her own clothing. 

Their favorite times together were spent with family, friends, and traveling.

Jack and Nancy are survived by four sons: Jack Gatewood and wife Janie of Keller, Texas; Brad Gatewood and Todd Gatewood both of Tulsa; and Marc Gatewood and wife Alecia of Cape Coral, FL.
