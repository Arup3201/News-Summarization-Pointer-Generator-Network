A goalkeeper has been banned from wearing an all-pink kit to support his cancer-stricken mother.

Jack Turner, 20, who plays for Staines Town, had the garish outfit made especially to pay tribute to his mother Kim and to raise money for a breast cancer charity.

He was told he could not wear the brightly coloured strip because it was not the Middlesex side's 'official colours'.

He said: ‘I felt wearing the kit was the least I could do to support my mum and raise some money for charity in the process.

‘I expected to get a bit of attention from away fans but they have been very supportive. I cannot believe the league's attitude.

‘I
am not harming anyone and just trying to raise awareness. I never 
wanted to cause any trouble and do not understand what all the fuss is 
about.’

Staines, who play in the Blue Square South - five divisions below the Premier League, have even been threatened with a fine if Mr Turner defies the ban.

Heartbreaking: Mr Turner also wanted to wear the kit to support his mother who had breast cancer

Mrs Turner, meanwhile, has blasted the ruling as 'heartless'. She said: ‘The league are out of touch and need to grow a heart.

‘I am recovering from breast cancer along with my mother and my cousin, who have also got cancer and because pink is associated with that, Jack had this idea to wear the kit.

‘He has taken quite a lot of stick from visiting fans regarding the colour of his kit, but when they realise the reason he wears it they applaud and support him.

‘Recently supporters of Tonbridge Angels even passed a hat around behind his goal and at Farnborough the same thing happened.

‘No club has ever objected to him wearing pink at home matches but the Conference say it is unprofessional - despite being told exactly why he wears it.

‘All my son is trying to do it support me, the charity and raise awareness.’

Mr Turner, who played professionally for AFC Wimbledon, is not the first soccer star to wear pink in aid of charity.

Former England goalkeeper David James spent a year risking the wrath of away fans while playing for Portsmouth in 2009 to generate funds for the Wessex Cancer Trust.

The Premier League turned a blind eye but Conference general manager Dennis Strudwick has ordered Mr Turner to revert to Staines's registered colours of all-blue.

Mr Strudwick said: ‘Of course we are sympathetic to the situation but the simple fact is that we're a professional league and if we bent the rules once, we'd have to do it again.’
