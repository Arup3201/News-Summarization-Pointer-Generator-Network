They were the must-have present this Christmas. But drones proved the undoing of many a gadget fan yesterday.

Owners reported the remote-controlled devices, or unmanned aerial vehicles to give them their proper name, flying out of control and vanishing on their maiden flights.

Others crashed into neighbours’ gardens and roofs – while one even hit a dog.

Remote control drones have been an incredibly popular Christmas present this year, however the Civil Aviation Authority warned that many new users do not realise they are subject to stringent restrictions

The Civil Aviation Authority says users could be fined up to £5,000 if they do not follow rules when flying drones. It followed several incidents involving the devices, including one with a passenger jet at Heathrow, raising fears that they could cause a disaster in the skies. 

The devices usually have cameras attached to allow users to take spectacular aerial images and have become increasingly popular among those wanting to take selfie-style photos, or ‘dronies’.

Some models cost as little as £30, with the most sophisticated designs going for £3,000, and it is estimated that more than 30,000 will have been bought in Britain by the end of the year.

Dozens of people took to Twitter yesterday to reveal their delight at receiving a drone as a gift. But some failed to get off to a flying start when they took theirs out for a spin. 

Among those was Nick Hardy, a sports equipment salesman, who wrote on Twitter: ‘I got a mini drone for Christmas and it’s in next door’s garden already. Typical.’

Angela Ryan wrote on the site: ‘Christmas at the Ryans’: Drone stuck on the neighbours’ roof...’

And Twitter user @katystddybr had an unfortunate incident with her dog. ‘I got this little remote control drone thingy for Christmas and I accidentally hit my dog with it omg he hates me,’ she wrote. ‘It’s so bad he won’t come near me, I almost had to cut his fur to get it out.’

The incident at Heathrow involved an Airbus A320 passenger jet. A remote-controlled device flown by an unidentified amateur was spotted by the airliner’s pilot but, alarmingly, was not detected by air traffic control radars.

The UK Airprox Board, the air safety panel that investigates near misses, gave the incident the highest risk rating of A, meaning there was a ‘serious risk of collision’.

A CAA spokesman said: ‘We know that unmanned aircraft of various shapes and sizes have been popular Christmas presents this year. However, people have to understand that they are subject to rules and cannot be used indiscriminately.’

The Civil Aviation Authority says:

- Drone pilots should not ‘recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property’.

- They should not be flown out of sight of the pilot, generally 1,640ft horizontally or 400ft vertically.

- If fitted with a camera, a drone should be flown at least 164ft away from a person, vehicle or building apart from on take-off and landing.

- They should not be flown within 492ft of a congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert.
