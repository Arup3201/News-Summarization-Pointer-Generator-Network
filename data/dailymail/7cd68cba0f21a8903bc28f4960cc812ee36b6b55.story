Arsenal fans that queued outside Puma's flagship store for hours enjoyed their first glimpse of the club's new kits as Santi Cazorla, Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini stepped into the front window of the shop wearing the home, away and cup strips.

The Gunners timed their kit launch to perfection. On the same day the club announced the signing of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, their kit deal with Puma - worth a reported £30million-a-year - kicked into gear.

Cazorla, Arteta and Flamini were all present at a glitzy unveiling at the Puma store in Carnaby Street, before Arsenal spectacularly unveiled the kits to the public via a 20m high water projection visible from the North Bank of the River Thames, right in front of the London Eye.

The FA Cup holders announced their partnership with Puma earlier this year, ending a 20-year partnership with Nike.

It was announced as ‘the biggest deal in Puma and Arsenal’s history’, surpassing the £30million-a-year the club receive from main sponsors Emirates Airlines.

At the time, Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said: 'We are excited to be partnering with Puma, a company whose football heritage and record of innovation have a strong affinity with our own.

'This represents another important step forward in Arsenal's progression on and off the pitch.’

The timing of the launch could not come at a better time for the Gunners and their fans, as the club look set to announce the signings of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona and Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle.

Sanchez had been touted for a move to Liverpool as part of the deal taking Luis Suarez to the Nou Camp, but Arsene Wenger’s interest in the Chile international put an end to that.

The attacker is expected to fly to London from Spain on Thursday to finalise terms and undergo a medical to complete his £30million move to the Emirates.

Sanchez is set to sign a five-year deal worth in the region of £140,000-per-week, which will put him on par with Arsenal’s current top-earner Mesut Ozil.

Sales of the kit went live at 11pm, and
