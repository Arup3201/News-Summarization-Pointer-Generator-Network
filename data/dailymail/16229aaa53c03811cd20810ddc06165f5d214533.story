New parents Yasmin and Michael Burley say all they want is a screaming child and long, sleepless nights. 

Instead, their six-week old baby, Tate, is quietly fighting for his life at Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital.

Tate was born at 35 weeks with an extremely rare brain disorder, Miller Dieker Lissencephaly Syndrome, which means he will never cry or feed properly, and will probably not live past the age of five.  

'We just want him to cry,' Ms Burley told the Sunday Telegraph.

Baby Tate was born at just 1.7kg with an extremely rare brain disorder which means he can't cry or feed, and will develop severe intellectual disability

The Miller Dieker Lissencephaly Syndrome affects most of Tate's major neural systems and his parents are told his brain will not develop past the three month stage.

Tate's brain is abnormally smooth, without the grooves of a normal brain which receive senses. 

'I had to come to terms with Tate possibly being blind, deaf and having seizures,' wrote his mother to a Facebook page marking her son's journey. 'The word seizure makes me gasp. It is a fact and it will happen.'

A rare birth defect of the brain caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17.

People with lissencephaly have an abnormally smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves which cause intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and feeding difficulties. 

Feeding and swallowing problems are common, and can be complicated by aspiration pneumonia. 

Seizures usually begin before six months of age, and some occur from birth. 

Children with this condition usually die in infancy or childhood and it is normally caused by respiratory complications.

MDS is  usually not inherited from the parents 

A milestone for the family was when Tate managed to suck 6-10mls out of a bottle by himself during one feed. Another was when they heard him 'squeak'.

'Tate has no ability to cry however we also witnessed a sound today when he got restless .. Not a cry or scream but definitely a squeak!,' Ms Burley posted. 

But after just four days at home, Tate developed a cold and his parents rushed him back to emergency. His mother thought he was dieing. 

'Granny & I watched Tate lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air, dropping saturations & an excessively weak heart rate, white with blue lips, eyes rolled in his head, body flopped,' she said. 

Little Tate is now recovering with mum in hospital. She calls him her 'silent fire.' 

'Today my lesson as a mum is to use the fire inside me to deal with the things I cannot change for my son and except reality as it challenges me,' Ms Burley wrote on Saturday. 

'No one can understand how a family with a terminally ill child is feeling or the choices they make ...stand up, be an advocate for your child, don't feel pressure because people are more educated than you because I learnt today that I'm educated in what a palliative care patient is.'

The Burleys say it is especially hard to explain to their older sons, Zane and Kye, what is happening to their baby brother. But they hope to be home as a family again soon.

Friends and family have launched a MyCause fundraising campaign to help pay for Tate's care and more research into the condition. They hope to raise $100,000.

'Research is majorly lacking in Australia,' Michael Burley told Daily Mail Australia. 'The more awareness the better for other families.' 

The campaign has so far raised over $11,000.

'With this current money we can provide Tate with a respiratory sleep machine, correct bedding and feeding apparatus at home for the next few months without having to worry,' says Ms Burley. 

For now, the family are fighting with Tate and trying not to think too far ahead. The hardest thing, they say, is 'the not knowing.'
