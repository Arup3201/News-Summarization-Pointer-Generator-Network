The FDA has blocked the donation of a teen suicide victim's eyes because he was gay, it has emerged.

Alexander 'A.J.', Betts Jr., 16, of Pleasant Hills, Iowa, committed suicide in July 2013 after enduring more than 18 months of ridicule when he was outed as gay. Before his death he had registered as an organ donor.

After his passing, a 14-year-old boy was able to receive his heart, but his eyes have been rejected from donation because of the FDA rule saying men who've had sex with men in the last five years should be 'ineligible' for donating certain tissues because of the 'risk factor' of their behavior.

Betts wanted to be an organ donor but FDA regulations on tissue and blood donation from gay men have prevented anyone from receiving his eyes

'My
 initial feeling was just very angry because I couldn’t understand why 
my 16-year-old son’s eyes couldn’t be donated just because he was gay,' mother Sheryl 
Moore told KCCI.

The FDA's policy is a leftover from when the AIDS crisis was at its peak, and is part of an overall ban on blood from homosexual men. 

As The Washington Post reports, blood donation is held to even stricter standards, saying men who 'at any time since 1977 
(the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States) are currently 
deferred as blood donors.'

This is because 'a history of male-to-male sex is 
associated with an increased risk for exposure to and transmission of 
certain infectious diseases, including HIV.'

The FDA insists such a hardline stance is required, as there is a 'documented increased risk' of infections like HIV been transmitted and that are heightened when 'associated 
with male-to-male sex and is not based on any judgment concerning the 
donor’s sexual orientation.'

Betts's mother Sheryl Moore has called the policy preventing her son's eye donation 'archaic'

But critics call the policy archaic.

'We think it’s time for the FDA to take a serious look at 
this policy, because it’s out of step with peer countries,
 it’s out of step with modern medicine, it’s out of step with public 
opinion, and we feel it may be legally problematic,'; Glenn Cohen, a bioethics law professor for Harvard Law School told CBS.

Cohen argued the ban was contradictory as it only banned men who had sex with HIV-positive women or prostitutes for a single year.

And last summer, the American Medical Association voted to end the ban.

But the regulations on tissue donation are more nebulous than the blood bans.

A homosexual man's vital organs - such as the heart, liver, and lungs - can be donated as long as the recipient knows their origins and signs a waiver.

However, the FDA classifies eyes as human tissue, which is banned from use if the donor was a sexually active gay man.

Betts's liver, lungs, kidneys, and heart have all been successfully donated because in those cases as long as the recipient gave consent with knowledge of the risks and counseling, organs are allowed to be donated

However Betts's eyes were rejected because Moore could not confirm whether he was sexually in the years before his death. 

Betts's friends said he had struggled with bullying for years before he was outed as gay, having been teased over a cleft lip and for being half African American.

'He's different,' best friend Noah Lahmann told reporters after Betts's death. 'He doesn't add up to what they're used to.'

Moore says she's appalled by the regulations.

'It is just silly that people 
wouldn’t get the life-saving assistance they need because of regulations
 that are 30 years old,' Moore said.
