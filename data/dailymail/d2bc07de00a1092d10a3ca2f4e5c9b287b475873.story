A 45-year-old lawyer who plunged to his death from a Manhattan building on Friday was suffering from bi-polar, was still reeling from the deaths of his parents and had recently separated from his wife, friends say.

Leonard Morton, who represented the likes of Madison Square Garden and The Lincoln Center, jumped from a 12th-floor window and landed face down on scaffolding above the sidewalk on Broadway near Barclay Street at about 7.20am.

He died at the scene near City Hall, with officers quickly covering his body with a sheet as workers in neighboring buildings looked on as they arrived for work.

'He was going through a terrible, terrible depression,' close friend Linda March, 51, told The New York Daily News.

Deceased: Leonard Morton, 45, was described as 'very intelligent' and a 'good lawyer'. He took his own life on Friday morning in Manhattan

'He was a very intelligent person and a very good lawyer.'

Morton fell into a deep depression after his mother passed away in November 2011, friends said.

His mom, Deanna Morton, a partner at New York public relations firm InfiniTech, LLC, died in her sleep, aged 69.

'It would be hard for anyone to endure — you reach a breaking point,' a friend said.

'He was a wonderful son to both his mother and father.'

Morton worked for his mother’s public relations firm, Morton Communications, for several years, according to his online profile.

His father died about a year after his mother, friends said.

Leonard Morton eventually pulled out of his depression but went into a manic phase a few months ago, friends said.

He separated from his wife of three years, Dara.

He could get very boisterous and very loud when he was in that stage,' March said.

'It was very hard for her to deal with that.'

Morton lived with his cat in a luxury co-op on W. 93rd St.

Doctors recently adjusted his medications, sending him back into the pits of despair, March said.

In addition to running his own law firm, he worked as an administrative judge for the city's Environmental Control Board tribunal and was a part-time law professor at Hunter College.

He also volunteered as a captain in the New York State Guard, providing free legal services to military personnel.

March last spoke to Morton on Wednesday.

'He was telling me he was very depressed and he was having a hard time functioning,' she said.

'I said to him, ‘Let me help you.’

She ordered cardboard boxes from Amazon and planned to come to his apartment Sunday to help him get organized.

The night before he died, she texted with him, letting him know the boxes would be delivered Saturday.

'I wish I'd done something better or something more,' she said.

'He knew if he called any of us we would be there for him in a heartbeat. Never in my wildest dreams did I think he would do something like this.'
