Pensioners who live in expensive homes but don’t have enough money to pay a new ‘mansion tax’ will have their estates raised for the money after they die, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he had ‘a lot of sympathy’ with people who did not have very much money but had seen the value of their homes soar after buying it years ago.

But he said they would still have to stump up the cash owed under a new system to tax home worth more than £2million a year.

Mr Clegg wants to introduce extra council tax bands to force families in expensive homes to pay more money every year to help pay down the deficit.

The Labour Party has adopted the same policy – but has vowed to use the £1.5billion a year to hire tens of thousands of extra NHS staff.

But David Cameron has blocked the proposal over concerns it will hit ‘asset rich, cash poor’ pensioners if large homes.

Mr Clegg, speaking this morning in Glasgow at the Lib Dem conference, insisted that pensioners living in expensive homes did not need to worry.

He said: ‘They don’t need to pay it up front. They can pay it as part of their estate.

‘I have a lot of sympathy for someone who says, “Hang on a minute I bought my house 30 years ago I don’t have a big income but I’m now a multi-millionaire in terms of my property”.

‘All we’re saying is the council tax due in the council tax bands that we will introduce will be due, that’s normal. Everyone accepts you have to pay the council tax.’

Mr Clegg said the Tories were not prepared to tax the wealthy at all to reduce the deficit.

He said: ‘We’re saying that if you live in a property worth two million quid or more you should be paying council tax bands just as much as anyone on lower price properties.

‘I am sold on the idea that if you have council tax applied to people on bands to people on lower price properties why on earth don’t we have the same approach to higher price properties? We think it will raise around £1.5billion.

‘At the moment you’ve got this astonishing situation where a family home in Lewisham would pay the same in council tax as Russian oligarchs in a £10million mansion.’

Thousands of London pensioners face mansion tax bills from next year because the value of their homes have soared above the proposed £2million threshold

Mr Clegg added: ‘What I think you have to answer for people who don’t want to do this and this is another extraordinary example by the way – the Conservatives have said to me they don’t want to ask Russian oligarchs in 10 million quid houses to pay an extra single penny in contributions towards dealing with the deficit.

‘They don’t want to ask people like Alan Sugar – very wealthy retired pensioners to give up their TV licenses ort their winter fuel payments to help younger people who are trying to get a job – but they will ask the working age poor to cough up more money.

‘That is what is disingenuous about their position because we’ve always funded our fair tax cuts – by raising the point at which you start paying income tax - by asking the wealthiest in society to make a contribution.

The Conservatives are now saying that if they were in government they would give with one hand and take with the other.’
