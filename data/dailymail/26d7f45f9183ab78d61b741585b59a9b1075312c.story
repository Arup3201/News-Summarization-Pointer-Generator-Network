Cheerleaders, hot dogs, the star-spangled banner and 84,000 frenzied fans from all over the world. The NFL returned to London this weekend and, as always, put on a spectacular show.

A sea of different colour jerseys were worn by hoards of supporters across the capital, proving British sports fans do not hold back when the other type of football comes to the UK for its annual spectacle.

On the pitch, the Minnesota Vikings narrowly beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 34-27 after a nail-biting finish, giving the near sell-out crowd their money's worth.

The show at Wembley began when British rapper Tinie Tempah took to the stage to perform a set, with the help of a team of cheerleaders from the Minnesota Vikings.

Gene Simmons, the lead singer of Kiss, then took the microphone to perform the American national anthem before Laura Wright sang God Save The Queen.

The players were then welcomed onto the pitch by smoke machines and stunning pyrotechnics.

British boxer David Haye and Cheryl Cole were among the celebrities to attend the game, watching among fans, some of which had travelled thousands of miles to support their team.

The Geordie pop star tweeted after the match: 'My first NFL American football game at Wembley Stadium and the team I decided to support won.'

Both teams were looking for the first win of the season after suffering a poor start to their respective campaigns.

Greg Jennings made two touchdown catches, Adrian Peterson ran for two scores and the Vikings' defense made a big stop with time running out to preserve a 34-27 win over the Steelers on Sunday for their first win of the season.

Playing at Wembley Stadium, Everson Griffen stripped Ben Roethlisberger on the 6-yard line with 19 seconds left. Kevin Williams recovered to seal the victory.

Jennings made a 70-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown and Peterson had a 60-yard score to help offset two scores by Pittsburgh rookie running back Le'Veon Bell.

After the game, Peterson, who plays running back for the Minnesota Vikings said Wembley was, 'full of energy, atmosphere was electric, coming out that tunnel felt like a home game.'

The frenzied fans moved on to Wembley after taking over  Regent Street on Saturday afternoon as thousands of supporters gathered for a six-hour show.

The street was closed off to traffic as UK fans embraced the NFL spirit a 
day before the Minnesota Vikings and the Pittsburgh Steelers square off 
at a sold out Wembley Stadium.

Players from both teams made an appearance, including Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.

The US's most popular sport is in the middle of a serious export drive, and is looking to make inroads into a market usually seen as the home of the other type of football, soccer.

The NFL is one of the world's largest, and richest, sporting businesses, with annual revenues of more than £5.5bn.

Surveys for Sky Sports show American football is one of the top six or seven most popular sports in the United Kingdom.

The game was one of two which will be staged in London this year along with Jacksonville against San Francisco taking place on October 27.
