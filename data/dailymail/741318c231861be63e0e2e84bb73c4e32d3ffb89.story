Budget retailer Aldi has won yet another supermarket battle after it was revealed to have the cheapest typical shopping basket. 

A snapshot of a 15-item groceries in the UK today has revealed a £6.83 difference between the cheapest and the most expensive supermarket.

Aldi offered up the best deal at £14.75, at £1.87 less than its closest rival Asda, according to the comparison made using the mysupermarket.co.uk website.

The boost for the budget supermarket follows the launch of supermarket price war this week after Asda and Sainsbury's announced £450million in price cuts to stop millions of customers leaving for Aldi and Lidl.

A snapshot of a 15-item grocery basket in the UK today has revealed a £6.83 difference between the cheapest and the most expensive supermarket (pictured) 

And this was despite every grocer other than Aldi having either one or two items missing because they were 'unavailable'.

Tesco's basket came in at £17.87 followed by Waitrose (£18.82), Morrisons (£20.10), Sainsbury's (£20.21) and Ocado (£21.58). 

A selection of 15 standard grocery items such as milk, eggs, sliced bread, bananas and fish fingers were compared using Aldi as the baseline retailer.

This resulted in every one of the 15 items being included from Aldi, but the final tally showed Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Ocado had two missing items and Waitrose and Sainsbury's had one missing item. 

4 pints of semi-skimmed milk

6 large free range eggs

1 loaf of Kingsmill 50/50 medium sliced

1 pack of large vine-ripened tomatoes

350g of medium cheddar cheese

250g salted butter

1 bunch of organic fairtrade bananas

4 x 125g Optifit fat free yoghurt

900g frozen peas

10 pack of fish fingers

1 whole fresh broccoli

500g of penne pasta

500ml of washing up liquid

500ml of antibacterial handwash

9 toilet rolls

The figures follow Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's announcing major investments in price cutting this week alone, while Morrisons has claimed an industry first by promising to match the discounters on price.

Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Ocado all have price comparison schemes which gives shoppers money back vouchers if they could have bought their basket for less elsewhere.

But Aldi has never made any such pledge, instead focusing on expanding its product lines and catering for increasingly middle-class tastes, stocking everything from lobster to jodhpurs and skiwear. 

The UK supermarket sector has undergone tumultuous change in the last two years, with little in the way of good news for the middle-market Big Four.

Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have lost market share for the first time in a generation as customers depart in their droves for discounters Aldi and Lidl and the upmarket Waitrose and Marks & Spencer.

Gilad Simhony, chief executive of comparison website mysupermarket.co.uk, said middle-market supermarkets had struggled with the challenge of finding their niche while trying to offer low prices and quality.

He said: 'The supermarket industry has definitely become more competitive over the last couple of years.

Sainsbury's (pictured) have also announced major investments in price cutting in this week alone

'The response from many of the supermarkets has been to tighten their brand proposition and be more precise in their offering.

'Supermarkets such as Aldi and to a certain extent Asda have focused on being the best value and cheapest products. On the other scale, retailers such as Waitrose have focused on quality.

Tesco DOWN 2.7%

Morrisons’ DOWN 3.2% 

Sainsbury’s DOWN 1.8% 

Asda DOWN 1%

Waitrose UP 6%

Aldi UP 22.3% 

Lidl UP 18.3%

'Those supermarkets in the middle have struggled more as they overcome the challenge of providing the lowest prices but the highest quality.

'Over the next 12 months we would expect retailers to sharpen their brand positioning as the competition to retain loyalty becomes even harder.'

Aldi and Lidl have continued to attract increasing amounts of shoppers, albeit at a slower rate, suggesting that fierce price cutting by rivals may be beginning to have an effect.

Giles Hurley, joint managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, said the company was unconcerned about 'temporary price reductions from other retailers'.

'As a discounter, we will never be beaten on price and it is consistent everyday low pricing that is driving Aldi's success.'
