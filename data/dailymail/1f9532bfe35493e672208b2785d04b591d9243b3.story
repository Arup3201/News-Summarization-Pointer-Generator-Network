A seven-year-old girl was shot in the arm after her neighbor accidentally fired a gun more than 180 metres away.

The Michigan man was practicing firing his 9mm handgun when the last bullet missed the target and traveled across a cornfield before hitting Abby Wrobel on Tuesday.

She had been playing in the family's swimming pool in Tekonsha when the bullet ripped into her arm and narrowly missed hitting Abby's two-year-old sister Ella who was standing next to her.

Shooting victim: Abby Wrobel was shot in the arm by a stray bullet as she played on her pool deck

Her mother, Jodi Scherer, told Newschannel 3: ' I could have easily lost a child ...it’s just scary.'

She added: 'It came from the field and actually hit her up here, I mean how does that happen?'

The mother-of-six said her children had been playing by the swimming pool when they suddenly started screaming and running.

'I ran up and Abby said, "I’ve been shot!",' Ms Scherer said.

Her daughter described the moment she was shot as 'like a firework going into my arm'.

The bullet went straight through her arm and fortunately did not damage any bones.

Ms Scherer wants her neighbor, who has three children of his own, to be prosecuted. 'I mean, you can literally hear my kids 
playing at that house down there when they're outside. So he knew there 
were kids down there, he should have never been shooting this way,' she said.

Shock: Abby's stepfather Jeremy Stem, and mother, Jodi, fear she will be too scared to play outside now

The man, who is in his 30s and has a concealed weapons permit, could now be charged with reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury, Michigan police said.

Ms Scherer said that since the shooting her children have become too are afraid to play in the pool and run inside whenever they hear gunshots.

One of Abby's sisters added: 'I cried more than Abby did. I think people should be more careful with their guns.'

The
neighbor, who has not yet been identified, was said to have been shaken
up by the accident and plans to apologize to the family at the weekend,
according to NewsChannel 3.

In a post on Facebook Abby's stepfather, Jeremy Stem, talked of his shock at the shooting and added: 'Sad she is now going to carry the scar and afraid she will always be afraid to be outside.'

Distant shot: The bullet was fired by a neighbor and traveled more than 180 metres across a field before hitting Abby

A 2012 study of reports of stray bullets in the U.S. found that 317 people were killed or injured in 284 incidents over the course of one year. Of those, 81 per cent had been unaware of the events leading up to the gun being fired.

'Victims of stray bullets are essentially "collateral damage" and are usually disconnected from the events that lead to their injury or death,' Garen Wintemute told Science Daily.

'"They are innocent bystanders who typically have no opportunity to flee or take any other preventive measures,' the  director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis School of Medicine and Medical Center, added.
