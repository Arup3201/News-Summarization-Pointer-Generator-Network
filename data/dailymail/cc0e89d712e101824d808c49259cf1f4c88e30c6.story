England’s rollercoaster season came to a spectacular finale on Sunday when they pulled off a thrilling three-run victory over India after MS Dhoni narrowly failed to add to his reputation as the great finisher of modern limited-overs cricket.

There was no real context to this sole Twenty20 international, with 50-over cricket dominating the next six months, but the 24,000 crowd at Edgbaston were treated to the perfect example of the excitement the shortest format can provide.

It looked as though a star-studded India side jam-packed with Twenty20 expertise were chasing down England’s competitive 180 for seven with ease while Virat Kohli was at last displaying the class absent throughout this tour. 

Smashing: Morgan produced a magnificent display of clean hitting to boost England's score

Good start: Jason Roy reverse sweeps his second ball in international cricket to the boundary

Disappointing: Moeen Ali was out for a duck as England stalled during the first powerplay

Yet England, who had owed their batting riches to a welcome return to form from Eoin Morgan, clawed their way back into the contest through excellent death bowling from James Tredwell, Steven Finn and Harry Gurney.

Dhoni showed either incredible self-confidence or arrogance when India needed 17 off the last over from Chris Woakes, twice turning down singles and effectively telling his partner Ambati Rayadu to leave everything to him. 

But the man who has made his name and his fortune through guiding India home in last over finishes could not do it this time, managing only a single off the final ball when his perfect script called for him to clear the ropes for victory.

‘There are smiles in the changing room after a very tough summer,’ said stand-in England captain Morgan. ‘It’s great to be part of games like that, it’ s why you play the game. For young guys to experience this was brilliant and it was amazing to see how calm Woakes was during that last over.’

The match was almost a replay of last year’s Champions Trophy final in that the vast majority of the sell-out crowd were supporting India and the pitch, used and dry, was more like Bangalore than Birmingham. 

Happy boy: Eoin Morgan takes to Twitter to thank fans for their support

Long way: Alex Hales hit three fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 45 at the top of the order

Spectacular: Ajinkya Rahane takes a flying catch to dismiss Hales,as India fielded brilliantly

Big hitting: Morgan came in and began to dismantle the Indian bowling attack, hitting to all parts

Out of the ground: Morgan strikes one of seven maximums as England accelerated at the end of the innings

Yet that did not stop England taking the attack to India from the moment Alex Hales and Jason Roy, the big-hitting debutant, took 17 from Ravi Ashwin’s first over and set the tone for a refreshing, modern performance.

Roy’s first international innings was to end in disappointment, as did that of Moeen Ali, who was disgracefully booed loudly by a majority of the Indian support, presumably because of his Pakistani heritage. The trouble with that is that he was born and bred in Birmingham, as was his father.

At least the rest of England’s batsmen thrived in the ‘away’ atmosphere, with Hales hitting three sixes in his 40, to lay the foundations for a quite brilliant assault from Morgan, who looked so out of sorts in the one-day series.

It has been the most difficult summer for Morgan, whose form in 50-over cricket had collapsed to such an extent that questions were being asked about his place and he had appeared to lose ground in the captaincy stakes to Joe Root.

Yet this was vintage Morgan, displaying the unorthodoxy and pure timing that has made him one of the best limited-overs batsmen in the world. 

Keeping it going: Ravi Bopara took over the reigns after Morgan fell in the final over, blasting 21 from 9 balls

India were brilliant in the field, with Ajinkya Rahane’s sensational running pouching of Hales the best of his four catches, but their bowling was not at its best as one low full toss after another disappeared over the boundary.

An inability to force the pace against spin was England’s downfall in the one-day series but after another tentative start in the middle orders Morgan soon found his range, 100 coming off the 12 overs of spin England faced.

England saved their best for the last five overs, 81 runs being thrashed by Morgan, who finally holed out going for his eighth six of the innings, and Ravi Bopara, who returned to the side with a crucial unbeaten 21 off nine balls. 

Quicker one: Moeen Ali saw his second ball go for six before producing a flatter delivery to take a wicket

Help yourself: Shikhar Dhawan helps another leg-side delivery to the boundary as England bowled poorly

It was to prove a decisive contribution with India falling four runs short of the 40 they needed from the last four overs once the key wicket of Kohli, who hit 66 off 41 balls, had been claimed by Finn thanks to an excellent catch from Hales.

Woakes had won the domestic Twenty20 tournament for Birmingham by keeping his head in the last over and he did it again here despite Dhoni hitting the first ball of the final over, and far from a poor one, over mid-wicket for six.

But Woakes and England were to have the final word. ‘Rayudu is not used to batting at six or seven and it’s very difficult for a batsman to come in and just hit the ball,’ said Dhoni. ‘He wasn’t really middling many deliveries so I thought it was a better option for me to keep the strike.’ 

Class act: Virat Kohli put his recent poor form behind him, showing that he is a different player in T20 cricket

Maximum punishment: Finn walks back to his mark after being dispatched for another six

Bowled him: Woakes beats Shikhar Dhawan to slow the Indian charge but Kohli kept the runs coming

It was a decision that backfired for an Indian captain and his team, who have shown much more desire in the limited-overs games than they did in those last three woeful Test match performances.

That 3-1 Test series triumph will remain the highlight of England’s summer but they will have enjoyed ending this most up and down and sometimes traumatic of transitional summers on a high note.

Beauty: Raina can do nothing to keep out a fabulous yorker from Harry Gurney as England fought back

Final act: Dhoni hits the last ball of the innings, knowing that anything but a boundary isn't enough

Over the line: Woakes celebrates as the ball is fielded securing a win for England that had looked unlikely
