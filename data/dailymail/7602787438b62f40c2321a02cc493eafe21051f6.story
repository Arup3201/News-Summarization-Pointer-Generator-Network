A fraudster pretended to be the BBC 1 Bargain Hunt auctioneer so he could steal thousands of pounds from his bank account - despite looking nothing like him.

Anthony Wolstencroft, 27, from Blackley,
 Greater Manchester, walked into a Natwest bank in Prestwich, Greater Manchester and claimed to be Charles Hanson.

Mr Hanson, 36, is a celebrity auctioneer who has presented Bargain Hunt for ten years and used to present The Antiques Road Trip.

Anthony Wolstencroft, 27, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, pictured left, used fake documents to pretend he was antiques expert Charles Hanson, 36, pictured right, in a bid to steal £3,000 from his account

The court was told Wolstencroft used an 'excellent forgery' in his bid to obtain £3,000 from Mr Hanson's account in January this year.

But his cover was blown when staff became suspicious of the nervous way in which Wolstencroft was acting during the transaction.

Wolstencroft admitted fraud and possessing a fraudelent document but was spared a jail term. 

But he was told it was a 'very serious offence' and that he would go to prison if he did anything like that again.

During the hearing at Bolton Crown Court, the court heard how the postal worker handed over a fake driving licence to staff at the bank.

The licence contained Mr Hanson's genuine details, but featured a photo of Wolstencroft.

Although the driving licence - which bore the details of Mr Hanson, above, but used Wolstencroft's photo - was described as 'excellent forgery', staff became suspicious of Wolstencroft when he acted nervously

The conman also handed over bank details of Mr Hanson’s business, Hanson Auctioneers, to the cashier.

But prosecutor Andrew Smith said staff noticed that Wolstencroft appeared nervous and edgy.

The cashier then grew suspicious when Wolstencroft nervously asked to withdraw 'only £3,000' from the account.

When the cashier asked Wolstencroft to sign a withdrawal form, she alerted the manager to her suspicions and Wolstencroft fled the bank.

Wolstencroft was given a 12-month community order at Bolton Crown Court after pleading guilty to fraud and possessing a fraudulent document at an earlier hearing

But police later matched a fingerprint on the form to Wolstencroft's prints.

The court heard the fraudster told police when he was caught that he had met a man called Kevin at an open day for his employer TNT, who apparently owed Wolstencroft money.

The man apparently told Wolstencroft that he could get the money back by withdrawing it from the bank using the fraudulent documents.

During the hearing, Recorder Philip Curran also heard that Wolstencroft has a strong work ethic.

He had recently increased the number of hours he worked at TNT so he can provide for his family, the court was told.

The court also heard that Mr Hanson was informed about the fraud by police.

The auctioneer last year overcame testicular cancer and also raised £29,000 for stillbirth charity Sands, by doing the Great North Run, after his son was stillborn.

Wolstencroft was sentenced to a 12-month community order and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

Recorder Curran said: 'This is a very serious offence. Don’t regard this as being a soft option.

'If you do anything like this again you will go to prison.'
