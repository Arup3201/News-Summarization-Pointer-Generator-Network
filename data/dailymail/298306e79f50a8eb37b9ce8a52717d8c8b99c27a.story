Mini movie stars: Children are given the chance to experience a real red carpet

'We felt that everyone should be able to have their own little red carpet moment,' actress and Red Carpet Kids founder Eva Shure told ABC News.

'When the kids arrive they are greeted by a butler and security guard, who are both on headset, who are checking the kids in and making sure that they are on the list. 

'Then the butler is taking them to the red carpet, where they are going to be greeted by a correspondent and there's going to be paparazzi with real paparazzi cameras. 

'They're asking the kids questions about who they're wearing and about their upcoming projects.'

After making their red carpet debut, the young celebrities are whisked away to the green room, where they are given the chance to dress up in costumes and make their own movie which will then be screened in a special viewing room for them all the enjoy. 

The glamorous event is then topped off with an Academy Awards-style ceremony which sees the young party-goers rewarded with a variety of accolades from Best Actress to Best Dance Battle Moves.

'Kids are able to get that experience of winning an Academy Award and they get up and do speeches - everything you would think of in a real award show,' Ms Shure added.

If movies aren't your child's cup of tea, the company offers a number of other party packages, from a 'Frozen' Red Carpet Party to a Fashion Week Experience, and can also cater to clients eager to create their own tailor-made experience. 

'[The most ridiculous request] to date has been live reindeer,' the founder revealed. 'We were doing a holiday-themed event and they wanted these reindeer to pull a sleigh in with the birthday child.

'Probably the most expensive party is for a ten-year-old coming up and it's $20,000 for a kid. It's the Grammy's, so it's sort of live in concert at Lincoln Center.'
