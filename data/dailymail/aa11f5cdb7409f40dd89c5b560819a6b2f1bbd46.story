A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis has not yet been  introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price

A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations.

Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014.

The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75.

Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million.

GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. 

Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities.

Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014.

'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.'

Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week.

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'
