A former star pupil at one of the country’s leading state grammars faced a backlash yesterday after claiming the school is rife with racism, sexism and homophobia.

Matt Broomfield, who is now studying English at Oxford, claimed pupils at Adams’ Grammar in Newport, Shropshire, made monkey noises at him when he dated a black girl.

In an extraordinary online post, he also said a culture of ‘superiority’ was drilled into pupils and that girls were treated as having ‘secondary value’ and were regularly ‘groped, bullied and harassed’.

As well as bringing him academic success, he said the school ‘taught him to hate’.

But his scathing remarks prompted a backlash among pupils and alumni who challenged his view of the 358-year-old school, which is all-boys until the sixth-form and allows some pupils to board for £10,230 a year.

Supporters of the school included old boy and Blue Peter presenter Radzi Chinyanganya who said he ‘only had positive things to say’ about his time there.

Comments posted online described the claims as ‘exaggerated’ or accused Mr Broomfield, who achieved the school’s highest GCSE results with 11 A*s in 2010, of blaming the school for the ‘pathetic opinions he held as a teenager’.

The school itself has refuted the claims and said it was ‘saddened’ by the article, written for online student newspaper the Tab.

I dated a black girl when I was 17. When my school friends found out, some of them laughed openly in my face… They made monkey noises

When one of the three black guys in my year walked into a room, people would sometimes hide their possessions as a joke, because ‘all ******s are thieves’

If [a friend who has since come out as gay] had gone public with this information at school, he would have been laughed at and ostracised. At Adams’, they were a source of derision and disgust

Girls were generally treated as objects, to be called ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ and ‘stupid’. They were of secondary value

Adams’ drilled into us that the strong were always superior to the weak 

The post appears to have divided opinion, with some ex-pupils backing elements of Mr Broomfield’s assertions about the school’s culture.

Former pupil Mr Chinyanganya said: ‘I was at the school for seven years and it was the best seven years of my life – and I only have positive things to say about the school.’

However, Billy McClure, also a former pupil, said he took the article ‘as a personal attack on me, my friends and the best seven years of my life.'

He said he could ‘wholeheartedly say I never once saw an act of homophobia or racism.'

But he added: ‘First off, the school does have a problem with lad culture. Looking back, my participation doesn’t fill me with much pride. At times I was more concerned with binge drinking, showing off and objectifying women than I was about my grades.

‘I’m also ashamed to admit that we were undeniably sexist. This isn’t just an Adams or a grammar school problem but a nationwide issue. A lot of our teachers were women and they certainly didn’t approve of chauvinistic behaviour.’

 In response to the article the school, which has more than 860 pupils, said in a statement: ‘We disagree wholeheartedly with the view that Adams’ supports racism, sexism and homophobia.

‘In fact, precisely the opposite is the case: we make every effort to educate our pupils to be tolerant and respectful of diversity, and to counter prejudices that are, sadly, still all too common in the world outside school.’
