His Honour Judge Simon Brown QC has been criticised by the Court of Appeal for copying large parts of his ruling from the closing submissions of one side in a £1.8m court case

A top judge has been reprimanded after he copied almost every word of a ruling which left a father and son ruined by a £1.8 million debt.

Judge Simon Brown QC, who earns nearly £130,000-a-year for sitting on the bench, lifted 'word for word' chunks of one side's written arguments before condemning entrepreneur, Declan Crinion, and his elderly father, Tommy, to a life of penury.

Underlining that 'appearances matter', the Court of Appeal laid into Judge Brown's plagiarism and warned that such 'thoroughly bad practice' must never happen again.

Lord Justice Underhill said that 'almost all' of Judge Brown's ruling was 'taken word for word' from written submissions put in by financial brokers, IG Markets Ltd, who sued the Crinions after they lost a fortune gambling on derivatives at the height of the financial crisis.

Dismissing the Crinions' appeal today, 
Lord Justice Underhill ruled - 'not without some hesitation' - that, 
despite his copying, Judge Brown, who earns a total of £129,579-a-year, had 'performed his essential judicial 
role' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were 'sufficiently 
apparent'.

Despite 'a number of small verbal changes' made by the judge, the overall impression was that his decision was 'derived almost entirely' from IG Markets' closing submissions.

The Crinions' lawyers had calculated that, when setting out the facts of the case, Judge Brown had used 'some 94 per cent' of the words originally drafted by IG Markets' legal team. There was also 'no alteration whatever to the structure'.

The judge, sitting with Sir Stephen Sedley and Lord Justice Longmore, said: 'In my opinion, it was indeed thoroughly bad practice for the judge to construct his judgment in the way that he did.'

By adopting IG Markets' arguments wholesale, Judge Brown had given the impression that he had not considered the case independently and even-handedly.

Although there was 'nothing inherently wrong' in making use of such documents, Lord Justice Underhill said: 'I have never before seen a case where the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side's submissions in the way that occurred here'.

Sir Stephen Sedley said the Crinions said they felt the judge had never properly engaged with their case or fairly considered their defence when it was heard at the Mercantile Court sitting at the Birmingham Civil Justice Centre.

He added: 'The possibility of something approaching electronic plagiarism is new and it needs to be said and understood that it is unacceptable.

'Even if it reflects no more than the judge's true thinking, it reflects poorly on the administration of justice... appearances matter.'

He concluded: 'I hope that a judgment like this one now before us will not be encountered again'.

Sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Underhill dismissed the Crinions' appeal and said despite his copying, Judge Brown had 'performed his essential judicial role' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were 'sufficiently apparent'

Those tough words will, however, come as
little comfort to the Dublin-based Crinions, after the court ruled 
that, whatever his failings, Judge Brown had nevertheless reached the 
right result and the pair could not be let off the hook.

In his April 2012 ruling, Judge Brown had said that Declan Crinion, was 'charmingly frank about his addictive gambling nature and of his sad financial demise'.

He claimed IG Markets had let him down and the judge observed: 'As he put it, with a humour evocative of W.C Fields, "they should not open the bar and give an alcoholic the opportunity to drink more than was good for him".'

'I have never before seen a case where 
the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side's submissions in
the way that occurred here'

- Lord Justice Underhill

But Judge Brown said both he and his 
elderly father knew what they were getting into when they built up huge 
positions in financial derivatives known as 'Contracts for Difference' 
(CFDs).

Father and son had their accounts compulsorily closed down by IG Markets in February 2009, within months of the Lehman Brothers collapse, and were left holding debts totalling more than £1.8m.

Declan argued that although he operated all the accounts personally, only one of them was his limited risk responsibility. He also claimed IG Markets had overestimated his sophistication as an investor and should have limited his losses by closing the accounts sooner.

Tommy denied authorising his son to operate an account in his name - he said his signature on a crucial document had been 'forged' by his son - and both men argued IG Markets had failed to do enough to protect them as consumers.

However, Judge Brown - who observed that his ruling would leave father and son 'with little or no assets' - said the brokers had been under no obligation to give them advice and they were sophisticated enough to understand the risks involved.
