The former mistress of the father accused of killing six of his children in a house fire designed to frame her said that she and his wife would take turns to sleep with him in a caravan.

Lisa Willis, 29, was giving evidence in the case of Michael and Mairead Philpot, who are accused of torching their home to frame the mistress who had walked out of the home she shared with them.

Giving evidence from behind a curtain,
Miss Willis, 29, told the jury she and Mairead Philpott ‘took it in 
turns’ to sleep with Philpott, initially in a double bed in the box room
of the home and, later in a caravan on the driveway.

Miss
Willis added: ‘We never had all three of us together. One night it was 
with me, one night with Mairead.’ 

The woman who was not sharing 
Philpott’s bed would sleep on the sofa or ‘upstairs with the children’.

The court has heard Philpott, 56, his wife, and his ‘best mate’, Paul Mosley, 45, set the fire in a ‘joint enterprise’ to ‘set up’ Miss Willis – three months after she walked out on him with her five children.

Just hours after the fatal blaze last 
May, Philpott and Miss Willis had been due to face each other in a court
custody hearing to decide their children’s place of residency.

Hearing: Miss Willis told the court the woman who would be sleeping with Philpott on any given night went to a caravan with him, while the other woman slept inside with the children

Prosecutor Richard Latham QC said the 
alleged ‘set-up’ went ‘horribly wrong’ when the fire went out of control
because too much petrol was used, killing the six children Philpott had
with Mairead.

Yesterday, a
court heard that Miss Willis had a ten-year sexual relationship with 
Philpott, during which time she lived at the ‘cramped’ three-bedroom 
home he shared with his wife and up to 12 of his children.

Philpott slept with his wife and mistress on alternate nights.

As
well as the six children Philpott had with his wife – who all perished 
in the blaze – Miss Willis had four with the unemployed former baker, 
plus a fifth by another man who was raised as part of the family.

Miss Willis walked out of the Derby address in February last year.

The
court heard how Philpott – who bathed as little as once a month – had 
twice appeared on television with his two lovers in the mid-2000s.

The
appearances on the Jeremy Kyle Show and a documentary with the then 
Tory MP Anne Widdecombe led to Philpott being ‘lambasted as a benefits 
scrounger’, with the family seen as ‘shameless’, the court heard.

Nottingham
Crown Court heard the girls would share one bedroom and the boys 
another, with both women’s eldest children eventually sharing the box 
room.

A jury trying the Philpotts were yesterday told Miss Willis acted as a bridesmaid at her then lover’s second wedding.

Another
photograph of the 2003 nuptials obtained by the Daily Mail shows Miss 
Willis, in a blue trouser suit, posing with Philpott’s bride, Mairead, 
31, who is dressed in cream.

Miss Willis said that when the Philpotts decided to marry, she was a bridesmaid, and she and Mairead Philpott were good friends.

She
treated their children as her own, she said, regularly sharing 
childcare responsibilities with the other woman, and said she was 
‘devastated’ when the six Philpott children died.

Miss
Willis said the two women were responsible for housework and feeding 
the children, while Philpott would ‘do nothing – just sit and watch 
telly’.

She said that when 
the children approached him for help with homework or to read to them, 
he would tell them to speak to the two women because he was ‘trying to 
watch telly’.

Miss Willis 
later agreed with a suggestion from Anthony Orchard QC, defending 
Philpott, that ‘personal hygiene was not a high priority’ for the 
father.

She added: ‘He never
changed his clothes’, but agreed that Philpott was a ‘good father’, who
was never violent towards the children.

She
admitted a court affidavit she had signed as part of the custody battle
wrongly stated that Philpott was violent towards her on a ‘weekly 
basis’.

During 
cross-examination, Miss Willis, a former waitress and cleaner, also 
admitted that during the first two years of her relationship with 
Philpott, she two-timed her lover with his own grown-up son from a 
previous relationship.

The 
court heard Miss Willis, an orphan, was introduced to Philpott in 
October 2001 by her older sister, Amanda Cousins, who used to babysit 
for him.

Miss Willis lived with Mrs Cousins from the age of 12, when their mother died, to 16, when she gave birth to a neighbour’s baby.

In
2002, Philpott invited Miss Willis, then 17, to move in to the house he
shared with Mairead and their two young children, because she wanted a 
bigger property than her two-bedroom council house.

Philpott, a father of 17 by five women, 
became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house 
to share with his wife, his girlfriend Lisa Willis, and eight of his 
offspring.

The
couple, together with forklift driver Mosley, all of Derby, are each 
charged with the manslaughter of the Philpotts’ children – Duwayne, 13, 
Jade, ten, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five. All 
three defendants deny the charges. The trial continues.
