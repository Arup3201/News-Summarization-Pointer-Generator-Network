A raucous group of Paris St Germain fans have posted a spoof video on the internet lampooning Chelsea following the London club's humiliating exit from the Champions League. 

Short video, which was uploaded earlier today, shows a dejected 'John Terry' standing on the platform of the Paris metro as a train pulls into the station. 

The carriage is packed with a gang of PSG fans, who are chanting 'Here is Paris' in a good humoured fashion at the man, who is wearing a replica  shirt bearing the Chelsea captain's name.

The man, wearing a Terry 26 jersey waits for the speeding train to stop before he can board 

Unfortunately, the carriage is full of jubilant Paris St Germain fans who are through to the next round 

As the fake John Terry attempts to board the train, he is pushed back by the smiling fans. 

The video is a response to a video featuring Chelsea fans on the Paris metro where a black man is prevented from boarding the train.

As the train pulls away from the station, the sad-looking John Terry lowers his head as he contemplates the end of his Champions League dream. 

In a final barb to Chelsea fans, the video features a shot of a sign with the Champions League logo and Berlin 2015 - where the final is being held. 

Chelsea had offered the victim of the Paris metro racism row a free trip to last night's second leg. 

But the victim, Soulemayne S said he could not go to the game because of the impact of last month's incident. 

He said: 'This offer to go, this invitation, is just an attempt to make things up. For the moment I don't want to come because of what they've caused, the team and their fans.

'The Chelsea supporters have destroyed me. Even when I drive my car I feel like I'm being followed. I don't know if I am being followed by Chelsea fans, or police or the media.

'Even when I go and see my lawyer I am followed, when I go to see my therapist I feel like I'm being followed, and I've never had that in my life.

'The only problem I have in my life right now is because of Chelsea and their fans.'

Meanwhile, five men linked to the incident have been served with summonses to appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. 

Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or local police, the Home Office website says.

They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison.

The video ends with a sign featuring the Champions League logo and an arrow pointing to Berlin
