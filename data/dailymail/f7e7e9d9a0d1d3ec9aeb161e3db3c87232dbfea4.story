'Master': Frank Bourassa claims that he is the best counterfeiter working globally today

A Canadian counterfeiter who made up to $250million in fake American cash has been released from jail after only a month and a half behind bars and a minimal fine.

Frank Bourassa has delved into the details of his operation with 20/20 and told how the process was startlingly easy.

'It was like, screw you,' Bourassa said of his message to the U.S. government.

The paper was made in Swiss and German mills that made the specific cotton and linen blend used in the U.S. currency under the guise of being for a different- legal- operation.

'You have to start with that...It’s got this crisp feel. If you don’t have that you’ll have nothing,' Bourassa told ABC's Brian Ross.

From there, he sourced the ink and the detailed security features added to each bill in China and had the different parts shipped to a Canadian town outside Quebec.

The $20 bill is thought of by counterfeiters as one of the easiest to emulate because it was last updated in 2003 and all of the parts of the creation process can be sourced online.

Caught: Investigators were tracking his fake $20 bills for four years before he finally ended up behind bars, briefly

A skilled printer helped him put ink to paper and from there, he claims to have sold the batches of fake bills in bulk.

The criminal groups that he sold the counterfeit bills to made out well, getting $1million in fake bills for $300,000.

Bourassa's operation has been going on for years and ABC reports that the first one of his counterfeit bills was spotted in Michigan in 2010.

From there, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Team and the U.S. Secret Service worked together to track him and his bills.

Sourced online: He arranged to have the paper necessary- with the correct mix of linen and cotton- made at a mill in Germany

He eventually got a lawyer and struck a deal with investigators that led to a $1,500 fine in Canadian dollars and spent just six weeks in jail before being released in late March.

The Secret Service says that Canadian officials led the investigation and Bourassa is not currently wanted in the United States so he will not be extradited.

One factor that still has investigators worried is that Bourassa may be taking credit for leading the operation- and calling himself the best counterfeiter currently working today- in order to cover for other criminals who actually led the operation.

On top of that, he has avoided answering whether or not he has hidden more stacks of bills.

'It takes a network of people to pass all these bills, it’s a huge quantity so you can‘t just trust a couple of people,' Mounted Police investigator Dan Michaud said.
