Two mothers who became best friends when their babies were born on the same day have repeated the double act two and a half years later.

Claire Ottaway and Michelle Noble got chatting when they were in neighbouring hospital beds in Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after having boys Ben and Henry on March 8, 2012.

And last month they were back alongside each other as they gave birth on the same day - July 30 - for the second time at odds of 270,000-1.

This time teacher Claire, 33, had daughter Evie who arrived at 10.11am by elective C Section weighing 6lbs 6oz.

Michelle’s daughter Isabel was born just under two hours later at 12.06pm weighing 6lbs 4oz.

Claire, who is married to B&Q worker Rob, 32, and also has son Jake, five, said she was delighted to have shared the birth date with Michelle, 29, again.

She said: 'I was actually supposed to have Evie a week later but doctors decided they ought to get her out earlier and brought it forward to the same birth date as Michelle. We just couldn’t believe it.

'It is so lovely that we have been able to share this whole journey together.

'When we first had Ben and Henry I was able to offer Michelle loads of advice because I’d already done it before with Jake.

'But we couldn’t believe it when we both fell on pregnant again at the same time.

'This time we’ve been able to share the whole pregnancy together, being at the same stages, with morning sickness and bloating and tiredness, together.

'We have really helped each other through.'

Claire and Michelle first met in March 2012 when they found themselves side by side in Scarborough Hospital in North Yorkshire.

Michelle’s first son Henry arrived first on March 8 at 4.07am weighing 7lbs 20z and Ben - Claire’s second son - followed at 9.46am, weighing 8lbs 5oz.

The two women, who live in Scarborough, swapped numbers and kept up their friendship at post-natal groups.

They then started meeting every Monday and have continued to do so every week since.

Second time around, occupational therapist Michelle and husband, electrical supervisor Tom, 28, learned they were expecting again at the end of 2013.

Michelle told Claire straight away but Claire managed to keep her happy news to herself until her three month scan.

Michelle said: 'It was so exciting to be pregnant together, but to give birth again on the same day - what are the chances of that? And we both had the same sex children.

'It was good because I did not know what I was having so my newborn clothes were all neutral.

'When I had a little girl, Claire, who knew what she was having, gave me a pink babygrow to put Isabel in.

'The hospital were so good with us, they let us stay in the beds next to each other. They were chuffed for us because they’ve never seen anything like this before.

'It was so lovely to be in hospital with a great friend. We helped each other through times of worry and never got bored. We are besties.

'And now our children are going to be good friends too.

'The boys already get on great together, they both like the same things, they are both mummy’s boys and quite placid, and we have so much fun together.

'They reached milestones, such as walking and talking at relatively the same time, and it was great to share those moments.

'It is lovely that this will keep on going and we will be raising our families together.

'We have decided in future we will have to combine birthday parties.

'Although now, I have decided I’m not going to have any more children so if Claire decides to have any more she is on her own.'
