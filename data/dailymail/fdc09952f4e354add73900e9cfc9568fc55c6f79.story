President Barack Obama will sign legislation imposing new economic sanctions on Russia, as the U.S. claims some credit for sparking Moscow's roiling currency crisis and moves to deepen the pain. 

The Russian economy has been in a downward spiral for months, but President Vladimir Putin has managed to maintain political support at home.

However, White House officials acknowledged there were no guarantees Russia's economic woes and another round of sanctions would compel Putin to curtail aggressive actions in Ukraine.

It comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel pursues a policy of engagement and has spoken with Putin how he could go about imposing a comprehensive ceasefire in war torn Ukraine.

Following President Obama's (pictured) decision to sign-off the bill, a White House spokesman said it was hoped the latest round of sanctions would 'sharpen the choices' Putin faces in Ukraine

'The aim is to sharpen the choice he faces,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said of the sanctions. He said Obama was likely to sign the bill this week after the measure cleared Congress late Saturday.

Obama's support came as the Russian ruble continued its precipitous fall. The impact of the Western sanctions has been compounded by plummeting oil prices, leading Russia's Central Bank to announce a massive middle-of-the-night interest rate increase Tuesday in an unsuccessful bid to stabilize the currency.

Obama economic adviser Jason Furman said Russia was grappling with a crisis of its own making.

'The combination of our sanctions, the uncertainty they've created for themselves with their international actions and the falling price of oil has put their economy on the brink of crisis,' Mr Furman said. 'That gives you only bad choices.'

Mr Earnest said the president had concerns about the measure but felt it gave him 'flexibility' in carrying out lawmakers' stipulations.

The legislation includes a waiver allowing Obama to forgo the penalties if doing so was in U.S. national security interests. Administration officials wouldn't say whether Obama planned to exercise the waiver.

The legislation has widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill but has worried Europe, where leaders fear unilateral U.S. action will undermine the West's united front against Moscow.

For months, the U.S. and European Union have sought to enact sanctions against Russia in tandem. But Europe, which has a far more extensive economic relationship with Russia than does the U.S., has largely reached its limit for enacting broad sanctions against the Russian energy industry and other key economic sectors unless the Kremlin ramps up its actions in Ukraine.

However, in an apparent attempt to maintain some Western unity as Obama signs the legislation, a Western diplomat said the U.S. and EU were preparing similar packages of trade and investment bans in Crimea, the strategically important peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine earlier this year. 

Those penalties could be announced in the coming days, according to the diplomat, who was not authorized to discuss the pending action publicly and insisted on anonymity.

Following the takeover of Crimea, Kremlin-backed rebels began occupying cities in eastern Ukraine, near Russia's border. The West has accused Russia of supplying and supporting the rebels.

Ukrainian officials have been pressing the U.S. to supply its military with weapons and ammunition to fight the Russian-backed forces. Obama has resisted those requests because he fears lethal assistance would antagonize Russia and perhaps spur Moscow to launch a full-scale invasion.

The legislation gives the president the authority to send Ukraine anti-tank weapons, counter-artillery radar and tactical surveillance drones. Administration officials said Obama was not expected to act on that authority.

The bill does require the president to impose penalties on state-owned arms dealer Rosoboronexport and other Russian defense companies tied to unrest in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Syria, unless the president invokes his waiver authority. The sanctions would be extended to people and entities helping the companies.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called Putin to discuss possible steps to secure a comprehensive cease-fire in eastern Ukraine.

The call late Tuesday came as Russia grappled with a sudden drop in its currency, the ruble. Moscow has accused the West of trying to inflict economic pain on Russia for political ends.

Merkel's office said Wednesday that the two leaders were joined by French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in the discussion.

It said they agreed on the need for increased humanitarian aid, including by Ukraine, to separatist-controlled parts of the east.
