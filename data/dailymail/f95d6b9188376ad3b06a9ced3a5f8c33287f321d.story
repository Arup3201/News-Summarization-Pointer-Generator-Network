A British woman has died when she plummeted to the earth while paragliding in Tenerife.

Carolyn Dewdney was flying in the mountainous area of Adeje in the south of the Canary Island during a trip with her husband, the flight's organiser confirmed.

Mrs Dewdney, 53, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was on a week-long paragliding holiday with her husband Nigel, who participated in the 2010 Paragliding World Cup and is the chairman of Malvern Hang Gliding Club, based in Worcestershire, according to reports.

Henry Willder, who runs Para 42, the specialist company which organised the trip, said Mrs Dewdney was believed to have suffered a heart attack during her flight and her husband was 'inevitably, absolutely devastated' following her death.

'We don't know for sure yet but it's believed she suffered a heart attack while flying and died,' Mr Willder said. 'That's what the forensic doctor who attended the scene told us.

'Until the complete autopsy takes place, we won't know anything more.'

Mrs Dewdney was flying in a group of six including her husband and Mr Willder when she fell at around midday yesterday afternoon.

The group were more than an hour into their flight when Mrs Dewdney, who reportedly worked as a nurse at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, got into difficulty, Mr Willder said.

'Immediately when I saw she was in trouble I radioed to our ground crew to call for an air ambulance,' he added.

Although a helicopter was scrambled, Mrs Dewdney was already dead by the time rescuers reached her, it was reported.

The rest of group found flat ground to land on about a mile away from the site where Mrs Dewdney crashed.

According to the forensic doctor who examined her at the scene, she had only suffered slight injuries including a broken arm, Mr Willder said.

Simon Dillworth, a chief coach at Malvern Hang Gliding Club, confirmed they were aware of Mrs Dewdney's death and described her as a 'very experienced' paraglider.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national, Carolyn Dewdney, on November 12 in Tenerife, Spain.

'We are providing consular assistance at this difficult time.'
