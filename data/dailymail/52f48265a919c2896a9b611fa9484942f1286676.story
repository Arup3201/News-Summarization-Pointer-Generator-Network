It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a... whale? The aircraft widely considered the world's strangest-looking plane celebrates 20 years in the sky this week.

The Airbus A300-600ST  earned its nickname for the plane's uncanny resemblance to the white Beluga whale, with its distinctive hump on its head.

The Beluga, a transport aircraft, made its maiden flight on September 13, 1994.

Originally named the Super Transporter, the plane's monicker became so popular that it stuck, and was adopted for official use by Airbus shortly afterwards. 

The odd-looking aircraft has been specially modified to transport large plane parts such as wings between Airbus' European production factories.

Since the 1994 original, four more Belugas have been produced, and all remain in use, making approximately 60 flights per week.

Airbus expects the Beluga fleet to double its activities by 2017. 

'In order to accompany this challenge, Airbus launched in 2011 the Fly 10 000 project,' a statement ahead of the anniversary read. 

'Flight crew numbers and flight hours have grown and loading procedures have been further optimized, with the opening of new integrated loading facilities in Hamburg and Bremen in Germany and Saint-Nazaire in France. Broughton, UK and Getafe, Spain will follow soon.'

'The Beluga is an essential element of Airbus’ integrated logistics and production ‎system,' said Günter Butschek, Airbus Chief Operating Officer. 

'It is thanks to its reliability and engagement of the Beluga teams that we can fulfill our constant pursuit of efficiency.'
