A New Jersey cheerleader who sued her parents for child support after she moved out was today pictured leaving her family's home with her mother after returning to the house this week.

In an apparent sign that the family were attempting to return to normality after their embarrassment, Rachel Canning, 18, climbed into her car to head to school on Thursday while her mother Elizabeth climbed into a separate vehicle. They were followed by her father Sean and a younger sibling.

Rachel returned to the 
Morris County home with her tail between her legs on Tuesday night after a judge took a very dim view of her lawsuit demanding her parents pay child support, college tuition and other expenses last week.

Her parents had claimed that their daughter ran off 
in October to stay with friends because she refused to abide by 
rules they had put in place, including to stop dating her boyfriend.

Back to normal? A judge denied an emergency order to require the parents to pay child support

Though Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child support after kicking her out for failing to abide by their rules, she was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's lawyers and the judge himself.

Last week, the judge said Rachel had given her mom and dad, Sean: ‘The proverbial f you’.

'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said.

He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?'

'Happy families': The Canning family headed out for the school run on Thursday morning

School run: Rachel's father, Sean, and sister headed out from the home separately on Thursday morning

Stress: The judge who dismissed the case said the ordeal had affected her younger siblings

Back to the books: Rachel also requested a legal guardian following the case - but it was denied

Despite the mother and daughter's attempt at playing happy families on Thursday, Rachel's attorney had requested a court-appointed legal guardian for the girl - which was promptly denied.

'Just a few days ago, Rachel Canning 
indicated she could not go back home with her parents and she required a
 promise of some financial assistance going forward,' attorney Tanya Helfand wrote.

'Now, after speaking with her mother yesterday, she said she is waiving 
her complaint and is receiving no promises or consideration in return.'

But she said Elizabeth and Sean Canning should now be responsible for paying for a legal guardian for their daughter, who had branded her parents abusive, the New Jersey Star-Ledger reported.

'A psychologist certified that the parents are abusive. School faculty certified that the parents abuse the child,' Helfand wrote.

Reconciliation: Rachel Canning has apparently 
come to her senses and returned to her parents' home after their very 
public falling out after she took them to court to pay for her when she 
ran away

Back home: Rachel's parents have welcomed her back to their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home (pictured last week)

But Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard - last week refused an emergency order to require the couple to pay - denied the application.

On
 Wednesday afternoon, the lawyer representing Rachel's parents held a 
press conference confirming that the family was reunited on Tuesday 
evening, but would not say what had sparked it.

'My
 clients will be known for this for quite some time... As far as my 
clients are concerned it's over, it's done,' attorney Angelo Sarno said.
 'Rachel's back home.'

'This is a long process, it's only the beginning,' he said according to the Daily Record. 'This
 is a private matter. It should have never been brought to the court's 
attention. It should have never been brought to the public.'

Mr
 Sarno added that the family wishes for the matter to remain private 
from now on, but felt the pressure to address their reunion in case it 
came out later.

Speaking out: Angelo Sarno, the attorney who represented Mr and Mrs Canning in the ordeal, spoke about the reunion Wednesday at a press conference

Welcoming her back: Elizabeth and Sean Canning, seen during the court hearing, have apparently reached a settlement with their daughter but her lawyer said that no financial incentive was given

'Her 
return home is not contingent on any financial and/or other 
considerations,' Mr Sarno said in an earlier statement released 
Wednesday.  

'They're not athletes, they're not actors. They didn't ask for this attention... Please respect the Canning's privacy.  It's ancient history, it's done... This is a happy situation.'

He said that while they are happy that it is now resolved, their two other children have been affected.

'Nothing good can come from this,' Mr Sarno said.

The
 ordeal is not entirely over, however, as the judge scheduled an April 
court date to consider the over-arching question of whether the Cannings
 are obligated to financially support their adult daughter. 

Judge
 Peter Bogaard read an expletive-laden and vicious voice message left by
 Rachel to her mother, in which she said: 'I wanna s*** all over your 
face'.

'Spoiled': The judge in her case was one of Rachel's most vocal critics asking how it had come to this

Emotional: Both Sean and Elizabeth Canning began crying in the courtroom  as their lawyers defended their actions, explaining that they had to enforce their rules with their often rebellious child

In shocking legal documents submitted to the court, the honor-roll student said her parents’ behavior contributed to her developing an eating disorder at a young age and saw her weight plummet down to 92 pounds. She also said that her father had an 'inappropriate affection' for her.

A Department of Children and Families 
investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's 
parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion
 she was just 'spoiled'.

But she argued that since her parents have a combined yearly income of between $250,000 and $300,000 and she is entitled to $654-a-week in child support.

Her parents have also refused to pay $6,000 owed in school fees for her Catholic High School.

Her parents claim their daughter ran off 
to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by 
rules they had set down, including to stop dating her boyfriend.

Friend in some kind of need: Rachel was seen with her friend Jaime Inglesino, whose family took her in and paid for her legal fees

Starring each other down: Sean Canning and Rachel exchange tense glances during their day in court

But the judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit. He said: 'What kind of parents would the Cannings be if they didn’t try to set down some strict rules?

'I'm not going to put myself in anyone's shoes, he's (father Sean) trying to raise a child. It's clear to me all the positive qualities Rachel obviously has, in terms of sports and academics, but I’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks, to put it mildly.'

When summing up later he denied all immediate financial claims, including monthly maintenance, private school payments and legal fees.

Through the hearings, it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk.

Trying to excuse the suit: The 18-year-old has offers to attend several colleges and is an 
accomplished cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to one day be a 
biomedical engineer

Princess: Rachel even accused her mother of being the cause of her bulimia, claiming that Mrs Canning had called her 'porky' and 'fat'. Mrs Canning because she tried to help, Rachel developed a 'hatred' towards her

Bragging: Rachel was heard bragging by teachers that she had a bottle of Everclear. They searched her car, didn't find any and the teacher who hauled her into an office was convinced she was drunk

Senior tutor William Schilling spotted Rachel out in the parking lot with a group of boys – including her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller – and thought they were acting suspiciously.

Earlier in the evening Rachel, now 18, had apparently been heard loudly boasting that she had Everclear, a brand of vodka.

Her pleas for immediate financial assistance were denied in a hearing at Morris County Court on Tuesday, but Judge Peter Bogaard set a trial date for April 22.

Rachel’s controversial legal battle is being funded by the father of her best friend, millionaire lawyer Jon Inglesino. The Cannings believe he is enabling their daughter's behavior and encouraging her to take the matter to court.

Throughout the trial, she was living in her friend's large mansion in Rockaway Township, New Jersey.
