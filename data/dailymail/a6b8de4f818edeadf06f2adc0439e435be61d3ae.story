He's notoriously reluctant to answer questions about his relationship with Kim Sears but Andy Murray has been forced to deny that he plans to marry his long term love this year after joking about his love life on Twitter.

Asked when he plans to marry Miss Sears during a Twitter Q&A with fans, Murray responded: 'We're getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.'

But just hours later, Murray was forced to issue another tweet explaining that his words were said with his tongue firmly in cheek after the original message went viral.

He tweeted: '3 things.. I don't smoke grass, I'm not getting married(yet) and I don't want to kill rafael Nadal.. [sic]'

A spokesman for the star confirmed that 'Andy Murray is not getting married this summer.'

The latest incident isn't the first time that Murray has been quizzed about his love life by fans on Twitter.

Earlier this month, Murray took to Twitter for another Q&A session during which he revealed everything from his favourite cereal - Frosted Mini-Wheats - to his favourite tennis player.

But he was left red-faced when former professional Darren Cahill asked about a wedding date for him and girlfriend Kim Sears,

Brusquely, the tennis star replied: 'Don't start!' before continuing to answer questions from fans.

effusive about his girlfriend

He was even asked whether he planned to marry Miss Sears following his win at Wimbledon last summer but, although still refusing to commit to a wedding, has admitted to contemplating having a family with his long term love.

In December, he spoke about his relationship with Miss Sears during an interview with the Scottish Daily Mail and confessed that he would like children with her in future.

He said: ‘I can see myself having a family one day. It is something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’

Perfect match: The Scottish tennis star first met Miss Sears at the US Open

Murray was effusive about his girlfriend, who he first met at the US Open in 2005, in his book reflecting on his life and career so far, which was being serialised in The Times newspaper.

Writing in the book he said: ‘You’re in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it would be easy to get your head turned.

‘But Kim’s always been there for me. She really cares about me and helps with so many things. She always has. That’s why we have such a great relationship.’
