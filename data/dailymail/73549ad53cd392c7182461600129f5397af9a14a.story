Police have made multiple arrests and issued more than two dozen search warrants as part of a months-long investigation into baggage theft at Los Angeles International Airport.

The investigation, which involved 
officers going undercover among baggage handlers, began after a string 
of reports of luggage thefts from terminals, runways and planes, police 
said.

Those arrested were primarily employees 
or ex-employees of contracting companies hired to handle luggage and do 
not work for the airport itself, Hyams said.

Arrested: 25 different baggage handlers hired through a contractor to work at LAX were arrested either at the airport (pictured) or their homes on Wednesday night

Sticky fingers: The investigation into missing luggage had been going on for months

The LAPD chief tasked with leading the operation would not name the contracting company involved.

The company had already run criminal and employment background checks on the individuals before hiring them.

'It’s a disappointment, but a fact of life, that sometimes a few people will succumb to the temptations at LAX,' irport police Chief Patrick Gannon told KTLA.

'The actions of these few do not represent the nearly 45,000 individuals who work for the nearly 350 employers at LAX.'

Detectives and officers from the Los Angeles and airport police departments served warrants and seized property Wednesday night at 25 different locations, including the airport itself and in Los Angeles-area cities, including Inglewood and Paramount.

Crimes: The contracted workers (none of whom were technically airport employees or TSA workers like those pictured) allegedly stole travelers bags or took things from the suitcases

The suspects reportedly both took entire bags and stole from inside luggage after it had been loaded off arriving planes.

'We believe that there has been a culture of being able to take property that wasn't theirs, and that's what we want to be able to put a stop to,'Captain Ray Maltez told KABC-TV.

Television news footage showed police raiding airport terminals and leading out several people in handcuffs, many of them wearing yellow reflective safety vests.

Most of the police activity was at the Tom Bradley International Terminal and at Terminal 4, which houses American Airlines, American Eagle and some Qantas flights.

Police set up a mobile command center and jail near the airport to process those arrested.

The raids were first reported by KNBC-TV.
