Big spender: European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, pictured today, who is presiding over huge budget rises while Britain and other countries cut back their own

British taxpayers face paying millions of pounds more for ‘pointless’ EU quangos after Brussels planned a massive budget increase of 33 per cent over two years.

Overall, the cost of 52 agencies and committees – such as the Community Plant Variety Office – is set to rise to £2.17billion if the European Commission plan is approved.

And because Britain pays 13 per cent of the budget, taxpayers in this country would therefore be hit with a bill of £298million this year.

The news came as UK Treasury Chief 
Secretary Danny Alexander announced that government departments at home 
will have to find even more cuts.

Pawel
Swidlicki, a research analyst for the Open Europe think-tank, said: 'While some of these EU quangos perform valuable work, many others serve
no practical purpose whatsoever apart from soaking up taxpayers’ money.

'Ironically,
many of these bodies would never have survived the type of austerity 
programmes that the EU is now drawing up for member states as Europe 
fights through its worst crisis in a generation.'

The think-tank has identified at least ten agencies that serve no unique purpose and ought to be abolished.

It claims that many others are duplicating work and suggests that the remaining 42 agencies have their budgets cut by 30 per cent.

This would save EU member states just over £566million every year, with Britain keeping an extra £82million to spend on more worthwhile causes.

The number of quangos has rapidly grown from just three in 1990 to 52 today. The number doubled in just seven years alone from 2004 to last year.

The total cost to European taxpayers now stands is set to rise 3.4 per cent from last year and a massive 33.2 per cent compared with 2010, if the Commission’s budget is approved.

Over 90 per cent of the cost comes from the 27 EU member states – with Germany’s contribution of £400million the highest, followed by France (£315million) and Britain.

The rest of the budget is made up from non-EU member states such as Norway.

Open Society pointed out that there are currently two EU agencies specifically dedicated to human rights in addition to similar bodies in member states, the Council of Europe, the ECHR, a specific EU Commissioner for 'fundamental rights' and a range of NGOs.

The think-tank also claims in its report that there is no evidence that the £105million-a-year Economic and Social Committee, an “advisory” body that has existed since the 1950s, has actually altered the outcome of an EU proposal in recent years, and yet it remains in place.

As an evaluation for the European Commission concluded, the system of EU agencies also “creates an indirect but powerful incentive for spending” taxpayers’ cash.

For example, the European Environment Agency (EEA) paid a consultancy firm £200,000 in order to assess its own media coverage.

The EEA also spent £250,000 on a ‘living map’ of Europe, created from 5,000 plants affixed to the outside wall of its headquarters in Copenhagen in order to promote biodiversity.

The facade stayed up for around five months in 2010. On its website, the EEA said it wanted to 'illustrate the significance of vertical gardens'.

Each board meeting of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – whose mandate already overlaps with that of another EU agency, and whose board only consists of 15 people – costs €92,630 on average, working out at €6,175 per member.

In another study, the Economic Research Council pointed to the Community Plant Variety Office, which is given a £10million-a-year grant, as one of the most pointless

A report explained that: ‘This agency effectively licenses and manages Intellectual Property rights to new types of plants and crops across the EU.

‘Protecting IP is important, but there’s no good reason why this role could not be performed by national IP agencies (like the the UK’s Intellectual Property Office), which could even compete with each other to bring down costs – currently between €1,200 and € 2,400 per examination fee per plant.’
