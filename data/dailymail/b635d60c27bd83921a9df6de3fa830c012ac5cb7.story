Almost half of Britons complain about soaring bills - but cannot be bothered to look for a better deal, research reveals.

At least 45 per cent of bill-payers feel their potential savings wouldn't be worth the change, while one in four said they can face the 'hassle'.

The poll by regulator Ofgem follows research that the majority of Britons are baffled by highly-complicated energy tariffs.

At least 45 per cent of Britons feels the potential savings wouldn't be worth the hassle of shopping around

The complex combination of standing charges, kilowatt hours and unit prices leaves most of us baffled.

This is despite reforms after the ‘big six’ energy firms were ordered by Ofgem to cut the number of tariffs and deals to help families find the best value.

Launching a campaign to encourage people to shop around for deals, Ofgem today insisted changes have made the industry 'simpler, clearer and fairer'.

The Be An Energy Shopper campaign includes a consumer guide on the goenergyshopping.co.uk website to help people find the best energy tariff.

Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'We shop and compare prices for many things in life, yet we often don't think to do the same when it comes to our energy bills, even when we could be saving around £200.

'Previously, people found it difficult to compare tariffs and the process too time consuming but the recent reforms have changed things for the better.

'With the introduction of Be An Energy Shopper it has never been easier to go energy shopping and get a better deal on your gas and electricity.'

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'Making the switch is easier than ever before, and the Be An Energy Shopper campaign gives consumers practical advice on how to shop around and get the best deal for their energy use.

'Having made the switch myself, I would encourage anyone who hasn't already done so to check whether their current supplier is giving them the best deal - and if it isn't, switch.

'We're working to make the energy market work better for consumers.

'We've trebled the number of suppliers since 2010, made people's bills easier to understand, reduced the complexity of tariffs and promoted competition through initiatives such as collective switching. We want consumers to get the benefits of more competition.'
