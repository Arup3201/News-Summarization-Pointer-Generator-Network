Morally wrong: Mike Penning MP said it is wrong that so many people get welfare payments 'for life'

Only 6 per cent of new disability benefit claimants have a face-to-face assessment with a medic, it has been revealed.

Disability minister Mike Penning said it is morally wrong that so many people get welfare payments ‘for life’ based on a form they often fill in themselves.

Mr Penning, appointed to Iain Duncan Smith’s department last week, claimed Labour tried to ‘control unemployment’ by putting people on disability benefits.

This month, the Government will start 
to reassess disability living allowance (DLA) claimants for a new 
benefit called personal independence payment, which includes an 
assessment and regular reviews.

The plans have been attacked by medical charities and disability groups, who say they cause uncertainty for claimants.

But ministers say without reform, by 2018 one in 17 people would be claiming a benefit designed for those unable to walk.

The number on DLA was set to rise to 3.6million by 2015, up from 1.1million when it was created in 1992. There are currently 3.3million claimants,
 costing more than £13billion a year – close to the Department for 
Transport’s total budget.

Government statistics show that in the 12 months to March, just 6 per cent of new DLA claimants had a face-to-face assessment with a healthcare professional, with 94 per cent receiving it on the basis of  a claim form, sometimes with  evidence such as a GP’s note.

That equates to some £250million a year given to new claimants with no face-to-face medical checks.

The
 figures also show 55 per cent of decisions are made on a claim form 
alone, without any additional corroborating medical evidence.

Mr
 Penning said: ‘We can’t just leave people and say “you’ve filled a form
 in, sent it off and that means you’re on the benefit for life”.

‘It’s not fair on them and it’s not fair on the taxpayer – or those  people with disabilities who need more help.’

He said it was absurd not to have regular
 check-ups, since only 3 per cent of people with disabilities are born 
with them and many conditions change over time.

‘Under the personal independence payment, claimants will have a face-to-face assessment and systematic reviews – something missing in the current system – to make sure they’re getting the right levels of support. This is about making the benefit sustainable,’ he added.

Mr Penning said around 170,000 people are likely to lose disability benefit by the next election, but up to 150,000 of the most severely disabled will get more support.

‘We expect to find a large number of people who have been incorrectly assessed,’ he said. Though DLA can be claimed by those in work, the minister said he believed people had been shoved on to a range of sickness and disability benefits to stop them claiming unemployment handouts.

‘In my view this was the way Labour was trying to control unemployment,’ he said. ‘That might keep the unemployment statistics down but it also writes people off.’

The new assessment, initially only given to first-time claimants, looks at everyday activities such as washing, cooking and getting around.

It also examines reading, verbal communication and how someone engages with other people, one reason why ministers claim it will do a better job of recognising certain mental health conditions. Under DLA, 71 per cent of claimants get indefinite awards, without systematic reassessments. But those on personal independence payment will face regular checks.

The DLA system overpays some claimants £630million every year, while others are underpaid by £190million, figures show.

Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has led criticism of the changes, arguing they will hit the vulnerable. She said many disabled people – such as those who are paralysed or are amputees – are ‘not suddenly going to get better’.
