Tottenham winger Iago Falque is expected to complete a £4m move to Italian club Genoa.

The 24-year-old Spaniard scored from the spot in Spurs' recent 3-3 pre-season friendly draw against Seattle Sounders, but Mauricio Pochettino has deemed him surplus to requirements.

Falque joined Tottenham in 2011 on loan from Juventus, before signing a permanent deal the following January.

But he has failed to make much of an impact in his three years in North London, appearing in just one Premier League game.

He also had loan stints at Southampton, as well as Spanish clubs Almeria and Rayo Vallecano.

Falque follows Jake Livermore, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Heurelho Gomes out of White Hart Lane this summer.
