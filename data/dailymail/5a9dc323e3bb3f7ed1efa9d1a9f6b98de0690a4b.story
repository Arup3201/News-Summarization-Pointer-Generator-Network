A $50 portable media player is
providing many North Koreans a window to the outside world
despite the government's efforts to keep its people isolated - a
symbol of change in one of the world's most repressed societies.

By some estimates, up to half of all urban North Korean
households have an easily concealed 'notel', a small portable
media player used to watch DVDs or content stored on USB sticks
that can be easily smuggled into the country and passed hand to
hand.

People are exchanging South Korean soaps, pop music,
Hollywood films and news programmes, all of which are expressly
prohibited by the Pyongyang regime, according to North Korean
defectors, activists and recent visitors to the isolated
country.

Notel or 'notetel' - the name is a uniquely North Korean - a word combining 'notebook' and 'television' - are easily found onthe black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48)

'The North Korean government takes their national ideology
extremely seriously, so the spread of all this media that
competes with their propaganda is a big and growing problem for
them,' said Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), an
organisation that works with defectors.

'If Pyongyang fails to successfully adapt to these trends,
they could threaten the long-term survival of the regime
itself.'

North Koreans have been spending money more openly, a sign
that some forms of entrepreneurship are increasingly tolerated
and that the state is easing some of its harsh controls over the
economy. In recent months, consumption has become more
conspicuous.

'The variety and number of places for locals to spend money
has really increased,' said one regular visitor to Pyongyang,
declining to be identified. 

'People seem a lot more confident
flashing the cash than they used to be. I've seen people spend
$500 on a phone with no hesitation, for example.'

There is no sign, however, that the regime in
nuclear-capable North Korea is loosening its grip, looking to
make substantial reforms or making any change in its
unpredictable ways of dealing with the outside world.

But along with rising incomes, more goods are available in
the impoverished country, mostly on the black market but also in
some state-controlled stores.

Notel or 'notetel' - the name is a uniquely North Korean
word combining 'notebook' and 'television' - are easily found on
the black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48), and are 
also available in some state shops and markets.

The device was legalised last year, according to
defector-run news outlets in Seoul - one of many recent measures
taken by the state to accommodate grassroots change.

The new rules, however, also require North Koreans to
register their notel, enabling authorities to monitor who is
most likely to be watching banned foreign media.

North Koreans do not have access to the internet - those who
can go online are limited to a state-run intranet, while the
country's 2.5 million mobile phone subscribers are not allowed
to call outside the country.

The notel comes from China, either smuggled or legally
imported.

Lee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled
18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year. 

He said he
ordered them directly from a factory in Guangzhou that was
likely still in production solely to satisfy the demands of the
North Korean market.

The devices have lost their popularity in China over the
years, but still sell well in the provinces bordering North
Korea, according to data on the China-based online shopping
website Taobao.

When asked to quote a wholesale price for notel, one Chinese
trader in the border city of Yanji said: 'You want to send them
to North Korea? How many do you want to send? They sell well
there.'

Lee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year.

The low-voltage notel differs from the portable DVD players
of the late 1990s in that they have USB and SD card ports, and a
built-in TV and radio tuner. 

They can also be charged with a car
battery - an essential piece of household equipment in
electricity-scarce North Korea.

Legally-registered notel must be fixed to official state
television and radio channels, according to the Daily NK, a
Seoul-based news organisation run by defectors.

Lee, the defector, said the device's multi-function nature
makes it easier for users to get away with watching illegal
material.

'To avoid getting caught, people load a North Korean DVD
while watching South Korean dramas on a USB stick, which can be
pulled out,' he said.

'They then tell the authorities, who feel
the heat from the notel to check whether or not it has been
recently used, that they were watching North Korean films'.

Park at the LiNK organisation added: 'They are small enough
to roll up in a blanket and hide in a wardrobe. They have become
so popular because they are perfect for overcoming the twin
barriers to foreign media consumption: surveillance and power
outages.

'If you were to design the perfect device for North Koreans,
it would be this.'
