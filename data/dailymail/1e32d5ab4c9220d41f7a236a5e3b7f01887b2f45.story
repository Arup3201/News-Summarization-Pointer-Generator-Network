The Duke of Edinburgh made the Queen cry with his ‘almost brutal’ attitude when she refused to take his surname of Mountbatten, a  biography claims.

It says the Queen ‘failed to see that her actions would have a profound effect on Philip, leading to strains in their marriage’.

And it even suggests that the ten-year delay between the births of the Princess Royal and the Duke of York may have been the result of ‘Philip’s anger over the Queen’s rejection of his family name’.

The irritation he felt over his wife’s decision to accept the advice of then Prime Minister Winston Churchill and keep the family name Windsor is detailed in Sally Bedell Smith’s book, Elizabeth the Queen.

The Duke wanted the Royal Family to be known as the House of Mountbatten when the Queen came to the throne in 1952. He is famously said to have told friends: ‘I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children. I’m nothing but a bloody amoeba.’

In an article in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine, Miss Bedell Smith has written of how in 1960 the Queen, heavily pregnant with the Duke of York, told Harold Macmillan she needed to ‘revisit the issue of her family  name, which had been irritating her husband since she decided  in 1952 to use Windsor rather  than Mountbatten’.

Marital debate: The book says that the Queen was left 'in tears' over the issue

The then Prime Minister wrote in his 
diary: ‘The Queen only wishes (properly enough) to do something to 
please her husband – with whom she is desperately in love.

‘What upsets me… is the Prince’s almost brutal attitude to the Queen over all this.’  

Deputy Prime Minister Rab Butler and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, 
were assigned the task of resolving the Queen’s ‘tricky’ family problem.

In a telegram, Butler told Macmillan the Queen had ‘absolutely set her 
heart’ on making a change for Philip’s sake.

Miss Bedell Smith, whose 
book is to be published in February, said: ‘By one account, Butler 
confided to a friend that Elizabeth had been “in tears”.’ 

Following discussions, it was agreed that the Royal Family would continue to be called ‘the House and Family of Windsor’.

But the Queen’s ‘de-royalised’ descendants, starting with any 
grandchildren who lacked the designation of ‘royal highness’, would 
adopt the surname ‘Mountbatten- Windsor’.

In a statement on February 8, 1960, the Queen said she ‘has had this in mind for a long time and it is close to her heart’.

‘It seemed clear cut’, Miss Bedell Smith said.

But, 13 years later, ‘Princess Anne....would contravene the policy on 
her wedding day by signing the marriage register as 
“Mountbatten-Windsor”’.

The biography also gives an insight into the lighter side of royal life.
It tells of the joy at the news that the Queen’s first child, Prince 
Charles, was a boy.

Sir John Weir, an official physician to the Royal Family, confided  that
he had ‘never been so pleased’ to see a boy born, Miss Bedell Smith 
writes.
