The new waxwork figure of Jane Austen, which has gone on display at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath

Her face may not be as familiar as her books, but that could soon change.

This waxwork shows what Jane Austen may have looked like –according to a former FBI forensic artist who helped make it.

The Pride and Prejudice author never sat for an official portrait – she was sketched only once, by her sister Cassandra in 1810 – so the Jane Austen Centre in Bath, asked painter and researcher Melissa Dring to create the first realistic likeness.

She spent 18 months trawling diaries, letters and other documents for information, before royal sculptor Mark Richards used her findings to build the 5ft 6in waxwork.

Miss Dring, who trained in composite art with the FBI, used diaries, letters and written accounts for any snippet of information about her physical appearance.

Royal sculptor Mark Richards then brought her research to life and created the 5ft 6ins waxwork which was unveiled yesterday.

Miss Dring said: ‘In the drawing Cassandra made, it really doesn't reflect the fun, witty, amusing person that all written accounts of her seem to portray - this really lovely girl.

‘From all the accounts I looked through, I tried to reflect someone who would sit there plotting her next book.’

She added: ‘It was so interesting to find out whatever I could from reading different bits and whatever I could about her.’

Austen lived between 1775 and 1817, moving to Bath in 1800 and on to Chawton in 1809 before her death.

The artist said that Austen's family all seemed to share the same long nose, brown eyes and curly brown hair

The only authenticated sketch of her was produced in 1810 by her sister Cassandra, drawn in pencil and watercolours and depicting her sitting in a chair.

Since then portraits have been produced but these are only interpretations of Cassandra's original image - including the images of Austen on the £10 note.

Miss Dring, who trained as a portrait painter at the Royal Academy of Arts and has worked as Police Forensic artist with the FBI in America, also took into account family traits.

‘She came from a large Austen family and they all seemed to share the long nose, the bright sparkly brown eyes and curly brown hair,’ she said.

‘And these characteristics come through the generations.’
