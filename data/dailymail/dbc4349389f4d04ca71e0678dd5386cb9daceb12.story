No one expects to unearth histories of love while looking for a rice cooker. But for one couple, this helped them discover that their relationship started much earlier than they previously thought. 

Through finding a preschool class photograph, the couple realized they had actually met 16 years previously, when they were three years old. 

While at his girlfriend's house, believed to be in the U.S., Reddit user Evanaka1234 came across an old school photo of her and recognized her immediately, claiming that she looked like an 'imp'.

Reddit user Evanaka found this preschool class photo in his girlfriend's house while trying to find a rice cooker

He recognized his girlfriend immediately, but then realized the boy next to her looked familiar as well. He then discovered that the boy next to his girlfriend was him and that the couple had unknowingly gone to preschool together

But as he stared at the photo he realized the blond boy next to his girlfriend, who has not been named, looked familiar. 

Then it hit him: The little boy next to his girlfriend was him. 

He couldn't believe it, so he called his mom, who confirmed the name of his preschool, which was in fact the school his girlfriend went to, even though neither of them remember it.  

Evanaka1234 posted the picture on Reddit, sharing his story with the world. 

Sixteen years later the couple are together again, except as a couple rather than classmates. It is unknown how long the couple has been dating. 

Daily Mail Online tried to reach out to Evanaka1234, but did not get a response. 

Earlier this week a couple in New Jersey announced that home video from 1988 has revealed they had actually crossed paths 16 years before they were set up on a blind date.

Jourdan Barovick was 10 when she was being filmed by her parents coming down a waterslide in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.

A boy in glasses aged 13 walks across the video- it is her future husband, Ryan Spencer. In a strange coincidence Ryan and Jourdan were introduced by 16 years later on a blind date and are now married with three children.
