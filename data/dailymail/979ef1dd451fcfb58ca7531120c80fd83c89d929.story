A surge in digital payments has seen more parents opting to digitally transfer pocket-money to their children.

But a new study from Commonwealth Bank has revealed less than one in ten parents feel their child fully understands the value of digital money.  

The research found a further one in three children doesn't understand where digital money comes from, while one third of parents agree that digital purchases make it harder to teach children the value of money.

It also revealed the amount of pocket money being given to children  per week has risen since 2013 , with the average child now receiving $10.36, up from $10.17.

Holly Clarke, a mother of three from north Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia she started giving her six-year-old daughter Beatrix an allowance last year.

'I started a Commonwealth Bank Dollarmite account and we give her three dollars a week. She deposits it into an account through a banking program at Roseville school,' said Ms Clarke.

'I think it's very important for kids to experience the physical transaction of money. I don't see the point in digitally transferring them an allowance- there is no learning that way.'

'Kids don't understand if they want you to buy an app it costs money. They don't understand that digital money is finite,' she said.  

Ms Clarke said she doesn't see the point in digitally transferring children an allowance since they will not learn the value of the money

Her mother Holly said Beatrix doe snot see digital currency as a finite resource and rather that it is specific to online transactions

Mrs Clarke said Beatrix still has little awareness of digital currency, and that is why she has chosen to give her allowance in hard currency.

'She still doesn't fully realise its money in her bank account. Most kids her age don't see digital money as hard currency. They think it's specific to online transactions.' 

Veronica Howarth, Head of School Banking and Youth at Commonwealth Bank, said there is a growth in parents opting to digitally transfer their children's allowance.

'There are now around 14 per cent of parents are now paying their parents through online transfer,' she said.

'Our study found that sitting with children while transferring them pocket money can be a good way to communicate the value of money, but the research suggest it will limit their understanding. 

'There is still a requirement from kids to teach them the traditional forms of currency,' she said.

In a bid to teach children the value of money, Commonwealth Bank will invest $50 million over three years to expand financial education programs.

The bank has launched an initiative to double the reach of StartSmart, their financial education workshops which were launched eight years ago, by 2016.

Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev, said 'just as technology is changing our business, it is changing the way children can, and need to, learn about money.'
