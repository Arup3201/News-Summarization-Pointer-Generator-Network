Steven Gerrard was confirmed as an LA Galaxy player on Wednesday, but supporters of the MLS club will have to wait until July to see him with the shirt.

LA Galaxy announced the signing of the former England international before Gerrard gave an interview to Galaxy TV where he insisted he wasn't joining the California-based club for a holiday. 

‘Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,’ said Gerrard. ‘I’m not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. 'I’m going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable.

What Gerrard could look like for LA Galaxy in MLS in our mocked-up picture

‘I still feel like a player. I still feel like I can perform for a number of years, so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality — a team that is used to winning but also a team that’s got people that want to win in the future.

‘Having spoken to the manager Bruce Arena and also the people above him, they’re very aggressive and they want success.

‘That’s what I want. That’s how I want to finish my career, so they are the reasons I chose LA Galaxy. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.’ 

Gerrard remain a Liverpool player for the next six months and the midfielder stopped short of posing for photos holding Galaxy's shirt, presumably out of respect for the Reds supporters.

Galaxy fans will have to wait until Gerrard makes the move to Los Angeles in the summer to see their new hero donning the white strip, where he will undoubtedly be officially presented to supporters amid much fanfare.

My next team is going to be La Galaxy. I'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that's the team I will join at the end of the season.

Their pursuing me was very aggressive. The talks Ive had with them are very positive, they basically told me what I wanted to hear. They told me about the winning mentality of the club, their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so I will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there.

There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are locateed as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different. It's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that I go there and it's a success on the pitch and then hopefully I can enjoy it off the pitch as well.

The big challenge is going to be settling in, I've lived in Liverpool all my life. I'm a Scouser through and through. I love my City. I love my roots. But, you only get one life, it's important to try different things and experiences and it's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well.

It's perfect timing for this new challenge. I'm really excited and looking forward to it, but I've still got a few things that I've got to try and achieve before I go so my focus is on that. There will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move.

It's the right time for a new challenge, a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too. I'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the US. I've watched a lot of their games and I also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and I've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career I believe the timing is right to move on.

I still feel like a player, I still feel like I can perform for a number of years so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality - a team that is used to winning but also a team that's got people within there that want to win in the future. 

I know the players have got a winning mentality, they've proved it over a number of years. Having spoken to the manager, Bruce Arena, and also the people above him - they're very aggressive and they want success and that's what I want. That's how I want to finish my career so they are the reasons that I chose LA Galaxy.

I'd like to think I've got the same attitude as the people that have tried to make this signing happen - the manager, the CEO and the owner - they all seem to me to be like winners and that is how I see myself. 

I'm very professional and go about my work to a good standard on a daily basis. I like to try and find consistency. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.

What I can guarantee is that I will go there and work hard and I will make sacrifices and be dedicated to perform at a consistent level and hopefully play my part in success for this team.

Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years. I'm not going over here for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I am going over here to win and if I win and play well then my life becomes more enjoyable.

My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. It's been a privilege to play for them and represent them for all these years and I will continue to do that until the end of the season and I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season. And hopefully come back - that's the message, my relationship with Liverpool doesn't end in the summer. In fact it will never end.

For the new team I am going to, I will come over there with the same attitude which 110 per cent every day - be professional, makes sacrifices and try and contribute. I like to think I'm a team player and I will play my part to try and help the team.
