A Manchester high school has been ridiculed for erecting a sign boasting of its students' achievements in English only for the poster itself to contain a glaring spelling error.

Chorlton High School placed the huge sign at the front of the school to celebrate its students' 2014 GCSE success rates in English and Mathematics.

But what staff didn't realise was that the sign claimed 67 percent of students had 'ganied' good GCSEs in the two subjects.

Chorlton High School admitted there had been a 'slip up' with the spelling and said it was being corrected

Next to the embarrassing banner were other posters - all spelt perfectly - which described the school as 'a centre of excellence for the arts' and boasted of its position within the top 100 schools for the greatest 'sustained improvement in GCSE results'.

One bemused onlooker, who did not wish to be named, described it as 'unbelievable'.

He said: 'It must have been pretty recent because there were workmen looking at it trying to take it down.

'They're bragging about their success in English and Maths but there's a spelling mistake. It's unbelievable.

'I was shocked. Going back to your school days you are told "check, double check" and in the days of computer spell checking - it's amazing.

'The fact that the sign is obviously bragging about their success in English, it's ironic that they've put a spelling mistake there.

'I'm sure the school is going to blame the printers and the printers are going to blame the school.' 

 The irony of the spelling error was not lost on Twitter users who were quick to share photos of the sign

It wasn't long before other eagle-eyed locals spotted the error and quickly shared it on social media.

James Swift tweeted: Chorlton High School excelling at spelling as well as exam results. Some proof reading gone amiss here.'

Matt Burney responded: 'Wow... not really much to be said there!'

After being approached by MailOnline, a spokesman for the school admitted there had been a 'slip-up'.

He said: 'This was obviously a slip-up, which we are correcting, but it shouldn't detract from our students' achievements.'
