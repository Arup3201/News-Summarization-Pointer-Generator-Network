Mathieu Debuchy looks destined for Arsenal after the Newcastle United right-back favourited a tweet saying that he will be hopefully unveiled as a Gunner soon.

The France star also removed any mention of Newcastle from his Twitter bio as he moves closer to the exit door at St James' Park.

Speculation has surrounded Debuchy's future since the end of last season when he seemed to signal his farewell to Toon supporters by staying longer than his team-mates to clap the fans after their last-day defeat to Liverpool at Anfield.

Question marks: Debuchy's future on Tyneside has been in doubt since the end of the season

Ready for business: Newcastle have been made aware of Arsenal's interest in the full-back

And the 28-year-old seems certain to 
leave after he favourited a tweet that read: '@Arsenal @MatDebuchy 
hopefully soon to be unveiled.'

He also removed the mention of 'NUFC' that was previously on his Twitter bio.

Arsenal are believed to be pressing ahead with an £11million move for Debuchy following the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City on a free transfer this summer.

Debuchy, currently with France at the World Cup in Brazil, is emerging as the 
leading candidate to replace his countryman in the Gunners back-four 
next season and a deal is believed to be close.

However, a deal is unlikely to be concluded until after France's World Cup participation is over.

Les Bleus face Germany in the quarter-finals on Friday at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.
