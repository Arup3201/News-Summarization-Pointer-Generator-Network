Kato Kaelin, a star witness at the O.J. Simpson trial, has backtracked saying that he never confirmed  the disgraced former football star killed his ex-wife.

In a recent interview, Kaelin, who gave 
evidence for four days in front of millions glued to their TVs, said 
Simpson was guilty of butchering Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend 
Ronald Goldman - but that he was 'too scared' to say so during the 1994 
hearing.

However Kato has now flip-flopped on these reported statements and told TMZ: 'I would never say something like this... I have no first hand knowledge.'

He said he was shocked by the interview with the New York Post and that it did not take place.

Sensational trial: Nicole Brown Simpson was suspected of being killed by ex-husband O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, California, in June 1995

Kaelin allegedly told the New York Post’s Cindy Adams: 'The statute of limitations has now passed... so I can now say... yes, he did it.'

Asked why he let Simpson get away with it, he said: 'I was too scared. I was terrified.'

The bodies of Brown Simpson and Goldman were found at her home, the victims of a vicious knife attack in front of her Los Angeles condominium.

Over the years, Kaelin's claims implied that O.J. Simpson could know more details about the case that have not yet become public.

Victim: Ronald Goldman was found murdered along with his friend Nicole Brown Simpson in 1994

Simpson starred in dozens of film and TV roles both during and after his NFL career, and was most famous for his three-film stint as Detective Nordberg in the 'Naked Gun' series.

For 17 years, doubt has hung over his innocence despite the acquittal, and a $33.5million civil case later found him liable for her death and the death of Goldman.

At the trial, Kaelin, a small-time actor and Simpson's house-guest on the night of the killing, became an oddball celebrity after his rambling testimony about Simpson's movements and some background information.

He was lampooned on TV shows for his long hair, laid-back surfer demeanor and for being an unemployed layabout.

Critics claim that he held back from telling the jury about Simpson’s bouts of rage or his possessiveness of his ex-wife.

His
 testimony was so inconsistent that at one point, prosecutor Marcia 
Clark asked for permission from Judge Lance to to treat him as a 
hostile witness.

He then admitted that Simpson had acted 'upset' in the hours before his ex-wife and Goldman were killed.

Simpson is currently serving in a Nevada prison for his role in a Las Vegas robbery case.

He was convicted of being the leader 
of an armed group that raided a hotel room at the Palace Station hotel 
in 2007 and robbed a pair of sports memorabilia dealers.

Though
 Simpson said that he was only taking back what was rightfully his and 
claimed no weapons were used, he was sentenced to 33 years in jail on 
October 8, 2008 - 13 years to the day of his 1995 acquittal.

Many saw the especially harsh sentence as retribution for getting off scot-free in the killings.

The Simpson case recently returned to the headlines when one of the original prosecutors alleged that the lead defense lawyer tampered with a crucial piece of evidence.

Former Los Angeles deputy district attorney Christopher Darden accused the late Johnnie Cochran of 'manipulating' one of the infamous gloves that the prosecution said linked Simpson to the crime.

After Simpson struggled to fit the gloves on his hands - in one of the defining moments of the racially-charged trial that captivated the nation - Cochran famously admonished the jury: 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.'

Following Simpson’s acquittal Kaelin, 53, skirted around the edges of celebrity and became a failed reality TV star, appearing in shows like 'Celebrity Boot Camp.'

He filmed episodes of a series called 'House Guest' in which he would stay in the homes of various celebrities, but the show never saw the light of day.

Kaelin also appeared as a contestant on quiz shows and briefly worked in radio.

O.J. Simpson was sentenced on 12 charges, including felony kidnapping, armed robbery and conspiracy related to a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel

O.J. Simpson: A former football star whose career spanned 11 seasons with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers. He had turned to acting both during and after his football career, and his most famous role was as Detective Nordberg in the ‘Naked Gun’ films opposite Leslie Nielson. He was famously acquitted of the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1995, but ordered to pay their families 33.5million in damages in a subsequent wrongful death civil trial. On October 8, 2008 - 13 years to the day of his 1995 acquittal, he was found guilty in a Las Vegas armed robbery case and sentenced to 33 years in jail. He will be eligible for parole in 2017.

Judge Lance Ito: Ito worked in the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office before he was appointed to the job of Superior Court judge in 1989. But he wasn’t internationally recognised until he sat on the bench at the O.J. Simpson murder trial. He regularly declines invitations to be interviewed about the case. Today, Ito continues to hold the post of Superior Court judge. The LA Times reported in 2009 that Ito's notoriety because of the Simpson case prompted thieves to repeatedly steal the placard bearing his name from outside the courtroom so often that Ito will no longer replace it.

Johnnie Cochran: While many figures of the O.J. Simpson trial became national figures in the trial itself, Cochran was already notorious in California as a skilled lawyer with a wide variety of celebrity clients to his name. Among them were Michael Jackson, rapper Tupac Shakur and Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs. Cochran also represented police brutality victim Abner Louima in New York. He famously uttered the term 'If the glove don't fit, you must acquit' to jurors during the Simpson trial in reference to the bloody glove found at the murder scene. In the hit TV show Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer’s attorney Jackie Chiles is loosely based on Cochran. Cochrane died of a brain tumor in 2005.

Marcia Clark: Clark was active for several years as a prosecutor before she unsuccessfully tried to put Simpson away in 1995 for the murder of Brown Simpson and Goldman. She penned a book about the Simpson case, called Without a Doubt, in 1997. It was released right after she resigned as a prosecutor. Last year, she was back on TV to provide legal analysis for Healdine News on the trial of Casey Anthony, the Florida mother who was accused of murdering her young daughter Caylee. In a 2011 Daily Beast column she wrote after Anthony's murder acquittal, Clark branded her 'Worse Than OJ!'

Robert Kardashian: Before his children Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob Kardashian became fixtures on reality television, Robert Kardashian was Simpson's close friend and lawyer during his murder trial. His ex-wife Kris (who later went on to marry Olympics icon Bruce Jenner) was equally as close with Nicole Brown Simpson. O.J. stayed in Kardashian's home in the days after the murder - just before the famous Ford Bronco chase. He joined Simpson's defense team despite not having practiced law in several years. Kardashian, who was married three times, was just 59 years old when he died of esophageal cancer in 2003.

Robert Shapiro: Another one of Simpson’s high-priced attorneys, Robert Shapiro has a long list of celebrity clients to his name - from athletes like Jose Canseco and Darryl Strawberry to TV stars like Johnny Carson and the Kardashian family. In 2001, he co-founded the online legal documentation site LegalZoom.com. He also stepped into the fashion realm in 2009 when he co-founded ShoeDazzle.com. He continues to represent clients like Eva Longoria and casino tycoon Steve Wynn.                                     

Mark Fuhrman: The LA detective who was branded a liar and racist by O.J. Simpson’s defense team may no longer be on the force, but he's still keeping busy. Several years after the O.J. Simpson trial, Fuhrman published a book about the long-unsolved murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut. Fuhrman alleged that the killer was Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel. In 2002, Skakel was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Fuhrman now provides crime commentary for Fox News.

Original testimony was so much on Simpson’s side that the prosecution labelled him a hostile witness

@highlight

Now he says he was sure of Simpson's guilt but was 'too scared' to say

@highlight

Admission means he could know details about the case which have not yet been made public
