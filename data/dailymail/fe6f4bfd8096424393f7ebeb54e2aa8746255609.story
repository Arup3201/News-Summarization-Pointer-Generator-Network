They say an Englishman’s home is his castle and for the princely sum of £250,000 you could make it a reality.

An incredible property that looks like a miniature castle has come on the market - for just that sum.

The Grade II listed building, located in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, was erected in 1720 and features an amazing turret that boasts countryside and harbour views.

It was originally used as a watch tower and the rest of the building was used as an office by the harbour master.

The building, which was converted to residential use about 70 years ago, was built around 1720 and it is known locally as the Tower House or the Octagon

Although the building doesn't quite offer the same space a true castle would, its battlement style parapets and medieval-type features will be sure to attract history fans

The tiny urban castle, listed for £250,000, boasts four bedrooms, an open plan kitchen, a spacious living room as well as views for miles on a clear day

Although experts are unsure how long the ancient building was used by the local port authority, it is believed that around 70 years ago it was converted for residential use.

The building boasts four bedrooms, an open plan kitchen and dining room, and a spacious living room.

It also has a yard at the back and is just a stone’s throw away from the stunning coastal walk surrounding Colywell Bay.

Don't let its modern interior fool you - the two storey building also has a turret on the second level, from where you can stand and look out across the neighborhood

The turret was originally used as a watchtower looking over the surrounding countryside while the rest of the building was used as the harbourmaster's office

The property is being sold through Next2Buy estate agents who are based in Tyneside.

Karen Blight, sales negotiator at Next2Buy, said: 'This property was built around 1720 and it is known as the Tower House or the Octagon.

'It was built to look out to sea and it was designed by architect John Vanbrughand. It was used as a small harbour office.

'It has been used for residential purposes for the last 70 years or so but unfortunately we do not know much else about the history of it.

'The most exciting part of the property would be the fantastic view, it’s a beautiful location and when it is clear you can see for miles.

'The turret is accessible and would be a perfect place to stand or sit and look out at the beautiful views, it would be like having your own castle.

The building isn't expected to be big enough for a family, but it does fit in a narrow utility room, left, while the view of the nearby channel is one of winding hills and water

'The house is two storeys high and has three to four bedrooms in the basement area, one bathroom, a living room and an open plan kitchen and dining room.

'What’s interesting about the building is that the whole world has changed around it but it has remained exactly the same after all these years.

'I don’t think it would accomodate a family because it is too small but it would be ideal for someone who is quite passionate about the Northumberland coast.'
