A loving mother was spied on by teachers and accused of making up her child’s autism after she demanded more help in the classroom.

Jenny Lockley was suspected of having Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) – in which sufferers fabricate illness in a child to draw attention to themselves – because she insisted her son Sam had needed support.

Nursery school teachers dismissed three diagnoses of autism, one by a world-renowned doctor, and put the 39-year-old through an  experience she described as a ‘witch hunt’.

'Witch hunt': Mother Jenny Lockley, who faced the accusations with her autistic son Sam and daughter Laura

Mrs Lockley is just one of dozens of parents of autistic children who have contacted The Mail on Sunday saying teachers or social workers have accused them of fabricating their offspring’s disorder.

This is despite statistics showing there are only about 64 cases a year in Britain of MSBP, while one in 100 children are thought to be autistic.

In some cases children have been put on the child protection register – meaning the authorities believe them to be at ‘serious risk of harm’.

In a few, parents even claim their children have been taken away from them and wrongly put into care.

Almost 800 people have signed an internet petition calling on the National Autistic Society to act against the accusations being used as a ‘bullying tactic’ by schools and local authorities.

Mrs Lockley, a single mother-of-two from Solihull, West Midlands, said: ‘This scandal has to be exposed before more damage is done.’

She was never told she was being investigated as a ‘Münchausen’s mum’ – and only found out after she demanded council documents about herself using the Freedom of Information Act.

Secret meetings: Staff at Lady Katherine Leveson School in Solihull, West Midlands, watched Mrs Lockley coming into school with her two children

Lucy and Chris Mallows say they were accused of fabricating their daughter Josie’s autism as a result  of school-gate gossip.

They faced an ‘extremely stressful’ two-week investigation by social services into claims of Münchausen’s Syndrome by Proxy.

When Josie started nursery at her Cheltenham school, the couple informed staff that she had been diagnosed with a form of autism.

But after staff said Josie was fine in nursery, mothers started talking, according to the couple,  and rumours began to circulate that Lucy had invented Josie’s autism.

Worried, the head outlined her concerns in a secret letter to the Mallows’ GP, who passed it on to social services.

Lucy, 34, received a telephone call telling her that she and her husband, 35, were under investigation as the head believed Lucy was ‘seeking attention through the child’.

The case was dropped after the social worker concluded the allegations were baseless.

The Mallows are now moving  to a different area.

Consultant paediatrician  Dr Jo Jones, who diagnosed Josie as autistic, said: ‘The Mallows’ story is appalling.

The school’s concerns were based on a group of trouble-making mothers.’

The headteacher at the school declined to comment.

‘What I discovered horrified me,’ she said.

She learned that staff at Lady Katherine Leveson Church of England Primary School in Solihull secretly watched her coming into school with Sam and older daughter Laura, now 18, in a bid to prove their case.

They also held a secret meeting about her parenting skills during which ‘child protection issues’ were raised.

Mrs Lockley said: ‘I was gutted to find out what they had engaged in, which was basically a witch hunt. My world fell apart.’

She said that problems started when she tried to get Sam, who is now 12, assessed for special needs, only to be told he was fine.

During a six-year battle, she spent £10,000 on private medical reports proving that her son needed extra help, and £14,000 on lawyers to force Solihull Council to fund a place at a private school for autistic children. In 2010, she succeeded.

Carol Povey from the National Autistic Society said: ‘Many families across the country struggle to get a diagnosis of autism for their child, and report that local authorities and professionals can lack the  necessary understanding of the lifelong developmental condition.

In some cases, this can lead to allegations of poor parenting, inappropriate care or even fabrication.

‘It’s vital that assessments are carried out by professionals who have an in-depth understanding of autism.’

A spokesman for Solihull  Borough Council said: ‘We do not comment about the circumstances of individual cases.

‘Lady Katherine Leveson School has been contacted  but does not wish to comment either.’
