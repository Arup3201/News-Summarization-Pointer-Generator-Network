Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the midweek round of fixtures... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week sees reason to celebrate for Kurt Zouma and Harry Kane, but less so for Edin Dzeko.

1 Kurt Zouma’s middle name is Happy – and the young French defender has every right to feel that way after starting to force his way into Jose Mourinho’s thinking. The 20-year-old is emerging as a genuine threat to England centre back Gary Cahill’s place alongside John Terry after getting picked in six of Chelsea’s last nine games. The 1-0 win over Everton was the fourth of those in which Chelsea have kept a clean sheet.

2 Harry Kane is emerging as a candidate to join only three players to have ever collected both the PFA Young Player and Player of the Year awards in the same season. The 21-year-old Spurs striker is already a shoo-in for the Young Player prize after his explosive arrival in Mauricio Pochettino’s team. But if he keeps up his current rate he could well follow former Spurs idol Gareth Bale who won both prizes two years ago. After scoring at Liverpool Kane now has 13 Premier League goals despite not getting a start in the Tottenham side until November. That’s exactly the same number Bale had scored at the same stage of the 2012-13 season – and he’d been a regular in the team.

3 Edin Dzeko scored 26 goals in all competitions for Manchester City last season but now finds himself as the striker with most to fear from Wilfried Bony’s arrival. When £28million new boy Bony gets back from the Africa Cup of Nations it will push the Bosnian striker even further down the pecking order. Hauled off after an hour when City failed to beat Hull on Saturday, he was used only as a sub for the last 17 minutes of the 4-1 win at Stoke and has only once played 90 minutes in the Premier League all season.

4 Tony Pulis might have a reputation for producing committed teams but he also insists on discipline and will want to sort out new signing Callum McManaman. The £4.75million man arrived at West Brom from Wigan with a reputation for reckless tackling, with a red card and five yellows already this campaign. And he was fortunate to escape with only a yellow for a lunging tackle on Swansea’s Jefferson Montero during Albion’s 2-0 win.

5 Graziano Pelle seems to be starting to feel the pace of his first full Premier League season, or maybe defenders have begun to work out the 29-year-old Italian. Pelle exploded on to the scene at Southampton with nine goals in his first 12 matches for Ronald Koeman’s team. But the former Feyenoord striker has now gone eight Premier League games without a goal following the 0-0 draw against 10-man West Ham.

6 Joel Ward spent the early part of the season being switched around the Crystal Palace line-up under Neil Warnock, including a spell when he had to do a job at left back. Since Alan Pardew took over he’s been moved back to his best role at right back and his performances have been one of the keys to Palace’s run of just one defeat in seven games under their new boss. Pardew has kept an unchanged back four in every one of those matches.

7 Many asked why David Moyes didn’t keep Mike Phelan at Manchester United when he took over from Sir Alex Ferguson and the question has even more relevance following his impact at Hull. Apart from a brief spell helping out at Norwich the experienced 52-year-old had been out of work since he followed Fergie out of Old Trafford. But in two matches since Bruce recruited him to halt his team’s slide into the relegation zone Hull have taken four points.

8 Malky Mackay will have to win his next four matches at Wigan to have a better record after 17 matches than the one which got Uwe Rosler the sack in November. Owner Dave Whelan lost patience with Rosler when he’d taken just 16 points from the first 17 games despite signing 11 new players in the summer. Mackay has been allowed to bring in eight fresh faces, but after the 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest has just six points from 13 matches.

9 Nigel Clough has used Sheffield United’s profits from their run to the Capital One Cup wisely in signing Rochdale winger Matt Done. The 26-year-old whose career started at Wrexham then Hereford had 14 goals already this season when he signed for the Blades – and that is now 15 after marking his debut by scoring in the 4-1 win over Colchester. Clough’s side go to League One leaders Bristol City on Saturday with a chance to get into the promotion shake-up. They are in sixth place, but with two games in hand on most of their rivals.

10 Paul Buckle’s return to English football after spending time in America is reaching crisis point at League Two Cheltenham. The 44-year-old built a strong reputation taking Exeter then Torquay to play-off finals, but after flopping at Bristol Rovers and Luton needed a success story when he was put in charge at Whaddon Road following the controversial sacking of long-serving boss Mark Yates. The 2-0 defeat at Southend means he has won only once in 13 games, and the Robins were forced to deny stories he had been sacked in the wake of the defeat.
