It can be the cause of a fair amount of agitation - the passenger next to you on the aeroplane has commandeered the whole of the arm rest.

With a response of casually edging you elbow in, or uncomfortably sliding your arm down the side of your seat, it's not an ideal situation to find yourself in.

But one company may have found an answer to the conundrum - and all it involves is setting up is a plastic divider.

The design, obviously in the shape of a plane, could end the arguments over armrests

Transforming the armrest evenly for two people will be pleasing news for many

Soarigami is a clip-on, origami-style armrest divider that looks like a paper airplane and frees up twice the space of a regular armrest.

The invention also folds easily back into your bag, not taking up valuable space in your cabin luggage allowance.

However, the solution to an everyday problem is not quite there yet - it is still being tested and is not expected to be released until early 2015.

How the Soarigami will be modelled; the paper divider is set to be available early 2015

Grace Chang writes on the Soarigami blog: 'Soarigami was designed to elevate the travel space by getting rid of the fight for armrests. 

'Sick of fighting for armrests, our co-founder sketched the first idea onto a cocktail napkin during a particularly unpleasant flight.

'Sora means sky in Japanese, and gami means graceful. With the product being origami-inspired and meant to be used in flight, the name Soarigami was born, aiming to soar the skies with grace. 

'The Sorigami is a portable, lightweight travel product that ends the fight for elbows.' 

The divider is expected to retail at around £20 ($30).
