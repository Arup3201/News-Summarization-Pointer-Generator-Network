The Marquess of Bath has sparked fears amongst residents on his estate that he is planning to mine under their homes by invoking an ancient right.

The colourful aristocrat claims he has the right to the minerals under vast swathes of west Wiltshire, which he argues dates back to when the title included a much larger area of land.

Much of the land has since been built on or sold off but Lord Bath is claiming his Longleat Estate, which boasts Longleat Zoo, held on to the mineral rights for whatever is underneath the ground.

'Controversial' aristocrat: The Marquess of Bath has raised fears he is planning to frack on his estate after invoking an ancient right. He argues that the rights to the minerals under a vast area of west Wiltshire date back centuries

Council officials have responded by informing worried villagers how to contest the claim and tried to reassure them that fracking or mining is not an immediate concern.

Heather Abernethie, town clerk in Warminster, Wiltshire, said fracking had been raised as a concern because the area is close to the Mendips which has been mooted for possible test drilling.

However, she added that Lord Bath's application is a legal technicality and he would need to be granted a licence to extract gas.

Longleat House (pictured) is on Lord Bath's 9,000 acre estate along with Longleat Zoo. But the aristocrat has applied for mineral rights to a larger area of land they argue was 'vested in the land owner centuries ago'.

'Residents have expressed worries that following recent publicity these letters have been sent out in order for the rights owner to have access to the mineral rights for the purposes of fracking.

'The Land Registry makes it clear that any oil or gas belongs to the Crown, not to the owners of the land, and they would have to grant licences to extract them.'

She explained that until 2002, interests in mines and mineral rights existed but did not need to be recorded on the Land Register.

'However, following the Land Registration Act, the interests needed to be recorded by October 12, 2013, in order to be protected,' she said.

'Longleat believes the interest in the mineral rights has been in the ownership of the family for hundreds of years and has registered this interest accordingly.'

Residents on the Longleat estate (pictured) are worried that Lord Bath plans to begin fracking as the area is close to the Mendips which has been mooted for possible test drilling. Council officials are advising them on how to respond

She continued: 'They are not seeking to create any new rights, but to protect existing ones,â€
