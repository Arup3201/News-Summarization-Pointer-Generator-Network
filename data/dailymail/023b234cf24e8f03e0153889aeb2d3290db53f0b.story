He looked dumbfounded when he was crowned winner of the X Factor.

And it seems the reality of winning television's biggest talent show prize still hasn't quite sunk in for James Arthur. 

The newly anointed X Factor winner looked decidedly bashful as he left the post-final party in Manchester in the early hours of Monday morning.

However, despite his 
recently acquired ladykiller status, James, 24, who has been linked to Xtra Factor host Caroline Flack, left the Manchester party alone.

The winner takes it all: James Arthur leaves his own winners party looking decidedly sober

James was sporting a small Cheshire cat grin as she left the party in a sombre grey coat and jeans.

Onlookers said chaotic scenes broke out as the celebrities flocked into the building, with one excited fan falling over and indecently exposing herself.

But James was a picture of calm considering he had won the show, a marked difference to earlier nights out when he had been seen trying to sneak a mystery brunette into his hotel.

Perhaps the winner has become less of a ladykiller and more of a one woman guy as the rumour mills goes into overdrive about a possible romance with Xtra Factor host Caroline.

James revealed that Caroline told him
they were not allowed to date after she came under fire over her 
romance with former X Factor contestant One Direction's Harry Styles.

He told the Mirror: 'Caroline's a 
laugh and we do flirt, I think she feels it too but I'm not sure if it's
going anywhere. She said she doesn't think we can date while the show 
is on. You never know what can happen afterwards.'

On Saturday's episode of the spin-off
show, James said that seeing Caroline was the highlight of the entire 
final as he sat beside her.

Answering Flack's question about his favourite event of the evening, the cheeky star said: 'My highlight was seeing you babe.'

However he was up bright and early 
for show Daybreak on Monday. He said he is eager to release an album 'as
quickly as possible' and has already written some tracks.

'That is why my reaction was so still. I couldn't believe it. I actually thought (Dermot O'Leary) said Jahmene.'

talent, he's my idol.'

James
and Jahmene were seen locked in an emotional embrace onstage, but kept 
their distance at the party, which was attended by former X Factor 
winners Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock.

The Little Mix ladies lent their 
support to James in their trademark midriff baring outfit with 
Leigh-Anne wearing some extra tight leggings and leather jacket.

The Middlesbrough-born star, who won with 54 percent of the public vote, has vowed not to let Simon Cowell dominate his music, telling the Daily Mirror: 'I will insist on having total control.

'The thing is, I thought here wouldn't be much creative control during the X Factor process and there has been a massive amount.

'They don't mess with me, I'm a bada** me.'

But although he admitted he stole food to survive aged just 15, parents Neil and Shirley were backstage at his very first audition.
