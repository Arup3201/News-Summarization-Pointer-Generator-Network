It was perhaps meant to be that Didier Drogba's first goal in his second spell at Chelsea came from the penalty spot in the Champions League - just as his first period at the club ended.

And the Chelsea legend went for the same corner of the net as his winning spot kick in Munich just over two years ago, this time marking the 12th consecutive season in which he has scored in the Champions League.

Only Real Madrid and Schalke's Raul has a better record, notching in 14 campaigns back-to-back, while Ryan Giggs managed 11.

Drogba started his run in the 2003/04 season with Marseille before scoring in all eight of his previous seasons in the competition with Chelsea. He then grabbed goals in the past two seasons for Turkish club Galatasaray during his time there.

And his 23rd minute penalty made it 12-in-a-row as well as giving Chelsea a 2-0 lead that Maribor never looked likely to overhaul.

It was his seventh appearance of the season in a bit-part role in Jose Mourinho's squad, but the Ivorian could end up starting at Old Trafford against Manchester United on Sunday with Diego Costa and Loic Remy both nursing injuries.

Remy came off for Drogba against Maribor with a suspected groin problem, while top scorer Costa is still wrestling with a hamstring injury suffered on international. duty.

PS...

The last time John Terry and  Drogba scored in the same match for Chelsea was back in March 14, 2012, in the 4-1 Champions League win over Napoli.

Chelsea went on to win the competition that year. What chances of Terry and Drogba replicating the feat again this season?
