The iconic Cafe de Paris in Rome - the inspiration behind Federico Fellini's classic La Dolce Vita - has been destroyed in a suspected arson attack.

During the heady days of the Dolce Vita in the 1960s, Cafe de Paris was one of the preferred watering holes of the rich and famous with patrons such as Sofia Loren and Frank Sinatra.

The blaze at the historic bar on Rome’s Via Veneto is thought to be connected to the eviction of its new management on the morning of the fire.

Flames broke out in the basement next to a changing room for employees at around 1am on Tuesday. No one was injured.

Aldo Berti, manager of the bar since 2009, said: ‘A can of petrol was found next to the start of the fire.

'Not long afterwards we were served with an eviction notice. Now all the staff will lose their jobs.’

Cafe de Paris, one of the places that gave the world the word paparazzi, fell into decline along with the rest of Rome's famed Via Veneto in 2009 when police discovered it was a mafia money-laundering front and confiscated it before it was entrusted to a legal guardian.

The
 bar on one of Rome’s most expensive streets had been bought in 2005 for
 250,000 euros in cash in the name of a penniless barber called Damiano 
Villari, although at the time it was worth an estimated six million 
euros.

The famed sidewalk cafe and restaurant had in fact been purchased by the 
Cosoleto clan of the 'Ndrangheta organized crime group from southern 
Calabria in 2005 and it had been used, along with other bars and 
restaurants in Rome and Milan, to launder drug money.

Four years ago marked a rebirth when, in association with one of Italy's leading anti-Mafia groups Libera, Cafe de Paris started serving wines, pasta and other foods produced on lands confiscated from the Mafia throughout southern Italy

It is a far cry from Fellini's 1960 classic, which starred the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni as a society reporter - his kiss with Anita Ekberg in the Trevi Fountain has become one of the most famous scenes in cinema history

Father 
Luigi Ciotti, the head of Libera said at the time: 'Everyone should know that the 
Cafe de Paris is now free of the mafia presence. An establishment that 
once enriched the clans of the 'Ndrangheta has returned to being a legal
 business.'

'This
 is a concrete sign of a daily fight (against organised crime) that is 
gradually bearing fruit. We need people to know that this establishment 
is now 'clean'. It's the start of a new chapter.'

The
 Ndrangheta are the country’s wealthiest and most feared criminal 
organisation and are responsible for the import of 80 per cent of 
Europe’s cocaine.

Much of their earnings are laundered through legitimate businesses.

Seven in ten of Rome’s historic centre restaurants pizzerias and cafes are thought to be in the hands of organised crime, according to the municipal.

Figures from LUISS University in Rome put the turnover for Mafia groups from their Rome operations at more than one billion euros a year.

Fellini's 1960 classic film, which starred the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg and Anouk Aimee, was considered scandalous at the time of its release but is quite tame by the standards of today.

In seven loosely connected episodes, Mastroianni, playing reporter Marcello, covers the escapades of residual nobility, nouveau riche, starlets and hangers-on of the cafe set on the Via Veneto as he struggles to find meaning in his own life.

Marcello chronicles events with a photographer whose last name is Paparazzo: the name Fellini gave him is now in dictionaries in nearly every language meaning aggressive street photographers.

In its emblematic scene, Sylvia, a towering phosphorescent blonde diva played by Ekberg, lures Marcello into a sensual midnight wade in the cold waters of Rome's Trevi Fountain.
