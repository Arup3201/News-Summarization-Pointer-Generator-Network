Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said this week she is 'very seriously considering' a presidential run.

A source familiar with the 60-year-old plans told DailyMail.com that Fiorina - the only GOP woman to give the race a strong look, so far - is still undecided and would make a decision between March or April.

Fiorina has never held public office and would rely heavily on her background in business in bid to become the nation's chief executive. 

'I think we need different experience, different perspective and a different voice,' she told Neil Cavuto in an interview that Thursday night on Fox Business Network.

IN THE RED: Fiorina's unsuccessful 2010 US Senate campaign is still a half-million dollars in debt

Fiorina unsuccessfully challenged California Sen. Barbara Boxer in 2010, losing to the incumbent lawmaker by 10 points. This June she launched her own political action committee, Unlocking Potential, which supports Republican women running for political office.

The probable 2016 candidate has made several trips to Iowa and New Hampshire in the last year and has reportedly been talking to donors and activists in the all-important presidential primary states about her interest in running.

Last week Fiorina brought a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, onto Unlocking Potential's payroll. The PAC said Flores would serve as Fiorina's deputy campaign manager if she does enter the 2016 contest.

A Virginia native, Fiorina moved to California in the 90s, joining HP in 1999. She went on to become CEO of the company before being forced to resign in 2005 after it merged with Compaq. She was the first woman to head a Fortune 50 business.

She served as a surrogate for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 before running for the U.S. Senate against Boxer in 2010.

As of late September, Fiorina's Senate campaign, Carly for California, was still $500,000 in debt, owing sums as high as $80,000 to former vendors and staff. But as of this month all of those bills has been paid off, a Fiorina insider told DailyMail.com.

After the 2010 Senate race Fiorina and her husband, Frank, a former AT&T exec, moved back to northern Virginia, allowing her to be closer to her daughter and grandchildren while making it easier for her to embark on increasingly frequent trips to Washington, D.C.

On Tuesday she will headline a March for Life event at the Washington headquarters of leading conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. 

Next month she'll be a featured speaker at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, being held this year just outside of the nation's capital city in National Harbor, Maryland. CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union, whose foundation Fiorina is on the board of. 

An an entrepreneurship event in Washington on Wednesday, Fiorina gave a preview of her possible campaign stump speech. 

Without talking directly about politics, the former businesswoman hammered on quintessential conservative themes, knocking 'big government' and advocating for less red tape. 

Fiorina is making the rounds and keeping her name in the news as she decides whether to pull the presidential trigger

'When was the last time that we actually did an inventory of all the regulations that are on the books? Answer: not in my lifetime, not in anybody’s lifetime,' she said, per a report from Time. 

'It’s like geologic sediment. We have eons, millennia of rules and regulations at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level, and it has become a primordial soup. And if you’re a big company you can handle it, but if you’re a startup or small company you really can’t. The point is, we have to start undoing some of this stuff.'

In the interview with Cavuto that aired on Thursday evening, Fiorina argued, 'It’s not the entrepreneurial spirit in this nation that is dying' it's just that 'we have a leviathan called the government that’s crushing that spirit.

'And if you ask those small business owners ... 70 percent of them consider government hostile to them,' she said, according to the Hill. 

Fiorina said the government has become 'so big, so complex, so unaccountable, so inefficient, so corrupt in so many cases that it is becoming harder and harder for people with guts, and brains, and ambitions and gifts to put them to work.'

Should she run for president, Fiorina said this week that her experience in business, that allows her to 'make complex decisions,' would be a major boon to the country.

'I think we are crushing the potential of this nation, and this should be the American century. But so much of what policies and politicians are doing are making it too hard for Americans to fulfill their potential,' she told Fox News' Greta Van Susteran.

Referencing the lack of a visible U.S. presence at a Sunday unity rally in Paris after the recent terrorist attack on satirical news publication Charlie Hebdo, Fioria said, 'The world is a sadder and more dangerous place without American leadership, and America is not leading today in the world.'

Fiorina said it's 'inconceivable' that President Barack Obama 'wasn't even aware' that the march was taking place 'and that he had a decision to make.'

'I just find his apparent ignorace of what's going on around him quite stunning, and obviously he is failing as a chief executive,' she said.
