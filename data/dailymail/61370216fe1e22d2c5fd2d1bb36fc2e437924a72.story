Enough is enough. England’s embarrassing early exit from the World Cup needs to be a wake-up call that something is fundamentally wrong in our national game and it needs fixing or we’ll be also-rans for ever.

To say that we are now a laughing stock is not right, but only because our major rivals didn’t start this World Cup genuinely fearing England. England crashing out is not a surprise to them, or to be honest with ourselves, to us.

In my opening column I feared England may not get out of Group D. I desperately wanted to be wrong but we could not cope when we came up against true quality: Italy and Pirlo, Uruguay and Suarez.

Out here in Rio I’m losing track of the number of fellow professionals from other places asking me: ‘What the hell is going on with your team’s defenders? It’s a joke, comical defending.’

Yes, it is. And there is no point in shying away from identifying several specific areas where England got it wrong or were simply not up to the job.

At the back, England were below par, incapable of handling clinical finishers. There are problems in midfield. There’s a lack of confidence all around the pitch. On-pitch leaders are lacking.

And Roy Hodgson fell between two stools in his approach to mixing youth and experience. He left behind the nous-heavy, tournament-hardened Michael Carrick and Ashley Cole, played his captain Steven Gerrard in a tough role, and gave youth its head only to an extent.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing but there was a case for saying up front that this was going to be an event to gain experience, for the youngsters, across the whole XI. They’d learn how to prepare, play, rest, gain that high intensity experience.

Head boy: Raheem Sterling has been one of England's best players at the World Cup

Impact player: Ross Barkley has come on for England twice as substitute during the World Cup

Learning curve: Luke Shaw is yet to feature for England at the World Cup but has gained vital experience

When I went to a World Cup as a kid in 1998, I soaked it up like a sponge but there’s nothing like getting stuck in, full immersion.

Yet the real shame in our national game and the issue that has to be tackled urgently is that we just do not have enough good players.

With respect to the 23 in the squad, including some seasoned veterans who have done it all at club level and some extremely talented youngsters, our talent pool is puddle deep. Much as we can all talk about the promise of Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, that just’s half a dozen people aged 24 or under. We shouldn’t be talking in single digits, we should expect many dozens.

Costa Rica have a population of five million. Croatia, Bosnia and Uruguay have even fewer. Is it not now blindingly obvious that something is very wrong when England, the home of football, the country that codified the game and took it to the world, a country with 53 million people, cannot field a decent team?

We lack facilities and coaches at all levels, and opportunities for top-level playing experience for the best young players. I was part of the FA Commission who considered these issues; one report has been published and another is on its way. Some suggestions for change are controversial but let’s be absolutely clear: there are very specific identifiable issues. I’ll give you just a tiny example. In the whole of England there are 639 3G all-weather pitches. Germany have more than 5,000.

An FA survey of clubs at all levels found 84 per cent of respondents saying facilities are poor. It hasn’t changed. This directly impacts on how many teams and at what age-groups kids can play.

We have too few coaches, and those we have are not as well qualified as they should be. Spain have 25,000 coaches with A, B and Pro Licences. Germany have 35,000. We have 6,000. Coaching is respected elsewhere, valued, literally. In Germany and the Netherlands a youth coach can earn £40,000 a year. It’s a profession. In England the equivalent pay is £16,000. That’s vocational, a hobby.

Anyone who cannot see the link between all these factors and an under-performing England team is kidding themselves.

Touch tight: Phil Jagielka closes down Luis Suarez during England's defeat to Uruguay on Thursday

Centre of attention: Gary Cahill rises above Luis Suarez to clear the ball for England

England have conceded goals via poor defending. It’s unacceptable and in tournament terms it’s been the killer. Why can’t we concentrate? As soon as England equalised against Uruguay on Thursday, I was whooping off-air every bit as much as Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer alongside me. Then I said I’d take the draw immediately because I feared what might happen next.

We don’t have top-class centre halves. There is no intention here to demean the capabilities of Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill, and I mean that sincerely. The worrying truth is, they are the best players available for England with enough game time under their belts.

Jagielka is an eight out 10 man every game he plays for Everton. Cahill is the most improved English defender in the Premier League in recent years, indeed a Champions League winner since he moved to Chelsea. But we’re talking about international football at the highest level. And are they good enough?

Left back: Ashley Cole was overlooked by Roy Hodgson for the World Cup despite all his experience

Missed a trick: Roy Hodgson should have included Michael Carrick (right) in his 23-man World Cup squad

What you need at a World Cup is to utilise the very best defensive unit as a whole that you DO have, with the most experience, and England left that at home in the shape of Cole at left back and Carrick in the key defensive midfielder role.

I won’t even go into the situation with John Terry, because he was not available. But suffice to say that in an ideal world you would take and use all your best players at a World Cup. And for various reasons, England haven’t done that.

Hogdson and Gerrard were both tasked with impossible jobs and that has led to us ending up with unsatisfactory compromises.

Let’s look ahead now, everyone is saying, let’s look to Euro 2016, it’s not all doom and gloom.I hope it’s not. But unless we get the big picture right, I fear we’ll be back here in a couple of years saying all this again.
