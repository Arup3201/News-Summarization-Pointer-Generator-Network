Louis van Gaal has admitted that he did not fully appreciate the amount of work needed to restore Manchester United to the top of English football.

The Dutchman, who took charge at Old Trafford after leading Holland at the World Cup this summer, is without a win in three competitive games after overseeing a dismal 4-0 defeat by League One MK Dons in the Capital One Cup this week.

And after splashing out a British transfer record fee of £59.7million on midfielder Angel di Maria, the 63-year-old revealed that the size of the job at hand has come as a shock.

Asked whether the scale of rebuilding required was a surprise, Van Gaal said: 'Yes. But that is looking at the past. That is a question I don't want to answer. Why? Because I want to show my respect to David Moyes and to Mr Ferguson. 

'I think we have to look at the future and that we are doing now with Manchester United. We are restoring and rebuilding a new team. That costs time, I'm sorry to say that.'

United face Burnley on Saturday looking for their first victory of the new Premier League season and Van Gaal is hoping to repay the club's fans with three points at Turf Moor.

He added: 'I'm sorry to say that to the fans because the fans are amazing in my opinion. We were at MK Dons and we lost 4-0 but they were still singing. They were supporting the players. I think it's fantastic that we have such fans. 

'I hope that we shall fulfil their expectations but I said already that it’s not done in one month, in spite of our wins against Real Madrid and Liverpool. We have to win, we have to give results and hopefully we will start at Burnley.'
