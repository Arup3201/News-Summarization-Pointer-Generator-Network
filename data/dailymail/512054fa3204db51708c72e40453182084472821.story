Wanted criminal Sam Greenwood taunted police by writing 'Catch me if you can' on Rochdale police's Facebook page - only to be caught hours later

A criminal who taunted police on Facebook after going on the run has been jailed.

Sam Greenwood, 19, was sentenced to 10 months in prison for a string of burglary and car crimes.

It comes after police put an appeal for information on the wanted teenager on Facebook, and Greenwood replied, saying: ‘Catch me if you can.’

But
the officers had the last laugh when they arrested Sam Greenwood just 
12 hours later...and added their own riposte: ‘Caught you. Do not pass 
Go, do not collect £200, go straight to jail.’

Greenwood, from Rochdale, was sentenced 
to four months in a Young Offenders’ Institute in January after his 
driving conviction.

He was freed on licence, but failed to 
attend mandatory appointments at Rochdale Probation Service and a man hunt for his arrest was launched.

Officers
from Greater Manchester Police put out an appeal on the official GMP 
Rochdale North Facebook page, alongside Greenwood’s photograph.

The
next day Greenwood wrote underneath: ‘Catch me if you can.’ Police 
urged him to hand himself in, posting: ‘You are a talented young man. 
Don’t waste your life away. So many people are willing to help you – but
you’ve got to start helping yourself.’

Greenwood failed to heed their advice, but was spotted by officers out on patrol and placed back behind bars on June 26.

They
then returned to Facebook to respond a second time: ‘Caught you. Do not
pass Go, do not collect £200, go straight to jail.’

On Wednesday, he was sentenced at Bury magistrates court after previously pleading guilty to failing to comply with the conditions of his licence, two counts of vehicle interference, taking a vehicle without consent, attempted burglary and car theft.

Greenwood was matched to the crimes after leaving a trail of blood and fingerprints.

While in custody he also admitted to 32 other offences, including theft from a motor vehicle and vehicle interference, which were taken into consideration.

Defending, Asim Ali said: 'What's 
happened in the immediate past is that when he's gone to probation, 
police have gone and arrested him and taken him into custody for a 
number of days.

'There is a pattern of this and because of that he's stopped going.'

Caught you: The GMP Rochdale North page showed 59 people 'liked' Greenwood's 'Catch me if u can' comment

The court heard Greenwood has 20 previous convictions for 45 offences - the majority relating to motor vehicles.

In 2011, Greenwood was jailed for a series of crimes including taking vehicles without the consent of the owner, driving whilst disqualified, burglary and theft.

He also admitted theft of a JCB worth £25,000 and his part in the attack of a taxi driver.

Chairman of the bench, Maxine Hamer, said: 'We find these offences so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified. They are aggravated by your record of dishonesty.'

Speaking after his arrest, Inspector Umer Khan of Rochdale North said: ‘Unfortunately this man was always going to be a hostage to fortune once he decided to goad us on Facebook. I tried my best to coax him into handing himself in, but he seemed determined to remain at large. 

‘Thankfully, we managed to track him down in no time at all and he is now back where he belongs for the time being – behind bars.’

He is not the first criminal to 
regret his Facebook use. In March, thief Anthony Swinburn, 28, was 
caught days after he mocked up his own wanted poster and posted it on 
the social networking site. He was subsequently jailed for 16 months.

Last
year Michael Ruse, 21, was forced to change his plea to guilty after he
posted a comment telling a friend he was ‘going to get away with it’ 
during his trial for assault. Judge Ian Pearson, sitting at Portsmouth 
Crown Court, told him: ‘You were stupid enough to put on Facebook what 
amounted to a full confession. Your stupidity really is not much 
mitigation.’

Paramedic 
Mark Small boasted on the site that he groped a patient’s breasts whilst
resuscitating her, writing: ‘Saved someone’s life and managed to cop a 
feel of some cracking jubblies.’ A complaint was made and he was found 
guilty of misconduct by the Health Professions Council.
