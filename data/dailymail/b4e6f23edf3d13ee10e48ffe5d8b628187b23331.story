The 3,500 servicemen now drafted in to bolster security during London 2012 will be forced to camp in disused buildings.

Derelict schools, warehouses, factories and hospitals near the Olympic Park could be commandeered to give them somewhere to sleep.

Many personnel – some only just back from gruelling tours on the Afghan front line – have been ordered to cancel home leave or holidays with their friends and families. About 1,000 will be flown in from Germany.

They will join 13,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines already deployed to protect the Olympics against a terrorist atrocity.

The 17,000 force is greater than that fighting the Taliban.

And the decision to fill the shortfall of civilian guards left by G4S has left a massive headache for defence chiefs who have to find temporary accommodation for them all.

Some will camp in a tented ‘city’ within London. It is understood camps will be erected inside Wellington Barracks near St James’s Park and at the Royal Artillery base at Woolwich.

But a Whitehall source said the ‘favoured option’ was to find disused buildings large enough to house vast numbers of troops.

‘We are looking at industrial buildings, disused office blocks, disused schools. That is the most likely option. The conditions will be pretty austere but troops are more than used to making the best out of spartan conditions.’

Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to plead with The Ministry of Defence for help with security during the Olympic Games

To add insult to injury, Home Secretary Theresa May rewarded troops who have had leave cancelled with tickets to the dress rehearsal of the opening and closing ceremonies.

She was criticised for failing to allow servicemen and women who were bailing her out to watch the real thing while MPs get free tickets for the blue riband 100 metres final.

Around 5,000 extra tickets were made available for the practices, making a total of 7,000.

One serving military officer said: ‘A lot of soldiers have had to cancel well-earned holidays with their loved ones to help dig Theresa May and the Olympics organisers out of this fiasco. It’s a bit condescending to say to them, “Here are some tickets to thank you – but, sorry, they’re not for the proper opening and closing ceremonies.”

It’s insulting. I wonder how many MPs will be watching the dress rehearsals and how many will be watching the real thing.’

The Government has already announced 10,000 tickets are available for the Armed Forces under the Tickets For Troops scheme.

Among the soldiers called up to rescue Olympic security are those serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which was axed as a fighting force just days ago in defence cuts.

The men of the 131-year-old unit are already reeling from the demoralising news that it will be reduced next year to ceremonial duties.

Personnel who had already been allocated to the Games were to do 12-hour shifts on six-day cycles for three months, with one day a week off.

Many of the jobs involve checking bags, tickets and vehicles.

Defence Secretary Philip  Hammond said: ‘Ministers across government recognise the burden that this additional short-notice deployment will impose upon  servicemen and women and their families, especially over the summer holiday season.

‘We will ensure that all those  taking part receive their full leave entitlement, that no one is out of pocket due to cancelled personal arrangements and that all deployed personnel are appropriately supported.’
