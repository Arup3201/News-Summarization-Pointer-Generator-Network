The good people from Microsoft Corp are at it again.

The tech giant's co-founder, Paul Allen, says his charitable foundation is donating $9 million to support the fight against the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, just a month after donating $2.8 million to the American Red Cross for its work on the outbreak.

The gift to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comes at a time when international groups, including Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, have said resources to contain the epidemic and treat those affected are falling tragically short.

Allen's donation joins that of the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation, which has pledged $50 million to United Nations agencies and 
other international groups to purchase supplies, such as protective gear
 for healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, and to expand the 
emergency response.

Fears:
 The Ebola virus has killed more than 2,000 people in Guinea, Liberia, 
Sierra Leone and Nigeria this year in the largest outbreak of the 
disease ever.  Above, a health worker sprays a man believed to be dying

'The tragedy of Ebola is that we know how
 to tackle the disease, but the governments in West Africa are in dire 
need of more resources and solutions,' Allen said in a statement. 'The developed world needs to step up now 
with resources and solutions.'

Allen said the donation from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation will help CDC establish emergency operations centers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed about 2,300 people and shows no sign of slowing six months after it began.

U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $88 million in new Ebola funding, including $25 million for CDC, but this week congressional leaders said they would provide no more than $40 million.

Allen said his foundation's gift would help CDC establish and equip emergency operations centers in the three most-affected countries, focusing on public health, not patient care.

The centers will use 'data management and communication systems for disease and patient contact tracing, to detect and stop the disease from spreading,' Allen said.

They will also expand lab testing to identify new outbreaks, and disseminate information about the epidemic to the public.

'A winnable battle should never be lost,' Allen said.

CDC has just more than 100 public health experts in the Ebola zone, and plans to send more.

'Ebola is raging through parts of West Africa like an out-of-control forest fire but it can be controlled if the world comes together,' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement.

The CDC Foundation, which was established by Congress in 1994 to raise funding to augment what CDC gets from Congress, recently committed $1 million to the Ebola response, including money for computers, personal protective equipment and thermal scanning thermometers for airport screeners, and training for healthcare workers.

Since resigning from Microsoft in 1983, Allen has become a prominent philanthropist, supporting scientific research through the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.

The donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will also support emergency response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa — and represents the charity's largest donation to a humanitarian effort.

'It became clear to us over the last seven to 10 days that the pace and scope of the epidemic was increasing significantly,' said Chris Elias, president of global development for the world's largest charitable foundation.

Currently
 the virus can only be transmitted through contact with a victim's 
bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, diarrhea and other secretions 

The Seattle-based foundation said the money will go to the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CDC and international organizations involved in fighting transmission of the virus.

The money will be used to purchase supplies and to develop vaccines, therapies and better diagnostic tools. 

'By fighting Ebola now, we can make sure it doesn't become an endemic in [West] Africa,' Gates tweeted on Wednesday.

The foundation wants to help stop the outbreak as well as accelerate development of treatments and improve prevention.

Elias said foundation officials have been talking to its partners around the world to assess the best use of its dollars and could not say yet how much would be spent on the emergency response and how much on research and development.

'One of our key advantages is flexibility,' he said.

Global health and development dominate the work of the foundation, which has given away $30 billion since 1997.

The foundation formed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife reported an endowment worth $40billion as of March 2014.

The foundation was particularly influenced by the request on Friday by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for $600million to fight the Ebola outbreak.

Ban said 
efforts in the next few weeks would be essential to stopping the virus 
that has killed more than 2,000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone 
and Nigeria. 

The
 $50million includes $10million the foundation previously committed for 
emergency operations, treatment and research. Of that money, $5million 
went to the World Health Organization for emergency operations and 
research and development. 

Another
 $5million went to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF to support efforts in 
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to purchase medical supplies, 
coordinate response efforts and spread information.

Some
 of the $50million will support strengthening existing health care 
systems in the countries affected by the outbreak, the foundation said.
