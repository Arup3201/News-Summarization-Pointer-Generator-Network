Samuel Eto’o watched his new Sampdoria team-mates play out a 1-1 draw with Palermo at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris after completing a medical.

The 33-year-old Cameroonian has officially swapped Everton for Genoa as Samp bid to harness his firepower and qualify for the Champions League, and he was in the Marassi stands on Sunday.

The former Barcelona forward joined the Toffees on a free transfer in August 2014, and has scored four goals in all competitions so far this season.

Eder’s early opener temporarily boosted them into third place but Franco Vazquez hit back after the break and eighth-placed Palermo were unlucky not to turn their second-half dominance into a victory.

But with 34 points from 20 games, Sinisa Mihaljovic’s Samp climb above Napoli and into fourth place.
