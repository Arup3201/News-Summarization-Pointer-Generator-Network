Barack Obama pledged to be the champion of America’s embattled  middle class in a desperate last-minute pitch for votes before the country goes to the polls today in one of the closest ever presidential elections.

His chances of a second term were boosted last night after a final Washington Post-ABC News poll gave him a three point lead, at 50 per cent of the national vote, ahead of his Republican challenger Mitt Romney on 47 per cent.

Earlier yesterday, however, polls by Gallup and Rasmussen both put Mr Romney on 49 per cent and Mr Obama on 48 per cent. The President used a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, to deliver some of the soaring rhetoric which propelled him to power in 2008, but which now rings hollow for many voters.

He promised that he would use a second presidential term to fight for a more equitable America against opponents who sought only to help the rich elites.

‘I’m not ready to give up the fight for the middle classes,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you have to fight, stand on principle.’ Mr Obama was joined on stage by rock star Bruce Springsteen, one of nearly 200 celebrities who answered an 11th-hour Democrat call to arms.

With many Obama supporters feeling distinctly underwhelmed by his candidacy this time, the Democrats have relied on stars and public figures to help drum up excitement and get people out to vote.

They include pop stars such as Lady Gaga and Jay-Z, and actors Anne Hathaway, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson.

While many confined their aid to talking to radio shows some, such as actor Danny DeVito in Wisconsin, have been out canvassing, making phone calls and visiting local colleges.

With the 17-month, £1.9billion election campaign – the most expensive ever – boiling down to the outcome in a handful of swing states and  one, Ohio, in particular, both candidates pulled out all the stops in the final hours.

Between the candidates and their two aspiring vice-presidents, they criss-crossed the country, taking part in 14 events across eight states. The President also visited Ohio and Iowa. Mitt Romney was in Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire as well as Ohio.  

Mr Romney rubbished Mr Obama’s economic record and his claim to have helped the middle class, which he said was ‘being squeezed’ with high unemployment as well as rising prices for everything from insurance to petrol.

‘Do you want four more years like the last four years?’ he asked a crowd in Lynchburg, Virginia.

Ramming home his determination to create jobs and slash government spending, he said: ‘My vision is to limit government rather than limit the dreams of our fellow Americans.’

The election hangs on a knife edge. All predictions show there is barely any difference in support and this could be the closest contest since George W Bush took on Al Gore in 2000. However, the Obama camp has been buoyed by electoral number-crunching which gives him the edge in winning most of the crucial ‘battleground’ states.

It is also becoming clear that Mr Obama may have benefited in the polls from Superstorm Sandy which not only showed him handling the devastation but also kept Mr Romney out of the public eye for three crucial days.

What remains certain is that neither contender is going to receive a ringing endorsement from the electorate, as Mr Obama did four years ago. Both men will know that as many Americans will have voted against them as voted for them.

The pair’s choice of stops on their final day of campaigning emphasised where they believe they might clinch the election, with Mr Obama concentrating on the Midwest and Mr Romney on the south.

Neither passed up on a chance to re-visit Ohio – for Mr Romney, his 44th visit during the campaign.

The industrial Midwestern state has picked the winner of the past 12 elections and no Republican has clinched the White House without winning Ohio.

Visiting Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa yesterday Mr Obama concentrated on shoring up what he has called the ‘firewall’ of battleground Midwestern states which Democrats believe will dash Republican hopes.

After a final event in Des Moines, Iowa, where he was introduced by First Lady Michelle Obama, the couple flew to Chicago where they will spend election day.
