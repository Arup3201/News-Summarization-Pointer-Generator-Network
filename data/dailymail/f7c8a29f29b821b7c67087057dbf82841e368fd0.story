A grieving widower has been banned from being a patient at a medical practice after they paid him £30,000 compensation for mistaking his wife's heart condition for bronchitis.

Martin Howell, 60, was shocked when the GP surgery wrote to him saying his legal action against them had caused their relationship to ‘break down’.

The angry father-of-two said: ‘I’m being penalised for complaining about a doctor who I blame for my wife’s death.

‘It is absolutely disgusting. These doctors are employed with taxpayers’ money and they can just pick and choose who they want.’

Mr Howell received an out-of-court settlement two years after his wife Irene, 60, died from a heart condition.

Mrs Howell was first diagnosed with a heart problem at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS) in 2008.

Two years later she started suffering breathing problems and water blisters on her legs.

She was examined by Dr HL Verma at Meir Health Centre in Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire who misdiagnosed her with bronchitis and prescribed antibiotics.

Her condition did not improve and the couple eventually saw a different 
doctor at the same practice who sent Irene to the University Hospital 
North Staffordshire where she died hours later.

Mr Howell said: ‘I thought they would just give her some drugs and after a couple of days she would be back home.

‘By 2am, I had to make the awful decision to turn off her life-support machine.

Dr Verma no longer works at the 
surgery and after moving back to the area, Mr Howell tried to register 
as a patient but was told he was not welcome.

Angry: Mr Howell said he was 'being penalised for complaining about a doctor who I blame for my wife's death.'

A
letter from the surgery stated: ‘Your relationship with the practice, 
as a result of the action taken against us, has broken down.’

Mr Howell appealed to Stoke-on-Trent’s NHS but his pleas were rejected over the weekend.

He said: ‘It was never about the money. I just wanted it to be recognised that something had gone terribly wrong.’

The couple were married for 39 years after living opposite each other in their teens.

Part of the pay-out has been split between sons Steven, 34, and Mark, 31, who live in Blythe Bridge in Staffordshire.

The NHS confirmed Dr Verma is no longer registered as a GP.

A spokesman for the Staffordshire Cluster of PCTs said: ‘Dr Verma retired and removed his name from the General Medical Council Register so he can no longer practice.’

The practice declined to comment on the ban.
