Jefferson Montero is a name Calum Chambers won't forget in a hurry and he might just stick around in a few other memories after the way he led Swansea to a win over Arsenal on Sunday.

To followers of South American football, the only surprise is that it's taken this long for Montero to draw wider attention. For years the Ecuadorian has been hyped as a future star, but so far has only fleetingly lived up to the predictions.

Here, Sportsmail offers a guide to the flying winger…

Not bad against Arsenal, was he?

He was devastating – the most effective player on the pitch. He was helped by Calum Chambers' fatigue, but capitalised to give the 19-year-old right back an awful time. 

Long before he set up Bafetimbi Gomis's winner, it was obvious that Swansea's plan was to get him on the ball and running at Chambers. It was a brutal mismatch.

Tell us about him…

He's Ecuadorian and turned 25 last month having joined Swansea in the summer from Mexican club Monarcas Morelia for roughly £4million. Interestingly, he was actually close to joining Cardiff a year ago.

So this is his big break?

Not really. He's been about a bit, including three years in Spain, so this isn't his first taste of life in a big league. 

He started at Emelec in the Ecuadorian top flight in 2007, before joining Independiente, whom he left for a brief loan spell at Dorados in Mexico. He joined Villarreal in 2009 but struggled in Spain. 

He was often understudy to Santi Cazorla and was sent out on loan to Levante and Real Betis. He was a key part of the Pepe Mel-led Betis squad, but returned to Mexico in 2012 to join Morelia, where he won the Copa MC: Apertura 2013.

So he's been around. And he was at the World Cup as well, right?

Yes. He played all three of Ecuador's games in Brazil as they finished third in Group E. He made his Ecuador debut in 2007, aged 18, and was part of the side that won the Pan American Games that year – Ecuador's first international trophy. He has played 48 games for the national side, scoring eight.

What's his style?

As you saw on Sunday, he is rapid and an old-school, touchline-hugging left winger, yet a natural right footer. 

He can play on either flank but tends to be used on the left, even if that does mean he occasionally slows moves down by cutting inside. His pace is certainly his main weapon. 

At Swansea there are numerous speedsters – Wayne Routledge, Nathan Dyer and Curtis Obeng (on loan at Newport County) are all very quick. But Montero is believed by many at the club to be quickest of all. 

He loves to run at players but despite his excellence against Chambers his final ball has not always impressed since he arrived in Wales.

How has he settled in?

At 5ft 7ins, he fits in perfectly with Routledge in the sense that he is small and quick. But he has not been a first-choice starter by any means, with Routledge and Dyer get far more game time. 

He didn't start a Premier League game until the win over Leicester on October 25. In fact, the win over Arsenal was only his third league start, but crucially his third in succession. 

He seems to have broken through, even if Garry Monk did reveal on Sunday that Routledge and Dyer have injuries. 

His other eight league appearances have come from the bench, typically after 65 minutes, but started all three of their Capital One Cup games.

Any other standout performances?

Yes. No-one who was there will forget the mauling he gave Everton's Tony Hibbert in Swansea's cup win in September. And within moments of coming off the bench against Manchester United in the first game of the season he made the winning goal.

Montero will now be looking to score his first goal in Swansea colours since his summer transfer

There is no doubting that there are currently limitations to Montero's game – he is also yet to score for Swansea - but if he goes against a vulnerable full-back who can't match his pace, it's brutal.

What next?

He will be hoping to retain his form and place after the international break. Routledge will be back in training this week and Dyer won't train for seven or so days, but should be back after the international break. 

It will be interesting to see if Monk sticks with him when he has all his aces available and rested.
