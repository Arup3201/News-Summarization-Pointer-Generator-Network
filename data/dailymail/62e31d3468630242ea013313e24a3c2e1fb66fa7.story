A millionaire car dealer is about to begin his third trial on charges that he murdered his wife - but his children are insisting that he is innocent.

Calvin Harris, 53, is accused of bludgeoning his wife Michele, 35, to death in their home in Spencer, New York on the night of September 11, 2001 as they went through a bitter divorce.

But Harris, whose third trial will start this week after his two previous convictions were overturned, continues to maintain his innocence - and his four children, aged between 15 and 20, agree.

'I believe in him,' his son Tanner, 15, told People magazine.

His daughter, Cayla, 19, added: 'He might not have gotten along with my mom toward the end, but I know he loved my mom very much, and he tells me all the time she was a beautiful person, a great mother, and he would never do anything to hurt the mother of his children.'

Cayla, whose father has been in and out of prison throughout her life, says if her father is convicted again she will stay at home during her first few years of college to care for her younger siblings.

Harris heads back to court this week for jury selection.

This trial has been moved 140 miles away from his home to Schoharie County, after attorneys feared he would not get a fair trial in his own county.

'I'm just fighting to survive for these kids,' Harris told People. 'Nobody on the face of this earth deserves to be treated as I have.'

At the time of his wife's disappearance, he and Michele were living separately under the same roof as they brought up their children and hashed out the details of their separation.

After Mrs Harris filed for divorce in January 2001, her husband had an estimated worth of $5.4 million - and she rejected an initial statement offering her primary child custody and $740,000.

At the time she went missing, a trial had been scheduled to reach a deal. Prosecutors said Harris' motive for killing his wife was to keep his hands on his fortune.

Her hairdresser testified that she had heard Harris tell his wife in a phone call: 'Drop the divorce proceedings. Do you hear me? I will [expletive] kill you. I can make you disappear.'

On the night she went missing, she went out for drinks with friends before stopping at her boyfriend's apartment. Her minivan was found at the end of her home's drive the following morning.

Calvin Harris called the babysitter around 7am on September 12, 2001 to say that his wife had not returned from a night out so he needed help getting the children ready.

Her body was never found and investigators also failed to turn up a murder weapon, but they did find tiny splatters of her blood in the home, although their date was not determined.

By his side: Harris, pictured with Jenna, left, and Cayla, right, is currently out on bail after his conviction was overturned for the second time in 2012. He had previously been convicted of murder in 2007 and 2009

Investigators also noted that there were no signs of struggle in the home and that Harris did not have any marks on his body indicating his wife had fought him. 

Four years after she went missing, Harris was charged with murder and - after his indictment was initially thrown out - he was re-charged and convicted of her killing in June 2007.

But just a day later, a witness came forward to say he had seen Michele arguing with a man near to the couple's driveway and the case was re-opened.

After spending five months in prison, Harris was freed and a new trial was ordered. But he was found guilty in the second trial in October 2009 and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

During the first two trials, District Attorney Gerald Keene argued that Harris was the only logical suspect in the case, the Press & Sun Bulletin reported.

He argued that Michele was struck with an object at least twice in the home's kitchen and that, sometime between 11pm and 7am, he managed to dispose of her body and the weapon.

But in 2011, a judge in an appeals court said evidence in the case was insufficient to convict him, and it was sent to New York's Court of Appeals.

Scene: Prosecutors say Harris hit his wife twice across the head with an object on the night of September 11, 2001 at the home they still shared, pictured, before disposing of her body before 7am the next day

The court also found problems with the second trial - such as one of the jurors having pre-conceived ideas about the case - and threw out his conviction for a second time.

He was freed again in October 2012 on the $500,000 bail he had posted back in 2007 and is now awaiting his third trial, which is due to begin this week. 

Harris and his attorney argue that since the start of the investigation, he has been the only person authorities focused on.

'They have fixated on Cal from the beginning of this, and they are just not going to admit they got it wrong,' said his attorney Bruce Barket.

The attorney suggested that they know of another person who could be responsible for the murder, but he did not name them.

Michele's family told People that they stand by his convictions.
