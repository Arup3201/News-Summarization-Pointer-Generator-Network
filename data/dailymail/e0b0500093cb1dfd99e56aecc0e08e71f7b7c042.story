It was probably just horse play, but a contestant suggested an answer on Wheel of Fortune that prompted host Pat Sajak to walk off the set. 

A contestant in a two-man team taking part in Best Friends Week blurted out ‘riding a brown horse’ - with just an 'n' showing on the board.

Of course, the answer couldn't possibly be right because that phrase needs two 'n's.  

Guessing game: A contestant suggested 'riding a brown horse' after the letter 'n' came up on the board

Nagging feeling: The next contestant suggests 'riding a white horse' after the letter 'g' appears

The horse play is such that Pat Sajak decides he's had enough

Sajak mockingly strolls off the set, with the audience in fits of laughter

The audience burst out laughing and Sajak said ‘that’s amazing, and it’s wrong’.

Next a ‘g’ appears on the board next to the ‘n’. Unable to resist, the next contestants suggest ‘riding a white horse’.

The audience are in fits at this point – and Sajak, dumbfounded, mockingly strides off the set.

He returns a moment later and asks in desperation: ‘Who said anything about a horse?’

It’s by no means the first time that contestants have left Sajak perplexed.

Exasperated: 'Who said anything about a horse?' Sajak asks when he returns

Earlier this year a contestant suffered the ignominy of making what some described as the ‘dumbest guess ever’ on the game show.

He was faced with the following letters - S-RF C—Y –ERE WE COME’ - and asked to guess the phrase.

It was possible of course that the pressure of television got the better of him – or he’s just not a fan of golden oldies - but whatever the reason, the contestant, called Stephen, blurted out the nonsensical 'Surf Clay Where We Go'.

The correct answer is Surf City Here We Come, the title of rock and roll duo Jan & Dean’s 1963 classic.

Sajak bluntly replied ‘no’ after hearing his answer, with Stephen left looking slightly bewildered.
