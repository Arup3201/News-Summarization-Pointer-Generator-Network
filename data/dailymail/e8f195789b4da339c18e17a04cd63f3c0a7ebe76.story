A father helped his son and two friends kidnap a 13-year-old boy and bundle him into his car boot during 'a stupid prank that went very wrong'.

The trio of 14-year-olds wore balaclavas and even put on a fake accent to scare the victim during the bizarre incident in Torquay, Devon, last year.

A court heard how the young victim had been walking along a street when a black car suddenly pulled up and three older boys got out wearing balaclavas which they had picked up from an earlier go karting party.

Terrifying: The 13-year-old victim told a youth court he 'thought he was going to die' during the prank by three older boys wearing balaclavas (file picture) and one of their fathers

With one speaking in a Liverpudlian accent, they forced him into the boot before the father drove off.

A short time later the teenagers uncovered their faces and let the victim out.

He told South Devon Youth Court: 'I really did not know what was happening. I thought I was going to die.'

He added that he thought it was like something ‘from a movie’.

When he realised who the boys were he told his own father and the family contacted police.

Two of the boys were charged with kidnapping and faced prison before the Crown Prosecution Service eventually agreed to reduce it to common assault.

But the remaining offender and his father, who were both American and believed to be the ringleaders of the stunt, moved out of Torquay and returned to the US before charges could be brought.

None of the boys or the adult can be identified for legal reasons.

Legal representatives for the defendants said the group had been driving along the road when they thought it would be ‘a good idea to play a prank’ on the 13-year-old - but that no malice had been intended.

Solicitor Alasdair James, representing one of the boys, said it was 'a prank which had gone very wrong'.

He said the American boy's father had an ‘over indulgent relationship with his son and friends’.

Lawyer Paul Dentith, for the other defendant, said it was a ‘stupid plan hatched quickly'.

He said: 'It beggars belief that an adult in the car drove it off, he should not have stopped the car in the first place. It was a completely inappropriate prank which went so wrong.'

The boys, both from Torquay, Devon, both admitted assault.

Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said the victim’s mother, who ‘occupied a responsible position in society’, had 
built bridges with the defendants’ families and agreed that the charges 
could be reduced to common assault.

Sitting with their parents, one told the magistrates: 'It was a stupid idea.'

The other said: 'It was a stupid idea - a good joke at the time.'

The pair were warned they could have been jailed if the original kidnapping charges had been pursued.

Both boys were given a six month referral order and told to pay £50 each to the victim and £45 costs each.
