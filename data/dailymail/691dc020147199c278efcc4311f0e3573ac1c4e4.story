Argentine protestors demanding the return of the Falkland Islands are planning to disrupt Prince Harry's visit to Brazil later this week, the leader of the Argentine community in the country warned today.

Oswaldo Sicardi, the president of Clube Argentino in Rio de Janeiro said the prince's three day visit to the country was 'in extremely bad taste' just weeks before the 30th anniversary of the start of the Falklands War.

He called on Argentinians living in the city to 'show their anger' over the islands they call Las Malvinas by picketing the high profile visit.

Trouble before he arrives: Prince Harry, will arrive in Rio on Friday on a two-day diplomatic offensive - he is currently in the Central American state of Belize, as part of a Diamond Jubilee Tour of the Caribbean and Brazil

Prince Harry, 27, will arrive in Rio on Friday on a two-day diplomatic offensive designed to improve Britain's links with Latin American countries.

He is currently in the Central American state of Belize, as part of a Diamond Jubilee Tour of the Caribbean and Brazil.

His first public appearance will be at an event on Rio's world-famous Sugarloaf Mountain, billed as an opportunity to showcase all that is great about Britain.

Mr Sicardi said: 'I consider the arrival of Prince Harry, straight after the military exercises in the Malvinas an extremely unfortunate decision and one taken in extremely bad taste.

'Harry can come to Brazil any time he likes if the motive is to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee, raise the profile of his charity or to further business links.

'But he is clearly coming with an ulterior motive, to try to change Brazil's position in relation to the Malvinas.

'I consider it yet another act of provocation by Britain, along with deploying Prince William, sending nuclear submarines and its most powerful warship. Argentinians would be right to show their anger and bring this to the world's attention.

War of words: In January Argentines branded Prince William a 'conqueror' after his six-week deployment to the Falkland Islands, despite serving with an RAF Search and Rescue squadron rather than an armed unit

Mr Sircardi, who represents over 60 Argentine families living in Rio, refused to say if a protest was planned.

But he said: 'Let's just say that there may be groups of people who might cause some confusion in different places along Harry's way.'

He added: 'I would also call on Brazilian ministers to make their own protests if Harry brings up the subject of the Malvinas. It would be a huge error to try try to use the visit to change the position Brazil has clearly defined in a democratic way.

Tension: President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
 and David Cameron have engaged in a diplomatic war of words over the sovereignty of the islandsÂ 

'If he does try to approach the subject I would hope it would cause a big diplomatic storm across Latin America.'

Tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen.

Tension: In recent weeks hundreds of protestors marched on the British embassy in Buenos Aires and attacked a branch of British bank HSBC, burning Union Jacks and spraying walls with anti-British slogans as tensions over the islands continue to rise

In December, the Mercosur grouping of countries, which includes Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, announced that it would ban ships sailing under the Falkland Islands flag from docking at their ports.

In January Argentines branded Prince 
William a 'conqueror' after his six-week deployment to the Falkland 
Islands, despite serving with an RAF Search and Rescue squadron rather 
than an armed unit.

After the deployment of HMS Dauntless, one of the Royal Navy's most advanced warships, to the area, Argentina's foreign ministry accused Britain over 'militarising' the South Atlantic.
