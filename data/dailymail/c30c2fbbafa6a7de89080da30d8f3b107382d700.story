Derby are top of the league, playing some superb football; everything is going swimmingly for Steve McClaren. 

But unfortunately, the former England manager is still having to endure his fair share of embarrassing moments.

Rams midfielder Jeff Hendrick filmed McClaren before the win away at Blackpool battling against some fierce winds in the north-west and struggling to hold on to his suit bag in the process. 

Steve McClaren Strugles to carry his suit bag into the hotel as he battles the fierce winds

The 53-year-old sees the funny side as he is blown across the hotel forecourt in Blackpool 

Rams midfielder Jeff Hendrick posted the video of McClaren's struggles on his Instragram account 

McClaren's side battled against the elements to beat Blackpool  1-0 thanks to a late Chris Martin penalty to go top of the Championship table. 

Hendrick, instead of helping his boss, put a clip on his Instagram laughing away as the 53-year-old attempted to make his way to a hotel.

It is not the first embarrassing episode in McClaren's career in football. He was dubbed the 'Wally with the Brolly' when he sheltered from the rain at Wembley in England's miserable 3-2 defeat to Croatia that cost them qualification for Euro 2008 and his job.
