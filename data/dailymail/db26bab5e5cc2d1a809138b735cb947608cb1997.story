Families desperate to buy a home before house prices climb even higher are increasingly being asked to submit ‘sealed bids’, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday.

For the first time in its history, it yesterday published guidance about how sealed bids work and how to boost your chances of beating other buyers.

The advice provides further evidence of the country’s booming housing market with house prices rising in almost every region, particularly London and the South East.

Families desperate to buy a home before house prices climb even higher are increasingly being asked to submit 'sealed bids', the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday

A spokesman for the NAEA said yesterday: ‘Sealed bids are a countrywide phenomenon.’

It comes as the Council of Mortgage Lenders said yesterday the number of homes sold this year will be more than one million for the first time since the financial crisis began in 2007.

There has been ‘a particularly severe contraction’ in the number of homes bought and sold in Britain, it said, nearly halving from 1.6million in 2007 to just 886,000 in 2010.

But the market has dramatically recovered, with more people keen to buy than at any time since the recession began.

A separate report reveals how a local high-street with independent shops, rather than one dominated by supermarkets and other chains, added around £40,000 to the value of your home over the last decade.

The report, published by American Express, looked at homes which have many independent shops within a ten to 15 minute drive by car, compared to ones which do not.

Since 2003, it said homes have jumped by 55 per cent in value if they are close to independent shops, such as a local butcher, but only 46 per cent if they are not close to independents.

A thriving local high-street was defined as one which has 20 per cent more independent shops than other high-streets, but may also have shopping giants on the high-street.

For the first time in its history, it yesterday published guidance about how sealed bids work and how to boost your chances of beating other buyers

An independent is either a single shop, or one with no more than three outlets.

Kirstie Allsopp, the TV property expert, said: ‘Building extensions, new kitchens and bathrooms are not the only ways to add value to your house.

‘By shopping locally and supporting local traders, you are investing in your home as well as your high-street.’

A sealed bid is when a buyer has so many people who want to buy their home - or wants to generate this level of interest - that they ask for secret bids to be submitted.

The highest bid does not necessarily get the property, as the buyer might also evaluate who is in the best position to buy the property.

That is, a cash bidder might beat a buyer who needs a mortgage, or needs to sell a property before being able to buy a new home.

Jan Hÿtch, president of the NAEA, who works as an estate agent in Norwich, said the practice is particularly common in London but happening around the country.

She said: ‘Sealed bids are often used when interest in a property is high, and it is likely that more than one party could and would wish to purchase.’
