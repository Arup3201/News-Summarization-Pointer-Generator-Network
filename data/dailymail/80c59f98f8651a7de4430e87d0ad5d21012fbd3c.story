Lady Nora Colthurst accepted undisclosed libel damages and a public apology for the 'distressing' allegations, made by the daughter of her husband's lover

The former wife of the owner of Blarney Castle, home to the Blarney Stone, has been awarded damages after being branded a 'psycho' on an internet blog.

Lady Nora Colthurst accepted undisclosed libel damages and a public apology for the 'distressing' allegations, made by the daughter of her husband's lover.

Lady Colthurst, 57, had been married for 22 years to Sir Charles Colthurst.

The colourful owner of the 15th century Castle, near Cork, in Ireland, moved his mistress, Caroline Myers, a divorcee from Lincolnshire, into the family home as he waited for his separation from his wife to be finalised.

In a hearing at the High Court in London, Kate Wilson, for Lady Colthurst, told Mr Justice Tugendhat the marriage ended after Sir Charles began a relationship with the mother of Rachel Myers. 

Miss Myers made the allegations on her internet blog in 2005, when she was a teenager. She is now aged 26.

In the blog, named 'Where their wars are merry and their songs sad' she labelled mother of four Lady Colthurst,a 'psycho' and urged people to run away from her if they saw her.

Despite being 'live online' for five years, it only came to Lady Colthurst’s attention in the summer of 2011.

Ms Wilson said: 'The defendant's blog remained online
for many years.

'It only came to Lady Colthurst's attention in the 
summer of 2011 after she carried out a Google search on her name.

'Unsurprisingly, she was very distressed by the defamatory allegations.

'The claimant then discovered that 
various people had read the blog post over the years and, unfortunately,
that it remained sufficiently prominent on the internet that it was 
still being read up until it was removed, partially in September 2011 
and fully in March 2012.'

The High Court heard Sir Charles began a relationship with the mother of Rachel Myers, who made the allegations on her internet blog in 2005, when she was a teenager

Blarney Castle, home to the Blarney Stone. The court heard Ms Myers did not appreciate until this claim was brought how widely her blog had been read or how far her allegations might spread

She told the judge the allegations were untrue and Lady Colthurst, who now lives in Midhurst, Sussex, was not a danger to anyone including Miss Myers.

Felicity McMahon, counsel for Ms 
Myers, told Mr Justice Tugendhat: 'Ms Myers first published the blog 
post when she was 18 years old.

'After she was notified of the 
claimant's claim, she took steps to remove her blog from the internet 
and this was achieved some time afterwards.

'She did not appreciate until this claim was brought how widely her blog had been read or how far her allegations might spread.

'Ms Myers withdraws her allegations 
unreservedly and apologises to Lady Colthurst for the distress and 
embarrassment which this matter caused her.'

Ms Wilson said her client brought the proceedings to 'vindicate her reputation' and was pleased her claim was settled with the payment of damages and her legal costs.
