The partner of a paramedic who killed herself on the job has called for additional support as figures show an average of two ambulance officers commit suicide every year.

Helen Mok took her own life 18 months ago at an ambulance branch at Doncaster, west of Melbourne, where she had gained access to lethal drugs.

Her partner of 18 years, Cath Mok, said Helen's death came after years of increasing demands, long hours and the confronting line of work, which slowly and painfully impacted on her mental health.

'It was a job Helen once really loved and she worked so hard to get into it,' Cath told Daily Mail Australia.

'But as time went on it became something else. It became a much darker place.'

Helen's story is becoming less of an isolated case within the ambulance sector and will feature on SBS's news program  The Feed on Thursday night.

Cath, who had two young children with Helen, said a lot of people assumed the trauma Helen experienced related to 'picking body parts off the road' and 'scraping people back together'.

'But the thing that she found the most traumatic was seeing people calling them because of failures in other areas of the hospital. They were getting called to people with mental health issues that they couldn't actually fix.'

Helen started out loving her career as a paramedic but as the years went by it became a darker place, according to Cath

The pressures of shift work and the long hours expected of paramedics was also a major contributing factor to Helen's death.

'There's a lot of pressure for paramedics to continue working long after they're supposed to be finished,' Cath said. 

Ambulance Employees Australia secretary Steve McGhie told Daily Mail Australia the rising rate of suicides amongst paramedics was highly concerning.

'We've had 13 paramedic suicides (in Victoria) in the last seven years. It's really concerning to us because it used to be a rare occasion. I'm sure the other states would have similar numbers,' he said. 

'Pressures of the job, stress, strain, trauma and trying to balance work and family life would be the main factors.'

Cath says Helen loved being at home with their two children and was very active within their primary school community 

Cath said she was very open and honest about Helen's death with their children and used the words mental illness and depression to help them understand

Helen's manager had committed suicide a year before she took her own life. Another colleague did the same three weeks after Helen died.

'She used to share a lot about her job with me, but in the last few months she was really withdrawn because she was struggling with having to go to work,' Cath said. 

'We had a fight one night when she was really down. She said goodbye to the kids and left abruptly. When she didn't come I assumed she'd gone to a friend's to cool down... but she never came home.

'Two senior police officers and Helen's group manager came to the house the following morning. She'd been found in an ambulance branch.'

Dave Toll, who is also a paramedic in Victoria, said in the past six to seven years he has lost eight to 10 friends and colleagues to suicide.

But Helen isn't an isolated case within the ambulance sector. There's been 13 paramedic suicides in the past seven years in Victoria, according to Ambulance Employees Australia secretary Steve McGhie

Dave Toll, who is also a paramedic in Victoria, said in the past six to seven years he has lost eight to 10 friends and colleagues to suicide

'The fatigue, the 10 hours with no breaks, the 14 hour night shifts, the missing of family events. These guys are paramedics because they want to help people. It's why they do the job… and they push themselves too far,' Dave told The Feed.

Fellow ambulance officer Nicole said at first she wasn't aware of how her work was affecting her, but over time her view began to change.

'I had a bunch of suicide plans for when I got old. It's something that I've often talked to other paramedics about,' she said.  

Ambulance Victoria said they had ongoing plans to reduce these risks amongst employees. 

'Ambulance Victoria recognises the challenging environment that our paramedics operate in and take the health of our staff very seriously,' a spokesperson said via a statement.

David said 10 hours without a break and 14 hour night shifts took its toll on many paramedics

Fellow ambulance officer Nicole has admitted to making suicide plans for when she was older

'We have also commenced a research project to explore potential roster options that meet our service delivery while allowing for a reduction in shift length.

'Ambulance Victoria understands the risk of fatigue in the challenging environment that emergency services operate in.'

Cath has not made contact with Ambulance Victoria since Helen died, but is currently still urging the coroner to investigate her death.

'The cause of death wasn't a question, but the circumstances surrounding her death, I felt, needed to investigated,' she said. 

'I put in a request a month after she died and they still haven't decided.

'What I would hate is for nothing to change. It’s not just Helen, it’s all of the paramedics that working and all of those who have stopped working because they can’t handle it. 

'I feel dismay at the thought they won’t investigate. I don’t think it’s a safe place and it’s the responsibility of the employer to mitigate those risks.'

The Feed airs on Thursday nights at 7.30pm on SBS 2.
