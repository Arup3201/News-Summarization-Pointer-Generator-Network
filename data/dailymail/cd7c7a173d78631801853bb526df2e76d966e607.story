Most footballers spend their whole careers dreaming of getting their hands on it.

But it seems that, for one of Germany's players, the joy of finally holding the famous World Cup trophy was all too much.

The head of the German FA revealed yesterday that the gold trophy was damaged during his team's wild celebrations after they beat Argentina in the tournament's final earlier this month.

Captain Philip Lahm led the team in jubilant scenes after the Germans won football's most famous competition for the first time since 1990 in Brazil's Maracana stadium.

But the president of the country's football association, Wolfgang Niersbach, said a piece of the famous gold trophy was later 'chipped off' as the players showed it to fans back home.

He told Die Welt: 'At one point, a small piece of our World Cup trophy was chipped off. But do not worry, we have specialists on the case who can fix it.

'We have investigated persistently who it was that damaged the trophy, but the investigation was concluded without a result.'

The trophy, designed by Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga, was introduced in 1974 and the 5kg original, made from 75 per cent 18 carat gold, is said to be worth around £8million.

The trophy is believed to have been damaged as the team toured German capital Berlin on an open-top bus

The head of the German FA said an investigation was launched but it was unclear who had caused the damage

Luckily for Germany however, the trophy they were given to parade around Berlin was a replica given to them by football's governing body, Fifa.

The current trophy replaced the famous Jules Rimet trophy, which was given to Brazil after they won it for a third time at the 1970 World Cup.

The previous trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall ahead of the 1966 World Cup in England.

It was then famously found by a dog named Pickles under a bush in Norwood, south London before England went on to win the tournament.
