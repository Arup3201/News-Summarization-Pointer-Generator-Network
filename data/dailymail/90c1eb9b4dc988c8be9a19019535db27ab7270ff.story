Following a day full of crazy weather, wild winds and a whole lot of snow on Tuesday Mother Nature has now calmed down a little and the worst is said to be over.

The severe weather warning for Victoria has been cancelled, but is expected to be re-issued later in the week with a new cold front on the way.

The Victorian State Emergency Service received thousands of calls for help since the early hours of Tuesday, and more than 80,000 homes were also left without power across the state.

The severe weather warning for Victoria was downgraded on Wednesday but is expected to be re-issued later in the week

The State Emergency Service in Victoria have responded to over 3800 requests for help since early Tuesday

Trampolines being picked up by gusts of wind were a 'repeat offender' across NSW and Victoria

Most calls across NSW were for trees down and damaged roofs

SES spokesman Stephan Delatovic told the Daily Mail Australia 'all up yesterday we responded to 3800 calls for help.'

Mr Delatovic encouraged people to tie down outdoor furniture and said the SES 'did see quite a few jobs of trampolines and sheds lifted up by the wind and thrown around.'

'The effort of tying stuff down is much less than the heartache of dealing with damaged houses or injuries.'

He warned that despite the severe weather warning being lifted, coastal areas are still 'unpredictable and dangerous' as there had been cases of jettys and boardwalks being washed out.

The wild weather wreaked the worst havoc in Bacchus Marsh, Werribee, Point Cook, Bendigo, Bundoora, Watsonia North, Monbulk and the Mornington Peninsula, and a woman was injured when a brick wall fell on her in Yarraville.

In Mittagong, located in the Southern Highlands of NSW, a man has been airlifted to hospital after a brick wall fell on him.

The 10 metre high structure is believed to have collapsed due to high winds in the area.

Emergency services responded to the call at Cavndish St, Mittagong on Wednesday afternoon and the man in his 50s is in a serious condition after the accident.

He was trapped under the brick wall for over an hour-and-a-half, and was then flown by helicopter to Liverpool Hospital in a serious but stable condition, emergency services said.

The SES are still working through the backlog of calls for assistance, with more than 250 requests which still need to be attended to.

Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kevin Parkyn said the intense weather system affecting the whole state hits Victoria only once every few years.

'We're in for a windy week, so it's not over yet, although we have seen the most intense winds for the week,' Mr Parkyn said.

But despite the winds slackening, emergency services continue to urge Victorians to stay clear of coastal areas with the weather expected to worsen later in the week.

As for New South Wales, the state is still on alert and the State Emergency Service 'has received over 850 requests for assistance since yesterday morning,' according to their Facebook page.

A second wave of damage is set to sweep across the state on Wednesday, specifically in the Illawarra, Snowy Mountains, Southern Tablelands, Central Tablelands, and South Coast.

The Sydney Metropolitan area could also be hit, and blizzards are expected in the Snowy Mountains again with winds reaching up to 120 kilometres per hour.

Sue Pritchard, a spokeswoman for SES NSW said they've had more than 1000 requests for assistance and 'they're still coming in.'

'Illawarra and South Coast have been the worst hit with more than half the jobs there.' she said.

The majority of the requests for help are for trees down, roof damage and 'trampolines are a repeat offender,' Ms Pritchard said.

Surf and marine conditions are still extremely dangerous across both NSW and Victoria and people are being urged to stay out of the weather where they can.

Meantime, snow is continuing to fall in ski fields in NSW, with Perisher, which is 200km south of Canberra, reporting they have now had more than 120cm of snow.Â
