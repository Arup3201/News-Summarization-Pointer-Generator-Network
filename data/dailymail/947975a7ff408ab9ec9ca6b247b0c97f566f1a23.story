First picture: Housekeeper Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock outside an employment tribunal in Southampton which heard she falsely accused her employer, South Dorset MP Richard Drax, of trying to entice her into a threesome with his wife

This is the lesbian housekeeper who falsely accused a Tory MP of trying to lure her into a threesome with his wife.

Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock claimed she became suicidal after Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her as they drank wine in the sitting room of their Elizabethan stately home.

But her ‘cynical’ case was dismissed at an employment tribunal after her former lover revealed she was a serial litigant who falsely accused a previous boss of sexual assault and had been awarded £16,000.

Judge Roger Peters, rejected her ‘utterly incredible’ claims at the hearing in Southampton.

The South Dorset MP wept as the decision was reached, and said afterwards that the claims had been ‘extremely stressful’ for his family.

After the hearing on Wednesday, he said: ‘This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue.’

Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock, 53, who lived in the Drax ancestral home, has received two other payouts in the last 15 years after bringing claims against former bosses, the tribunal heard.

The housekeeper’s claims were dismissed when her estranged civil partner claimed that Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock had concocted the story for financial gain.

Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock, who is divorcing her, said her former partner wanted to ‘satisfy a grudge’ and that her attitude when she was in a dispute was one of ‘I have an issue with that person, how can I get them back?’

She said her ex had brought a claim against the Royal Mail involving an alleged sexual assault, receiving a payout of £15,960.

'She
admitted to me that she had been in a tussle of some sort with a 
colleague and that she had invented an allegation that he had touched 
her breast,' she said.

Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock received £15,960 after bringing the claim.

She
received another payout from the Royal Mail after alleging she had hurt
her shoulder after the company overfilled a bag.

'In fact it was an 
injury she had had for many years which was unrelated to her work,' her 
civil partner said.

She also received a £3,000 payout from a store where she was working after yet another dispute.

Her ex-partner added said she believed the case against the MP was another attempt to 'extract money from an employer'.

She told the hearing: 'She
knows Mr Drax is a public figure and I imagine she thought he was in a 
strong position to secure a settlement from him as I know she has done 
from previous employers.

'I 
believe she concocted the allegations in her claim to cause 
embarrassment to Mr and Mrs Drax and their family in the expectation 
that she would receive a financial settlement.'

Business leaders have now spoken out to say the case exposes the need to impose tougher penalties on workers who bring 'frivolous or malicious' claims with the hope of receiving a settlement.

Mark Littlewood, the director of the 
Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The
present system makes it too attractive for the complainant to simply 
chance their arm, often causing expense and even distress to their 
wholly innocent employer.'

Companies
last year settled more than a quarter of employment tribunal claims out
of court despite often being given legal advice that they were likely 
to win, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry.

A fellow MP last night praised Mr 
Drax's courage for fighting the case despite the 'pain, hurt and 
embarrassment' caused to him and his family.

Nadhim
Zahawi, the co-founder of the pollster YouGov who is now a Tory MP, 
said: 'It must have been horrific for him and his family, but it was 
absolutely right.

'When you think you are in the right, then you ought to take these things on.'

Earlier
this week, Mr Drax said the allegations had been 'extremely stressful' 
for him, his wife Elsebet and his four children with his ex-wife, the 
sister of former Royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

Mr Drax,
55, a Harrow-educated former Coldstream Guards officer whose full name 
is Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, had always denied the 
claims and described himself to the hearing as a 'courteous gentleman'.

The tribunal heard the housekeeper was invited to live in the Drax ancestral home, Charborough House, after previously working there as a groom.

She claimed that in August she was in the staff kitchen when Norwegian-born Mrs Drax invited her to join her and her husband in their sitting room.

She claimed when she entered the MP and his wife began to French kiss. Mrs Drax then started rubbing her crotch and her husband grabbed her thigh, she alleged.

The housekeeper said she was 'extremely upset and scared' by their approaches and fled to her room and barricaded the door.

A few weeks after the alleged assault, Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock said the MP told her she had an hour to leave, citing a series of fallings out she had had with other members of staff.

She said he gave her £300 and a letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up.

The housekeeper's former partner told the tribunal that when she spoke to her after she had been sacked by the MP, she boasted she had something 'big' on him.

The housekeeper had claimed sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and for unpaid holiday pay.

Mr Drax wiped his eyes as he sat holding his wife's hand as chairman of the panel, Judge Roger Peters, rejected her 'utterly incredible' claims.

Outside, the MP said. 'This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue.

'These allegations have been extremely stressful for my wife and I, and my children, and my family. We are all now relieved that we can put these matters behind us.'

A spokesman for the Forum of Private Business said: 'It is wrong that one angry employee can humiliate her boss, even if there are no grounds.

'We think the culture needs to change where somebody is to blame – and that is always the employer.'

Outside court, the housekeeper's solicitor said: 'We are sorry that she has not been able to prove her case at this tribunal and we will be considering an appeal.'
