Lifeguards at a California beach are mourning a historic training building which collapsed in the wake of Hurricane Marie

Cove House collapsed after waves generated by the hurricane compromised the pilings of the old building.

Cove House, located at scenic Sycamore Cove, in Point Mugu had served generations of lifeguards since the 1950s and ‘had seen it all’.

‘It’s a loss for the program from an emotional and administrative standpoint,’ Craig Sap, California State Parks' Angeles District superintendent told LA Times.

‘Some people came and stood by, mournfully watching the structure go.’

‘This thing was bulletproof, it had seen it all.’ Sap said about the building

The Cove House Lifeguard Administrative Building had become a popular filming location over the decades and featured in television series such as Baywatch.

The high surf generated by Hurricane Mare, later downgraded to a Tropical Storm, in the eastern Pacific rolled onto Southern California beaches again on Thursday night, showing signs of diminishing but still bringing warnings of possible property damage and dangerous rip currents.

No saving: The  Cove House Lifeguard Administrative Building had featured in several films and television series, including Baywatch  

However, meteorologists said the weather conditions had peaked and would gradually subside through Friday, with high surf advisories expected to expire that evening.

Tropical Storm Marie was spinning more than 800 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was expected to be further downgraded to post-tropical cyclone status Thursday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

The storm was moving toward the northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds dropping to 45 mph.

Surging surf arrived on the Southern California coast late Tuesday and was wildest on Wednesday.

Blocks of oceanfront homes flooded in low-lying Seal Beach south of Los Angeles, pilings were knocked off the Malibu Pier and a boatyard on Santa Catalina Island was battered.

Warnings or advisories were posted for hundreds of miles of coastline. The National Weather Service called it the region's most significant southerly swell event since July of 1996.

Lifeguards worked to keep all but the most experienced surfers and swimmers out of the water but still made hundreds of rescues.

Beaches were left with deep gouges and abrupt drop-offs more typical of the aftermath of winter storms than summer.
