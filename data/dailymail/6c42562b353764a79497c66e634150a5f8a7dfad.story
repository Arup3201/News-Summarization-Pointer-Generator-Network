Same-sex couples seeking the right to marry are asking the Supreme Court to settle the issue of gay marriage nationwide.

Appeals filed Friday urge the justices to review last week's lower court ruling that upheld laws aligned against gay marriage in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.

The first petition – called a writ of certiorari – came in response to Ohio rulings that upheld statewide bans on recognizing out-of-state gay marriages, and also denied an out-ofstate adoption ruling issued in favor of a same-sex couple.

The Supreme Court receives about 10,000 such writs every year and only a tiny fraction are acknowledged or acted on.  

SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE SUPREME COURT PETITION 

Supporters of same-sex marriage have gained legal traction in recent years and now hope a Supreme Court ruling will bring about a final decision on the thorny question of whether gays and lesbians can expect to have marriages legally recognized alongside those of traditional opposite-sex couples

Religious groups oppose gay marriage and hold an annual march in Washington – this year on June 19 – to show their political clout; they believe marriage between one man and one woman is critical for society because children deserve the love and care of both a mother and a father

The Lambda Legal Foundation, a gay rights advocacy group, teamed with the American Civil Liberties Union to file the appeal.

The decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati, was the first appellate to side with states seeking to preserve gay marriage bans since the Supreme Court struck down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law last year.

Last month, the justices rejected appeals from five states of rulings favoring same-sex couples, but that was before the recent ruling created a division among lower courts.

Same-sex couples can marry in 32 states, parts of Kansas and Missouri, and the District of Columbia.

The Kentucky and Michigan cases involve the right of sex-same couples to marry. 

The Ohio appeal focuses on the state's refusal to recognize out-of-state gay marriages because of its own ban, while the Tennessee case is narrowly focused on the rights of three same-sex couples.

In asking the Supreme Court to reverse the 6th circuit, the plaintiffs in Ohio pressed the argument that states should be forced to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. 

The 6th circuit ruling "robs married same-sex spouses and their children of dignity and legal respect from cradle to grave," Cincinnati attorney Al Gerhardstein wrote.

Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said lawyers for the state would review the appeal. "The Ohio Attorney General's Office had previously stated that it did not anticipate opposing a Supreme Court review of the same-sex marriage issue," Tierney said.

The speed with which the appeals are being filed – eight days after the ruling – indicates the court could take up and decide the issue this term, by the end of June. That's if it takes the cases at all.

The states have a month to respond. If they don't seek extra time, the gay marriages cases should be before the justices for their first private conference in 2015, on January 9.

If the court decides then to hear the cases, there should be time to schedule arguments in late April. The justices would have two months to write their opinions.
