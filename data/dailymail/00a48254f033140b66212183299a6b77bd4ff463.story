A family of six was dramatically rescued by coastguards after two parents risked their lives to save their children who had been swept out to sea by a 'very strong' rip current.

The mother, father and their four 
children were dragged out to sea after being hit by a freak tidal surge which was 
up to five feet high at Mawgan Porth, north of Newquay in Cornwall.

Two RNLI lifeboats, a helicopter, air ambulance and a cliff rescue team were immediately called as the parents desperately tried to reach their children as they were swept further and further out.

The mother battled strong currents to swim out and grab hold of her nine-year-old daughter before dragging her back to the shore.

Then a surfer, who had been enjoying 
the waves, leapt into the sea and battled the strong pull of the current
to reach the couple's 14-year-old son and plucked him out of the 5ft 
swell.

The father, meanwhile, had been 
sucked several hundreds yards into the sea where he managed to push one 
of his girls, aged 16, on to rocks in the hope she would be able to 
cling on.

He was swept even further out, 
however, with his 11-year-old daughter, but managed to cling to a rocky 
gully and stay afloat until the lifeboats arrived.

When rescue teams arrived, they found the 16-year-old being pounded by waves which were described by coastguards as ‘boiling’.

The girl was able to tell her rescuer where her father and younger sister were and the inshore lifeboat went to their aid.

The family, from Stoke on Trent, were safely reunited on the beach amid emotional scenes.

These remarkable pictures show the 
aftermath of the rescue with the family, who have not been identified, 
clearly distressed by their ordeal.

The father is bleeding from a wound 
on his leg and his daughters look shocked and tearful as they make their
way to the safety of the beach.

The incident happened at Mawgan Porth in Cornwall as the family were enjoying the first day of their holiday.

Witnesses claim the surf was up to five feet, with floodwater from the River Menalhyl flowing into the sea.

Last night coastguards said the 
family were lucky to be alive after they decided to take a dip after the
lifeguards had gone off duty on Monday evening.

Roger Mason from Falmouth Coastguard 
said: ‘They were very lucky indeed. It could have been a completely 
different outcome - it could have ended in tragedy.

‘We don’t advise people to go into 
the water if they don’t know the area. If they do go into the water they
should only use beaches that are attended by lifeguards.’

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said floodwaters and a five foot surf had combined to create a huge rip current.

A spokeswoman said: ‘Before the 
rescue units arrived on scene, the mother of the family had rescued her 
nine-year-old daughter, and a local surfer, in an outstanding effort 
against considerable surf and current, rescued a 14-year-old boy.

‘Further out the father had managed 
to push his 16-year-old daughter onto a rock but he and his 11-year-old 
daughter were swept further out to sea.

‘A rescue swimmer entered the water and reached the 16-year-old girl who was being pounded by waves.

‘Before he brought her back to the 
beach she was able to tell her rescuer where her father and sister were 
as they could not be seen from the shore.

‘As the rescue swimmer brought the 
girl back to safety the Newquay inshore lifeboat rescued the remaining 
two casualties who were clinging to rocks in a gully.’

Paramedics from South West Ambulance 
assessed the five casualties, who were cold and shaken but did not 
require further medical treatment. The mother required no assessment.

The family, who are a camping holiday, returned there after being discharged by paramedics.
