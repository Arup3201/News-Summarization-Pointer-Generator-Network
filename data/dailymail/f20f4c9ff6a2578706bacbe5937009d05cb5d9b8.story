Domestic violence is more prevalent in suburbs with more bottle shops and pubs, a government inquiry has found.

The hearing, which was submitted by The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), concluded that the only way to adequately protect women and children is by tackling alcohol abuse.

It revealed that over half of all police call outs for domestic violence involve alcohol.

FARE chief executive Michael Thorn said 'It's important  that alcohol advertising does not promote sexist attitudes,' since the majority of domestic violence is committed by men

Chief Executive of Fare Michael Thorn told Daily Mail 'domestic violence has been an issue on our radar for many years.'

'The narrative goes that where alcohol is involved you see higher rates of domestic violence, as well as a greater severity in the attacks.'

The results showed that in Melbourne, a 10 per cent increase in liquor stores over the past decade has amounted to a 3.3 per cent increase in family violence rates in the same areas.

In Western Australia, violence in homes increased by 26 per cent for every additional 10,000 litres of alcohol sold.

'There are strong socio-economic links. Alcohol companies are targeting the poorer suburbs by opening more liquor outlets there. This is something which urgently needs to be addressed.'

Thorn says that advertising and marketing agencies also need to be pressured in order to curb domestic violence.

'Alcohol advertising remains to be very blokey, often broadcast in correlation with sporting events.

'The reality is that domestic violence is a very complex issue with some fundamental gender dimensions.The vast amount of perpetrators are men.

'It's important with this in mind that alcohol advertising does not promote sexist attitudes.' 

Mr Thorn says that government co-operation is vital in addressing the issue.

'The government should be looking more seriously at preventative measures. I think alcohol treatment and domestic violence services should be working together on the issue.

'Lastly, we need to tighten up on any discounted booze sales. The biggest influence on alcohol abuse is the price, so addressing alcohol tax would have an significant effect also.'

 'Overall, we need to acknowledge that the availability of alcohol is contributing significantly to domestic violence.
