Jailed: Derek Gates has been sentenced to prison for heroin possession

A heroin addict has been condemned by a judge for abusing  and dealing in drugs after his life was saved by an NHS heart transplant operation.

Derek Gates, 38, was cleared for surgery by doctors even though his heart problems were caused by drug addiction.

But instead of mending his ways, he responded by stepping up his criminal behaviour.

Gates went back on heroin, became a dealer and committed 23 drugs offences in a seven-year period after his transplant.

Yesterday the case provoked outrage as transplant survivors questioned whether the drug addict should have been given his new heart  above others on the waiting list.

Gates was jailed for 18 months at Hull Crown Court on Monday.

The recorder, Rachim Singh, passed sentence after hearing police found £430 worth of heroin as well as cannabis and valium tablets in his flat in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, last month.

Mr Singh told Gates: ‘Quite what an individual who has had a heart transplant is doing with these type of drugs defies explanation.’

Gates will be allowed to visit his hospital cardiologist from prison. He has refused to co-operate with probation workers who want him to quit drugs.

The court heard details of his criminal history, mostly dating from after his transplant 12 years ago.

Gates has 32 previous convictions, which include 23 drugs offences committed from 2006 onwards.

He is no stranger to prison, having been jailed for two-and-a-half years in 2009 for supplying Class A drugs.

His medical history means he cannot be sentenced to do community work since the authorities are unable to get insurance for him.

In 2001, aged just 26 and already an addict, he had the heart transplant. It is understood that he needed the operation because his body had been severely damaged by drug use.

His failure to seriously attempt to give up drugs meant the judge was left with little alternative to a prison sentence.

As someone with a history of drug abuse he would have had to adhere to ‘strict conditions’ before being cleared by medical experts for a transplant.

He would have had to convince doctors of his ability to kick the habit, an NHS spokesman said. However, there was anger yesterday about a £40,000 operation being given to a drug addict.

Ashleigh Leybourne, 28, whose daughter Scarlett underwent a heart transplant as a baby, said: ‘I don’t think he should have been given the heart in the first place.

‘That organ could have gone to someone
 else who couldn’t help the fact they were ill and could have used the 
heart so much better. Scarlett didn’t choose to be in need of a new 
heart, neither do millions of people.

'I think it’s disrespectful to the 
donor, the donor’s friends and family and to all of the medical staff 
who performed the operation and helped him recover.’

Ruth
 Skinner, 67, of Sudbury, Suffolk, suffered from a condition that caused
 her heart to swell and received the heart of a 17-year-old boy in 2000.

Commenting on the case, she said: ‘I think what this guy has done is absolutely awful.

‘He
 has been given this wonderful chance and he has abused it. There  are 
so many people who really need a heart transplant and will die if they 
do not get one.

'For him to take a heart transplant when there are so 
many other people waiting is just so selfish. How will the families feel
 of the person whose heart he inherited?’

Gates
 also appeared in court in February after being caught with £340 worth 
of heroin. Police arrested him as he attempted to swallow evidence.

The
 court heard he was dealing to pay for his daily fix and the recorder, 
Mark McKone, let him off with a suspended sentence and a warning.

He
 told Gates: ‘If you continue to use heroin, not only will you spend 
time in prison, it will kill you. Your body cannot take it much longer.’

But Gates was back in 
court on Monday for sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of 
drug possession and possession of a knife in a public place.

His
 barrister Richard Thompson told the court that his transplant was a 
result of the drug abuse and referred to his medical condition in an 
attempt to avoid a jail term.

‘He
 is a man of poor health,’ he said. ‘You will see from his medical 
records that Mr Gates is a heart transplant patient who requires 
medication and regular contact with medical services. All these matters 
are making him anxious about going into custody.’

Mr Thompson said his client was also worried about how his girlfriend, who is pregnant, would cope without him.

He said Gates had used ‘seven bags of heroin a day’  at one time and was dealing to pay for his habit.
