With modern advertising boards showing video clips, messaging passersby and even interacting with viewers, it is difficult for a classic billboard to stand out.

However, one board in Pennsylvania has been attracting attention after displaying odd slogans and messages as part of an art project.

Jon Rubin, 50, and fellow academic Pablo Garcia contact an artist each month and ask them to write a message for their billboard, which is then displayed using heavy wooden letters.

Jon Rubin, 50, and Pablo Garcia have taken over an old-fashioned billboard in Pennsylvania as an art project. In this post 11-year-old Maude Liotta wonders about what to post on her new blog

Charlie Humphrey used his message in April this year to take a swipe at social media and Facebook users

This message, written by Joshua Beckman, displayed his phone number. If people called him, he would read verse to them, or listen to poems they wanted to read

The notes, which have ranged from witty 
remarks to short poems and even two phone numbers, then stay up for a 
month before being replaced.

One artist wrote the word 'Poem' in front
 of his phone number, then read verse to anyone who called or listened 
to poems they wanted to read to him.

Another artist also displayed his phone number with only a question mark above it, before speaking to people about a topic chosen by them.

'He said the majority of calls were from people who wanted advice,' Jon added.

The messages, which are displayed on a metal rack and made using wooden letters, are left for a month before being taken down. This one, by Packard Jennings, was the first to be shown in January last year

Jon says his favourite messages are self-referential, such as this one which offers stubborn viewers the chance to say sorry without having to actually say it

Another artist, Marc Horowitz, also put up his phone number and spoke with callers over the course of the mother it stayed up. He said most of them phoned asking for advice

Other messages have included a swipe at 
Facebook, a mad plan to announce births and deaths from a loudspeaker on
 hospital roofs, and one note which simply read: 'These words hold no 
power over you.'

While most of the submissions come by direct invitation from Jon or Pablo, they do occasionally take ideas via email, or directly from the internet.

One of the most bizarre came from an 11-year-old girl who wrote: 'Ideas for my new blog: Who invented tape, how were feelings discovered, when did '"skinny" become fashionable?'

The project is called The Last Billboard as a nod to the changing nature
 of advertising and text in general.

Jon asks artists for messages to display on the boards, as well as collecting notes from around the internet. This post, by Anthony Discenza, appeared last month

In May Adam Frelin displayed this mad plan for loudspeakers on hospital roofs to make public announcements

Forgotten: This downbeat display remembers all of the hours that went into forgotten labours of love

'Billboards like this take hours to
 erect and they stay there for a month,' said Jon who believes ads such 
as these will soon become obsolete.

He added: 'A month is a long time in today's 
world of instant digital messaging.'

Jon was educated at California College of Arts and Crafts, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and Ohio State University and has exhibited work across the US and abroad.
