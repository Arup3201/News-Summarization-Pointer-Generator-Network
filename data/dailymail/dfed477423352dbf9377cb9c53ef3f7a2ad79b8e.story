Borussia Dortmund maintained their unbeaten record in this season’s Champions League with a 4-1 victory over Galatasaray but the result was overshadowed by the visiting fans throwing fireworks onto the field of play.

Galatasaray fans set off firecrackers, smoke bombs and flares, interrupting the match briefly twice. 

Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead in the 39th-minute and defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos doubled the lead in the 56th-minute of play.

Hakan Balta pulled one back for Galatasaray with 20 minutes reamining, the first goal Dortmund conceded in four group-stage games. 

But Ciro Immobile then scored his third Champions League goal in the 74th-minute, before Semih Kaya deflected a shot by Immobile into his own net for the final score five minutes before the final whistle.

Dortmund lead Group D with 12 points while Arsenal lie second with seven points, after drawing 3-3 with Anderlecht.
