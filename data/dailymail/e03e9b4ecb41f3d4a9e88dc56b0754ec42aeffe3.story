Dog the Bounty Hunter has been beaten to tracking down a dangerous convicted felon who had jumped bail.

Ricky Wheeldon, 53, was caught by state troopers in the early hours of Wednesday morning after they received information of his whereabouts.

Wheeldon, 53, did not resist arrest when police stopped the truck he was traveling in, after he spent five months on the run in Jackson, Michigan.

A handgun and drugs were found in the vehicle, police said.

It will come as a stinging blow to the Dog, otherwise known as Duane Chapman, who is the 'world's greatest bounty hunter', according to the network which films his TV series.

He has made more that 6,000 captures in his 27-year career.

Dog had been in Jackson 
since the beginning of October, helping Leo's Bail Bonds track down 
Wheeldon in order to recoup their $500,000.

Duane 'Dog' Chapman 'is the greatest bounty hunter in the world', according to his TV series.

He has a wide range of merchandise from T-shirts, mugs and hats printed with dog's face to a Halloween costume where fans can dress in his signature, distinctive look.

Dog has made more that 6,000 captures in his 27-year career.

Chapman was born in Denver and once was an inmate himself, serving time in a Texas prison.

Dog credits law-abiding citizens with helping him track down dangerous fugitives which has included serial rapist and Max Factor heir, Andrew Luster.

Chapman currently lives in Hawaii with his wife Beth, also a bounty hunter, and three of his children.

Leo's Bail Bonds already had paid the court 
$100,000 and were due to hand over another $100,000 if Wheeldon was 
still on the run in December.

Now that the fugitive is behind bars, Leo's Bail Bonds will not have to pay out any more money - but the business is not able to get its original $100,000 back.

It is also unlikely that Dog will be paid a  commission.

Leo Urban, who owns the bail bonds firm, 
watched in court as Wheeldon was sent back to the Jackson County Jail 
where he will remain until sentencing.

Mr Urban later told mlive.com that Dog and his wife Beth, also a bounty hunter, had arrived in town at the start of October at his request.

He praised their assistance in being able to get people talking about the whereabouts of the suspect.

Mr and Mrs Chapam were filming for their next TV series, for which they are reportedly paid $200,000 per episode.

Wheeldon had bolted during the final 
day of his trial in May but had been convicted of nine felonies, 
including theft and running a drug ring, in his absence.

The convicted felon was back in court
on Wednesday where Judge Thomas Wilson gave him a sentencing date of 
November 29.

Wheeldon appeared to have attempted 
to alter his appearance while on the run, the judge said as his hair and
mustache were shorter.

The criminal said he had applied to have a court-appointed attorney when he appeared before the judge in shackles today.

He is expected to serve a lengthy sentence if not life in prison, Jackson County prosecutors said.

Michigan State Police had tracked Wheeldon to a home in Leslie, a small town in Ingham County.

Officers were preparing to search the house, when a truck pulled away from the property at around 12.45am.

Although there was not a 'high speed chase' police said, the situation was potentially dangerous at the two men in the truck were armed.

The 62-year-old driver was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and harboring a fugitive.
