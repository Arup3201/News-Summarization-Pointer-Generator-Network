A man from Houston managed to reel in a fish so large that he will have his name inscribed in the Louisiana record books.

Cullen Greer caught a 297-pound Warsaw Grouper in around 500 feet of water.

At the time of the catch, Mr Greer was some 35 miles away from land and next to an offshore rig in the Gulf Of Mexico.

Big fish: Cullen Greer caught a 297-pound Warsaw Grouper while next to an offshore rig in 500- to 600-feet of water

The grouper was 6ft 6in long and six feet in girth and when it was brought back to shore, Mr Greer was dwarfed by the sea-swimming giant.

Mr Greer told KETK he reeled in the huge fish after battling with it for half an hour. He used live bait to hook his catch

The fish is likely to be the third largest Warsaw caught on a hand crank fishing line.

The overall record currently stands at 359.1 pounds and was caught in November 2008.

It took him 30 minutes to reel the grouper onto his boat

But still falls short of record local catch made in 2008
