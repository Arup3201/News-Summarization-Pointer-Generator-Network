A man who was declared clinically dead for 40 minutes was brought back to life thanks to a machine which performed life-saving chest compressions. 

Colin Fiedler, 39, from Dandenong, in Victoria, Australia, was pronounced dead at The Alfred Hospital last June after he suffered a heart attack. 

But thanks to a revolutionary cardiac support machine, called the AutoPulse, staff were able to revive him.

Life-saver: The Zoll Auto-Pulse keeps blood and oxygen flowing to vital organs

He told the Herald Sun: 'I am so grateful, more than I could ever say'.

The Zoll AutoPulse, which is battery operated, is a portable heart and lung pump which keeps blood and oxygen flowing to vital organs. 

A patient's head, shoulders and upper back lie against a board while a band, which carries out chest compressions, is strapped around the person's entire rib cage.

When the patient is strapped in and the start button is pressed, the band pulls tight around the chest and constricts the entire rib cage, rhythmically pumping the heart at a rate of 80 compressions per minute.

Manuel chest compressions, even when done well, only provide between 10 and 20 per cent of normal blood flow to the heart and 30 to 40 per cent to the brain. 

But this new pump moves more blood more consistently, according to experts.

The Herald Sun reports that Fiedler is one of seven cardiac arrest patients in Australia who have been treated with the band.

Three have been revived from being declared clinically dead for 40 to 60 minutes, it said.

AutoPulse machines have been on the market since 2003 and are being used more and more around the world.

Zoll, the company which makes the device, said: 'Victims receive more consistent, high-quality compressions than those delivered by simple automated CPR devices, which means improved blood flow.'

The U.S. National Centre for Biotechnology Information said a recent study on the effectiveness of the machine showed that it had a 'promising' future.

Twenty nine patients who took part in the study received more blood pressure than they would have with manual compressions.

In 2010, Arun Bhasin, 53, was found lying unconscious in Croydon after suffering a cardiac arrest.

Doctors hooked him up to a Zoll AutoPulse pump which maintained Mr Bhasin's heartbeat for more than three hours while he was stablised by medics.

At the time, Nigel Raghunath, lead consultant in A&E, who treated Mr Bhasin said he had never seen such a remarkable case in his 15 years in Accident and Emergency care.

He said: 'Even a fully-trained professional finds it hard to deliver consistent, high quality chest compressions when attempting to resuscitate someone whose heart has stopped beating.

'A&E teams have a range of equipment available but the new device means we can carry on helping someone’s heart to beat for much longer improving blood flow to vital organs and increasing their chances of recovery.'
