A police force has sparked confusion by recruiting an army of garden gnomes in a bid to fight summer crime.

The 10 ornaments - in police uniforms - will act as the centrepiece of a new campaign to highlight the danger of theft, drink-driving and shoplifting.

Blasting the move by Durham Police as 'baffling', Andy 
Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance said the public need real actions, not stunts.

Bizarre: Durham Police have recruited 10 garden gnomes to communicate safety warnings to the public

He told Mail Online: 'The public want bobbies on 
the beat, and will be somewhat baffled that instead they've received a 
series of amusing garden decorations.

'Gnomes are not, as far as I'm aware, particularly well-known for their crime-fighting ability.'

The force will be unveiling one new gnome a week, with each representing a different type of crime.

Stunts will include officers placing the 
gnomes inside cars which have the windows left open - and they will then
 post pictures on the force’s Facebook page.

Anette Metcalfe, partnership liaison officer at the force, said that the gnomes were a fresh idea to get the message out.

'It’s a little bit different,' she said. 'We have had a problem with thefts from gardens and we run a campaign ever year called Summer Nights, so we wanted to do something different.

'It’s just a bit of fun with a serious message. We are asking people to point to all 10 as each represents a different type of crime.

'If officers see a car is insecure, we have a couple of spare gnomes who may just end up sat on the driver seat of that car,' said Anette.

'A gnome will be put on the driver’s seat while officers take a photo.

'That photo will then be put onto our Facebook pages to help raise awareness.'

They will then use a tool called Hawkeye and the car’s details to send a letter to the owner to show just how dangerous leaving a car unlocked is.

Each week, a new gnome will be placed around the city of Darlington, in various shops, to get people thinking about crime.

The unique gnomes - all named after TV police detectives - will address a different crime such as road safety, cycle security, neighbourhood watch, drink driving and shoplifting.

PC Gene Hunt, the first gnome to be 
deployed by the force, is named after the star of Life on Mars and will 
alert drivers to the risks of leaving their cars unlocked.

Some will come with a QR code that 
residents can scan to be taken to a website, such as Durham police or 
Crimestoppers, where they can find all the relevant information.

Chief Constable Mike Barton is hoping that people will act on the advice of the gnomes.

'Although the introduction of the gnomes is light-hearted and a bit of a gimmick it also has a real purpose for us,” he said.

'These gnomes are going to be placed across Darlington with serious messages and it would be great for people to go out and find them.'

Residents who spot all ten gnomes will also be entered into a prize draw, which shops in the area have contributed prizes to.

The initiative was rolled out last week and will run over the summer months in conjunction with the town’s business improvement district and the gnomes created by Darlington business, Dekra Crete, free of charge.
