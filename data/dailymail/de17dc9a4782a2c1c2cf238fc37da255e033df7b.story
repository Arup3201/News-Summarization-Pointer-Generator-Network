A woman believed to be a British medical student who left the UK in order to join ISIS  has posted an image on social media of herself holding a severed head.

The woman, who goes by the Twitter name of Mujahidah Bint Usama, claims to be a doctor for the terror group based in Raqqa, Syria.

In the image, which was used as her profile picture but has since been removed, she can be seen wearing a full burka and white lab coat while holding the head of a man.

A British medical student calling herself Mujahidah Bint Usama, 21, posted this image online of her holding a severed head while two children look on (censored by MailOnline)

To the left of the image, two children can be seen standing beside her.

Her name reflects her jihadi convictions, with Mujahidah appearing to be the female version of mujahadid - meaning soldier of God.

Bint translates as 'child of', while Usama likely references Osama Bin Laden.

The gruesome image appears alongside the message 'Dream job, a terrorist doc,' followed by images of smiley faces and love hearts. 

According to The Sunday Telegraph, she is a 21-year-old British medical student.

Bint Usama, who has more than 800 followers on the social media site, has previously tweeted images of dead soldiers and the 9/11 terror attacks, alongside information on how to treat an injured knee and insomnia.

GCHQ and MI5 are known to be monitoring the accounts of around 60 female British jihadis who are believed to be in Raqqa in order to put together a picture of their activities.

The Government has previously stated that those who take part in atrocities such as beheadings and massacres will be prosecuted for war crimes and terror offences if they return to the UK.

In other online messages Bint Usama praised Anwar al-Awlaki, an extremist Yemeni preacher who became an Al-Quaeda spokesman and is believed to have inspired hundreds of Western jihadis.

She also praises women to push their husbands into fighting for Islam, and shared images of the execution of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, who was beheaded by ISIS earlier this month.

Sixty female British jihadis are now thought to be with ISIS, including Aqsa Mahmood, 20 (left), who is believed to be leading the al-Khanssaa brigade in Raqqa, and Zahra Halane, 16, who fled the UK with her twin sister

Bint Usama has been linked through her Twitter account to the al-Khanssaa brigade, an all-female group of jihadists who are charged with punishing 'un-Islamic' behaviour by women in Raqqa.

The name likely derives from Al-Khansa, a famous 7th-century female poet and contemporary of the Prophet Muhammad who converted to Islam and wrote elegies for his brothers, father and children after they were killed in battle. 

This week members of the brigade, which is thought to be led by British extremists, were reported to be acting as madams running brothels filled with captured Yazidi women, according to the Mirror. 

As many as 3,000 women and girls have been taken captive from the Yazidi tribe in Iraq as Isis militants continue their reign of terror across the region.

The think tank MEMRI (the Middle East Media Research Institution) released a report saying that IS had taken many Yazidi women to be sold and used as sex slaves.

The al-Khanssaa brigade is a female-only militia set up by the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria, with a key figure believed to be Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of Glasgow, who fled to the country last year. 

Academics at King's College London have identified three other British females as members of the group - and say there are about 60 UK women who have gone to Syria on jihad.

Most of these women - including privately-educated Mahmood - are aged between 18 and 24, with al-Khanssaa said to be seeking out people engaging in Western culture in Raqqa.

It is believed that US hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff were both beheaded in the desert near Raqqa - and therefore the British women in al-Khanssaa could know who killed them.

All of the women are thought to be based in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria (pictured), where the female al-Khanssaa brigade has been established to punish un-Islamic behaviour among women
