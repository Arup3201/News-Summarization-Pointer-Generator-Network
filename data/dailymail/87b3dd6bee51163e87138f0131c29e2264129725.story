Andy Murray has been spotted out and about for the first time since landing in Heathrow on Tuesday after the tumultuous Australian Open.

But his four-set defeat to Novak Djokovic was a world away as he went for a snowy dog-walk with fiancee Kim Sears.  

The couple strolled with their border terriers Maggie May and Rusty near their home in Surrey.

This is the first sighting of the pair since landing in Heathrow after Murray's four-set defeat in Melbourne

Murray lost his fourth Australian Open final to Djokovic in Melboune on Sunday 

The walk will no doubt have done wonders for their jet lag after a 24-hour flight back from Australia, which is 11 hours ahead of the UK.

It was only on Sunday when Murray was in Melbourne being beaten in his fourth final there by Djokovic.

Ever gracious in defeat, Andy tweeted after the match, 'Ready to take off back 2 London.Thanks 2 everyone @ausopen for making it such a special event, well done on number 5 Novak incredible record.'

Adding once he landed: 'Thanks to everyone who's been supporting me and believing in me after a tough year. I'll keep working hard to get better....Treat yourself. 

Sears herself was caught up in a controversy herself down under, appearing to swear on camera in Murray's semi-final win over Tomas Berdych, before wearing a shirt at the final which had 'Parental advisory: explicit content' written on it.

Despite his defeat to Novak Djokovic, Andy seemed to be in good spirits, smiling and chatting on the walk 

Kim was in charge of the dogs as they strolled on the snow-covered grounds, leading the Border terriers 

After their long walk, the pair were seen climbing back into a grey Land Rover

The pair, who recently became engaged, are keeping a low profile after the Grand Slam at their Surrey home
