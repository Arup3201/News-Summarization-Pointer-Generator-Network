The parents of a young woman who died after a heated row while alone with her violent ex-boyfriend said yesterday they were still seeking justice for her after a coroner recorded an open verdict.

Rebecca Day, 23, was heard by neighbours in the flat below to shout ‘get your hands off me’ before a woman screamed.

There was then the sound of furniture being moved and silence, an inquest heard.

Rebecca Day, 23, known as Becky, was found hanged in her flat in Hull, 
East Yorkshire, just after neighbours heard her shout 'get your hands 
off me', an inquest has heard

Minutes later Liam Scott, 28, banged on their door to say Miss Day had tried to commit suicide. She was found lying fatally injured on the floor of an airing cupboard with a washing line rope hanging from above.

Phil Day, Miss Day's father, attended the inquest into his daughter's death at Hull Coroners' Court where assistant coroner Rosemary Baxter recorded an open verdict

Miss Day died a day later in hospital. A post-mortem examination revealed she suffered a fatal brain injury caused by hanging.

The coroner recorded an open verdict after stating the evidence indicated two possible explanations – suicide or the ‘potential intervention of another party’. Miss Day’s parents don’t believe she took her own life. Her engineer father Philip Day said after the hearing in Hull: ‘Anybody who listened to the evidence will be able to make their own conclusions.

‘I want the investigation to carry on until my daughter receives justice. She deserves justice.’

The inquest was told that weeks before Miss Day died last December Mr Scott had completed a four-month jail sentence for an attack in which he broke her nose. The popular waitress was ‘petrified’ of Mr Scott, who had repeatedly beat her during their three-year relationship. However, she was said to be in good spirits after starting a relationship with another man and had arranged for Mr Scott to collect his belongings from her flat in Hull.

The inquest was told Mr Scott gave contradictory accounts of his actions that night and lied by claiming he had been drinking and smoking cannabis in the flat with Miss Day. Toxicology tests on her blood were clear.

The pair were heard arguing in the hours before Miss Day was found dying early on December 29. Joseph Goodwin, who lived with Helen Everitt in the flat below, said: ‘I heard him shouting something about her having another boyfriend. He shouted “you won’t be going out with him tomorrow”.’

Liam Scott, 28, raised the alarm after Miss Day was found hanged. He had been released from prison one month earlier after attacking her

Just before 1am he said he heard Miss Day shouting ‘leave me alone, get your hands off me’. Mr Goodwin said: ‘Immediately after that I heard a scream like I had never heard before.’ Furniture was also heard to be moved and ‘then it went really quiet’.

Miss Day’s mother Michelle Coates questioned Miss Everitt about Mr Scott’s account to police that he and his ex-girlfriend had not been rowing, but he had dozed off on the sofa and woke to discover her.

Mrs Coates asked: ‘You say you heard arguing before he banged on the door, but he said he was fast asleep?’ Miss Everitt replied: ‘He lied, he lied.’

Mr Scott had told his neighbours he went out to buy beer and returned to find Miss Day hanging. He then changed his story and claimed he had fallen asleep. He refused to give evidence but a statement from him was read.

Mr Scott was questioned on suspicion of murder and released without charge. Police said yesterday the inquiry was complete and the scientific evidence didn’t support that he could have hanged Miss Day.

But coroner Rosemary Baxter said there was insufficient evidence to conclude ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ she committed suicide. She said the evidence ‘doesn’t fully and sufficiently disclose’ how Miss Day came to die.
