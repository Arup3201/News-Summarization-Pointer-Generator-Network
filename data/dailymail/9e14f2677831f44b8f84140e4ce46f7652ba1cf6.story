Consumers borrowed a record-breaking £8.4billion on their credit cards last month

Consumers borrowed a record-breaking £8.4billion on their credit cards last month, official figures revealed yesterday.

More than four million transactions a day are being processed in the UK, with some people using their card to pay their mortgage or weekly food shop.

Experts warned the figures, from the British Bankers’ Association, raise fears that millions are ‘surviving day-to-day’ on credit.

Overall, the figures show the total that Britons owe on their credit card, has reached an all-time high of £38.7billion.

In August 2007 – the month the credit crunch began – £7.2billion was borrowed on credit cards and the total outstanding was £29.4billion.

The BBA said the credit card boom is a sign of a ‘growing consumer confidence’ among Britons following a time when they were too scared about the future to take on debt.

But debt experts warn spending on credit cards is a classic sign of financial distress because it is one of the easiest ways to obtain money.

Unlike a personal loan, which must be approved by a bank or building society, it is easy to borrow money on a credit card, typically ‘maxing out’ the card by borrowing up to your credit limit.

Mark Sands, head of bankruptcy at the accountants RSM Tenon, said ‘the more desperate type of borrowing’ is done on a credit card, rather than other types of borrowing.

He said: ‘Those who are still struggling are using credit card debt as a way of surviving day-to-day.‘If you have kept a couple of credit cards in the bottom of your drawer, but you’ve now lost your job and your bills are going up, you can max out your credit cards.

The credit card boom is not the only sign of millions of people being forced to rely on debt to survive.Wonga.com, the controversial pay day loan firm, is handing out 10,400 loans every single day, lending up to £1,000 which arrives in your bank account within minutes.

Just six years since it launched in this country, the company provided 3.8million loans last year, a rise of nearly 60 per cent on the previous year, according to its latest financial figures.

Around 60 per cent of people with a credit card pay off their balance in full every month, according to the UK Cards Association. The average person typically has two credit cards.

But this leaves 40 per cent of people taking on debt which they cannot afford to repay until they have been charged a crippling interest bill.

A spokesman for Step Change, the debt charity, said many people are ‘having to resort to using their credit card simply to cover their essential household bills.’

He added: ‘We know that people will often over-estimate their ability to repay borrowing and that this can leave them in a deeper financial hole.

‘Lenders need to ensure that credit is being lent safely and appropriately and that it does not exacerbate existing financial vulnerability.’

Dr Howard Archer, chief UK economist at the consultancy IHS, said the toxic combination of pay freezes or a lack of decent pay rises for many years leaves many with no option but to use their credit card.

He said: ‘It is likely that markedly improving consumer confidence means people have become more prepared to borrow in recent months.

‘It may also be that the squeeze on consumer spending coming from inflation running well above earnings growth means that some people are having to borrow more to finance any major spending.’

Mortgage lending continues to rise, with the number of loans handed out to buy a home last month [aug] jumping by a quarter, compared to the same month last year.

In August, there were 38,228 house purchase loans, the largest number since the end of 2009, according to the BBA. Many are saddling themselves with super-size mortgages, with house prices reaching record highs in many parts of the country.

The average mortgage to buy a home is £156,800, compared to the country’s average full-time salary of £25,600.
