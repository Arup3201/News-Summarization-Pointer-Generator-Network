A 'remarkable and rare' Iron Age chariot has been uncovered during an excavation in Leicestershire.

Archaeologists discovered the bronze chariot fittings, along with horse care tools from 2nd or 3rd Century BC, at an ancient fort in Burrough Hill.

Experts believe the chariot was either dismantled or never built, and would have belonged to a high-status individual such as a noble or warrior.

The bronze remains of the 2,200 year old chariot were found at Burrough Hill, an Iron Age fort near Melton Mowbray. In this image a chariot linch pin from three angles, showing the intricate decoration at the ends

The archaeologists who found the treasures are said to be shell-shocked by the enormity of their discovery.

The decorated fittings from the 2,200-year-old Iron Age chariot appear to have been buried as a religious offering.

Researchers also unearthed what are thought to be equestrian tools, including an object that was probably a grooming comb and two curved blades which may have been used in the care of horse hooves.

The discovery was made by students from the University of Leicester during their ongoing excavation of the Burrough Hill Iron Age hillfort, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. 

Parts of the chariot are decorative with Celtic-style designs. In this image are a selection of chariot fittings including a miniature terret ring (a metal hoop for a horse harness) on the upper left, a large terret ring (upper right), strap junction (lower left) and barrel-shaped harness fitting

Around 2,000 years ago, Leicestershire's settlements were built on top of hills rather on on the lowland plains as they are today.

Archaeological excavations have found that Leicestershire’s Burrough Hill, Breedon Hill and Beacon Hill were once all ancient hilltop settlements, known as hillforts. 

From the fifth century BC and throughout the Iron Age, hillforts flourished throughout central and western Europe. 

The three examples in Leicestershire are some of the best-preserved hillforts in the UK, and tremendous feats of engineering for their time. 

Burrough Hill, where the chariot was uncovered, is about five miles south of Melton, and is Leicestershire’s largest hillfort. 

It may have once been the ancient capital of the East Midlands’ native tribe, the Corieltauvi and a key economic centre. 

From, Burrough Hill ancient Iron Age warriors would have been able to see other important  sites, such as Breedon. 

There is also evidence the area  has been occupied by humans since the early Bronze Age, around 4,000 years ago. 

While digging a large, deep pit near the remains of a house within the hillfort, four students found a piece of bronze in the ground, before uncovering more parts nearby.

Taken together, the pieces are recognisable as a matching set of bronze fittings from a mid to late Iron Age chariot.

After cleaning, decorative patterns could be seen in the metalwork, including a triskele motif showing three waving lines which is similar to the flag of the Isle of Man.

The parts include chariot linch pins and other fittings, including rings, straps and what was described as a barrel-shaped harness fitting.

'Realising that I was actually uncovering a hoard that was carefully placed there hundreds of years ago made it the find of a lifetime,' she Nora Battermann, who was among the students who made the discovery.

The pieces appear to have been gathered in a box before being planted in the ground on top of a layer of cereal vase and burnt as part of a religious ritual.

The case might have doubled as a 'cushion' for the box and also the fuel for the fire.

After the burning, the entire deposit was covered by a layer of burnt cinder and slag, where it lay undisturbed for more than 2,200 years until the team uncovered it.

The discovery was made by students from the University of Leicester during their ongoing excavation of the Burrough Hill Iron Age hillfort (pictured), near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire.

The archaeologists believe the chariot would have belonged to a high-status individual and the burial may have taken place to mark a new season. 

Dr Jeremy Taylor, who lectures in landscape archaeology at the university, said: 'This is a matching set of highly decorated bronze fittings from an Iron Age chariot - probably from the 2nd or 3rd century BC.

'This is the most remarkable discovery of material we made at Burrough Hill in the five years we worked on the site. This is a very rare discovery, and a strong sign of the prestige of the site.

'The atmosphere at the dig on the day was a mix of "tremendously excited" and "slightly shell-shocked",' he said.

'I have been excavating for 25 years and I have never found one of these pieces - let alone a whole set. It is a once-in-a-career discovery.'

The co-director of the project, John Thomas, said iron tools were placed around the box before it was then burnt, and covered in a thick layer of cinder and slag.

'The function of the iron tools is a bit of a mystery, but given the equestrian nature of the hoard, it is possible that they were associated with horse grooming.

'One piece in particular has characteristics of a modern curry comb, while two curved blades may have been used to maintain horses hooves or manufacture harness parts.'

The parts have been taken to the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History for further analysis. The archaeologists hope they will be put on public display in due course.

Before then, they will be on temporary display at the Melton Carnegie Museum, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, from October 18 to December 13.
