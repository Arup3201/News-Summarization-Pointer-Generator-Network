Once every office and most homes in the UK rattled and rang with their unmistakable sound but today marked the end of an era for the humble typewriter.

The last one to be made in Britain has been taken off the factory floor as Brother stopped manufacturing the machine at its north Wales factory.

The company has made 5.9 million in Wrexham since 1985 and has sent its last typewriter to the Science Museum in London to be displayed as an artefact.

Historic: Edward Bryan, a worker at the factory since 1989, made the last typewriter and is shown here doing a final test on the production line

After 130 years it is has finally become a victim of the computer-dominated world as Brother said demand in Britain had fallen to the point where it was no longer financially viable to keep making them.

Edward Bryan, a worker at the factory since 1989, made the last typewriter.

'If people ever ask me, I can always say now, as a strange question, that I’ve made the last typewriter in the UK,' he said.

'I have made so many typewriters down the years. I once managed to make one with my eyes closed.'

The company said that it still had significant sales in the U.S. - where government departments and some offices still use them - but Brother's factory in the Far East produces enough typewriters to serve this market.

Despite its British-sounding name Brother is a Japanese company from Nagoya that started life in 1908 as the Yasui Sewing Machine Company.

It was given an English title, Brother, in 1954 to establish itself in the international market.

Four years later a European division was set up in 1958 in Dublin and ten years later moved its UK headquarters to Audenshaw in Manchester after they bought the famous Jones Sewing Machine brand.

In 2012, Brother's annual turnover was in excess of £3.8bn per year with its main manufacturing centres in China, Taiwan and soon Vietnam.

It still does have production in the UK and is also well known for sponsoring Manchester City between 1989 and 1999, still one of the longest shirt deals in UK football history.

The company will continue to use the Wrexham factory to run a recycling scheme for printer cartridges as well as to make other office technology.

UK boss Phil Jones said the typewriter still held 'a special place in the hearts' of members of the public.

He said: 'Because of this, and the typewriter’s importance in the history of business communication, we felt that giving it a home at the Science Museum would be a fitting tribute.'

Typewriters were first mass produced by the Remington company in the 1870s.

The Science Museum’s assistant curator of technologies and engineering, Rachel Boon, said staff were excited to add the item 'to our rich collection of typewriters' which numbers more than 200.

She said: 'This model will enable us to tell the story of how technology has evolved in accordance with our communication needs.'

The first known typewriter was invented in the US in 1830 by William Burt.

But typewriters did not become a commercial success until the 1870s when inventors Christopher Sholes - who also invented the Qwerty keyboard - and Carlos Glidden made a deal with the Remington company to mass produce their machines.

The first recorded idea for a typewriter is dated 1714 when an Englishman called Henry Mill patented his idea for "an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another."

However, it wasn't until 1808 that Italian Pellegrino Turri built the first working machine of its kind. Turri made the typewriter for his friend Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzano, a story which was the basis of a novel by Carey Wallace published in 2010.

It wasn't until 1870 when Danish pastor Rasmus Malling-Hansen invented his 'writing ball,' that production of typewriter-like machines began on an industrial level. 

Typewriters as we know them now started to circulate after the introduction in 1874 of the Sholes & Glidden Type Writer in the USA.

This machine brought in the QWERTY keyboard, and was designed by Milwaukee journalist, poet, and part-time inventor Christopher L Sholes.

The QWERTY keyboard was designed to solve problems during printing, separating frequently-used pairs of type-bars so that the type-bars would not clash and get stuck at the printing point.

The Sholes and Glidden looked very like a sewing machine and had limited success on the market.

The Remington later became the commercial leaders in typewriters and is the basis of all such machines since.

It was the Underwood typewriter that captured the market place for the coming decades.

By the 1920's all brands were an imitation of the Underwood, which boasted frontstroke, QWERTY, typebar machines printing through a ribbon, and the  one shift key and four banks of keys.
