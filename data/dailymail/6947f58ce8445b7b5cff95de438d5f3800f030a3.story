Thousands of British air passengers were stranded abroad last night as the chaos caused by striking French air traffic controllers worsened.

Many were forced to sleep on the floors of airports in Mediterranean resorts as they awaited news of rescheduled flights. Some face being stranded for a week.

Amid ‘nightmare’ scenes at popular holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal, flights were cancelled with no warning in the early hours of the morning, leaving parents to struggle with crying children as they awaited news.

Delays: Passengers at Stansted Airport faced delays as striking French air traffic controllers caused chaos across Europe, causing delays and cancellations for flights to France, Spain and Portugal

Frustrated travellers complained of a lack of information from airline staff.

Even when staff were able to provide details of a rescheduled flight, they admitted there was no guarantee it would not also fall victim to the strike.

With the walkout due to last until Monday, many travellers were facing the prospect of waiting until next week to be flown home, prompting angry scenes at some airports as holidaymakers queued for hours only to receive little concrete information.

Airlines including Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways were forced to book thousands of emergency hotel rooms for stranded passengers.

On the second day of the walk-out, airline bosses accused the militants of holding them to ransom and called for staff from neighbouring countries to take over French airspace.

Airlines have been ordered to ground up to a quarter of flights that would normally use French airspace.

Problems intensified yesterday after air traffic controllers in Belgium also walked out.

EasyJet, which has cancelled 300 flights over two days, said it had booked 2,800 hotel rooms to deal with passengers unable to fly home. Ryanair cancelled around 250 flights for the second day in a row. British Airways cancelled 30 flights.

Kenny Jacobs, marketing chief at Ryanair, said EU governments needed to get tough on French air traffic controllers to stop them ‘holding people to ransom’ with their annual walk-outs.

‘It’s a disgrace,’ he said. ‘The French need to sort this out. Ronald Reagan had the right idea when he broke the air traffic controllers’ strike in the USA by sending in the military to run it.

‘Strike action by air traffic controllers should be made illegal. And if they do go on strike, neighbouring EU countries should be able to operate the airspace over France to keep planes flying.’

An easyJet spokesman said: ‘We have booked around 2,800 hotel rooms to date and some passengers will also have booked their own accommodation and will claim it back from us.

‘We are advising passengers on cancelled flights to either claim a refund or re-book after the strike period has finished.’ That will see some heading back in the middle of next week at the earliest.

Among those stranded is Sophia Ali, 31, from London, who had been in Ibiza for a friend’s wedding when her flight home was cancelled without warning. ‘The scenes at the airport were horrendous,’ she said. ‘Some people were swearing and kicking off. As soon as the flight was cancelled the internet went down so you couldn’t get information.

‘One guy had been in Ibiza for a stag do and was getting married in a couple of days’ time so had to get back for the wedding. But he couldn’t. He was beside himself.’

Chemistry student Liam Stephens, 22, risks missing his graduation at Bath University next week because his flight home from Portugal to Bristol was cancelled last night.

Queues at UK airports were less severe than on Tuesday because airlines had ‘pre-cancelled’ most of the affected outbound flights overnight and alerted passengers in advance by text or email.

The strike is over job cuts as part of an EU plan for a ‘single European sky’.
