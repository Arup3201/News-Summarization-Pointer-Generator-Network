Nine players and a coach were ejected from the stadium after a mass brawl broke out during a minor league baseball game, delaying the game by 15 minutes.

Players clashed on the pitch after running off their benches in a Triple-A game between the Albuquerque Isotopes and the Reno Aces in Reno, Nevada.

The riot erupted when Reno batter Erisbel Arruebarrena reacted furiously after claiming that Aces pitcher Mike Bolsinger had thrown the ball at his body.

After striking out, Arruebarrena shoved Reno cather Blake Lalli, prompting players from both teams to pour onto the field.

Arruebarrena threw his helmet at one player, who responded by tackling him to the ground with the help of two colleagues.

Around 20 players then started throwing bats, helmets and punches as they wrestled behind the backstop, with some being pushed into netting which separates the spectators.

Aces manager Phil Nevin, who was one of those ejected, insisted he had simply been trying to break up the melee before it spiralled out of control.

He told Milb.com: 'I think that's kind of my job, to break things up. I'm too old for that stuff.

'It was pretty tough for me to get guys away when guys are throwing bats and helmets at people.'Â 

When the two sides finally separated, the umpires handed out ten ejections.

They included Arruebarrena, Lalli, pitchers Andrew Chafin and Kameron Loe, left fielder Aaron Cunningham and first baseman Mike Jacobs.

Walter Ibarra and pitchers Carlos Frias and Yimi Garcia from Albuquerque were also thrown out.

Mr Nevin said: 'I understand they (the umpires) have got a job to do. I just took exception to my catcher being thrown out.

'We lost three guys from our line-up and I didn't have that many guys out there to begin with.'

Despite that, the Aces went on to win 7-3 over the visitors.
