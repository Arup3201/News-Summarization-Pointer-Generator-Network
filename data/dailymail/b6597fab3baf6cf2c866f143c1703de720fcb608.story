Beach lovers and music fans rushed to make the most of the fast-fading sunshine across the country today as Britain braced itself for a wet weekend.

Events such as the T in the Park festival in Scotland got off to a bright start today - but with the threat of looming clouds which were set to put a major dampener on the fun in the coming days.

Forecasters predicted damp conditions sweeping in throughout Saturday - while commuters in the capital got an early taste of rain with a wet voyage to work.

The downpours are set to begin in Northern Ireland this afternoon before rolling across the sea to the north-west of England and western Scotland.

By the middle of the weekend they could threaten the rest of the country, with East Anglia and southern England risking thunderstorms on Saturday.

London commuters this morning got an early taste of what was to come, as they trudged through the capital in their thousands against incessant showers.

Umbrellas held against the skies, the City's workers hurried towards their offices, with no great hopes to weekend sun to cheer their moods.

Although many of England's state school pupils are still set to stare gloomily out of their classroom windows for the best part of a fortnight, a host of private school children were set to finish today, joining Scottish children who have been on holiday for weeks.

Gareth Harvey, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'Today a lot of places are seeing spells of sunshine, but there's more cloud down in parts of eastern England with some rain towards the south-east at the moment.

Threats: Clouds can be seen in the sky behind these festival-goers at T in the Park in Balado, Kinross

Sun for now: Attendees were looking forward to performances from Scottish artists including Biffy Clyro and Calvin Harris

Indomitable: Revellers happily posed for the camera as Scotland's biggest music festival got underway

'But later
 today there's another front that's going to start coming in from the 
west, which will introduce some more clouds which will give us bits and 
pieces of rain in Northern Ireland. This evening it will start moving to 
the west of Scotland.

'Tomorrow
 there's rain moving in to northern and western areas, most persistent 
in Scotland, while parts of eastern England will experience sharp 
showers and developing thunderstorms.

'On
 Sunday that rain will sweep its way easterwards overnight. It will 
clear most of the country through Sunday morning, except for Scotland 
where it will hang on into the afternoon, where it will stay quite wet.'

The
 rain will be particularly troubling for those north of the border, 
where 85,000 revellers at the T in the Park festival faced the uncertain
 outlook as they prepared to be regaled by Scottish rockers Biffy Clyro 
and DJ Calvin Harris.

Chilled out: Sunglasses were the order of the day this morning at the festival - but they may not stay that way for long

The 
festival in Balado, Kinross, could be blighted by rain as it gets fully 
underway. Though revellers were enjoying dry conditions this morning, by
 Saturday things were set to take a turn for the worse.

On
 the festival weather, Mr Harvey said: 'At T in the Park, Saturday will 
have a dry start, but probably around noon we'll start to see spells of 
rain moving in from the west.

'This
 is likely to turn heavy at times in the afternoon. It will stay there 
through the evening, through the night, and probably into Sunday morning
 as well.'

England's
 cricketing hopes at Trent Bridge, where the national side is locked in a
 test match with India, could also be threatened by the weather.

As
 the team started today trailing India by more than 400 runs, the 
prospect of a shower over the stadium in Nottingham 'could not be ruled 
out'.

And though the sportsmen looked likely to escape the advancing rains on Saturday - which will probably hit after play finished - the final day of the test match on Sunday risks morning showers before a clearer afternoon.

The most extreme weather in the country looked to focus on the South East, where thunderstorms are due to batter areas around East Anglia from the late afternoon through to the evening.

Bright start: There were clear skies this morning in Ross-on-Wye, Wales, but showers were expected later on

Threatened: Showers are set to move in from Saturday, dampening the weekend for many

Across the
 country disappointing temperatures seemed the order of the day, with 
highs of just 26 Celsius expected in areas lucky enough to dodge the 
rain.

Sunday looked particularly dampened, with national highs of just 22 degrees, amid 'humid' conditions, forecasters said.

But despite dampened prospects for the weather in Scotland, revellers seemed in high spirits and prepared to make the most of the music at T in the Park's last year in its current location.

Pharrell Williams, Ellie Goulding and 
Elbow will play to a daily crowd of 85,000 at the three-day event. The 
line-up also includes Paolo Nutini, Ed Sheeran and Jake Bugg.

This year marks the end of an era for T in the Park at the Balado airfield, home to the festival for the past 18 years.

Organisers
 said this weekend's event will act as a 'huge send-off party' before a 
move to the Strathallan Castle estate in Perthshire in 2015.

Performers
 over the weekend include the headliners of T in the Park's first year 
at Balado - The Charlatans and Paul Weller - with both acts taking to 
the stage 18 years to the day after they performed at the festival's 
debut in Kinross.

The Manic Street Preachers, Kaiser Chiefs and the Pixies will also take to the stage.

The campsite gates opened last night, with crowds turning up early to grab the best spot for the festival, now its 21st year.

Festival
 director Geoff Ellis said: 'This weekend, we mark the end of an era. 
The Balado site has never looked more beautiful, and we're getting ready
 to give our much-loved home for the past 18 years the incredible 
send-off it deserves.

'We're really looking forward to celebrating 
one last time here with the greatest audience in the world, and can't 
wait to welcome you all as we throw Balado a farewell party.'

More 
than 2,800 artists have played Balado over nearly two decades, including
 Foo Fighters, The Stone Roses, Rihanna, The Killers, The Who, Daft 
Punk, Kylie Minogue, Oasis, Beyonce and Eminem.

Biffy Clyro have played the most times, with their main stage headline set tonight taking their total performances there to 10.

It may be an unenviable weekend ahead for many - but overall the British summertime has come up trumps for winegrowers, who could win out over rivals in traditional heartlands like France and Spain.

The European countries have been battered by storm winds and hail over the past months, while growers in English regions such as Cornwall and Hertfordshire have boasted of 'perfect' conditions.

The onslaught has destroyed up to 80 per cent of some Pinot noir and Chardonnay crops in Burgundy and led one winemakers' association to declare the season 'a catastrophe'.

Meanwhile British growers are set to export record numbers of bottles - and demand has never been higher.

UK winemaker Sam Lindo will compete this summer against France's top champagne producers for the title of international sparkling winemaker of the year after becoming the first Brit to reach the final three.

Perfect conditions: Winemakers in England have been enjoying ideal weather - in contrast to French and Spanish growers. Pictured is the Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin, Cornwall

Sam, who owns Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin, Cornwall, said: 'We've had a brilliant year for our wine.

'If the sun shines, everything flowers and there's no particularly bad weather between now and October, then we could make up to 200,000 bottles.

'On a bad year we can make 50,000. In England we accept that we have bad years from time to time but in Burgundy they'll not be used to having such a bad season.

Vineyard 
owner Simon Day said English wine used to be considered a joke by 
continental rivals but is now good enough to compete globally.

He
 said: 'English wine used to be a bit of a joke. The French, Italian and
 Spaniards - the stereotypical wine-growing countries - would say, "the English can't make wine".

Growing: The good weather in past months means British winemarkers are hoping to export more than ever

'Some
 of the pictures I've seen of the devastation in Burgundy and France 
have been absolutely horrific. Storms can be quite localised and some 
vines have been completely stripped bare.

'Obviously
 storms and strong winds are something English winegrowers are aware of 
too but it's just been the right weather at the right time for our wine.

Mr Day runs 16 Ridges Vineyard in Ledbury, Herefordshire, where he hopes to produce 60,000 bottles from this summer's crop.
