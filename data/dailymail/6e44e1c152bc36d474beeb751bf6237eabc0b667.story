John McAfee, the eccentric antivirus software mogul-turned-fugitive, will be calling Portland, Oregon, home for the next 18 months.

The 67-year-old founder of the company that bears his name arrived on American soil from Guatemala in December after spending months on the run from authorities in Belize.

Until last fall, the technology titan had been living in the Central American nation, but fled after police sought to question McAfee in connection with the killing of his neighbor, a fellow American expat.

New home: John McAfee, the illusive and eccentric antivirus software mogul-turned-fugitive, arrived in Portland, Oregon, where he plans to stay for the next 18 months

Fleeing from the authorities, McAfee went into hiding, but continued blogging about his unfolding adventure, detailing how he had faked a heart attack and used disguises to elude his pursuers.

Shortly after crossing into Guatemala with the help of a decoy, as he wrote in his blog last month, McAfee was detained and deported to Miami.

During a 12-minute interview with CNBC on December 14, the software mogul media
said he has not done drugs in 30 years, but if he did, he has ‘the 
resources to do good drugs’ and not bath salts, which he said were for 
‘people that don’t have a lot of money.’

He told ABC News the same week that he was left with no money or valuable property after playing the 'crazy card' and faking an illness in Guatemala to avoid being sent back to Belize.

On January 9, the international man of mystery unexpectedly appeared in Portland, posing with strippers at Mary’s Club during a photo-shoot organized by a British paper.

McAfee later set down for an interview with the local publication Willamette Week, revealing that he plans to spend the next year and a half working with a local artist, Chad Essley, to create a graphic novel about his life.

This is just the latest bizarre development in the McAfee saga.

This week, The Hollywood Reporter
revealed that Warner Brothers will be making a movie about the oddball 
software pioneer, and has secured the rights to a profile of him that 
was published in Wired Magazine last year.

John
Requa and Glen Ficarra, the duo behind the 2011 hit comedy Crazy, 
Stupid Love starring Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling, will write and 
direct the adaptation.

While
speaking to reporters in Portland, McAfee, who at one point was worth 
as much as $100million, shared some of his unusual ideas about money.

‘What
you want to do with your money that you get is cling on to it and own 
it, and money doesn't want it,’ he said. ‘Money is the free flow 
movement of energy called capital, and if you're just a vacant hole, 
money will flow through you like crazy.'

When
asked by his interviewers what will he do if he becomes destitute, the 
67-year-old who already had claimed to be poor, was unfazed.

Back in the U.S.: John McAfee talks to the media last week outside the boutique Beacon Hotel in Miami

Dressed to the nines: McAfee walks out of the Beacon Hotel in Miami on Thursday. He said U.S. authorities have made no efforts to question him since he arrived

‘I'm
an open hole and money will flow through me, I promise you, it always 
has,’ McAfee said. ‘And when I lose it, it's fine; it's money's 
business, not my business.’

The
amorous fugitive, who famously blogged about living with eight 
prostitutes, also had some unusual things to say on the subject of sex.

‘I
found that the more ugly the woman, the better the sex,’ McAfee 
offered. ‘The best sex in the world in the librarian who hasn't had a 
date in 10 years but has read all he love books.’ 

These
latest insights into the mind of the quixotic antivirus innovator 
should come as no surprise to those who have been following McAfee’s 
ordeal.

In the past, the 
67-year-old had accused Belizean political elite of setting him up for 
the murder of Greg Faull and said the local police poisoned his dogs and
attempted to kill him.

In a
particularly bizarre twist, McAfee blogged earlier this month that 
Belize was training Lebanese terrorists in a partnership with Hezbollah.

The Belize government maintains that McAfee is not a suspect in the November murder.
