A couple admitted they are terrified of entering their bathroom after spotting a rat in the toilet.

Margaret, 59, and Keith Woods, 67, of Sutton, south London, now flush their lavatory first and run the taps before going to the toilet, after the rodent apparently began swimming up the u-bend.

The couple filmed the rat - which they have named Roland - poking its face up into the bowl, but investigators from Thames Water have done a search of the pipes at their home without success.

'Petrifying': The couple filmed the rat - which they have named Roland - poking its face up into the bowl

Worried: Margaret, 59, and Keith Woods, 67, of Sutton, south London, now flush their lavatory first and run the taps before going to the toilet, after the rodent apparently began swimming up the U-bend

Mrs Woods said: ‘I went to the loo and I could hear scratching. I jumped up and thought - this time I’m going to watch. I flushed the toilet straight away and went back, leaving the light on.

‘It was rearing its ugly head. In March I gave Thames Water two weeks to sort it out. We kept hearing scratching and we’d put the lid down. We are petrified to go to the toilet.’ 

The office manager added: ‘We flush the toilet and run the tap to be able to go to the toilet.’

The couple, who have lived in their home for 27 years, have experienced rat problems in the past and said they have had a rat in their toilet for the last eight months.

Last October, when Mrs Woods was on 
holiday, she received a panicked phone call from her daughter, who was 
pregnant at the time, telling her that a rat had escaped from the 
toilet.

Her daughter said the rodent got out 
into the bathroom until her son managed to get rid of it. Since then a 
rat has been popping his head out most nights, much to the horror of the
Woods family.

Looking down: Mrs Woods has contacted both Sutton Council and Thames Water, but said she has become frustrated with the lack of a solution and delays on the part of the water company

Mrs Woods has contacted both Sutton 
Council and Thames Water, but said she has become frustrated with the 
lack of a solution and delays on the part of the water company.

Thames Water apologised for delays in conducting a probe of the sewage network - which was finally carried out two weeks ago.

Following a similar incident of a rat found in a New York City toilet in January 2011, Brooklyn Pest Control exterminator Eddie Marco said it was a problem he had often dealt with.

He told Gothamist: 'The pipe is empty, the rat crawls through the pipe and up over the hump and into the porcelain. And he can’t get back out. What I do? I flush it down.'

Experts recommend squirting dishwasher liquid around the inside of the toilet bowl if you spot a rat inside, and to flush the lavatory many times.

A spokesman said: ‘This is unacceptable and we have let Mr and Mrs Woods down.'

He added: 'A CCTV investigation of the sewer was done last week and the network is working as it should. We have also carried out a thorough clean of the sewer pipes around the property and will putting down some poison to help the customer get rid of the problem.'

David Cross, pest control firm Rentokil's head of technical training, said: 'Thankfully, this is still a very rare occurrence, but we have seen more of these cases in recent years.

'Rats are an ingenious species, and they will do anything within their power to access new sources of food. After navigating a u-bend for the first time, the rodents become more confident and will often make repeat visits to the same property.

'Use of one-way valves in the manhole chamber can provide - amongst other things - an additional barrier for rats by denying them access to the soil pipe.'
