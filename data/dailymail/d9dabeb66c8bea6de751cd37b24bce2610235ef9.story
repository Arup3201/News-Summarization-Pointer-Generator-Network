The right-wing extremist who massacred 77 people during a twin terror attack in Norway had plastic surgery to make him look more Aryan, according to a intelligence official.

Anders Behring Breivik, 32, has the blond hair, blue eyes and strong features stereotypically associated with the group.

However, according to Janne Kristiansen, the head of Norway's intelligence agency the PST, there is no way that Breivik's look was natural.

'You
 do not have that Aryan look naturally in Norway,' she said.

Aryan: Anders Behring Breivik had plastic surgery to get closer to the Nazi physical ideal

'Hitler would have had him on posters. He has the perfect, 
classic Aryan face.

'He must have had a facelift,' she added in an interview with The Sunday Times.

This information fits with the 
reminiscences of an old schoolfriend, who has recalled that Breivik 
boasted of having had plastic surgery a decade ago, a time when he had 
befriended 'a group of people obsessed with their bodies'.

'I remember we were at a party, and he 
told me he had had his nose and chin operated on by a plastic surgeon in
 America,' the friend told the Sunday Telegraph.

The revelation comes at a time when the full extent of Breivik's British connections is coming clear as it emerges that he sourced some of his bomb-making equipment from the UK.

An investigation into how Breivik acquired material to make the car bomb which killed eight people in Oslo has revealed that he used online auctioneer eBay to buy ingredients from all around the world, including Britain.

Bizarre: Breivik says this red jumper is the only item of clothing he will wear when he goes out in public

Using the name 'andersbrei', Breivik bought a pound of sulphur from a supplier in north London, while the 'hazmat' suit he wore to mix chemicals was purchased from a Briton now living in the U.S.

Andrew Christou, who sold Breivik the sulphur, said that when he realised his unwitting involvement in the attack, 'my shock and horror was multiplied 10-fold'.

Breivik, who is believed to have considered targeting other high-profile sites in Norway such as a royal palace and the headquarters of the Labour party, has made bizarre demands about his time in prison and in court.

He has requested not to be given halal meat and, having been refused permission to wear a military uniform, he says he will only wear a red Lacoste jumper during his public appearances.

Norwegian investigators are currently going through the 1,500-page 'manifesto' which he posted online before attacking Oslo and the island of Utoya. Officials believe it may be deliberately cryptic in order to perpetuate Breivik's mysterious image.

'He wants it to be like a Da Vinci Code novel,' said one source. 'He has created a mystery and as long as that mystery is there his message will remain in the public domain.'

Breivik's links with the far-right 
English Defence League have also become clearer, as it emerged that he 
was a member of the Norwegian Defence League, an offshoot of the British
 group.

Lena Andreassen, a former leader of 
the NDL, confirmed that Breivik had been a member of the group, which is
 led by British football hooligans, but said: 'I kicked him out because 
he had extremist views.'

Meanwhile, a senior EDL member has come under attack for starting a debate on which 'liberal twits' deserved to be executed.

Alan Lake, who claims to be the EDL's 'events director', ran an article on his extremist website predicting that Britain would 'start to fragment into Islamic enclaves', according to the Observer.

Lake then encouraged his readers to suggest names of those who should be forced to live in those enclaves, 'and who we will execute if they sneak out.' He nominated David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Rowan Williams, but later removed the post.
