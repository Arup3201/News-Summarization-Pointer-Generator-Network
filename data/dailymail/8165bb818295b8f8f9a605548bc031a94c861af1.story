Football Association chairman Greg Dyke will back moves to bring video replays in to help referees for key decisions such as awarding penalties.

Dyke is uncertain about FIFA president Sepp Blatter's idea to allow managers a number of challenges to referees' decisions but believes video replays should be brought in.

The FA has a powerful voice as it has one of the eight votes on the International FA Board (IFAB), the game's law-making body, along with Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and FIFA, which has four votes. The IFAB is due to discuss proposals in March.

Greg Dyke agrees with Sepp Blatter that referees should get to use video replays to get decisions right 

FA chairman Greg Dyke doesn't think a challenge system is the best way forward, unlike the FIFA proposals

Dyke told Sky Sports News: 'I for instance would allow a referee to go straight to the cameras [replay] for a penalty but you can't do that for every decision or the match would never finish.

'You don't want to throw the game away - you have seen in rugby where referees hardly make a decision about tries now, that wouldn't be a good idea for soccer but I do think use of technology should be considered carefully.

'In 10 years' time I think we will look back and think "wasn't it quaint we didn't use technology to help make certain decisions".'

Asked about Blatter's idea for allowing challenges by coaches, Dyke added: 'I'm not sure about managers being able to throw in the towel and say 'we want to challenge that'.

Sepp Blatter has announced his intention to run again as FIFA President at the age of 79 next year

'I do think the laws on technology will change but it will take time and we have to do it slowly, try certain things and see if it works because you could disrupt the game completely if you are not careful.'

Meanwhile, Dyke reiterated his view that it is 'a mistake' for Blatter to stand for a fifth term in office but did not back the one other person who has said he will stand for FIFA president, the French former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne.

Dyke said: 'I think it's a mistake, I don't think he should be standing. He stood last time on the basis that he would not be standing again. He is 78 and will be 82 or 83 when the term finishes and it always good to let younger people have their time.

'The FA would like to see another candidate and a proper competition. The FA will decide who it supports at a later stage if we think there is a serious candidate but he [Blatter] is probably going to win if anybody stands anyway.'

England were unable to sell out Wembley against Norway and face another low attendance for San Marino

Dyke also said the pressure that had been building on England manager Roy Hodgson had been totally lifted by the 2-0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland.

'You could feel the pressure building up on Roy and that one result has killed it. It was a very good performance and our younger players played very well in what was the hardest match in the group.

'We now have a very good chance go to France with a young side and hopefully do well.'

Dyke admitted that England's next home match against San Marino would be 'a hard sell' to fans, but added: 'It would have been a much harder sell if we had not won in Switzerland. San Marino's a hard sell at the best of times.'
