Lone suspect: Police arrested 19-year-old college student Ashton Sachs in the February double murder of his parents in Southern California

The 19-year-old son of a married 
couple found shot dead in their luxury Southern California home last 
month has been arrested and charged with his parentsâ€™ murders.

The
 Orange County Sheriffâ€™s Department said Friday that Ashton Colby Sachs 
was booked for investigation of double homicide and is being held 
without bail.

Authorities say Sachs is a college student in Washington state and lives in the Seattle area.

Bradford
 and Andra Sachs were found shot to death February 9 inside their nearly
 9,000-square-foot San Juan Capistrano mansion valued at $3.7million. Their 8-year-old adopted son was
 also shot but survived.

Authorities found no signs of a break in. They have yet to identify a motive.

The couple, who had five children, filed for divorce more than a decade ago but continued to live and run several profitable ventures together.

The bodies of Bradford Sachs, 57, and Andra Sachs, 54, were found February 9 in the bedroom of their sprawling Pepperdine Bend home in Orange County home following the 2am shooting.

Following his arrest in San Diego Thursday, Ashton Sachs was described by police as a 'lone suspect' in the killings.  

Orange County Register reported the Ashton Sachs had no previous run-ins with the law.

Ashton Sachs had been attending college in Washington state and lived in Seattle since 2013. His older brother, Myles, was away at school at the time of the murders, but their two teenage sisters and the eight-year-old brother were home. 

According to court records obtained by the paper, two weeks after the shootings, Myles and Ashton Sachs filed for guardianship of their three younger siblings.

Although the Sachs couple continued cohabiting and working together nearly 15 years after their split, their separation was marked by restraining orders and hostility.

The couple separated in 1999, but continued living and running several businesses together

Following their divorce, which had been characterized by Andra Sachs as a 'financial decision,' according to a friend, the couple adopted a boy and girl from Russia.

Neighbors were shocked by the brutal killings of the seemingly pleasant couple, but their business associates and customers described the Saches as difficult to work with.  

Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names.

In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax evaders, allegedly owing $1.15million to the state.

The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.'

Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother.

In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute.
