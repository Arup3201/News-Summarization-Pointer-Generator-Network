The former fiancee of South Carolina Representative Mark Sandford says she learned of the official end of their relationship in the same way the rest of the world did: on Facebook.

Maria Belen Chapur says Sandford's shock announcement came after the two spent a romantic week together in Paris.

Chapur says that after a tumultuous five-year relationship, she pressed Sanford on the issue of marriage during their 'honeymoon'-like holiday.

Broken engagement: Representative Mark Sanford, with his former fiancee Maria Belen Chapur at his side, addresses supporters in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, on Tuesday, April 2, 2013

‘I had a spectacular week, you know I love you, but I don’t want to continue in the category of mistress, and if we continue like this I continue in that category, and I can’t bear it anymore. It has been really painful to me,' Chapur told The New York Times she explained to Sandford.

She continued, 'His response was, "24 months. If not I’ll say goodbye and I will look for you in 24 months."'

The next Chapur heard of her relationship with Sandford was a 2,346-word public Facebook post.

'I learned it from the press today,' she told The New York Times Saturday.

In a very personal post on his Facebook detailing his latest spat with his former spouse,  Sanford announced that he and his mistress-turned-fiancee, Chapur, a woman he once called his 'soul mate,' had called off their wedding plans.

'No relationship can stand forever this tension of being forced to pick between the one you love and your own son or daughter, and for this reason Belen and I have decided to call off the engagement,' Sanford wrote.

'Maybe there will be another chapter when waters calm with Jenny, but at this point the environment is not conducive to building anything given no one would want to be caught in the middle of what’s now happening,' he said, referring to accusations levied against him in court last month by his ex-wife.

Jenny Sanford suggested in a court motion that her former husband does illegal and prescription drugs and gets drunk in front of their teenage son Blake. She also asked the court to require Sanford to undergo psychological tests and restrict his visits with his son.

Another section of the motion asks the judge to ban both parents from having overnight guests of the opposite sex who could be considered a 'paramour.'

While the court filing submitted by Jenny Sanford's lawyers repeatedly asks the that the judge ban both Sanfords from inappropriate conduct in front of their youngest son, the motion makes clear that it is Mark Sanford's behavior that instigated the legal proceedings.

Addressing the issue on Facebook, Sanford said, 'This really is crazy.'

'I have never taken any illegal drug in my life,' he said. 'I did not drink in high school or college and though I do drink now, my consumption is so limited that my friends give me a hard time about it. I will have but one beer or two when out at a social occasion.'

Sanford also contended that his longtime girlfriend, with whom he began having an extra-marital affair with in 2008, had never spent the night when his two younger sons were staying with him. And Chapur only stayed over two times when his two older sons were under his roof, he said.

'Though Jenny herself has certainly not lived up to this clause it is clearly aimed at me given near everyone knows about Belen and in that regard it seems designed to create intrigue where none exists,' he charged.

Buried in the long Facebook post about his ongoing divorce drama is an announcement that he and Chapur separated as a result of the stress placed on their relationship by his legal battles with his ex-wife.

'Belen is a remarkably wonderful woman who I have always loved and I will be forever grateful for not only the many years we have known and loved each other,' he said, 'but the last six very tough ones wherein she has encouraged me and silently borne its tribulations with her ever warm and kind spirit.'

The Argentina native and Sanford had been engaged since August of 2012. The relationship became the subject of intense media coverage after the still-married Sanford revealed in 2009 that the two were having an affair.

Sanford was serving as South Carolina Governor at the time of the scandal. He got caught with his hands in the cookie jar after claiming that he was hiking in the Appalachian mountains for six days when he was really in Argentina carrying on with his lover.

Jenny Sanford separated from her husband soon after the love affair was reported in the press, and the couple was granted a divorce in 2010.

After spending several years out of the public eye, Sanford, who was once thought to be a contender for the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2012, jumped back into public spotlight when he reclaimed a congressional seat he once held in a May 2013 special election.

In a 2,346 word post on his Facebook page on Friday Sanford claimed that he first heard about his wife's new court filings through the media and that he has 'struggled in how to respond' for the past week and a half.

The Republican lawmaker said he didn't originally intend to respond publicly to his former spouses claims, but he had 'prayed on it, thought on it and asked the advice of friends' and came to the conclusion his constituents deserved an explanation.

'In as much as you sign my paycheck and you have elected me to represent you in Washington, I think I owe you my thinking on this personal, but now public matter,' he said.

Sanford said he had tried to turn the other cheek, as commanded in the Bible, but recently discovered that 'I cannot do this anymore.'

'In all life there comes a point wherein lines must be drawn in the way that we attempt to respond in ways that don’t invite more in the way of conflict and add more in the way of modeling Christ’s humility in giving in every instance.

'I’ll never get that mix right, none of us do,' he said, 'but I believe it’s what we are to pursue in all of our responses to the inevitable reality of conflict in our lives.'

The conservative congressman said that in the past he had not hired lawyers to fight is court battles against his ex wife, including during his divorce, and had instead represented himself or relied on the help of friends in order to save his children - and his pocketbook - from unnecessary pain.

From now on, he said Friday, he'll be allowing a lawyer to handle the situation 'so that I can focus without further distraction on our boys and my work in Washington.'

Even though his ex-wife continues to attack him, Sanford said he would 'never attempt attempt to detract from her or all the positive things she has done in her life.'

'I hope and believe Jenny and I can find a new way,' he said.

'It’s also reminder for every one of you who have been blessed to avoid the agony of divorce, of how important it is you spend time when you have it with those who now bear your name.'
