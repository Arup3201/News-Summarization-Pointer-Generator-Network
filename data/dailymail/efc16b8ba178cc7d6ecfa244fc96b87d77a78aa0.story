Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures Chair Amy Pascal have been further embarrassed by leaked emails released as a result of the Sony hack, this time mocking President Barack Obama in a set of racist email exchanges. 

On the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event in October 2013.

'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery in the antebellum South.

More emails: A new email exchange between Amy Pascal (left) and Scott Rudin (right) that has been leaked has the two mocking the president's race

Bad timing: The emails were exchanged on the eve of a fundraiser attended by President Obama (above) at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg

'12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave, a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in America.

The pair then keep going, listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name, including Lee Daniels' The Butler and two Kevin Hart movies, Think Like a Man and Ride Along.

'I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' says Rudin at one point. 

This all come just one day after Rudin called Angelina Jolie 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in emails discussing who would direct her upcoming remake of the classic film flop Cleopatra. 

Pascal and Sony have refused to comment on the leaked emails, though Rudin did give a statement to the New York Times.

'This is not about salacious emails being batted around by Gawker and Defamer,' the disgraced producer said on Wednesday.

'It’s about a criminal act, and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals.'

Racist response: Rudin suggests that Pascal maybe talk with the President about 12 Years a Slave (above)

Not good: The email exchange also finds Rudin commenting that President Obama 'likes Kevin Hart'

In other leaked emails, these having to do with Rudin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic Jobs, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has some not so kind words for the man now set to star in the film, Michael Fassbender.

'I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care,' Sorkin tells Pascal when informed of the studio's desire to cast the actor, who also starred in 12 Years a Slave. 

Cyber attackers breached Sony's computer network on November 24. 

North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, despite their anger over Sony's planned movie 'The Interview'. 

Hackers released online several upcoming Sony movies including the family hit Annie. 

The personal details of thousands of employees were also released. 

Hackers also revealed the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity. 

Dozens of highly embarrassing emails were released - including one which described Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. 

Another email claimed 'nobody' knows the identity of Hollywood star Michael Fassbender, though one man does praise the size of his genitalia. 

One man who is clearly a fan of Fassbender however is producer Michael De Luca, who says of the Irish actor in one email, 'He just makes you feel bad to have normal-sized genitalia.' 

On a more innocuous note, another email exchange released on Tuesday involving Sony Pictures Television president Steve Mosko revealed that Community star Joel McHale was trying to get a discount on an $8,000 Sony television shortly after his show Community was originally cancelled by the studio after five seasons on the air.

According to a report on BuzzFeed the emails formed part of the November 24 cyber attack on Sony Pictures. 

As for the fundraising event, which took place last November, President Obama did indeed talk about the film industry, saying: 'Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy. 

'If they’re watching an old movie — Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,The Mary Tyler Moore Show, or Will and Grace and Modern Family — they’ve had a front-row seat to our march towards progress. Even if their own nations haven’t made that progress yet.'

According to public records, Pascal donated $5,000 to President Obama's re-election campaign and gave a further $30,800 to the Democtratic National Committee. 

Obama made no mention of the films Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave, Lee Daniels' The Butler, Think Like a Man or Ride Along in his speech at the event. 

Clint Culpepper, pictured, described Kevin Hart as a 'whore' after the star wanted more money

Actor Kevin Hart, was branded 'a whore' by a senior Sony Executive after the star asked for more money to promote a new movie.. 

The email exchange between Sony studio executive Clint Culpepper and Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and Sony Entertainment chief executive officer Michael Lynton, was leaked following a major cyber attack on the company. 

According to Gawker: 'I'm not saying he's a whore, but he's a whore.'

The email continued: 'It's not as if we paid him 3M and 4M respectively for his last 2 films thinking he might be nominated. We paid for his ability to open a film which included his social media savvy. 

'I feel like this is something that should be negotiated going into the film as opposed to after the fact. It feels tantamount to buying a car and then upon picking it up being told that the engine will cost extra. I'm tempted to suggest we call his bluff. 

'If he doesn't do his normal routine, his film will not open as well and his brand will appear diminished and he will- in fact - be f****** himself because we have his next 2 immediate films. And then there's the social media precedent we're setting...especially in light of the fact that Channing is at the same agency.'
