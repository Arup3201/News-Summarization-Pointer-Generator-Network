It has been revealed that one of the four victims of the Kosher supermarket killings in Paris, Yoav Hattab, was the son of the Chief Rabbi of Tunis and director of the Jewish School, Benjamin Hattab.

The 21-year-old, from La Goulette, a coastal town in the suburbs of Tunis had moved to Paris to study marketing and international trade.

Yohan Cohen, 22, Philippe Braham, in his forties, and François-Michel Saada, thought to be in his sixties, were also murdered in the attack, French Jewish organisation Crif confirmed.

It emerged today that Mr Hattab passed his baccalaureate at the Tunis French lycee, and augmented his studies working as a small business sales manager.

Living near Vincennes his family knew he always visited the Kosher deli for the Sabbath but had hoped he had escaped the carnage.

So far Tunisian authorities have remained silent on the murder.

Yamina Thabet, president of the Tunisian Association representing minorities, denounced the ‘incredible silence of Tunisian authorities.’

‘Apart from the Islamist movement Ennahda who presented their condolences, no politician has yet commented on the death of the Tunisian citizen.’

All four men were murdered on Friday by Islamic terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, including one who is said to have snatched one of the extremist's guns and turned it on the hostage taker - only to find that the weapon had jammed.

The dramatic account was revealed by a survivor who fled the shoot-out as armed police officers and soldiers raided the store yesterday.

Mickael B, as he wishes to be known, was held in the store with his three-year-old son when the fellow hostage suddenly grabbed the weapon which had been left on the counter and tried to fire it at terrorist Amedy Coulibaly.

But, after discovering the gun had been left there because it was malfunctioning, the extremist shot and killed the heroic hostage.

Giving a terrifying account, Mickael said: 'I was heading for the check-out with the goods in my hand when I heard a bang – very loud. I thought it was a firecracker at first. But turning I saw a black man armed with two Kalashnikov rifles and I knew what was happening.'

'I grabbed my son by the collar and fled to the back of the store. There, with other customers, we ran down a spiral staircase into the basement. We all piled into one of two cold rooms – our door wouldn't close. We were terrified.

'Five minutes later a store employee was sent down by the killer. She said he said we were to go back up otherwise there'd be carnage. I refused to go up.

'By now my son, understanding nothing, was panicking. Then minutes later the employee comes back down with the same message. This time I decided to follow her up the spiral staircase.

'At the top a man was dying in a pool of his own blood. The terrorist introduced himself to us. He was strangely calm. 'I am Amedi Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State,' he told us.'

'Then he told us to put our phones on the ground. He walked around the store, armed, totally justifying himself, speaking of Palestine, French prisons, his brothers in Syria and many other things.

'Suddenly one of the customers tried to grab one of his guns which he'd left on the counter. It wasn't working. The terrorist had put it there because it had blocked after the first shots,' Mickael told Le Point.

'He turned and shot at the customer who died on the spot.'

Mickael added: 'He then demanded that I call the media, which I did. From then on the phone in the store never stopped ringing. It was mainly journalists. 

'I told them now was not the time. My son started to cry he wanted to go home. He said the terrorist was a bad man.

'I managed to get my phone out discreetly and got in touch with the police outside while the terrorist was roaming the aisles.

'A policeman told me that we should be ready to throw ourselves flat on the ground when the assault came, which would be soon.

'It was obvious that the terrorist was preparing to die. He said it was his reward. He had a weapon in each hand and boxes of cartridges nearby. He suddenly began to pray.

'My mobile was still on. The police had heard it all. Minutes later the shop grille was lifted. We knew it was the start of the assault.

'We flung ourselves to the ground. The noise was deafening. He was dead. It was over.' 

A young Malian Muslim who was working in the supermarket when it was raided has hailed as a 'hero' after it was revealed that he led Jewish customers away from the terrorist to safety in the kosher store.

Lassana Bathily, 24, helped up to 15 people to take shelter in the store's walk in freezer.

French police named the hostage taker as Amedy Coulibaly (right). Police also named Hayat Boumeddiene (left) as helping him. However, it is no longer clear whether she was involved amid reports she is in Syria

'I opened the door and told a number of people to get in there. I turned off the light, turned off the freezer and closed the door,' he said.

'I told them, stay calm I am going out.'

Using a goods lift he escaped and was able to give the police valuable information about what was happening inside and where the hostages were hiding.

Shy and reluctant to tell his story he admitted that after the shoot-out many of the customers came to shake his hand and thank him for what he did.

Today his picture – labelled Malian Muslim – has been tweeted around the world as a symbol of the good of people united against terrorism.

Questions were asked today of how the Charlie Hebdo shooters had been able to carry out the attacks. Both the Kouachi brothers are understood to have been on British and American terror watch lists. 

Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment police stormed in to the Paris kosher supermarket last night before terrorist Amedy Coulibaly was shot dead.

Commandos launched flash grenades into the grocery and fired into the shop before a man believed to be the hostage taker was gunned down. Moments later, terrified captives could be seen running to safety.

It comes as it was revealed that the Isis fanatic had slaughtered four hostages before officers launched the raid.

Last night, chilling images emerged of bodies lying on the floor of the bullet-ridden shop after several shoppers were taken hostage inside the grocery store - including women and children. Further images emerged of Coulibaly's bloodied body lying on a pavement after the siege had come to a dramatic end.

It has also been revealed there were 500 calls made between the phone belonging to Coulibaly's wife Hayat Boumeddiene and a phone belonging to one of the wives of the Kouachi brothers.

Boumeddiene, France's most wanted woman, is now in Syria after crossing the Turkish border earlier this month.
