A rogue nation could use climate change as an excuse to carry out potentially disastrous experiments with geoengineering, experts warn.

A country threatened by rising sea levels or even a wealthy individual could use their resources to tamper with the atmosphere in a bid to cool the planet, with uncertain consequences.

The nightmare possibility, which could set off a disastrous chain reaction in the Earth's climate systems, is one possible 'X Factor' considered in a report on global risks by the World Economic Forum.

the stratosphere to release dust to block light from the Sun

'The global climate could, in effect, be hijacked by a rogue country or even a wealthy individual, with unpredictable costs to agriculture, infrastructure and global stability,' the report warns.

Scientists worried about climate change are exploring ways in which they could artificial manipulate the Earth's climate in an attempt to mitigate some of its worst effects.

Many different processes have been mooted for such geoengineering, but the most common suggestion is for 'solar radiation management' in which particles of sulphur could be injected into the stratosphere to block solar energy.

In the past, volcanic eruptions have achieved the same effect, and scientists have claimed such solar management would take effect quickly and be cheap to implement.

Recent studies have suggested that a small fleet of aircraft could inject a million tons of sulphur compounds into the stratosphere - enough to offset half the global warming recorded to date - for just $1-2billion a year.

'In theory, the technology would be tantamount to a planetary thermostat, giving humans direct control over global temperature,' said the WEF report.

'The direct impact of dimming the sun would be felt within weeks to months.'

But the potential side effects of such
 large-scale interference with our planet's climate systems are unknown -
 and could be disastrous.

'The
 problem is that incoming solar radiation drives the entire climate 
system, so reducing sunlight would fundamentally alter the way energy 
and water moves around the planet,' the report said.

'Almost
 any change in weather and climate patterns is likely to create winners 
and losers, but determining causation and quantifying impacts on any 
given region or country would be a massive challenge.'

The warning came in a special section of the WEF's Global Risks report published on Tuesday which focuses on 'X Factors' - emerging concerns of possible future importance and with unknown consequences.

In collaboration with the respected scientific journal Nature, the report's writers present five possible high risk scenarios which could sneak up on an unsuspecting world with little warning.

In addition to the threat posed by rogue geoengineers, other X Factors identified in the report include:

Last month a scientist claimed that not only could we use geoengineering to refreeze the Arctic, but that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation.

The possibility that a nation or individual could unilaterally tamper with the globe's climate may seem like the plot of a Hollywood spy thriller but, as the World Economic Forum report notes, it has already happened.

In July last year, California businessman Russ George attempted to capture carbon from the air by dumping 100 tons of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean to spawn an artificial plankton bloom.

He succeeded in producing a bloom as large as 10,000 sq/km which he hoped would absorb carbon dioxide from the air then sink to the sea bed, allowing him to cash in on lucrative carbon credits. 

However, his actions may have been in violation of two international agreements. Lab tests have shown that such plankton blooms can pump out neurotoxins, disrupt food chains and alter ecosystems in unexpected ways.

Worse still, they can even expedite ocean acidification, which would actually accelerate global warming.

David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice.

'The really hard questions here aren’t mostly technical. They’re questions about what kind of planet we want and who we are,' he told Canadian newspaper The Windsor Star.

Professor Keith used climate models to suggest that injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic.

His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels.

'Decisions involving (solar radiation management) do not need to be reduced to a single "global thermostat",' the paper says.

His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year.

However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest.

Open-air and large-scale geoengineering of the kind Professor Keith has suggested has been ruled out by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.

Such drastic geoengineering could have disastrous unintended effects but could be a viable response to a 'climate emergency' such as the sudden collapse of ice sheets or a killing drought, Professor Keith suggested.
