A man who inhumanely slaughtered a pig in his front yard before butchering it has been convicted of animal cruelty charges.

A shocked RSPCA officer found former boxer Ricky Clarkson, 48, cutting up the animal on a table in the front yard of his house in May this year after being called to the property by a neighbour.

He initially said he had killed the pig by hammering a nail through its head before later changing his story and telling a court he had slit its throat.

Butchered: After catching Ricky Clarkson butchering the pig in his front yard, RSPCA officers found parcels of pork chops in his freezer when they returned with a warrant to search his property

When RSPCA officers returned 10 days later with a search warrant, they found 
parcels of pig meat stored in a freezer, the remnants of a carcass in a 
recycling bin and several knives in a shed.

Mr Clarkson, of Bradmore Way, Coulsdon, south London, then denied having killed the pig with a nail and said he had 'slit its throat, Halal-style', Bromley Magistrates Court heard.

He said he was unaware of laws stipulating that pigs should be shot with a stun gun prior to being killed.

Andrew Wiles, prosecuting, said: 'You are allowed to home-slaughter if you follow the regulations. You did not do that. You are coming up with your story today now you know what those regulations are.'

Mr Clarkson, defending himself, said he had used a captive bolt gun to stun the pig before killing it but had lied to officers because he feared prosecution for possessing the gun.

He said: 'I kill animals law-abidingly and honestly.'

He said he planned to eat the pig and had also shot kangaroos in the past.

Saved from the chop: The RSCPA rescued this pig from Mr Clarkson's house after he was banned from keeping animals for a year

He denied causing unnecessary suffering to an animal by killing it in an inhumane manner, failing to prevent suffering to an animal that was his responsibility and killing a pig without prior stunning.

But magistrates found him guilty of all three charges and banned him from owning pigs, sheep or chickens for a year.

He was also fined £150 and ordered to pay £1,000 costs.
