Monaco are keeping in close contact with Arsene Wenger and the French club are still keen to tempt him away from Arsenal.

Club officials met Wenger two months ago when they travelled to London to take part in the Emirates Cup. 

The Arsenal manager made his name at Monaco between 1987 and 1994, winning the French League in his first season. Monaco considered offering him a £10million-per-year tax-free deal, with his contract at Arsenal due to expire, but Wenger eventually signed a three-year extension with the Gunners worth £24m.

Vice President Vadim Vasilyev said: 'For Monaco he is part of our history, part of our heritage.

'He is doing an amazing job. I don't know if one day he will want to come back, but we keep a very good relationship. Last time we exchanged was during the Emirates Cup. He keeps a strong affection for Monaco.'

Vasilyev added: 'Our ambition is to be one of the clubs that plays regularly in the Champions League.'

Meanwhile, Wenger has revealed that Mesut Ozil heard a crack in his ruptured left knee before half-time in Arsenal's 2-0 loss at Chelsea at the start of the month.

In an exclusive interview with beIN Sports, Wenger said: 'He felt a crack. I am deeply shocked. He wasn't involved in a collision.'
