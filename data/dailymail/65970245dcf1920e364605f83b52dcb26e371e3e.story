Former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith yesterday became the latest public figure to be accused of sexually abusing children.

Sir Cyril, who tipped the scales at up to 29 stone, inflicted humiliating punishments on boys at a hostel in the early 1960s, the House of Commons was told.

The claims were later investigated by police but no case was brought against Sir Cyril, who died two years ago  aged 82.

Yesterday, however, as two former residents of the hostel spoke out for the first time about the alleged abuse, his successor as Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk publicly accused him.

Sir Cyril’s appearance on one of Jimmy Savile’s BBC television shows in the early 1970s may now form part of a review of claims of abuse on the corporation’s premises.

Labour’s Mr Danczuk told the Commons during a debate that Sir Cyril, a high-profile political figure for decades, used to summon boys from the town’s Cambridge House hostel and slap their naked bottoms.

‘Young boys were humiliated, terrified and reduced to quivering wrecks by a 29st bully imposing himself on them,’ he said.

Larger than life: Sir Cyril Smith died in 2010

He had seen statements given to Lancashire Police in the late 1960s, which made ‘grim reading’.

‘For some unknown reason, Cyril Smith had a kind of disciplinarian role at the hostel and was given free rein to administer punishment to the boys,’ he added.

He said one of the boys told police: ‘He told me to take my trousers and pants down and bend over his knee. He hit me many times with his bare hands and I pleaded with him to stop because he was hurting me.’

Mr Danczuk said he believed the file had been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time, but no action was taken, and called for a new police investigation.

Linking the claims with the scandal of sexual abuse of girls by Asian gangs in his constituency, he said: ‘Attempts to suppress the truth are not new in Rochdale.

‘The culture of cover-up stretches back much further than the recent grooming scandal, and extends right to the heart of our political establishment.’

Claims about Sir Cyril – who was elected to Parliament in 1972 and represented Rochdale for 20 years – first surfaced publicly in 1979 in a local magazine. He threatened legal action but later backed down.

As a local councillor, Sir Cyril had played a key role in setting up Cambridge House – a hostel for working boys – in 1962 and allegedly had keys to the building.

One ex-resident, Barry Fitton, who was 15 at the time, said that as well as intrusive ‘medical examinations’ he had been forced to strip and have his buttocks slapped.

‘He was big and he was heavy,’ he told the PoliticsHome.com website. ‘Imagine how that would feel slapping you around.’

Another, Eddie Shorrock, who was 17 at the time, claimed Sir Cyril used to force him to strip for ‘medical examinations’ if he called in sick.

He claimed Sir Cyril – then in his 30s – would tell him to ‘drop your underpants and spin round, twirl round’. A third ex-resident has contacted solicitors representing alleged victims of Jimmy Savile.  But Sir Cyril’s brother Norman, now 80, hit out at Mr Danczuk’s claims. ‘I think it’s disgusting that he’s making accusations like this against someone who’s no longer here to defend himself,’ he said. ‘

Sir Cyril was a guest on an edition of Jimmy Savile’s show Clunk Click broadcast in 1973 when the MP sang She’s a Lassie from Lancashire.

A BBC spokesman said ‘any relevant information’ would be passed to Dame Janet Smith’s inquiry into culture and practices at the corporation.
