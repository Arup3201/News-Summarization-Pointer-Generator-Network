An unidentified body exhumed in Alabama is not the man accused of using a sledgehammer to kill his family in Maryland in 1976, the FBI said Wednesday.

The FBI had said photos of the unidentified hitchhiker who was killed in a hit-and-run looked like William Bradford 'Brad' Bishop Jr., but using DNA, agency scientists determined it was not him, spokeswoman Amy Thoreson said in an email.

Bishop was accused of killing his wife, mother and three sons in their Bethesda, Maryland, home in 1976. Authorities later found the bodies burned in North Carolina and Bishop's station wagon in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park south of Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

Last year, a Scottsboro, Alabama, police officer began a campaign to publicize the hit-and-run cold case, resulting in a story in the local newspaper. The FBI also renewed its investigation into the disappearance of Bishop. He was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List in April and his case was featured on the CNN program 'The Hunt with John Walsh.'

Scottsboro resident Jeremy Collins saw the program and noticed similarities between Bishop's picture and the hitchhiker's photo. He called police and the body was exhumed.

Thoreson said she did not know if the FBI had identified the body.  

The John Doe was killed when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver while walking on a highway in Scottsboro, Alabama, in October 1981. 

The FBI added Bishop to its 10 Most Wanted list in April. Since Bishop was added to the 10 Most Wanted list, the FBI has received about 350 tips, Thoreson said.

The last confirmed sighting of Bishop was at a sporting goods store in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the day after his family was killed. Two weeks later, his station wagon was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, just over 200 miles from Scottsboro.

Given the size of the park, which encompasses more than 500,000 acres, Bishop, an avid outdoorsman, 'could have remained in the North Carolina/Alabama/Tennessee area for many years without being discovered,' FBI agent Pamela Hanson wrote in an affidavit.

It is believed he was overlooked for promotion in the months leading up to the brutal killings and had been seeking treatment for depression.

Evading capture: A spokesman for the FBI said Bishop was an avid outdoorsman, and could have travelled in North Carolina, Alabama or North Carolina for years without detection 

Weapon: Bradford, who was said to have been overlooked for a promotion before the deaths, allegedly killed his wife and three sons with this sledgehammer
