Apple is developing a 'smart' iPad cover that can show emails and other notifications even when the iPad is switched off.

Patents reveal the new cover could include low power LEDs and other screen technologies to avoid draining the battery.

Another design also shows transparent sections int he case, allowing the display to be seen.

The case would have low power displays built in, allowing basic messages or icons to be displayed without draining the battery of the iPad too much.

The cover will show users notifications via shapes, symbols or words, rather than a battery draining full screen.

Depending on the priority of the alert, the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover.

For example, if an incoming email is marked 'important,' a letter-shaped icon may illuminate on a segment near the top of the cover, while a less urgent text message can be displayed near the bottom of the tablet.

Apple says the existing volume buttons would be used to scroll through or dismiss alerts.

'The idea is novel and would be useful to iPad owners who always hand-carry their tablet, though the feature would be a drain on battery life,' the site says,.

'Like all Apple patents, it is unknown when such an accessory will hit the market, if at all.'

The patents were uncovered by AppleInsider.

The patents shows different methods of creating a display.

Both the active and passive cover types are designed to transmit notifications to the user via shapes, symbols or words, rather than a battery draining full screen.

Depending on the priority of the alert, the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover.

For example, if an incoming email is marked 'important,' a letter-shaped icon may illuminate on a segment near the top of the cover, while a less urgent text message can be displayed near the bottom of the tablet.

Apple says the existing volume buttons would be used to scroll through or dismiss alerts.

The patent outlines several ways to show alerts. Depending on the priority of the alerts, the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover.

The cover could be revealed in September, when Apple is expected to introduce new iPads.

According to reports from Korea, suppliers are gearing up to begin production of the next-generation iPad Air - dubbed iPad Air 2 - later this month.

It is expected to feature the 8MP camera seen on the iPhone 5S, a faster processor and, most notably, it could sport Apple's fingerprint scanner to unlock the device.

Along with the improved security features promised on iOS 8, this could make the iPad Air 2 the most secure tablet ever.

The original iPad Air was launched on Friday 1 November 2013 (stock image shown). Given Apple's preference for launching products on a Friday, a release date for the upgraded iPad Air 2 of 31 October 2014 seems possible, with the company apparently gearing up for a release in Q3 or Q4 this year

In addition to the rumoured fingerprint scanner, Apple's iOS 8 could also help boost the security of its next-generation devices.

For example, when connecting to a Wi-Fi network, the software won't reveal your device's MAC address.

This is used to identify the device, and can be used to determine who owns it.

Apple is also increasing privacy and payment controls in the app store.

The tech giant is additionally paying closer attention to the types of apps it approves on its store to avoid developers spamming customers, or showing excessive advertising.

According to MacRumors, production of the displays for the next-generation tablet has begun.

This will gear it up for release in the autumn, expected to be a Friday towards the end of October, bringing it in line with previous releases.

The original iPad Air, for example, launched on Friday 1 November 2013 - perhaps suggest 31 October 2014 could be a favoured date for the latest release, given Apple’s preference of launching products on a Friday.

The iPad Air 2 is rumoured to have the same screen size as its predecessor, which sported a 9.7-inch (24.6 centimetres) retina LCD display that had a resolution of 2048 x 1536.

It could also have a similar thickness, of 0.3 inches (7.5mm) and a similar weight of around 16.6 oz (470g).

It’s thought the camera will be upgraded from the 5MP version seen on the current iPad Air to the same 8MP camera used on the iPhone 5S.

This could also include the iSight technology that makes low-light shots easier to take, and allows for slow-motion video to be filmed.

California-based Apple Inc (stock image shown) is gearing up to release the latest version of its iPad Air later this year. Rumours suggest the Air 2 will have an faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor. The overall size of the tablet, however, is likely to remain nearly the same

Inside the device, the tablet is expected to sport a new and improved processor in the form of the A8, with Among Tech reporting this will have 50 per cent more performance than the previous A7.

And finally, it is almost certain the Air 2 will use the same Touch ID fingerprint sensor to unlock the device.

This was introduced on the iPhone 5S and is expected to also be used on the iPhone 6.

A new iPad Mini is also expected to be released at the same time as Apple's other flagship models. 

'Apple
sees its Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the future of digital security, and
with iOS 8 on the horizon, Apple is opening up that technology to app developers,' Stephen Ashby from iCreate Magazine tells MailOnline.

'The iPad Air 2 will not only be more secure, but it will also make it easier
for users to sign into online accounts or buy things safely and quickly.

'It’s
unlikely that Apple will change its winning formula too much, though.

Apple's iPhone 5S (pictured) was the first phone from the tech giant to use the new Touch ID fingerprint technology. This is able to recognise the fingerprint of the user and, when a digit is pressed against the home button at the bottom, it allows the phone to be unlocked without entering a code

'Aside
from the rumoured Touch ID scanner, improvements to the camera and faster
processor, Apple is unlikely to make other changes to the hardware.

'Expect a
very similar design to the first iPad Air, with a few upgrades and perhaps
another colour option.'

In other Apple news, yet more pictures of Apple's iPhone 6 were revealed yesterday showing the handset side-by-side with the current iPhone.

The leak came from former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases.

They
 appear to confirm the handset will has a larger 4.7-inch screen, and 
that Apple has moved the power button to allow the handset to be 
operated easily with one hand.

According to Lin, the iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch (11.9cm) display, more rounded than the previous models.

He described the device as being 'very grippy' in the hand.

The
 device also has a headphone socket - despite recent rumours Apple could
 abandon a dedicated socket and instead use the lightning connector 
currently used for charging.

The leaks are the latest to hit Apple, all showing an identical, slimline design.

However, Apple has not commented on the pictures.
