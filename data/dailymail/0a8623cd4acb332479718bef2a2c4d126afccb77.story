It did not look as if he had any birthday cake when he celebrated turning 28 on Tuesday, such is the shape he is in.

Khan also trained in the ring at the Roy Jones Jnr gym and appeared in good spirits.

With the winner of this week's fight possibly taking on Floyd Mayweather next year, Khan declared he is the future of boxing and hopes he is given the chance to take on the unbeaten five-weight world champion.

'I’m focused on Alexander,’ said Khan. ‘But after I beat him I hope the people will say that I deserve to fight Floyd and will demand that he meets me.’

‘I have the fastest hands in the ring. I have some of the best skills in boxing.

'I deserve to be regarded as among the elite fighters in the world, to be talked about in the same breath as Mayweather and Pacquiao. I believe I am the future of boxing.’
