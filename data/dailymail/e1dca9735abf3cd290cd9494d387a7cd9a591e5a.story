Dip-dye - or 'ombre' - hair, as championed by Cheryl Cole and Kylie Jenner, may have been the hottest hairstyle of last season but the trend is migrating its way down to the eyelashes.

The hottest new beauty trend, set to dominate the festival scene, is two-toned eyelashes.

Whether it's natural black with purple or a more daring half-pink, half lime-green look, one beauty salon is seeing a surge in customers.

New beauty trend? While last season was all about dip-dye or 'ombre' hair, this season will see the beauty trend move to the eyelashes

Eyelash extension experts Perfect Eyelashes offer ombre lashes made from a silk fibre with coloured tips, that have been pre-dyed at the ends.

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'Black lash extensions have become very popular since stars such as Kim Kardashian admitted to wearing them.

'Since then, the popularity has boomed, and our sales have increased drastically, but we've taken it a step further.

'The ombre lash is ahead of the trend and we think it’s perfect for the festival season. The lashes look amazing when they catch the light, and the true colour of the tips shows.

'We decided to go for blue, purple and green as these colours complement each eye colour perfectly.

'Each client can choose a totally bespoke set of ombre or classic lashes to suit their needs.  We have a long list of celebrity fans, including Lucy Watson, Lily Allen, Amy Willerton and Lauren Goodger, who are now loyal customers, and love to try out our newest lashes.'

It all started with the hair! Cheryl Cole, left, and Kylie Jenner, right, are huge fans of the ombre hair look, which has now migrated to eyelashes...will they be trialling the new trend?

Being ahead of the trend doesn't come cheap - the ombre lashes cost £100 and the application takes 1.5-2 hours.

Speaking about the new trend, celebrity make-up artist Mikey Philips, who works with Gemma Collins and Amy Childs, said: 'Ombre eyelashes are fun and flirty and perfect for the festival season.

'Ombre lashes are hot and a great way of adding a pop of colour without the need for eye shadow.

'They are the perfect way to add colour and fun to any look. Make sure you choose a shade that works against your eye colour to maximise the drama.'
