A former CNN employee who enjoyed wearing brightly colored clothes to work and also mariachi uniforms has launched a $60 million discrimination lawsuit after he fired last June.

William Kane claims that he was let go from the news station's New York operation after his sexuality became common knowledge.

According to his lawsuit, Kane's claims that although he had always dressed in a colorful manner it only became a problem once bosses heard about his same-sex engagement.

William Kane, pictured alongside Christine Amanpour, claims he had always worn bright colors to work and that it only became an issue after he revealed his same-sex engagement and so his boss learned of his sexuality

Kane worked at CNN for over 10 years and claims for the majority of that time no one ever complained about his wardrobe which included a hot pink shirt, bright red track jacket, neon green soccer jersey and a yellow track suit with matching shoes and hat.

The lawsuit states that after Kane's supervisor John Silva learned that he was gay, his workplace environment became hostile, reports the New York Daily News.

He alleges that Silva told him he didn't want him to wear either his black or yellow mariachi suits 'because it was too flamboyant for a male in our department.'

Silva runs the technical operations department and suggested to Kane that he might be better suited in the 'entertainment or make-up department.'

In his lawsuit, Kane claims he was told that presenters including Erin Burnett, center, and Pier Morgan, right, had complained about his clothes, but when he was spoke to them they denied having a problem

Kane claims he was singled out, despite the fact that the department had had a tradition of wearing colorful shirts on Thursdays between 2002 and 2008.

During Kane's CNN career he worked alongside presenters including Christine Amanpour, Piers Morgan and Erin Burnett.

In his lawsuit he claims that a supervisor offered him $100 to buy something from TJ Maxx after former presenter Piers Morgan had complained that Kane's blue track suit was too distracting.

Kane refused the money and put a black CNN sweatshirt over the track suit. When he later confronted Morgan about the issue, the British journalist denied that it had been an issue.

Another time Kane claims he was ordered to change out of a white suit and red tie because Erin Burnett considered it 'too flashy'. She denied to his face making any such comment.

Kane said he complained to the human resources department about his treatment, but then he was cited for nitpicking violations.
