From the inside: Luke Anderson tweeted about his holiday lifestyle inside HMP Haverigg, telling followers he also had Facebook, Whatsapp and BBM on his phone

A prisoner could get his sentence increased after boasting on Twitter that 'jail is easy' at the 'Costa del Haverigg'.

Luke Anderson is serving time at HMP Haverigg, one of the country’s most isolated jails.

But the convict managed to get hold of a mobile phone - before posting a slew of tweets about his 'holiday' behind bars.

He contacted friends, telling them: 'i'm on twitter facebook watsapp and bbm [talk] to me #jails easy'.

Despite vowing never to return to jail again once he is released, Anderson described his life as being on 'Costa del Haverigg'.

He added: 'Yeah man got the beach there as well... ha.'

Joking with a friend over the social media site, he revealed he also gets to listen to the radio.

His friend who asked him: 'How are you on Twitter in jail' before adding: 'I’m going to write a letter of complaint to HMP Haverigg for this, it’s terrible!'.

Anderson’s account, which was captioned 'Life goes on :)' has now been closed by officials.

Under procedure, prison staff will now search his cell and he now risks further jail time being added to his sentence.

The scandal at the prison is the latest in a string of embarrassing discoveries which include another seven inmates who posed for pictures in their jail cells along.

Dozens of other inmates have been caught using Facebook and Twitter.

Last year, staff
 at the prison seized 42 mobile phones from inmates in 2013, along 
with around seven sim cards.

Series: It is the latest in a number of cases at the Cumbria jail of officers seizing phones from prisoners

Under UK law it is an offence for prisoners to have a mobile phone or sim card while in jail.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'The justice secretary has made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf.

'No prisoner should be in any doubt that if they break the rules they will be stripped of their privileges and may be reported to the police for further action.'
