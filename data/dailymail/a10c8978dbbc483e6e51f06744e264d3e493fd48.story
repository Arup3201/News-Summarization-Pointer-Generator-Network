Unless your name is Rebecca Adlington, Victoria Pendleton or Mo Farah, sport is probably nothing more than an enjoyable hobby.

Now a new study has revealed that your choice of sport says more about you than you could possibly have imagined.

According researchers, cyclists are more likely to be emotionally stable, runners the most extrovert and swimmers the happiest, while walkers are the least materialistic.

Happiest: Swimmers such as Rebecca Adlington are happier - and tidier - than most 

Best for romance: According to the research, swimmers make the best lovers

The psychological study, which was carried out by experts Mindlab, also revealed that sport can also offer clues to a person's attitude to charity, reading habits and even their voting intentions.

Cyclists, for instance, are most likely to vote Liberal Democrat and tend to be laid back and calm, if keen on acquiring material possessions.

Meanwhile runners tend to be Labour-voting extroverts who love being the centre of attention and have a penchant for upbeat dance music. 

Those who swim tend to make the best lovers, are tidy and are also the most charitable, although according to Mindlab, 61 per cent of adults are fond of charity regardless of their choice of sport.

Walkers, a category that includes those who enjoy rambling, orienteering and trekking, are least concerned about material possessions and like their own company.

'It has long been known that exercise is not only good for your body, but also your mind,' comments neuropsychologist, Dr David Lewis.

The research claims cyclists love shopping and vote Liberal Democrat

'Past research has shown that exercising can act as a mood-enhancer, can be used to treat and possibly even prevent anxiety and generally has a positive effect on mental health. 

'The results from this study show that no matter what kind of person you are, there is the right kind of exercise for everyone.'

The study, which was commissioned by the British Heart Foundation to mark the launch of its 2015 series of events, also found that favourite sports vary by area.

Thus in Birmingham and London, cycling is the sport of choice for most while running wins the race in Leeds and Newcastle. 

Swimming was most popular in Cardiff, Dublin and Manchester, while walking was most loved in Bristol, Glasgow, Norwich and Nottingham.

Supporters: Pippa Middleton (left) and heptathlete Louise Hazel (right) are high profile BHF supporters

The British Heart Foundation is famous for its sporty fundraisers and will once again stage the London to Brighton bike race this June.

Pippa Middleton, one of the charity's best-known supporters, is set to take part, as will Olympic heptathlete Louise Hazel. 

'Whatever your sports personality or level of fitness, I would encourage everyone to sign up to a BHF event,' said Hazel.

'Heart disease devastates too many lives, killing around 80,000 people every year. I lost my father to heart disease, he was just 50 years old. This is why I’m taking on a cycling challenge for BHF.

'Taking on a challenge can help you to get fit, enjoy the sport you love and also help to raise funds for vital research which could help save more people like my dad.'
