Trainer Jonjo O’Neill says his only chance of landing the trainers’ championship means hitting every target with his precious ammunition, starting with Johns Spirit in Saturday’s Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham.

With 56 winners, O’Neill leads the title race by £50,000 from Philip Hobbs but the engines are being stoked by powerhouses Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls and O’Neill concedes holding top slot will be tough.

O’Neill, 52, a dual champion jockey, said: ‘We have got about half a dozen good horses but it is the back-up which is a problem. Last Saturday, we had two runners and Paul Nicholls had five winners. That’s the difference.

‘We need to hit every target with the good horses and it is not easy to do. We are also hoping some of the young horses will shape up like More Of That last did last season.

‘I’d love to win the title. There is no point being in the game if you are not ambitious.’

O’Neill plans to return his 2014 World Hurdle winner More Of That to action in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury’s Hennessy fixture.

Established stars Taquin De Seuil, who goes for the Betfair Chase at Haydock on November 22, and Holywell, due to run at Aintree two weeks later, could now be joined on the Cheltenham Gold Cup trail by Irish National winner Shutthefrontdoor after his impressive comeback at Carlisle on Monday,

O’Neill said: ‘We are looking at running in the Lexus Chase (at Leopardstown on December 28). That should tell us which way to go. If he does well, you would have to look at the Gold Cup.’

O’Neill, currently deprived of sidelined stable jockey AP McCoy, plans a dual assault on the Paddy Power Gold Cup, a race he won in 2006 with Exotic Dancer, with Eastlake joining Johns Spirit, the 2013 winner attempting to become the sixth horse to win the race twice.

The mount of Richie McLernon is a 10-1 shot with the sponsors after his comeback course win last month.

O’Neill said: ‘He is more settled this year and has grown up a lot. I was surprised how well he won last time.

‘Whether the race was not very good or he has improved we will see at the weekend. It is a tough call in fairness. He is 17lb higher than last year but he is young and in his prime.’

Mark Walsh has been lined up to ride Champion Hurdler Jezki in his comeback clash with Hurricane Fly in the Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown on Sunday should Barry Geraghty have commitments at Cheltenham.

Gary Moore’s Champion Chaser Sire De Grugy heads the 10 entries for the Shloer Chase run at Cheltenham the same day.
