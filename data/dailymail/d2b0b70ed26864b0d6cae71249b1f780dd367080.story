President Barack Obama has touched down in Cardiff ahead of tomorrow's Nato summit as world leaders prepare to tell Russia to retreat from Ukraine's borders.

The US leader made clear the alliance stood ready to defend the territorial integrity of 'every single one' of its 28 member states at the two-day conference - a sentiment supported by David Cameron.

And Vladimir Putin showed signs he was feeling the pressure, issuing a call to the pro-Russian separatists to 'stop advancing' while 
urging the Ukrainian army to withdraw its troops from the region.

However
 his words are unlikely to satisfy Western leaders who have threatened 
to tighten the economic sanctions against Russia unless it withdraws its
 support for the insurgents and ends its attempts to destabilise the 
government in Kiev.

The heads of government, foreign ministers and defence ministers will initiate discussions with a working dinner tomorrow on the HMS Duncan, a £1 billion ship.

The sixth-in-class of the Royal Navy's 
state-of-the-art Type 45 destroyers made it through a very tight gap in 
the Welsh capital yesterday as diplomats flew in.

Destroyer HMS Duncan yesterday joined the M-05 Viesturs ship from Latvia, a minehunter, which was already docked at the site.

They
 are set to be joined by the Dutch minesweeper HNLMS Urk, and a missile 
patrol boat in camouflage colours called HNoMS Skudd from Norway.

Also
 there will be the German-built minesweeper LNS Kursis from Lithuania 
and the latest French anti-submarine destroyer La Motte Picquet.

In addition, the Royal Navy's HMS Biter patrol boat and HMS Express fast patrol boat will be part of the contingent.

In response to the Ukraine crisis, the
 U.S. has vowed to contribute troops and equipment to a rapid response 
force in Eastern Europe that would be able to deploy within 48 hours.

Nato has already stepped up its air, land and sea rotations in the region.

And
 Obama announced last night that he would send more Air Force units and 
aircraft to the Baltics, likely to Estonia's Amari Air Base.

The
 alliance is also planning to establish forward operating bases in 
eastern Europe where fuel, ammunition and other supplies can by 
stockpiled ready for use in operations.

With
 Britain and the US two of only four member states to meet the 
alliance's obligation to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence, Mr Cameron 
and Mr Obama will be pressing other leaders to raise their spending on 
their armed forces.

The US president had some harsh words for European members who had failed to deliver on their commitments in the past.

'For
 I think a certain period of time there was a complacency here in Europe
 about the demands that were required to make sure that Nato was able to
 function effectively,' he said.

'Obviously
 what's happened in Ukraine is tragic, but I do think it gives us an 
opportunity to look with fresh eyes and understand what it is that's 
necessary to make sure that our Nato commitments are met.'

Mr
 Cameron and Mr Obama will hold talks tomorrow with president Poroshenko
 - together with Mr Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel and 
Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi - ahead of the main summit meeting.

'The
 alliance must demonstrate clearly that Russia's actions are 
unacceptable and that we stand by the people of Ukraine and their right 
to decide the future of their country,' a UK government source said.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said last night that Nato must ‘toughen up’ to deal with the modern-day threats it
 faces - including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist 
threats from ISIS in Iraq, and the rising control of Boko Haram in 
northern Africa.

He spoke after attending a meeting of 
the Government’s Cobra emergency committee in the wake of the latest 
video apparently showing the beheading of a second US journalist.

Mr
 Fallon did not comment in detail on the killing, nor on a British 
hostage who has been threatened by Islamic State extremists, at the 
conference.

But he called for changes to Nato, 
including a faster response to threats, better co-operation, and a 
commitment by all members to increase their defence spending.

He told the Royal United 
Services Institute (Rusi) conference: ‘Despite certain similarities to 
the Cold War era, it is obvious now that we live in rather different 
times.

‘The world is more 
interconnected than it’s ever been. The threats have evolved since Nato 
last focused on collective defence. We are now witnessing almost daily 
atrocities unfold across the Middle East.

‘Yesterday
 Isil fanatics appears to add the sickening killing of Steven Sotloff to
 the long litany of barbaric acts that have been committed.’

He
 said member states faced a ‘stark choice’, to either ‘ enfeeble’ the 
alliance by letting investment dry up, or by ‘reviving its spirit’.

‘Let me be very clear about the UK’s 
position,’ he said. ‘It’s time now to toughen up so that Nato can deal 
with the aggression and the threats that we face.

‘That
 means rapid reaction forces that are worthy of the name, that means 
better sharing of capability, and it means the first ever public 
commitment to increase defence spending.

‘That
 will demonstrate to all those who threaten us that the state of our 
transatlantic bond is strong. The unpredictable and uncertain threats of
 today and tomorrow demand nothing less than that.’

Calling
 for Britain’s Nato allies to increase their defence investment to prove
 the alliance ‘means business’, Mr Fallon warned the United States will 
not go on ‘picking up the cheque’ if Europe chooses to prioritise social
 welfare spending when ‘threats are on our doorstep’.

He
 said: ‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way. Like
 any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in.’

His comments echo those made yesterday
 by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who told Nato parliamentarians: 
‘European Nato allies cannot expect the US to continue to carry the 
burden of defending Europe if European taxpayers are not willing to 
invest in their own security.’

It
 was also revealed today that the Ministry of Defence is signing a 
£3.5billion contract for almost 600 new armoured vehicles on the eve of 
the summit.

Britain will make the case at the meeting for increased defence spending by the alliance's 28 member states.

The contract for 589 Scout Specialist Vehicles, being signed at General Dynamics in Oakdale, south Wales, is the largest single order placed by the MoD for armoured vehicles for more than 30 years.

Delivery of the first vehicles is expected in 2017, with a training establishment and first squadron due to be equipped by mid-2019 and a brigade ready to deploy by the end of 2020.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who was today travelling to the summit venue near Newport ahead of tomorrow’s opening of the two-day gathering, said the contract would secure 1,300 jobs across the UK and sustain 300 posts in Wales.

The police presence in Newport has been increased ahead of the summit which will host more than 60 delegates from 28 countries and thousands of support staff
