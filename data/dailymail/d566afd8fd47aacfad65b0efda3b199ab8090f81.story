Trayvon Martins parents have opened up about their fears for their remaining son, saying that while they still have faith in the justice system, they are now more afraid about what they should tell Trayvon's older brother.

'I'm very afraid right now because i have no clue what to tell him. I have no clue if I should tell him to run or walk, I have no clue if I should tell him to defend himself or just lay there,' Sybrina Fulton said of her son Jahvaris.

The outrage about the not guilty verdict acquitting George Zimmerman of murdering Trayvon has not simmered, and as the grieving parents were interviewed about their reaction to the news, and how they decided to skip that final day of the trial.

'I'm very afraid right now because i have no clue what to tell him. I have no clue if I should tell him to run or walk, I have no clue if I should tell him to defend himself or just lay there,' Sybrina Fulton said of her son Jahvaris.

Opening up: Thursday was the first time that Trayvon's parents talked about the trial, making a number of television appearances

Ms Fulton, Trayvon's father Tracy Martin and their attorney Benjamin Crump all appeared on Anderson Cooper's show Thursday night to talk about how they chose not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read because they assumed they would have an outburst, which is strictly against the court rules.

'Either way, how could you be quiet? How could you not show any emotions?' Ms Fulton said. Instead, they watched the verdict come on television, and she said that not being in the room- knowing that no one was there to see their reaction- 'took the sting out' but it didn't stop the pain.

'It literally broke us down,' she said.

'I just thought the human side of them would say "Listen, this was a kid, this guy made a mistake." This wasn't a burglar or just for him to 
suggest that he was a burglar or in any means that he was committing a 
crime, it’s just not true. It's just absolutely not true,' Ms Fulton 
said.

The two parents remained composed in tonight's interview, just as they have in a number of other discussions today. Even during the lengthy trial, they sat in the courtroom without breaking for the vast majority of the hearings.

The only exception came when pictures of their slain son, or testimony about the brusining on his body, was shown to the courtroom as it proved too much for Ms Fulton to bare.

A mother's heartache: Ms Fulton said that her faith has helped her through the killing

'Those things were more hurtful to me, and sometimes I could sit through it and sometimes I had to just go and sit by myself and say a prayer and ask God to send strength to me,' she said.

One thing that helped was their decision to never interact with Zimmerman or his relatives in the courtroom.

'We refrained from even looking his way. We didn't want our emotions to run high...because we knew that our son’s legacy was running in our hands,' she said.

'We needed to be in the courtroom to let them see that we were Trayvon.'

Much has been made about Juror B37 who has elected to come forward and talk about her rationale that led to the not guilty verdict. One complaint that came forth was that the jury- which was made up of five white women and one Hispanic woman- had an easier time empathizing with Zimmerman than with the black teenager.

Martin's parents said her interview with Anderson Cooper just days ago made that painfully clear as she repeatedly used the words 'they' and 'them' to describe African Americans.

'From the beginning of the trial, she had her mind made up. No doubt. No doubt,' Mr Martin said.

'When I heard the verdict, I kind of understand the disconnect: they didn't see Trayvon as their son.

They didn't see Trayvon as a teenager. They didn't see trayvon as a human being who was just minding their own business,' Ms Fulton said.

Pledge: Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton have started a foundation named after their son and say they hope his death and the trial can serve as a catalyst to bring the country together

As a result of the trial, many African American parents- including the Martins- have come forward about their confusion about what they should tell their children in regards to how to interact with strangers and the police.

'By us living in a diverse community, we really don't have to have the conversation where you have to be afraid of every different race because they grew up going to school with other nationalities,' Mr Martin said.

'When you have a situation where an unarmed teenager is shot in the heart, what is it that I can tell my child now?'

Adding
to the confusion is the fact that no meaningful change has yet taken 
place, and their lawyer pointed out that it sets a 'terrible' precedent 
for future cases as anyone who comes out alive from a similar 
altercation has the upper hand in terms of crafting the narrative.

Picking sides: The juror who spoke out seemed to sympathize with Zimmerman and understand his point of view more than the victim, Trayvon Martin

Inside the courtroom: The unidentified juror said that she felt Zimmerman was justified in killing Trayvon Martin because he felt threatened, even though she admits Zimmerman may have 'enhanced' the story

The most telling sign that nothing has truly changed is the fact that George Zimmerman will now be given his gun back.

'That's troubling,' Mr Martin said. 'That's very troubling and it's troubling because he made a statement on Hannity if he had to do it all over again, he wouldn't change anything.'

In spite of what legal analysts have suggested about the prosecution overreaching with the charge, both parents maintained that there was enough proof to convict the man who shot their son.

'We thought there was enough evidence there no matter who was on that jury to convict him of second degree murder and when you think about it, I think they just took into account what George Zimmerman said was the truth,' Mr Martin said.
