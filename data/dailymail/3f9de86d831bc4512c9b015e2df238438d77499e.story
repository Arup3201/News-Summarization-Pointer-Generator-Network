 

All things being equal Angel Di Maria should be on the Ballon d’Or podium at the end of the year. 

He made a huge contribution to Real Madrid winning the Champions League and then played a massive part in Argentina reaching the World Cup final. 

For inspiring success with both club and country he is out on his own.

Real deal: Manchester United are ready to spend £100m to take Angel Di Maria from Madrid

Of course all things are not equal. He doesn’t have the huge publicity machines behind him that other candidates have, he is not adored the world over and as far as poster-boy looks go, he’s more hall of mirrors than hall of fame. 

That in part is why Real Madrid are happy to let him go. The image just isn’t there; the football most definitely is.

Carlo Ancelotti, who only cares about football and is not the slightest bit interested in image, wants to keep Di Maria. He helped reinvent him last season just to keep him in the side.

Last summer Gareth Bale, Isco and Cristiano Ronaldo were set to play behind Karim Benzema in a 4-2-3-1 with Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric in midfield.

When Bale missed much of the start of the campaign Di Maria was able to continue playing wide, but when Bale returned he was dropped undeservedly, booed by a mindless minority who just wanted to see the expensive new signing, and in one match responded to being taken off by grabbing his crotch for the cameras as he walked off as if to say: ‘That’s what I think of that’.

Ancelotti kept the faith because he knew the assists, the goals and the incredible stamina would be invaluable as Madrid tried to win the Treble. As Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella said during the last World Cup: ‘The longer the game goes on the more he seems to run.'

Ancelotti found a way to play Di Maria by switching to a 4-3-3, which didn’t really suit Isco, and which was perfect for the Argentine’s box-to-box energy. 

There was now no room for him as a winger because of Bale’s arrival on one flank and Ronaldo’s presence on the other but on the left of a midfield three, he was outstanding. Just not outstanding enough to curb the insatiable thirst for new players and the need for someone big to be sold to fund the latest arrivals.

The line coming out of Madrid is that Di Maria wants to go but it’s more a case of him taking the hint as every year Real Madrid buy someone who plays in his position. Last year it was Bale and this year it’s James Rodriguez.

He is also depicted as a money grabber who always wants a pay-rise but what he wants is something approaching parity with Bale, Benzema and new man Rodriguez. Why shouldn’t he ask for that after the season he has just had? 

Instead Madrid have him on around £2.4million  take-home pay a year that puts him in the third bracket of their wage structure, behind midfield team-mate Modric and a long way from the club’s top earners.

Room for improvement: Manchester United started the season by losing at home to Swansea on Saturday

Not since ushering Arjen Robben towards the exit in 2009, much to the displeasure of then coach Manuel Pellegrini, have Real been so keen to lose such an important player. We all know what happened to Robben after he left the Bernabeu – three Champions League finals and one World Cup final – so maybe Manchester United would be wise to move for Robben Mark II.

The only lingering question mark would hang over where he might fit into Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 template at United. He could perhaps operate to the right of Luke Shaw in the five across the middle although that could leave Juan Mata and Ander Herrera contesting the same position. He could play in attack or in midfield in a 4-3-3 but where does Mata fit into that system?

Di Maria’s flexibility would certainly help Van Gaal complete the attacking puzzle although one question would still need to be answered: Why spend £100m on Di Maria when most agree centre back and central midfield are the team’s real problem positions?
