Actress Barbara Hershey has admitted that Hollywood is 'a desert' for women her age, but that she is happy to embrace the aging process - which seems to be unfolding pretty slowly in her case.

The 66-year-old Insidious actress, who looks staggeringly youthful for her age, has accredited her fresh appearance to a number of wise lifestyle choices over the years.

'I think I've always looked about ten years younger than I am all my life,' she tells ABC News, adding: 'Being healthy [helps]. I'm not a drinker. I haven't abused myself.'

The brunette star also insists she 'doesn't do surgery' and that she is careful with her diet.

'I don't eat sugar and I don't eat grains, at least in this point in my life,' she reveals. 'It's been really a positive thing for me.'

Ms Hershey, who played Natalie Portman's obsessive mother in Darren Aronofsky's Oscar-winning hit, Black Swan, in 2010, acknowledged the fact that Hollywood parts are scarce for older actresses.

'It really is a desert for women my age.
 I hate saying that publicly because it sounds like you are complaining,
 but it's just the facts,' she says.

Ms Hershey points to Game of Thrones as an example of a hugely successful show which includes a full 'spectrum' of people of all ages in 'equally important' roles.

On the subject of her own aging, the Golden Globe-winning actress announced she was 'not afraid' of the process. 'I'm afraid of everyone else's reaction to my aging!' she laughs.

Ms Hershey quoted legendary actor, the late Peter O'Toole, as saying that the best thing to him about wrinkles was that he had earned every one of them.

And she wholeheartedly agrees, adding that her wrinkles are the 'map of her life', something to 'hang on to and adore'.

Throwback: Ms Hershey, pictured here in 1970, earned herself a guilty-by-association reputation after she married notorious drug-user David Carradine in 1969, which damaged her career for a while

The sprightly siren says she spends part of her time in Hawaii, 'getting up with the sun' and enjoys painting.

But her life hasn't always been so smooth sailing.Â 

Acquiring a reputation as something of a hippie early on in her career, which begun when she was only 17, Ms Hershey suffered a blow to her prestige when, in 1969, she married controversial actor David Carradine.

For the duration of her marriage to Mr Carradine, who was a regular drug-user and passed away in 2009, her private life was scrutinized and ridiculed.

I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career

She earned herself a guilty-by-association reputation, which she has since claimed was unfounded.

'Producers wouldn't see me because I had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable,' she said in a 1975 interview. 'I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career.'

Ms Hershey also discusses one of her latest films, Sister, an Indie movie about a dysfunctional family in which she plays a bipolar mother.

The actress says she turned to YouTube to watch real clips of bipolar sufferers who film themselves during 'manic' or 'depressed' phases. She adds that she also took inspiration from a number of her bipolar friends, who she describes as 'amazing, creative' people who 'go through a lot'.

Sister will be released later this year.
