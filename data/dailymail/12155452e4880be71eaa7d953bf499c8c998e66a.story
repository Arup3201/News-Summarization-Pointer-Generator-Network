Prime Minister Tony Abbott should take a page out of his arch-nemesis Kevin Rudd's book by getting on social media and mingling more with the community.

That's the suggestion of the owner of the country pub Mr Abbott dropped in on last week, after the nation's leader was told he needs to get away from his 'latte-sipping' advisers and put his policies to the 'pub test'. 

Mr Abbott chugged a couple of beers at the Union Club Hotel in Colac for around 40 minutes last Friday and today hailed his visit to the pub as a 'thrill' in a 'make or break' speech today.

Publican Warwick Newman said it was 'great' to have the Prime Minister drop in and buy punters drinks.

Mr Abbott said it was a 'thrill' to visit the pub in Colac - although locals advised he should head out of the office more and press the flesh as Kevin Rudd does

Mr Abbott today announced he was ditching his paid parental leave scheme and pledged not to raise the GST without a political consensus

'He was great,' said Mr Newman. 'He was very, very accommodating.

'He had a lot of selfies. He just had a few beers.'

'No one was hitting him up with the hard questions,' he said, and there wasn't any curly questions about his knighting of Prince Philip.  

But Mr Newman said it wouldn't hurt for Mr Abbott to take some inspiration from his predecessor, Mr Rudd.

'I think as the prime minister of the country a lot of your day is orchestrated - people are expecting you, you're opening something.

'To go and do something totally like, "I'm in the car, let's go to the pub", I guess it was probably a little bit different for him because people weren't expecting it of him. I think it's something he hasn't done. 

'They could probably learn a bit off someone like Kevin Rudd - voted in by young people based on social media and his presence in the community, in that respect.

'Tony Abbott's probably a little more straight down the line. It's probably not going to hurt.' 

Former prime minister Kevin Rudd often went on walks through Queen St Mall in Brisbane, hosted community cabinets and was very popular on social media

'They could probably learn a bit off someone like Kevin Rudd - voted in by young people based on social media and his presence in the community, in that respect,' Mr Newman said

Colac, a town of around 10,000, is located in the federal seat of Corangimite. 

It was a Labor seat prior to the 2013 federal election, when  Liberal MP Sarah Henderson swept previous member Darren Cheeseman from power.

Reflecting on Mr Abbott's recent decisions, Mr Newman said he thought Prince Philip was deserving of the knighthood, based on his record.

But he still had a dose of real talk for the PM.

'He's done a lot for Australia. There' s a lot of facts behind it.

'Whether it's a slap in the face to someone like Dawn Fraser, who knows.'

'He's deserving, yes. Should he have been given it? Probably not.'

National Party MP Michael McCormack last week urged Mr Abbott to visit the Royal Hotel in Grong Grong, west of Wagga Wagga NSW, to get an 'honest appraisal' of how the government could improve.

In an interview with Fairfax Media, Mr McCormack said Mr Abbott needed to get away from the 'texting, latte-sipping, keyboard warriors who frequent the tapas bars of Sydney and Melbourne'.

Mr Abbott today said he had been 'warmly' welcomed at the Colac pub.  

Controversial pick: Mr Abbott today announced all honours will henceforth be decided by the Order of Australia Council - not by himself, as happened with the knighthood of Prince Philip (above)
