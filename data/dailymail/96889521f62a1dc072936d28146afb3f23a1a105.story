Police in Spain have apologised afterÂ a highly suggestive lingerie advert was used to demonstrate first aid techniques to the public.

Officers in the city of Jaca showed footage from two advertisements by the Fortnight Lingerie brand to members of the public who attended an open seminar at their headquarters in Zaragoza province on Monday afternoon.

The clips show near-naked underwear models pretending to perform CPR and the Heimlich manoeuvre on each other while pulling provocative poses as the camera zooms in on their bodies.

Inappropriate: Officers in the city of Jaca showed footage from two advertisements by the Fortnight Lingerie brand to members of the public who attended an open seminar

Provocative: The clips show near-naked underwear models pretending to perform CPR and the Heimlich manoeuvre on each other

Sexual: During the adverts, the camera repeatedly zooms in on the models' near-naked bodies

Officials at Zaragoza's police headquarters told El Heraldo newspaper they were very sorry for showing the 'inappropriate videos' and insisted they would not be used in future demonstrations.

They did insist, however, that the audience were informed they would be shown a video featuring women in underwear during the seminar, although admitted it hadn't been made clear that the footage would be provocative.

Several attendees made formal complaints after the seminar and demanded apologies from both the speakers and the police force as a whole.

They argued that the videos were sexist and had no place in a first aid training course.

Warning: They did insist, however, that the audience were informed they would be shown a video featuring women in underwear during the seminar

The course was organised by the Zaragoza police after a request of Jaca City Council. The idea had been to create a tongue-in-cheek seminar with 'ironic' footage that would live long in the memory, according to El Heraldo.

The seminar itself was taken by a doctor and a nurse, with attendees telling the newspaper that women in the audience were made to feel uncomfortable throughout the session, not just while the videos were played, due to the suggestive nature of the speech.

The videos themselves are actually underwear adverts made by Fortnight Lingerie.

They have been freely available to watch online since 2010, gathering tens of thousands of views over the last four years.

Fortnight Lingerie was set up in 2010 in Toronto, Canada and is sold online and in shops throughout North America.

The provocative first aid-themed commercials were the company's first major advertising project.
