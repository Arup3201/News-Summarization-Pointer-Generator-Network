A British Airways flight was forced to make an emergency landing at a Canadian town after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck.

The Boeing 777, carrying 158 passengers from Heathrow to Philadelphia, made the unscheduled stop at Goose Bay, in Newfoundland, in temperatures of -30C after fumes started to cause eye and throat irritation halfway through the eight hour flight. The co-pilot also became incapacitated after he started to feel nauseous nearly half an hour later.Â 

Oxygen masks were then required for the captain and first officer, so they could make the landing last Sunday, according to the Sunday Express.

The news comes just two weeks after the first picture was released of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes.

Last month it was reported Richard Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, passed away.

Both claimed they had been poisoned by the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force pilots to wear oxygen masks.

Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry.

They say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor claims.

Official records from the Civil Aviation Authority show that pilots and crew have to put on their oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat suspected 'fume events'.

The Sunday Express report suggests the latest incident was on an aircraft which made an emergency landing in October 2009 after five passengers fainted or felt ill due to suspected fumes.

The airline has denied any link between the two incidents, according to the report.

Following the latest incident, a BA spokesman said: 'Safety is always our top priority and the captain took the right decision to divert. We are sorry our customers' journey was delayed.'
