With their intricate patterns and perfectly circular shape, it is hard to believe these magical creations are actually made of ice.

These stunning images capture the beauty of liquid droplets in their first moments after they start freezing.

The spectacles - caught on camera by photographer Angela Kelly - were created using homemade bubble solution.

They can be seen resting on the ground, flowers and delicate blades of grass.

To create the sculptures, Ms Kelly scattered bubbles around 
the garden of her home in Washington, US, which has recently seen fierce storms and freezing temperatures.

She then waited for the fragile balls of water to start to transform into ice, before capturing the results on camera.

She said the ice spectacles, featuring an array of unique patterns, had left her and her son 'awestruck'.

'It was a really cold day when I took the bubble pictures,' she said. 'My son was bored, so I just decided to experiment 
in the front garden and the results were incredible.

'The process was just a bit of fun, but at the end of it I had some amazing images - we were awestruck.'

Ms Kelly, who runs her own photography firm, Kelly Images and Photography, said droplets of liquid, such as water, made 'amazing pictures'.

'I always look at them on blades of grass or on flowers in the garden and visually they can be quite stunning.

'It is amazing what you can see when you take the time to look at things in a different light.

'I
 just want to show the world that it's worth taking a minute to have a 
look at your surroundings and you'll be amazed at what you can see and 
do.'
