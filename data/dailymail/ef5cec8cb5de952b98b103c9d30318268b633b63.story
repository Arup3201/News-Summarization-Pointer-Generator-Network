Charged: Rebecca Bradbury, who had almost £1,000 taken from her account by Orange for a bill she racked up checking her emails abroad

A holidaymaker was left penniless when Orange took almost £1,000 from her bank account in data roaming charges.

Rebecca Bradbury, 25, says she asked the operator about possible high fees before her two-week trip to Thailand.

She says she was reassured that she would receive warning texts if she spent too much. She also bought a ‘bolt-on’ package of an extra 10MB of data for £12.77.

She said: ‘The person on the phone said there is a scheme that automatically stops customers using more than £50 worth of data when they are roaming, which is opt-out only.

‘Of course, I didn’t opt out of it. I’d heard about all these horror stories, and I wanted to be careful. I never thought it would happen to me.’

Miss Bradbury says she used her iPhone 4 a couple of times to check her emails and Facebook during her trip in May.

But when she checked her bank balance, she found Orange had charged her £786.67 for the month and had taken it directly out of her account.

The conference company worker, whose bill is usually around £55, insisted: ‘I 100 per cent did not receive any texts from Orange saying that I was over the extra I paid for, let alone the £50 limit.

‘When I noticed all that money was gone from my bank, I first thought I had been robbed. I treated myself to the holiday because I had just finished at one job, and was waiting to start another.

‘The money that Orange took was meant to pay for my rent and food for June before I started my new job. I burst into tears.

‘Luckily some of my friends were able to help me out, otherwise I would have been in deep trouble and probably evicted.’

Refund: Orange said that Miss Bradbury, who has been a customer for seven years, 'did not choose the most appropriate bundle for her usage'

Miss Bradbury, of Tooting Bec, south-west London, rang Orange after seeing her bill.

The firm would not admit any fault and
 said she could expect a further bill for £123.79 in June, covering the 
last three days of her trip, for a total of £910.46.

She said: ‘For most of the last two 
days, I was flying home. I don’t know if an app was leaking data, but I 
definitely wasn’t using my phone very much.

‘They shouldn’t be able to take so much money from people’s accounts without warning them.’

Orange yesterday said buying ‘bundles’ of data to use abroad invalidates the £50 data limit.

Miss Bradbury said: ‘I definitely 
asked about whether the £50 cap was still in place when I bought the 
data bundle, and they said it was.

‘The customer service person said I 
didn’t need to worry because I would get notifications by text when I 
used the 10MB, and again when I had used £50.’

Orange has offered her a £200 refund.

The telecoms giant said it always recommends buying a data bundle when 
using a phone abroad, adding: ‘When you purchase a bundle you’re told 
that you’re opting out of that cap.

‘Miss Bradbury did not purchase the 
most appropriate bundle for her usage. We’ve updated our bundles since, 
so we cannot reveal the other options available at that time.’
