Actors sparked outrage today after Nazi war scenes were filmed at a West Sussex airport - just 24 hours before the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

Stars of new Second World War film Woman in Gold, starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, could be seen filming at Shoreham Airport in West Sussex dressed in full Nazi uniform today.

Some rode around on motorbikes, while others could be seen climbing in and out of military vehicles.

Pictures from the scene also showed two swastika flags erected just metres from a war memorial.

Two flags with swastikas were erected outside a West Sussex airport today during filming of Woman in Gold - just 24 hours before the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landing in Normandy, France

The structure, which features a propeller from a B-26 bomber, includes a tribute which reads: 'To all British commonwealth and allied servicemen and women who gave their lives during the first and second world wars.'

Huge panels displaying the Nazi emblem were also hung from outside the airport. Witnesses say they could be seen from hundreds of metres away.

Local residents today reacted in anger at the filming - which comes just 24 hours before veterans across the world honor the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy.

Councillor Peter Metcalfe, a war veteran who was in the army for 11 years, branded the move 'insensitive', 'shocking' and 'crazy'.

He said: 'I'm shocked. I had no idea they were flying swastika flags at the airport.

'It's very insensitive given the timing. I think it is crazy. I can totally understand why locals are upset - I am myself.

'They should stop filming immediately and show a bit more respect. They should cease filming for the rest of the weekend while we honour the D-Day anniversary.

'As much as we welcome filming in this area as it brings in jobs and work, I don't think it's right. Not at this time. I am going to go down there first thing to ensure filming is stopped.'

One local, who did not wish to be named, said: 'There were about 150 cast and crew there. It was a real operation. Lots of them were in 1940s gear.

'There were three massive great bit swastika flags flying high above the airport. They were so close to the war memorial.

'It wouldn't take much thought to realise how insensitive it is to put them up just before D-Day. It is unbelievable.

'Clearly no consideration was made to the sensitivity of locals and residents around there. Lots of people just couldn't believe it.

'It makes me think the crews just can't have spotted the war memorial. Putting those flags up is so thoughtless.'

The witness said they could not see either Helen Mirren or Ryan Reynolds on site today.

They added they believed the flags would be left there overnight.

Lloyd Dean wrote on Facebook: 'There's some nazi film being made at shoreham airport wtf so sick.'

The filming comes just months after producers of Brad Pitt movie Fury filmed Nazi war scenes early in the morning on Remembrance Sunday.

American director David Ayer staged pre-dawn explosions in Shirburn, Oxfordshire and had extras act out battle scenes dressed as Nazis while the rest of the country readied itself to honour the nation's fallen heroes.

Bosses behind the film reportedly refused to stop filming over the weekend, despite a plea from the nearby Watlington Parish Council.

Woman in Gold, starring Ryan Reynolds, left, sees Helen Mirren play real-life heroine Maria Altmann - a Jewish WWII survivor battling the Austrian government to retrieve numerous painting she had stolen from her

Woman in Gold, which is directed by Simon Curtis, is a BBC Films backed project due to be released in 2015.

The director previously worked with BBC for film My Week With Marylin - which was about the late Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe.

In the movie, Helen Mirren will play real-life heroine Maria Altmann - a Jewish Second World War survivor.

The plot follows her struggle against the Austrian government to retrieve several paintings by Gustav Klimt that were stolen from her family during the conflict.

A spokeswoman from production company Freud's production company said: 'Shoreham Airport is the only location that is in keeping with the period and today was the only day possible. Shooting has now completed.'
