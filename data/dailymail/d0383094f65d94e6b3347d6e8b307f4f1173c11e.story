HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Grappling and blocking in the box is THE No 1 issue I am asked about by football people. It used to be foul language (but it is seven years since a top-flight player was sent off for that offence) and then  goal-line technology (but that’s been dealt with effectively).

It is time to now deal with grappling and holding in the penalty area. Tackling this issue is long overdue. It’s not about a change in the law, it’s about the appropriate enforcement of the law.

Grabbing, holding, grappling: however you describe it, is pure cheating. It’s an issue that is preventing goals from being scored.

I remember my Sportsmail colleague Jamie Carragher saying towards the end of his playing career: ‘If referees gave it [fouls for holding in the box], we wouldn’t do it.’

Applying the law is an easy win for referees. They cannot award a penalty if the ball is not in play, but they can issue a yellow card. 

Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo both appear to grapple Ivanovic and John Terry at a Chelsea corner 

Giving a penalty is a massive thing for a referee, but interrupting the game before a corner or free-kick can be taken to issue a yellow card to culprits is easily enforceable. 

We already see referees prevent corners being taken so they can verbally warn players about holding and grappling. It’s time for the talk to stop and the cards to come out.

On Sunday at Old Trafford we saw Robin van Persie cautioned for removing his shirt after scoring a late equaliser. No-one blamed the referee. Everyone blamed the player. We need that same mental attitude here.

This HANDS OFF IN THE BOX campaign can successfully assimilate into the game yellow cards for holding in the box, so it’s not something out of the ordinary. Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned – and sent off if you’ve been booked already. Once fans, managers and – crucially – players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.

Ricardo Carvalho was a master at it during his Chelsea days and Ryan Shawcross still does it for Stoke. He doesn’t even look at the ball, his focus is entirely on holding his man, preventing him from reaching the ball and scoring the goal we all want to see. Martin Skrtel does it for Liverpool, too.

A direct free-kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force:

• kicks or attempts to kick an opponent

• trips or attempts to trip an opponent

• jumps at an opponent

• charges an opponent

• strikes or attempts to strike an opponent

• pushes an opponent

• tackles an opponent

A penalty is awarded if an offence is committed by a player inside his own penalty area, irrespective of the position of the ball, provided it is in play.

An indirect free-kick is also awarded to the opposing team if, in the opinion of the referee, a player:

• plays in a dangerous manner

• impedes the progress of an opponent

• prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his hands

Referees and their assistants can officiate tactically. The worst offenders of this holding practice are easily identified – I’ve already mentioned Shawcross, but Chris Smalling was at it against Chelsea and Branislav Ivanovic is no stranger to this dark art - and they can look out for them at the key moments during a game.

Blocking is a more difficult offence to determine. Impending the progress of an opponent should be penalised by an indirect free-kick. Grappling, shirt-pulling, holding and blocking are stains on the game and referees should apply the law when they see these offences.

I’ll be watching and detecting in all the big matches – starting at Loftus Road tonight as QPR host Aston Villa. I will be naming and shaming the culprits and the referees who fail to hold them to account. And so will my Sportsmail colleagues.

Ryan and Co, you have been warned.
