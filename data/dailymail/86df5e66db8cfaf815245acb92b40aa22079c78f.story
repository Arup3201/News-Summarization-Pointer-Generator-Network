Ask almost any American adult about the Iran hostage crisis, and you'll get the outlines of the well-known story: militants storming the American embassy in Tehran in 1979 and holding dozens of Americans hostage for 444 days.

Now, CIA disguise master Antonio Mendez has lifted the lid on a less well known story, one with just as much suspense - how, amid the chaos, six Americans escaped.

For almost three months, the group hid out in Iran, sheltered by the Canadian government. But the situation grew increasingly precarious.

Junior partner: Former CIA agent Antonio Mendez, pictured in 1999, is releasing a book, Agro, about his daring plot to rescue six hostages from Tehran in 1979

Ultimately, the CIA sent two operatives into the country to rescue the group. 

As cover, the CIA concocted an elaborate back story involving a Hollywood film.

Mendez developed a plan to disguise the Americans as a Hollywood group scouting locations for a fake science-fiction film called Argo.

Mendez didn't do anything halfway. He obtained a script, advertised the film, printed business cards, and rented and staffed a Hollywood office in case anyone in Iran checked up on the story.

Taken captive: Six Americans were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1970 by their militant Iranian captors

Real deal: Mendez had this poster manufactured as part of the rescue

Then, posing as the film's producer, 
he slipped into Tehran, helped transform the embassy workers into 
Hollywood types and spirited the Americans on a plane to Switzerland.

For years, however, the full story of the CIA's involvement was a secret. 

That changed in 1997, the 50th anniversary of the CIA.

Mendez was honoured by the agency that year, and he related the Argo story for newsman Dan Rather.

Now, in what is an ironic twist, the fake movie caper is becoming the plot of a real Hollywood film.

It's set for release October 12, and Ben Affleck directs and stars as Mendez.

Readers who want the un-Hollywood version will find that besides being a talented spy, Mendez is also a gifted storyteller. 

The Maryland resident has also written previously about his clandestine work in The Master of Disguise and Spy Dust.

His latest book is a page turner despite the fact readers know from the beginning how the story will end.
