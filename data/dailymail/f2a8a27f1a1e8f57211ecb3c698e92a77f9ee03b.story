Louis van Gaal has a new crop of injury concerns after Manchester United overcame Yeovil Town 2-0 in a bruising FA Cup third round tie.

Rafael da Silva suffered a fractured cheekbone in a first-half aerial duel and had to be taken off at half time, while his defensive partner Paddy McNair needed staples in his head after a sickening clash with Kieffer Moore.

Van Gaal also revealed that another defender, Luke Shaw, had suffered a fresh ankle problem after he too was withdrawn at the break after playing through the pain barrier.

The Dutch manager has been plagued by injuries since arriving at Old Trafford and the latest casualties join Ashley Young, Marcos Rojo, Antonio Valencia, Daley Blind and Marouane Fellaini on the treatment table.

Van Gaal said: 'I think we had a lot of problems in the first half. You noticed that Rafa Da Silva has an injury, a fissure of his bone.

'It was fantastic that he played through [until half-time] but I had to change him and also Luke Shaw has an ankle problem so I had to change him also.'

United were pushed hard by the League One strugglers at Huish Park but prevailed thanks to second-half goals from Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria.

Van Gaal was full of praise for Yeovil and their 'fantastic' performance. He said: 'I have to give my highest respect to the managers and the players.

'In the first-half they didn't give us any time to us to play the ball, there was a lot of pressure. In the second, you don't know whether it is us or the tiredness of their players.

'It was fantastic how they pressed the ball. It is more difficult to beat the pressure. In the second half we played better but it also takes a long time to score the goal because it is not so easy.

'Everyone thinks "OK, these players are from Man United, 100m euros against 5,000 euros" but it is not like that.

'We played also with the Netherlands against teams who are much more expensive in the World Cup but you can organise your team like the manager of Yeovil has done and when they believe in it, you can do a lot.'

Johnson's men were tenacious and matched United for long spells, their resistance only broken when Herrera produced a sensational volley on 64 minutes.

Di Maria, introduced from the bench with 30 minutes left, made sure there would be no upset when Rooney played him clear to sprint 50 yards and clip in a second.

Johnson said: 'The game was bittersweet, I'm so proud of the boys for the effort they put in. We wanted to affect the game and give them a fright.

'I thought we did that, we had that first chance before we did that. You have to have a high energy when you're playing a top team like Man United, especially when they have millions of pounds of players.'

When Van Gaal's complimentary comments were mentioned, Johnson added: 'He's a very honest person, he's not making it up. It was important this club put on this event, so everyone is happy, the supporters are happy. We're proud of our club. All we can do is hope and wait for another chance.'
