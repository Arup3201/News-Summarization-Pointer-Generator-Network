Victim: David Burgess, 63, known as Sonia, died in October, last year

A 35-year-old man today admitted pushing a cross-dressing top lawyer under a Tube train during the rush hour.

Human rights solicitor David Burgess, 63, known as Sonia, died in October last year, after falling in front of a train at Kingâ€™s Cross station, central London.

Senthooran Kanagasingham, of Cricklewood, north London, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility.

But the prosecution at the Old Bailey refused to accept the plea and a jury was sworn to try him for murder, which he denies.

Kanagasingham, had been undergoing sex change therapy at the time and used the name Nina.

The shaven-headed defendant, wearing a shirt and grey jumper, claims he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time.

The pair had been to see Nina's GP to 
get a repeat prescription for a combined anti-depressant and sedative 
when it is alleged animosity brewed up between them.

Sonia told the doctor about her concerns
about Nina's level's of stress and anxiety and that she was waiting for
a psychiatric appointment, it was said.

'Disapproving' of the interference, it is alleged Nina hatched the plot 
to kill Sonia as they made their way back to central London from
the Cricklewood surgery.

As they waited for a westbound 
Piccadilly Line train at King's Cross underground station, Nina allegedly struck 
just after 6.35pm at the height of the evening rush hour on October 25 
of last year.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'She had been pushed from behind into a
path of an oncoming train, which was travelling along the busy 
platform, in front of a number of shocked onlookers.

'The push was entirely deliberate and it was executed with the intention of killing Sonia Burgess.

'After all it could hardly have been done with any lesser intention than
to send Sonia to her death. The person who did that was this defendant.

'Each was well known to the other, and 
had been in the company of the other for around an hour-and-a-half 
before that calculated push that was to end Sonia Burgess's life.'

The Old Bailey was told that Sonia was born a man called David Burgess.

In her professional life as an immigration and human rights solicitor, 
she was known by her male name.

But in her personal life the divorcee was known as 'Sonia Jardiniere' or
Sonia Burgess and her three children, two daughters who live in Canada 
and a son who live in Korea, were happy with her lifestyle.

Mr Altman added: 'She was gender variant. She had no desire to become a 
woman through gender reassignment and all that that entails.

'Everyone including her children 
both accepted and embraced this. The evidence suggests this made her 
happy and her happiness being of importance to her children made them 
happy for her.'

The devout Christian worshipped at St
Martins-in-the Field in Trafalgar Square near to her home in 
Shaftesbury Avenue in London's theatreland and was on hand to help 
others.

He said: 'As a person she was caring 
and generous with her time. She was tolerant of others and habitually 
helped others with their problems. The defendant was one such person.'

He told the court Nina was born a man called Senthooran Kanagasingham in Sri Lanka and came to the UK in 2000.

By 2010 he was 'going through the process of gender reassignment' and 
'it had become his desire to pass as a woman.'

Sonia befriended Nina 
after they met at a bar or club but 'at first Sonia was wary of the 
defendant because she suspected Nina, as she knew Senthooran 
Kanagasingham, was having hormonal treatment.

'From past experiences she had had, this could render the person 
volatile, over emotional and unbalanced.'

Because Nina was temporarily 
homeless, Sonia allowed her to use her flat to shower but over time 
found her 'needy' and was 'lapsing into psychosis.'

On the day of her 
murder Sonia sent a text to a friend that said she was waiting to see a 
doctor and added 'I have a transphobic friend.'

When Sonia later raised 
her concerns, the doctor saw a disapproving look on Nina's face.

Mr Altman said: 'The prosecution say the text message provides an 
important insight into what became the developing tension between Sonia 
and Nina, culminating as it did in the defendant deciding quite 
deliberately to push Sonia under the train at King's Cross a mere hour 
later.

'It was, say the prosecution, born of anger and malice.'

The jury heard 
Nina, who know wishes to be known by his male name Senthooran 
Kanagasingham, denies murder but has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on 
the grounds of diminished responsibility.

However Mr Altman said the plea was not acceptable to the prosecution.

The trail expected to last two weeks continues.
