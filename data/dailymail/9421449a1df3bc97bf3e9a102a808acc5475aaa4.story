Stuart Ankers admitted theft after stealing more than 50,000 Panini World Cup stickers

A driver stole more than 50,000 Panini World Cup football stickers from a warehouse, a court heard.

Stuart Ankers could have filled nearly 80 albums with the snatched collectibles, if he did not get any duplicates.

The 37-year-old helped himself to the haul of stickers from the Smiths News warehouse in Bredbury in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

The former solder had a job collecting and distributing magazines to shops around the region, but instead he began stealing the Panini boxes, each worth £600.

Stockport Magistrates Court was told he plundered the boxes over a five to six week period.

Ankers, of Oldham, was caught when warehouse bosses  became suspicious and installed CCTV.

He was captured on camera scrambling up the shelves to help himself to the stickers.

The thefts happened around May 2014, just before the World Cup in Brazil. 

 Prosecutor Mark Angus said: 'He disputed the theft at first but when he was told there was CCTV he admitted the theft to his managers.

'A male in Oldham asked him if he could get World Cup stickers. He says he was paid by box he supplied.'

Two mathematicians in Switzerland had previously worked out the World Cup sticker album would cost, on average, £450 to complete.  

With 640 stickers in the Panini World Cup sticker album and 50p for a pack of six it should cost just £63.99 to complete the collection.

However, allowing for duplicates it is estimated that 899 packs are actually needed at a cost of a whopping £449.50.  

Ankers pleaded guilty to theft from an employer at a previous hearing. However, he told magistrates' the value of his thefts was between £5,000 to £6,000.

The Crown Prosecution Service had originally placed the value at £12,000 before accepting Ankers's claim that he'd pilfered stickers worth only half the value.

The driver, who had no previous convictions for dishonesty, had been warned that he could face a custodial sentence.

He told the court: 'I was just stupid at the time, I apologise profusely.'

Ankers was ordered to fork out £1,500 compensation, 150 hours of unpaid work, a three-month curfew and £85 costs.  

He has been sacked after his theft was uncovered but the court heard how he had since secured a fresh job with a haulage firm.

Football stickers are popular around the globe

Collectible football cards and stickers have been swapped by young football fans since the late 1880s when they were frequently found inside cigarette packets.

Italian company Panini started selling packets of football stickers in the 1960s and in 1970 produced its first World Cup album to tie in with that year's tournament in Mexico - selling the stickers outside of Italy for the first time.

Football stickers took off in the UK in 1978, when the World Cup was being held in Argentina.

A 1980s market research survey revealed that more than 90 percent of boys aged between nine and 11 had bought at least one packet of football stickers.

And by the 1990s collecting stickers was a full blown phenomenon, with girls and boys alike eagerly trading 'shinys' as they tried to complete the set.

In 1994 multiple re-prints were needed for sticker company Merlin's first official Premier League collection, such was the demand.

In 2013, 29-year-old Portsmouth 
fan and comedy writer Adam Carroll-Smith made headlines when he tracked 
down the six players whose faces were missing from his 1996 Merlin 
Premier League Album.

It 
took him six months to trace Keith Curle, Stuart Ripley, Scott Minto, 
Gary Penrice, Philippe Albert and Lars Bohinen, visit them and take 
their pictures to fill in the gaps in his album, documenting his efforts
 in his book Six Stickers: A Journey To Complete An Old Sticker Album.

Every year Panini prints more than a billion stickers, and as well as football stickers also print ranges featuring cartoon characters such as Peppa Pig and bands including One Direction.

In the 2013/14 season Topps, which has owned the rights to Merlin since 1995, celebrated the 20th anniversary of the official Premier League Sticker collection.

Topps also produces Match Attax, a trading card game which also features Premier League stars.
