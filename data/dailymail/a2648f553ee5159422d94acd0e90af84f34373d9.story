Infected: Dr Craig Spencer, 33, became New York's first Ebola case when he was diagnosed on Thursday evening

Colleagues of the New Yorker who caught Ebola treating victims of the outbreak in West Africa have said he was always 'rigorous' over the elaborate safety procedures for Western doctors.

Dr Craig Spencer, 33, tested positive for Ebola on Thursday after coming back from Guinea, and is currently being treated at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan.

Today fellow health workers at a Doctors Without Borders clinic in Gueckedou said he would always follow the rules surrounding what protective gear to wear and how to disinfect it.

But they also admitted that the risk of catching Ebola comes with the territory, adding that all health workers 'rub shoulders with death every day'.

The workers, a hygienist and a social worker, were not named. The social worker said: 'We are demoralized and saddened by what's happened to Craig. He did excellent work.' 

Spencer's work included direct contact with sick people: taking their temperature, following the evolution of their cases, taking their vital signs and ensuring the clinic was properly maintained, he said.

 'I'm asking myself how he got the virus because he was a rigorous man,' added the hygienist, whose job is to clean patients, who often have severe diarrhea and are vomiting and bleeding profusely. 

'Since we learned that he was infected, we've had low morale. And we understand that we are also at risk despite the measures.'

While he was working in Guinea, where he was posted midway through September, Dr Spencer posted pictures online of himself dressed in protective gear before work.

He also sent his fiancée, Morgan Dixon, a 'photo essay' showing how he put on each of his eight layers of protection.

A friend of the couple told the New York Times: 'Eight layers later, you can’t even tell who he is. I’m just perplexed how this happened. Now no one’s going to want to go there and treat people.' 

The Gueckedou clinic is at the epicenter of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

The first cases were reported in that region in March, and the epidemic has since grown into the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, with more than 10,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths.

Treatment: Spencer is being cared for on an isolated ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan

Doctors Without Borders has been a major provider of care during the current Ebola outbreak and in all recent ones.

Its procedures for everything from how clinics should be set up to how doctors and nurses should take off protective equipment are considered the gold standard when dealing with highly infectious diseases, like Ebola.

At Ebola clinics, there are elaborate procedures for how health workers undress and disinfect their equipment and the site, and the hygienist said the disinfection teams at Gueckedou make sure those procedures are followed to the letter.

But Doctors Without Borders has warned that no matter how careful health workers are, the risk can never be zero. It said Friday that it did not yet know how Spencer became infected but that it is investigating.

Staff at the Gueckedou clinic are also redoubling their efforts to stay safe, the hygienist said.

'Since his sickness was announced, I've seen the bosses here looking to reinforce our protections and to see where there are weaknesses,' he said.

Both workers said they thought the Gueckedou clinic is well maintained, with nothing taken for granted.

The hygienist said: 'We are praying for Craig and for ourselves because we rub shoulders with death every day.'
