Neil Warnock has been sacked as manager of Crystal Palace after just four months in charge at Selhurst Park. 

The Eagles dropped into the bottom three of the Premier League on Boxing Day after a 3-1 loss to Southampton, with pressure mounting on Warnock and fans calling for his head. 

Keith Millen will once again take temporary charge, with Palace travelling to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

The club confirmed the sacking with a brief statement on their website. It said: 

'Crystal Palace Football Club can today confirm that Neil Warnock has been relieved of his duties and is no longer first-team manager.

'The club would like to put on record its thanks to Neil for all his hard work and energy over the past four months.

'Keith Millen will lead the team against Queens Park Rangers tomorrow [Sunday] as caretaker manager.'

Speaking to the Croydon Advertiser, chairman Steve Parish revealed the reason behind the sacking, while admitting that it is a priority to start negotiations with a new manager immediately.

'We have let Neil go and we have thanked him for his work,' the Palace owner said. 'It's not working out and we are looking for a reaction against QPR.

'I slept on it really and just spoke to a few people and made my mind up this morning. Neil is a great guy and he wanted to do it at Palace. It just hasn't happened.

'It just wasn't working. You always want it sorted out as soon as possible but I haven't got anyone lined up. We want to hold negotiations as soon as possible.' 

Warnock has therefore become the first managerial casualty of the Premier League season, taking charge of just 16 league games in his second stint at Selhurst Park. 

The substitution of winger Yannick Bolasie for full-back Martin Kelly, when Palace were 3-0 down to Southampton, saw fans call for Warnock's head on Boxing Day.

Chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rang around Selhurst Park, while sections of the home fans booed at the full-time whistle.

Warnock was honest in his assessment of the performance though, admitting that he expected a negative response from the Palace faithful. 

'I have no complaints, at 3-0 down, you'd be very surprised not to get a bit of stick. I thought the players were very good today in the circumstances, they were almost as shell-shocked as some of the fans.' 

Caretaker boss Millen is now in a position familiar to him, after two previous stints as caretaker manager at Selhurst Park. After the departures of Ian Holloway and Tony Pulis, it was him whom Palace called upon to take the reigns, and so it is not a position alien to the 48-year-old.

'It is not a nice position to be in again, I must admit,' Millen told Sky Sports News. 'It was a surprise this morning.

'We have all been disappointed by yesterday's result but the first-half performance was decent. We're just not taking our chances at the moment, so we've come into work this morning and I get the phone call from the chairman.

'It has been a shock for us all, but we have got to try and be professional and try and concentrate on a massive game tomorrow [Sunday].'

The Eagles face a tough trip to Loftus Road, where they take on relegation rivals QPR in what would have been a return to his old club for Warnock. 

'Neil came in this morning and we had a quick chat,' Millen continued. 'He cleared his desk and his stuff.

'It is always a sad time and it is very difficult for all of us, the staff, because he kept us here and we were part of his backroom staff.

'We're all disappointed but we have got to move on very quickly with this big game.'

Tim Sherwood has emerged as the early favourite to take over at Palace (6/4), with Chris Hughton (6/1) and former boss Pulis (7/1) shortly behind.

Former Eagles defender Tony Popovic, who is currently managing Western Sydney Wanderers in the Australian A League, has also been linked with the vacancy.
