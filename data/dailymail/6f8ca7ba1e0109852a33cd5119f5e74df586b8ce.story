Workers preparing a multi-million pound science centre have uncovered the remains of a Victorian club, where Friedrich Engels was a member.

A team digging at the Booth Street East site of the £61 million National Graphene Institute in Manchester have discovered the foundations of the Albert Club - which entertained the great and good across the city.

Engels is known to have become a member in 1842, when he was sent to Manchester to manage his father's textile factory.

Appalled by poverty and slum conditions, he went on to write the Communist Manifesto with his friend Karl Marx.

Friedrich Engels' time in Manchester inspired his future work

Archaeologists carrying out preparation 
work uncovered a row of cellars from 1830s terraced houses and the 
remains of the club, named after Prince Albert and frequented by 
middle-class Germans.

The team say they have always 
known the location of the gentleman's club underneath the site, 
previously known as Lawson Street.

But they were surprised by the surviving elements they were able to find, including fragments of ornate stone columns.

The Government-funded centre will be the new home to Sir Andre Geim and Sir Kostya Noveselov, the Manchester University academics who won the Nobel Prize for their work with graphene in 2004.

It will be built on land opposite the Manchester Aquatics centre.

Professor Novoselov has salvaged an intact sink which he hopes to use in the new building.

He said he was immensely proud that the centre would be built on the Industrial Revolution foundations.

He said: 'We have been very careful to record these remnants of the Industrial Revolution and we will look to keep some artefacts for use in the new building or elsewhere.

The dig uncovered steps and tiles from the 19th century club as well as cellars from 1830s terraced houses

Archaeologists also unearthed the cobbled streets of the area, formerly known as Lawson Street

'It is genuinely exciting to start work on such a significant research institute on such an important site.'

The archaeological team unearthed the cobbled streets as part of the building process for the new 7,600 sq m building.

Scientists hope the institute will put Britain at the forefront of research into the new material.

Diana Hampson, the university's director of estates, said: 'We have been advised that the remains we have uncovered are not hugely significant in archaeological terms, but are fascinating nonetheless.'

Engels, left, and Karl Marx, right, were the founding fathers of Marxism and close friends until Marx's death

Engels' two-year spell in Manchester proved to be hugely influential in his work.

Before the move, he had begun to read the work of philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and published articles about the poor conditions and pay for factory workers.

He was sent to manage the Ermen and Engels Victoria Mill in 1842 when he was 22 by his parents.

They thought the experience might drum his communist tendencies out of him - but were proved wrong.

On the back of his stint in Manchester and Salford, he wrote The Conditions of the Working Class in England in 1844, describing the appalling conditions of work and pay for the working class in the area and describing his thoughts on the emergence of socialism.

Engels met Karl Marx on his way to Britain and their working relationship began in 1844 after meeting again in Paris.

Their Communist Manifesto, published in 1848, was their third work together and is the second best-selling book of all time behind the Bible. After Marx's death, Engels continued to critique capitalism.

He also published his late friend's Capital II and Capital III and became hugely influential on emerging socialists.

Engels died in London in 1895 and his ashes were scattered off Beachy Head, East Sussex.
