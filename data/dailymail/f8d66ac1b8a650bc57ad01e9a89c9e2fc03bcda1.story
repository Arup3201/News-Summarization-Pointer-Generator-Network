Furious: Chief of Army Staff General Bikram Singh made his anger plain

Infuriated by the decapitation of a soldier by Pakistan army regulars on the Line of Control, army chief General Bikram Singh on Monday said the local commanders have been asked to hit back at the place and time of their choosing.

A fuming General speaking for India warned Pakistan: "We reserve the right to retaliate. We cannot be passive when provoked."

Top government sources said limited, localised military conflict with Pakistan was not ruled out. The Army has been put on high alert and Poonch, Rajouri and Uri sectors may see army retaliation.

On a day when Gen Bikram Singh talked tough, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj and assured them that the Opposition would be kept in the loop over the situation.

He told them that National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon would brief them tomorrow (Tuesday) on the developments.

In sync with the official line of action, an incensed General fumed: "I expect all my commanders on the Line of Control to be both aggressive and offensive in the face of provocation and fire. I don't expect my commanders to be timid."

The chilling warning was delivered by a combative army chief who termed the beheading of Lance Naik Hemraj of 13 Rajputana Rifles an "unpardonable" act completely against the ethics of soldiering. But he was not willing to raise the level of response at this moment as the General asserted that India's payback will be localised and tactical.

"General Bikram Singh has given a good message. He has spoken openly to nail Pakistan's propaganda. The statement was given after four-five days of the incident which means that all investigations have been completed and discussions have taken place. Today's response is not only of the military but also has a political aspect," said former army chief General V.P. Malik.

Another former army chief, General Shankar Roy Chowdhary, said: "Definitely there is no gap between the government and the army. Government now should take note of the feeling in the army."

Justifying General Bikram Singh's stand, Lt general (retired) Shankar Prasad said: "What army chief has said is the position of government of India. He is part of the government. It is a stand taken after going through the developments of the last four to five days. It is a good reaction from India."

Just as the General went public in a manner unusual for an Indian army chief, Pakistan was conveyed the sentiments on the grounds in equally uncertain terms during the flag meeting of brigade commanders held at Chakan Da Bagh in the Poonch sector.

The General's outburst was reflected in the flag meeting as Pakistan was bluntly warned to be prepared for retaliation. The Indian side was represented in the flag meeting by Brigadier MVS Kumar of the 120 Brigade. The Pakistani side remained in denial mode. They claimed that they had not intruded into Indian territory on the day the two jawans were killed.

When warned by the Indian side of escalation, the Pakistani side maintained complete silence on the issue. It is clear that the Pakistan army establishment is being blasé about this operation, but the Indian Army will no longer tolerate any misdemeanor or misconduct on the LoC.

India also asked for the severed head of Lance Naik Hemraj, even though Pakistan denied involvement in the killing.

General Bikram Singh was not willing to accept the denial. He slammed the Pakistani army for its blatant lie and claimed that the operation in the Mendhar sector was pre-meditated and executed with planning and after reconnaisance.

He denied any provocation from India as claimed by Pakistan army. The General said there was no operation by Indian Army on January 6 in Uri as alleged by Pakistan.

The Pakistani army was looking to justify the act on the basis of lies, said General Singh.

"Such operations require time and planning and detailed reconnaissance. They blamed us in Uri and their troops were poised for operation in Mendhar," he said.

He even claimed that the Indian army has reports about three Pakistan casualties in the firing that has been going on after the Mendhar incident.

The army chief's stern warning was in sharp contrast to the soft line taken by the government which was under attack for not nailing Pakistan. The army chief was officially given the signal to go all-out to convey India's anguish.

General Singh said clear direction has been given to the northern army commander to retaliate.

"At military level there is clear direction to northern army commander. We got to retaliate in a measured manner and for effect. We shall not be passive. We reserve the right to retaliate at the time of choosing. I expect commanders to be aggressive and assure that army hierarchy is standing behind them," said the army chief.

While looking to retaliate, India made it clear that it is not willing to up the ante and will reserve its response to the tactical level.

"Their operation was at tactical level. This goes on Line of Control. It has to be dealt with at tactical level," said the General, stressing the local commanders will plan when, where and how they have to retaliate.

He indicated that Udhampur-based 16 Corps, which commands the vulnerable section of the LoC where the most violations of ceasefire have taken place, will execute the hit-back plan.

Northern army commander Lt Gen KT Parnaik

For northern army commander Lt Gen K.T. 
Parnaik, retaliation for the January 8 incident, where two soldiers of 
his command were killed and decapitated, has a more personal meaning.

Lance Naik Hemraj and Lance Naik Sudhakar belonged to the 13 battalion 
of the Rajputana Rifles. Lt Gen Parnaik is the Colonel of the Raj Rif 
regiment. This is significant because regimental affiliations in the 
army are thicker than blood ties.

Lt Gen Parnaik visited the incident 
site on January 9 and confirmed the bodies had been mutilated. The GOC, 
described by army officers as spirited and articulate, was seething. It 
is not known what he told soldiers of his regiment, but army officers 
say he could not have spoken words of restraint.

The gruesome killing 
and the massive publicity it received have embarrassed the regiment.

"It
becomes extremely difficult to control troops in such situations, 
especially when they are along the Line of Control," an army officer 
said.

The colonel of the regiment is the only post in the Indian Army 
for which elections are held. A collegium of officers above the rank of 
colonel selects him from the regiment's senior-most officers.

The Raj 
Rif, as it is called, is the army's oldest rifle regiment. It has a 
400-year-old history, tracing its origins to the Bombay Sepoys raised by
the British East India Company in January 1775.

After days of being at the receiving end 
of the BJP's barbs for his 'silence' against Pakistan, Prime Minister 
Manmohan Singh reached out to the largest Opposition party on Monday.

Singh spoke to Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, the leaders of the 
Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament, briefing them on the 
situation in the Line of Control (LoC).

Briefing: The PMO confirmed that Sushma Swaraj will be briefed on the government's action plan

Sources in the Prime Minister's 
Office (PMO) said National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon will be 
briefing senior leaders of the BJP on Tuesday on the government's plan 
of action in response to the brutal murder of two Indian troops by 
Pakistani forces on January 8.

Sources said Singh told the leaders that 
nothing is being done which could not be communicated to the Opposition 
leaders. He said the Opposition would be kept in the loop over the 
situation.

"The prime minister's conversation with the two leaders was 
aimed at apprising them of the steps that are being taken. There is a 
perception in the Opposition that the government has not done enough. 
They believe the government is keeping things outside the public domain.
This is not the case. This is an issue of national security and the 
government is taking steps," a senior PMO official said.

The prime 
minister is also said to have tried to impress upon the BJP to stop 
politicising the issue by making provocative statements. While paying 
homage to one of the martyred soldiers, Lance Naik Hemraj, Swaraj 
exhorted the government to bring 10 heads from Pakistan if Hemraj's 
severed head wasn't returned.

"The Congress had fully supported Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and defence minister George Fernandes 
during the Kargil conflict; the BJP must reciprocate by showing the same
degree of bipartisanship in the present situation," a Congress leader 
said.

The late evening conversation between the PM and the two leaders, 
however, has set tongues wagging that the government might be 
considering a major step vis-à-vis Islamabad in the days to come.

The 
government's need to take decisive steps has been further necessitated 
by the aggressive posturing of the Congress party over the past few 
days.

Party spokesperson Rashid Alvi, who has been particularly 
vociferous in the entire episode, said: "India never was, isn't and will
never be a soft state.

"India would not like to see a war anywhere in 
the world but will not tolerate any humiliation to its soldiers... No 
eventuality can cow us down."

The beheading of Lance Naik Hemraj of 13 
Rajputana Rifles and mutilation of Lance Naik Sudhakar's body by 
Pakistan Army regulars on the LoC in the Mendhar sector was not a 
one-off incident.

The Indian Army has accepted that two incidents have 
taken place earlier - one in May 2000 and the other in July 2011. The 
incidents were hushed up even though they were talked about in the 
media.

While it showed that the Pakistan Army had broken the rules of 
engagement of civilised forces in the past as well, India had chosen to 
sweep them under the carpet, fearing the impact on the morale of the forces.

In 2000, a raid led by terrorist Illyas Kashmir at Ashok Listening Post 
killed seven Indian soldiers. One of them, Sepoy Bhausaheb Maruti 
Talekar, was beheaded.

In July 2011, the Pakistan Army beheaded two 
Indian soldiers of 20 Kumaon Regiment. The incident was denied by the 
Indian Army but the local police confirmed at the time of cremation 
that the jawans' heads were missing.
