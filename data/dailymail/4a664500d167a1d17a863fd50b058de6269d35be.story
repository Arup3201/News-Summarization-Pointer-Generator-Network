This is the latest in a series of works by British graffiti artist Banksy to be put up in New York as part of his 'residency' Better Out Than In

British graffiti artist Banksy's new work was nearly defaced within hours of being discovered in New York on Sunday.

The painting, which shows the silhouette of a child swinging a sledge hammer at a fire hydrant, appeared on the Upper West Side.

Rival graffiti artists, angered by a new presence on their 'turf', have raced to destroy the works, leading to some residents putting up metal shutters and plexiglass to protect them.

Several masked men tried to scrawl over the new work, but were apparently stopped by onlookers.

While hundreds of street art enthusiasts have welcomed the Bristol-born tagger to their city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he does not consider the work art and the illegal activity 'should not be permitted'.

The work is Banksy's 20th in the city, as he puts up one a day for his show entitled Better Out Than In.

Vandals have so far removed the doors and wheels from a car painted by Banksy, while other works have been painted over and pieces chipped from walls which have been 'tagged'. One rival was even unmasked and tackled by a security guard on camera after defacing a painting, though he escaped before police got there.

As well as his traditional graffiti, during his stay in the city Banksy has also set up a street stall in central Park selling original signed works for $60 each, despite being worth an estimated $30,000.

While lovers of Banksy flocked to take pictures with the new painting, others reportedly tried to deface it just hours after it was found

Only three shoppers bought eight canvasses between them, with others apparently unconvinced that the stencils were real.

His other works have included two paintings hung in an underpass in Chelsea, a car and wall painting depicting horses hunting men, and spray-painting the words 'the musical' after other slogans painted on walls.

Two trucks were also used as moving works of art, one featuring a 'living painting' set up inside which drove around the city, and another slaughterhouse van which had toy animal heads stuck out from between the slats.

It is the 20th artwork to be unveiled in the city as part of a month-long exhibition which has seen a new one appear every day

The 'art' has sharply divided opinions, with some property owners putting up shutters and screens to protect the works scrawled in their buildings, while Mayor Micheal Bloomburg said the activity 'should not be permitted'

Several attempts have been made to unmask the as-yet unidentified artist during his stay across the pond, with one determined follower attaching a tracking device to the slaughterhouse van, though a note on Banksy's website later revealed 'you're now following a car service in Queens' after the device was moved.

Another Twitter user posed pictures of three men packing away one of the vans in a Red Hook cap park, saying he had found Banksy because one of the men spoke with a British accent.

Since rising to fame during the early 2000s Banksy's work has appeared all over the world, from Paris to Palestine, and he has even made a film called Exit Through The Gift Shop.

Other art shows have attracted thousands of viewers including his first American show in LA in 2006, entitled The Elephant In The Room, which featured an actual painted elephant and attracted the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
