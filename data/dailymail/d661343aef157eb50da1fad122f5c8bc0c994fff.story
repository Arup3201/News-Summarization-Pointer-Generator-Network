Russian President Vladimir Putin oversees a country with an astounding 18million people living beneath the poverty line.

But it has emerged he can now toast his own success on the international stage - after planting a vineyard in the grounds of a stunning Spanish mansion he has reportedly bought and developed for some £15million.

Putin’s grand home near Marbella is in the Malaga province of Benahavis and comes complete with stunning northern views of the Serrania de Ronda mountain range.

Vladimir Putin’s grand home is on the exclusive La Zagaleta estate in the Malaga province of Benahavis (pictured) and boasts a private helipad and garage capable of housing more than 22 vehicles. He has planted the top Burgos-based Bodega 'Pingus', with single vintage bottles of the wine costing in excess of £750

Meanwhile, to the south the wealthy Russian leader can enjoy an unspoilt Andalusian outlook across the Mediterranean sea towards both Gibraltar and the coast of North Africa.

Putin – who has always revelled in his hard-man bare chested ‘hunter’ image – has clearly now decided he might enjoy the finer things in life.

For the Daily Mail has learned that the 62-year-old insisted on 25 vines from the top Burgos-based Bodega ‘Pingus’ – some 500 miles from the Costa del Sol - to be planted into a series of sun-soaked terraces surrounding his new mansion high in the Marbella Hills.

The Russian president, 62, will have the wine he produces stored in acclimatised cellars costing an estimated £750,000 to install.

The Russian President is understood to have hired the famous Valladolid province vineyard owner – Danish oenologist Peter Sisseck – to oversee both the production of the grapes and the later bottling process.

Putin's mansion is set on a plot of land totalling more than 18,000 square metres

Pingus is described as a ‘cult wine’ which can be sold at extremely high prices after the vines are cultivated without the use of either fertiliser or pesticides.

Single vintage bottles can demand prices in excess of £750.

Following a carefully controlled harvest, Putin’s version of the wine is set to be produced in two huge underground cellars at the ten-bedroom mansion he bought two years ago and which has since seen vast redevelopment.

Putin’s grand home is on the exclusive and gated La Zagaleta estate and boasts a private helipad and garage capable of housing more than 22 vehicles.

The wine he will produce would be stored in French oak barrels within two specially acclimatised cellars which cost an estimated £750,000 to install.

More than two years ago it was revealed that former KGB boss Putin was linked to a consortium of six wealthy businessmen helping to back and fund the wealthy Club de Campo La Zagaleta project.

President Putin’s Spanish home is just a forty minute drive to the newly refurbished Malaga airport which now offers direct flights to Moscow.

The extravagant residential estate has a plot of land totalling more than 18,000 square metres and is 400 metres above sea level and less than eight miles from the Costa beaches.

The ‘Club’ environment – including homes owned by the former Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov and a nearby property belonging to Rod Stewart – boasts a spa, two golf courses, a cinema, piano bar and a number of swimming pools.

As 18million Russians live below the poverty line - a staggering 13 per cent of the population - it remains unclear what they think about Putin's fine wine project (file picture)

The development also boasts several lounges, a billiard room, bowling alley and a function room for private events or discos. 

Members of the club can also take part in enjoying hiking and cycling trails on the development.

Promotional material for the development tells of members and their guests being offered a ‘high level of security, privacy and exclusivity’ with visitors enjoying luxury surroundings including the ‘mild climate of Southern Spain, the beach and the contrast of the mountainous landscape.’

The developers of the site have also lived by the mantra ‘only the best is good enough’.

But just what 18million poverty stricken Russians – a staggering 13 per cent of the population – think about Putin’s fine wine project remains unclear.
