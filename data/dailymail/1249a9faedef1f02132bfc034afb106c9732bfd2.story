Porto are showing an interest in Manchester United misfit Anderson. 

The 26-year-old is one of a host of players made available for transfer by new United boss Louis van Gaal.

And the Portugese giants are keen on striking a deal with the 20-times champions to bring the Brazilian back to the Estádio do Dragão after a two-year spell in the past.

Frustrating: Anderson has plenty of ability but has struggled with injuries while at Old Trafford

On his way? Could Anderson make a return to the club he was at before he joined United

Anderson has endured an injury-plagued spell at Old Trafford since joining seven years ago, making just eight appearance in all competitions for the Red Devils last season.

He then spent the second half of last season on loan at Serie A outfit Fiorentina, but failed to impress sufficiently.

Meanwhile, the likes of Maraoune Fellaini and Wilfried Zaha are others looking to be on their way out of Old Trafford.
