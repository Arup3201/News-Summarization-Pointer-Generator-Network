An Irish woman has become the first adult to undergo an operation to insert magnets in her back to combat a severe curvature of her spine.

Deirdre McDonnell, from Drogheda, County Louth, spent 30 years in pain after being diagnosed with scoliosis.

Surgeons performed the pioneering MAGEC rod operation on the 34-year-old, inserting magnetic rods into her spine.

The procedure, also known as the magnetic expansion control system, involves screwing the rods into the spine.

The rods can then be controlled externally in order to correct the curvature of the spine.

Up until now the £15,000 operation has only been performed on children, as it was only thought to be effective for early onset scoliosis - typically diagnosed before the age of 10.

Deirdre McDonnell, 34, from Drogheda, County Louth, is thought to be the first adult in the world to have a pioneering operation to insert magnetic rods in her spine to correct her scoliosis, left. Right, after surgery

The 34-year-old was diagnosed as a newborn and underwent her first operation when she was just six weeks old. The condition, which causes an abnormal curvature of the spine, caused Miss McDonnell's spine to bend in the shape of a 'C', curved at 130 degrees, left.

Following the success of Miss McDonnell's surgery, specialists are now hopeful the bone implant will help other adults, many of whom have undergone a number of unsuccessful and painful invasive operations in an attempt to straighten and lengthen their spine. 

'The operation has completely changed my life,' Miss McDonnell said. 'Before, I could only walk short distances without being in pain but now I love to walk everywhere.

'After more than 30 years of operations and taking painkillers, I'm finally hopeful for the future.' 

When she was just six weeks old, Miss McDonnell underwent her first operation.

She was diagnosed with congenital scoliosis, which affects around one in 10,000 newborn babies. 

Her spine was so malformed that doctors warned she wouldn't live past the age of seven. 

Over the next ten years, she underwent eight painful operations as doctors battled to save her life.

Beating the odds, Miss McDonnell survived childhood and trained at college to become a teacher. 

But the secondary effects of her scoliosis eventually left her unable to work.

She said: 'Because my spine was curved at 130 degrees, it formed into a C-shape and my lungs didn't have room to expand so they never grew to full size. 

'At my worst, my lungs were operating at only 30 per cent of what they should have been.

'This meant that I was constantly poorly with pneumonia and chest infections. Doctors said they didn't know what else they could do.

'Things got so bad that my doctor told me that if he didn't operate, I'd be dead within 10 years.'

Although MAGEC rod technology has existed since 2011, doctors initially didn't see it as an option for Miss McDonnell as it had previously only been performed on children.

However, after running out of options, doctors decided to operate.

Tallaght Hospital in Dublin was able to secure funding from the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the 34-year-old underwent the three-hour operation in June last year.

Over the following months, her spine was straightened at regular intervals.

Magnetic Expansion Control treatment is a way of straightening a curved spine.

It works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into a patients back.

This can then be controlled using an external control - this avoids the need for further surgery.

The internal rod is lengthened using the magnetic remote control outside the body.

This means the spine can be very gradually straightened.

Usually, the patient is required to return to hospital about every six weeks to have their spine straightened by a few more millimetres.

This process continues until the patient has reached their final height.

Until now the procedure has only be performed on children, with experts believing it would only be successful in those patients who are newly diagnosed with scoliosis. 

Now fully recovered, Miss McDonnell says she is looking forward to a healthy, happy future with her boyfriend, solicitor Robbie Slattery, 32.

'I'm no longer in pain, and I feel so much more confident in myself,' she said. 'Even little things like being able to wear pretty dresses or sit comfortably have made such a change.

'I feel so lucky to have been able to have this operation - it really has changed my life.

'Before my dad passed away in 2009, he told me that he hoped I'd one day get my dream of living a normal life. I just hope I'm making him proud.'

Consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Tallaght Hospital, Doctor Patrick Kiely, said: 'This is a big step forward for us.

'The largest benefit of MAGEC rod technology is that it removes the need for repeat operations.

'With the rod, once the initial procedure has been carried out, the patient doesn't have to undergo any more incisions. 

'The spine is straightened externally using a remote control, which is painless and is performed without anaesthesia. 

'This in turn minimises the risk of infection and limits the impact of the procedure on the patient.'

Scoliosis comes from the Greek word 'skoliosis' which means 'crooked'. 

Symptoms of the condition include a curved spine, prominent ribcage or shoulder blades and uneven arm and leg lengths.

She said: 'I'm no longer in pain, and I feel so much more confident in myself. I feel so lucky to have been able to have this operation - it really has changed my life'

It is estimated that 273 million people worldwide suffer from the condition, including Olympic runner Usain Bolt.

In the UK alone, approximately 45,000 children have scoliosis, with many having to undergo up to 20 corrective surgeries during their lifetime - at a massive £20,000 per procedure.

The MAGEC rod, which is manufactured in California by Ellipse Technologies, aims to not only change lives, but also cut costs by removing the need for repeat surgeries.

Vice president of Ellipse Technologies, Robert Martin, said: 'Magnetic rod technology has really revolutionised the treatment of scoliosis.

'Analysis shows that eliminating the need for repeat surgeries reduces cost dramatically.

'Thanks to the success of Deirdre's operation, we are hopeful that the operation will be performed on more adults and help to change their lives too.'

Laura Counsell, National Director of the Scoliosis Association and the British Scoliosis Research Foundation, added: 'To my knowledge, Deirdre is the first adult to have this operation.

'It's certainly a very innovative way of using technology that was originally designed for children between the ages of six and 11.'
