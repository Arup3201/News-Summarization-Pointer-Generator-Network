Father-of-two Raymond Lorne of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, texted the juror, whom he had known for 30 years, an anonymous threat as a 'joke'

A juror in a high-profile rape trial was left terrified when he received a text message reading: ‘I know who you are. If you find them guilty, I will find you.’

He did not recognise the number and called 999 to report the threat, fearing for his life and his family’s.

But days later, after a police investigation had been launched, it was revealed the menacing message had been sent by his friend as a ‘practical joke’.

Father-of-two Raymond Lorne of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, texted the juror, whom he had known for 30 years, after learning he could not be at their usual Thursday night pub quiz due to jury service.

He claimed to get the idea from the film of John Grisham’s novel Runaway Jury, a legal thriller.

The 40-year-old garden designer, who is married to a financial adviser, had been drinking and had forgotten he had recently changed his mobile phone number.

Lorne has now been jailed for 28 days after pleading guilty to being in contempt of court.

His friend received the text four days into a nine-day trial of Jason Britcher, 40 – a legal clerk who was accused of attempting to rape a junior barrister at a Christmas party.

The juror believed the message was connected to the court case as Mr Britcher had just given evidence saying he had sleepwalked into bed with the barrister and was innocent.

Later that night, the man called 999 and told police he was a juror on a case, did not recognise the number and was taking the threat seriously.

An officer was stationed at his home to protect him and his family while an investigation was launched on December 12.

Hull Crown Court heard that, when the number was traced, Lorne told police: ‘I sent the text. It was a practical joke.’

He said he had meant to ring his friend to explain the message, but after the pub quiz had forgotten.

Crown barrister John Thackray told the court that the jury in the rape case had had to be sent away, Britcher had been unable to speak to his barristers for three days and the juror had to be discharged for fear the stress could have influenced his decision.

Lorne was jailed for 28 days, after pleading guilty to being in contempt of court.

Defence barrister Nigel Clive said Lorne was a married businessman who did not fit the picture of a man accused of jury intimidation.

‘He and a friend were in a pub quiz,’ said Mr Clive. ‘He was told about his mutual friend who was on jury service. He took it upon himself to send the text... it was his phone... There was no venom or malice, but there was stupidity in abundance.

Hull Crown Court heard that, when the number was traced, Lorne told police: ‘I sent the text. It was a practical joke'. The judge said: 'The consequences of your extremely foolish action have been serious'

‘I have told him what will be at the forefront of your honour’s mind. The prospect of prison fills him with dread. He coaches a local football team which the juror’s son is in. Their friendship will recover.’

Sentencing Lorne, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told him: ‘This was a serious contempt of court in the middle of a difficult, sensitive high-profile case. As a measure of the serious nature of that case I have just sentenced the defendant to nine years in prison.

‘Your friend was serving on the jury in that case. The defendant had just completed his evidence in chief with his defence lawyer and was preparing himself to be cross-examined.

‘He could not talk to his lawyer. The case had to stop because of what you did. The defendant could not be told about the problem because no one knew initially what was going on.

‘A senior officer from Humberside Police had to be tasked to investigate, away from more important duties, until it was found out how serious the threat was.

'The consequences of your extremely foolish action have been serious. We lost one full day of trial. A juror on that trial was terrified.

‘That juror had to be protected by a police officer at his home until the threat was established. 

'People you know were terrified. The cross-examination had to be delayed. There was a three-day gap in [the defendant’s] evidence and he had that hanging over his head.

‘No one must be under any illusion sending a threatening text to a juror must mean you go to prison at once.’
