A young woman screams uncontrollably as a priest recites a passage from the bible in a final attempt to exorcise the devil which has possessed her for 15 years.

It sounds like something from a horror movie, but this sinister scene is from a new real life documentary that highlights the extraordinary work of one of Europe’s only Vatican-approved 'exorcists'.

Produced by Norwegian filmmaker Fredrik Horn Akselsen, the film entitled The Exorcist in the 21st Century follows Father José Antonio Fortea on his one man crusade to rid the world of demons.

Devil woman: Constanza, who claims to have been possessed by the devil screams as one of Europe's only Vatican-approved priests tries to 'free' her

The movie is released this month and the new trailer begins with the eerie sound of monks chanting as an anonymous, hooded figure wearing a long black robe mysteriously paces across the camera.

The mysterious man is Father Fortea who meets Constanza, a Colombian woman who claims to have been possessed by demons since 1997.

She says the Spanish exorcist is her last hope for 'spiritual liberation'.

Adding: ‘I know that Father Fortea is a very wise person who knows demonology and exorcism.

'I know that through Father Fortea I can be liberated completely.’

José Antonio Fortea is a Spanish priest who specialises in performing exorcisms.

Father Fortea is also an expert on demonology - the study of satanic forces - having written a number of studies and novels on the topic.

While any Catholic priest or even layman can perform an exorcism, certain priests are specially trained in the art.

Although exorcisms may seem old-fashioned, in fact they became much more popular during the 20th century.

The success of horror films such as 1973 hit The Exorcist is thought to have fuelled the demonic boom.

In disturbing scenes the woman is shown screaming: ‘Get away from me you damned Priest’ as the clergyman tries to exorcise the apparent demon within.

Father Fortea says: ‘Exorcism is a fight between all the forces of light against all the forces of demons.

‘The demon inside the person can call more demons to go there to help him.

‘And at the same time the minister of exorcism can call the saints, call the angels.

‘There is a battle with the weapons of prayer.

‘There are a small number of exorcists, there are a small number of miracles. We are the proof that the kingdom of heaven has arrived.'

The trailer has already attracted huge interest on the internet, but some are casting doubt on the authenticity of the film.

 the video on online sharing site Digg, Meredith Woerner writes: ‘Is 
this the real deal? You be the judge — either way the fervor on display 
here is pretty chilling.’

The film is director Akselsen's second documentary.

His debut film Treason and Sabotage premiered on Kosmorama International Film Festival in March 2010.

In addition to this, Akselsen is writing and directing three other projects, currently in development.
