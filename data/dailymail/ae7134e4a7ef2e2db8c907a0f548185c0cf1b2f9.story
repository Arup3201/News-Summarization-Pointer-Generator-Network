The legal team for George Zimmerman, accused of shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, has received a copy of the victim’s school records, documents which they said ‘could be relevant’ to the case.

‘We are entitled to receive the school records because some information in Martin's file could be relevant in the defense of George Zimmerman,’ the website for Zimmerman's legal defense stated Wednesday.

While the records from Miami-Dade, Florida, schools have not been made available to the public, portions could be revealed later, Zimmerman's legal team said.

‘We are entitled to receive the school records because some information in Martin's file could be relevant in the defense of George Zimmerman,’ the website for Zimmerman's legal defense stated Wednesday. (Zimmerman pictured left, Martin pictured right)

‘If any detail of the school records should be considered relevant in the course of a Self-Defense Immunity Hearing, only the parts deemed relevant to the case will be entered into evidence,’ the website stated.

That hearing is expected to happen in April.

State prosecutors and Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's parents, objected to releasing the records, saying they were irrelevant to the case, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Since Zimmerman did not know Martin before the shooting, the teen's past was not a factor in the case, Crump said.

The shooting took place on the night of February 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claims that Martin attacked him so he shot him once in the chest.

Moments before the shooting, Zimmerman had called the Sanford Police Department to report that he had spotted a young man in his neighborhood and thought his behavior seemed suspicious.

Police took Zimmerman in for questioning on the night he shot Martin and later released him with no charges.

But as news of the shooting spread nationally over the next couple weeks, calls for Zimmerman to be arrested and charged grew.

Then on March 13, just before the case was handed over the prosecutors, police made several changes to their final report on the shooting.

Around 9:40 a.m., their 10-page case summary recommended a second-degree murder charge and four hours later, they downgraded that charge to manslaughter.

They also added criticism of Zimmerman for assuming Martin was preparing to commit a crime.

'The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialogue in an effort to dispel each party's concern,' the report said.

'There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity at the time of the encounter.'

Around 2:30, another paragraph was added to the report that said a doctor's office had diagnosed Zimmerman with a fractured nose and scalp wound the day after the shooting.

In the last version, issued around 2:23 p.m., police added a final addition to the now-13-page case summary that noted Zimmerman had called Sanford police four other times since August to complain about suspicious young black men in his neighborhood.

Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder despite the police agency's downgrade to his recommended charges.

But defense attorneys are hoping to use the changed reports to help their case as it goes to trial on June 10. 

Zimmerman is currently free on $1 million bail.

On October 19 Circuit Judge Debra Nelson granted the order to release Martin's school records, saying that Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, was entitled to the information.

O'Mara apologized for the request but said he owed it to his client to look into Martin's past.

The defendant has maintained that he acted in self-defense, while prosecutors maintained  said Zimmerman profiled Martin, assuming he was about to commit a crime and began following him.

Crump said in October that releasing the victim’s school records would be wrong and could damage his legacy.

Zimmerman's legal team said the information would not ‘demonize’ the late teen.

‘A number of parties have expressed concern that we will use information found in the school records to "demonize" Martin,’ the website for Zimmerman's legal defense stated.
