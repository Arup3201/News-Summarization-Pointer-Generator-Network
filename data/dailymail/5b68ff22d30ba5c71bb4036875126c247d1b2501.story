A man who groped an 18-year-old girl's leg on a train was caught after she covertly snapped him on her mobile phone.

Raja Hussain, 39, from Rotherham, was given a suspended eight-month jail term after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a University of Sheffield student on a train in South Yorkshire.

He was arrested by the British Transport Police and taken to court after the photograph was released.

Raja Hussain, 39, from Rotherham, who sexually assaulted an 18-year-old girl on a train from Sheffield, was caught after she took this picture of him

The 18-year-old student was waiting for a train at Sheffield Midland station on October 29 last year when Hussain started 'grinning' at her, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Catherine Duffy, prosecuting, said that the victim felt 'intimidated' after Hussain sat down next to her and started looking at pictures of naked women on his mobile phone.

She said: 'The defendant was looking at pictures of naked women on his mobile phone. He moved closer to the complainant and began to take off his jacket. As he did so he touched her.'

The student edged away but his body remained in contact with hers and he touched her leg while 'grinning'.

She pretended to text a boyfriend to get Hussain to stop and also sent messages to her mother.

One read: 'I think this man is trying to stalk me, I actually feel sick.'

Miss Duffy added: 'As he got off the train in Rotherham she managed to take a picture of the defendant on her mobile phone.'

Police issued an appeal with the picture of Hussain and he was arrested.

Sarah Smith, defending, said there was no premeditation and Hussain was suffering from poor mental health at the time.

He had lost his 'highly respectable' job due to his mental health problems which included depression with psychotic features, hallucinations and delusional beliefs.

Judge Paul Watson QC, said: 'She is to be commended for the fact that she stuck to her guns and brought this to the attention of the authorities.

'People who randomly sexually assault members of the public must expect custodial sentences.

'What makes it serious is the element of fear this causes others.

'She was brave enough and alert enough to report you and give the police information which eventually led to your arrest and eventual plea of guilty.'

Hussain was also given an Asbo, banning him from trains for three years.

The train was travelling between Sheffield and Doncaster.
