Andrew Latham suffers from a syndrome that stops his brain from suppressing shock, causing his whole body to tense up

A father suffers from a rare neurological disorder which means he is literally scared stiff.

Andrew Latham has hyperekplexia, a neurological syndrome that stops his brain from suppressing shock.

As a result, his whole body tenses whenever he hears fireworks, dogs barking, or even someone coughing.

Mr Latham, 38, has suffered with the condition since birth. 

It also meant he was subjected to vile bullying at school - with classmates constantly making noises to make him jump.

He said: 'Dogs barking, people coughing, fireworks - basically anything unexpected - startles me and makes me jump.'

He must also be extra careful when going about his day-to-day errands, as even crossing the road can be a danger if he's startled by the sound of an engine or beeping horn. 

Despite this, he continues to support his local football team, Accrington Stanley, and can deal with the raucous noise in the stands.

'But when I'm watching the football I will stand there like anybody else. For some reason, when I'm watching the football, I will stand there like anyone else.'

Mr Latham's parents, Janice and Chris, said they knew something was wrong before their son was born.

His mother explained: 'When I was about seven months' pregnant I noticed in the womb that he just felt stiff. 

'When he was born, he would jump every time we tapped his incubator.' 

'Them when he started at school,  the children picked up that he jumped whenever the door shut in class. So then, as kids are, they would deliberately make noises whenever he was near. He was very unhappy.'

Doctors, however, remained baffled as to what was causing Mr Latham to be so jumpy.

His father said: 'We were seen by experts and psychologists. They really couldn't pinpoint what it was. 

'First they said it was cerebral palsy, but they ruled that out and then said it was a muscle problem.'

Mr Latham's condition, hyperekplexia, stops his brain from suppressing shock. It means that everyday noises such as a dog barking or someone coughing are particularly alarming for him

It wasn't until Mr Latham was 21 that he was finally diagnosed with hyperekplexia - a result of an abnormality in a particular gene in the brain.

His neurologist, Professor Kailash Bhatia of University College London Hospitals, explained: 'There are certain chemicals that are important for inhibition of the nervous system.

Hyperekplexia is a rare hereditary, neurological disorder that stops the brain from suppressing shock.

People with this disorder have an excessive startle reaction (eye blinking or body spasms) to sudden unexpected noise, movement, or touch.

Symptoms include extreme muscle tension  that prevents voluntary movement.

This means the affected person can fall stiffly - like a log - without loss of consciousness.

Exaggeration of reflexes and an unstable manner of walking may also occur.  

'When these chemicals are not present the brain is more responsive - it becomes more excitable.

'Therefore he would not be able to suppress noise that the rest of us could.'

However Mr Latham's case is unique, because as well as the 'jump' reflex, he also has skeletal deformities, slurred speech and movement problems.

Unfortunately there is no cure but medics have been able to control the condition with medication.

Today he lives with wife, Lynne, and son, Sam, in Accrington, Lancashire.

His wife said: 'When I first started going out with Andrew he used to carry a little fact sheet in his pocket about his condition so he could explain it.

'I just remember saying that, at the end of the day, he was just Andrew to me. When we married it was really the best day of my life.'

Six years later they had their son, Sam, who has not inherited his father's condition despite the risk being 50 per cent.

Mr Latham said: 'Watching my own son being born was incredible. It was the best experience I could ever have asked for.' 

He is now positive about the future and is now undergoing tests in the hope that medics will be able to help others in his situation.

He said: 'I wish there was just a lot more awareness for the general public to realise what I go through every day.'

Mr Latham's story appears in a new series of Body Bizarre, Thursday September 25, 9pm on TLC.
