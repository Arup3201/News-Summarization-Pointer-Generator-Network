Vince Cable has savaged David Cameron for demanding tougher controls on immigration, accusing the Prime Minister of behaving like Enoch Powell.

In an extraordinary attack, the Lib Dem Business Secretary claimed the Tories were speading ‘panic’ about immigration and compared their ‘populist policies’ to Mr Powell’s notorious ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech from the 1960s.

And in a bizarre attack on the public, he suggested voters were ‘schizophrenic’ because they wanted curbs on migration despite enjoying holidays abroad.

'Panics': Vince Cable, pictured yesterday, attacked Tory demands for greater immigration controls

New laws: A ban on EU migrants claiming out-of-work benefits from the moment they arrive in the UK is being rushed through Parliament ahead of the January 1 lifting of access restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals

Mr Cable’s comments threatened to 
reignite a major Coalition row over immigration ahead of an expected 
influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are lifted on
 January 1.

One Tory 
Cabinet minister said the Business Secretary was once again ‘spewing 
bile’ and suggested Mr Cable should resign if he ‘hates us so much’.

The
 controversy erupted as a major new report warned that Bulgarian and 
Romanian migrants could put  huge pressure on housing, schools and 
hospitals in Britain.

The 
study by the centre-Left Institute for Public Policy Research says the 
UK could see an increase in ‘anti-social behaviour’ such as ‘aggressive 
begging, rough sleeping and even criminality’ as a result of the new 
arrivals.

And it warns that the Prime Minister’s much heralded changes to benefits rules will make little or no difference.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday said it was right to ban new arrivals from claiming benefits for three months when they come to the UK.

But the Lib Dem leader made clear his party would not sanction any further curbs on migrants, saying: ‘This is where we draw the line.’

Mr Cable went far further, rounding on his Coalition colleagues with a venom that took senior Tories aback.

Accusing the Conservatives of inflaming public fear of foreigners, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that they were behaving like Mr Powell, who was sacked from the Tory frontbench in 1968 after warning that new arrivals would lead to social unrest.

The Business Secretary said Tory Home Secretary Theresa May’s desire to cap EU migrants at 75,000 a year was ‘illegal and impossible to implement’ and claimed Tory interventions are doing ‘a great deal of damage’ to Britain.

expansion of EU borders 

He said: ‘What’s happening here is that the Conservatives are in a bit of panic because of UKIP.

'Reacting the way they are, it’s not going to help them politically but it’s doing a great deal of damage.

‘We periodically get these immigration panics, I remember going back to Enoch Powell and ‘‘rivers of blood’’ and all that, and if you go back a century there were panics over Jewish immigrants.

‘The responsibility of politicians in this situation when people are getting anxious is to try to reassure them and give them facts and not panic and resort to populist measures that do harm.’

Mr Cable also attacked the Tories over ‘very severe’ public spending cuts, warning that the ‘social fabric’ of Britain is at risk.

Finally, he launched a bizarre attack on the public, saying their desire to block new arrivals contrasts with their own wish to travel abroad.

He said: ‘It was summarised for me in a debate I had on the doorstep recently. Somebody said they are so absolutely fed up with all of these immigrants coming into Britain, they’re going to go away and live in Spain.

‘There’s a lot of sort of schizophrenia about it. What we’ve got to stop is damaging policies that actually do harm.’

In The Sunday Times, Mr Clegg said immigration was ‘the biggest dividing line in politics today’ and plans for a cap were ‘arbitrary, pointless and distracting’.

He wrote: ‘Sticking a big no-entry sign on the cliffs of Dover may be politically popular, but at a huge economic cost. What would happen if tonight every European living in the UK boarded a ship or plane and went home?

'Are we really that keen to see the back of German lawyers, Dutch accountants or Finnish engineers? Do we want the NHS to fall over and the City of London to grind to a halt?’

Sources close to Mr Cameron sought to downplay the row, insisting it is right to ‘put in place more robust transitional controls’ on new arrivals and ‘to make sure people can come here to work but not just to claim benefits.’

Referring to Mr Cable’s Enoch Powell comments, the source added: ‘Vince is a member of the Government and supports government policy. The words he chooses to do that are up to him.’

But the Tory Cabinet minister told the Daily Mail: ‘Once again Vince Cable opens his mouth and spews bile. If he hates us so much, I don’t know why he doesn’t resign. We could then have a Business Secretary who has a clue how to help business.’

Seventy Tory MPs are threatening to rebel over a vote on whether transitional restrictions should be reintroduced in January.

Mr Cameron has resisted calls to face down the EU and extend the controls, despite opinion polls showing public support for such a move.

Tory minister Ken Clarke claimed fears that Britain will be inundated after restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian migration are lifted on January 1 are exaggerated.
