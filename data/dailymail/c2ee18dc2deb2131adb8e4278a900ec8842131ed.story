First the tortoise beat the hare and now it seems they can pack a mean punch too. 

Footage has emerged of this real-life ninja turtle defending its territory against cats who dare to sit on its lawn.

And as this video shows, it really does have turtle power.

Get off my land: The angry tortoise squares up to the cat to defend its territory

Despite being only a third of the size of his opponent, the furious tortoise charges at one cat with its mouth wide open and an angry look in its eye before giving him a nip on its tail.

As the cat tries to fight back, the tortoise, which is remarkably quick on his webbed feet, gives the feline the run around before chasing it off its turf.

It isn't too long before another moggy thinks he can take on the aggressive creature.

One flip and it could all be over. 

But this tortoise is having none of it and shows him who is boss. 

The amusing video was taken by Salvelio Mayer in his back garden in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

He uploaded the footage onto YouTube and the clip has had more than six million views

Mr Mayer said: 'Basically, we live next to a nature reserve in the centre of Port Elizabeth.

'We have a variety of strange and wonderful animals that visit our garden every now and then.

'One
of them is this tortoise and once it is in our garden it takes 
ownership of the entire space and tends to attack any intruder - be it a
neighbour's cat or my wife Louise sitting next to the pool.

'It also goes for the lawnmower thinking that it's a giant tortoise eating his grass.

'We haven't given the tortoise a name because it comes and goes from the park and I can't really tell how old it is.'
