Celebrity chef Matt Moran has leapt to the defence of Jamie Oliver who was blasted by the Victorian child commissioner for being a 'd***head' on Tuesday after he admitted he disciplined his daughter by feeding her one of the world's hottest chilis.

Oliver admitted on Monday that  when one of his four young children became unruly or disrespectful,  he would coat their sliced apple with a type of chili known as the Scotch bonnet - because 'you can't smack naughty kids'.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia to mark ShopSmall month, the ARIA owner Moran said: 'Look, I probably wouldn't do that. I've had some fun with my kids over the years. It's all in jest, all a bit of fun.

'No one's going to hurt their kid. I don't think Jamie went out there to make his kids suffer. Someone's taken it a bit too far.'

On Tuesday, Victoria's children's commissioner Bernie Geary blasted Oliver, calling him 'a d***head' and cruel' for disciplining his daughter by feeding her one of the world's hottest chilis. 

Scotch bonnets have a  rating on the Scoville scale, which measures chili heat, of 100,000 to 350,000, making them up to 140 times hotter than a normal chili pepper.

Speaking with Radio 3AW's Neil Mitchell, Mr Geary said, 'He's a d***head Neil. It's just not appropriate to use cruelty as a form of discipline.' Mr Geary went on to say that Oliver's chili trick was a form of 'child abuse'. 

'This bloke, he should realise the influence he has as a high-profile public figure and a high-profile father,' Mr Geary said.

'If he's joking it's not even appropriate because some parents and families might think it's a legitimate or alternative way of disciplining children. He's way off the planet as far as I'm concerned.'

Mr Geary was responding to Oliver's confession about how he disciplines his children, saying on Monday, 'I give them chillies for punishment. It is not very popular beating kids any more, it's not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper. So you need a few options.'

Oliver said he had once tricked his 12-year-old daughter into eating an ultra-hot Scotch Bonnet, much to the annoyance of his wife, Jools.

At the BBC Good Food Show, Oliver said: 'Poppy was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck. In my day I would have got a bit of a telling-off but you are not allowed to do that.

'Five minutes later she thought I had forgotten and I hadn't. She asked for an apple. I cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with Scotch Bonnet and it worked a treat. She ran up to mum and said, 'This is peppery'. I was in the corner laughing. [Jools] said to me, 'Don't you ever do that again'.'

Mr Geary, who is Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People, said Oliver's role as an educator made his actions even more troubling.

'He purports to be a teacher and a role model and works with children. If he worked in a school in Victoria they'd sack him,' he said. 

Given his struggle to impose order on daughters Poppy Honey Rosie, Daisy Boo Pamela, 11, and Petal Blossom Rainbow, five, and son Buddy Bear Maurice, four, perhaps it is no surprise Oliver is not keen to add to his family.

He revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea, saying: 'You know what she said last night? She is 40 in about ten days and I took her out and she goes, 'OK are we going to have another kid then?' I said, 'You what?'.

Between the preparation and the simmering family tensions, Christmas lunch is often a painful experience for many Australians. 

But there are ways you can make it easier, according to celebrity chef Matt Moran. 

He provided some of his top tips about how to prepare the perfect festive meal to mark ShopSmall month, a month-long campaign to encourage customers to buy from the nation's small businesses.

1. Prepare, prepare, prepare 

'To me, it's all about preparation,' Moran told Daily Mail Australia. In other words, spend some time getting your meal together before the big day. 

It will make your special day that much easier.  

'Have everything done, making stuff beforehand, so you're just basically cooking things in the morning.

'Your brandy custard should be done prior. Your Christmas pudding should already be done.' 

'The last thing you really want to do is be spending more time in the kitchen when you should be opening presents and having a lot of fun.'  

2. Too much is never enough 

One of the best things about Christmas meals is the days and days of leftovers it produces, Moran said. 

And you shouldn't be afraid of making too much food. 

'The great thing I love about a ham and a turkey is you are eating it for the next five days. To me, that's the festive season. I love that. 

'I love the fact I can (grab) some ham four days later and have it for breakfast. I can have turkey sandwiches three or four days after.'

3. Buy local produce - it tastes better 

Whatever you do, make sure you buy local, Moran said. 'There's nothing better than going into your local shop.'

'People want that one-on-one contact. The guy recognises you straight away - to me, that's just a nice feeling.'  

'It's about buying local, supporting your guy,' he said. That could from your local butcher, fishmonger or fruit and veg provider. 

'And it's Christmas, it's a festive time and you know if you buy local, it always tastes better too.'

4. Try something different

Yes, you look forward to sinking your teeth into a delicious slab of Christmas ham each year. It can stay on the table. 

But why not add a little extra something else to your meal? 

Moran told Daily Mail Australia you should take the opportunity to try something a little different this festive season. 

'Go to your local grower's markets, your local fruit and veg guy, go in there and ask ... what is actually good.

'Go down to your fishmarkets. You might find something a little bit different. You might find your local fishmonger might have some... Balmain bugs or some scampi.' 

5. If you want to chill out, go out

If the prospect of guests trashing your home gives you the sweats, there's the option of taking your meal somewhere else, Moran said.  

For the top chef, Christmas is a time of family and friends, and he keeps his restaurants closed for the day.

'We don't open Christmas Day and the reason why we don't is I spent many, many years as a young chef working Christmas Day. 

'I missed out on about a dozen of them. I just always have that in my mind... I don't want my staff to (miss out).'

'The woman wants another baby. So watch this space. But with all the power in my body we are not having another baby.'

He admitted, however, that Mrs Oliver usually wins the arguments at home – even about food.

He said: 'My wife loves a destroyed steak. I have been with her since I was 18 years old, how romantic, but it is hard to keep loving someone when they want a well-done steak. I have tried to tell her but she is a very single-minded, dominant woman.'

The couple – who have a combined wealth of £240million – met when they were 17. The chef drove to a cinema, but crashed the car. He has joked she started dating him out of pity as a result.

Mrs Oliver, a former model, has worked as her husband's PA and now designs children's clothing.

Jamie Oliver, who was named as a Special Achievement Honouree at the LOVIE awards last week, said his wife Jools has asked whether they can have another child - their fifth - but the chef has said no
