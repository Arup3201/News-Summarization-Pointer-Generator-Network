Hard times: Esther Rantzen, pictured, has said elderly people are 'discarded like rubbish' and thrown away

Coming home at the end of a busy day, Esther Rantzen puts the key into her front door and finds herself in a dark, empty flat.

There is nobody for her to make a cup of tea for, nobody to ask her about her day and nobody to sit on the sofa with to watch TV. It is for the TV presenter a lonely time and has been since her husband, Desmond Wilcox, passed away 13 years ago.

The 73-year-old, best known for presenting BBC television series That’s Life!, has admitted she has found it difficult to adapt to life on her own and knows she is not alone as yesterday she said older people are often treated like ‘discarded rubbish with a sell by date’.

And with Christmas approaching, Miss Rantzen is only too aware that this is the loneliest time for some of the UK’s 10 million people now over 65. With this in mind she is rolling out The Silver Line, a 24-hour helpline service aimed at elderly people who are struggling to cope with loneliness, nationally on Monday November 25.  

Talking about her decision to set up the service she said in a new interview with the Radio Times: ‘Recently I received a letter from Ellen, clearly a clever woman who has brought up a family and held a responsible job, and yet who feels that in her old age “my days are pointless and I’m a waste of space”.

‘Reading it, I felt a surge of anger. Something must be done to assure our older population that they are valued. We must reach out to them, link them back into their communities, and convince them that older people are a resource, a national treasure. There must be no sell-by date, no moment when older people become rubbish to be discarded, thrown away. Loneliness is, according to the Department of Health, as dangerous physically as smoking or obesity. Mentally and emotionally, it is utterly destructive.

‘This is the generation that does not readily ask for help. They don’t want to be a burden. Loneliness is a creeping enemy, it isolates, erodes confidence, until it becomes more and more difficult to step outside the front door.’

Miss Rantzen’s late husband, documentary-maker Mr Wilcox, died from heart disease in 2000. Their relationship began as an affair in 1968, when he was her head of department at the BBC. They married in 1977 and spent 30 years together until his death, aged 69, and had three children together.

However, the presenter has been living on her own for the past two years after her youngest child Joshua, now 32, moved out. She sold the family home and now lives in a two bedroom flat in London.

It was earlier this year that Miss Rantzen spoke of her own sadness at being a widow, saying she would give up a decade of her life to spend just ten more minutes by her late husband’s side.

Miss Rantzen has also revealed she had 
even once pleaded with her daughter Emily, 34, to move back in with her 
in a bid to help her overcome her loneliness. However, she admitted it 
never happened, adding ‘What was I thinking? She’s a young woman who 
values her independence and has every right to live by herself.’

For Miss Rantzen loneliness is linked with loss, she states in her Radio Times piece: ‘The loss of a partner, of a job, of a neighbourhood, of friends.  ‘Some people are alone all their lives and never feel it. But Bob wrote to me: “I have just said goodbye to my wife who died of Alzheimer’s. It’s 65 years since we married, but more to the point, 72 since we first kissed. And she waited for me throughout the war, and I for her. Loneliness… tell me about it.”'

Having successfully set up the 
ChildLine telephone service, Miss Rantzen knew providing a similar 
service for the eldery would prove just as invaluable.

She
said: ‘ChildLine has shown that a helpline that’s free, safe and 
confidential can transform lives. Over the last 27 years, 3.2 million 
children have rung 0800 1111 and found the support and comfort they 
desperately needed. Now we are launching a helpline for older people, 
The Silver Line. We have been running a pilot service for the past year,
funded by Comic Relief. It has already transformed lives. As one 
gentleman told us, “When I put the telephone down, I feel like I belong 
to the human race.”

The Silver Line has been running as a pilot for a year but will now be available nationally. Callers will be provided with information, friendship and advice linking them with projects in their communities.

Volunteers will also be trained up to become   Silver Line Friends, making regular calls to older people to talk, discuss their hopes and dreams, pick over the news and share views.

Miss Rantzen added: ‘Our hope for the future is that The Silver Line will find its place in enriching older people’s lives, and counteracting loneliness, the most terrible poverty of all.’

Pensioners need to realise there is more to life than having a nice garden, an expert on ageing said yesterday. Tom Kirkwood, of Newcastle University, said that society was sidelining the elderly, leading to a ‘criminal waste’ of their knowledge and experience.

But retirees who settle for ‘tending the roses’ also have to shoulder some responsibility. He said: ‘This is a massive personal resource that is being parked in the potting shed, or wherever.’
