It’s been a crucial topic hanging over the Republican presidential debate so far - and there’s already a twist.

Texas Governor Rick Perry, 61, claimed last night he was ‘lobbied’ by a cervical cancer sufferer to require young girls to receive the HPV vaccine.

But it turns out according to ABC News he only met Heather Burcham after launching an executive order in February 2007 - which ultimately failed.

Mr Perry and Houston schoolteacher Ms Burcham, 31, became unlikely friends over his support of the human papillomavirus vaccine.

A spokesman for Governor Perry defended his comments on Friday as '100 per cent accurate'.

'The anti-cancer HPV vaccine requirement was never implemented in Texas,' the spokesman told MailOnline. 'The issue was hotly debated in 2007.

'Governor Perry met Heather during 
HPV legislative debates after the executive order was issued. She 
lobbied the legislature and Governor in favour of the anti-cancer 
vaccine.

'Ultimately, lawmakers overturned the executive order and Governor Perry allowed (a bill that overturned the order) to become law.

'Governor Perry and Heather established a friendship and stayed in contact until her death from cervical cancer.'

He said at Thursday night’s GOP 
debate that he spent lots of time with Ms Burcham, who had stage four 
cervical cancer and died in July 2007.

‘I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage four cervical cancer,’ Mr Perry said, reported ABC News.

But since she died he changed his mind on the HPV vaccine and sided against it with GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann.

‘I readily admitted we should have had
an opt-in but I don’t know what part of opt out most parents don’t 
get,’ he said at the Florida debate.

‘The fact is I erred on the side of 
life and I will always err on the side of life as a Governor (and) as a 
President of the United States.’

Ms Burcham was reportedly actually lobbying the 
Texas legislature to uphold Governor Perry’s order after he had issued 
it - rather than before.

He wanted sixth-grade girls to receive
the HPV vaccine, but he was ruled against by the legislature and gave up on the mandate, reported ABC.

Sufferer: Heather Burcham, who died from cervical cancer in 2007, bonded with Mr Perry over a campaign to make the HPV vaccine mandatory

Emotional plea: In an interview with ABC News before she died, Ms Burcham begged parents to do their own research into cervical cancer

Governor Perry often refers to Ms Burcham in public speeches and spoke at her memorial service in July 2007, reported ABC.

‘Though some could not see the 
benefits of the HPV vaccine through the prism of politics, some day they
will,’ he said in July 2007.

Minnesota Representative Mrs Bachmann believes giving the vaccine will encourage promiscuity and even 'mental retardation'.

Cervical cancer kills around 3,700 
women in the U.S. each year, but Mr Perry now calls his support of the 
HPV vaccine 'a mistake'.
