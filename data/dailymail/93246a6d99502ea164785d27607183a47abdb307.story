For anyone who has headed to Sochi, taking pictures to capture the action is a must - some may even want to take a 'selfie' proving they were there.

But this elderly woman appeared to get the wrong end of the stick (or camera) when attempting to take a photograph of an ice hockey match, only to take one of her own eye.

The woman was at the Bolshoy Ice Dome for the first round match between Russia and Slovenia when the slip-up took place, when she mistakenly turned the digital camera the wrong way round.

An ice hockey spectator at this year's Winter Olympics was caught on Russian television accidentally taking a picture of her own eye with a digital camera

And rather than capturing the game, she accidentally snapped her eye.

The comical image shows the close-up image of her eye on the preview screen of the digital camera.

To make matters worse, the accident was broadcast live on Russian television.

Since the game on February 13, it has rapidly become one of the most talked-about pictures of the games.

American Twitter user Bryan Wood spotted the picture and tweeted it.

Under his tweet, he wrote: 'A woman attempting to take a 
picture at a hockey game in Sochi today. This may be one of my favorite 
pics ever.'

Rather than mocking the image, he then wrote: 'I actually think itâ€™s cute.

'I will get old & do those things. I will laugh at myself 'cuz I have a sense of humor.'

Since it was first published the image has gone viral - gaining more than 33,000 retweets and 21,000 favourites.

Numerous users picked up on the tweet - with many responding in sympathy to the mistake.

Carrie Doll said: 'I can relate. My 3 year old is better at taking pix and selfies than I am!'
