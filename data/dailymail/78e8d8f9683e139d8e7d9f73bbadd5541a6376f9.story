Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams claims there is no reason to 'panic' over the use of the niqab

Primary school teachers should be allowed to wear Muslim veils in the classroom, according to the former Archbishop of Canterbury.

Rowan Williams claims that there is no reason to ‘panic’ over the use of the niqab and that even young children do not necessarily need to be able to see their teacher’s face.

Speaking in an interview for the Christian think-tank Theos he argued that there fears over how such a practise might affect children’s learning were ‘misplaced.’

He said: ‘I’ve actually been in public discussions in Pakistan with women wearing full face veil, and you learn to read differently, it’s not that those codes don’t happen … but there’s a cultural obstacle to overcome.

‘As a matter of fact I think that’s largely a misplaced anxiety, but I can see where it comes from.’

His comments are set to reignite the row over the role of the controversial full-face veil in public life which have rumbled on for years.

Last year Home Office minster Jeremy Browne called for a national discussion about their use in some settings such as schools, fearing that young women in some Islamic faith schools might have the veil imposed on them against their will.

David Cameron rejected the idea of a ban but said he would ‘back up’ schools and courts that ask women to remove veils.

The row continued when it emerged that a number of NHS hospitals had secretly banned female staff from covering their faces, followed by an admission from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that he would not personally want to be treated by someone wearing a veil.

In January this year, Rebekah Dawson, 22, made legal history by becoming the first woman allowed to go on trial wearing a veil.

A judge initially allowed the jobless Muslim fanatic to wear her niqab during her six-day trial for witness intimidation after ruling that the court should recognise ‘freedom of religious expression’.

But when the jury were discharged after failing to reach a verdict Miss Dawson admitted the charges – to the fury of many groups who accused her of making a mockery of British justice.

The issue re-surfaced again this summer when a top London state school banned a 16-year-old student from starting her A levels unless she removed her niqab. Camden School for Girls is famous for its liberal approach to education.

But despite a petition from more than 700 friends and fellow pupils it ruled that students wearing the traditional face-covering breached its ‘appearance policy’, which stipulates that students’ dress must allow teachers to interact with them.

In 2008 Lord Williams caused widespread fury with his suggestion that it would be unavoidable for some aspects of Sharia law be adopted in the UK.
