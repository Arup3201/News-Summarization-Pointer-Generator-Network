Former Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger has agreed to pay a £5,000 fine - the equivalent of 216 minutes' work - instead of completing community service because he is too busy searching for a new club.

Ex-Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger, pictured outside Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court last Tuesday, has agreed to pay a £5,000 fine rather than complete community service because he is too busy finding a new club.

The 22-year-old, was ordered to complete 120 hours of community service and nine months supervision by Newcastle Magistrates after admitting common assault in April.

Ranger - who was released by Newcastle in March where he was paid £7,000 a day - said he keeps missing probation meetings because he is touring the country meeting football chiefs and agents.

Highbury Corner Magistrates have agreed to change it to a £5,000 fine because Ranger is desperately scouring the country for a club that will take him.

He follows in the footsteps of fellow striker Carlos Tevez, who paid a £3,000 fine instead of doing community service for a driving conviction because he was moving from Manchester City to Juventus.

Ranger - who now earns £30 a day - skipped more than half of the court-ordered appointments and completed just 14 hours community service since he was sentenced in April, the court heard.

Ranger attacked his then-girlfriend Shakira Bicar in Newcastle city centre, pulling her hair during a row in the street.

He was hauled back into the dock last week after missing two appointments in July without giving any reason at all for his absence.

'After the imposition of the order, the defendant had a total of 29 appointments, out of which he managed to attend 13', prosecutor Mahmudul Amin told magistrates.

'Eight have been for the supervision requirement, and five for the unpaid work requirement. He has been credited with 14 hours' work.

'He also had 13 acceptable absences - the high number of acceptable absences is because Mr Ranger is a professional footballer.

'He was previously a professional in Newcastle playing Premiership football for Newcastle United, but his contract was terminated in March this year.

'Some of the acceptable absences are on dates of appointments Mr Ranger had with football agents.

'He has been traveling to different towns in England in order to try to secure a contract.'

Mr Amin said the heavily tattooed striker, who recently had his own surname inscribed on his forehead, breached the court order when he thought a new club had come in to sign him.

He said: 'In July this year, there was a suggestion he had secured a contract with a football club, however, the club did not tell him when he should start playing football.'

Alistair McKenzie, for Ranger, suggested the striker would pay a hefty fine, but is currently living off just £30-a-day from Newcastle under the terms of his release.

His disposable income is £210 a week and he doesn't have access to any other savings for the purpose of these proceedings', he said.

'When he left Newcastle in March, payment was made and he receives £30-a-day living expenses.

'He doesn't have outgoings in that, all his outgoings like accommodation has already been dealt with as part of that contract.'

The striker was on £7,000-a-week at Newcastle, but much of it was paid into a savings account Ranger is not allowed to access until he is 25 because he had a long-standing gambling addiction.

'The money in an ISA is part of a previous financial arrangement, and the reason he can't get to the money is probably due to his gambling issues he had at the time', said Mr McKenzie.

Ranger, a former England under-19 international, started his career in the Crystal Palace academy, before making the switch to Newcastle in July 2008.

But he failed to make the grade on Teesside, managing just three goals in 62 appearances before being released.

His career has also been dogged by controversy, including being forced into a grovelling apology after being pictured holding a gun in May 2011.

Manager Alan Pardew repeatedly complained about Ranger's inability to turn up on time for training, resulting in a temporary banishment to the reserves.

Ranger was fined £6,000 by The FA in March last year for making string of homophobic comments on Twitter, and he attracted criticism for posting a picture of his name spelled out in £20 notes earlier this year.

Mr McKenzie said Ranger's agent, who sat at the back of court, is hopeful a club will sign the striker before the end of the summer transfer window, on a contract worth around £3,000-a-week.

Magistrate Hazel Miall, chairing the hearing, accepted Ranger's bid for the sentence to be changed to a fine.

She gave him 42 days to pay up, or come back to the court if he has failed to find a new club in that time.

Ranger, of Bailey Close, Bounds Green, north London, admitted failing to comply with the requirements of a community order.

He was fined £5,000, ordered to pay £80 costs and a £120 victim surcharge.
