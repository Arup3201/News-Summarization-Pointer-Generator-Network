A 26-year-old woman has been charged with driving under the influence after she was arrested wearing ‘zombie’ contact lenses and dressed as a ‘pig in a nude color bathing suit’ for Halloween.

Kristine Gagnier from Orlando, Florida, was pulled over just before 2 a.m. last Friday morning after she was spotted driving her Chevy Cavalier erratically.

The wakeskater failed a sobriety test and was taken to the Orange County DUI Center, by Deputy Jeff Lotter.

Kristine Gagnier was found to have a blood-alcohol level of .120 when arrested in the early hours of Friday morning

‘While behind the vehicle I observed it leave the travel lane to the right, crossing over the fog line, and then over the lane divider line to the left, and then over the lane divider line to the right,’ said Lotter in his report.

Shortly after 3 a.m. Gagnier had a breath test and her blood-alcohol level was found to be 15 times the state limit. Gagnier had a blood-alcohol level of .120, while the limit for Florida drivers is .08, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

The deputy noted ‘several indicators that lead me to believe that Gagnier was impaired,’ including an alcohol odor, red eyes, slurred speech and an ‘admittance to drinking,’ the report said.

Wakeskating is a water sport and an adaptation of wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board.
