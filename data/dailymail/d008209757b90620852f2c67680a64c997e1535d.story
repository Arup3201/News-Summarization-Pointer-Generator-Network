Just last week, she was believed to have been stripped of her benefits.

But the disappointment has not stopped White Dee showing off her cash - and looking very happy about it.

The Benefits Street star made an appearance at Birmingham Pride, appearing a little sunburnt from her recent holiday to Magaluf.

Still on a high from her recent trip to Magaluf, she laughs on stage with a sunburnt chest

White Dee made her appearance today at the Birmingham Pride 2014 festival, which has been taking place this weekend

Wearing sunglasses and sporting a rosy chest, she posed for a number of photographs with fans at the festival, which takes place over the weekend.

The mother-of-two then walked on stage to announce the acts and hand out t-shirts.

She sported a lanyard with a pass on it which said 'artist' as she took to the stage and joined a line-up with names such as White Dee and Gabrielle.

Her agent, Barry Tomes, told Mail Online: 'She is here to have a good time and a bit of a party after a tough week.'

He also revealed that he is due to meet the Department for Work and Pensions this week about concerns over her benefit payments.

The DWP has reportedly frozen the reality TV star's £101 a week sickness benefit after she started cashing in on her growing celebrity status.

Mr Tomes said she is still signed on, but could not confirm whether she was still being paid.

She angered taxpayers recently when she was pictured on a jolly to the Spanish island where she was she seen downing pints, shots and champagne.

The 42-year-old had defiantly insisted ‘I’m not doing anything wrong’ and 
said she would continue taking state handouts until the Prime Minister 
or the Government stops her.

The
 mother-of-two, real name Deirdre Kelly, has repeatedly claimed that she
 is too depressed to work and her Magaluf trip was a pick-me-up for 
which she was not paid.

Recently she said: ‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron.'

Her
last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – 
and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000.

Following
the popularity of Benefits Street, which followed the lives of families 
on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six 
offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France.

She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and has been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham.
