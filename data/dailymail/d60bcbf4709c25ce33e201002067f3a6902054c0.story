A relative of al-Qaeda fantatic Mohammed Merah has said he is 'very proud' his brother for killing seven people, including three children.

Abdelkader Merah, 29, who was arrested over alleged terror offences told police he was 'very proud of my brother. I regret nothing for him and approve of what he did.'

Police are trying to determine whether the 24-year-old acted alone or had any help in carrying out the murders, which shocked France.

Merah's brother, Abdelkader, was flown to Paris for further questioning, along with his girlfriend, but a lawyer for Merah's mother, 55-year-old Zoulika Aziri, said she had been released without charge.

Jean-Yves Gougnaud told reporters in the southern French city of Toulouse that Aziri's world had been 'turned upside down.'

'She is devastated,' he told reporters after her release. 'At no time could she have imagined that her son was the one who did it.'

Merah, who claimed allegiance to al-Qaeda, died in a hail of gunfire on Thursday after a dramatic 32-hour standoff with police at his apartment in Toulouse.

At one point, police brought his mother to the scene, but she refused to urge her son to surrender, officials said.

Merah had filmed himself carrying out attacks in southern France that began March 11 and killed three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi and three French paratroopers with close-range shots to the head, prosecutors say.

Injured officers are being taken away on stretchers. Merah was corned in his flat and shot dead on Thursday

Another Jewish student and a paratrooper were wounded, and five police officers were injured trying to dislodge Merah from the apartment.

The pregnant girlfriend of a French soldier killed in a dramatic gun rampage will marry her partner in a posthumous ceremony, a family lawyer says.

Lawyer Gilbert Collard says that 21-year-old Caroline Monet will marry Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead at a cash machine in the town of Montauban near Toulouse earlier this month.

The 25-year-old soldier was one of seven people allegedly gunned down by Merah.

Collard says Monet has received preliminary approval from the president's office for the ceremony.

Such ceremonies are unusual but not unheard of in France, where the law allow posthumous marriages in cases where a fiance dies before the wedding.

The law states that such weddings can only be approved by the French president 'in grave circumstances'.

'I've already had it done twice, for policemen's girlfriends,' Collard said. 'It's a really moving ceremony, with an empty chair representing the dead spouse.'

Collard said the official request was being sent today, but that he'd already received the nod from the French president's office.

'There won't be any problems,' Collard said, adding that he hopes the ceremony will 'let the child have a father'.

Investigators are trying to figure out whether Merah, a Frenchman of Algerian descent, acted alone.

Key questions include how Merah, described by French intelligence boss Ange Mancini as 'a little failure from the suburbs', was able to amass an arsenal of weapons - including an Uzi sub-machinegun - and rent a car, despite having no clear source of income.

Mr Mancini told French broadcaster BFMTV that Merah told police during the siege that he bought the weapons for 20,000 euros, using money he acquired through break-ins and holdups.

He said he believed that Merah was telling the truth about that, but suggested that forensic police would be examining the guns for clues as to where Merah got them. 'The weapons, too, will talk,' Mr Mancini said.

Merah had claimed that neither his 
mother nor his brother knew of his plans, but police union spokesman 
Christophe Crepin told reporters that detectives have already gathered 
evidence to suggest that Abdelkader may have helped his brother carry 
out the shootings.

Asked what police had on the brother, Mr
 Crepin said there was evidence to suggest that Abdelkader had 
'furnished means [and] worked as an accomplice.'

Mr Crepin refused to comment further,
 saying it was for a judge to decide what charges, if any, to bring. 
Under French law if either of the two continue to be held beyond the 
weekend, preliminary charges will have to be filed.

Abdelkader had already come under 
police radar, according to officials. He was questioned several years 
ago about alleged links to a network sending Toulouse-area youths to 
Iraq, but no action was brought against him at the time.

Merah was gunned down by special forces police on Thursday after three separate attacks which saw four die at a Jewish school, along with three soldiers from ethnic minorities who had fought in Afghanistan

High alert: French police surrounded Merah's flat for 32 hours as he refused to surrender

Back in the southern French city of Toulouse, where Merah held out in an apartment building for more than a day against one of France's most elite police units, residents were beginning to return home to inspect the damage.

Video footage shot by police of the inside of Merah's apartment showed a shattered three-room residence strewn with debris from the fighting and gaping bullet holes in the walls.

Building resident Farida Bohama was quoted by France's Le Figaro newspaper as saying nothing would ever be the same. 'I really want to move,' she said.

Meanwhile pictures have emerged of injured police officers being brought out of Thursday's raid in Toulouse in which Merah was shot dead.

Four police were wounded in the 32-hour siege and one was shown being stretched away.

An English teacher has sparked outrage across France yesterday after calling for her pupils to observe a minute’s silence for Merah.

In disturbing scenes at Gustave Flaubert High School in Rouen, Normandy, Lorraine Collin, 56, described the terrorist as being the ‘victim of an unhappy childhood’.

This prompted up to 15 pupils aged between 17 and 18 to storm out of their classroom and report Ms Collin to their headmaster.

Luc Chatel, France’s Education Minister, called for Ms Collin to be ‘suspended immediately’, saying he ‘condemned this unspeakable behaviour without reservation’.Ms Collin drew attention to the fact that Merah was from a disadvantaged French-Algerian immigrant background and had been drawn to Islamic extremism while serving a prison sentence.

Merah said he had shot three youngsters at the Jewish school in Toulouse on Monday in revenge for Palestinian children killed by the Israeli Army.

Referring to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Ms Collin even said that Merah’s links with Al-Qaeda had been ‘invented by the media and Sarko.’

It was only when her students began to leave, or to argue with her, that she appeared to back down, saying she was ‘not feeling too well and perhaps take some time off.’

Ms Collin’s comments were soon afterwards reported by the Paris Normandie news website, who quoted an unnamed parent saying: ‘The students acted as responsible citizens by leaving the classroom. They hope the teacher will be suspended.

‘Otherwise, I will give permission for my daughter to boycott English classes until the end of the year.’

A spokesman for the school said what happened was a ‘sad incident’, and that a disciplinary procedure was underway.

Among rising concerns that extremists like Merah could threaten countries like Britain, European security officials warned of a Jidhadist threat which was becoming harder to track down.

Europol chief Rob Wainwright saod: ‘We have a different kind of jihadist threat emerging and it's getting stronger. It is much more decentralized and harder to track.’

Meanwhile hundreds of people participated in a minute of silence to pay tribute to the victims of the Toulouse school and three French soldiers, at the Capitol square in Toulouse, France.
