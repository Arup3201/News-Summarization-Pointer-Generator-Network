 A Japanese judge has ordered Google to remove search results of a man's unflattering past in a new 'right to be forgotten' order following a landmark ruling in Europe.

The Tokyo District Court yesterday ordered Google Japan to remove search results  that hinted at the man's relations with a criminal organisation after he complained his privacy rights were violated.

Google spokesman Taj Meadows said the company has a standard process for removal requests, and people can come to Google.

A Japanese judge has ordered Google to remove search results of a man's unflattering past in a new 'right to be forgotten' order following a landmark ruling in Europe in May

It is unclear whether the case would prompt further requests for information to be removed in Japan

He said: 'We remove pages from our search results when required by local law, including Japan's longstanding privacy and defamation laws.'

Google was reviewing the Tokyo court decision, Mr Meadows said. 

It is unclear whether the case would prompt further requests for information to be removed from websites in Japan. 

In the court decision, Judge Nobuyuki Seki said some of the search results 'infringe personal rights,' and had harmed the plaintiff.

The case comes on the back of a decision by the European Court of Justice in May that ruled Google should delete references to negative past information, including old debts and past arrests, to protect what has come to be called 'the right to be forgotten'.

While the European ruling has no baring on privacy cases in Japan it is a further blow against freedom of speech and a sign of increasing moves by the courts and legislators to allow people to censor their past. 

In America where Google and other Internet giants are based, the decision has no effect and experts say it is in conflict with the US constitution's first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech.

Examples of its use in the UK have already included hundreds of pedophiles applying to have their criminal pasts erased online. 

Within a month of the ruling coming into effect, over 12,000 people across Europe used an online Google form to request information about them be deleted. More than 10 per cent of the requests came from pedophiles. 

At one point Google said it was getting 20 requests per minute. 

The difference between Europe and the US means that results are deleted from local versions of google but not google.com. 

One man's attempt to have his debts kept secret has led to the 'right to forget' - which now seems to be spreading around the world. 

Mario Costeja González battle began in 2009 when he found a Google search of his name brought up an article in a Spanish newspaper from 1998 about an auction for his foreclosed home, and a debt he had subsequently paid. 

He initially complained to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, which rejected his request on the grounds the information was lawful and accurate. However, it asked Google to remove it. 

The company then challenged the matter in the Spanish courts before a ruling was made by the European Court of Justice.

The decision was widely criticised. German professor Niko Harting said:'Privacy by default will encourage politicians, celebrities and other public figures to put their lawyers on track when they find inconvenient information online.'

The impact of the ruling on Freedom of Speech, was highlighted by the removal from Google search listings of a blog Robert Peston, the BBC's respected economics editor, wrote in 2007 about Stan O'Neal, the former boss of investment bank Merrill Lynch, and how he was forced out of his job after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made.

In fact the removal was because one person no longer wanted a comment they had made on the blog associated with their name - emphasising that the 'right' went far beyond 'forgetting' the distant past.

In May the European Court of Justice ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the internet Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17. 

 Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data'. 

European citizens can submit take-down requests directly to internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress from the courts.

Following the decision, thousands of pedophiles and others criminals sought to have their criminals pasts erased from the internet.

All requests are considered by Google, but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest, and the company has said it will not remove links in all cases. 

The risk which the ruling poses to a free press and free discussion of ideas has been repeatedly highlighted, particularly by news websites, among them MailOnline.  

MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke said of the European Court of Justice decision: 'It is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don't like.'
