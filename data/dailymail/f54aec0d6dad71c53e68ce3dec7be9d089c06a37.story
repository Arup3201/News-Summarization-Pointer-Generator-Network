Unlawfully killed: A coroner has returned a verdict over the death of vulnerable pensioner David Askew following years of torment by yobs

A vulnerable man of 64 who collapsed and died after three decades of harassment by yobs was unlawfully killed, a coroner ruled yesterday.

David Askew, who had learning difficulties, had a fatal heart attack after confronting some of the local youths who had subjected him to years of mockery and vandalism.

No one has ever been prosecuted over his death, but yesterday coroner John Pollard said he had no doubt Mr Askew had been unlawfully killed.

He said the case showed how 'feral youths can bring misery to a decent and vulnerable family'.

Mr Pollard also criticised 'staggering inertia and complacency' at the local council.

Mr Askew had been bullied by three generations of youths on an estate in the Hattersley area of Greater Manchester.

He was pestered for money and cigarettes and on one occasion the yobs kicked in the family's front door.

Mocked as Dopey Dave, he had eggs and stones thrown at him when he went out. Windows of the family home were smashed.

During one two-month period he went to the offices of Tameside Council every day to complain while his mother called police 88 times.

Confrontation: Mr Askew argues with a thug outside his home. He was subjected to years of bullying by local youths who mocked him, threw eggs and bricks, and smashed his windows

The inquest heard the council's 
neighbourhood manager Mark Tunstall, who was in charge of community 
safety, was 'out of his depth' and never visited the family, even though
his office was just 400 yards away.

Neighbourhood police visited 
regularly, the inquest heard, but senior officers felt Mr Askew was 
'part of the problem' for giving the youths cigarettes in the hope they 
would leave.

Convicted: Kial Cottingham, 18, was sent to a young offenders institution for his role in the harassment

Mr Askew died in March last year after confronting youths 
outside the house over an overturned wheelie bin and over tampering with
his mother Rose's mobility scooter

In September last year Kial 
Cottingham, 19, who lived just doors away, pleaded guilty to harassing 
Mr Askew and was locked up for 16 months.

Prosecutors said there was no 
evidence to charge him with manslaughter. He apologised to the family 
when he gave evidence to the inquest.

At Trafford Coroners Court yesterday Mr Pollard recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.

He cited the evidence of a pathologist
who told the inquest that while it could not be scientifically proven 
that the stress of harassment on the night Mr Askew died led directly to
his death, the circumstances of the case 'strongly suggest' it had.

After the hearing David's mother Rose, now 90, said: 'I am still angry about what happened but there is no use hating people.'

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan
of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We have learned our lessons and 
made significant improvements to the way we deal with these crimes.'

David's mother, now aged 90, said that she is still angry about the attack, but added that the family have now been made to feel very welcome in the community

Earlier this year an Independent 
Police Complaints Commission report highlighted 'systemic failures' by 
the force to link the calls made by the family and treat the abuse as a 
hate crime.

It also found CCTV cameras installed to catch the culprits 
were next-to-useless because the picture quality was too poor to 
recognise their faces.

Tameside Council admitted that 'all agencies' needed to work more closely to ensure that the vulnerable were better protected.
