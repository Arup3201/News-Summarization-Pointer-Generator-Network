Judge Douglas Moore told the teaching assistant there had been a 'gross breach of trust' before jailing him for 18 months

 A shamed Commonwealth Games athlete has been jailed for 18 months after he admitted indulging in sexual activity with a schoolgirl.

Decathalete Kevin Sempers, 29, molested the 14-year-old on two consecutive days - once after she called him in tears when she was been bitten by a dog.

Sempers, a teaching assistant at a high school in west London who competed at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, was first contacted by the girl on Facebook 'as a dare'.

They began messaging, innocently to begin with but became sexual and they exchanged mobile phone numbers, Isleworth Crown Court heard.

Sempers suggested they meet up on 26 April last year and they went to a car park in Ealing where they kissed and touched each other.

When the girl said she did not want sex because she was too young, Sempers replied: 'I'll wait.'

The next day the student messaged Sempers saying she had been attacked by the dog, and the two met again - this time at an easyHotel carpark at Heathrow airport.

They ended up in the the backseat of his car where Sempers assaulted her.

After the girl confided in her friends, her school and social services received anonymous phone calls from a worried parent expressing concerns about Sempers' relationship with the girl.

Last month Sempers pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child under 16 just a day after a jury had been sworn in to try him.

Jailing Sempers, Judge Douglas Moore said: 'It's important to understand that you have a position of responsibility as a teaching assistant.

'I bear in mind the fact that initially in 2011 you had been involved involved in, and I accept that there was no ill will, Facebook contact with several girls.

Sempers, pictured competing at the European Cup Combined where he finished in 6th place with a score of 7503 points, was initially contacted by the girl on Facebook as a dare

'It is also accepted that the complainant contacted you as a dare, but it is perfectly clear you had opportunities to say to her do not contact me again.

'Instead you carried on and entered in a conversation over a period of time which led to the contact with this young girl. Meeting one was arranged and ended with what can only be described as a passionate kiss.

'The young girl said that she didn't want to have sex but you, in text form, and in my judgement very arrogantly, said 'I'll wait.'

'The second occasion I accept you did not initiate. You went into the back seat (of your car) at your behest, you took off her shirt and lay on the top of her.

But the  29-year-old, pictured in 2010 at the European Cup Combined events in Hengelo, arranged to meet up with the girl and went onto molest her over two days

'I accept to a limited degree that you may have taken the matter further. There was a gross breach of trust here - this girl was undoubtedly highly vulnerable and impressionable. 

'You knew full well you should not have contacted her and in my judgement there was an element of grooming. Perhaps your vanity and desire encouraged you to go ahead.

Sempers had narrowly missed out on a bronze when he represented England at the Delhi Commonwealth Games in 2010

The decathlete managed a personal best of 3,968 points on the first day of competition, which put him into fourth place going into the final day

But the second day, Sempers performance dropped and he eventually came in fifth place

'It is perfectly clear that this is entirely of your own making. Those who prey on young girls will undoubtedly receive an immediate custodial sentence of some duration.'

The court heard Sempers was deeply remorseful for his 'awful and damaging' choices which had damaged both his and the student's families.

He claimed he admitted the offence so his victim would not suffer the ordeal of testifying in court, it was said. 

Sempers, of Ferndale Crescent, Uxbridge, west London, admitted two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child under 16 years.

He was jailed for 18 months and will remain on the sex offenders' register for 10 years.
