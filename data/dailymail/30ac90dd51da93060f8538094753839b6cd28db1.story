Blake Lively's father has become the first patient to undergo a unique heart procedure that involves injecting the patient’s own stem cells into the organ to repair damaged muscle and arteries.

Former actor Ernie Lively suffered a massive heart attack in 2003 and has battled health problems since, but thanks to the groundbreaking medical procedure he is feeling better than ever.

‘I woke up the other morning and told my wife, “I haven't felt this good in years,”’ he told the University of Utah Health Care.

Blake Lively's father Ernie has become the first patient to undergo a unique heart procedure that involves injecting the patient¿s own stem cells into the organ to repair damaged muscle and arteries

In recent years the 66-year-old’s heart had only been half-functioning, which sapped his energy and made it a challenge for him even just to walk up a flight of stairs.

On 7 November, the father-of-four underwent retrograde gene therapy, in which a patient's stem cells are injected into the heart to repair damaged muscle and arteries.

With all his extra energy, Ernie has said he is looking forward to youngest daughter Blake, 26,  starting a family with her husband of just over a year, actor Ryan Reynolds, 37.

Ernie also backed up a claim made by Reynolds in July that the couple are keen to have a large family.

‘She is newly married and wants a big family. She says she wants 30 kids. I said, “Why don't you start with one?'” said Pa Lively.

He is also looking to finally make the most of beautiful mountains that surround his home in Heber City, Utah, that he shares with wife Elaine, also 66.

‘I moved to Utah because of the snow, but I haven't been able to ski. I literally didn't have the heart to do it. Now, I'm excited about living the rest of my life instead of sitting around.’

Lively’s acting credentials include a long list of TV and film appearances, including Passenger 57 and the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants - the latter that he starred in with his daughter, Blake.

More than six million people are 
currently living with heart failure.

As the condition progresses, 
patients’ options are usually limited to a heart transplant or assist 
devices, such as an artificial heart.

Dr Amit Patel, who developed the groundbreaking technique, wanted to find a way to intervene in the progression of heart failure before a patient advanced to the point of needing a heart transplant or device.

'It’s incredible. Imagine having a heart procedure that can potentially regenerate or rejuvenate your heart muscle - and it’s done as an outpatient procedure,' said Patel.
