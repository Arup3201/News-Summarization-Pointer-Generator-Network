The majority of taxi drivers have always been men but there are some women who are killing it as cabbies while balancing life's everyday pressures as they strive towards their dreams.

The Uber rideshare service has taken off around the globe and two Australian women have jumped behind the wheel of the popular initiative while they juggle studying for complete career changes, paying their bills and providing for their kids.

These inspirational ladies have not allowed obstacles to stop them from achieving what some may see as the impossible - and the convenience and flexibility of using their own cars and choosing the hours that suit them is making their crazy lives that bit easier and less stressful.

Alice Clark started her biomedicine degree in 1999 but was then struck down with viral encephalitis and had to learn to walk and talk again

Alice Clark, from Brisbane, has been through some pretty tough hurdles in the past 15 years but that hasn't stopped her from picking herself up, dusting herself off and pushing on with her dreams.

She started a biomedical degree in 1999 when she was mysteriously struck down with viral encephalitis which doctors believe may have been contracted by a random mosquito.

Although she has very little recollection of those next 18 months, let alone her time in hospital where her heart stopped twice, Alice, who was in her mid 20s at the time, had to start from scratch learning to walk and talk all over again.

'There were two other presentations in Brisbane at the time - one died and the other is a quadriplegic so I feel very blessed,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'From there, I must have stepped under a ladder, broken a few mirrors and annoyed a lot of black cats because the years that followed were shadowed by illness in my family as well as a very dear friend of mine who was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer.' 

Alice moved in with her friend Ellen for six months, to help care for her as she lost her life to lung cancer. 

'After this I had to take some time to myself to recover from the agony of watching a loved one fade away,' she said.

'Finally, this year I can begin again to finish what I started in what seems like a lifetime ago.'

Her studies were further delayed as she then cared for her mother and brother (left) who became ill over the past two years  she then discovered Uber ridesharing app (right) which found 'too good to be true'

Alice had to delay resuming her studies in 2013 when he mother fell ill and then delayed them a second time last year when she had to travel to Vietnam to look after her brother who became sick. 

Alice, who is now 38 years old, was finally able to start studying this year and she looked into what she could do for work on the side.

'The thought of going back into hospitality wasn't enticing and then I read about Uber and thought it was too good to be true because you get 80 per cent of your earnings,' she said.

'I was looking for the perfect job and it ticked all of the boxes which you rarely find.'

Alice balances her car trips with working the Defence Force, as a reserve medical attendant which she has been doing since 1995.

'It has allowed me to more comfortably balance the metaphorical work/study seesaw,' she said.

'I can drive when I am available and still fit in my studies and assessments. 

'The flexibility allows me to earn a living and study, without either pastime encroaching on the other.'

After surviving a near-death experience and then caring for three sick loves ones, it is now time for Alice to focus on herself and her future.

'Once these degrees are completed I hope to apply for Medical School with the aspirations of one day becoming a trauma or vascular surgeon in the Royal Australian Army,' she said.

'My ultimate dream is to spend six months with the military and six months working with Medicine Sans Frontier (Doctors without Borders).' 

Working as a cab driver works for Debra Walsh who can leave her son Tyler, 12, (right) at home for a few hours

She also have a passion for umpiring netball and is training to increase her levels so she can fulfill her dream of becoming an umpire at a national level

Debra goes home every couple of hours in between jobs to grab a bite and to check-in on Tyler

Debra Walsh just celebrated her 1,000th trip as a driver with Uber while she studies nursing - also with the aim towards a complete career change after a 20-year-career as an auto electrician in the mining industry.

She also has a passion for umpiring netball and is training to increase her levels so she can fulfill her dream of becoming an umpire at a national level. 

But most importantly, she provides full-time care for her son Tyler who is 12-years-old. 

'With all this happening, my ultimate dream is that my boy will grow into a respectful well-rounded adult with compassion, and a drive to work toward whatever he wants to be,' she said.

'He is old enough to leave at home for a couple of hours and I just come home in between jobs to go to the loo, get a feed and check up on him,' she said. 

'I'm lucky he's such a good, responsible boy - he has learnt to cook his own dinner and even cooked me dinner last night.'

Debra said she has never felt unsafe or in danger while ferrying around customers.

'Riders are always excited to have female drivers and you meet some really great people,' she said.

'Young people sometimes lack a bit of respect but I just go into mum mode and say "would you like to walk instead?".'
