Great Britain's Davis Cup team will face a rematch with the United States in the first round of the World Group next March.

Britain secured their place at the elite level of the competition for a second consecutive season by upsetting USA in San Diego in February and then lost narrowly to Italy in the quarter-finals.

Because Britain played on US soil the last time the two teams met, this tie will be played in Britain from March 6-8.

USA had been favoured to win the last tie but their choice of clay backfired and James Ward's victory over Sam Querrey coupled with two wins for Andy Murray decided it.

A home tie will not necessarily make Britain favourites this time, though, given USA were without number one John Isner last year.

Picking a surface will not be that easy for captain Leon Smith and his team given the fast indoor court they have selected for home ties in the past would also suit the US.

And the prowess of the Americans' doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan means whoever is picked as number two singles player - probably Ward - will likely need to win a rubber.

It will be Britain's first home match since April 2013, when they recovered from a 2-0 deficit to stun Russia at Coventry's Ricoh Arena.

It remains to be seen what effect Murray's declaration of support for an independent Scotland will have on his commitment to a British Davis Cup team, although he has always stressed his pride at representing Britain in the past.

The 27-year-old played sporadically while Britain were in the lower reaches of the competition but has been an ever-present over the last three ties.

Murray's loss to Italy's Fabio Fognini in April was just his second in 19 singles rubbers, and he has committed to playing both singles and doubles to help Britain's cause.

His doubles partner in two of the last three ties, fellow Scot Colin Fleming, has also backed independence, as has Murray's brother Jamie, with whom he has previously played in the competition.

Having said following his Wimbledon victory last summer that he would make his position public despite not having a vote, Murray reversed that in March, citing the long-running fall-out from his 2006 joke about supporting 'anyone but England' Aat the World Cup.

However, only a matter of hours before the polls opened, Murray wrote on Twitter: "Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!"

Murray said during the recent US Open that he would expect to represent Scotland at the Rio Olympics in 2016 should there be a 'yes' vote.

The question of what would happen to the Davis Cup team in that instance has not really been addressed, but it could be that a unified British team remains in place.

Victory for Britain over the US would mean another home tie against either top seeds France or Germany in July, while the pick of the other first-round ties are derby matches between Argentina and Brazil and Serbia and Croatia.
