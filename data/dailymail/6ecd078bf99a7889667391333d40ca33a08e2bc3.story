A fire stoked by strong winds swept through a three-story house early Sunday, killing five people along with a 6-week-old baby.

The Essex County prosecutor's office said the fire started about 6 am in the single-family home a few blocks north of Route 280. The cause is under investigation.

The victims were identified as 79-year-old Alice Horton; 20-year-old Breiona Love, 6-week-old Lanore Carter-Love; 56-year-old Randy Horton and 60-year-old Ronnie Horton.

First responders: Firefighters carry the body of a victim from a burned three-story, single-family house in East Orange, New Jersey, on Sunday

Victims:  Five people, ranging in age from six weeks to 78 years, were killed in an early morning fire at the house

It wasn't immediately known which of or how the victims were related.

One female resident escaped and was rescued from the roof of the house, according to news reports. Her name was not released.

Christopher Weiss, deputy chief of the East Orange Fire Department, said the home is in a neighborhood of structures that date back to the late 19th century.

'It's one of the oldest neighborhoods in East Orange,' he said. 'Historically, we've had a lot of serious fires here.'

Weiss said the fire had collapsed the back of the house.

One person living in a house next door escaped safely.

He told 1010 WINS of the female resident that had been rescued from the roof of the house 'She had heavy smoke and fire starting to come from the windows in her area, but fortunately we were able to get to her.'

'I lost my mother-in-law; I lost my niece; I lost my cousin. This ain’t right,' a woman said to the radio station. 

The New York Post reported that a man who was allegedly the father of the infant said yelled 'My baby, my baby! I lost my baby!'

The North Jersey Region of the American Red Cross said it was helping two families displaced by the fire. Three volunteers responded to provide emotional support and emergency assistance. Four members of the two families were provided assistance in the form of temporary lodging, food and clothing, the agency said. 

Evacuate: One female resident escaped and was rescued from the roof of the house, according to news reports. A firefighter is seen here searching through the home's windows 

Wreckage: Christopher Weiss, deputy chief of the East Orange Fire Department, said the home is in a neighborhood of structures that date back to the late 19th century
