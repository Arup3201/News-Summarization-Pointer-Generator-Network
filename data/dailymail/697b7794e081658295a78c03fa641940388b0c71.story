California's cities are so polluted they pose a serious health risk to their millions of residents for 135 'smog days' a year, experts have revealed.

America's worst, the Riverside-San Bernadino area and Los Angeles, also had 27 'red alert' days in 2010 where air quality was so bad healthy people could 
develop breathing difficulties or even have a heart attack.

A new environmental study has ranked every American metropolitan area by smog and Baltimore, Washington DC and Philadelphia make up the rest of the top five, followed by Houston, Atlanta, Sacramento, St Louis, and Louisville.

In total the five worst cities, with more than 25 million residents
between them, had 274 smog days combined last year.

As set out in the Clean Air Act, a smog day is when ozone was within the range of 60 to 70 parts per billion of air for more than eight hours. It becomes a red alert day when it exceeds that range.

Controversially the Obama administration was going to consider lowering these levels this month to improve standards, but has now shelved it for two years.

Environment America , who have published the data, also say 48 per cent of all Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of smog pollution.

'Americans deserve clean air. But on far too many days, people all across the country are exposed to dangerous smog pollution,' a spokesman said.

'Pollution from power plants and vehicles puts the health of our nation’s children and families at risk.

'Studies show that on days with high concentrations of smog pollution in the air, children and adults suffer more asthma attacks, increased respiratory difficulty, and reduced lung function. Exposure to smog pollution can exacerbate respiratory illness and even cause premature death.'

Childhood asthma: More than 165,000 children in Los Angeles alone have the condition

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the national standard for smog based on the latest science on air quality and public health.

But the EPA's own independent scientists say the current standard, set in 2008, does not adequately protect public health.

As a result, Environment America's report says people nationwide have been 'exposed to days of poor air quality each summer without even knowing it.'

A state by state comparison has also been carried out with California dominating with 135 days smog days in 2010, more than a 
third of the year.

Californian Republican Lucille Roybal-Allard said the report 'confirms what we already know,' but that this was unacceptable.

'In Los Angeles, we know that smog is a major threat to the health of our families. Over 700,000 people in our city suffer from asthma, including 165,000 children,' she said.

Texas, Utah, Maryland, Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey, Ohio and New York each had at least 30 of these days in 2010.

Seventeen states experienced at least one “red alert” day for unhealthy air, 
indicating pollution levels high enough in a particular area so that anyone 
could start experiencing adverse health effects.

And only nine states did not record any 
days in 2010 on which levels of smog pollution exceeded the standard, which were Alaska, 
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and 
Wyoming.
