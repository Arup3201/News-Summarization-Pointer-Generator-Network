The parents of a little girl whose school bus left her alone by a busy road have spoken of their outrage.

Katie Dutson was left in tears when she found herself waiting in a lay-by.

The morning bus which normally takes her to the Dorchester school dropped her 50 yards from the gates 15 minutes earlier than usual.

Six-year-old Katie Dutson was left alone on a layby by a school bus. Parents Kris and Helen say they are outraged

Katie was the only passenger destined for Winterbourne Valley First School that day.

She was left sobbing for a quarter of an hour because there were no staff around to see her safely inside.

The blunder happened on the A35 near Dorchester - one of the busiest roads in south west England.

The driver simply let little Katie get off and drove away; despite there being no one to help her get inside the school gates.

Another parent found the youngster and took her into the school.

Katie’s parents, Kris and Helen, are livid that their daughter was left alone by the busy trunk road.

Full-time mum Helen,
45, from nearby Compton Valence, said: 'Anything could have happened to her, it’s such a busy road. I was horrified.

'They had changed the times 
so much that Katie was picked up very early in the morning and was 
dropped off so early the lady who normally meets her wasn’t there.'

She added: 'Her headmistress phoned me to say what had happened and that she had phoned the local council.'

The local authority which runs the school bus service has said it is sorry for the error.

Katie's dad, photographer Kris, 53, said: 'It was an incredibly dangerous situation.

'She came home from school crying and told us it was really scary.

'When I think of what could have happened 
to her it is so upsetting, you hear of so many awful things nowadays 
like abductions and accidents.

'We entrusted our child to the bus company and they have let us down big time.'

A spokesman for Damory Coaches, which runs the service for Dorset County Council, said the bus timetable and route will be changed so pupils at the school arrive in time to be met by staff.

A Dorset County Council spokesman apologised for any distress caused. He added: 'We are working with the bus company so that the child will be dropped off when the school is open.'
