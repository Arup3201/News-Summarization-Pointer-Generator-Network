Scientists
have managed to 'reset' human  stem cells in a move which could lead to the development of cures for heart and eye diseases,
Parkinson's and stroke victims.

In 'a major step
forward', British and Japanese  scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7
to 10-day old embryo, before it implants in the womb.

By studying the reset cells, they said they hoped they would
now be able to learn more about embryo development, and how it
can go wrong and cause miscarriage and developmental disorders.

'These cells may represent the real starting point for
formation of tissues in the human embryo,' said Austin Smith,
director of the Britain's Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, who
co-led the research published in the journal Cell on Thursday.

'We hope that in time they will allow us to unlock the
fundamental biology of early development, which is impossible to
study directly in people,' he added.

Human pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to
become any of the cells and tissues in the body, can already be
made in a lab either from cells extracted from early-stage
embryos or from adult cells that have been induced, or
reprogrammed, into an earlier state.

But, the researchers said, until now it has
proved difficult to generate human pluripotent stem cells that
are at an early enough, pristine stage, before they have started
changing.

Instead, scientists have only derived cells that are
slightly further down the developmental pathway, not a totally 'blank slate', said Smith.

Experts say that by helping to regenerate tissue, stem cell
science could offer new ways of treating conditions for which
there are currently no cures - including heart and eye diseases,
Parkinson's and stroke.

The process of generating stem cells in the lab is much
easier to control in mouse cells, which can be frozen in a state
of very early pluripotency using a protein called LIF. Human
cells are not as responsive to LIF, so they must be controlled
in a different way that involves switching key genes on and off.

Smith said this was the main reason why scientists have been
unable to generate human pluripotent cells that are as primitive
and pristine as their mouse equivalents.

To avoid this problem, the scientists introduced two genes -
NANOG and KLF2 - which caused a network of genes controlling the
cell to reboot and induce the early pluripotent state.

Yasuhiro Takashima of the Japan Science and Technology
Agency, who worked with Smith, said the reset cells opened the
door to a new phase of research.

'We now need to carry out further studies to establish how
our cells compare with others,' he said.

'We don't yet know
whether these will be a better starting point than existing stem
cells for therapies, but being able to start entirely from
scratch could prove beneficial.'

Chris Mason, a stem cell expert and professor of
regenerative medicine at University College London who was not
involved in this work, praised its results and implications.

'Having a source of pristine stem cells which can be
precisely changed into clinical-relevant cell types is a major
step forward,' he said in an emailed comment.

'The benefits could be safer and more clinically effective
cell therapies produced at lower cost - good news for patients
and healthcare providers.'
