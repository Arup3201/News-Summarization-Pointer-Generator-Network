A pair of robins have put a spanner in the works after building a nest in a mechanic's motorbike.

Anthony Straight, 49, of Romford, Essex, found the birds in the grill seconds after turning his Honda Interceptor engine on before taking it out for a spin.

Inside the nest were tiny eggs which have since hatched and the baby robins are expected to fledge in the next couple of days.

The birds now have been in the bike for about two and a half weeks which has meant Mr Straight has had to give up his wheels and find an alternative mode of transport.

Mr Straight said: 'The bike started smoking and smouldering and I was worried that it meant an expensive bit of work was on the cards.

'But on closer inspection, I found a bird's nest with three eggs inside. I couldn't believe it.

'I was concerned I'd done some damage by running the engine but decided to leave the nest where it was to see what happened. Not long later I saw the parents returning to the nest.'

Discovery: The birds have now been in the bike for about two-and-a-half weeks

No-one knows exactly how they ended up inside the engine but during the mild weather many birds have started nesting.

Mr Straight said: 'I was concerned Iâ€™d done some damage by running the engine but decided to leave the nest where it was to see what happened. Not long later I saw the parents returning to the nest.

'The RSPB advised me to leave the bike alone and the next day a fourth egg appeared. After a while, two of the eggs hatched into healthy, hungry robin chicks and the parents have been taking it in turns to feed them ever since.

'I canâ€™t wait to get my bike back though, it has been hard not riding it in the good weather.'

Richard James, wildlife advisor at the Royal Society for Protection of Birds, said: 'Birds are naturally secretive and tend to build their nests in hidden places for safety, so you may not realise.

'Luckily Anthony did and responded in the right way.'
