In these parts, a pay phone is a visitor's best option for reaching the rest of the world. A cell phone signal is an hour away by car. Wi-Fi is forbidden.

The radio plays nothing but static. And other than the occasional passing pickup truck whose driver offers a wave, it's dead silent in Green Bank, West Virginia.

Seemingly off the beaten path, this community of fewer than two hundred residents is the heart of the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), a 13,000-square-mile area where state and federal laws discourage the use of everyday devices that emit electromagnetic waves.

All quiet on the home front: Michael Holstine, business manager at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, walks out of a shed underneath the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia

The telescope towers over farmland as dusk falls in Green Bank. Officials at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory chose the site for its remote location and mountainous surroundings, which help to keep distant radio waves outside of the quiet zone

The quiet zone aims to protect sensitive radio telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, as well as a nearby Naval research facility, from man-made interference.

This silence enables the observatory to detect energy in outer space that is equivalent to the energy emitted by a single snowflake hitting the ground.

While scientists listen intently for clues from the universe on its structure and origins, residents in some of the timeworn railroad towns in this valley maintain a fundamentally tech-less lifestyle that for most Americans is a memory.

More than 90 per cent of American adults have a cell phone today, yet some locals fondly recall ditching their wireless device after moving here. After all, it's useless, and that's fine by them.

A shuttered sawmill that closed in 1960 stands near the banks of the Greenbrier River in Cass. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory settled on Pocahontas County and its early-20th century railroad towns in part because there was no industry in the area that posed the threat of creating radio frequency interference

The NRQZ was set up by
the Federal
Communications Commission in 1958.

The zone does not ban all radio transmissions - for example police, ambulance and fire department radios are used there.

Exceptions to the rule are allowed for remote alarm systems and extreme weather warnings.

The only broadcast radio stations in the heart of the Quiet Zone are part of the Allegheny Mountain Radio network with just one station in the AM band, and several low-power FM stations.

The area has been popular with people who believe that they are suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity - a term for those who believe they are being exposed to radio waves from electronic devices which leave them with health problems.

A phone booth stands on the side of a road in Head Waters, inside the National Radio Quiet Zone. While pay phones have all but disappeared in the United States, they still can be found in this part of the country, where a cell phone signal is hard to come by

A truck passes through Head Waters inside the National Radio Quiet Zone. A 2013 poll reported that 91 per cent of Americans have a cell phone - but not in this part of the world

Mr Holstine oversees the rural area which contains some of the largest telescopes in the country. The rapid increase of technology in American households over the last 15 years has made the job of keeping the surroundings interference-free a challenge.
