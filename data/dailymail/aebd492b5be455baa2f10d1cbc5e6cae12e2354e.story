Facebook's digital cloud met with an actual weather system when the company's air conditioning system malfunctioned and actually formed a rain cloud inside the social media giant's data center headquarters.

The company recently revealed that when their Prineville, Oregon Data Center, which contains all of Facebook's severs, opened in 2011, the building's energy efficient cooling system combined the hot air coming off the severs with a water-based cooling system in the air vents.

The system was supposed to cool the air down, but instead the clash of temperatures made the air so wet that it condensed and formed a rain cloud inside the sever room, panicking workers and shorting out the social media system.

The sever room in Facebook's data center in Oregon (pictured here) was drenched by an actual rain cloud that formed inside the building after the company's air conditioning system malfunctioned

'I got a call, 'Jay, there's a cloud in the data center',' Jay Parikh, Facebook's Vice President of Infrastructure Engineering, told The Register.

Parikh continued narrating the conversation, ''What do you mean, outside? No, inside'.

He remembered how panicked the employees sounded, finally realizing himself that, 'It was raining in the datacenter.'

When the freak weather event took place two summers ago Facebook officially labeled it a 'humidity event,' according to the website.

The social media leader employed an air conditioning unit the used outside air instead of a less energy efficient model to cool their massive server room, which uses energy-intensive direct expansion cooling units.

The system was designed to take in hot air coming off the severs and cool it down with the use of a water-based cooling system.

Facebook's data center cooling center (seen here being shown by Tom Furlong, director of site operations) malfunctioned, causing a rain cloud to form inside the company's sever room, shorting the system

The unit then recycled this cool air back out into the sever room, however, an unforeseen complication caused the air to condense as it cooled.

The condensed air eventually accumulated and formed a rain cloud in the sever room, damaging several units.

The company released an official account of the incident stating 'This resulted in cold aisle supply temperature exceeding 80Â°F and relative humidity exceeding 95 per cent. The Open Compute servers that are deployed within the data center reacted to these extreme changes. Numerous servers were rebooted and few were automatically shut down due to power supply unit failure.'

Since the indoor rain cloud passed over Facebook's blue skies, the company has learned from their mistakes.

Jay Parikh, Facebook's Vice President of Infrastructure Engineering, could hardly believe what employees were telling him when they phoned to say that it was raining INSIDE Facebook's data center

The data center now designs its severs with a 'rubber raincoat,' Parikh told the site.

Facebook severs now have a seal over their power supply to protect from any condensation that could form on its surface.

'This is one of those things. When you are 100 per cent aircooled it's awesome from an efficiency perspective,' Parikh said, 'but the range you have to operate in is much, much wider.'

Since the incident occurred two years ago the Facebook facility has had nothing but sunny skies, so to speak, in their sever room, and after improving their building management system, predict that there's no more chance of rainclouds on the horizon.
