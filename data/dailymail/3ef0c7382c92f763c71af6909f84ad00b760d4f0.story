A nurse has been found guilty of killing a mother of two after carrying her on the bonnet of her car and deliberately swerving to fling her off.

Ophelia Okai-Koi, 51, sped off with 33-year-old Christie McHugh on her bonnet after they started arguing over parking outside the Lord Kitchener pub in New Barnet, north London.

She drove down the street with the victim 'spread out like a starfish', before turning sharply in a bid to throw her off.

Victim: Ophelia Okai-Koi, 51, has been found guilty of killing Christie McHugh, 33, after carrying her on her car and deliberately swerving to fling her off. Above, Ms McHugh is pictured with her husband, John, and her son

Mrs McHugh died in front of her husband, John, five-year-old son and five-month-old daughter after falling off the bonnet and smashing her skull on a metal post outside the pub.

Now, Okai-Koi, who works as a mental health nurse, has been convicted of causing death by careless driving at Harrow Crown Court.

She was cleared by a jury of the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving.

The court heard that Mrs McHugh, who weighed 20 stone, had confronted Okai-Koi after she parked in the pub's car park while shopping at a nearby Sainsbury's store in March last year.

Scene: Okai-Koi sped off with Mrs McHugh on her bonnet after they started arguing over parking outside the Lord Kitchener pub (pictured) in New Barnet, north London. The mother of two was 'spread out like a starfish'

Family: Mrs McHugh died in front of her family after Okai-Koi deliberately swerved and she fell off the bonnet

The mother, who had been drinking, claimed the nurse's vehicle had blocked the rear door of her own car, preventing her from putting her son's baby seat into the back of it.

Mrs McHugh and her husband then started repeatedly kicking Okai-Koi's car - prompting her to block them in and call the police.

Witnesses told the court they had heard the infuriated couple shouting that it was a private car park and Okai-Koi should not have parked there.

Amrita Choudra, who was at the scene, said Mr McHugh had screamed 'f*** you' while kicking Okai-Koi's car '20 times in total'.

Mrs McHugh then sat on the bonnet of the vehicle and started to 'bounce' around, before the nurse suddenly drove off, the court heard.

'The person driving the car didn’t seem to care,' said Ms Choudra. 'The car sped off at great, great speed. I couldn’t believe the person would drive away.'

Nina Steel, who worked at the Sainsbury’s store, said Mrs McHugh had been spread out on the bonnet 'like a starfish'.

She added: 'The car reversed a bit, before going full steam ahead. It turned suddenly and she was flung off the car.'

Alison Hunter, QC prosecuting, said Okai-Koi had not been 'panicking', but rather acting with 'self righteousness'.

'This is a two way fight,' she said. 'Ms Okai-Koi is involving herself with at every step of the way, fuelling it.'

She added that the nurse had 'lost the plot' and 'decided to teach Christie a lesson' by 'put[ting] her foot down... to throw her off'.

Summarising the case, Judge Freya Newbery said: 'The only live issue in this case is the question of whether a car should ever be driven blindly out of a car park at speed on to a busy road with an unsecured, 20-stone drunken person flailing about on the bonnet.

'She undoubtedly intended to throw this annoying aggressive drunken woman who was bouncing around on her bonnet off it. 

'She undoubtedly heard the bang, she undoubtedly saw her on the floor out of the rear view mirror, and at that point she undoubtedly realised what she had done. And still she drove on.

'I have no doubt that she was in a total panic by that time. But at no point before that moment did she panic.'

Okai-Koi, from New Barnet, told the court she had 'feared for her life' when the couple confronted her in the pub's car park.

Daniel O’Malley, defending, added: 'Maybe she shouldn’t have used the car park, but it had nothing to do with them. 

'It was a matter for the pub, not the customers.'

Mr O'Malley claimed the defendant had not realised that Mrs McHugh was on her bonnet, but had simply seen a 'huge image' and 'bolted'.

Okai-Koi has been released on bail and is due to be sentenced next month.
