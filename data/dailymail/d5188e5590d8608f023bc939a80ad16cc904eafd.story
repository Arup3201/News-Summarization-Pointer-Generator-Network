Department store Macy's has a 'secret' black Santa who can only be seen on special request, it has been revealed.

And because the store does not advertise the service, most customers are completely unaware it is even an option.Â 

The African American version is not publicly promoted, meaning that parents need to know what they are looking for when they bring their children to meet with the character.

Reporter Amy Nelson of Animal New York went to the flagship store in Herald Square to see how the issue of dueling Santas was being handled by the cheerful elves.

'Special' Santa: After asking for the 'special' version, an administrator directed Amy to a different version of Father Christmas, showing that the store did have multiple options available

First go around: Animal New York reporter Amy Nelson was automatically taken to the advertised white Santa when she went to the flagship Macy's store in Manhattan recently

She was initially brought first to the lengthy line of children and parents who were waiting patiently for the white Father Christmas.

She asked the big man if he was the only Santa in the building, and he stuck to the script.

'That's me- I'm the special Santa, and the everyday Santa and the good-looking Santa and the ugly Santa and the everybody Santa!' the white Santa said.

Ms Nelson then asked one of the awaiting elves and who seemed to know exactly what she was talking about when she asked for the 'special Santa'.

The man directed her towards the elves in the 'maze' of a line who could then 'set that up' for her.

Hefty line: The wait for the white Santa topped out at more than 45 minutes

Personal attention: There was only one little girl in line waiting for the black Santa

'About five minutes later, an official-looking woman not dressed as an elf brought me to another lodge... where a toddler-aged black girl and her black mother were wrapping up their time with a black Santa Claus,' Ms Nelson wrote.

Diversity issues and political correctness are not the only two reasons why the question of a black Santa has become a hot-topic this holiday season as Fox News host Megyn Kelly declared that 'Santa just is white'.

She later apologized on air and said that she meant the comment comically, though that didn't stop Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live from skewering her segment.

The black Santa in Macy's made a clear effort to stay out of the fray and avoid getting involved in the debate when asked by Ms Nelson.

'I've heard of this story but Santa hasn't had much time to sit down and watch TV. This is the busiest time of the season!' the black Santa told Ms Nelson.

MailOnline's multiple calls to Macy's press representatives were not immediately answered.
