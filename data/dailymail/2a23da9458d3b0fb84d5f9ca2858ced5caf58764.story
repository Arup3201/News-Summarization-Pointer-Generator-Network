Gus Poyet is a relieved man after landing two fellow South Americans having earlier warned that failure to sign his targets would be ‘very dangerous’.

The Black Cats completed season-long loan deals for Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates and Inter Milan winger Ricky Alvarez on Monday – but there was also disappointment after missing out on Fabio Borini.

Poyet – whose side only escaped relegation last season thanks to four wins from their final five matches – had feared another campaign of struggle at the wrong end of the Premier League.

Danger averted: Gus Poyet has admitted the Black Cats could have struggled without new signings

Indeed, he said at the weekend: ‘If we don’t get the players in, we’ve got a problem. It would be dangerous, very dangerous.’

Poyet has been a long-time admirer of Uruguayan compatriot Coates and he made it clear to the club’s hierarchy that he wanted the 23-year-old. The centre-back – who managed only 12 league appearances in three years at Anfield – is expected to form a partnership with skipper John O’Shea.

Alvarez, meanwhile, represents something of a coup for the Wearside club. The 26-year-old was part of Argentina’s World Cup squad and has been capped on seven occasions. He appeared 90 times for Inter following a £10m move from Velez Sarsfield in 2010, and Sportsmail understands a similar fee has been agreed to make his move permanent should he impress for Sunderland this season.

But Borini’s rejection is also a source of regret for Poyet. He had waited all summer for an answer from the Liverpool frontman over a return to the club, where he spent last season on loan. The Italian, though, was never keen on re-signing and Sunderland have not added a striker to their ranks as the manager had hoped. Borini remained at Anfield after a move to QPR fell though over wage demands.

The one that got away: Sunderland failed in their protracted attempt to bring back Fabio Borini 

Two players did leave the club, however, defender Valentin Roberge joining Stade de Reims on loan for the remainder of the season, while Modibo Diakite had his contract terminated by mutual consent.
