A Family Services employee has been fired after a seven-year-old boy was beaten to death two days after the department received a call that the boy was being abused - but failed to act on it.

Roderick 'RJ' Arrington died on November 30 after he was allegedly brutally beaten by his stepfather, Markiece Palmer, 34, and mother, Dina Palmer, 27, at their home in Las Vegas.

Two days earlier, the couple had allegedly beaten the boy for lying about reading a bible verse and for failing to finish his homework, and staff at his school noticed he was unable to sit properly.

He told staff at Roundy Elementary he had been 'spanked' by his parents the night before; police said he was beaten with a paddle and whipped with a belt.

School officials followed protocol and immediately called the Family Services hotline to report the apparent abuse, theÂ Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

But when no one from the department arrived at the school, RJ went home, where he was whipped and beaten by his parents. They called 911 and he died the following day.

The arrest report noted 'open abrasions on [Arrington's] buttocks, severe bruising to his thighs, marks and bruises on his back and shoulders and evidence of previous beatings'. He also suffered brain swelling, the report noted.

A police report said RJ suffered massive 
brain swelling and bruising over much of his body, including arms, 
abdomen, back, legs, thighs and buttocks, where he had open wounds.

The couple have been charged with murder and two counts of child abuse. Investigators said Dina Palmer 'stood by and let her husband' shake and beat her son to death.

The Clark County Department of Family Services has now released a statement saying some of its staff failed to follow policies before the youngster's death.

Investigators determined after RJ's death that the school district officials fulfilled their legal requirements by calling the hotline.

Beaten: RJ's teacher's noticed he was not able to sit down at school and he told them he had been spanked, but when school officials called the Family Services hotline, they did not send any help for the boy

In danger: The young boy had only lived with his mother and stepfather for three months

Police also found that Family Services had 
not committed a crime, but had issues with 'their reporting 
protocols' and would be handled internally and criminal charges are unlikely.

The Family Services Department spokesperson said they could not name the fired employee or why exactly they were let go as it was a confidential matter.

A special Child Death Review Team will now meet so that all parties, including police, Family Services state partners and the school district, can learn from the case.

RJ, who was remembered by his family as a talented singer and performer, lived with his father and grandmother in Illinois until three months before his death.

Locked up: His mother and stepfather are now in jail awaiting a preliminary hearing on March 1

RJ's paternal grandfather, George Roach, told the Review-Journal that the fact that someone had been fired did not bring him any comfort - and he wants county employees to face criminal charges.

'That is what the agency is for, to protect our kids,' he said. 'When a kid says, "I'm being abused," something has to be done immediately.'

'Somebody is liable for this child being dead. It could have been prevented... The child was crying for help.'

Markiece and Dina Palmer remain in the Clark County jail without bail and have a preliminary court hearing on March 1.
