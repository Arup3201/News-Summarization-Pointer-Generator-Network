Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard clung to her bodyguard as she was dragged to safety through a crowd of angry protesters in Canberra yesterday.

Riot police formed a shield around the prime minister as they helped her force a path through the protesters who surrounded a restaurant where she was attending an awards ceremony to mark Australia Day.

Miss Gillard stumbled after losing a shoe in the scuffle, but was caught by her personal security guard and managed to get into a waiting car.

Heading to safety: Dozens of extra police were called and after 20 minutes they escorted Miss Gillard  from the building to an awaiting car

The protests appear to have been aimed primarily at opposition leader Tony Abbott, who was also in the building when some 200 demonstrators began banging on its windows, shouting 'shame' and 'racist'.

Mr Abbott had angered activists earlier in the day by saying it was time the nearby Aboriginal Tent Embassy 'moved on'.

The embassy, a
 ramshackle collection of tents and shelters on the lawn of Parliament 
House, is at the centre of the campaign for Aboriginal sovereignty and 
land rights.

Demonstrators had gathered to celebrate its 40th anniversary when they heard that Mr Abbott was nearby.

Miss Gillard and Mr Abbott had been handing out inaugural National Emergency Medals, presented as the country marked Australia Day.

Dozens
 of extra police were called to the scene and
 escorted them from the building after 20 minutes.

Miss Gillard was unharmed and hosted another Australia Day function at her official residence in Canberra after the incident.

Australia Day marks the arrival of the first fleet of British colonists in Sydney on January 26, 1788.

Many Aborigines call it Invasion Day because the land was settled without a treaty with traditional owners.

There have also been suggestions that the day be moved because it currently falls during school holidays.

A different date would allow greater participation in the event among children.

The first celebration was held in 1818, marking the creation of New South Wales.

Another way to celebrate: Swimmers are seen competing in the Great Aussie Swim as part of the Australia Day festivities in Sydney Harbour
