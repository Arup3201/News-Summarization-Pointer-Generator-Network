A Russian baby is in intensive care after being crushed by a huge block of snow as he laid in his buggy.

Eight-month-old Kuzma Yermolayev was being taken for a walk by his grandparents in Kirov, in western Russia, when the block dislodged from the top of a five-story building.

Kuzma had to be rushed to hospital where he is being treated for a fractured skull, brain trauma and abdominal contusion.

The terrible incident was caught on camera and his grandparents can be seen frantically trying to dig out the baby from under the snow.

Horrified Grandma Iraida Korovina, 62, said: 'We had only just left the house when our lives were destroyed by this terrible, terrible accident.

'When the snow hit we were so shocked we couldn't comprehend what had happened.

'We uncovered little Kuzma who was bleeding and unconscious and a kind neighbour called for an ambulance.

'I can't begin to express how traumatic this is, for both us and his parents.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'He is in a very serious condition.

'The block of snow was tightly packed to almost ice, and when it hit him it caused severe damage.'

City spokesman Maria Yuzhanina said: 'There should have been a warning sign if there was a dangerous build up of snow, and something on the roof to stop it falling.

'The police and we are examining the CCTV footage to establish whether the build up of snow was down to negligence on behalf of the home owners who are supposed to clear it away.

'If that is the case then whoever was responsible for not carrying out their job will be charged with negligence leading to endangering of human life.

'If any person is found guilty of negligence, the individual could be fined anywhere between 100,000-500,000 RUB (£1,447-£7,235) and face either six years in prison or five years of compulsory community service.'
