A man threatened to kill a judge after a dispute over funeral costs.

Kenneth Boxall reacted angrily when District Judge Ron Coia refused to let him appeal a Department of Works and Pensions decision to reduce a funeral grant from £742 to £691.

The 58-year-old denied making the threat to shoot Judge Coia, but was found guilty at the end of a four-day trial at Teesside Crown Court last month.

Kenneth Boxall, 58, from Peterlee, County Durham, has avoided a custodial sentence, after Teesside Crown Court heard he threatened to shoot Judge Ron Coia

He was given a suspended sentence and ordered to observe a curfew.

Prosecutor Richard Bennett told the court: 'He contacted the tribunal service in Newcastle to discuss the case.

'During the call he told Erin Slater, a clerk, he would find out where Judge Coia lives and shoot him.

'His intention to do so was repeated later in the call. The threat was taken seriously, as it had to be, but it’s now accepted there was no intention to harm the judge.'

Boxall, of Peterlee, County Durham, was convicted of making threats to kill on September 1, 2010.

He has previous convictions for assault, fraud and related offences of dishonesty, and theft.

Teesside Crown Court heard Boxall has previous convictions for assault, fraud and related offences of dishonesty, and theft

His last conviction was in 1986.

Representing himself, Boxall said: 'The case has taken a long time to come to court partly because I had six solicitors and 10 barristers, although I was happy with a couple of them.

'I can’t agree with the remarks in the pre-sentence report about my inter-personal skills, but I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion.

'I am a carer for members of my family.'

Judge Peter Armstong sentenced Boxall to 12 months in prison suspended for two years, and a night-time curfew for eight weeks.

The judge said: 'Making a threat against any public servant is a serious matter, but I accept this threat was made in temper and never likely to be carried out.

'The offence still passes the custody threshold, but I have concluded society will be better served by you remaining at home to carry out your caring duties.'

Boxall said he intends to appeal his conviction.
