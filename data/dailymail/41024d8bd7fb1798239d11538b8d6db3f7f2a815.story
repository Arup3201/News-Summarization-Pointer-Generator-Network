Like many super-organised ladies with an eye for a bargain, Rose Bradley has already bought all her gift-wrap and cards for the coming Christmas in the January sales. ‘I’ve always done it. It’s cheaper and this way you spread the cost throughout the year,’ she says.

Old habits die hard, it seems — even when you’ve got a couple of million in the bank. After all, as Rose, 61, points out: ‘Why spend more money than you need to?’

It’s a slogan she’s likely to take to her grave, along with her equally thrifty friends, despite their astonishing good fortune: ten years ago, Rose and ten of her colleagues at the Tesco store where they worked in the Yorkshire town of Driffield discovered they had won £18 million on the Lottery.

Valued: Back row, Rose Bradley, Sue Harris and Sue Brusby. Front row, Kirsty Holmes and Elaine Leason

Seven women and two men in the syndicate each pocketed £1.4 million while two members, who had double shares in the group’s 13 entry lines, won £2.8 million.

It’s a serious amount of money by anyone’s standards, but particularly for a group who happily describe themselves as working class — checkout assistants who had spent their lives saving to pay for modest holidays and a second-hand car, or who would, in the words of Sue Brusby, 65, ‘panic’ if the washing machine broke down, because it meant blowing a hole in the tight monthly budget.

All of them, then, could be forgiven for going a bit overboard with their new found wealth: WAG style mansions, a modest yacht, a Ferrari — all were within grasp in this reasonably priced part of the country.

But then this is Yorkshire, where they don’t have much truck with showiness — although Sue’s husband Peter did ‘splash out’ on a second-hand Mondeo. They haven’t even engaged in the sort of bickering that often characterises syndicate relations once the fuss has died down.

A decade after their win, a sizeable number of the gang meet for lunch at least once a month. ‘We don’t talk about money,’ says Rose. ‘We don’t need to. Families, homes, holidays — that’s what we chat about.’

Certainly, when I meet with five of them at a pub in Driffield there is nothing to betray their wealth. Except the suspiciously bronzed decolletage of Sue Harris, 64, who has just returned from a month-long Caribbean cruise with her husband Norman, 68, a former factory foreman.

But that’s about as flashy as it gets. While Lottery history is littered with fortunes squandered, here in Yorkshire sound good sense and knowing the value of a pound is the order of the day. ‘It’s in your background I think,’ says Sue Brusby. ‘My mum and dad scrimped and saved for everything they had and I think it makes you value things more.’

Ten years ago, on a £5.67 hourly wage on the Tesco checkout, there was no cash to splash. Little wonder the Lottery was a tempting prospect, and it was Rose who kicked off proceedings. She had already worked at the store for nine years when, in 1995, it got a Lottery terminal and she decided to play.

Enlisting her friends to form a syndicate, Rose insisted on a couple of rules: you paid a pound a line, if you didn’t pay you didn’t get your share if they won, and the numbers could never be changed.

‘We had 13 of us paying in at a pound a line — when a member dropped out someone else would pick up their line.’ It’s in this way that she got two shares, with her husband Keith, 70, picking up a share, too (giving the couple £4.2 million when they won).

Before the big scoop, modest winnings were spent on ‘checkout’ nights out: ‘Alcohol. Lots of,’ cackles Sue Brusby. A £1,000 prize from five numbers one year left them all wondering if that was the only windfall they would ever have.

That is, until the evening of Monday July 26, 2005, when Sue Brusby — who had recently been given a pay rise to £200 a week — returned from a weekend away in the family caravan and casually checked the group’s numbers.

‘And there they were,’ she recalls. ‘I said to Peter: “I think we’ve won.” I knew Rose had an early shift the next day and didn’t want to wake her up so I decided to ring her first thing and went straight to bed.’

Astonishingly, she slept like a baby. ‘I suppose I was numb really. It hadn’t properly registered. But my husband was up all night flicking between Teletext and the numbers and back again.’

When she did ring Rose, at 6.30 the following morning, her friend didn’t believe it either.

‘All I could think about was I had to get into work as there was only me and one other lady getting the tills ready for opening,’ says Rose. Off she went, popping the winning ticket into her bra for safekeeping.

Kirsty Holmes, at 26 the youngest winner, was similarly shocked. She had moved to work in a different Tesco branch three years before, but carried on paying in.

‘After I’d got the call I remember ringing my dad and he kept saying: “You did pay in didn’t you?” It puts doubt in your mind. I was resisting getting worked up until I could know for sure,’ she says.

All the ladies worked a shift that day. In those early weeks most of them barely spent a penny — not even Rose and Keith with their £4.2 million windfall. ‘I used to draw my husband £40 out the cashpoint every week for petrol and spends,’ Rose says. ‘After we won he still wanted £40, saying he didn’t need any more. I was the same.

‘A few weeks later I even got a call from my bank saying: “It’s your money, Mrs Bradley, you can spend it you know.” And I told them there was nothing that I wanted.’

She even admits to missing work. ‘Not the early starts — I sometimes used to get up at 4.30am — but I missed the people. I still do.’

Eventually, the Bradleys bought a house — upgrading from their semi to a £350,000 four-bedroom bungalow — and a couple of new cars.

They also paid for a ‘fancy bash’ for their daughter’s wedding the following year. The other members were similarly measured. ‘My husband got a BMW, we bought a three-bedroom detached house and I got my eyes lasered — I’d always said that if I had any money I’d get them done, so I did,’ says Sue Harris.

There is, though, the cruising. ‘After our first cruise we never looked back. Now we go four times a year. We’ve seen the world, which we never ever thought we’d do.’

Even by the ladies modest standards though, the Brusbys, who have been married for 47 years and have three grown up children, took caution to the extreme.

‘Peter would happily have sat on it for five years,’ says his wife. ‘I did have to point out that he was in his 60s, I wasn’t far off and that we might as well get on with it.’ They bought a bungalow and upgraded their caravan.

So diamonds and designer handbags came there none — the rather smart Louis Vuitton I spy on the arm of Elaine Leason, 54, only materialised six years after her win on the insistence of her 24-year-old daughter, who said she should treat herself to mark her 50th birthday.

Happy: Top row, Kirsty Holmes, Sue Harris and Sue Brusby. Bottom row, Rose Bradley and Elaine Leason

Her only diamonds, meanwhile, have come in the form of a DIY tile cutter that Rob bought her for a birthday recently. ‘I did ask for something with diamonds in it and apparently there’s a diamond in the trimmer. I still didn’t speak to him for a bit though,’ she says.

Even Kirsty, the youngster of the group, was a model of probity: in the months after pocketing £2.8 million her only serious spending was paying off her £70,000 mortgage.

She also carried on her work at the Tesco checkout and only left following comments that she was taking work from someone who might need the money.

She admits she struggled to know what to do with herself when she stopped working. So she flew to South Africa and spent a year volunteering in schools.

She met Chris, 41, a painter and decorator, on her return, and the couple married five years ago. As a single lady in possession of a Lottery fortune, how could she know his intentions were honourable?

‘Of course, you wonder what people are thinking when they meet you. It helped that I knew him through friends. Ultimately you just have to trust your instincts.’ These days the money helps her be a stay-at-home mum to their three children while Chris goes out to work.

Time for the million-pound question: can money buy happiness? It comes as no surprise that they all resolutely shake their heads.

‘I lost Dad two years ago and I would give it all away in a heartbeat if it meant having him back,’ says Sue Harris.’

Rose adds: ‘We were happy before all this. It’s about the people you’re surrounded by — children, grandchildren. And your health.’
