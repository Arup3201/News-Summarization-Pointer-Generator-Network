Manu Tuilagi is a major doubt for the World Cup after it emerged the England and Leicester star is unlikely to play again this season.

The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster’s team-sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester.

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘Manu is improving but it is a long process. The likelihood is, he may not play this season. He may or may not play this season.’

Fears that Tuilagi's groin injury is worse than first feared were confirmed by his club Leicester 

The 23-year-old, who Mailsport understands is suffering from the notoriously troublesome condition known as ‘Gilmore’s Groin’, is now likely to have just three warm-up matches this summer to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup, which kicks off on September 18.

Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on.

In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations.

As it transpired, he played no role in tournament, although he did spend time with England’s medical team and remains a valued member of the squad. But serious questions will now be asked about the management of his injury after surgery was delayed in a bid to get him fit.

England had better news last night when Saracens confirmed injured duo Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt as expected to return in the next two to three weeks.
