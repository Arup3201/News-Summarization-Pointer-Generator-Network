Steven Gerrard’s move to LA Galaxy will be finalised in the next 24 hours.

The 34-year-old Liverpool captain has agreed an 18-month contract, worth £3.9million a year, to move to California and will start playing in the MLS when their mid-season transfer window opens in July.

The Reds skipper was out in Liverpool city centre at Secret nightclub on Tuesday night to celebrate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday.

Steven Gerrard won't be the first Premier League star to join LA Galaxy.

David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier featured both in England and America for LA Galaxy.

Gerrard and his team-mates were joined by manager Brendan Rodgers for the night out as the Liverpool squad appeared in high spirits following Monday night's 2-1 victory over Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round.

Summer signings Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno and Rickie Lambert were also in attendance along with defenders Glen Johnson, Luis Enrique, Javier Manquillo. 

Gerrard revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East.

Most significantly, though, he revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England.

When he ended his England career after the World Cup, it was with the intention of committing to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until last November.

‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool.

‘I didn’t want my club games to be tailored. My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season.

‘It is all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it.

‘There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool FC have been unbelievable for me since I was eight. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams.’  

Manager Rodgers had wanted to keep Gerrard at Anfield and the iconic midfielder insisted again that the decision to part was amicable; he made his decision after Rodgers revealed he would be tailoring his game time next season.

Such is Gerrard’s quality, though, his availability alerted a number of clubs, with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, for one, expressing his admiration.

But Gerrard said: ‘I had a lot of offers — domestically, from Europe, Asia and America.

‘When I decided the time was right to leave Liverpool, I knew straight away I wouldn’t ever sign for another domestic club or anyone in Europe.

‘I never wanted to find myself in the situation where I was coming back to play against Liverpool. Even if I went somewhere else in Europe I’d be running that risk in terms of the European competitions.

‘Also, I said to myself that if you want to play for a big team in Europe with a great coach then I may as well stay put as I had all that here already.

‘That wouldn’t have been the change I was looking for. The attraction of America was a different lifestyle, a different culture for myself and my family.’ 

AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa believes Liverpool will struggle without Gerrard 

Gerrard was Liverpool’s star in their FA Cup win over AFC Wimbledon on Monday. The man who tormented Gerrard’s defensive team-mates that night, Adebayo Akinfenwa, believes they will miss their captain.

‘To lose him, boy, I don’t know the future, but it will be a problem,’ said Akinfenwa, who rattled his beloved Reds with an equaliser before Gerrard’s winner.

‘You can see he was the difference. If he didn’t play, it would have been a different story. He was miles better than anybody on the pitch.

‘Sometimes when you play against people you can just use the word “class”. That’s what it is. Two moments of magic won the game.

‘He is the difference and Liverpool will lose that. I don’t want to see him go. Not just as a Liverpool supporter but as a lover of football. He will be a massive miss.’

Akinfenwa swapped shirts with Gerrard after the final whistle. ‘I just spoke to him quickly,’ he said. ‘I was like: “I’m a fan, please don’t go, man." He just smiled. If he needs to go to pastures new, so be it. All you can do is wish him on his merry way and hope he comes back as manager one day.’

The mantle of being Liverpool’s next iconic player is up for grabs and the man most likely to fill it is Raheem Sterling. He missed Monday’s win after being given time away from the club by Rodgers.

Sterling returned to Jamaica after the 2-2 draw with Leicester but is expected to be back in contention for Saturday’s trip to Sunderland.

Raheem Sterling is currently in Jamaica but is expected to face Sunderland at the weekend
