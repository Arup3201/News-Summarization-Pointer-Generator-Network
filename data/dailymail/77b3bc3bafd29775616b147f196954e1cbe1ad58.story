Footage has been unearthed which shows Science fiction author Sir Arthur C Clarke thought Russia would land the first man on the moon in 1968.

The late 2001: A Space Odyssey author made his space race forecast in 1961, even predicting  Russia would set foot on the moon on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution.

Previously thought to be lost, the BBC interview shows Clarke chatting to friend TV astronomer Sir Patrick Moore in an episode of The Sky at Night, the world's longest running television science programme.

Predictions: Arthur C Clarke, pictured here in 1974, said the Russians would win the space race

In the interview in 1963 it had been two years since the Russians got the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin, in April 1961, but it was the Americans who would disprove his theory and get to the moon first.

It was thought the broadcast had vanished, but it has just been discovered in a television station archive in Africa by collectors looking for lost episodes of Doctor Who.

The grainy footage shows Clarke predicted the Americans would lag behind the Russians and reach the moon just two years later.

Landing: Although Arthur C Clarke predicted Russia would be first to land on the moon, he did get the date almost right as Neil Armstrong and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin (pictured) landed in 1969

And he wasn’t far wrong with his prediction of: 'Around 1970, if you want to pin me down.’

It was 1969 when Neil Armstrong put his left foot on to the surface of the moon.

He said: 'The American moon project is a colossal thing, costing $10m a day. I believe they will succeed in getting a man on the moon – and back again, which is equally important – not before 1970, but it will not be much after that.'

After seeing the film of the interview again after almost half a century, Moore told the Guardian: 'We got some right, some not so right. I don't think we did too badly.'

The film was discovered in an African television archive by one of an eccentric gang of collectors. Their prime target is lost episodes of Doctor Who, but they recognised the exceptional rarity of the 1963 The Sky at Night interview.

The collector, who bought it from the archive sent it back, still in its original film can, as a gift to the current The Sky at Night production team.

Footage from the reel will be shown in December's The Sky at Night programme next week.

Discovering the footage was incredibly moving for Moore as it is the only record of the only programme which he and friend Clarke made live together in a studio.

Although he did interview Clarke again, it was through filmed inserts or taped phone interviews.

The British science fiction author, inventor and futurist died in his adoptive homeland of Sri Lanka in 2008 aged 90.
