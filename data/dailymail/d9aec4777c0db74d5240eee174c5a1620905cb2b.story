In the red corner, a high-profile news presenter known for his Left-wing opinions and colourful ties.

In the blue, a Yorkshire-based MP very much to the Right of the Tory party.

And as Jon Snow became embroiled in a furious shouting match with Philip Davies, the Channel 4 newsroom turned into their unlikely sparring arena.

The row – played out in front of 50 journalists – began when ‘playground bully’ Mr Snow confronted Mr Davies, who was on a tour of the studio, about accusations of political bias.

Backbench Tory MP Philip Davies was involved in a heated exchange with veteran broadcaster Jon Snow on a tour of Channel 4 News's studios yesterday

They traded insults for ten minutes – with Mr Davies saying Mr Snow was ‘past it’ – before fellow presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy waded in and told their visitor to ‘clear off’.

As the dust settled last night, each side blamed the other for the undignified scene.

Mr Snow’s colleagues claimed he had acted ‘perfectly reasonably’ after being subjected to a ‘personal attack’ from the politician.

According to witnesses, he argued with Mr Davies over accusations the MP had made that he was ‘biased’ to the Left.

Mr Davies, a long-serving member of the Commons culture committee, accused the 67-year-old presenter of subjecting him to an unprovoked verbal assault.

The MP said he had been visiting ITN – where Channel 4 News is made – to discuss digital media and Google’s ‘right to be forgotten’ policy with its chief executive John Hardie. He was then invited to take a tour of the premises, when he bumped into Mr Snow in the middle of the busy newsroom.

Mr Davies said: ‘He launched into a tirade of abuse about something I had said in a select committee about Channel 4 News being Left-wing and biased, and that Jon Snow was a prime example of it.

‘He said, “Just give me one example where I’ve been biased, just one example”. I replied, “I’m on a tour round, I haven’t come for an argument about Channel 4 News. I will happily do that but I haven’t come expecting confrontation”.

‘He went on, “Where are your examples? You can’t give me any examples”. He was like a playground bully in his own playground.’ Yesterday, another source who was at the scene also said Mr Snow had started the exchange.

Mr Davies said Tuesday’s row escalated when he suggested the presenter was getting too old for his job. According to one witness, he told Mr Snow: ‘I think it’s time you retired’.

Under rules set by watchdog Ofcom, Channel 4 must report the news accurately and with ‘due impartiality’.

However, like the BBC, it has been accused of giving prominence to liberal viewpoints, and its presenters have been criticised for aligning themselves too closely with the Left.

This summer Jon Snow came under fire after he recorded a YouTube video - filmed in the Channel 4 studios - in which he gave a personal reflection on the conflict in Gaza.

Some said he was guilty of bias against Israel after he focused his report exclusively on the children killed in the bombardment.

He was also criticised for a tweet in which he said there was an ‘awful danger’ that the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine would ‘provide cover for an intensification of Israel’s ground war in Gaza’.

In 2008, a group of Roman Catholic priests accused the channel of being biased towards Islam and taking a ‘trivialising attitude to Catholicism’.

In reply, Mr Snow suggested the MP was struggling to hold on to his constituency of Shipley in West Yorkshire. In fact Mr Davies beat his Labour rival by 9,944 votes at the last election, up from his majority of 422 votes in 2005.

Mr Davies said: ‘Much to the embarrassment of the ITN people I said, “Look John, pack it in, you’re past it”. And he said, “Well good luck with your 400 majority”.

‘And I said, “That goes to show, you’re out of date and past it”.’

It was at that point Mr Guru-Murthy entered the fray, apparently telling Mr Davies: ‘If you’re going to start getting personal on Jon Snow, I think you should clear off.’

Mr Davies has several times accused Channel 4 of bias. In 2010, he said the broadcaster was so obsessed with diversity that white people were under-represented in its workforce.

And during a select committee hearing last year he grilled chief executive David Abraham and chairman Lord Burns about perceived liberal bias in its news output.

At the time, he asked: ‘Do you think Jon Snow conceals his political allegiances? Do you? Are you going to sit there with a straight face and say that?’

Lord Burns conceded: ‘I think that Jon would probably fall into the liberal bias category that you described, and if you were in any doubt, you could just follow his Twitter feed on a regular basis.’

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘We were pleased to welcome Philip Davies MP to Channel 4 News. Our journalists never shy away from a full and frank discussion, and Jon Snow and Mr Davies had a robust exchange of views.’
