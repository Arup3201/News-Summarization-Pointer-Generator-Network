A dozy drug dealer was caught when police found a photo on his phone of him wearing a crown made of 20 pound notes and a bag of cannabis hanging from his mouth.

Ayub Hagos, from Abbey Wood, London, was arrested after officers searched a flat in Southsea, Hampshire last October and found a haul of drugs and cash.

The 19-year-old denied having anything to do with the drugs until police took a look at his phone and discovered a gallery of photos of cash, guns, knives and white powder.

Incriminating photo: Ayub Hagos poses with wads of £20 notes, a crown made from cash and a bag of cannabis in his mouth

He pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a class A drug with intent to supply and was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Portsmouth Crown Court on Friday.

Police who raided the flat found 23 wraps of crack cocaine, with a street value of £920, 11 wraps of heroin, worth £440, a knuckle-duster and 500 pounds cash in his bag.

Hagos was alleged to have travelled from his home in London to the south coast to sell the drugs.

Caught red-handed: Hagos also had a picture on his phone of him admiring his drugs with a pile of cash on his lap

During his trial, Hagos' barrister Alexander Thompson told the court he had been naive.

Mr Thompson said: 'He took the photographs as bravado to make himself seem more important in front of his peers.

'It is incredibly naive for a sophisticated drug dealer to have these sort of photographs on his phone.'

Prosecutor Matthew Lawson said: 'The crown would certainly say it is an overwhelming case.

'The photographs are such that the defendant would have had difficulty in disassociating himself with the drugs.'

The court heard he had previous convictions for possessing cannabis and assault.

Sentencing him, Judge Richard Price said: 'You came down from London with class A drugs, crack cocaine and heroin, to sell in this city.

'I am satisfied that is the sole purpose of your visit to this city.

'You are more than a street dealer, you are a supplier to those who sell on the streets.

'I’m entirely satisfied that in all the circumstances of this case you played a significant role.'
