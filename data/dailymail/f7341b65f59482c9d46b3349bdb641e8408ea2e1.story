Children who watch cartoons on the internet are just a few clicks away from viewing graphic explicit content, a worrying survey has found.

A study of 24,000 school children found that graphic footage was available to children who had viewed clips of popular shows like Peppa Pig and Sesame Street.

Young YouTube users were three clicks away from footage of a woman giving birth after viewing a Sesame Street video, the 'Have Your Say' research, conducted by online security company Kaspersky, found.

Exposure to 'mean comments' is a common trend; 31 per cent of primary school children and 23 per cent of secondary school children said they have been affected

The list of recommended videos, displayed on the right-hand side of the page after a video has shown, provided a path to the explicit material, the  Guardian reported.

The survey found that 27 per cent of 
seven to 11-year-olds and 41 per cent of 11 to 19-yeard-olds had viewed 
'hurtful or unpleasant' content, including 'scary videos, pictures and 
chainmail; rude things and swearing; violent films or games'.

The study, commissioned by the UK Safer Internet Centre to mark Safer Internet Day, found 86 per cent of primary school children use some form of online communication tool while 96 per cent secondary age children are prolific online users.

The research also revealed that education about privacy settings was still in demand.

Over a third (35 per cent) of 7-year-olds and almost half (45 per cent) of 16 to 19 year-olds say they have not been taught about staying safe online.

Edward Timpson, Minister for Children and Families said: 'We know how important it is that young people are safe and supported while using the internet, and that parents are confident their children are protected from accessing harmful content.

'We have already taken great strides to make internet access more family friendly and we will continue to work with the industry, parents and young people to build an even safer internet in the future.'

Will Gardner, Chief Spokesperson for the UK Safer Internet Centre, said: 'In our research young people clearly stated that they should have the right to feel safe online and they also recognise they have a responsibility in helping themselves and others be safe online, whether that's behaving kindly towards others or helping friends who are experiencing problems.

'We are delighted that so many young people have taken the opportunity of the survey to get their voice heard, and we hope it will act as a catalyst for encouraging individuals, families and companies to think about their role in ensuring the Internet is a great and safe place for children.'
