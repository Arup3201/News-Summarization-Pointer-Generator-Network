Thousands of London bus workers have voted to go on strike in a row over extra payments for working during the Olympic Games.

Members of the Unite union backed 
industrial action by more than nine to one, raising the prospect of 
crippling walkouts during the Games, which start in the capital next 
month.

The union wants a payment of £500 for 
each of the 20,000 bus workers it represents in London, pointing out 
that other transport employees are being paid a premium for being on 
duty during the event.

Protest: London bus drivers demonstrate outside 
the offices of Transport for London last month. They have now voted in favour of strike action

The union will decide in the coming days whether to name strike dates following the ballot result.

Unite has previously warned that 
'strike action could take place up to and during the Olympic Games', 
which last from July 27 to August 12.

Any strike action during the Olympics 
threatens travel disruption on an unprecedented scale, with London's 
public transport network expected to face an extra three million daily 
journeys.

As 10,500 athletes, 9,000 officials, 
20,000 journalists and millions of spectators descend on 13 sporting 
sites - as well as normal Londoners continuing to go about their daily 
business - the whole of the London's transport infrastructure will be 
needed to keep the capital moving.

Transport for London (TfL) said the 
union was demanding a £500 'bonus' for each of the 24,000 bus drivers in
London for working during the London 2012 Games.

But TfL maintains bus drivers are 
employed by private companies and that their pay and conditions are a 
matter for those private companies.

'Reprehensible': Bus drivers want an extra £500 pounds each for 
working during the games - arguing they will have to cope with an extra 
800,000 passengers

Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director 
of surface transport, said: 'I am not surprised that 70 per cent of 
London's bus drivers did not vote for strike action. That is because 
about 70 per cent of London's local bus services are not affected by the
Olympic Games.

'The whole country is really entering 
into the spirit of the Games and the overwhelming responsible majority 
are pulling out all the stops to make it a huge success.

'Only Unite appears to want to exploit
it by adding a further multi-million pound burden to the hard-pressed 
farepayers and taxpayers of London.

'We are really disappointed that the Unite leadership is encouraging its members to take this unnecessary strike action.

'Unite has already negotiated binding 
deals for pay and conditions with each of the London bus companies for 
this year and those companies are keeping their end of the deal.

'Attempting to tear up those 
agreements and get a new one with less than 50 days to go before the 
Games is completely reprehensible and out-of-step with every other 
provider of services in this city this summer.'

up to the 21 private companies that run bus services across London as 
they set staff pay

Unite said it was giving the bus 
companies a final opportunity to consider the 'landslide' ballot result 
before announcing possible strike dates early next week.

The union said bus workers were the 
only London transport employees not receiving an award for their extra 
effort during the Olympic Games.

At least 800,000 extra passengers are predicted to use London's buses during the Olympics, said Unite.

Regional officer Peter Kavanagh, said: 'There are only seven weeks until the Olympics and the whole world is watching London.

'It's a disgrace that London's mayor, Boris Johnson, and the bus companies have allowed this dispute to get this far.

'Our members are only asking for an 
extra £17 a day which will just about buy you a pint of beer and a 
portion of fish and chips at the Olympics.

'Our members want the Games to be a success but their patience has run out.

'We have given Transport for London 
and the bus operators almost a year to resolve this issue. Every single 
London transport worker in London will receive a reward to recognise 
their major contribution to this historic occasion except for London's 
bus workers.

'It is time for TfL and the bus companies to consider this landslide vote in favour of strike action and resolve this dispute.

'This dispute could be brought to an 
end now if the bus companies and TfL have the will to provide the 
relatively small amount of money compared to the billions being spent on
the Games.'

Salaries for London bus drivers range from around £11,000 to £23,500 a year, but they can earn more with overtime.
