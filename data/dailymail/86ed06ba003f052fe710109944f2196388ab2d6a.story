The British father who has admitted to cutting the throats of his two young children was seen buying sweets, bread and drinks in a bakery with his son and daughter just hours before the double killing. 

Julian Stevenson, 48, was arrested on 
Saturday after the bodies of son Mathew, 10, and daughter Carla, five, 
were found in his apartment in a suburb of Lyon, eastern France.

The shop owner, who asked not to be named, said: 'Mr Stevenson came into the shop on Saturday lunchtime with his two children.

'They seemed happy and he bought them sweets. There didn't appear to be anything wrong. He also bought a baguette.

'We see a lot of him here. He is friendly with my staff and always talks to the servers.

'I know hundreds of people, everybody comes here to buy their bread, but I remember Mr Stevenson because of his accent.

'This tragic incident has shocked everybody. He always appeared to be a good dad and a caring father.'

Earlier on Saturday, Stevenson took 
his family to a McDonald's restaurant close to his home, and the 
children were seen in the play area.

A manager at the fast food restaurant
said: 'The family were here on Saturday. The father came here with his 
two children at about 11am. They stayed for about an hour.'

The manager said detectives have 
since visited the restaurant to question staff. 'The police were here 
for three hours interviewing everyone,' she said.

'They took away CCTV footage as part of their investigation.'

The 48-year-old is said to have carried out the double-murder in a fit of rage before fleeing on a pair of roller-skates.

Yesterday
Stevenson had his head covered by a blue blanket as he was driven into 
an underground car park beneath Lyon's main criminal court complex in an
unmarked police Renault Laguna.

The hand-cuffed defendant sat next to a
plain-clothed detective in the back seat of the car, as armed officers 
also sat in front. An accompanying patrol car had its blue lights 
flashing.

Stevenson was then led into a closed 
hearing at the Tribunal de Grande Instance where the allegations against
him were formally read out.

'Homicides' translates to 'murder scene' on the note attached to the apartment door

Prosecutors say they were 'not 
currently' charging Mr Stevenson with premeditated murder, suggesting 
that he may plead diminished responsibility. 

A judicial source said: 'We are presently holding back from the charge of premeditated murder but this could always change.'

The source said all the circumstances surrounding the horrific crime would be investigated over many months.

Neighbours of Stevenson said he 
had appeared 'calm and relaxed' as he wandered around the St Priest 
suburb of Lyon with the two children on Saturday morning.

'It was a warm day and he was in 
T-shirt and long shorts,' said one. 'The children were smiling happily, 
and appeared to be enjoying a day out with their dad.

'He was buying them little presents, including sweets, and did not appear in the least bit flustered.'

Stephanies, Stevenson's French 
ex-wife, had handed over the children on Friday evening, and they spent a
night in the old family home in Saint-Priest, around three miles from 
the city centre.

This was despite Stevenson being a 
heavy drinker, and having been violent towards his wife before their 
divorce up to three years ago.

When Mrs Stevenson, an accountant's 
assistant also in her 40s, returned to pick up the children from the 
second floor apartment at around 5pm on Saturday she saw Stevenson 
looking 'panicked and angry', according to a neighbour.

'He was in the stairwell of the block,
and his clothes were covered in blood,' said the neighbour. 'He made 
off on a pair of roller-skates, leaving his car in the apartment block's
garage.'

Following a short manhunt, Stevenson was found in Lyon's 8th arrondissement at around 8pm on the same evening.

A judicial source said that a knife which was thought to be the murder weapon had been found in the flat.

The source said the double murder was 
'clearly linked to a painful separation' and 'legal procedures 
concerning the right to access to the children which the father deemed 
insufficient.'

In 2010, Stevenson had attacked his then wife, leading to these rights of access being withdrawn.

This was the first weekend since then 
that Stevenson had been allowed to have the boy and girl with him 
without an adult third party.

The Lyon prosecuting source said Stevenson 'admitted being the murderer' but 'did not give many more details.'

Stevenson has been living in France 
for 10 years and married in 2005. His wife was finally heard by 
prosecutors on Sunday, providing them with their details of her troubled
relationship with her ex-husband.

Investigators were particularly keen to know who gave the father legal authority to look after the children.

Ahmed Benguedda, a former neighbour of the couple said the couple had divorced 'two or three years ago.'

Stevenson, who is unemployed, had 
drinking problems and was violent towards his wife, Mr Benguedda, who 
still lives locally, confirmed.

She won custody of the children 
following the divorce and went to live in the Isere region of France, 
which is just to the south east of Lyon and an easy drive or train 
journey away.

Mr Benguedda said the children were 
'well-balanced' and often played with his seven-year-old daughter. 'The 
people who live here are all in a state of shock,' he added.

A Foreign Office spokesman said the 
matter was being investigated. 'We are aware of the reports and we are 
urgently looking into them,' said a spokesman.
