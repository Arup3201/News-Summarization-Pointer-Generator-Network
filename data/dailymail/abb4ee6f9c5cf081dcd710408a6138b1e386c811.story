The Duchess of Cambridge is celebrating her 32nd birthday today in private the palace has announced.

As a mother of a five-month-old baby it is unlikely the Duchess will be revelling into the small hours, but at least this year she will be able to indulge in a glass or two off champagne on her big day, having been pregnant on her last birthday. 

Though it is not known what the Duchess will be doing to mark her first birthday as a parent, it is likely the family-orientated royal will spend the day with husband William, who has just started a bespoke course at Cambridge University, at their Kensington Palace apartment.

A truly momentous year: This year will doubtless be etched forever into Kate and William's memory as both became parents for the first time on July 22

The hands-on mother will also likely involve Prince George in any celebrations she chooses to have, though it is not yet known if Kate’s own parents, who she is very close to, will see their daughter today.

The past 12 months have been a life changing period for Kate who gave birth to Prince George in the summer.

Her baby son was christened in front of the Queen, Prince of Wales and other members of the immediate family in October and she has also begun to take on solo royal engagements this year.

But after such an eventful year, a simple romantic birthday meal at home could be on the cards for Kate who was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, on January 9 1982.

Kate and husband William recently moved into their Kensington Palace apartment and an intimate dinner could be held at the picturesque royal residence.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said that Kate would be spending her birthday 'privately'.

This is in keeping with the couple, who were careful to keep their relationship as private as possible when they were dating at St Andrews University in Scotland, before marrying in April 2011.

William began an agricultural management course at Cambridge University on Monday and may spend much of Kate's birthday studying at the famous university, or catching up on the long list of reading expected of Cambridge students.

The Duke is commuting a number of days a week to attend the course run by the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership.

William was admitted to the prestigious institution for a 'bespoke' course in agricultural management, which will prepare him for when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the biggest private estates in the country, from his father.

Despite a jam packed year, Kate has stepped up to her royal duties, attending numerous charity events, such as meeting the Royal British Legion Poppy sellers in Kensington in November

But while William has been preparing for his role as full time royal, his wife too has had a busy year 

As the Queen reduces the number of public engagements she attends, the younger royals, and Kate and Wills in particular, are increasingly stepping forward to fill the gaps.

The 87-year-old monarch conducted 341 official events this year, compared to 425 in 2012 - a drop of about 20 per cent.

Despite being pregnant for much of the year, Kate has managed to attend numerous events and premieres, finding time to support her chosen charities and support her husband.

Kate also stunned the public with springing back to shape astonishingly quickly after the birth of Prince George in July.

The Duchess' enviably flat stomach was revealed to the world when she played volleyball in Olympic Park for charity SportsAid in October.

It is understood the Duchess got back her trim figure through long walks with her dog, Lupo, and the odd burst on a rowing machine. She also took part in ante-natal yoga classes, which are believed to help new mothers regain their figure afterwards by ‘training’ their muscles to snap back into shape.
