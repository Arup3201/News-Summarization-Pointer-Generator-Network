The yacht Notorious has lived up to its name.

The famed water vessel that was once owned by Randolph Hearst, President Gerald Ford and even Charlton Heston while he was filming the classic movie Planet of the Apes, was destroyed in a fire on Wednesday as it was being stored ashore in Huntsville, Alabama.

This after the ship had to removed from the water as it was sinking and taking on water last August.

The vessel was moved out of the water in August as it had begun to partially sink

Authorities are still not sure what caused the fire as it sat at Ditto Landing awaiting repairs

Investigators still aren't sure how exactly the fire started, and if it was accidental or intentional, as it sat at Ditto Landing awaiting repairs.

The 78-foot 1953 Feadship motor yacht was also once owned by a mob boss according to WHNT. 

It is said there is even a secret passageway somewhere on the vessel.  

It was previously reported the owner, who has not been named but may be Stuart Snyder, had been spending the past few years trying to restore the yacht, which they hoped would be worth upwards of $1million when complete. 

The owner had also spent months looking for the perfect marina.

President Gerald Ford owned the archetypal 78-foot vessel around the time it was first built in the 50s
