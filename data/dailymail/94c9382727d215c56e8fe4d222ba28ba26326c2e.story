Besiktas' players will not fear Arsenal in their make-or-break Champions League play-off second leg at the Emirates, according to manager Slaven Bilic.

The former Croatia boss will be missing from the touchline on Wednesday night after being sent to the stands during last week's 0-0 draw in Turkey.

But he believes his side have taken confidence from that result and will relish the opportunity to dump out Arsene Wenger's side in north London.

Confident: Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic believes his players are ready to knock out Arsenal at the Emirates

Preparation: Besiktas' players train at the Emirates stadium on Tuesday evening

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday evening, Bilic said: 'We showed from our performance in the first leg that we are capable of giving them a game. We played well.

'We had our chances and they had theirs. We were not totally happy with the result as I think we deserved to win, but we go into this game full of confidence.

'I was confident and my staff were confident before the first game. But maybe some of our players had a little bit of doubt because they had not played against those so-called "big guns".

'But after the game they were very confident, which I don't mind as long as you do not become big-headed.'

Belief: Bilic claims his players, such as Veli Kavlak (centre), have a plan to come out on top

Despite an encouraging performance in Istanbul, Besiktas go into the return leg as underdogs to reach the group stage of the Champions League.

Bilic admits his side will need to be at their best to come out on top, but he believes they are well prepared to do just that despite his touchline ban.

'We are not the favourites. They are the favourites – they are Arsenal – but we have a dream, a hope,' he said.

'It's more of a plan, though, and we are going to do everything we can to fulfil it. We have prepared our game, our plan. I have big belief in my assistants and they are going to do the job.'
