Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to have had his most successful financial year since leaving office

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to have had his most successful year financially since leaving office.

Mr Blair is thought to have more than £13 million in the bank after a 'bumper' year for his business interests.

Companies House figures for the year to April 2013 show that one of the companies he owns made a £2 million profit during the period.

A City of London accountant told The Sunday Telegraph the 'bumper' figures showed Mr Blair had had his 'best year yet'.

The analysis is based on the accounts of two companies, Windrush Ventures Limited and Firerush Ventures Limited, which were set up after he left Downing Street. Both fall under Tony Blair Associates.

Windrush, which is thought to channel money for his Government Advisory Practice, had a turnover of £14.9 million, with an after-tax profit of £2 million.

Firerush, a smaller company which administers funding for the former Prime Minister's work advising sovereign wealth funds and companies, had cash at the bank and in hand up from £1.2 million in the previous financial year to £4.6 million.

The companies together had cash of £13.4 million and shareholder funds worth £7 million.

Mr Blair, who has an estimated wealth of £70 million, advises JP Morgan and Zurich International as well as countries including Kazakhstan and Mongolia. He also runs two global charities.

A statement on his website, The Office of Tony Blair, said: ‘These are the financial statements of the two companies through which the operating costs of the Tony Blair group's global activities are paid.

‘They do not represent his earnings or the earnings or the profit of his businesses and are not referable to them.’

It added: ‘The money made by Mr Blair from the Windrush and Firerush businesses is not published in these accounts; it is though, subject to full personal income tax     

‘Mr Blair continues to be a UK taxpayer and pays full personal tax on all his earnings worldwide.’
