An incredible natural-colour image of Saturn, taken from space, shows the planet’s moons and rings as well as Earth, Venus and Mars all together for the first time.

The image was taken by Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which shows the view as it would be seen by human eyes.

Cassini’s imaging team processed 141 wide-angle images to create the impressive panorama.

An incredible natural-colour image of Saturn, 
taken from space, shows the planet's moons and rings as well as Earth, 
Venus and Mars all together for the first time. The image was taken by 
Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which shows the view as it would be seen by 
human eyes

The picture, which was unveiled at the Newseum in Washington today, takes in 404,880 miles across Saturn and its inner ring system, including its striking rings out of the E ring, which is the planet’s outer-most ring.

To give an idea of the vast scale of the image, Nasa said the distance between Earth and our moon would fit comfortably inside the span of the E ring.

It is possible to see Earth as a bright blue dot to the lower right of Saturn, while Venus is a bright dot to Saturn’s upper left. Mars also makes an appearance as a faint red dot, above and to the left of Venus.

Curiously the image makes it look as if the planets are in the wrong order in the Solar System, but it is a trick of perspective.

A total of seven of Saturn’s moons are also visible, including Enceladus on the left side of the image. Cassini even captured the icy plume emanating from the moon’s south pole, which supplies fine, powder-sized icy particles that make up the E ring.

Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004.

On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year.

Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer.

Cassini has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the theory of relativity

Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013.

The E ring shimmers like a halo around Saturn and the inner rings and is best seen with light shining from behind it so that the tiny particles are outlined with light because of the science of diffraction, Nasa's scientists explained.

‘In this one magnificent view, Cassini has delivered to us a universe of marvels,’ said Carolyn Porco, Cassini's imaging team lead at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

‘And it did so on a day people all over the world, in unison, smiled in celebration at the sheer joy of being alive on a pale blue dot.’

The professional mosaic forms part of Cassini’s ‘Wave at Saturn’ campaign, which on July 19, encouraged people to find Saturn in their part of the sky and wave at it, sharing pictures over the internet.

Scientists examining Saturn’s rings use computers to dramatically increase the contrast of the images and change the colour so they can see material tracing out the orbits of tiny moons, such as Anthe and Methone, for the first time.

‘The
E ring in particular shows patterns that likely reflect disturbances 
from such diverse sources as sunlight and Enceladus’ gravity,’ she added.

The
reason why Cassini does not attempt many images of Earth, is because 
the sun is so close to our planet that an unobstructed view would damage
the spacecraft's sensitive detectors.

This fun collage includes about 1,600 images submitted by members of the public as part of the campaign

Matt Hedman, a Cassini participating 
scientist at the University of Idaho in Moscow, said: ‘This mosaic 
provides a remarkable amount of high-quality data on Saturn’s diffuse 
rings, revealing all sorts of intriguing structures we are currently 
trying to understand.

The team had to look for an opportunity when the sun would slip behind Saturn from Cassini’s point of view to get the shot.

That opportunity arrived on July 19, when
Cassini was able to capture a picture of Earth and its moon, as well as
this multi-image, backlit panorama of the Saturn system.

In addition to taking images, Nasa's Cassini spacecraft has a mass spectrometer on-board to look at the composition of atmosphere. It recently examined the composition of Titan's atmosphere, to find that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere of the moon

Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ‘With a long, intricate dance around the Saturn system, Cassini aims to study the Saturn system from as many angles as possible.

‘Beyond showing us the beauty of the Ringed Planet, data like these also improve our understanding of the history of the faint rings around Saturn and the way disks around planets form - clues to how our own solar system formed around the sun.’

Launched in 1997, Cassini has explored the Saturn system for more than nine years and will continue to do so until 2017, with the aim of gathering more scientific data, and images of Saturn and its rings and moons.

Images of the lakes near the north pole of Saturn's moon, Titan, pictured, were taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft as it entered its Spring season. This shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of Titan
