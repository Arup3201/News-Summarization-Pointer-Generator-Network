Understanding: Equalities Minister Helen Grant, 50, said in her local newspaper column that she 'sympathised' with families who cannot move or sell

An MP who claimed £20,000 a year for a London flat despite having a £1.8million home in nearby Surrey has complained that she is struggling to sell her house.

Equalities Minister Helen Grant moaned that she has been trying to sell the sprawling pile in Kingswood, near Reigate for two years without success.

In a local newspaper column certain to rile some readers, the Tory MP for Maidstone, Kent, wrote: 'I shudder to think of the effects on the stagnant property market.

'Having tried to sell a house and then buy here in Kent since October 2010, I sympathise with the thousands of others who cannot move or sell.'

It is uncertain whether her sympathy will be returned, after she became embroiled in the expenses row in November for claiming the maximum second-home allowance to cover rent on a London flat.

This was despite the fact that her house is too close to Westminster for her to qualify for the second-home allowance.

Mrs Grant managed to claim it because her Maidstone constituency, which is more than 40 miles from the family home, is outside the expenses ‘exclusion zone’.

The Surrey MP in whose constituency she 
lives – Tory Crispin Blunt – makes the same journey as Mrs Grant into 
the Commons, but is barred from claiming expenses for a second home in London.

Mrs Grant, who was recently reprimanded 
for altering an employee’s contract to cut his sick pay, said she was 
‘fully entitled’ to make the claims.

The 50-year-old, who entered Parliament at the 2010 General Election by winning Ann Widdecombe’s old seat, plans to buy a new home in Kent after selling her Edwardian property.

Developers thinking of buying the lawyer's house have submitted two planning applications to demolish it and replace it with three four-bedroom homes.

The first application was withdrawn 
and the second, for seven apartments and one detached house on the site,
is the subject of an appeal, after it was rejected in July 2012.

Mrs Grant said the property, which sits on a 0.39 hectare site, had been on the market since October 2010.

Plush: The home is worth £1.8million and is in the highly desirable market town of Reigate in Surrey

She added in her column: 'Low or stable rates are at least containing the problem, and that is a coalition success in my book.'

Her controversial expense claims were revealed in a
Channel 4 Dispatches documentary in November, which investigated the 
latest intake of MPs following the row that erupted in 2009.

Mrs Grant, who was the first black 
woman selected to defend a Tory seat, became a Minister in the September
reshuffle when she took on the dual roles of Justice Minister and Women
and Equalities Minister.

Second home: Helen Grant's Thameside flat, beside MI6's headquarters, costs taxpayers £20,000 a year

The
Channel 4 investigation discovered that Mrs Grant, who draws more than 
£26,000 a year from the solicitors’ firm she established in addition to 
her £97,000 pay as MP and Minister, does not have her own home in her 
Kent constituency.

She rents a flat in Vauxhall next to MI6’s headquarters while 
basing herself in Kingswood, 19 miles from Westminster.

When vising her 
constituency in Maidstone and the Weald, she stays at her mother’s home,
in nearby Sutton Valence.

The lawyer, regarded as a fast-rising
Conservative star, has also said she may close her office in Maidstone 
when its lease expires.

She has charged taxpayers the maximum £1,666 a month since starting to rent her Thameside property in March.

A spokesman for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which oversees MPs’ expenses, said in November that Mrs Grant had acted within the rules on second homes.

He added that it was ‘up to MPs to exercise their judgment as to how they claim their expenses’.

A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said: ‘Mrs Grant’s constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency.’

Earlier the same month, her constituency assistant Tony Williams said he was disgusted after she altered his contract to cut his sick pay when he needed time off for a heart condition.

Mr Williams’s contract said he was allowed up to two weeks’ sick pay – instead of the 26 weeks he was entitled to receive.

Mrs Grant claimed the sick pay was docked to give taxpayers a ‘fairer deal’, but the Commons authorities said his contract should not have been altered.
