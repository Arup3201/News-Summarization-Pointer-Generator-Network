A former Playboy Playmate has ditched her lawyer just days before the start of her trial on charges that she tried to smuggle her Canadian boyfriend across the border into New York last summer.

A federal judge in Syracuse granted Colleen Shannon's request on Tuesday to drop her lawyer, Mark Sacco, and gave her two weeks to hire a new one. It's not clear why she wanted new representation.

The 34-year-old Los Angeles resident's trial on illegal immigrant smuggling charges was scheduled to start this week but has now been postponed. A new start date hasn't been set.

Shannon and her boyfriend, Robert Skojo, were arrested in August in Fort Covington, New York, after federal agents said he entered the U.S. illegally by boat through the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation, which straddles the border.

Officials say Skojo has a criminal record in Canada.

Skojo was convicted in Canada in 1990 of 'procuring sexual services' and 'living on the avails of prostitution,' the Post-Standard of Syracuse quotes court papers as saying. He was also convicted of drug charges in 1996 and 1999.

Skojo began dating Shannon in 2011 after she DJ'd a party he hosted, according to the Post-Standard.

The 2004 playmate, who now works as a disc jockey, was taken into custody after being charged with violating a federal statute prohibiting 'bringing in and harboring aliens'.

U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped Shannon on August 15 at the Massena point of entry, where she'd driven alone in Skojo's 2005 Bentley, court documents said.

The newspaper reported that Shannon 
declared that she had $9,800 in cash with her, which she said was from 
her job as a DJ, but she couldn't prove Skojo had given permission to 
drive his car.

Shannon told the agents she was an actress and that she was driving to New York City to meet her agent.

Border Patrol let her go, then notified agents with Homeland Security Investigations.

Agents watched her drive to a hotel in Fort Covington hotel and Skojo met her there that night, the papers said.

The couple were arrested arrested the next morning.

Shannon claims she shouldn't be charged with alien smuggling because she didn't drive Skojo across the border.

'Instead, according to Shannon, she was simply picking up her boyfriend,' the prosecutor's court papers said.

The former playmate faces 10 years in prison if convicted.

In her 2004 Playboy profile, Shannon, who is from Alaska, said she was turned-on by 'positivity and supportiveness' while turn-offs included negativity and being a bad kisser. 

She said: 'Everyone is put here to do something. Your subconscious tells you the things that you love to do, but a lot of people put those things aside.

'I think if you stick to things you love, nine times out of ten, circumstances are going to go your way and you will live a happy life.'
