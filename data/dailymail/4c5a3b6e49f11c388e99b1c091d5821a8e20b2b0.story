A Sudanese-born man accused along with his twin brother and two teenage boys of gang raping a 16-year-old girl near a council library in south-western Sydney has walked free on bail.

Hassan Kugor, 20, is charged with his brother, Hussein, and two unnamed boys of luring the teenager girl from outside the Liverpool Council Library to a car park on a Saturday night in June last year.

The girl was using the council's free wifi at around 9pm on June 31, 2014, when the group of six young men of African appearance approached and struck up a conversation with her. 

Sudanese-born twin brothers Hassan and Hussein Kugor, 20, are accused with other young men of luring a 16-year-old girl from outside Liverpool Library (pictured) last June to a nearby car park stairwell where she was raped and robbed of her mobile phone

They allegedly invited her to meet up with a mutual acquaintance and lured her to the nearby council car park stairwell, where two of the males raped her. 

Two of the young men were just 16 years old. The gang stole the young woman's mobile phone, forcing the traumatised teenager to return to the library’s forecourt and notify a bystander.

A month later, police charged Hassan Kugor and the two teenage boys with aggravated sexual assault and robbery in company.

Kugor denies sexually assaulting the teenager, but on Tuesday the NSW Supreme Court heard that DNA evidence relating to him formed part of a strong prosecution brief  in what Justice David Davies said was 'a shocking case'.

Crown prosecutors opposed bail, arguing there were concerns Kugor would reoffend and that he posed a risk to the safety of the victim and the community.

Kugor's father offered a $5000 surety for his son, who will live while on bail with a middle-aged family friend at Blacktown in western Sydney, and adhere to a nightly curfew between 8pm and 6am, avoid the victim, his five co-accused and the Liverpool area, except for legal visits.

The court heard he had strong community ties, a partner of several years and a seven-month-old son.

'He has a minimal criminal history,' Justice Davies said.

Kugor, who has been in custody since July, is due to appear with his brother at Liverpool Local Court on February 11.
