Chinese families are hiring out-of-work actors to cry at funerals when relatives are too busy to attend.

For
 about £300, seven professionals will wail loudly – as expected of 
family mourners in a traditional Chinese ritual – and encourage others 
not to be embarrassed to join in.

An absence of tears indicates the 
deceased was not loved, and disgraces the family.

Chen Shuqiang, 35, leads a group of 
mourners in Feishan, in south-east China’s Fujian province, and says 
business is booming.

'By far the most popular professional mourners are young women, there is very little demand for men,' she said.

'They like us to make a lot of noise and looked visibly very upset at the passing over of a loved one.

'Throwing ourselves on the ground in front of the coffin is quite popular, as is trying to grab hold of it as it’s taken away by the pallbearers.'

As well as being hired out by family, the mourners are also being paid by other people who are too busy to attend the funeral.

Clients typically pay around £300 for the basic package, involving all seven professional mourners.

Chen said people offering professional mourning services almost exclusively hired out of work actors.

She herself used to be a singer at a rural opera troupe, but said the money was always hard to come by until she switched to become a professional crier where her voice had been a big advantage.

'Ever since then I’ve never had a problem with money, this is a really well-paid job, and I still get to do what I love,' she said.

'I get to dress up and make a song and dance in front of an audience.'
