A  Rocky montage isn't complete without an all-grey sweat suit, raw eggs to down and a spot of meat punching, but who has the Eye of the Tiger between Jamie Redknapp and Freddie Flintoff?

Former Liverpool midfielder Redknapp and Flintoff, the ex-England cricket captain, went head-to-head in this week's A League Of Their Own to see who could recreate the classic workout. 

Under the guidance of boxing great and undisputed world heavyweight champion Lennon Lewis, the pair were put to the test to see who has what it takes and who, as Rocky would say, is just a bum.

Flintoff added his own twist to the challenge by downing a bottle of later before punching the meat

To prove it, Redknapp and Flintoff had to skip, hop with a tree trunk on their shoulders, down a raw egg, catch a runaway chicken and punch meat before making the famous run up the steps.

Flintoff gave it his own twist by adding a bottle of lager to the challenge to wash down the egg. 

In the end, they were both winners and Sylvester Stallone would surely be proud of either effort.

And in the final sporting challenge, Olympic and World 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu and Jack Whitehall took part in a horse race quite unlike any other.

They were joined by legendary jockey Willie Carson who will provide expertise on the matter.
