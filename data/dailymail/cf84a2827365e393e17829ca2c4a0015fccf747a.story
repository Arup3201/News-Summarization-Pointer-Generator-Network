Jack Collison is training at QPR in a bid to earn a permanent contract with Harry Redknapp's side.

The 25-year-old was released by West Ham in the summer after nine years at the club following prolonged spells on the sidelines through injury.

The Welsh international will therefore be hoping this is the fresh start he needs to reignite his career.

Collison - who spent time on loan at both Bournemouth and Wigan last season - has been linked with a move to various Championship clubs this summer, but Redknapp has now given him the chance to stake a claim for a move to a Premier League side.

After making his way through the West Ham youth system, Collison would go on to make 121 appearances for the Irons scoring 14 goals in the process.

Elsewhere, Rangers striker Charlie Austin has quashed speculation linking him with a move away from Loftus Road by declaring he is happy at the club.

Midfielder Samba Diakite is also close to resolving his future as he looks set to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad on a season-long loan.
