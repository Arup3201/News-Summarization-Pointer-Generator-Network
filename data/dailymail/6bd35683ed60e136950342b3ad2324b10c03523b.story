It may have been integral in Britain's defence against  Nazi invasion, but as a historical icon the Beacon Hill Fort hasn't exactly captured hearts and minds of history tourists.

In fact, the Essex fort is Britain's least favourite tourist attraction with just just six visitors - an average of one person every 61 days or nine weeks - recorded there last year, leaving it last in VisitEngland's survey of 1,279 destinations.

Beacon Hill is a long way from the Tower of London, number one on VisitEngland's list for top paid destinations, despite being restored by the The Harwich Society after being decommissioned in 1956.

The Beacon Hill Fort in Harwich, Essex, is England's least popular attraction with just six visitors last year 

The Tower of London attracted 2,894,698 visitors in 2013, which is 7,931 per day

The British Museum is not surprisingly the most popular free attraction, with 6,701,036 visitors last year

The Tower pulled 2,894,698 visitors in 2013, 7,931 per day, but in Beacon Hill Fort's defence the historical monument currently surrounded by poppies to mark a century since the outbreak of World War I is only closed four days a year. The World War II post in Tendring, for which entry costs £1 compared to the Tower's £22, is open only on the first Sunday of each month.

For free educational entertainment, 6,701,036 visitors flocked to the British Museum to view its more than seven million objects from every continent including the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles. 

The National Gallery is a close second with 6,031,574 visitors last year. 

Beacon Hill Fort isn't alone in its unfortunate neglect from tourism - there are a host of potentially intriguing destinations open to the public that are largely neglected. Here are the 10 least visited attractions in England.
