Little black dresses were once the wardrobe staple of stylish women everywhere, but if you're looking to be on trend in 2014, it's time to ditch the failsafe option.

Sales of the LBD are falling in favour of more colourful prints, according to retailers.

Fashion e-tailer Matchesfashion.com sell twice as many print or coloured dresses than black ones, while Asos say 60 per cent of its dress sales come from designs that are not little and black.

'Prints are always key for Asos as they are visually appealing when looking online,' Jacqui Markham, Asos's womenswear design director told The Guardian.

And it seems that we are taking inspiration from the catwalks of London where all things bright and beautiful dominated Fashion Week.

Leading the way was Mary Katrantzou, who is synonymous with 
bright, bold prints.

The Greek designer's SS14 collection reasserted her love of all things graphic and she transferred her inspiration into a rainbow coloured collection of floral patterns often embellished with Swarovski crystals for maximum impact.

There was neon purple, fluorescent 
green, electric blue and acid yellow, and - of course - the pinkest of pinks.

The trend has also translated to Tinseltown. Whether it's Cara Delevingne gurning in a rainbow outfit or Kim Kardashian pounding the streets of LA in a canary yellow ensemble, A-listers are adopting bright hues in their droves.

Speaking about the colourful trend, fashion blogger Jessica Styles said: 'Black doesn't look particularly appealing online, I am much more likely to click on something vibrant that jumps out at me.

'Thanks to Instagram and Facebook, dowdy black dresses just don't cut it anymore.

'Followers want to see something aesthetically pleasing so it's all about the bold colour with plenty of embellishment.'
