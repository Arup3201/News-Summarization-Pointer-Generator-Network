Three tribesmen who allegedly raped a British tourist are being kept hidden from police by their indigenous community in the north of Colombia.

The 23-year-old woman, from London, was reportedly assaulted by three members of the Wayuu tribe in the village of Cabo de la Vela in the Guajira region of the country last weekend.

The tourist is thought to have had an argument with the four companions she was travelling with and got lost after setting off by herself, according to news website Terra.

The woman asked for help when she found the Wayuu village. Instead, she was sexually assaulted, she claims.

Police commander of La Guajira, Colonel Elber Velasco Garavito, said the alleged attackers had been identified.

He said: 'She filed the report and described the three tribesmen who [she says] participated in the sexual assault. She was attended by the police who accompanied her until she left back for London.'

He added that the tribe was thwarting officers' attempts to detain the trio.

Colombia's constitution guarantees the Wayuu a certain amount of autonomy. The tribe has its own sovereignty and certain cultural heritages.

Velasco added: 'They [the local community] claim they have the power to punish those responsible. We say that, in this case, that autonomy does not apply and we should advance the investigation.'

The Colombian government has been trying to rebrand the country and shake off its troubled image associated with drugs and kidnapping.

It is the fourth largest country in South America and a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal.

Colombia's diverse culture reflects the country's indigenous Indian, Spanish and African roots.
