A publican has slammed police after he was questioned on suspicion of committing a public order offence over a comment he wrote on his pub blackboard about the 1958 Munich air disaster.

Former magistrate Kevin Banks, 55, wrote 'Munich' in capitals before using the word as an acronym to spell out the message: 'Manchester United Never Intended Coming Home.'

The controversial comment was one of Mr 
Banks' regular 'thought for the week' comments he writes on the 
blackboard in the tap room to get punters talking.

But
 police were called in by customer who noticed the message alongside 
routine announcements written by Mr Banks including use of electronic 
cigarettes at his pub and prices of lager.

Today, Mr Banks accused officers of cracking down on free speech over the way they handled a complaint.

An officer went to speak to the father-of-six and gave him 'words of advice' before the landlord agreed to let him rub out the message. No further action will be taken against him.

Manchester United fan Mr Banks, who is the landlord of the Sweet Green Tavern in Bolton, Greater Manchester, defended his post about the 1958 crash in which 23 people lost their lives.

He claimed he was simply repeating a statement made by former United player Wyn Davies about the tragedy.

Mr Banks said: 'I can't believe police haven't got better things to do than speak to me about a message which I wrote to get people talking. It's another example of a crack down on free speech.

'If someone is offended by it then I'm afraid that's tough on them. People die everywhere and I don't see why this is distasteful.

'I put it up on the blackboard, there is nothing disrespectful about it. People are edging round death all the time, this is the real world, get on with it.

'I am a Manchester United supporter and went to 500 consecutive matches. I don't find it disrespectful - whoever does needs to get a reality check.

'To me it is something thought-provoking to make people stop and think. Last week, I had a message up about planet earth celebrating its 13.82 billion birthday.'

Complaint: A customer at Kevin Banks's pub, The Sweet Green Tavern, Bolton, complained to police about his 'thought for the day' message about the 1958 crash in which 23 people lost their lives

The incident occurred after Mr Banks who has been landlord at the pub for ten years raised eyebrows by writing the message and in yellow and white chalk.

He said: 'I was not saying anything derogatory about Manchester United or the air disaster. It was purely an acronym and if I thought it was offensive I never would have written it.

'Munich was an awful accident and my heart goes out to the people who died and their families and the people who were in the crash. It raised eyebrows at first and whilst the reaction rocketed no one could explained why it is offensive - maybe they are seeing something I'm not.

'I know Wyn Davies quite well and we talked about the air disaster. He said of all the airports it could have happened it was Munich, he said you don't suppose it means Manchester United Never Intended Coming Home.

'I'd never thought or heard of that before and I thought that was very clever.

I wrote on the blackboard, 'just had a conversation with Win Davies and he points out that the air disaster happened at Munich and he thinks it stands for this. Underneath I put that he was a clever man.

'I thought to myself is this offensive but I couldn't see that it was. What is offensive is opposing fans chanting 'Munich Munich Munich' at Manchester United fans.

'I was off work on the Friday and the barmaid said there was a woman in who she'd never seen before who said it was extremely offensive and it should be taken down. I explained how I'd got the remark.

'The next thing I knew was the police were at the pub and they wanted to arrest me. The policeman said he was here to see me about the offensive remarks and I asked him why it was offensive.

'I told him he was telling me it was offensive but why. I said if he could tell me why then I would take it down. He said it was a public order offence. I said that I used to be a Manchester United fan and a former player had told me it.

'I intially said I was not giving him permission to wipe it off the board but he wiped it off anyway because he said he didn't want to arrest me. I just couldn't believe the over reaction.'

'In future under my messages I'll write: 'however if you find offence with the above statements feel free to use your democratic sights to go and drink elsewhere'.

One customer, said: 'There are normally little quips on the blackboard, but this upset me.

'A lot of people died in that crash and it was horrific. I find it offensive. If someone chanted this at a football match they would probably be prosecuted and I think it was right police spoke to the landlord.

'What he wrote was disrespectful to the people who died.'

Dale O'Donnell, from the Manchester United online fanzine Stretty News, said: 'If I saw that message on a pub wall, I would walk out. It's a disgusting thing to write.

'I can understand the landlord's general point that people are too sensitive towards death, but this is not the way to go about proving a point.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We had a call about a blackboard message about the Munich Air Disaster that was deemed to be offensive.

'We sent an officer and the landlord offered to resolve the complaint by removing the message. He denied that the message was offensive but was happy to remove it.'
