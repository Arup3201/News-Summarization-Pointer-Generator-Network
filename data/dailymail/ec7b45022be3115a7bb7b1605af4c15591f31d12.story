A niche gadget designer has created the world's most expensive iPhone 5 from gold, white diamonds and a rare £9million black diamond.

Craftsman Stuart Hughes created a 24-carat gold smartphone with an Apple logo encrusted with 53 sparkling jewells.

The phone is now worth £10million.

This one of a kind solid gold, black diamond encrusted iPhone 5 is said to be the most expensive in the world

Mr Hughes, who develops 'exclusive, elite gadgets', was approached by a mysterious businessman from Hong Kong who he refers to as 'Joe'.

The unidentified millionaire travelled to Liverpool to meet the niche designer with a rare 26 carat black diamond that forms the centrepiece.

The hand-crafted iPhone 5 is encrusted with a jaw-dropping 600 white diamonds and the sapphire glass screen contains 135 grams of 24-carat gold.

But without the black diamond the phone would be worth a meagre £150,000

Mr Hughes said: 'The most difficult part of building the phone was the solid gold chassis.

A normal iPhone 5 smartphone handset which retails at around £550

'At first we found that the 3G didn't work as well due to the amount of gold we added. But we soon perfected the processes which is why "Joe" approached us.'

The 43 year-old is no stranger to crafting expensive phones.

He has created a solid gold handset for Australian football team owner and gold magnate Tony Sage.

The designer laughed: 'Luckily with Mr Sage we had absolutely no problem getting hold of gold as he's involved in the gold extraction business.'

The black diamond iPhone 5 has beaten the previous record set by Mr Hughes in 2009 with a £1.92million iPhone 3GS Supreme.
