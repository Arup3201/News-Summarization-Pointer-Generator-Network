Prosecutors will seek an indictment against a North Carolina police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed man 10 times after he survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help.

The officer, Randall Kerrick, 27, is charged with voluntary manslaughter in the September shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old former Florida A&M University football player.

Jonathan’s family claim that Ferrell was in a submissive position – either on his knees or lying on the ground – when he was shot, according to NBC News. The autopsy report revealed that the bullets were on a downward trajectory when they struck.

The lawsuit also alleges that despite Ferrell
 lying mortally wounded on the ground officers still deemed it necessary
 to handcuff him, according to NBC News.

As well as compensation, the family is hoping the suit forces the police to make Officer Kerrick’s dash-cam video public for the first time.

The deadly encounter unfolded in Charlotte at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday September 14 after Mr Ferrell had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape.

Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention.

Thinking it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lived there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called police.

The authorities subsequently released a tape of her 911 call.

A sobbing woman can be heard pleading for police to ‘please hurry’ after telling a dispatcher that a man was breaking into her front door.

‘He’s still there yelling,’ the woman said as the 911 dispatcher told her officers were on their way. ‘He’s yelling. He’s yelling.’

The unidentified woman keeps repeating ‘Oh, my god! Oh, my god!’ throughout the call.

She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. ‘He’s in his bed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said.

Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’

When three officers arrived they claim that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn.

Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times.

CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired.

Kerrick appeared in court in September after being charged with voluntary manslaughter. He is the first officer charged in a fatal shooting in more than 30 years.

‘We’re confident at the resolution of this case it will be found that Officer Kerrick’s actions were justified on the night in question,’ his attorney Michael Greene said in a brief statement outside the courtroom, reports The Charlotte Observer.

Ferrell's family said the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer.

Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help.

'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said.

His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters.

'He was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his heart. And he was always concerned about his family.'

'He had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said.

He said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble before.

Kerrick is on paid leave while the Charlotte police department conducts an investigation. He will appear before a grand jury on January 21.
