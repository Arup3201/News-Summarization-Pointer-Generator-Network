These amazing images were captured by a professional photographer who flew along the Adriatic coastline in Italy over the summer. 

As thousands of sun worshipers lazed on the golden sands, sheltering underneath massive beach umbrellas, German photographer Bernhard Lang took these stunning photographs. 

The colourful umbrellas create amazing geometric patterns which contrast dramatically with the golden sand and azure-coloured sea. 

From his aerial vantage point the people on the beach and swimming in the sea are mere specks compared to the bright coloured umbrellas. 

Mr Lang told My Modern Met: 'The message might be to show the impact of human beings on the natural environment. 

'On the other side, the birds-eye view reveals that we are just small creatures, not as important as we think we are.'

German photographer Bernhard Lang flew along the length of the Adriatic coast in Italy with his camera to capture images of people at the beach

The unusual beach photographs have turned the people enjoying themselves into little specks with the beach umbrellas creating the most amazing patterns 

Mr Lang took different style photographs, with long shots showing long sections of beach with others zoomed in to concentrate on the complex visual patterns

In some of the photographs, such as the one on the left, the people are completely unaware they are being photographed, but there are people looking up on the right

From the air it is possible to see how almost every inch of sand is used on a busy summer's day on the Adriatic coastline

This beach appears to offer slightly more privacy with some clear space between the rows of sun loungers all of which are placed in impressively straight lines 

In this photograph the footsteps of the holiday makers have made interesting patterns in the sand as people move from the shaded area towards the bar 

Bernhard Lang said his work questions the impact that humans have on the earth, but also shows how small and insignificant they actually are

The aerial photographs show that along large sections of the Italian Adriatic coast, not one inch of sand is wasted as sun loungers are placed up to the tide mark

From 1,000 feet in the air, the beach volley game looks slightly strange as the net appears as a small green line 

Here the beige colour of the umbrellas makes them virtually anonymous with in this instance the main focus are the people surrounding the small red boat 

In comparison to the previous photograph, the umbrellas in this image create a confusing optical illusion  making it difficult to focus for any length of time 

These central sun loungers seem to be surrounded by bamboo fences to protect the sun worshipers' privacy - but not from Mr Lang's eye in the sky 

From his aerial platform, Bernhard Lang was able to photograph this amazing sand castle art which was hidden behind a tall fence 

From the air, Bernhard Lang had almost unlimited visibility on this warm summer day where thousands of Italians decide to decamp for a bit

Here the opposing colours look almost like some form of ancient board game while the sand appears to have a leather-like consistency 

The angle of this photograph is so acute it is difficult to decide whether the image is the correct way up, adding to its interest

In this first photograph, the sun bathers seem less interested in having their own umbrella compared to the people in the right hand photograph

Along this section of beach many of people have turned their loungers away from the water and as the shadows show, towards the sun for that all important even tan

From the air, the colours and patterns on the ground can create a dizzying effect in the colourful images
