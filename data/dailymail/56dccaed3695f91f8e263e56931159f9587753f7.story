Councils are to get new powers to stop betting shops blighting high streets.

Measures being drawn up by ministers will mean local authorities effectively being able to cap the number of bookmakers opening up, according to well-placed sources.

The reforms are expected to be unveiled before Easter following mounting pressure on the Government to curb the explosion of shops containing high stakes gambling machines.

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales, has called for sweeping changes to the licensing system to limit the growth of betting premises.

Ralph Topping, chief executive of William Hill, has also backed calls for councils to be handed greater powers to block new betting shops where there are existing clusters.

Changes to planning rules last year made it easier for bookmakers to convert empty shops on the high street without needing permission.

Over the last decade, the number of betting shops in some areas has doubled. Campaigners against fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling, accused firms of opening more shops to get round limits on the number of machines in each.

Critics of the machines, which allow people to wager up to £100 a spin every 20 seconds, say they are highly addictive and have made casino-style gambling accessible on the high street.

Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs, also dubbed the 
‘crack cocaine’ of gambling, have been under increasing scrutiny in 
recent months. The terminals are increasingly key to the bookmaking 
industry, now raking in more than £1bn a year in profit.

In January, David Cameron 
admitted that there is a ‘problem’ that needs to be addressed and 
offered to work with Labour to tackle the rising number of betting shops
 and fixed-odds betting machines.

Labour has suggested putting 
betting shops in a separate use class so that councils can use planning 
powers to control the number opening in their area.

Another proposal being considered
 is to allow councils to consider the ‘cumulative’ impact when making 
licensing decisions which would force betting companies to prove that 
new shops would not have a negative effect on the local economy or 
existing businesses.Tony Page, the LGA’s licensing 
spokesman, said: ‘Councils aren’t anti-bookies but need powers to tackle
 the damage that can be caused to high streets and town centres by the 
clustering of betting shops.

‘Planning and licensing controls are supposed to ensure new shops or business will benefit an area but the current system is preventing councils from acting on community concerns. The result is many of our high streets becoming saturated with betting shops and councils left powerless to act to limit the number opening up in their area.

‘Licensing laws must be updated to allow councils to consider the impact a new betting shop would have on their local economy and existing businesses. This would protect the power of local communities and democratically-elected councillors to shape their area.’

A Government source said: ‘We have said that we will look again at the issue of betting shops and fixed odds betting terminals. For now, we would urge local authorities to use the range of powers and tools they already have under gambling and planning legislation where particular problems arise.’
