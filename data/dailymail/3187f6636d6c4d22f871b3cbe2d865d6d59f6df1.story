Australian Captain Michael Clarke says his courageous effort to overcome injury is inspired by the late Phillip Hughes, whose memory is the reason he ‘gets out of bed every day’.

Clarke is currently undergoing gruelling daily rehab, desperately working to return to the field after surgery on his torn hamstring in December.

The determined 33-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that he remains motivated by his promise to honour his ‘little brother’ Hughes.

‘Phillip Hughes is what gets me out of bed every day. He is the reason I get up at 5am to train and recover,’ Michael Clarke told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I will play as much for him as I will for me. That is my driving force.’

Phillip Hughes was killed during a Sheffield Shield match in November when he suffered a blow to the head by a cricket ball, resulting in a catastrophic brain injury.

Clarke is mindful of making the most of opportunities after Hughes’ untimely death.

‘My rehab is fulltime, eight hours a day, but it will be worth it when I’m back on the park,’ said Clarke.

‘I do it because of the fact is, I can still play. I am lucky,’ he said.

Clarke’s memories of Hughes are never far from his mind and play an important part in his decision-making today.

‘I spoke to Phil a lot and when we’d talk about how long I’d play for, he’d always say that he wanted me to keep playing,’ Clarke told Daily Mail Australia.

‘He keeps me going.’

‘My relationship with Phil wasn’t about cricket. It was a lot more than that. I mean, of course he respected me as a captain and everything, but he was my little brother,' Clarke said of Hughes (pictured)

‘I will play as much for Phillip as I will for me. That is my driving force,' Clarke said of his relentless approach to his rehabilitation, motivated by his goal of playing cricket again

Clarke was a pillar of strength for Hughes’ family, his teammates and the entire Australian community in the wake of the devastating accident at the Sydney Cricket Ground which claimed Hughes’ life.

Every day the Australian captain was at Hughes’ bedside at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney, as the nation prayed that the young batsman with a cheeky smile and so much promise would recover.

After Hughes’ heartbreaking death, Clarke travelled to the batsman’s hometown of Macksville in northern NSW.

He delivered a moving eulogy and was an unwavering support to Hughes’ loved ones.

‘Phillip would have done the same for me,’ Clarke said of the support he has given to the Hughes family.

In January, Phillip Hughes’ father Greg, mother Virginia and siblings Megan and Jason showed enormous strength by returning to the the SCG, the ground where Hughes was felled.

They watched the Test between Australia and India with Clarke was by their side.

‘My relationship with Phil wasn’t about cricket. It was a lot more than that. I mean, of course he respected me as a captain and everything, but he was my little brother.

‘Phillip and I were really close, his family and I are really close and I will always do whatever I can for them.’

However, all-too-aware of the inexplicable loss they feel, Clarke adds ‘I only wish I could do more.’

Clarke has the utmost faith that he will overcome his injury and play again for ‘Hughesy’.

He spoke with Daily Mail Australia as part of the Oral B ‘Gnashes’ promotion, which is recruiting to get Aussies on board with a dental hygiene campaign. 

‘I am only 33 years old, I have a lot more to give,’ said Clarke.

‘I have a lot to offer. I’m fit and healthy so I will keep getting out of bed at 5am and trying to get back to my best.’

The World Cup this month and the Ashes in July are looming, yet Clarke insists he is focussed on returning to the game whenever he is ready.

‘I haven’t set a time frame for myself at all, all of us would love to go out and win the World Cup and I would love to be in England for the Ashes.’

‘But I’m not going to prioritise certain events. I’m only 33 years old, I know I have a lot more to give,

There have been media reports criticising Clarke and his role as captain.

Clarke admits that he is aware of the reports and does keep track of the commentary in the media.

‘I read everything out there about me pretty much but I do try not to take it on,’ Clarke conceded with a laugh.

‘I think sport in Australia is so important. We should be proud of our athletes.’

‘I myself have respect for so many athletes out there and how they represent the country and they should never be taken for granted.’

The 33-year-old manages to stay positive due to his great passion for the game and his awareness that it is just that – a game.

‘It’s just a game, the friendships are bigger than cricket,’ said Clarke.

‘I’ve always loved cricket since I was just seven years old. But I’m aware that it’s not my job, it’s my hobby.’

‘Whatever happens, I will play as long as I can, whether I’m lucky enough to play for my country or my state or in club cricket.’

With no Ashes series this Australian summer, Clarke is encouraging Aussies to brush up on their oral health by taking part in the two week True Blue Challenge, or as he is calling it: 'The Gnashes'

Clarke opened up about another moment in his career which served as a stark reminder to value the people in the game, rather than obsess over the competition.

‘I have learnt a lot about myself and about the game in the last eight weeks,’ he said.

‘But I remember in 2007 when I was playing in the World Cup in the West Indies and my mum called me to tell me that my dad had been diagnosed with cancer.’

‘My attitude towards cricket actually changed back then, straight away.’

‘What we’ve been going through during the last eight weeks (since Hughes died) has been similar.

Clarke says he maintains a positive attitude by focussing on how fortunate he is and by cherishing the friendships he makes along the way.

‘I am passionate about playing the game together with other people and meeting people.

‘I value my family and friends and I know that cricket is just a game.’ 

He is looking forward to having cricket in his life in the future and hopes that involves plenty more Test matches for Australia. 

‘I love the game. I’ve been lucky in my career to not have had many injuries – one of the lucky few!’

‘This was my first surgery and I am thankful that my body has held up as long as it has.’

Rather than feel frustrated by his struggle with his injuries, Clarke says he is grateful for the lengthy and illustrious career he has already enjoyed. 

‘I am thankful; the game has given me so much. I owe the game, it doesn’t owe me.’

‘What will be will be and until then I will concentrate on doing everything I possibly can.’
