Michael Essien has backed  teammate Fernando Torres to score 'lots of goals' at AC Milan after the former Chelsea pair were reunited at the San Siro.

The Spain international's time at Stamford Bridge will always be classed an expensive mistake after he failed to live up to his prolific reputation following a £50million move from Liverpool in 2011.

However, Essien claims that the 30-year-old has been working hard in training and will rejuvenate his stalled career with the Serie A side.

Spain international's time at Stamford Bridge will not be remembered as a success

'I really hope he does well for Milan and for himself because he's a top striker and we'll benefit from his goals. 

'He's a hard worker both in games and in training and that can also serve him well at Milan,' Essien told fifa.com.  

'One thing Milan can expect to see is 100 per cent all the time from him. I am convinced we'll see lots of goals from Fernando,' he added.

Essien's final seasons with the Blues were equally lacklustre after the Ghana international struggled to recover from a series of career threatening injuries before signing for the Rossoneri on a one-and-a-half year contract in January.

Jose Mourinho has created a team in his own image that can be a force in Europe for next decade

The midfielder, known as 'The Bison', bears no ill feeling towards his former club and believes influential manager Jose Mourinho has constructed a team that can be a force in Europe for the forseeable future.

Asked how he thinks Chelsea will perform this season, Essien said: 'I think they'll do well as always. Jose has rebuilt the team in his own image now and they'll fight for everything this season. 

'They have to ability to win things and that’s what they'll be doing. Chelsea have become a football force in Europe in the last ten years and I can see that carrying on for the next ten years or more.'
