ISIS cell members who used animals to practice how to behead people are the first to be discovered operating in Israel.

The seven men were caught just before executing an attack, Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency said.

All seven admitted to belonging to ISIS and that they were part of a plot to attack Druze Israelis - a branch of Shia Islam - as well as police officers and the security service.

The defendants, who are thought to be the first ISIS members to be discovered operating in Israel, were arrested in Haifa and charged with joining and aiding the terrorist group as well as attempting to contact terrorists abroad.

It is believed that the men, all from the northern city of Sakhnin, were trying to set up a branch of the terrorist network in Israel. 

The Jerusalem Post named the men as Adnan Aladin, 40, a lawyer in Nazareth, Hasam Marisat, 30, Karim Abu-Tzalah, 22, Alaa Abu-Tzalah, 27, Halad Abu Tzahalh, 30, Sarif Khaled Abu-Tzalah, 29, and Muhammad Abu Tazalah, 27.

Israeli security services said that the men were planning to flee to Syria to fight for ISIS after carrying out their attack in Israel.

The extremist group currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria, where it has beheaded scores of captives.

Victims include western journalists and aid workers such as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning and Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

Thousands of Muslims from Western countries are believed to have flocked to Syria to join ISIS, including an estimated 30 Israelis.

Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to increase trade with the Far East following a 'wave of Islamisation' in western Europe.

The Israeli Prime Minister said rising hostility in Europe had forced his hand into expanding trade with countries like Japan, China and India.

'We definitely want to reduce our dependence on certain markets in western Europe,' Mr Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting yesterday.

'Western Europe is undergoing a wave of Islamisation, of anti-Semitism, and of anti-Zionism. It is awash in such waves, and we want to ensure that for years to come the state of Israel will have diverse markets all over the world.'

His remarks came as Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, arrived in Israel with a trade delegation.

According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, Europe accounted for 45.8 percent of imports and 35.8 percent of exports in the first 11 months of 2014. Asia accounted for 22.5 percent of Israeli imports and 25.4 percent of exports.

Viewers of Israel's parliamentary TV channel were asked: 'Can Israel do without exports to Europe and pursue policy that is liable to bring about an economic embargo?'

62 two percent of Israelis said no and 32 percent said yes.
