A four-toothed cat left decrepit by illness and facing being put-down was saved to live out the remainder of his days by a family of animal lovers. 

Zeb was days away from death after contracting feline immunodeficiency virus which cost him most of his teeth and one eye. 

The cat, which now has more than 3,000 fans on Facebook, was about to be put down by vets at the Cumberland County SPCA in New Jersey when he was taken in by City of Elderly Love, a senior pet rescue organization based in Philadelphia.

Zeb was about to be euthanized by vets at the SPCA in New Jersey when he was taken in by City of Elderly Love, an organisation which cares for senior pets

After starring in one of the organisation's video, he was taken in by the Flor family in Spring City, Pennsylvania, and is settling into life in a loving home

And after appearing in one of its videos, the animal, aged around 12, was picked up by Beth Flor from Spring City, Pennsylvania, to add to her family of four. 

'He's really affectionate. He's just happy to have blankets to lie on and peoplea to give him some affection,' Mrs Flor told ABC news. 

The family already had a cat and three dogs when Zeb was brought home before Christmas. 

'My kids absolutely adore him. It's hard to get photos of him because I get on the floor to get a photo and he immediately runs over.'

Mrs Flor, who previously volunteered at a shelter for elderly pets, said she hoped more people will adopt senior animals which also need homes.  

'Just because an animal may not look like the obvious choice for adoption doesn't mean he or she won’t be perfect for your family. 

'People like an underdog, I think.' 

Alongside Mrs Flor's two daughters, the cat now must get used to another feline and three dogs
