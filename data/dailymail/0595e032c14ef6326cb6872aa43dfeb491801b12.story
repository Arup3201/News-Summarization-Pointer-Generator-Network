On the Bravo series Southern Charm, Jenna King claims to be a well-to-do South Carolina girl who just can’t stay away from the place she and the rest of the cast consider home - Charleston.

But in truth Jenna comes from humble beginnings and her affection for the Palmetto state doesn’t seem to run as deep as it appeared on screen.

Not so southern: Jenna King grew up in South Carolina all right, but not exactly in the town she says she came from. And she didn't exactly hang around the Palmetto state after shooting the reality show

House of cards: When Jenna was asked on the show  how she could afford the pricey four-bedroom digs in Charlestown, she answered, 'With my bank account.' But the truth is Jenna never owned or even lived in it.

While Jenna gushed in one interview that she did Southern Charm because she wanted to spend time with ‘the two most important things’ in her life — friends and family — one neighbor who lives just down the dirt road from her mom Jane and step-dad Mike’s double-wide trailer throws that sentiment into doubt.

'It’s been a long time since Jenna’s come around,’ reveals the neighbor. 

Jenna’s presence in Charleston is just as rare — unless the cameras are rolling. Though she insisted on the show that ‘there is no place like home,’ the 29-year-old hasn’t been spotted in the charming little city since at least last spring when she ‘lived’ in an extravagant four-bedroom, four-story historic home on Ashley Avenue.

In one memorable scene on the show, 
Brandy, a friend of Jenna’s cast mate, Whitney Sudler-Smith, asks where 
she got the money for such a nice place.

Southern charmer: Jenna  liked to flaunt her beauty even as a kid. On the show she made it seem that she had plenty of dough. Play dough maybe?

‘With my bank account,’ Jenna snipes.

Maybe not. The answer to the mystery of how she could afford such lavish living may lie in Bravo network’s expense account  - and what amounted to a pricey hotel for the reality show shoot.

‘The house was temporarily rented last 
year just for the Bravo shoot,’ a local real estate professional reveals
 to MailOnline. ‘They used it for some interior and exterior shots and 
Jenna had absolutely nothing else to do with the property. She never 
lived there or owned it.’

'I’ve never
 seen anyone go in or out of the house, we’ve always thought that no one
 lived there,’ 20-year-old College of Charleston student Nicole DeMarco,
 who has lived next door to the historic property since last summer, 
tells MailOnline. ‘It’s completely dark.’

The
 entire building is up for sale. The real owners of the property, 
currently listed for $1.785 million, are a local couple who live full 
time on the beach and want to offload it.

Blondie: Is it true blondes have more fun? Jenna did. As a teen, Jenna was a popular cheerleader in high school and loved listening to Peaches & Cream by 112

In fact, 
Jenna’s last real residence in Charleston was a simple one-floor, 
three-bedroom rental on Saint Margaret Street that she shared in 2007 
with other students while attending Trident Technical College. After she 
moved out of state, the property was sold for $295,000 and re-rented for
 $1900 a month, or less than $650 per bedroom.

These
 days Jenna’s life is almost solely concentrated far away from South 
Carolina in Los Angeles, where she lives the good life.

Sugar daddy: At first Jenna denied that Lou was her meal ticket. But the wealthy real estate mogul lavished her with Louboutins and designer togs

Much
 of Jenna's around-the-world escapades were thanks to Lou, her 
55-year-old real estate magnate boyfriend at the time she shot show. 
Although she vehemently denied  being a golddigger, saying she 'would have married 
Lou seven years ago. It’s not about money for me at all, ’ Lou 
reportedly footed the bill, including for her pricey clothes.

On Bravo's April 28 reunion special, 
Jenna confessed that her closet full of Christian Louboutin shoes, which
 often run over $1000 a pair, was thanks to Lou and his wallet — and 
that the cost was nothing to him.

And
 when host Andy Cohen pressed her on exactly what she did for money, Jenna quipped, 'I'm really good at rolling the dice playing Craps.'

School days: 'I love a good bowl cut," says Jenna, photographed on her first day of school.

Any real wealth she has  is more likely tied to  real estate investments with Lou, who is rumored to deal in large property developments around the world.

But Jenna recently confessed that she broke up with Lou and she's taken to traveling around with Ronnie Radke, lead vocalist of Falling in Reverse.

In her 
Bravo bio, Jenna claims she grew up in Sumter, South Carolina, a small 
city with a population of 40,000. In reality, she hails from Wedgefield,
 a village ten miles away that has just over 3,000 residents. 

And that little white lie doesn’t sit right with one local.

‘I told people if I were ever to get 
famous I wouldn’t claim Sumter, I’d claim Wedgefield,’ local Daniel 
Goodman, 26, tells MailOnline of the town that consists of a gas 
station, post office and two tiny general stores. ‘You shouldn’t be 
ashamed of where you’re from no matter what.’

Despite her less than affluent upbringing, Jenna had a happy childhood. Jenna grew up in a modest doublewide trailer set on several acres of land. One neighbor tells MailOnline that the Kings are known as 'a nice family' around town.

The well-kept mobile home has an open outdoor garage. Jane and Mike King own a practical car that is a far cry from the Mercedes Benz their daughter supposedly owned and drove around on Southern Charm.

Dogs roam free on the property and loudly greet guests while several others live in a fenced-in kennel. A friend of the family tells MailOnline that Jenna’s mom Jane is a kind-hearted person who rescues stray animals. The King’s are so protective of their pets that they put out a sign warning drivers, ‘Old dog, young dog, several stupid dogs, please drive slowly.’

Student housing: Jenna lived in this one-story Saint Margaret Street rental in North Charleston while attending Trident Technical College. The modest three- bedroom home was far from the upscale historic townhouse used in the show

The Southern Charm star was a well-liked cheerleader at Lakewood High School, which had an average graduating class of 30 students. Jenna faced a 25-minute drive down quiet country roads to get here from her childhood home.

‘My cousin had a crush on her in high school and said she was real pretty and not shy at all,’ Wedgefield local Daniel Goodman tells MailOnline.

Splish splash: Jenna was all wet when she said she paid for the Charleston house with her bank account

These days Jenna’s life is almost solely concentrated far away from South Carolina in Los Angeles. And since she recently confessed that she broke up with Lou, her 55-year-old New Yorker boyfriend many suggest was also her sugar daddy, Jenna’s taken to traveling around with Ronnie Radke, her new man and lead vocalist of Falling in Reverse.

It now remains to be seen if Bravo will pick up Southern Charm for a second season — or if Jenna will return to spend more time in the Southern state she insists she loves.

‘We kind of figure people will always come back,’ Goodman says, adding that in Jenna’s case he isn’t so sure. 

‘She’s scared of what she came from.’
