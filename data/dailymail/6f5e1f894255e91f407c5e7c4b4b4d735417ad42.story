Rick Santorum's eldest daughter took his place at a rally yesterday as the Republican presidential candidate took time off the campaign trail to tend to her sick three-year-old sister.

Elizabeth Santorum, 20, took the stage to address supporters in a hangar at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport in Florida.

Mr Santorum cancelled campaign events yesterday morning after his disabled daughter Bella was admitted to hospital for pneumonia.

He will return to the campaign trail later today.

'Rick and his wife Karen are admitting their daughter Bella to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia this evening,' campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement late on Saturday night.

Mr Santorum spoke with Florida supporters by telephone yesterday from Bella's hospital room and said doctors hope she can go home in the next few days.

The former Pennsylvania senator said: 'We're going to get out on the campaign trail later tomorrow... heading out to the Midwest, and start campaigning in the next states as we move this campaign forward.'

Mr Santorum has a speech scheduled for later today in Missouri and another event in south-west Minnesota - two states with early February contests.

He then plans to head to Colorado and Nevada for events tomorrow.

'I feel very, very good about where we are and where the campaign is going,' the candidate said.

Disability: The three-year-old was born with Trisomy 18, a genetic disorder fatal to half of those born with it within their first week

By Sunday evening an aid told ABC News that the three-year-old has pneumonia in both of her lungs.

Mr Santorum had been scheduled to 
appear
on NBC's Meet The Press and attend church in Miami.

Officials did not 
cancel Sunday afternoon's events in Sarasota and Punta Gorda, where 
Elizabeth Santorum made an appearance in her 
father's place.

She told reporters on Sunday: 'You know we do what we do as a family, you know we stick together and you know, we get through and we're hanging in there.'

Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development.

Described as a relatively common condition, it occurs in about one out of 3,000 live births, killing half of those within their first week.

Those who have survived into their teenage years suffer from serious medical and developmental problems including clenched hands, mental deficiency, a small head or jaw and heart defects.

A small number of adults with the condition make it to their twenties or thirties while always requiring assisted caregiving.

Isabella Santorum has Trisomy 18, a genetic condition caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 18th chromosome.

Mr Santorum said of his daughter: 'She without a doubt has turned the corner.'

But he cautioned she 'isn't out of the woods yet'.

When asked about her, Mr Santorum 
says his daughter was not expected to survive until her first birthday 
and often has to catch himself to stop from tears.

'I
have a little girl who's three-and-a-half years old,' he told Christian
conservatives in Iowa before winning the caucus contest there.

'I don't 
know whether her life is going to be measured - it's always been 
measured - in days and weeks. Yet here I am... because I feel like I 
wouldn't be a good dad if I wasn't out here fighting for a country that 
would see the dignity in her and every other child.'

When voters ask him about her, he 
calls the decision to campaign 'gut-retching' but says he hopes to fight
for all special needs families.

'You think she's fine, and then one cold and she's this close to dying,' he told the Washington Post in an interview last year.

In
October, he missed one of Bella's surgeries to participate in a debate 
and told the audience that he planned to take an all-night flight home 
from Las Vegas to be with her.

'I look at the simplicity and love 
she emits,' Mr Santorum said in a web video his campaign released after 
his scheduling drew questions, 'and it's clear to me we're the disabled 
ones.'

Mr Santorum has 
largely kept his daughter off the campaign schedules, preferring her to 
stay home with her mother.

Stepping in: Elizabeth campaigned for her father in a hanger at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport

Battle: Mr Santorum, seen holding his daughter before announcing his entry into the Republican presidential race in June, has said that her health is always quite frail and unexpected

But Bella did join Mr Santorum for a few days
around Iowa's straw poll in August, and she joined her family in 
Charleston, South Carolina on the day of its primary.

Florida's presidential primary is on Tuesday.

'You know we do what we do as a family, you know we stick together and you know, we get through and we're hanging in there.'

Santorum said that the situation as a 
'very, very tough night last night' but said by late Sunday Bella was 
'alert and back to her own beautiful, happy girl.'

Santorum said: 'It's been a very hectic 36 hours. Life in the Santorum family has dramatically improved 
since the late afternoon.'

Mr Santorum's rivals for the top White House seat, however, have taken a break from politics to send their well-wishes to his young daughter and the Santorum family.

Republican presidential primary 
frontrunner Mitt Romney told Fox News: '[My wife] Ann and I send prayers and best 
wishes for Bella's good health to Rick and Karen Santorum and their 
entire family.'

Asked whether he had a conversation with the Senator about dropping out of the race, Newt Gingrich told reporters today: 'As you, I think, may know, his 
daughter went into the hospital last night so this would be a totally 
inappropriate time to do anything like that.

'Rick's going to get a 
decent vote tomorrow - on Tuesday - I have no doubt the two of us are 
going to collectively outscore Romney. And at that point it might be a 
pretty good conversation.'

Campaign trail: Mr Santorum's political commitments sometimes clash with his family life

President Obama's adviser David Axelrod at the start of an interview on 'Meet the Press,' also offered his thoughts to the Santorum's.

'Let me also add my prayers and thoughts 
for Senator Santorum and his child. I have gone through problems with a 
child and my heart goes out to him and his family,' he said.

'I look at the simplicity and love 
she emits, and it's clear to me we're the disabled 
ones.'

- Rick Santorum

Mr Axelrod's daughter sustained brain damage 
from a series of massive epileptic seizures as an infant.

Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and former presidential candidate Rick Perry also offered their well-wishes.

Ms Palin, writing on Facebook on behalf of her family, said: 'Thank you, Rick and Karen Santorum, for living the Christ-like example of sacrifice and right priorities.

'Nothing is more precious or important than the life of an innocent child. Our prayers are with Bella, a perfect child in an imperfect world. God bless the beautiful Santorum family.'
