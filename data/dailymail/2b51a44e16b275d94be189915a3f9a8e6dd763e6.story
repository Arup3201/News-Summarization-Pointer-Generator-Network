Bestseller: One of the two Margaret Thatcher miniature Toby Jugs on sale in Parliament's shops

Margaret Thatcher regularly tops polls of Britain’s greatest Prime Ministers.

But it can be revealed that the three-times election winner is also leading the field in a unique popularity contest – to be Parliament’s best-selling Toby Jug.

The Iron Lady’s china miniature is head and shoulders above the competition, well ahead of other PMs including Winston Churchill, David Cameron and Tony Blair.

The caricatures of every prime minister since Neville Chamberlain are on sale to MPs, peers and visitors for an eye-watering £30.50.

The figures are understood to be popular among politicians wanting an unusual tribute to their political hero, or heroine.

Each jug stands at around four inches tall, and has a hole in the 'head' should the owner wish to use it for a small drink.

According to figures obtained by MailOnline, in the last three some 90 Margaret Thatcher mugs have been sold, ahead of Winston Churchill’s 81.

Lady Thatcher has consistently been the bestseller, even before her death in April.

In the last year she told 40 mugs, compared to 50 the year before.

She has proved so popular the House of Commons now stocks two different models, the only Prime Minister given such an honour.

Lady Thatcher now accounts for one in four of all sales of the miniatures in the two souvenir shops on the parliamentary estate.

The bizarre barometer of parliamentary popularity reveals the two great Prime Ministers leave the rest of the field trailing.

Some 71 people have bought David Cameron’s likeness since August 2010, according to figures obtained under freedom of information laws.

Line-up: How the Toby Jugs appear in the Commons shop. Back row (l-r): Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher. Middle Row: Winston Churchill, Alec Douglas-Home, Margaret Thatcher, John Major. Front row: Clement Attlee, Harold MacMillan, Anthony Eden, James Callaghan, Neville Chamberlain

Popularity contest: How the sales stack up from August 2010 to August 2013, according to the House of Commons

Long-serving premiers or those who won several elections seem to fare better at the tills.

In the battle for New Labour supremacy a slightly maniacal-looking Tony Blair 
trumps Gordon Brown by 31 to just 19.

Even John Major, who secured a surprise election victory in 1992 before leading the Tories to their worst election result in modern times, is proving more 
popular than Mr Brown with sales of 30 in the last three years.

Likeness: In the last three years the David Cameron jug has been bought by 71 people, well ahead of Tony Blair's 31 sales

Unsurprisingly the lower profile PMs 
from Britain’s past sell appear to sell less well, with only four people
choosing to display a model of Anthony Eden on their mantelpiece.

However, the most-lowly figure is Alex Douglas-Home, Prime Minister from 1963-4.

In the last three years not a single Toby Jug of him has been sold, the House of Commons said.

An opinion poll carried out after Lady Thatcher's death in April saw her named as Britain's most popular PM since World War Two.

In all 28 per cent named her 'the greatest' in the YouGov/Sun survey, beating Churchill into second on 24 per cent.

Tony Blair was third on 10 per cent, but David Cameron scored zero.
