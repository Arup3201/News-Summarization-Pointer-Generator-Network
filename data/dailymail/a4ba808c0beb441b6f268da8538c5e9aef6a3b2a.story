Rastafarian inmates are being handed Bob Marley CDs, drums and shakers after their religion was officially recognised by prison chiefs.

New rules mean Rastafarianism is an approved religion alongside Christianity, Islam and other major faiths.

The pack has been created to ensure Rastafarian prisoners can pray together in a ‘fulsome and harmonious way’, a faith advisor said. However, the religion’s followers have been told that one common element of their religious practice is barred: they cannot smoke cannabis in jail.

The Rastafarian faith was brought wider attention by the music of Bob Marley, left. Adherents of the religion see Haile Selassie, right, who was Emperor of Ethiopia between 1930 and 1974, as a divine being and worship him

The change in policy came after an unnamed inmate appealed to Nigel Newcomen, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.

He ruled that the Prison Service was in breach of the Equality Act 2010, and said Rastafarianism, whose followers worship Haile Selassie, the former King of Ethiopia, as God and smoke cannabis as a ‘sacrament’,  should be recognised.

Rastafarians are permitted four days ‘holiday’ off work in prison each year to celebrate festivals, and are given access to a ‘Rastafari Heritage Resource Pack’.

The new rules were put in place in November 2013 and make Rastafarianism one of the 18 religions officially recognised within the prison service

It includes a list of ‘allowed items’ provided by the National Rastafari Chaplaincy for weekly ‘Groundation’ (Holy Day) ceremonies. Among them are a CD or DVD of Rastafari drumming, music and chanting, including reggae tracks by Bob Marley, and percussion instruments.

In addition prisoners are given a small Rastafarian flag, a picture of Haile Selassie, a selection of his speeches and a copy of the King James Bible. However,  cannabis remains banned.

A spokesman for The Rastafari Faith Advisors to the Prison Chaplaincy Service said: ‘This pack provides information, texts from His Majesty’s speeches... some of the best-loved reggae tracks, as well as information that sets Rastafari in the  context of black history.

‘Every detail in the pack has been double-checked to ensure that no further blocks or barriers are placed to prevent Rastafarians from meeting and giving Ises [praise] together in a fulsome and harmonious way.’

The National Offender Management Service, which runs prisons in England and Wales, recognises 18 religions. They include Paganism and Zoroastrianism, an ancient Iranian religion.

At the time of the 2011 census, there were 7,906 Rastafarians in England and Wales - up from 5,000 in 2001 - making it the 14th largest recognised religion recorded by the survey.

Rastafarianism is a religion that developed in Jamaica after the coronation of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930.

Followers of the religion believe Emperor Selassie is God and will lead back to Africa members of the black community who were taken away by slavery and colonialism.

Emperor Salassie never saw himself as God and was not himself as Rastafarian. The belief in him as a divine being stemmed from a prophecy from Jamaican-born philosopher Marcus Garvey. He said, shortly before Selassie's coronation: 'Look to Africa where a black king shall be crowned. He shall be the Redeemer.'

Rastafarians trace Selassie's lineage back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheeba. The Book of Kings describes a visit to Solomon by the Queen and adherents of Rastafarianism believe that a child was conceived on this visit and that this child is a direct ancestor of Haile Selassie, making the Ethiopian Emperor a relation to King David and therefore Jesus.

For the coronation itself, King George V was unable to attend so instead sent the Duke of Gloucester as his emissary. At the time, due to the size of the British Empire, King George was seen as the most powerful man in the world. So, when the Duke bowed to Selassie, Rastafarians took the act of deference as an indication that the new Emperor was more important than the King of England - who the Duke was representing - and therefore the most powerful man on the planet.

There are more than one million Rastafarians worldwide. They see Ethiopia as their spiritual homeland and believe they are destined to return - led by Haile Selassie.

Although Haile Salassie was reported to have died in 1975, some Rastafarians refused to believe this and there is still some debate within the religion as to whether he is, in fact, dead.

Adherents of the faith are forbidden to cut their hair, which is why they grow dreadlocks, refrain from eating meat (especially pork), are opposed to contraception and abortion, do not drink, believe in reincarnation and smoke marijuana to increase their spiritual awareness.
