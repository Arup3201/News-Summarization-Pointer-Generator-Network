Up to 20 retired British soldiers could face arrest and prosecution as part of a police inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.

The prospect of murder or manslaughter charges was last night condemned by former senior military figures as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘politically motivated’.

The men, mostly in their sixties and seventies, face questioning under caution about the events that took place in Londonderry on January 30, 1972, when 14 civil rights marchers were killed.

Lawyers that have been hired by the Ministry of Defence will represent the ex-soldiers.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) last year launched what it expects to be a ‘lengthy and complex’ criminal investigation.

The force’s historic inquiries team is looking at thousands of killings that took place over the 30 years of the Troubles. Families of those who were shot dead have called for members of the Parachute Regiment to be prosecuted.

But Richard Kemp, a former colonel in the Royal Anglian Regiment – which was also in Londonderry on the day – said it was disgraceful that troops faced arrest and potential prosecution.

As many as 20 British Paratroopers could face murder charges for the deaths of Irish protestors on Bloody Sunday in 1972

‘Although I utterly condemn  the unjustified killing that took place on Bloody Sunday, it is  despicable that 41 years later  law officers are planning to prosecute the soldiers involved for murder,’ he said.

‘This ridiculous, politically motivated prosecution is not in the public interest and should not be permitted.’

Colonel Edward Loden commanded the unit involved in the Bloody Sunday shootings

He called for senior officers to face legal action if charges are brought against those who served under them, adding: ‘If these men acted improperly or unlawfully on that day, and charges are brought against them, then charges must also be brought against those who commanded them.’

It is understood the PSNI will begin interviewing military personnel who fired shots on the day in about a year. But the investigation faces serious practical obstacles. Some witnesses have died and some evidence has been lost or destroyed.

The Bloody Sunday Inquiry by Lord Saville, which began in 1998 and published its report in 2010, gathered testimonies about the events of the day. But the evidence cannot be used for any prosecution as soldiers, who spoke to the judge anonymously, were assured their evidence would not be made available to the police.

Prosecutors will have to satisfy themselves that bringing charges is in the public interest.

If prosecutions are brought for murder, manslaughter or other serious crimes, it raises the prospect that soldiers could be put behind bars for actions during a military operation of more than 40 years ago.

At the same time, as a result  of the Good Friday Agreement, terrorists who committed atrocities aimed at the police or the Armed Forces in Ulster have been released from prison.

Patrick Mercer, the independent MP and former infantry officer, said: ‘Justice must be done. But should a prosecution occur, it has got to be weighed very carefully against the Good Friday Agreement.

‘Convicted murderers were pardoned and released.

‘This puts any potential military offenders in an extremely difficult positions and presents the government with a political, social and military landmine.’

The Bloody Sunday Inquiry into one of the most notorious days in the history of the Troubles spent £200million over 12 years examining what happened.

The soldiers gave anonymous evidence at the Saville Inquiry which cannot be used to pursue criminal charges

Lord Saville concluded that those shot by paratroopers during a Roman Catholic civil rights march in the Bogside area of Londonderry were unarmed and that the killings were ‘unjustified and unjustifiable’.

His report prompted an apology to the families of victims by Prime Minister David Cameron.

A PSNI spokesman said: ‘For the investigation to be as comprehensive and effective as possible, police will be asking for public support in the form of witnesses who gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry now making statements to detectives.’
