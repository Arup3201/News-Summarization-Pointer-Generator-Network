Running a marathon is a momentous effort for most people - a once-in-a-lifetime event to tick off the bucket list.

But for Rob Young, 31, from Richmond, south London, it's a daily occurrence. He gets up at 2.45am every morning to run a whole marathon course around Richmond Park before he starts his working day as the manager of a specialist car parts company. 

What makes this all the more impressive is that Rob has had to overcome an incredibly abusive childhood with a father who beat him regularly, followed by a period in care homes, in order to get to this place.

Until the age of six, Rob lived in Yorkshire with his mother and sister under his father's reign of terror - not even the family dog was safe from the daily violent outbursts, which saw his sister sexually abused and him thrown down stairs in a suitcase. 

He said: 'As a young child I was witness to some terrible things, which most people would find hard to imagine or understand.

'I was beaten pretty much every day, with anything that easily came to my father's hand.

'It could be a slipper, a stick or a plank of wood, today I still have quite a number of scars on my body from these beatings.  

'Sometimes my father would zip me into a suitcase and push me down the stairs, this was one of the milder things I had to endure, though. 

'The worst thing was being dangled over the banister at the top of the stairs by one leg - he used to tell me that if I made any noise at all or if I cried he would drop me.' 

The breaking point came one evening when Rob was six years old - his father returned home and started a bout of violence that ended with Rob being hung with a rope. 

He said: 'He tied a rope around my neck from which he hung me on an old-fashioned coat hanger near the front door.  

Happily ever after: Rob Young now lives in Richmond, south London, with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz, 26, and son Alexander-Lui Julian Young, 21 months

'I remember the feeling of having no air to breathe and I struggled as my father held my legs, it became very scary until he decided to let me down.' 

Rob's mother decided that enough was enough and fled the family home with her two children in tow. 

Sadly, she was unable to care for them and while Rob's sister was sent to live with an aunt, he was put in a care home. 

What followed was an incredibly tough few years, as he struggled to make his voice heard among hundreds of other lost children while being passed from care home to care home. 

Rob said: 'That was very difficult, because I was lumped in there with a lot of other children, very troubled children who  were often a lot older than me, who bullied each other and who are from very disruptive backgrounds.

'The people who work in these places often don’t know how to cope and many also just see it as a job. 

'The reason that a lot of these children behave the way they do is because the only way to get attention is by acting up - by getting into trouble - that’s the only way anyone will ever notice you.

Rob Young runs a marathon every day and takes part in group marathons most weekends 

'I was like that too for a while, but then I remember the moment that I switched – I must have been about eight or nine years old and someone said to me: "You’re going to turn out just like your dad."

'It was like a switch flipped in my head, I thought: "I’m not going to be like him, I’m never going to end up like that."

'From then on I just decided to throw myself into school and sport. 

'Around that time I had just started going to school properly, I hadn't been sent that often until then, and I really enjoyed all of the sports lessons.'

The real moment of change in Rob's life came when he was around 11 years old and he was fostered by the deputy headmaster of a top private school. 

From that day, he was given a second chance at life - learning behavioural and academic skills that would help him to pave his way through life. 

He said: 'When I was in year seven, this wonderful man – a head teacher of a private school - came and took me in. 

'He totally changed my life.

'He taught me everything; from how to set a table, to how to eat a six-course meal, to holding an adult conversation and helped me to get all of my exams, which include good GCSEs and A-Levels. 

Rob Young decided to try and run 367 marathons in 365 days while watching television with his with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz one evening earlier this year - he had never run a marathon until then 

'I think of him as my real father.'

'To this day I believe he enabled me to be the person I am today - all my best aspects derived from his tutorage.' 

Fast-forward more than a decade and Rob lives in Richmond with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz, 26, and his son Alexander-Lui Julian Young, 21 months. 

He also has a five-year-old daughter called Olivia from a previous relationship. 

After landing on his feet, the 31-year-old made a decision earlier this year to give something back to children who find themselves in the situation he was once in. 

While watching television with Joanna one evening, Rob decided to take on the humongous challenge of completing 367 marathons in 365 days.

So every morning he gets out of bed at 2.45am and heads down to the marathon track at Richmond park to run 26.2 miles before heading back home to shower and change before work.  

And although many would struggle to find any silver lining in waking before dawn to run such a long way, unlike the rest of us, Rob can eat what he wants, whenever he wants. 

Rob Young takes part in so many marathons these days that he has spare energy that he uses to sing and encourage fellow runners 

He said: 'People tell me that I should probably start eating a certain diet - really healthy food, but to be honest, eating what I fancy has worked for me so far.

'I just eat anything I can get my hands on really - I really like chocolate eclairs, I love Doritos, cakes, biscuits, lots of pasta, I’ll have anything really.

'I eat my recommended 2,500 calories a day and then I also have the 4,000 calories that you should eat when doing a marathon.' 

And the most galling part for anybody who as ever limped through a marathon, wondering if they'll ever manage to make the finishing line, is that Rob quite literally takes them in his stride these days. 

He said: 'They say that you have to slow down your time drastically if you are doing back-to-back marathons, so I have slowed my time to four hours.

'But four hours means that I am pretty much walking over the finish line and can go and play a game of football straight afterwards. 

Rob credits his 21-month-old son Alexander-Liu with helping to inspire him on the early mornings 

'I take part in official marathons regularly as well as doing the Richmond course and I like to sing and  dance to encourage other marathon runners when I’m doing those, because that keeps spirits up when people are flagging.

'I also pick up a few bottles of water at the water stations and then carry them round to other runners.' 

 And while Rob is planning on slowing down the number of marathons he takes part in once he reaches his 367 mark, he has also jokingly tried to convince his fiancée that they should get married during one. 

He said: 'I did suggest to my partner that we should get married and then run a marathon, then everyone from the wedding party could run with us and we could stop for a drink and photos at the different drinks stations and have a party afterwards.' 

But saving that, his main aim is just to raise as much money as possible for charity. 

He said: 'If I can help young people in similar situations and encourage them to make peace with their pasts, then I feel something good has come out of all I have had to endure.'
