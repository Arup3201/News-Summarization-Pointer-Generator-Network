Lauren Oliver, 25, has described her daughter Harper (pictured together) as her 'little miracle' after giving birth to her just hours after being stabbed

A mother has told of her delight of her ‘miracle’ baby after she gave birth by emergency c-section just hours after being stabbed in the stomach.

Lauren Oliver, 25, was heavily pregnant when she suffered multiple stabs wounds in the alleged attempted murder attack at her home in Belton, Lincolnshire.

Due to her injuries, doctors performed an emergency caesarean and her daughter, Harper, was delivered just hours later.

The newborn, who was delivered at 33 weeks weighing 4lbs 1oz, remains in intensive care although both she and her mother are said to be ‘doing well’.

Miss Harper, who is already a mother to six-year-old Ruby, said the baby girl is ‘her little miracle’.

The riding instructor said: ‘Harper is doing really well, she’s a fighter.

‘We’ve had loads of people coming to see us, loads of cards, loads of support.

‘I’m just so happy everything has turned out okay. Of course there was a moment when I thought she couldn’t live to be a week old so it’s really good to see her doing so well.

‘She was just so tiny when she was born, the size of a little doll.

‘I’ve been able to hold her quite a bit when they take her out of the incubator, and she is taking milk.

‘She was on a ventilator for the first four days of her life but thankfully she’s breathing on her own now, that’s a real relief.

‘It didn’t feel real when I held her for the first time. It was just the best feeling ever. I didn’t think she would be there. I can’t describe how happy I was.

‘She’s perfect. We are both so lucky. ‘Ruby absolutely loves her and can’t wait for us all to go home.

‘At the moment we have no idea when that will be. We are just taking one day at a time.’

Nicholas James Leaning, 28, of 
Scunthorpe, has been charged with one count of attempted murder and one 
count of attempted child destruction in connection with the alleged attack last 
Wednesday.

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Hull Crown Court, East Yorkshire on Monday.

Neighbours of the young mother have spoken of their shock of the alleged attack, and their relief that both are now on the mend.

Next-door neighbour Matthew Rawson, 28, said: ‘Lauren is a fun and bubbly girl...very genuine and a great mum.

‘My kids adore her. We’re a close community and we are all so relieved they are both fine. Nothing like that’s happened round here before.’

Harper, who was delivered at 33 weeks weighing 4lbs 1oz, remains in intensive care although both she and Miss Oliver are said to be 'doing well'. A man has been charged in connection with the alleged attack

Another 50-year old neighbour told how Miss Oliver was taken to hospital by ambulance as the air ambulance hovered overhead.

The woman, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘I can’t imagine how her family feel and what they must have gone through. Lauren’s a hardworking young mum and a friend of my daughter’s.

‘Thank goodness they made it through. Someone must have been watching out for them that day.’

Police are continuing to appeal for anyone with information to come forward, particularly those with knowledge of a silver Ford Focus and red Seat Leon which may have been seen in the Ashtree Close area on the day of the alleged assault.
