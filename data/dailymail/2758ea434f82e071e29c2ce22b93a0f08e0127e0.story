He may be Mr Nasty on Strictly … but when it comes to his dog, Craig Revel Horwood has a much softer side.

The star has spoken of his devastation after learning his pet has a serious heart condition and does not have long left to live.

Sophie, a rescued cavalier King Charles spaniel, has just turned 13 – making her 68 in human years.

Devastated: The Strictly Come Dancing judge, who shares Sophie with his boyfriend Damon Scott, said he is horrified at the thought of planning for their pet’s death

The Strictly Come Dancing judge, who shares Sophie with his boyfriend Damon Scott, said he is horrified at the thought of planning for their pet’s death.

Revel Horwood, 49, said: ‘I am so upset. We don’t want her to go anywhere. She acts like a pup. You know it’s imminent, but you have to take one day at a time and enjoy it.

‘The love she gives back is enormous. It is going to be absolutely devastating. Damon is going to be an absolute mess because he is the one who saved her.’

Scott, 35, a 2007 runner-up on Britain’s Got Talent, rescued Sophie five years ago after finding her ‘lying in her own filth’. She has come close to death more than once and has to take eight tablets a day, at a cost of £150 a month.

Revel Horwood said: ‘I have never been broody for children. So it comes as a complete surprise to me to find out how much I love her.

‘I never thought I’d miss a pet so much when I’m away. I have been on the road travelling so I have never been able to have a dog. Now I am unbelievably in love with her. We both think of her as our daughter.

‘And she has to take so many tablets, you have to look after her like a baby in a way.’

Sophie sleeps on her own full-size bed and was given a pink tutu for her birthday last week. Revel Horwood, known as ‘Mr Nasty’ on Strictly, admitted: ‘Having Sophie has calmed me down a little bit. It might be true that I’m less spiky on Strictly as a result.’

Sophie, who is deaf, has a badly inflamed heart and has no teeth, so her tongue lolls out of her mouth.

But her sweet nature has won her many fans. She appeared on Strictly spin-off It Takes Two last week, and has her own YouTube video with 86,817 hits. The couple, who live near Andover, Hampshire, have been told she is unlikely to survive the year. They are on a waiting list to adopt another dog. Revel Horwood said: ‘All these dogs need is a little love and someone with enough money to look after them.’
