It is 20 years since their last album, but it appears Pink Floyd can still show their younger rivals a thing or two.

For the veteran rock band’s new release has become the most pre-ordered album ever on the Amazon website.

The Endless River has already beaten boyband One Direction’s 2013 album Midnight Memories, although Amazon refused to say how many orders it has for commercial reasons.

Other albums in the top all-time Amazon pre-orders list include Swing Both Ways by Robbie Williams, Progress by Take That and Susan Boyle’s I Dreamed A Dream, as well as two releases by Coldplay, Ghost Stories and X&Y. 

Pink Floyd achieved worldwide fame with the 1973 album Dark Side Of The Moon but have not released an album since The Division Bell in 1994.

Since then, keyboard player Rick Wright has died, as has founder member Syd Barrett, who left the band in 1968 after two albums.

The Endless River, their 15th studio album, features singer and guitarist Dave Gilmour, 68, and drummer Nick Mason, 70, but not bassist Roger Waters, 71, who quit the group 30 years ago.

It is an instrumental double album of 18 tracks and was created as a tribute to Wright, who died from cancer aged 65 in 2008, using unreleased sessions he recorded in 1993 and 1994.

In a recent interview, Gilmour warned that the new Floyd material may not appeal to younger listeners – because the entire album should be listened to in one sitting rather than track by track.

He told MOJO magazine: ‘My struggle is to try to not have it over-hyped. All the powers that be that surround us, the record companies and management, want to make a huge, huge, huge fuss and I want to make a bit of a fuss, but I want people to understand where this is coming from and why it’s not Dark Side of The Moon or even The Division Bell.

‘Unapologetically, this is for the generation that wants to put its headphones on, lie in a beanbag, or whatever, and get off on a piece of music for an extended period of time. You could say it’s not for the iTunes, downloading-individual-tracks generation. But there are a lot of people who’ll get a lot of enjoyment out of this.’
