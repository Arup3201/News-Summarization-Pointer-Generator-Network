An underwear clad rapist, 49, wound up naked when snagged his skivvies on a fence while fleeing police, later managing to steal some pants he found on the run.

Salem police say the man, James E. Bufford, 49, fled out the back door of a house in his undies when they found him Tuesday.

Officers following him through yards and bushes soon realized he was no longer wearing anything at all.

When officers finally caught up with him, he had pants on.

Lt. Dave Okada told the Salem Statesman Journal the suspect apparently lost the underwear scrambling over a fence and then grabbed the pants somewhere.

Police say 49-year-old Bufford was wanted on a warrant alleging failure to register as a sex offender. He now also faces burglary, theft, escape and other charges.

It's unclear if he has a lawyer who could be reached for comment.

A K-9 unit was enlisted to help the police search for Buifford.

He was eventually discovered in a home under renovation.

Bufford realized that a police dog was after him and finally surrendered.
