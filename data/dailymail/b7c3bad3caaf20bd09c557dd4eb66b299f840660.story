Demonstrators took to the streets of Berkeley, California for yet another march Monday night to protest the police-related deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. 

The march brought traffic to a crawl on both directions  of Interstate 80 just before 9pm local time, as hundreds of protesters walked out onto the freeway.

Police were eventually able to break up the group, but cops and protesters faced off again on a pedestrian bridge stretching across the major thoroughfare. 

The downtown Berkeley BART station was also shut down, and protesters in nearby Emeryville were pictured dramatically laying down on the tracks in front of Amtrak trains.

Monday's protest follows two nights of violence and vandalism in Berkeley and Oakland, as a few rogue demonstrators broke into local businesses to loot and the California Highway Patrol deployed tear gas to combat some protesters who attacked the cops with explosives. 

Eleven protesters were arrested in marches on Saturday and Sunday and appeared for their first arraignments Monday afternoon.  

Activists in the Bay Area have been holding marches every night since last Wednesday, when a State Island grand jury decided not to indict the NYPD officer responsible for killing Garner with an illegal chokehold. 

On Sunday, opportunistic thieves joined the demonstrations and broke into a RadioShack to loot the store for pricey gadgets.

History: Berkeley has historically been the center for civil disobedience in the U.S., and was especially active for protests during the Vietnam War. Because of that, local police officers are not allowed to have patrol dogs, stun guns or helicopters. Above a protest confronts a line of Berkeley police officers on Monday

A doctor who tried to stop the looting was injured when one of the thieves hit him in the head with a hammer. 

The California Highway Patrol also deployed tear gas against protesters on Sunday after explosives were thrown at them.

Tear gas was also used against the protesters on Saturday, which Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates admits may have been an overreaction.

Police kept a noticeably wider distance  on Sunday, but that only led to more businesses getting vandalized. 

On Monday, many business owners closed early and boarded up in preparation for the march, and nearby UC Berkeley sent out an email to staff suggesting they leave campus by 4:30pm.

'It was really disturbing,' Bates said of the weekend protests, as reported by ABC 7. 'It turned violent and it turned violent in a way that we haven't seen here for a long, long time. Over the weekend, over 16 various stores were trashed, not just major businesses, but small businesses.'

Berkeley has a  history of civil disobedience, as one of the focal point for protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s.

Because of this history, local police are not allowed to have search dogs, stun guns or helicopters.   

'The people in the Bay Area are sensitive to worldwide issues,' Bates said, according to NBC Bay Area. 'Unfortunately, there is a small element that uses violence at times to make their point.'
