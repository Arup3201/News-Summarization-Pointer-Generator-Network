A four-year-old girl has become the youngest person ever to pass a music exam – and was awarded a merit.

Tammy Kenyon from Heaton Mersey, Stockport, got top marks on her Grade Two music theatre exam, performing Disney and musical songs at a level well beyond her tender age.

Her mother Rebecca Chambers, 39, a music examiner and singing teacher, said her daughter has shown musical ability since the age of two and sings everything 'from Elvis to classical'.

Child prodigy: Tammy Kenyon is only four years old but has already passed her Grade Two music theatre qualification with flying colours - the youngest ever to do so

Tammy performed in front of examiners at London College of Music at the University of West London and was awarded a 76 per cent pass mark.

Ms Chambers said: ‘I'm a musician so I think that's why Tammy has become so good so quickly. She lives with music every day.

‘You don't realise how much children absorb - yes she's had an advantage because of my background, but still, for a four-year-old, it's incredible. She's been singing her head off from the age of two.

‘Her repertoire is just staggering - she knows everything. Her musical memory is incredible. From Elvis to classical music, she knows it all.’

Tammy's exam saw her perform two 
pieces and act out the stories behind the lyrics, treating examiners to 
renditions of A Whole New World, from Disney classic Aladdin, and 
Tomorrow, from the musical Annie.

Tammy,
 a pupil at Didsbury Road Primary School, was then questioned about the 
characters and the emotions evoked by each piece of music.

Rebecca
 said: ‘When I'm teaching and one of my pupils stops singing, you can 
hear Tammy in the background carrying on the song. I can see so much 
development in her.

'Her
 pitch is perfect and her rhythm is just so natural. The nice thing 
about the exam is that she didn't realise it was an exam, I just told 
her to go and sing to the nice lady - and she did.'

Like mother, like daughter: Tammy's mother Rebecca Chambers is a music examiner herself and say her daughter began singing at the tender age of two

‘I'm very proud of her and excited about her capability and potential, but I'm not a pushy parent. She's still just a child, I don't want to take the enjoyment out of it.

‘If she wants to continue it when she's older, she can do it on her own terms.’

A spokesman for the London College of Music said: ‘The Grade Two music theatre exam combines singing and dramatic skills in integrated performances, and is a remarkable achievement for a girl of such a young age.

‘We would like to congratulate Tammy on her success, and wish her enjoyment and success in her music theatre studies.’
