'Idiot.'

That was the common reaction of the majority of his teammates after the entire El Paso Chihuahuas baseball team convinced former Atlanta Braves slugger - and current Chihuahuas outfielder - Jeff Francoeur that another one of their teammates was deaf.

Not only did they convince Francoeur that pitcher Jorge Reyes was deaf, but they did so for an entire month - and videotaped the entire prank.

The hilarious video explains the great lengths to which the team went to keep the gag going - and their disbelief that Francoeur is dumb enough to buy into it due to the simple fact that it would be incredibly hard for a baseball player - a pitcher, no less - to be deaf and play baseball.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Got ya: This is the moment Jeff Francoeur (center) realized his entire team had been lying to him for over a month

Veteran: Francoeur has played for five MLB teams and won the Gold Glove in 2007

Not deaf: Reyes' wife told Francoeur that the two communicated by text message and 'hand signals' - and he bought it

In an interview with Francoeur shown in the film, he's asked what it's been like to play with Reyes.

'It's been a lot of fun to play with Jorge,' he says. 'He's overcome obviously a lot. Being a deaf baseball player is very hard in this game and to see the way he's done it and handled himself has been awesome.'

The very next scene is Reyes.

'Hello, my name is Jorge Reyes and I'm definitely not deaf,' Reyes explains.

Teammates then share with the filmmaker - first-baseman Cody Decker - some hilarious examples of how Francoeur getting duped by Reyes.

Team manager Pat Murphy told a story about how someone on the team yelled 'heads up' and everyone reacted except Reyes.

Mockery: Francoeur's teammates joke about the hand signals and over enunciation of words he would often use to communicate with Reyes

'Idiot': Infielder Ryan Jackson seemed genuinely disappointed in how much of an 'idiot' Francoeur was to believe Reyes was deaf

'God, it's amazing - [Reyes] is the only one who didn't move,' Murphy quotes Francoeur as saying after the incident.

In another example, Francoeur asks Murphy how Reyes communicates with the catcher - an important aspect of pitching at any level.

'He just mouths words to him,' Murphy explained.

In one of the more unbelievable instances where Francoeur didn't realize Reyes wasn't deaf happened at a restaurant when he met Reyes, Reyes' wife and some other players for dinner.Â 

Baker explains that he had to tip the waitress serving the group extra to get her to act like Reyes was deaf as long as Francoeur was in the restaurant.

At one point, Francoeur asked Reyes' wife how she communicates with her husband. She told him they communicated through text messages and 'hand signals.'

'Hand signals. Not even sign language. Hand signals,' Decker jokes.

Roll credits: Decker produced the hilarious video and put it on Youtube where it already has had more than 400,000 views

Good sport: Francoeur managed to laugh at himself a little bit after he was let in on the big secret

The end of the video shows the big reveal: The team is gathered in the clubhouse watching the video Decker had compiled of the prank as Francoeur is sitting in the middle of the group. When the video gets to the part where Reyes says 'Hello, my name is Jorge Reyes and I'm definitely not deaf,' Francoeur turns beat red as all of his teammates laugh hysterically.

Francoeur recently signed a contract with the San Diego Padres and was assigned to the club's AAA team, the Chihuahuas. He's played for five Major League Baseball teams, including the Atlanta Braves and the New York Mets. In 2007, he won the Gold Glove Award.
