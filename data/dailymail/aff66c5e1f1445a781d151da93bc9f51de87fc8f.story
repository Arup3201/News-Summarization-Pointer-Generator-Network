This is the horrific moment a woman is crushed between three cars as she tries to cross a busy road - and miraculously escapes unscathed.

The crash, captured on a shop’s CCTV cameras, shows the woman wearing white attempting to cross the road moments before three cars collide  - sending one careering into a line of parked vehicles.

The accident brought the busy Alum Rock Road, in Birmingham, to a standstill as shoppers feared the worst.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The woman - seen here circled and wearing white and behind the silver car at the top right hand of the screen - moves to cross the road between the two cars

As she moves out from behind the silver car, suddenly a red car appears and heads quickly up the street. At the same time, a driver pulls out of the junction

With no time to move, the woman is crushed between the silver, black and red car while shocked passers by can only watch - completely helpless

Passers by could only watch in horror as a red car rammed the stationary silver car into the woman who was left pinned underneath the crumpled wreckage.

Incredibly, the woman  - whose identity is unknown - escaped with 'non-life threatening head injuries' in the pile up, which happened at 3.40pm on October 20.

Nobody has yet been arrested for the crash.

Another woman and a 10-year-old boy were also injured in the pile-up but are expected to make a full recovery.

The 43-second clip has attracted over 23,000 hits since it was uploaded to YouTube.
