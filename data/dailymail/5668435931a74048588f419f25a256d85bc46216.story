England striker Jermain Defoe returned flew back to England today after learning that his father had died after losing his battle with throat cancer.

The Tottenham striker left England's hotel ten minutes before the rest of the squad boarded a coach for their first training session in Poland having only arrived in the country on Wednesday evening.

Defoe – dressed in jeans, trainers and a black top – was escorted from the Stary Hotel by an FA chaperone and taken by car to Krakow airport for a flight back to the UK.

The Daily Mail has learned that 
England manager Roy Hodgson was 'aware' of the illness affecting Defoe's
47-year-old father and knew there was a possibility that the player 
might have to return home to be with family and friends sometime during 
the tournament.

'Jermain's father had been ill for some time,' said an FA source.

'He had been treated for throat cancer
at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London for some time so this was not a
bolt from the blue for Jermain.

'He was told the sad news that his father had passed away overnight and we made plans for him to fly home as soon as possible.

'Jermain is a strong lad and was quite
pragmatic about events. Roy Hodgson felt it was right that he flew back
immediately to be with his famly.

'He will miss at least two days of 
training prior to the opening match against France on Monday therefore 
we do not know if he will play any part in that game.'

As Defoe flew home his England 
teammates took part in a 'closed' training session in Krakow before 
manager Roy Hodgson was due to speak to the media this afternoon.

Eight years ago it was revealed that 
Defoe's dreadlocked father Jimmy, 39 — who split with Jermain's mum when
he was a baby — was living on £53.05 a week benefit.

The jobless decorator lived in a small
shared flat in Forest Gate, East London, just six miles from where his 
millionaire son was then living with his mother Sandra.

Jimmy was reportedly not receiving any
financial help from Jermain but said at the time: 'I am so proud of 
him. He is a fantastic player. But we live in different worlds.'

Jimmy married Sandra in 1981 but the couple split soon after Jermain was born in 1982.

Defoe then stayed with his mother who has since remarried.

Tottenham Hotspur released a 
statement on the club's website which said: 'Jermain Defoe has returned 
home from the England squad base in Poland this morning after receiving 
the sad news of the passing away of his father overnight.

'Everyone at the Club sends their sincere condolences to Jermain and his family.'

The FA said in a statement 'Jermain 
will re-join the England Euro squad in due course. There will be no 
replacement player called in.

'We would ask all media to respect Jermain and his family's privacy at this difficult time.'

Who's who: (back row, left to right) Andy Carroll, Phil Jones, John Terry, Rob Green, Joe Hart, Jack Butland, Joleon Lescott, Martin Kelly, Danny Welbeck (second row) Gary Neville (coach), Ray Lewington (assistant manager), Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Glen Johnson, Scott Parker, Phil Jagielka, Stewart Downing, Ray Clemence (goalkeeping coach), Dave Watson (goalkeeping coach), (front row) Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jermain Defoe, Theo Walcott, Steven Gerrard, Roy Hodgson (manager), Wayne Rooney, Ashley Cole, Ashley Young, Leighton Baines

The Football Association and England manager Roy Hodgson have said they will offer Defoe as much time off as he needs and still view him as a central component of the squad, even though he was unlikely to start against France.

Roy Hodgson was aware of Defoe's father's condition ahead of his death and has said he will support the player

It was Defoe whose goal against Slovenia in the last World Cup propelled England into the knockout phase, although he has been a peripheral figure for much of the European Championship qualifying campaign after scoring a hat-trick in the win over Bulgaria in September 2010.

With Wayne Rooney suspended, either Danny Welbeck or Andy Carroll will get the nod against the French, with Ashley Young expected to operate just behind.

In 2009 Defoe's brother, Jade, was 
killed following a street attack in Leytonstone, east London, when his 
skull was fractured and suffered devastating brain damage.

Jimmy Defoe left the brothers' mother, Sandra, when Jermain was just a toddler.

Another
of Defoe's siblings, Shane, 25, had his sentencing for possession of a 
lock knife and cannabis, adjourned today due to the family's 
bereavement.

Tottenham 
striker Defoe has 47 caps but has never played a full 90 minutes for 
England, earning instead a reputation as a match-changing 
super-substitute.
