A 52-year-old man has been arrested after he allegedly stabbed his air stewardess girlfriend to death during his first visit to meet her family.

Joseph Karr flew in from California to visit the home of 43-year-old Kelly Turner in south west Austin, Texas. 

He is then suspected of murdering her during the trip.

Police found the body of the Southwest Airlines flight attendant on Saturday morning and arrested Karr after they found him in a nearby field. 

Arrested: Joseph Karr flew in from California to visit the home of 43-year-old Kelly Turner in south west Austin, Texas. He is then suspect of stabbing her

Career: She traveled all over the country as a flight attendant for Southwest Airlines

He is now being held in Travis County Jail facing first degree murder charges. 

Her relatives said that they had dinner with Karr on Wednesday when he arrived in Texas and said he was 'very quiet' but did not notice anything 'disturbing'. 

Sister Barbara Shannon, who was at the dinner told KVUE: 'That beautiful smile. When she walked into a room she just lit up the room with her smile. 

'She always saw something good in every person.

'I didn't pick up on anything that disturbed me, I noticed he was quiet, he was very quiet.'

Turner graduated from Westlake High School, before going on to study at The University of Texas in Austin. She flew all over the country as a flight attendant for Southwest.
