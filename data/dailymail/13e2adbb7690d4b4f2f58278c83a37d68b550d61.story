Chelsea Clinton took a front-row seat for the memorial service of Nelson Mandela on Tuesday alongside her parents Bill and Hillary - while former President Jimmy Carter was relegated to a back row, corner pew.

Former first daughter Chelsea, a 33-year-old occasional TV presenter who also works for the Clinton Foundation, sat alongside major world leaders at the historic event.

Carter, who is part of a global initiative for peace started by Mandela called The Elders, looked a little forlorn to have been separated from other former U.S. presidents in the back row during the historic event.

Former president Bill Clinton enjoyed
 a close relationship with Mandela, calling the South African leader 'a 
great friend'. In 1998, then President Clinton made the first visit by 
an American president to South Africa.

Clinton revealed in a lengthy tribute in Vanity Fair
 in 2007, that during his time in the White House, he took several calls
 from Mandela and at the end of each call, the South African leader 
would ask to speak to his daughter and wife.

Following Mandela's death, Bill Clinton said: 'Today the world has lost one of its 
most important leaders and one of its finest human beings. And Hillary, 
Chelsea and I have lost a true friend.

'History will remember Nelson Mandela as a champion for human dignity and freedom, for peace and reconciliation.

'We
 will remember him as a man of uncommon grace and compassion, for whom 
abandoning bitterness and embracing adversaries was not just a political
 strategy but a way of life.'

Jimmy Carter also enjoyed a special bond with Mandela and is a global leader of a group brought together by the South African leader in 2007.

Chaired by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the group works together for peace and human rights.

Mandela's widow Graca Machel is also a member along with conflict mediator Lakhdar Brahimi and Mary Robinson, the first woman president of Ireland.

Former President Carter told NBC News on Monday that Nelson Mandela belongs in the league of Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Teresa.

The 39th president said: 'I think that Nelson would go down in history as one of the leading people of the century.'

President Obama along with First Lady Michelle led an American 
delegation of former presidents and their families including the Clintons, George W Bush, 
his wife Laura and Jimmy Carter.

all traveled to Johannesburg together on Air Force One.

Mr Clinton, Mr 
Carter and his wife Rosalynn all traveled separately to the event.

Carter, the 40th president of the 
United States and the earliest-serving of the five living Presidents, 
was part of a conference group that Mandela created called 'The Elders' 
and Carter traveled with some others from that group.

Ben
 Rhodes, White House deputy national security adviser for strategic 
communications, said that the President and First lady Michelle spent 
time with the Bushes and Secretary Clinton on board Air Force One.

They are said to have reflected on their experiences meeting Mr Mandela.

Mr Bush visited the press cabin twice 
for off the record conversations during the flight.

Mr Clinton attended a
 charity event in Rio de Janeiro prior to Mr Mandela's memorial service 
and has traveled separately.

George
 H.W. Bush is the only American president who will not attend. His 
spokesman said the 89-year-old is no longer is able to travel long 
distances.
