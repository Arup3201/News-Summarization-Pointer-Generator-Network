Wilfried Zaha believes he can still have a future at Manchester United, provided the new manager gives him a chance to flourish.

The young winger struggled for opportunities under David Moyes, making just two Premier League appearances for United, and was eventually loaned to Cardiff City.

And looking at Raheem Sterling's impact at Liverpool this season, he is hoping someone can come in and replicate Brendan Rodgers' trust.

Struggled to fit in: Wilfried Zaha made just two Premier League appearances for Manchester United

Trust: Having failed to shine under David Moyes, Zaha believes the trust of a manager like Brendan Rodgers can help him kick on like Raheem Sterling has this season

'You need the manager to trust and that was not the case [under David Moyes,' Zaha told the Sun on Sunday.

'Raheem Sterling went through a tough period at Liverpool and there was talk of him going out on loan.

'But Brendan Rodgers trusted him and he was allowed to get that experience and pull through.'

Signed from Crystal Palace last January before returning on loan, Zaha has been linked with a return to Selhurst Park.

But the 21-year-old believes he can impress the new United boss, expected to be Louis van Gaal.
