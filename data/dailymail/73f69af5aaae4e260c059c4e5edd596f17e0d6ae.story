A serial cheater who was married to two women at the same time will not be prosecuted for bigamy- even though his first wife reported him to the police.

Tatiana Ochoa and Kenneth DeCesare tied the knot in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2011, two years after they spoke over the telephone in a job interview

After a rocky start to their marriage, where DeCesare would spend days away from home at a time, they decided to separate - but did not divorce.

First wife: Tatiana Ochoa and Kenneth DeCesare tied the knot in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2011. They separated after a rocky start to the relationship, but Miss Ochoa soon discovered he married someone else

Devastated: Miss Ochoa said there were no words that could hurt her as much when she found out DeCesare was married to another woman, so she decided to report the matter to the police

Months later Miss Ochoa was devastated when she found out he had wed another woman, even though they still were legally married.

She told WKMG Local 6 that a friend found court documents proving DeCesare had married Alicia Fagan in September.

He had been married to the two women at the same time for nine months.  

'To hear that he married someone else, I don't think there are other words that a person could hear that could hurt as much,' she said. 

Miss Ochoa then reported DeCesare to the police, saying he had committed bigamy, a felony that carries a five year prison sentence. 

He even admitted the crime in a post on his blog called 'The Mistake of Ken DeCesare'. 

He wrote: 'On a drug binge, I did not realize what I was doing, but I actually married a woman while I was already married – Upon realizing what I had done, I immediately told her that I could not be with her & we dissolved the marriage (hence the technically having been married three times).

'In my own defense, most of these poor decisions were made under the influence of and/or in the pursuit of substance abuse – therefore incoherent. 

'However, to me, that is no excuse for my personal failings. I lied to people. I took from others. I looked the other way while my employees misled clients. 

'I cheated profusely in relationships. I offered financial payout to women in exchange for pleasure (never outright prostitution). Basically, I became a filthy & unrecognizable monster.' 

Miss Ochoa filed a complaint with the Orange County Sheriff's Office. In the incident report, Deputy Andrea Jacobsen wrote, 'Kenneth Moulton DeCesare has committed the crime of bigamy' and indicated a criminal charge would be filed with the state attorney's office.

But before it was processed, Orange County authorities sent the complaint to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, where DeCesare's second marriage occurred.

Proceedings: Miss Ochoa (left) filed a complaint, but detectives found that DeCesare's (right) second wife, Alicia Fagan, was filing for divorce and did not want to prosecute, so they dropped the case 

Osceola County sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain said they initially investigated what had happened.

However they soon discovered that DeCesare's second wife Alicia Fagan was in the process of divorcing him and did not want to participate in the investigation.

Fagan told Local 6: 'He's dead to me, buried with a tombstone. I had no reason to suspect he was married.' 

Lizasuain added: 'The second wife, who would have been the victim, has declined to prosecute; therefore our detectives closed the case.'

Under Florida law, the original marriage is the only valid one.

Even though he has admitted to the crime online and authorities have received a complaint, bigamists in Florida are rarely prosecuted. 

Since 2000, only 14 defendants were prosecuted for bigamy in Orange, Brevard, Volusia and Lake Counties. Only one, Leonard Hare, was sentenced to prison, where he served 9 months.

In response, DeCesare said he has now been admitted into a drug treatment program.

In an earlier blog post he wrote: 'Being an entrepreneur is who I am. Being a good person is who I want to be.'

Truth: DeCesare said he married the second woman during a 'drug binge' and has now been admitted into a drug treatment program. He admitted he had committed bigamy in a post on his blog
