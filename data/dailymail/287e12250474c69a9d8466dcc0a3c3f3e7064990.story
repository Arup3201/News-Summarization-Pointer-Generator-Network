Millions of families have been misled over ‘bargain’ prices on sale items such as furniture and carpets, it has been revealed.

Six high street retailers are accused of artificially inflating prices for a short period in order to exaggerate sale cuts.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has refused to name the firms but has demanded they sign legal undertakings to prevent customers paying too much for high value items such as three-piece suites, dining tables, flooring and beds.

Six high street retailers are accused of artificially inflating prices for a short period in order to exaggerate sale cuts

The watchdog found ‘systematic’ examples of artificially inflated prices that were used as a benchmark figure to advertise bogus savings of 50 per cent or more.

Another scam involved advertising apparently low prices, with claims that the product would become much more expensive after the sale was over.

Firms also used unrealistic recommended retail prices, apparently set by manufacturers, to make the store’s charge look cheaper than it really was.

The OFT found that stores would typically charge the original higher price on just five per cent of the products at a tiny number of stores.

Very few items, if any, were sold at this original price. However, it was then used to set a benchmark for huge price reduction claims.

In all cases, no explanation of how and when these higher prices were established was provided.

The OFT has written to the six retailers asking them to stop using pricing practices that mislead consumers, giving them until autumn to respond.

A study of 166 people by experts at consultants London Economics found that these retail tactics often fool customers into paying more

The investigation comes ahead of the bank holiday weekend, a busy trading period for home furnishing retailers often marked by heavy sales promotions.

And it comes days after Tesco was fined £300,000 over a misleading half-price offer on strawberries in hundreds of stores around the country.

OFT director Gaucho Rasmussen said: ‘OFT research has found that reference pricing can mislead consumers into thinking the item they have bought is of higher value and quality, pressure them to buy there and then so they don’t “miss out” on the deal and also impair their judgment, as buying an item immediately means they do not get the chance to search the market for the real best deals.

‘We have contacted a number of carpet and furniture retailers asking them to review their pricing practices and sign legally enforceable undertakings.

‘This bank holiday sale season we would recommend that consumers ask sales staff when and for how long the reference price was used and also how many sales they achieved at this price. 

‘This will help them to determine whether they are getting a good deal.’ The move against the furniture stores is part of a wider crackdown by the OFT’s investigators on misleading prices.

Other scams under the spotlight include so-called drip pricing, where customers are tempted by an apparently low headline price in the store, only to find that other compulsory charges follow.

‘Bait pricing’, when few or no items are actually available at the advertised discount, and ‘free’ offers that require a series of other fees will also be targeted.

A study of 166 people by experts at consultants London Economics found that these retail tactics often fool customers into paying more.

It found that ‘the worst culprits’ were  drip pricing and time-limited offers – a  ploy used often by furniture outlets to falsely claim  that a deal is available only for a  short period.

Generally people ended up paying too much and failing to shop around for a better deal, they found.
