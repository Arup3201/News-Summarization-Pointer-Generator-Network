Some say graphene is set to be the next super-material, while others claim the humble bamboo could be used in textiles and construction.

But perhaps a sweeter option would be to open store cupboards and break out the chocolate, as this Youtube user from Zurich has done.

The user, known as Mike C, and his girlfriend created an entire quadcopter out of chocolate - and it not only flies, but it’s edible as well.

Forget Amazon's drones that can deliver your food - now you can cut out the middle man and have a drone made of food instead. Mike and his girlfriend claim this is the world's first quadcopter made of chocolate that not only flies but can be eaten after it has landed

On his DIY Drones blog Mike revealed how his love of quadcopters and his girlfriend’s love of baking combined to give rise to the invention.

- 1kg (2.2lbs) of dark chocolate

- 100g (3.5 ounces) of white chocolate

- 1 x Naza M V2 (autopilot system)

- 4 x Sunnysky X2216 (motor)

- 4 x Turnigy Plush 25A ESC (speed controller)

‘I was sceptical at first,’ he wrote.

‘Chocolate is not as stable as aluminium or carbon - which are typically used for copter frames.’

But the duo persevered, and the end result is something that, amazingly, is able to take flight without falling apart.

As Mike explains, they began by making a silicon mould in the shape of a quadcopter, which is essentially a cross.

The 
motors, flight controller and battery were attached to spacers, in order 
to separate them from the chocolate and prevent them heating and melting
 it.

The chocolate was then poured into the mould, which was placed in the fridge until it set.

The copter was taken outside and, much to the amazement of Mike C and his girlfriend, flew without issue.

And they were even able to have a bite to eat when it landed.

‘When you get hungry during the flight sessions you always have something to nibble with you,’ Mike added.

Whether chocolate takes off as the material of choice for future inventions, though, remains to be seen.

Mike and his girlfriend poured 1kg grams (2.2lbs) of melted dark chocolate and 100g (3.5 ounces) of white chocolate into a mould to make the chocolate quadcopter. After they had completed the flight Mike C's girlfriend took a bite of the contraption, proving it was fine to eat
