David Cameron has complained about the 'buggeration factor' of trying to push policies through Whitehall.

The Prime Minister used the colourful phrase as he expressed frustration with the civil service's processes of consultations and reviews.

The word buggeration is defined by the Urban Dictionary as a term 'used to describe a feeling of absolute c*** but with a hint of light-hearted optimism'.

Mr Cameron's remarks echoed Tony Blair's famous phrase about the 'scars on my back' when he spoke about the difficulties of NHS and education reform.

Frustrated: Prime Minister David Cameron has complained about the 'buggeration factor' of trying to push policies through Whitehall

However, the Prime Minister declined to repeat Mr Blair's remark exactly, saying it sounded 'a bit Fifty Shades of Grey'.

In an interview with the Financial Times, the Prime Minister insisted the Conservatives needed another term in power to restore the country's economic fortunes.

'The first thing is finish the job,' he said. 'With a five per cent budget deficit and still too many people unemployed, with growth that hasn't worked its way through so everyone feels the benefits, the job isn't done.

'The ambition is for Britain to be the best place in Europe to start, grow and run a business, schools where we are not lagging in the tables but we're absolutely busting through the top, a welfare system where it pays to work, where you're always better off in work. 

'And from this a sense that the values of the country will have changed to be ones where people feel deep national pride.'

Mr Cameron said Kenneth Clarke, the former chancellor of the exchequer, was crucial in maintaining Cabinet support for austerity measures over the last five years.

'He sat round the cabinet table and said, look, this is going to take longer than you think, stick with it — there's no alternative package.'

Apart from presiding over a recovery led by the private sector Mr Cameron says he hoped to be remembered as the prime minister who resolved two key questions facing Britain.

'One is, does the United Kingdom want to stay together? Yes. Secondly, does the United Kingdom want to stay in a reformed European Union? Yes,' he said.

Mr Cameron said his pledge to hold an EU referendum would mar 'the moment when Britain stops sleepwalking towards the exit'.

'I think that's what's happening now. The British public can see what's happening: Europe is changing before their eyes and they haven't been asked about it,' he said.

He conceded some Conservatives would 'vote to leave altogether' whatever deal he strikes with Brussels on a looser, more trade-based relationship.

But he added: 'I think there can be a coming together after that.'

Mr Cameron sought to dismiss speculation that if reelected, he intends to stand down in 2018 after holding the referendum.

'I'm standing for a full term and that is what I want to serve,' he said.
