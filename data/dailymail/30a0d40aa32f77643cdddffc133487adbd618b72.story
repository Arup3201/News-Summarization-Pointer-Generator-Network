A Georgia teen who was locked up for four years and starved by his cruel parents has been found wandering a Los Angeles weighing just 97 pounds.

Retired Los Angeles police Sgt. Joe Gonzalez spotted 18-year-old Mitch Comer, and couldn't believe the stunted and gaunt teenager was really that old when he found him at a downtown bus station on September 11.

Comer, whose skin was almost translucent, told Gonzalez his stepfather declared on his 18th birthday that he was now a man and put the teen on a bus across the country with $200 in his pocket.

Charged: Paul and Sheila Comer face six charges of child abuse and false imprisonment after Mitch Comer, 18, told police his parents abused him for years and kept him locked  in a room for four years

The frail teenager told detectives that his stepfather drove him to a bus station in Jackson, Mississippi on his 18th birthday and gave him the money, as well as a list of homeless shelters.

The teen told authorities he had suffered years of abuse after being taken out of school in the eighth grade.

The boy told detectives that he was fed small quantities of food and for eight hours every day he was forced to put the top of his head against a wall and stand on his toes with his fingers interlaced behind his head, police said.

Authorities allege the boy was kept in such seclusion that his two younger sisters in the same house did not know what he looked like, Paulding County sheriff's Cpl. Ashley Henson said.

'The sisters haven't seen the brother in over two years,' Henson said. 'They didn't even know what color his hair was.'

Neighbours on the quiet cul-de-sac of two-story brick and vinyl siding homes, about 30 miles outside Atlanta, said the couple kept to themselves and the two girls didn't ride the neighborhood school bus or leave their yard. Neighbours were shocked to discover that the family had a son.

The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have joined the case, Henson added.

Authorities in Los Angeles contacted law enforcement in Georgia, where Paulding County sheriff's deputies had to track down Comer's stepfather and mother because the teen didn't even know his address.

After being interviewed, Paul and Sheila Marie Comer were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment. They were being held without bond and records did not indicate whether the Comers have an attorney.

Sheila Comer’s mother, Diana Powell, of Iowa, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she hadn’t spoken to her daughter in more than a decade and hadn’t seen her grandson since he was a toddler.

Powell told the station that she had feared her daughter and husband abused their children but had no direct evidence.

'They mistreated him something terrible. I got on her case about it and she disappeared from my life,’ she said crying.

Authorities say that they are just at
the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the case and more charges could be 
brought against the parents.

Monica Moore, an investigator with the Paulding County District Attorney’s office, described the 18-year-old victim as small, very timid, and extremely polite.

Moore confirmed that a local family had agreed to house the teenager, according to Channel 2.

A spokesman from Paulding County Public Schools could also not confirm whether the children have ever been enrolled in the school system.

Records show the Comers have lived in almost two dozen different homes during the past two decades. Neighbours said the family had lived at their large Dallas home for at least a few years.

Neighbours Dion Walker and Mea Smith told AJC that their children had played with the Comers’ daughters over the years but that they had never even seen Mitch Comer.

They said they were surprised to learn the family had a son. 'Maybe, when the young girls would stare at us, were they trying to say something?' Walker said. 'Should we have noticed?'

Comer was flown back to Dallas on Wednesday to participate in the investigation and legal proceedings.

His younger sisters, aged 11 and 13-years-old, were taken into protective custody by Paulding County Children's Services.

Paul Comer had his own business repairing home appliances, said next-door neighbor John White. They rarely spoke.

Comer's wife never left the house unless she was with her husband, 
not even to check the mail, White said. Their two daughters would 
sometimes come outside and play, but only in the back yard. Neighbors 
assumed the girls didn't go to school either – they never caught the bus
that picked up other children in the cul-de-sac every morning.

Neighbors said they had no clue the Comers had a son until a detective came knocking at their doors asking questions last week.

'I had no idea, no clue. There were no signs of a son at all,' said Walker, who's lived next to the Comers for two years. 'The few 
occasions we would see them go to the van, it was always the parents and
the two girls.'

Walker said police swarmed the Comers' home last week, arresting the parents and taking both girls into protective custody.

Walker said the Comer family did not take part in neighborhood 
association meetings and their girls never attended the neighborhood 
Halloween block parties.
