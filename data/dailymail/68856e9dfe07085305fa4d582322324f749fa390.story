Head-to-toe feathers, foiled onesies and thousand-pound dresses; it's just another day on the catwalk at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week.

Kicking off proceedings today was feather specialist, Serkan Cura, with a collection that wouldn't look out of place in Big Bird's wardrobe.

The exotic spring/summer 2015 collection was certainly flamboyant and served up goose-feathered coats in an array of bright colours. But the daring designer didn't stop at just coats.

Vibrant feather-covered boots, crop tops and shorts hit the runway, too. Gowns were inspired by the Charleston and came in fluffy ostrich feathers in bold reds, powder blues and mustards.

The Belgian couturier and Jean Paul Gaultier alumni is best known for his fantastic feather creations but that's by no means the only material he can work with.

The exotic SS15 collection  served up goose-feather crop tops, knickers and boots, left, metallic as well as see-through silver trousers and high-necked jackets, and even Barbarella-style foil metallic jumpsuits worn with embellished corsets and glam-rock platform boots

Elsewhere in his show, models wore metallic foiled jumpsuits, structured raffia dresses and sheer crop tops. 

Over at Zuhair Murad was a whole different story. The Beirut-based Lebanese fashion designer, who is loved by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Jennifer Lopez, sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns.

The ethereal gowns, which were decorated with blush pink rosebuds and smatterings of sparkle, will no doubt be gracing the Oscar red carpet next year.

The ornate gowns were sometimes slashed from the chest to the naval, but the long sleeves and floor-length hemlines kept a certain conservatism about them.

The Ralph & Russo runway was a similar story. Watched from the front row by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and her husband, the designers aimed to capture the Goddess of Spring with a majestic collection that they say symbolised nature’s regenerative powers. 

For SS15, the Ralph & Russo muse is an 'exultant deity, whose gifts lend themselves to delight', they say. 

Acclaimed for its excellence in craftsmanship, the maison de couture aims to inspire with eye-catching embellishment, such as petal appliqué and pearl embroidery; the devil really is in the detail.

The colour palette - crisp and most sophisticated - was full of pomegranate pinks, soft mints and cornflower blues. 

The collection, above all, aims to flatter the female form thanks to sheaths of organza, which promise to hug the figure in all the right places.

The show saw the models metamorphose into fairies and nymphs, gracefully collecting blossoms in their structured collars or scattering buds into the folds of their gowns - and Mrs Fernandez-Versini seemed most impressed.
