The BBC Countryfile presenter who won a landmark battle over Corporation ageism is poised to ride to Ed Miliband’s rescue in a showdown with Nigel Farage’s Ukip.

Miriam O’Reilly is being privately billed as Labour’s best hope in next month’s crunch parliamentary by-election in Heywood and Middleton on the outskirts of Rochdale.

Ms O’Reilly – who has become a standard bearer against ageism after winning an age discrimination case against the BBC which axed her from Countryfile – will today bid to become the party’s candidate in the Labour-held seat.

The television presenter, who has close links to Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman, is on a list of potential candidates being quizzed by party officials in London before a final selection decision by local party members in the constituency tomorrow.

Party insiders believe Ms O’Reilly is the candidate to see off Ukip in a bitter fight expected to be dominated by the Rochdale child abuse scandal and the failings of Rochdale Council to protect vulnerable children.

But the move will provoke a bitter internal row amid claims that Labour national bosses are once again trying to ‘parachute in’ a candidate against the wishes of local party members.

The Mail on Sunday has learnt highly regarded solicitor Richard Scorer, who represents some of the Rochdale abuse victims, has been kept off the final list in what will be seen as a bid to ease Ms O’Reilly’s selection. However, it is understood that a strong council leader candidate from Essex remains in the frame.

The October 9 by-election was caused by the sudden death last weekend of long-serving Labour MP Jim Dobbin, who at the 2010 Election had a majority of almost 6,000 over the Tories, with Ukip trailing in fifth.

But the anti-Brussels party, which came within 24 votes of winning a local council seat last May, is now expected to make a serious challenge in the seat to prove it can win votes in Labour’s Northern heartland just as much as it can in the Tory shires.

Ms O’Reilly, 57, who already serves on Harriet Harman’s commission investigating discrimination against older women, was not available for comment yesterday. But the Irish-born presenter made her leanings clear last year when she tried to become Labour candidate for Nuneaton.

Last night, a well-placed party insider said: ‘The final choice will be up to local members in Heywood and Middleton. But there’s no doubt Miriam would be a great candidate. After all, she took on the BBC on age discrimination and won.’

Ms O’Reilly took the Corporation to an employment tribunal three years ago, after she was one of four female presenters in their 40s and 50s dropped from the popular rural affairs show.

The tribunal found in her favour, ruling that she had been ‘dismissed almost entirely out of hand’ in a landmark judgment that caused the Corporation severe embarrassment. Ms O’Reilly later left the BBC.

Last night, friends said that although she had no direct links to Heywood and Middleton, she had worked in Manchester as well as presented BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour when it dealt with child abuse stories.

A spokeswoman for Ms Harman insisted she was not involved in the selection battle. But one Labour MP commented: ‘Here we go again – party bosses quietly trying to make sure their favoured candidates get through.’
