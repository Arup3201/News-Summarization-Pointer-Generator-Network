Sheryl Sandberg now has even more reason to keep leaning in after a record Facebook closing stock price took the 44-year-old's fortune past the billion dollar mark.

The Menlo Park, California-based company's stock surged Tuesday before closing at $58.51. As COO, Sandberg owns 12.3 million shares, 4.7 million stock options as well as other stock awards.

Thanks to her investment prowess, shrewd business sense and with the help of her million-selling book Lean In, Sandberg is now part of a rarefied club of billionaire women across the globe.

Billionaire: Sheryl Sandberg officially became a billionaire on Tuesday when shares of the social media company hit a record $58.51

Sandberg's stock shares alone were worth about $720 million as the market closed Tuesday.

According to Forbes, there were just 138 total billionaires on Earth last year among 1,426 all told.

Even among the world's richest women, Sandberg's achievement is a rare one. Only 24 of the billionaire women on the Forbes list are self-made.

Her age is also significant. At 44, she can now count herself among the world's youngest female billionaires.

In addition to the $300 million in Facebook stock Bloomberg reports she's sold since the company's initial public offering in May 2012, she was that year's highest paid woman with earnings of $26.2 million.

Accomplished author: While her Facebook stock was enough to put her over the billion dollar mark on Tuesday, she'd already given herself a healthy nudge since publishing the best-selling Lean In last year

She became a feminist darling last year with the publication of her book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, the million or so of which she sold could hardly have hurt her on the road to a billion.

Though Sandberg clearly works hard and has children to raise with husband David Goldberg, she still finds time to splurge on the finer things in life.

In August, MailOnline exclusively revealed the newly minted billionaire's new $11 million Silicon Valley home.

Her 9,210 square foot home features a living roof similar to the one planned for the social media giant's new building. Solar panels adorn the roof - which has a grass area- and much of the building is hidden underground in a huge basement.

Designed by San Francisco firm Dumican Mosey Architects, the basement houses a wine room, gym, movie theater, office and guest bedroom.

The exterior is cramped into space but a basketball court and hoop sits alongside the structure, presumably for her two young children, a boy, seven and girl, five.

Sadly, the lot doesn't seem to have enough space for a pool to have been dug.

The house also boasts a giant waterfall and a large room ‘great room’ where Sandberg can host her legendary dinner parties for Silicon Valley’s elite.

Complete with sparkling lights spelling out the house number, the property has several parking places and a large garage at the front.

Bedrooms on the second floor have large windows which face onto the leafy road that is one of Menlo Park’s most exclusive addresses.

The rear of the house is hidden by large fences, so only the wood, concrete and glass facade is visible from the road, shielding the family from prying eyes.

Moved on: Sandberg moved from this rather more traditional home in nearby super-wealthy Atherton, California
