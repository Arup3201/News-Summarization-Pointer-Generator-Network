Wales manager Chris Coleman has joked he will ignore any envelopes with Madrid postmarks until after Gareth Bale has played against Andorra.

Angel Di Maria claimed Real sent him a letter on the morning of Argentina’s World Cup final asking him not to feature for fear of aggravating a thigh injury.

The Spanish giants are understood to have had concerns about Bale playing on Andorra’s new artificial 3G pitch for their Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday night but Coleman insists the club have been a pleasure to deal with.

Joke: Coleman joked about Di Maria's revelation that Real Madrid asked him not to play in World Cup final

He met Carlo Ancelotti during a trip to watch Bale play against Cordoba in Real’s La Liga opener and will start the 25-year-old, despite their only being four days before the Madrid derby against Atletico.

‘I’ve not had a letter and if there is I'll open it on Wednesday morning,’ Coleman said with a smile. ‘I went there two weeks ago, we had a great welcome. Carlo Ancelotti is magnificent, a fantastic guy, whose achieved special things and shows how to behave. Really accommodating.

‘The medical team there are brilliant, we spoke to them about Gareth and they were great with us. We've never had any obstacles from them.’

Coleman believes Bale, a Champions League winner in his first season at Real, now wants glory with his country and can set an example for others to follow.

‘He's just won the Champions League which is seen as the pinnacle. He's got a taste for that success.

‘It's good for the other lads because they'll talk to him about the Champions League final and what it was like.

‘Gareth will want to play against the best teams and the big games and that is tournament football. To get there (to Euro 2016) we need to take care of business and he'll be a good influence on that.

With the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Ashley Williams, and Joe Allen also in the team, Wales have the best chance to make a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup.

Coleman added: ‘I've said it to them when they get labelled the golden generation, think about the teams that have come before you and not done it.

‘Southall, Saunders, Hughes, Rush, Giggs, Speed, more, all in the same team – but they couldn't do it. We have to step up, we know that.

‘It's the first time in two years where we're going into a game with expectation to go on and win. Other games are either 50-50 or we're underdogs. So this is a new experience.’
