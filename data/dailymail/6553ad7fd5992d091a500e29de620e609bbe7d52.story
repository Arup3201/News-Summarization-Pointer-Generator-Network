A tiny B&B in the Outer Hebrides has won a landmark legal victory against holiday review website TripAdvisor.

Richard Gollin, 64, launched a small claims action at Stornoway Sheriff Court over what he says are ‘false and malicious’ criticisms of his guesthouse in Lewis, which the site refused to take down after being posted by its users.

He maintained the website lost him valuable bookings of around £2,000 by refusing to remove the 'untrue' comments.

Richard Gollin claimed that negative comments posted about his guesthouse are false and should have been removed by Tripadvisor

Criticised: The guesthouse at the centre of the legal dispute

Until now, TripAdvisor, which is 
based in the U.S. and worth around $4billion, has denied it was
 subject to UK laws and could therefore not be sued.

It previously challenged the 
jurisdiction of the Scottish court claiming the firm is outside the 
remit of the Scottish legal system because it is based in Massachusetts.

However,
 Mr Gollin’s lawyer, Duncan Burd, a solicitor who is more used to 
crofting cases, won a concession from the firm which has agreed it can 
be sued in Scotland.

The floodgates could be opened to people suing global website travel guide TripAdvisor after the significant victory won by a tiny B&B

But it was a bittersweet victory for Mr Gollin as Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie ruled in TripAdvisor’s favour over transferring the action to a higher court, which requires him to hire a lawyer and be exposed to unlimited expenses.

An appeal is being lodged and is expected to be heard in Stornoway in two months.

If it goes ahead, the case will now pivot on the legal interpretation of TripAdvisor’s website terms and under the basis of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

The floodgates for legal action against the site could now open, because the decision could be cited in cases outside Scotland.
