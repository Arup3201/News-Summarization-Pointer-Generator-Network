Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was left smiling at the end of a difficult weekend by watching the club's new Major League Soccer franchise make a sparkling start to life at Yankee Stadium.

The sight of Manuel Pellegrini's men crashing at Burnley on Saturday wouldn't have been easy for Al Mubarak to stomach as hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League title receded.

But he was sporting the broadest of smiles after David Villa inspired NYCFC to see off the New England Revolution and ensure a perfect beginning to their temporary stint in the Bronx.

The Etihad supremo, along with chief executive Ferran Soriano, did the rounds in the locker room after the match and spoke to members of Jason Kreis' squad, thanking them for their efforts.

Al Mubarak told Sportsmail: 'I was really pleased how the team played. It was great to see.

'The first game is always going to be tricky. We were at home, New England had got the to the final last season but it was a great performance.

'I was particularly pleased with the second half. The crowd were great.'

Spanish superstar Villa was the hero, scoring one and making another for former Revs midfielder Patrick Mullins at the death to seal the triumph in front of a crowd which exceeded 43,000.

'It's very simple. We have a very special player named David Villa,' Mullins said. 'We make good runs and he's going to find us. If we put it away, we're going to score a lot of goals this year.'
