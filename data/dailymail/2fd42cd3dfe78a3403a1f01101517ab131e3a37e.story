FIFTY firefighters have been battling a huge inferno throughout the night that broke out at a recycling plant in Stockport near the M60 motorway.

Flames and plumes of smoke could be seen pouring out of Bredbury Recycling Plant on Bredbury Industrial Estate shortly after 9pm yesterday.

Five fire engines and an aerial appliance were initially sent to the scene in Stockport Road West. But such was the severity of the blaze, they were joined by a further five a short time later.

Earlier today, officer in charge Sean Booth said: 'We will certainly be here for longer than today.

'There is a large smoke plume going into the air and moving towards Tameside. The smoke plume is not affecting the motorway but please take care when in the area.'

'We were faced by a rapidly developing fire at a site of about 100m by 100m when we arrived after 9pm last night and have been working at the scene all night.

'Because of the efforts overnight, we were able to contain the fire and have been able to lift some of the road closures and restrictions that were put in place.'

At the time of writing, all fifty firefighters remained at the scene. Many of the businesses in the area have been able to open.
