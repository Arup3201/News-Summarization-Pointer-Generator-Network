Snapchat started showing adverts last October in a bid to finally make a profit from its hugely popular ephemeral app.

And now a report has revealed just how much it is charging advertising firms to reach the app’s 100 million users.

‘Multiple industry sources’ claim Snapchat demands a staggering $750,000 (£493,000) minimum -despite the fact the ads self-destruct like its messages at the end of each day.

Snapchat started showing ads on its Recent Updates page (pictured) last October in a bid to finally make a profit from the hugely popular ephemeral app, and now a report has revealed that it demands  staggering $750,000 (£493,000) minimum - despite the fact the ads self-destruct like its messages at the end of each day

The figures were reported in AdWeek on Wednesday, and one source in particular is quoted as saying: '[Snapchat] has minimums, and they are very firm on them. 

'From a monetisation perspective, they are looking for fewer, bigger, better.’

To put this into perspective, an advert during American Idol costs approximately $475,000 (£313,185), while a 30-second slot during the Superbowl costs in the region of $4 million (£2.6 million).

YouTube charges $500,000 (£329,760) a day for a masthead.

Instagram runs similar Sponsored Posts to Snapchat, with prices ranging from around $350,000 (£230,830) up to $1 million (£659,000) - but that is said to be for a month-long contract.

Twitter is said to charge per click, known as engagement, at around $2 (£1.30), but Promoted Trends are quoted in the region of $200,000 (£131,880). 

Facebook advertising varies widely based on the audience, budget, how long the adverts will run and if the firm wants to pay per click - but prices start as low as $1 (66p).

Advertisers have typically struggled to be accessible to teens.

Snapchat’s demographic is younger than its social media rivals - predominantly Twitter and Facebook - and this route of advertising essentially provides a direct link to teenagers globally. 

The app does has limited reporting capabilities, however, due to its ephemeral nature, so advertisers will be given limited demographic feedback about ad reach.

Snapchat’s first adverts appeared in October, but only on the app’s ‘Recent Updates’ page in the US.

The firm said at the time that it won’t put adverts in user’s personal communications, such as Snaps or Chats, because ‘that would be totally rude.’

It added: ‘Understandably, a lot of folks want to know why we’re introducing advertisements to our service.

‘The answer is probably unsurprising - we need to make money.

‘Advertising allows us to support our service while delivering neat content to Snapchatters.

‘We promise that we’ll use the money we make to continue to surprise the Snapchat community with more terrific products.’

Universal Pictures was the app’s first ad partner for its film Ouija, and later ran a second ad for Dumb and Dumber To.

Other firms that have taken advertising on the app are McDonald’s, Samsung and Electronic Arts.

Snapchat are said to be staying firm on the price and MailOnline has contacted the firm for more comment.
