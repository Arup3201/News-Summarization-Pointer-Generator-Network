An inventive businessman with a keen interest in sailing has created a car roof container that transforms into a boat complete with oars.

Mark Tilley, 50, from Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, came up with the idea to create a car roof box, which can be flipped over to create a boat, while on holiday in France.

The box can hold up to 175kg of weight while attached to the top of the car, but the lid can also be easily detached and used as a boat.

The boat, which is capable of holding two adults, can also be fitted with an electric motor or a 2hp petrol engine.

Mr Tilley, managing director of Boatbox Ltd, said: 'When I was camping in Brittany I saw a British family arrive and unpack their tent, stove, sleeping bags and other equipment.

'They were just using a regular roof box and set up pitch right by the beach.

'For two weeks the roof box was redundant.

'But as a yacht surveyor I had the mad thought that it may be possible to design a roof box that could also be a boat.'

There are two models of the box - a 650 litre version and a 700 litre version - which both come with a set of oars, rowlocks, the necessary hinges and securing clasps.

Mr Tilley said: 'The response from the public has been incredible.

'It's a genuinely good product - no more expensive than a posh roof box on the high street and yet it is so much more.

'It is a really large roof box - just about the biggest available and it is also very strong.'
