The Bible says the the Sea of Gallilee is where Jesus Christ walked on water -- though the holy site will likely be the place respect for Congress sinks even lower after it was revealed that a freshman House member stripped naked and jumped into the water there during an official tour of Israel.

Kansas Rep Kevin Yoder, 36, who was voted one of 'Hottest Freshmen in Congress,' has apologised after getting into trouble for skinny dipping in the holy water in August 2011.

He was one of six Congressmen who jumped in the lake after a drunken night out at a high-price hotel, it emerged on Sunday.

Embarrassed: Rep Kevin Yoder, who is from a suburb of Kansas City, Kansas, apologized for skinny dipping during the trip to the Holy Land

Politico reports
 that the hard-partying in the Holy Land was so outrageous that it led 
the FBI to open an investigation and prompted embarrassed Republican 
party leaders to dress down the freshman lawmakers

Rep Yoder admitted disrobing in front of one Congressman's daughter and the wife of another member.

He and thirty freshman lawmakers had gone to Israel in August 2011 for an all-expense-paid trip, along with their families and aides, that cost a reported $10,000 per person.

The American Israel Educational Foundation paid for the trip, which is a rite of passage for new members of Congress. The group, closely tied to the powerful AIPAC, says it uses the visits to Israel to educate each new class of lawmakers about the importance of the the Jewish nation's relationship with the United States.

Republican leaders Reps Eric Candor 
and Kevin McCarthy -- the no. 2 and no. 3 ranking members of the House 
-- who escorted the first-year Congressmen, were reportedly furious and told the members that they were trivializing the mission of the junket to the Holy Land.

Rep Yoder admitted to the incident and said he was sorry in a statement to Politico, saying: 'It is my greatest honor to represent the people of Kansas in Congress and (for) any embarrassment I have caused for my colleagues and constituents, I apologize.'

Adding to the Kansas City Star he said: 'I feel incredibly remorseful that I have caused embarrassment to my constituents and I have caused folks who believe in me to be disappointed.

'The gravity of the situation and the actions I've taken are not lost on me, and I feel certainly regret at what has occurred, and I just want to apologize to my constituents for a momentary lapse in judgment.'

Sacred: The Sea of Galilee is where the Bible says Jesus Christ walked on water. It remains holy to Christians

But while he said sorry for the naked swim, Rep Yoder denied claims he was intoxicated, as he did in 2009 when he was cited for refusing
 to take a DUI breathalyzer test after being pulled over by a Kansas 
Highway Patrol trooper.

He said he had had wine with dinner but was not drunk.

According to Politico, the Congressional delegation was staying at the Scots Hotel in Tiberias along the Sea of Gallilee.

After dinner at the $1,000-a-night resort, several members and Congressional staffers stuck around and continued drinking.

At some point in the night, the group decided to take a swim in the nearby lake. Some of the participants waded in in their clothes -- others partially disrobed. Only Rep Yoder took all his clothes off, Politico says.

The other participants in the after-dark swim were: Rep Steve Southerland, of Florida, and his daughter; Rep Tom Reed, of New York, and his wife; Reps Ben Quayle, of Arizona, Jeff Denham, of California, and Michael Grimm, of New York.

Several aides also jumped in, Politico reports: Steve Stombres, Rep Cantor’s chief of staff; Tim Berry, Rep McCarthy’s chief of staff; Laena Fallon, Rep Cantor’s former communications director and Emily Murray, Rep McCarthy’s top health care aide.

During the trip, the Congressman met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Shimon Peres and the ambassadors between the two nations.
