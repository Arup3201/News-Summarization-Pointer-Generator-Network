A five-year-old girl has died just four days after she was diagnosed with flu as she battled a 107-degree fever.

Emersyn 'Emmy' Waddle, from Moore, Oklahoma, passed away on Wednesday evening, her family announced on a Facebook page,'Praying 4 Emmy'.

'It is with saddened and broken hearts that we lost our precious baby princess at 8:57 pm this evening,' they wrote. 'She will always be loved and adored by her friends and family. Emmy had an amazing life and we were blessed by the Lord to have the opportunity to share it with her.'

The little girl, the third of four siblings, was kept home from school on Friday after she started feeling ill and was diagnosed with strep throat and the flu on Saturday, according to a gofundme page.

By Saturday night, she had a fever of 107 and started having seizures, her father Dylan told KOCO.

She was rushed to hospital by ambulance and doctors learned that her brain was swollen.

In Facebook updates, her mother Leah said that Emmy's liver and kidneys were also struggling to function properly and, by Tuesday, she had slipped into a coma.

'She's a very sweet, gentle little girl that loves life,' her father had told KOCO. 'We're trying to cherish every single moment and remember as much about her as we can while we still have her.'

After she passed away, loved ones paid tribute to the beloved little girl.

'I believe you had a bow on your head within the first 30 minutes after you were born and tonight you had a bow bigger than Dallas when you left and you would not have had it any other way,' her aunt wrote on Facebook.

Emmy's death comes amid a flu outbreak and largely ineffective flu vaccines.

Already this season, 45 children have died from flu across the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the first week of the year, 19 children died.

More than 8,000 people have been hopitalized with the flu since the start of October, with the elderly the most affected, the CDC reported.

The central states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Texas, have reported the highest incidence of flu illnesses. 

Emmy's death also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three quarters of people who had the flu vaccine this year will get the virus anyway.

The percentage of effective injections - 23 per cent - is one of the worst performances since the government started tracking how well vaccines work in the 2004-2005 season. The effectiveness has ranged from 10 to 60 per cent effective.

Tragedy: Earlier this month, 15-year-old Kobi Pickett died at home in Houston, Texas on Sunday after passing out in the shower and crashing through the glass door while suffering from the flu

This year, the vaccine doesn't include the specific virus that is making most people sick. Experts had warned that the predominant flu virus, influenza A (H3N2), had changed genetically since the shot was made. 

Among the victims who had been vaccinated was 26-year-old Katy McQuestion, from Wisconsin, who passed away from the flu after developing sepsis that caused her to have a heart attack. Before her death, she had been suffering from the flu from three days.

Also recently, 15-year-old Kobi Pickett died at her Houston home on Sunday after fainting in the show and crashing through the glass door while suffering from flu. 

To date, 45 children have died from the flu this season and more than 8,000 across the country have been hospitalized with the virus since October 1, the CDC has said.

At the end of the year, the CDC confirmed for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 per cent of all deaths.

And now, in the midst of a worrisome flu season, health officials are pushing doctors to prescribe antiviral medicines more often.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week sent a new alert to doctors, advising prompt use of Tamiflu and other antivirals for hospitalized flu patients and those at higher risk for complications like pneumonia.

CDC officials say a nasty strain of flu is going around that is more dangerous to elderly people and very young children. What's more, officials think the flu vaccine doesn't work well against this particular virus. So 'it's more important than usual' that doctors treat certain patients with Tamiflu or other antiviral medications, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at a press conference Friday.

CDC research suggests doctors prescribe antivirals to one in five high-risk flu patients. CDC officials say the number should be higher.

When given promptly - within two days of the beginning of flu symptoms - they can shorten the amount of time someone is sick with the flu, a number of studies have found.

The drugs also can prevent patients from becoming sick enough to end up in a hospital intensive care unit - or worse, Frieden said.

'Antiviral flu medicines save lives,' he said.

The CDC sent an advisory to physicians last month, warning them this could be a potentially bad flu season and encouraging prompt treatment with antivirals. 

Officials said doctors should not wait for test results confirming the flu if they are dealing with an elderly patient, someone who is very sick from the flu, or someone with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes and heart disease.
