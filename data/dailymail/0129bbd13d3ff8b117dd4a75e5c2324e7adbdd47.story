Brighton have signed former Chelsea youth players Danny Pappoe and George Cole on one-year contracts.

The pair came through the academy at Chelsea, before leaving at the end of last season. They have initially joined Brighton's Under-21 side.

Pappoe, 20, made two professional appearances during a loan spell at Colchestor at the beginning of last season.

Done deal: As has George Cole, the duo join after leaving Chelsea at the end of last season

Whilst midfielder Cole, 19, is yet to make his senior bow.

The duo have been on trial with Brighton's U21 side this summer, appearing in a number of games on their tour in Spain.

It is not the first time that the Seagulls have picked up a player released from Chelsea's youth side. 

In 2010 they signed Liam Bridcutt after his departure from Stamford Bridge, who went on to make over 150 appearances for the club before being sold to Sunderland last January for a fee in the region of £3m.
