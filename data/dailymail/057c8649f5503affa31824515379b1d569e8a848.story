Mystery: Marvin Clark was believed to be 75 when he vanished in 1926 near Portland, Oregon

Experts could soon solve the mystery of a 75-year-old man who vanished on a trip to see his daughter in 1926 - making him America's second-oldest missing person case.

Marvin A Clark's fate was unknown until loggers stumbled upon a skeleton with a single shot to the skull next to a rusty revolver in the woods, 60 years after his death.

Experts now believe the skeleton belonged to Mr Clark, who vanished near Portland, Oregon, and have found three direct descendants with a DNA match.

But because the remains were so disintegrated, they need one final piece in the puzzle - another relative of Mr Clark's mother.

Incredibly Mr Clark is still listed as an active case on the National Missing Persons Database.

That makes his entry - describing him as more than 150 years old, 5ft 8in and walking with a cane - the second-oldest in the country.

The only older case is that of Elijah Cravens, an Oklahoma farmer who set off to a meeting on horseback in 1902 but never arrived.

Unlike the case of Mr Cravens, however, Mr Clark's disappearance was well-documented at the time.

He left the home he shared with his wife to visit his daughter Sidney McDougall, 10 miles away, but did not arrive.

His panicked daughter offered a $100 reward ($1,400 in today's money) and ran an appeal in the local newspaper, where he was described as well-known and well-liked.

The newspaper 
said he had been traced to a terminal in downtown Portland and police across the Pacific Northwest were put on the lookout for him.

But despite a wealth of information on Mr Clark, who had partial paralysis on the 
right side, a 'halting gait' and couldn't use his right arm, no trace of him was found.

Cold case: A photograph of Marvin Clark and an unidentified woman, possibly his wife. His is the second-oldest missing person case in the U.S., beaten only by an Oklahoma farmer who vanished on horseback in 1902

Appeal: A $100 reward was offered for information on Mr Clark's whereabouts. It is believed he may have taken his own life. Pictured are stories that ran in The Oregonian on November 3, 1926 (left) and November 11, 1926

That was until May 10, 1986. Loggers 
were clearing an isolated section of Portland when they discovered the remains of a
 mystery man who had been dead for at least half a century.

Near
 the skeleton, investigators found an 1888 nickel, a 1919 penny, a 
pocket watch, leather shoes, wire-rimmed glasses, a Fraternal Order of 
Eagles pocket knife and four tokens with the inscription D&P.

A 
historian told The Oregonian in 1986 that those where likely tavern 
tokens, which were awarded in card games and could be used to buy food 
or alcohol.

Police also
 found a corroded revolver, and an expended .32-caliber bullet. A single
 shot had entered the skull at the temple.

Medical examiners, who
 said it was the oldest case they ever had, ruled the unknown man's
 death a suicide and most people assumed the man's identity would not be found.

But a few days later, a woman called Dorothy Willoughby came forward and said it might be her grandfather, Mr Clark.

She said he had once been the town marshal for Linnton, a small area near the secluded ravine where the body was found.

Her hunch, however, was not enough to solve the disappearance and she died in 1991.

The case receded again for two decades until Dr Nici Vance, from the Oregon state medical examiner's office, found the file on the suicide and began investigating.

Using technology not available before, experts re-examined the remains and created a more detailed DNA profile.

With the help of volunteers, it was matched to three of Mr Clark's great-great-grandchildren, all from the paternal line.

The match was a weak one, however, partly because of the age and disintegration of the remains.

That means another descendant of his mother is needed to fully confirm the skeleton's identity.

The mystery deepens: Claims that remains found in the woods near Portland could have been those of Mr Clark were revealed in local newspaper The Oregonian on May 26, 1986. The skull was found with a bullet hole

Ms Vance said: 'There's an association there, but it's not strong at this point.

'They're looking for a maternal link, someone on his mother's side, and following that lineage to shore it up and make the statistics a little better.

'There might have been an item of jewelry
 that was found with that person that could trigger a memory of a family
 member.'

'We've got somebody that we're looking at right now, so hopefully pretty soon we will be able to determine if the remains that were found were actually Marvin's'

- Janet Franson, National Missing Persons Database

Janet Franson, a retired homicide detective who works for the missing persons database, revealed one maternal relative has already come forward as a result of this week's media coverage.

'We've got somebody that we're looking at right now,' she told MailOnline. 'So hopefully pretty soon we will be able to determine if the remains that were found were actually Marvin's.'

The missing people database is funded by the National Institute of Justice and consists of nearly 10,000 cases.

Among the other oldest cases are two-year-old Mary Moroney, who disappeared in 1930 in Chicago, and 22-year-old hiker Joseph Halpern, who vanished in the Rocky Mountain National Park in 1933.

There is one major stumbling block in the case of Mr Clark, however.

Reports on the skeleton from 1986 put the age of the deceased at between 35 and 55 - even though Mr Clark was 75 when he died.

That means even if more relatives are found, Mr Clark's fate could remain a mystery for many more years to come.
