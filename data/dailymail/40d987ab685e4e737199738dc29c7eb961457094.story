The property market in Sydney continues to amaze with a recent buyer forking out over $600,000 for a one bedroom apartment that was just a mere 38 square metres.

The one-bedder, one bathroom abode in Potts Point, inside the Gemini building, equip with killer views of the Harbour, fetched $54,000 above its reserve, selling for $684,000 at auction on the weekend.

The sale of 39/40 Victoria street even surprised the real estate agent who sold the property, McGrath agent Richard Bonouvrie saying it was a record for a one bedroom in the building.

'At auction there were five bidders but I definitely think it sold for that much because of the view,' he said.

The Potts Point apartment had stunning views of the Harbour and bridge. It sold for $684,000 at auction

39/40 Victoria street Potts Point may have had great views but it wasn't very big at only 38 square metres (pictured) which is about $18,000 per square metre

'Also the amount of sunlight coming in, the position (of the apartment), it was quiet desirable.'

'The view is amazing and it makes all the difference.'

At that price it represents $18,000 a square metre for the 38 square metre apartment.  

It's history is that it was last traded in 2007 at $405,000 (a 68% gain over seven years) when bought by the property developer Peter Gaunt and his partner, vet Dr Kevin Foster. 

'Peter lived in it for a few years and then moved to Melbourne and rented it out. It then became vacant and he tried to sell it,' said Mr Bonouvrie.

'He rented it at $600 then tried to lease it higher but couldn't find anyone to rent and then decided to sell it.' 

'The rental market is a bit slow in the inner city market.' 

Laura Bitar who was also the other agent on the property, said,'he did try to lease the apartment for 600 per week... And we would expect the apartment to lease for somewhere between $550 and $600 on the current market.'

The apartment had an open lounge and dining (pictured) and was sold for $54,000 over the reserve

The one bedroom apartment reached a record sale price for the Gemini Building that it was situated in, selling at auction for $684,000. The perks are a rooftop terrace with a pool (pictured)

It was a one bedroom, one bedroom apartment. It had a master double bedroom with an ensuite (pictured)

Ms Bitar said the price guide was above $580,000 for 39/40 Victoria street.

'The Gemini Building was designed by Harry Seidler, a well known Sydney architect who designed many of our landmark residential and commercial buildings. The building was built in the 1970's,' she said.

'There were 58 apartments in the block.' 

It's selling point was stated as 'capturing breath taking views and stylishly finished for modern living'.

Before being sold, McGrath real estate said on realestate.com.au, that 'this inviting apartment defines ultra convenient, low maintenance living'.

'Privately and quietly set at the exclusive north end of Victoria street, it is just a stroll to the city.'

It's believed the stunning views (pictured) is what got this apartment $684,000

The apartment was very modern with all the comforts but was only 38 square metres

The apartment includes a double master bedroom with built-ins and a luxury ensuite, combined lounge and dining area open to the view, Caesar stone kitchen with electric appliances, security intercom.

And residents there will even have access to a rooftop terrace with pool and barbeque area, although one thing missing is a car space, but it's description does says there is ample scramble parking.

The building's highest prior sale was $560,000 which was put up for rent at $590 a week before being lowered.
