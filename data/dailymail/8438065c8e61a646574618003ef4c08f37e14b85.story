Members of Alpha Epsilon Pi in Atlanta woke up the Sunday morning after Yom Kippur to discover the outside of their chapter house had been defaced by swastika graffiti.

According to Business Insider, a photo appeared on social media showing the international Jewish fraternity's house at Emory University with two swastikas painted on the front.

Emory police are investigating the graffiti and have stepped up patrols around the fraternity house, according to a statement released by Emory president James Wagner.  

Defaced: Dr Hugh Flax shared the photo on Twitter, saying it had been sent to him by a frat brother whose sons knew members of the fraternity. The individual in the photo is a member of the chapter house.

'It is an offense against a Jewish fraternity and the Jewish members of our community, and it is a repugnant, flagrant emblem of anti-Semitism,' Wagner said in a statement.

'Among the many pernicious things the swastika symbolizes, in the last century it represented the most egregious and determined undermining of intellectual freedom and truth-seeking,' Wagner added.

In a statement released by the Emory chapter of AEPi, the fraternity said it is working with the university to 'ensure that intolerable acts of hate, such as this, will never occur again.' 

The photo was shared on Twitter by Dr Hugh Flax, who calls Emory his 'alma mater' and says the photo was sent to him by a frat brother whose sons know AEPi members 

Swastika graffiti was also discovered in September at the university library, according to the Emory Wheel, though police have not said the incidents are connected.

It is also not the first time that  AEPi has been targeted by vandals. In 2009, the Gainesville Sun reports that a chapter house at the University of Florida was painted with a swastika. 

Yom Kippur, considered to be the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith, ended on Saturday evening.
