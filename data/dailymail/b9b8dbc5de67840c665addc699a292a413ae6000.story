A survivor has been pulled from the rubble after four days as 900 people are still missing in Bangladesh's worst ever industrial accident.

Despite the arrests of two owners of the garment factory protestors are still fuming as they hunt for their missing family and friends.

Protests spread to a second city today with hundreds of people throwing stones and setting fire to vehicles after the collapse which has killed at least 324 people

Police also detained for questioning two engineers who were involved in approving the design of the eight-story building.

The wife of the building owner, who is on the run, was also detained in an attempt to force him to surrender.

Rescue workers continued to bring badly 
decomposed bodies out of the tangled mess of concrete, bricks and steel 
amid frenzied efforts to pull out remaining survivors, more than three 
days after the building came down in the worst tragedy to hit 
Bangladesh's garment industry.

Protestors light fires in the streets. Rescue workers continue to search the rubble for survivors and bodies. They said 'We are not thinking of wrapping up of our effort any time soon'

Rescurers work at the site of the building that collapsed last Wednesday. A huge section of an eight-story building that housed several garment factories splintered into a pile of concrete

Teams were going in from seven entry points gouged into the rubble.

Every once in a while a body would be brought out, covered in cloth and plastic, to a spot where ambulances were parked.

Workers
furiously sprayed air-fresheners on the bodies to cover the stench, 
leaving the air thick with the smell of death and cheap perfume.

The bodies were kept at the nearby Adharchandra High School grounds before being handed over to families.

Many people milled around at the school, waving photos of their missing loved ones.

'We will continue our operation for 
more survivors as long as it is required. We are not thinking of 
wrapping up of our effort any time soon,' he said.

Subrata Sarker, a fire service official, said he saw 12 survivors in one place, of whom three were pulled out.

'There
are many (survivors) still there,' Mr Sarker said, during a break. 
Around him, soldiers, police and medical workers in lab coats swirled 
around in frenzied activity.

Police
in riot gear formed a cordon around the site to keep away hundreds of 
protesters who have been venting their anger at the situation since 
Wednesday.

The protests have spread outside Savar, a Dhaka suburb where the collapse happened.

Police
fired rubber bullets, tear gas and used sticks to disperse several 
hundred stone-throwing garment workers in Savar, a police official said.

Military spokesman Shahinul Islam said 
324 bodies have been recovered and 2,419 survivors accounted for, 
including 19 who were pulled out today.

Clashes also erupted in other parts of 
Dhaka and in the south-eastern city of Chittagong where hundreds of 
garment workers took to the streets and vandalised vehicles.

Authorities
shut down garment factories in Dhaka for fear of violence, which has 
persisted over demands that police arrest the owners of the factories 
and the building.

Junior 
Home Minister Shamsul Haque Tuku said police had arrested Bazlusamad, 
managing director of New Wave Apparels Ltd, and Mahmudur Rahman Tapash, 
the company chairman.

He 
told reporters that police had also detained the wife of Mohammed Sohel 
Rana, the owner of the collapsed Rana Plaza building, for questioning.

The top three floors of the eight-story building were illegally constructed.

Authorities are still searching for Rana, a local politician, who hasn't been seen publicly since the building collapsed. Negligence cases have been filed against him.

Police in Bangladesh often detain relatives of missing suspects as a way to pressure them to surrender.

Dhaka police superintendent Habibur Rahman said Rana was a local leader of ruling Awami League's youth front.

His arrest, and that of the factory owners, was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the Awami League leader.

Police said they detained for questioning two engineers, Imtemam Hossain and Alam Ali, on Saturday.

They did not say what role they played in approving the design of the building but it was clear that the arrests amounted to a widening crackdown.

Protesters targeted Primark's London flagship store today to demand compensation for workers killed in Bangladesh.

The high street giant occupied a floor of the building and workers were suppliers to the brand.

A petition has now been launched calling for Primark and other retail brands which used the building to compensate the families of workers killed or injured.

Speaking outside Primark's Oxford Street store in central London, Murray Worthy, from campaign group War on Want, said: 'We're here to send a clear message to Primark that the 300 deaths in the Bangladesh building collapse were not an accident - they were entirely preventable deaths.

'If Primark had taken its responsibility to those workers seriously, no one need have died this week.'

Mr Worthy said there were reports of garment factory workers being told to return to work despite cracks being found in the building on Tuesday.

The campaign group are calling for a full inquiry into the collapse.

Campaigners also want Primark, with Matalan and Mango which used the building, to sign an agreement to end the 'appallingly unsafe factory conditions' in the country.

Mr Worthy said: 'Unfortunately we see things like this all too often. Just three months ago there was an enormous fire killing over 100 people so this isn't a one off.

'This is part of a pattern and it's a pattern that Primark needs to address.'
