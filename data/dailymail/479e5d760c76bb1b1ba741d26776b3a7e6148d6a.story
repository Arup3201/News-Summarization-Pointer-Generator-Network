They allegedly chartered a private jet from California to New York, bought hotel rooms in Times Square and went on a high-end shopping spree.

But Alexa Johzen Polar, 34, and Robin Antonella Pabello, 33, funded their high-life by stealing almost $300,000 from a law firm, authorities said.

The Newport Beach roommates allegedly stole a cheque for $19,500 and upped its value to more than $285,000 before putting it in a joint account.

They also allegedly got cashier cheques of $100,000 and $33,000 from the funds to put a deposit on a 11,000 sq ft, $3.7million house in Murietta.

‘These women were already deep in debt and wanted to enjoy life without any cares for a while,’ a police spokesman told the Los Angeles Times.

He added that Polar and Pabello wanted to ‘live like kings during the holidays’ by renting the 11,000 sq ft Murietta mansion.

In autumn the duo stole the $19,500 cheque to the law firm where Polar was a legal assistant, prosecutors told the Orange County Register.

After allegedly washing it out and upping its value to $285,000 they made it payable to Pabello and put it into their joint account at an ATM machine.

They also allegedly shopped at jewellery store Tiffany & Co as well as luxury watchmaker and writing equipment retailer Montblanc.

The theft was found when the issuing bank rejected a check processed by the receiving bank, prosecutors told the Orange County Register.

Polar and Pabello have been charged with forgery, grand theft and grand theft by embezzlement. They face more than six years in jail if convicted.

Prosecutors want the duo, who have pleaded not guilty, held on $285,000 bail each - if they can prove the cash comes from a legitimate source.
