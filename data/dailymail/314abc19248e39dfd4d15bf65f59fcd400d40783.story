Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero prepared for Argentina's Group F clash with Iran by playing a game of football tennis over a fence.

The Premier League strikers showed incredible skills and ball control as they passed the ball between one another before doing keepy-ups and passing it back again.

Aguero was on a raised path behind the fence while Messi was stood at the side of Argentina's training pitch.

Meanwhile, Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella has denied that he was upset with Messi's comments which seemed to question his tactics, saying there was 'nothing new' about what his forward said.

Messi reveled this week that he prefers playing in a more attacking formation to the one employed by Sabella against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Argentina's 2-1 victory.

'We don’t have any problem. It didn’t bother me at all,' Sabella said.

'The atmosphere in the group is perfect.'

With Messi revealing he prefers the 4-3-3 formation used by Sabella in most qualifying matches as opposed to the 5-3-2 fielded against Bosnia, the coach claims he asked his star player to speak to reporters and that his forward was not breaking ranks.

Dismissing speculation in Argentine media that Messi had demanded to speak publicly about the issue, Sabella said it was he who asked the Barcelona forward to talk to reporters.

Interestingly, the Argentina coach did revert back to 4-3-3 in the second half against Bosnia and says he will use that from the start when they face Iran. He holds no concern for how it will be viewed externally.

He said: 'If you’re not self-critical they say you are stubborn and if you are self-critical they say you are weak.

'I can’t think about the outside when I make decisions. I think about the group that I command.'

Argentina and Iran practised away from the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte on Friday due to concerns over the state of the pitch.
