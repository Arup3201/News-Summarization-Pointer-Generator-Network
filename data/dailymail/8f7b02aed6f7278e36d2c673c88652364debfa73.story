Ski champion Bode Miller's ex-lover - who gave birth to his child last month - has filed a police report against the Olympian's wife, claiming online attacks and threatening messages.

Model Sara McKenna's filing against professional volleyball player Morgan Beck, who married Miller in October, is the latest salvo in a months-long catfight between the two women.

McKenna claims that she was sent a series of online messages from Beck under different accounts that threatened her and insulted her with words like 'c***' and 'bitch.'

arrest and police involvement

Joy: Sara announced her pregnancy on Facebook and proudly revealed what he planned to call the child

Loss: Bode Miller, with wife and volleyball star Morgan Beck. The couple had a miscarriage in January

TMZ reported that the NYPD is taking McKenna's filing seriously, and is investigating.

Miller, 35, launched his fight for 
joint legal and physical custody of McKenna's child just days after Beck
 suffered a miscarriage. McKenna's baby was born last month.

The new claims comes months after Beck publicly branded McKenna a woman who lied about being on the Pill 'to lock down a man who doesn’t want to be with her.'

McKenna responds, 'No Morgan, not even the pill is 100% effective when you are having unprotected sex.'

She
told TMZ at the time: 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up 
my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.'

Shortly after McKenna became pregnant last year, Miller began a romance with Beck - and the two married just months later.

Beck announced that she was pregnant and
 expecting the couple's first child together around Christmas before 
revealing several weeks later that she had lost the child.

But already the storm between the two women was brewing.

Just weeks before the wedding, McKenna posted, ‘Go take your 
paternity test already Bode. I’m over the way you have been treating us.
 You can’t hide DNA in court documents.’

On
 the same day McKenna posted a message directed at 25-year-old Beck: 'If
 you make a fake Twitter to ask me questions about your new "fiance" at 
least be clever enough not to use your cat’s name #block.'

McKenna,
 who describes herself as a 'Firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S 
Marine, model and Ivy Leaguer,' claims that Miller wanted 
nothing to do with the child when she first became pregnant.

Now she has made it clear that she has no intention of surrendering any rights to the child’s father.

In
 a clear show of solidarity with her husband earlier this month Beck 
informed McKenna: 'You are stuck with BOTH of us for the rest of your 
life.'

Miller has also 
filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support 
payments for a child by another woman - Chanel Johnson.

Johnson,
 now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn 
Dacey.

According to Miller, the two are friends and he was involved in 
naming the little girl. 

Miller
 has won five Olympic medals – including a gold at the 2010 Vancouver 
Games, holds four World Championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an
 American men's record.

He 
recently announced his intention to sit this season out as he is 
recovering from knee surgery and determined to compete in the 2014 
Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Writing about his relationship with 
Johnson and their daughter in his personal journal on 
Universalsports.com on Friday, Miller insisted that he had never tried 
to keep the child a secret.

McKenna's tweets of her pregnancy progress -
 she has tweeted from the moment of the pregnancy test - must be 
particularly painful for Beck.

She posted the news of her miscarriage on Friday in this very public play-by-play.

The battle's impact on surrounding friendships is also clear.

In January, McKenna could be found lambasting a friend for a perceived betrayal.

Yet
 only a few months before, the women were excitedly exchanging details of
 the impending birth and telling the world how delighted they were to be
 friends.

In September @Tehren_Anaiis tweets, 'i 
am so honored to know such an amazing strong woman like 
@Sarah_A_McKenna can't wait to meet little bode babe!'

But only last month McKenna is accusing her friend of a 'back stab' by feeding information to Beck.

Reps for Miller and Morgan did not respond to TMZ's request for comment.
