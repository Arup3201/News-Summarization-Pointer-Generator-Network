Shrien Dewani has been sent to a psychiatric hospital until next month after a brief court South African appearance in which he was formally charged with murdering his wife during their honeymoon.

The 34-year-old was brought to Western Cape High Court in Cape Town in a police convoy this morning after he was extradited from Britain last night at the end of a long legal battle.

His wife Anni Dewani, 28, died when she was shot in the neck as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010.

Millionaire businessman Dewani is accused of paying three men to kill her during the couple's honeymoon, which he denies.

The 34-year-old was brought to Western Cape High Court in Cape Town in a police convoy this morning after he was extradited from Britain last night at the end of a long legal battle

Dressed in a dark suit he attended 
court for a short hearing this morning and will now be held at 
Valkenburg psychiatric hospital until his next appearance on May 12.

The
 South African government has agreed with the UK that if a trial has not
 started within 18 months, Dewani will be returned to Britain.

Following his court appearance his family released a statement saying Dewani was 'committed to proving innocence'.

'Shrien remains committed to proving his innocence in a court of law and uncovering the truth behind his wife’s murder.'

'The extradition process has resulted 
in a number of assurances being provided by the South African 
authorities in relation to his continued hospital treatment.

'We are grateful to the South African authorities for these assurances.

'Shrien's family and his legal team have every confidence in the South African judicial system.

proper place for its resolution to be the South African Courts.'

Dewani was flown out of Bristol Airport in a private jet last night.

Secure: The Valkenberg psychiatric hospital in Cape Town, where Shrien Dewani will be assessed to see if he is mentally fit to stand trial for allegedly organising the honeymoon murder of his wife Anni

A spokesman for the country's justice 
department said in a statement: 'Shrien Dewani has landed at Cape Town 
International Airport and was received by members of the SA Police 
Service.

'He arrived in the company of a medical doctor, nurse and members of Saps (South African Police Service) and Interpol.'

Anni Dewani died when she was shot in the neck as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010.

Dewani, a care home owner, is accused of paying three men to kill her, which he denies.

Scotland
 Yard said Dewani was taken from Fromeside Hospital in Bristol to the 
airport accompanied by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service 
Extradition Unit.

He was
 then taken on a private jet because South African authorities had 
concerns about his 'suicidal tendencies' and wanted to avoid media 
attention.

Spokesman 
for the Department of Justice Mthunzi Mhaga said: 'We took into account 
the fact that there was undisputed evidence during (the) extradition 
hearing that he had displayed suicidal tendencies and the South African 
government did not want to take chances.

Concern: His extradition comes as Mrs Dewani's brother, Anish Hindocha (pictured with Anni's uncle, Ashok Hindocha), has said there are 'so many different' questions to be answered over his sister's death

'His
 peculiar medical condition needed to be monitored and the situation on a
 commercial fight had the potential to compromise it and that would have
 (an) adverse effect on the pending medical examination in a bid to get 
him to recover.

The 
department said in a statement: 'There was a need to ensure him and the 
whole team are secured and that would have been difficult on a 
commercial flight with many passengers which had potential to compromise
 their security as his identity is now well known.'

Relatives
 of Mrs Dewani said during a London press conference yesterday that they
 'need justice', with her uncle, Ashok Hindocha, adding: 'From today and
 onwards this case will be about Anni. Until now it hasn't been about 
what really happened to her.

'The justice system is the way it is. Obviously we were extremely surprised that it took such a long time.

'There
 is one nation, one powerful nation called the United Kingdom, that has a
 treaty with South Africa. That treaty was challenged, so we are happy 
that it went through. Unfortunately it took a long time.'

Mrs
 Dewani's brother, Anish Hindocha, said: 'It's been very difficult. 
There is no life in our family any more, we struggle. With the help of 
the South African people, with the help of the British people, we are at
 least trying to cope.

'We need justice for Anni. That's the only thing in our minds, and we will hopefully get it soon.'

Three
 men have been convicted and jailed over Mrs Dewani's death, including 
taxi driver Zola Tongo, who was given 18 years after admitting his role 
in the killing.

Xolile 
Mngeni, who prosecutors claim was the hitman, was convicted of 
premeditated murder over the shooting, and another accomplice, 
Mziwamadoda Qwabe, pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year 
prison sentence.

Dewani's
 lawyers had argued that he should not be forced from the UK to face 
trial until he had recovered from mental health problems, including 
depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

But
 last month judges at the High Court rejected all his grounds for appeal
 against removal and denied him the chance to take the case to the 
Supreme Court.

They 
agreed with the South African authorities that if Dewani was not fit to 
stand trial within 18 months, he would be returned to the UK.

Ashok
 Hindocha said the protracted legal battle had been 'very heavy' for the
 family, who have not seen Dewani since his niece's funeral.

He added: 'At the beginning, we thought this was a very simple case. That was until Shrien became a suspect.

'Five
 people were in that car - four men and one woman. Three of the men are 
in jail, one girl was shot in the neck. One person hasn't answered the 
questions about what happened in the car.'

It is understood that if he is found fit to do so, Dewani could stand trial in September.
