NHS waiting lists will continue to grow for several months, the government admitted today after again missing targets for treatment.

The health service in England missed the target that 90 per cent of people should receive treatment within the 18-week period.

With more than 3million people now on waiting lists, Labour said it marked a return to 'that old Tory choice of suffering in silence or paying to go private'.

In June the NHS in England missed the target to treat 90% of patients within 18 weeks

Since April there have been 3million on the waiting lists, levels not seen since early 2008

Pressure in the NHS has been growing in recent months, and has seen a steady increase in the numbers on waiting lists.

In June, patients referred to hospital for operations or other treatment waited for an average of 9.4 weeks, up from 8.8 weeks in March.

It meant that 89.7 per cent of the 282,000 patients were treated within the 18-week window, missing the 90 per cent target.

Amazingly, 12,444 had been waiting for more than six months and 189 for more than a year.

Overall 521 people have been on waiting lists for a year or more, although this figure was 18,400 when the coalition was formed.

The government insists it does not want to pressure hospitals into meeting the targets, because it could mean people with complex health problems get pushed to the bottom of the waiting lists.

This week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced £250million for the NHS to clear a massive backlog of knee, cataract and hip replacement operations.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused David Cameron of breaking promises to keep waiting times down

But a Department of Health spokesman said: 'We know parts of the NHS are under pressure – that's why we've given the NHS support to do 100,000 extra operations this summer.

'By prioritising those who have waited the longest the NHS is likely to miss the target for a while but we expect it to get back on track later in the year.'

The total number of people on waiting lists has been higher than 3million since April, the highest figures seen since early 2008.

Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'The Prime Minister promised to keep NHS waiting times down but these figures show he has failed the test he set himself.

'There are more people on NHS waiting lists and those patients are waiting longer for treatment.

'Under David Cameron, people are seeing a return that old Tory choice of suffering in silence or paying to go private.'

But a Government spokesman said: 'We are carrying out 850,000 more operations every year than in 2010, eliminating the scandal we inherited from Labour of more than 18,000 people being forced to wait over a year for their operation. Now, only 574 patients do.

'We're investing £250million this summer to clear the backlog of patients who have waited more than 18 weeks - and despite having a million more people starting treatment every month, waiting times remain low and stable.'
