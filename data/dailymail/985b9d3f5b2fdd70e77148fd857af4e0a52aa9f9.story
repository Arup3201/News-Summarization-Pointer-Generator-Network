Grief-stricken: Rachel Uchitel hunted for news of her fiance Andy O'Grady days after the 9/11 attacks

Tiger Woods' former mistress has revealed that after her fiancé died on 9/11 that she married a man who she would not mind if he died.

The revelation comes after she said that her fiancé who was working in the World Trade Center when the planes hit was 'meant to die'.

As the nation prepares to mark the tenth anniversary of the terror atrocity, Rachel Uchitel, told the New York Post's Page Six magazine that dying on September 11 was part of Andy O'Grady's destiny.

She added that after the attacks she married a childhood friend who she did not love as much so that if he died she would not be devastated.

Miss Uchitel, 36, became the face of the nation's grief after she was pictured sobbing while clutching a photo of her missing fiancé.

But in 2009, her face was splashed across the American media for a different reason, as she was revealed to be one of the women associated with Tiger Woods' cheating scandal.

Now in an extensive interview with the Post marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks Miss Uchitel has revealed how she thinks she would make a good Ground Zero TV correspondent.

She also spoke for the first time about her middle school friendship with Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss her made headlines as the 17-year-old dating Jerry Seinfeld.

On the morning of the attacks Miss Uchitel said she refused to kiss her fiancé because she had just put lipstick on.

She said: 'I believe Andy was meant to die because he was too good,' she said. 'I'm almost happy it ended the way it did because I've learned so many lessons from him.

'It would have been tragic if we got into fights and then divorced. He lives on in my memory larger than life.

'I'm glad I didn't get to see any flaws that time brings on everyone.'

'I
would be a fat housewife with three kids living in Sands Point, Long 
Island, [if Andy had not died],' she told the New York Post.

In
2004, she married childhood friend Steven Ehrenkranz, who was a Wall 
Street trader, who she said she bonded with through shared trauma.

But she added: 'We both needed security in our lives,' of the marriage that only lasted 12 months.

'I picked as guy that I knew if something happened to him, I wouldn't be devastated.'

Speaking
of her childhood friend Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, she said they were 
best friends and were mean to everyone else until one day, Miss 
Lonstein Gruss held up a sign to her marked, 'RADS,' meaning ruin and 
destroy the s**t.

'I know 
it's ridiculous, but to this day, it still makes me want to cry and I 
still hate Shoshanna for doing it,' she told the New York Post.

Miss
Uchitel said she has not decided if she will visit Ground Zero on 
Sunday, but said she would make a great 9/11 TV reporter.

Moving on: Rachel Uchitel is now romantically linked to a much younger insurance underwriter Matt Hahn

'I've been asked to be a correspondent at [Ground Zero],' she told the New York Post.

'I
would love that. I'm the expert. Better [I be there] than some reporter
pretending they have a connection to it. I've had a voice for 10 
years.'

Miss Uchitel is now
planning a move from New York City to San Francisco with her much 
younger current boyfriend, 26-year-old insurance underwriter Matt Hahn, 
who she met on Facebook.
