A new anti-wrinkle cream, said to be so effective it has convinced women not to have cosmetic surgery, has gone on sale in the U.S. this month.

During tests, ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser Treatment was said to have reduced the signs of ageing in just seven days.

Avon, which is selling the cream for $40, says it contains an ingredient that boosts production of collagen and elastin, which give skin its youthful plumpness and elasticity.

Before: In trials for Avon's ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser Treatment, 69 women aged between 35 and 59 used the cream twice a day for 11 weeks

After: All participants claimed their wrinkles had been reduced, with some improvements noticeable in a week

As we age, production of these proteins  rapidly slows, leaving us to develop lines  and wrinkles.

Avon says A-F33, the cream's 'miracle' ingredient, steps in to stop this slowdown.

In tests, 69 women aged between 35 and 59 used the ANEW Clinical Pro Line Eraser Treatment cream twice a day for 11 weeks. All claimed their wrinkles had been reduced, with some improvements noticeable in a week.

Goodbye to Botox? Some testers were so delighted by the before (left) and after (right) results, they decided against cosmetic surgery after using it

Some even decided against cosmetic surgery after using it, the firm said.

Dermatologists
used a 3D imaging camera to look at the skin's response and claimed the
cream had thickened the epidermis – the outer layer of the skin.

Another test on skin cells suggested they expressed more collagen and elastin after being treated with the cream.

Cheryl Karcher, a New York dermatologist and Avon consultant, told Plastic Surgery Practice that the product would be an ideal alternative to Botox or similar injectables.

'It is something to add to our 
armamentarium of injectables, lasers and acids and all that we could do 
in the office,' she said, likening the Avon product to those on the 
professional market.

'It is more of more of an adjunct to what dermatologists and aesthetic doctors offer,' she added.

A-F33, which stands for Amino Fill 33, is a modified protein discovered by scientists in Princeton, and licensed to Avon.

Anthony 
Gonzalez from Avon’s research and development department said the 
ingredient had the power to change the way women look after their skin.

‘A-F33
is potentially as game changing in the fight against wrinkles as alpha 
hydroxyl acids (AHAs) and Retinol were in the 1990s,’ he said.

Fans include British actress Anna Friel, 36, who said she noticed ‘an immediate
difference to my skin which appeared smoother with a fabulous glow to 
it’.

The cream launched earlier this month, and is on sale on the Avon website or from the company’s famous Avon ladies.

This Friday sees the launch of the product in the UK, and thanks to buzz from the U.S., 60,000 are said to have already signed up for it on waiting lists.
