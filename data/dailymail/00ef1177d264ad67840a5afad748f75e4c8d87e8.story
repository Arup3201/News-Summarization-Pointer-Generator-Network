Rogue kitchen fitter Michael Tolliday promised a couple their dream £15,000 kitchen - only to turn their home into a bomb site

A couple suffered ten months of misery after a cowboy builder promised them a dream £15,000 kitchen - only to turn their home into a bomb site.

Michelle and John Lavelle employed Michael Tolliday to knock through two rooms into an open-plan kitchen at their house in Hartburn, Stockton.

The 44-year-old told the pair that the job would take him four weeks starting in May last year.

But by October little had been done and the couple had been without a kitchen, flooring or running water for nearly 15 weeks.

Tolliday was jailed for three-and-a-half years this week after conning customers out of tens of thousands of pounds.

The businessman who ran Kitchen Logic in Stockton, left victims without kitchens, water and electricity as he failed to deliver on his work promises.

Mrs Lavelle, 59, revealed that by the second week of October last year she had become so exasperated by the lack of progress that she confronted Tolliday, calling him 'a liar, a cheat, and a thief', and threatened to take legal action.

Roofing works that had been done were found by a building inspector to be wrong.

At the end of the month, and after another failure to deliver their new kitchen, the couple confronted Tolliday again in the car park of his business.

Mrs Lavelle said the businessman's reaction was to throw a 'hissy fit' and tell them 'he couldn't believe people were getting on his back'.

Following a total breakdown in communications with Tolliday the fed-up couple had to start from scratch and buy a whole new kitchen with a different firm.

Mrs Lavelle welcomed the kitchen fitter's jail term but said she and her husband did not expect to be reimbursed after the court case.

In light of his jail term he was not ordered to pay any of the £39,194 compensation applied for by the prosecution. 

Mrs Lavelle said: 'I'm glad he's been sent down but we knew he didn't have any money.

'We stupidly gave ours to him, nearly £15,000 in total and with nothing to show for it.

'We've got over that now and have a lovely new kitchen.

'But at the time it was awful, horrendous. We had no kitchen for about ten months and that was how we had to live.'

The damage to their home was so bad that Mr and Mrs Lavelle had to start the project from scratch and buy a whole new kitchen with a different firm

A total of 16 people were named as victims of the offences between October 2012 and November last year.

Teesside Crown Court heard that customers lost a total of £42,197.

Tolliday, of Peterlee, was jailed for 42 months after admitting 11 counts of fraud relating to jobs carried out in Stockton.

He also pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in an unfair commercial practice, but denied that he intentionally ripped people off.

The case was brought by Stockton Council after investigations by its trading standards department. Tolliday is facing civil court action through trading standards.
