His wife, Purnima, said Boro confessed that he was going to die for the public good, despite her begging him not to.

Speaking to the Indian Express, she said: 'This morning when he set out to participate in the rally, my husband told me that he will die today at any cost for the interest of the public.

'I told him not to go as who would look after our three children if he died. But my husband said he has to die in the greater interest of the people to get their land deeds.'

The state government of Assam had recently decided not to give land permits to people living in the hills around Guwahati

Boro's wife, Purnima, has now started legal action against two politicians claiming their actions led to his suicide
