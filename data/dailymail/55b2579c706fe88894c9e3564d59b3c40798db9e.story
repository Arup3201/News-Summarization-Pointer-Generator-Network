A celebrated architect whose estranged wife froze to death said yesterday he still did not know why she was left alone in a car after a drinking session.

Jonathan Falkingham, the chief executive of a multi-million pound property firm, spoke out after an inquest into his wife Nicole’s ‘avoidable’ death.

He said: ‘What we still cannot understand is how she came to be left outside in sub-zero temperatures for over 12 hours.’

Nicole Falkingham, 41, died from hypothermia and acute alcohol poisoning after a night out with friends in an upmarket wine bar.

Hypothermia: Nicole Falkingham was seeking a divorce from Jonathan Falkingham, the chief executive of a major property developer

She fell asleep in a car on a friend’s driveway in sub-zero temperatures and was found dead on the back seat the next morning, the inquest heard.

Her death came after she told friends she was fighting a divorce battle with her 51-year-old husband – the boss of Manchester-based development company Urban Splash.

Mr Falkingham met his wife when she began working as his personal assistant more than a decade ago.

They began dating in 2003 after he separated from his first wife and the couple bought an abandoned 17th century farmhouse which they transformed into a £1million home.

The pair were known as ‘property royalty’ and had a glamorous lifestyle. But Mrs Falkingham and her husband separated in June last year.

On the evening of January 24 Mrs Falkingham had gone out and had been drinking in a bar in Allerton, Liverpool, with four friends.

An employee at the Vinci wine bar said the group had drunk a ‘couple of bottles of wine’ when Mrs Falkingham changed dramatically and suddenly became ‘comatose’.

Bar staff alerted the emergency services but before they arrived she was picked up by  two friends, who gave her a lift  back to their home in nearby Otterspool.

She was found dead in the back of her friends’ black Vauxhall Insignia on the drive the following morning  after temperatures had fallen to -2C.

Police questioned the pair who had collected her from the bar that night on suspicion of manslaughter – but they were never charged.

The coroner said: 'It was a particularly cold and inclement night. Alcohol affects the body¿s ability to tolerate temperature'

The inquest heard Mrs Falkingham had been more than four times over the legal drink drive limit and had a blood toxicity level of 333 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.

Coroner Andre Rebello recorded a narrative verdict into her death. He said: ‘She had been placed into the vehicle where she remained overnight. It was a particularly cold and inclement night. Alcohol affects the body’s ability to tolerate temperature.’

But her estranged husband said the inquest had not managed to explain why his wife had been left out in sub-zero temperatures with only her quilted jacket to keep her warm.

After the verdict Mr Falkingham said: ‘We remain concerned that her tragic death was completely avoidable. But we, Nicole’s family, hope that we can now get on with the process of rebuilding our lives.

‘We would like to give our thanks to all those who have helped us throughout this difficult period.’
