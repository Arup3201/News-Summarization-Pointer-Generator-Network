Chris Eubank Jnr failed to show at a press conference to promote his fight with Billy Joe Saunders, provoking anger from his opponent.

The two bitter rivals are due to clash at the Excel Centre in London on November 29 but Eubank has repeatedly failed to show up at scheduled events.

And Saunders, who flew in from Marbella on Monday, was in no mood to disguise his fury.

'I think that the hard man of Brighton, who's brave when he's punching away behind his keyboard on Twitter, was exposed in front of the media today as a bottle job, when it came to meet me face-to-face,' he said.

'To think, I travelled from Marbella to London, getting up early to make the flight, doing my contracted promotional PR work, going to BT Sport, and then flying home, yet the Brighton Baby couldn't even attend without his dad holding his hand.

'He needs to man up, stop playing the hard gangster act, cut his baby reigns and be his own man. He's 25 years old and still mollycoddled by his dad and trainer, its like they still powder him with baby talc at night, pat him for wind and sing a lullaby for him, it's embarrassing for a grown man who's supposed to be a fighter.

Eubank Jnr has failed to show at three events to promote his fight with Saunders later this month

'I'm just playing with him, I'm not going to give him a slap at a press conference, why waste my time, if he's worried about that now he should be a lot more worried when I'll be punching him on November 29 in front of 20,000 fans, live on TV. I've no interest to do him now, I'll bide my time and get him in the ring.

'He's hiding behind his dad and lawyer and letting them do the fighting for him, I say come out and fight like a man.

'Once the cotton wool has been unwrapped from him and he's in that ring all alone, I'll set about him like a wolf to a new born baby dear, I'll rip him to shreds.'
