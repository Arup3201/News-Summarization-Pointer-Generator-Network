Novak Djokovic rallied from a set and a break down Tuesday to beat Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-7, 7-5, 6-0 in the fourth round of the Miami Open.

Dolgopolov led 4-1 in the second set before the world No 1 mounted a comeback to remain in contention for his fifth Key Biscayne title.

After the second set, Dolgopolov received treatment from a trainer, who bandaged the soles of both feet.

The Russian moved poorly after that and won only three of 27 points in the final set.

As Djokovic fell behind in the first set, he busted a racket in anger, drew jeers from the crowd and was cited for two code violations, which cost him a point penalty. 

However, he won a succession of long exchanges late in the second set that allowed him to even the match.
