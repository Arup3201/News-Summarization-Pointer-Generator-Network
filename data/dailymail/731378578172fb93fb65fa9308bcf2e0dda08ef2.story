The formbook shouted Derby runner-up Kingston Hill was the class act in the Ladbrokes St Leger and the 9-4 favourite proved it emphatically at Doncaster with a length and a quarter win.

Now trainer Roger Varian, winning his first Classic, has set his sights on the Prix De L'Arc De Triomphe in three week's time.

His colt's odds for the biggest race in Europe have been cut to 10-1 by Saturday's sponsors.

The Leger result was also a massive endorsement of the Epsom Derby form.

Runner-up was Epsom third Romsdal, who narrowly failed to give his trainer John Gosden a fifth Leger win.

Sir Michael Stoute's Snow Sky, hampered as the winner hung left in the closing stages – a manoeuvre which meant he had to survive a Stewards' Enquiry - was two lengths further back in third.

The build-up had been dominated by doubts over Kingston Hill running with concern quickening ground might force Varian to pull out his colt just as he had done for his two previous intended runs.

But Kingston Hill coped and also demonstrated reserves of stamina his pedigree questioned with a sweeping run which started at the back of the field over three furlongs out in the mile and three-quarter race.

Varian, 35, in his fourth season training, said: 'He looked a Classic horse at the start of the year and he has won Classic.

'I still think the ground is quicker than ideal for him but he has handled it. When he gets his conditions he will be an even better horse.

'He has not had a busy summer. Hopefully he has not finished yet this year. You would have to consider a crack at the Arc.'

Kingston Hill, who won the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster last year, is owned by Buckingham-based Paul Smith and named after a local hill the fitness-conscious owner regular cycles up.

He was joined in the winner's enclosure by father Derrick, whose colours are carried by Derby winner Australia and who helicoptered to Ireland to watch his colt in the Irish Champion after the presentations.

Saturday's win was also a first Classic for 23-year-old jockey Andrea Atzeni as well as being his 100th win of the year.

The rising star of the Weighing Room, later successful on Mount Logan, said: 'To win a Classic for him is amazing.'

Outsider Odeon was withdrawn after arriving at the start wearing an undeclared Hood.
