For those who happen to support Chesterfield, Ernie Moss needs no introduction. For those who don't, Moss was a giant of a centre-forward through the '70s and '80s, a prolific goalscorer and leader of the line with majestic aerial prowess.

He represented nine different clubs, making 749 Football League appearances, and many more as he played on in non-league, but it was at Chesterfield, his hometown club where he is a legend, and the record scorer with 191 goals in three spells at the club.

When the North Derbyshire club enjoyed their most glorious moments, he was usually around: for promotion in 1970 and 1985 and the Anglo-Scottish Cup win in 1981, when Chesterfield overcame Glasgow Rangers on the way to winning a rare if obscure trophy.

Pick's disease is a form of dementia. It is caused when certain nerve cells in the brain die and the pathway connectors change. It can lead to a change of personality and behaviour. 

Off the field he was gentle, articulate, friendly and genuinely popular; a hometown hero who opened a sports shop in the town when his professional playing career finally ended and he and went on to manage several clubs in non-League.

These days, at the age of 65, Moss still looks in the good shape - former Chesterfield goalkeeper Jim Brown insists he is 'the most naturally-fit player' he has ever encountered - and he still exercises regularly but his mind is not the same.

Moss suffers from Pick's Disease, a type of frontotemporal dementia caused by the destruction of nerve cells in the brain, which affects his memory and communication.

The first symptoms were noticed more than 10 years ago and he was diagnosed eight years ago, although his family did not make his illness public until last year. There is no cure and he has already survived the normal life expectancy.

Proof is difficult, but his family, friends and former team-mates are convinced this early onset of dementia is related to heading the ball as often as he did throughout a 20-year career of 749 games.

There are parallels to former West Bromwich Albion and England centre-forward Jeff Astle and other footballers from the same era who were powerful in the air and have suffered degenerative brain diseases.

Moss was certainly renowned for his heading ability, not only at Chesterfield but with all the teams he played for in the Football League: Peterborough, Mansfield, Port Vale, Lincoln, Doncaster, Stockport, Scarborough and Rochdale.

'Most will agree Ernie was not the best ball-player or dribbler but he was by far one of the best centre forwards around at that time,' said Brown, who became Chesterfield's commercial manager when his career ended and has been in the role for more than 30 years.

'He was a towering target-man, always dangerous in the air to the opposition at corners and free-kicks, very difficult to mark in the box, could always read the game well and had the knack of being in the right place at the right time, particularly in the penalty area which made him a good natural goalscorer.'

On Saturday, Chesterfield will host 'Ernie Moss Day' in his honour when they play Port Vale, in League One to raise awareness of the condition and funds for research charities.

Robbie Earle has lavished praise on Moss by calling the striker a 'great goalscorer'

Moss was voted Vale's Player of the Year in 1982 and Robbie Earle recalled how he helped shape his career as he emerged as a young player at Vale Park. 'He was a great goalscorer but when I played with him in the early '80s, he knew how to create chances for others,' said Earle.

Chesterfield will have items on sale at the Proact Stadium including limited-edition badges, a special edition of the match-day programme dedicated to his career and an ale brewed by the local Brampton Brewery called 'Ernie 8'.

Some of his former team-mates will be in attendance, along with Moss and his family, wife Jenny and daughters Sarah and Nikki.
