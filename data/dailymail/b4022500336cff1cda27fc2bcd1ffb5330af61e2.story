Mitt Romney last night stormed to a hat-trick of primary wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia, trouncing main rival Rick Santorum and all but securing the Republican nomination to face President Barack Obama in November.

It was one of his biggest nights in three months of voting in the roller-coaster Republican battle. Romney’s resounding victory, following a string of big-name endorsements in the past week, means that he can now firmly lock his sights on Obama.

With 98 delegates at stake, the former Massachusetts governor was on track to top 600 delegates, well over twice that of all his rivals combined.

Although Romney needs 1,144 for outright
victory, which he was unlikely to secure until June, his lead is now all
but unassailable.

In his victory speech in Milwaukee, Romney turned his fire on Obama, who earlier in the day had mentioned him by name publicly for the first time in recent months.

Returning the compliment, Romney used Obama’s name 16 times and Santorum’s not once.

Romney said: 'Under this President's watch, more Americans have lost their jobs than during any other period since the Depression. Millions have lost their homes, and a record number of Americans are living in poverty.

'And the most vulnerable have been hurt the most - over 30 per cent of single moms are struggling in poverty.

'New business start-ups are at the lowest level in 30 years, and our national debt is at a record high. And when you drive home tonight and stop at a gas station, just take a look at the prices and ask yourself, "Four more years?"'

Newt Gingrich has already cut back his staff and curtailed his campaigning while Ron Paul, the maverick Texas congressman, was intent on building his libertarian movement and not making a serious play to win primaries. Even Santorum has dampened down his anti-Romney rhetoric in recent days.

Romney lambasted 'Barack Obama’s government-centred society', as a place where 'government spending will always increase because…there’s no reason to stop it' and 'there’s always someone who is entitled to something more, and who will vote for anyone who will give them something more'.

With the next primaries taking place on April 24 in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island, Romney has three weeks in which Santorum, a former US Senator for Pennsylvania will be under fierce pressure to pull out.

Polls in Pennsylvania showed Romney closing the gap fast. Defeat in his home state for Santorum would be a devastating blow, not only ending his 2012 hopes but also damaging his future political prospects – a calculation that he may well be making in the coming days.

In Milwaukee, Romney was introduced by Congressman Paul Ryan, a rising Republican star and one of the big endorsements Romney received last week. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a top prospect to become Romney’s vice-presidential running mate.

Earlier in the day, Obama had begun general election hostilities by criticising Romney for embracing Ryan’s budget proposal and even mocking his probable general election opponent for his somewhat old-fashioned language.

'He said that he’s "very supportive" of this new budget,' Obama said of Romney in a Washington speech.

'And he even called it ''marvellous,'' which is a word you don’t often hear when it comes to describing a budget. It’s a word you don’t hear generally.'
