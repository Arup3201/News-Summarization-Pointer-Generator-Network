A teen girl was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday for maiming a classmate with hot oil in a fight sparked by a social media feud.

Myzell Armstrong, now 19, cried and pleaded for mercy in Cobb County, Georgia court but the judge ultimately decided on prison time and 20 years of probation due to the premeditated nature of the cruel attack. 

The fight, which happened exactly two years ago on Wednesday, was started in a row over comments exchanged between two groups of girls on Instagram who then decide to meet up in person to settle the dispute.

Prison bound: Myzell Armstrong, 19, was sentenced to four years in prison and 20 years of probation in court on Wednesday after she was convicted of throwing hot oil in a fight two years ago

Armstrong and her two cohorts allegedly decided to bring hot oil to fight, and boiled a pot of the substance before meeting the other trio in a parking lot of a Smyrna apartment complex.

Armstrong held open the enemy's car door while her friend, Zawadi Clark, threw the hot oil - maiming one girl so bad that she needed to get skin grafs for the second-degree burns that will leave her with a lifetime of scars.

'I couldn't scream I was just in shock like I didn't believe it was happening,' victim Ashley Hardy told WSBTV.

Mercy: Armstrong's mother Loraine also cried in court on Wednesday, as she begged the judge for a lighter sentence for her 'gullible' daughter 

But Armstong and her mother tried to convince a judge that she was sorry for the attack during the sentencing hearing, blaming her friends for leading her down the wrong track. 

'Again I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,' Armstrong said. 'I just want to say forgive me forgive me for being friends with girls I thought were my friends.'

Her mother, Loraine Armstrong, said her 'gullible' daughter had been taken advantage of by the two other girls involved in the oil attack.

Armstrong was the only one of the three girls to go to trial. Clark, the girl who actually tossed the oil, struck a plea deal for a lesser sentence.

However, the judge did not buy Armstrong's show of emotion and remarked that the sentencing hearing was the only time he had seen her show remorse for her crime. 

Explaining his decision, the judge said that he felt prison time was appropriate punishment for the crime, since it wasn't committed in a frenzy. 

The three girls thought up the idea to use oil, and had to wait for the liquid to boil before bringing it out and following through with the attack.  

'That's universally though of being the most horrific kind of injuries you can inflict on somebody,' the judge said.
