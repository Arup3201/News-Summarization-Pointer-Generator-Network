We all have those days when nothing seems to go right and it appears it's the same for the animal kingdom too. 

In this case, a raccoon was seen having a string of bad luck after it was chased up a tree only to fall into a pond of cold water. 

The  moment of misfortune occurred when the cute critter crept inside a lemur enclosure at the North Carolina Zoo.

The inhabitants did not take well to their unwelcome guest and it was forced to take refuge in a nearby tree. 

After waiting for the coast to clear, the stripy creature then attempted to get higher but ended up losing its grip on the way down. 

It was then captured plunging into a pond below before clambering out looking rather bedraggled. 

Bemused zoo visitors then watched the raccoon shiver on the sidelines as it attempted to dry off in the springtime sun.

Get out! A raccoon was chased away after it crept into a lemur enclosure at the North Carolina Zoo 

Swift move: In a bid to escape, the striped critter scampered up a tree and settled in a branch

Going, going... After waiting for the coast to clear, the stripy creature then attempted to get higher but ended up losing its grip on the way down

Unrecognizable: The raccoon was then captured plunging into a pond below before clambering out looking rather bedraggled
