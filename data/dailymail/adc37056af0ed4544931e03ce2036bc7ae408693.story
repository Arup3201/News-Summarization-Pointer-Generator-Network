The father whose 21-year-old daughter successfully sued him for $16,000 college tuition has opened up about the painful ordeal. 

Michael Ricci has not seen his daughter Caitlyn - except in court - since she fled to her grandparents' house in February 2013 in a dispute over her alleged underage drinking.  

On Tuesday, almost two years later, a New Jersey judge ruled in Caitlyn's favor, ordering Mr Ricci and his ex-wife Maura McGarvey to pay for her college tuition.

Today, in a diatribe against the New Jersey legal system and his own parents for fueling the ordeal, Mr Ricci has laid out his version of events.

Estranged: Michael Ricci said he cries nightly thinking about the public conflict with his daughter Caitlyn

'The entire thing makes me sick to my stomach,' Mr Ricci wrote in a first-person article for Yahoo Parenting.

'It makes my blood boil listening to a judge tell me that my daughter can go to any school in country she wants to, have no relationship with her parents, and we have to pay!'

He adds: 'Most nights before I fall asleep, I have tears in my eyes thinking about the difficulty my family is going through... It’s certainly not what I wanted for my family.' 

The dispute, he claims, started with an attempt to put in 'boundaries' for Caitlyn, who was kicked out of a Disney internship when she was caught underage drinking. 

'I understand that after she was kicked out of her Disney internship, a program she participated in to help prepare for college, she was upset and angry at the rules her mother and I set for her,' he explains.

'She was kicked out of the program for underage drinking, and so we had to set boundaries. That included chores, a curfew, and summer classes.'

Fleeing to Mr Ricci's parents' home, Caitlyn refused to come home and enrolled at Temple University - which her parents didn't know about until they read it on Twitter. 

But Mr Ricci insists his anger is not directed at Caitlyn, but at his parents - and says critical comments that have been made about his daughter are 'horrible'.

Defensive: Mr Ricci adds that the critical comments about his daughter are 'horrible' and he blames his parents for encouraging her to sue for tuition fee payments. He refuses to pay until she builds a relationship with him

He writes: 'Every day I wake up and miss my daughter. I miss talking to her, seeing her, asking her about her day, and being involved in her life.

'While I absolutely place blame on Caitlyn for this, the majority of it lies with her grandparents, who have fostered and even financed this debacle while she lives at their house. 

'What kind of people encourage their granddaughter to sue her own parents…their son?'

While Mr Ricci and Ms McGarvey agreed to pay $906 for Caitlyn's community college costs, they said they will not pay a single cent of the $16,000 until Caitlyn  tries to have a relationship with them.

After they previously refused to pay, Caitlyn sued them for contempt of court.

In his article, Mr Ricci condemned the legislation that orders divorced parents to pay for tuition but not married parents.  

After this week's hearing, he told ABC7: 'That's fine, they can hold me in contempt of court.

'They can do whatever they want. I'm not going to pay. I'm not going to give them any money until my daughter has a relationship with me and we start to heal our family.'

Hurt: Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci, pictured left, say their daughter only wants their money

Caitlyn left home in February 2013.

McGarvey told the court that her daughter left after refusing to do chores and follow a curfew, which they enforced after she repeatedly got in trouble for underage drinking.

But Caitlyn said she moved partly because of a dispute about taking a summer class.

McGarvey explained they had enforced the summer class as punishment for Caitlyn getting kicked out of the Disney College Program - paid for by her and her ex-husband - for underage drinking.

She moved in with her paternal grandparents in Cherry Hills, New Jersey and, despite their fallout, Maura said she tried to reach out to Caitlyn - sending her letters and writing her poems - but she never heard back. 

The parents claim she also purchased a car when she left the family home and subsequently demanded the money through her lawyers. 

Refusal: The parents, who divorced when Caitlyn was a toddler, said they will not pay until she attempts to have a relationship with them. She moved out of her mother's home nearly two years ago

Fallout: Caitlyn, a student at Temple University, says she left home after a dispute about summer classes, but her mother said they argued about chores and curfews set after Caitlyn was caught drinking

They eventually tried to file for an emancipation but the day before Mothers' Day last year, papers from Caitlyn's attorneys arrived at their home. 

The girl's grandparents - who have not spoken to their son in years - paid for her to get a lawyer to sue her parents.

She sued them for her county college tuition in Pennsylvania in August 2013, then in October, she sued them for the tuition money for Temple. A judge ruled in her favor.

'I love that child more than anything,' McGarvey, 42, said in court this week. 'But she only wants the money.' 

Her daughter countered: 'It's not about the money. I want to go to college.'

Caitlyn's mother fell pregnant with her while she was still at college and worked full time while also attending classes to care for her.

She divorced Michael Ricci in 1997 and they have both remarried and have younger children. But they have maintained a good relationship and regularly chipped in so that Caitlyn could get the best, Maura claimed in online posts.

McGarvey, an English teacher, and Michael Ricci, a high school basketball coach, have agreed to pay the county college tuition by January 1 but say they can't afford her out-of-state college tuition.

The couple say that their daughter, whom they have not spoken with in more than a year, did not apply for eligible loans and scholarships, but the student's attorney said she is has paid some of the $26,000 bill at Temple with financial aid.

The couple are raising funds for their appeal through a GoFundme account. 

Caitlyn Ricci's attorney told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the parents' combined household income was more than $272,000 a year.

'Caitlyn really is a good girl,' attorney Andrew Rochester said. 'She is the nicest, sweetest girl. All she wants is to go to college.'

The girl's grandfather said if his son and his ex-wife do not pay up, he believes they should go to jail.
