US President Barack Obama walks to 18th green as he plays golf at Mid-Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii, during his winter holiday in January

Barack Obama has reportedly already ‘checked out’ of his job even though there are more than two years left until he leaves office in January 2017.

The US President is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term – and has holed himself up in Washington where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day-to-day business of congressional politics.

He is already all but a lame duck due to deadlock on Capitol Hill and has been forced to use executive powers to enact reforms. But come the mid-term elections in November, he could lose power entirely if the Republicans take the Senate.

In the meantime, commentators claim he believes that his time in office is effectively over – and has begun enjoying himself.

US reports say he has been house hunting and has looked at a £2.5million mansion in Rancho Mirage, California – dubbed the ‘playground of the presidents’. 

Mr Obama was also recently due to appear on a late night talk show hosted by comedian Jimmy Kimmel, but cancelled after being savaged by the US media and Republicans.

They claim that he has not responded strongly enough to the downing of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 and needs to take a tougher line with Russia.

On the day of the crash Mr Obama attended two fundraisers in Manhattan and went golfing three days later. 

An analysis by the New York Post revealed that in the 628 days since re-election in 2012, Mr Obama has already matched the 81 days he spent playing golf in his entire first term.

He has also attended 75 political fund raisers as the New York Times claimed that he prefers to host public figures at the White House late into the night rather than engage with the minutiae of politics on Capitol Hill.

A report in the newspaper this month said that on a trip to Italy earlier this year, the US Ambassador in Rome had to scramble together a host of intellectual figures at the last minute to attend a dinner party requested by the president.

Last week the Los Angeles Times gave a potential glimpse into Mr Obama’s life post-presidency with a report which claimed he and First Lady Michelle Obama had bought a home in Rancho Mirage in the California desert.

The property is in a gated community where entertainers Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby once maintained estates.

The four-bedroom custom-built home also has a rock lagoon, two spas and 3.2 acres of land.

Mr Obama has long faced criticism that he has not dirtied his hands with the day-to-day business of Congressional politics and that this has contributed to the rancour on Capitol Hill which nearly brought about a government shutdown last year.

If the Republicans did take the Senate they would redouble their attempts to repeal his health care reform, the President’s signature piece of domestic legislation.

Mr Obama will leave office in January 2017 and will be replaced by the winner of the 2016 Presidential election, which could be Hillary Clinton if she runs as the Democrat candidate.
