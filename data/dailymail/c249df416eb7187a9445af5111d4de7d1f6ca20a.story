Millions of young children dreamed about being Ariel while watching the Disney film as a child, but few did much more than request the doll on their Christmas list.  

But for some, the appeal of a mermaid is clearly much stronger.  

The annual Merfest convention in Cary, North Carolina, saw over 300 men and women come together to celebrate being mermaids last month.

The annual Merfest in North Carolina sees hundreds of people come together to celebrate being 'merfolk'

Attendees took workshops on underwater modelling and how to hold their breath, and also swam with Hannah Fraser, a professional mermaid and environmental activist. 

The event is not for the fair-weather mermaid fan, with die-hard merfolk spending up to £2,500 ($4000) on their colourful tails, which can be made to feel as close to fish scales as possible.

Putting on a tail requires a lot of effort, so a lot of the merfolk have a mertender - a spouse or friend - to assist them in an out of their tails at poolside.

Not only do these mertenders help their own mermaid or merman, they often help the others around them, by using a lubricant like coconut oil.

As well as their tails, enthusiasts adorn themselves with wigs, tiaras and of course the classic shell bra

It is near impossible to put your own tail on so each mermaid has their own mertender, a person who assists them into their costume using lubricant and coconut oil 

Sean Norman, a mertender, says that the act of getting your scales on is anything but glamorous. 

He said: 'It's tricky getting some of these tails on. They're kind of grippy on the skin and it's an awkward situation.

'You can't look graceful getting into these things, so what I try to do is just help out a little bit and ease that moment of frustration so you can get to the fun part.'

The unusual event was all captured on camera by photographer Arthur Drooker, 60 from California, who took the pictures as part of his book Conventional Wisdom, which sees him travel around unconventional conventions around the US.

Merfest is a place for those with fully formed and fledgling mersonas, where they can foster this personality without fear of being judged by their own family

Arthur, who has been a keen photographer since he was 15, said: 'For a lot of them, the desire to be a mermaid was spawned in childhood after seeing a movie, reading a book, going to the beach or an aquarium.

'They embodied an idealised self: a beautiful, graceful and confident person.'

Arthur says that as well as dressing the part, the convention gives merfolk the freedom to take on their own mermaid character.

'To emulate a mermaid, one developed a mersona, akin to the personality of a mermaid or merman.'

He continued: 'Merfest is a place for those with fully formed and fledgling mersonas, where they can foster this personality without fear of being judged by their own family.'

This year's Merfest saw the first wedding - between Cookie Ramirez and her mertender, Ralph de Jesus.

Cookie, who describes herself as a 'mermaid through and through' - wore a shiny tail while Ralph donned a tuxedo T-shirt and black swim trunks.

Well-wishers splashed their tails to congratulate the happy couple as the ceremony came to an end.

The happy groom says that Cookie's mermaid persona has given her a new lease of life.  

Merfest sees a people empowered by their transformations

People's demeanors completely change once they put on their tail

'Ever since Cookie got involved with merfolk, I've seen a difference in her.

'I see her when she gets into the water, she just floats and you see the smile on her face and that's what brings me enjoyment.

'She totally changes when she puts on that tail.'

Arthur added that he had also noticed a change in Cookie's demeanor when she wore her special fins. 

He said: 'Like many merfolk, Cookie feels transformed when she puts on her tail.

'For her, being a mermaid is a position of freedom and creativity and it's broadened her perspective on life.

'There's empowerment in the transformation and everyone at Merfest feels nurtured by it.'
