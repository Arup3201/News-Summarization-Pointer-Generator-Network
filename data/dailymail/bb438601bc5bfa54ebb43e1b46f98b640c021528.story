'Embarrassment', 'occasionally' and 'necessary' have been named among the words Brits have most difficulty spelling.

Researchers, who carried out a study among 2,000 adults, found more than half frequently have issues spelling commonly-used words.

Others which we often struggle with are 'accommodate', 'questionnaire' and 'rhythm'.

 'Conscience' causes many a Brit a headache, and the words 'occurrence', 'restaurant' and 'guarantee' are also tricky to master.

Also on the top 50 everyday words Brits struggle with were the words 'definite', 'separate' and 'weird'.

While 'appearance', 'queue' and 'receive' cause many a person to scratch their head.

The results of the study emphasised the average person's reliance on spelling assistance - 40 per cent confessed they completely rely on autocorrect technology to monitor their spelling in day-to-day communication.

Over a fifth would panic if they were forced to abandon the use of autocorrect or spell-checking technology and rely on their own knowledge.

But spelling mistakes still prove common and costly- just under a quarter of people have been embarrassed by a spelling mistake they made at work.

While spelling ability is often noticed by others - 48 per cent of people admit they can't help but judge people if their spelling is bad.

A resounding nine in ten people think it's still absolutely crucial for a child to learn to spell properly.

Over a fifth of those polled said they haven't paid attention to spelling since they were at school - in fact Brits were most likely to just Google a word to find the correct spelling if they needed it.

And 40 per cent put their declining spelling down to the fact that they rarely write things out by hand anymore.

The research into Brits' spelling and use of words was commissioned by Nick Jr. UK to mark the launch of the new literacy-based show Wallykazam!

The show helps children learn to spell and develop their language skills through phonics.

Yesterday Tina McCann, Managing Director of Nick Jr. UK, said: 'Even accomplished spellers can have difficulty with certain words and many people will spot a few on the list that they find tricky.'
