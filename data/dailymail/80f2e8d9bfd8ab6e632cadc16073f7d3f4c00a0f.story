This the final photograph of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko, taken as he was dying in hospital shortly before he lost consciousness for the last time.

The public inquiry into his death heard today that Mr Litvinenko agreed to have pictures taken during his final days, so that the world could see how 'he was poisoned by the Kremlin'.

His friend Alex Goldfarb told the hearing that the image, which shows him gaunt and obviously gravely ill, was the last ever taken before he died from radiation poisoning at University College Hospital.

The inquiry was also told Mr Litvinenko had a 'feeling' that two Russian men were planning to murder him during the meeting in which he drank tea laced with plutonium.

Hospital: Mr Litvinenko had visibly deteriorated compared to this picture taken just a few days earlier

In an interview with police while he lay on his deathbed, the spy said that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun 'wanted to kill me'.

He met the two men at the Millennium Hotel in central London on November 1, 2006, and drank a few sips of tea which later turned out to be poisoned, the hearing was told.

Brent Hyatt, a now-retired Metropolitan Police officer, told the long-awaited public inquiry today that he interviewed Mr Litvinenko, 43, over three days in University College Hospital, where he died three weeks after the hotel meeting.

Mr Litvinenko said he drank tea from a silver teapot in the presence of Lugovoi, without Kovtun, but it was 'nearly cold' and he did not like the taste so only took three or four sips. 

Lugovoi then left the hotel with his family to watch a football match between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow match at the Emirates stadium in north London.

'When I left the hotel I was thinking there is something strange,' Mr Litvinenko told police. 'I had been feeling all the time I knew that they wanted to kill me.'

The Russian dissident, who was apparently working for MI6 after fleeing his home country, later described how he rapidly fell ill and worked out that he was a victim of poisoning.

'The vomiting didn't stop and I started having foam out my mouth and also bits of stomach with blood started coming out,' he told police. 'And I realised I had been poisoned.'

Mr Litvinenko was also asked about a meeting he had with an unidentified man at Waterstones Piccadilly branch on October 31 - the day before the suspected poisoning. 

It is now understood that man was 'Martin', an MI6 officer to whom Mr Litvinenko reported.

The Russian dissident, who fled to the UK in 2000 and claimed asylum before becoming a British citizen, drank hot chocolate and ate three pastries, while the man drank a coffee, the inquiry heard.

Mr Hyatt said that Mr Litvinenko's health had 'very clearly' deteriorated during the three days of police interviews. 

The inquiry also heard that Boris Berezovsky cut the amount of money he was paying to support the Litvinenko family after hearing that the spy was working for MI6. 

Family: Mr Litvinenko's son Anatoly and widow Marina outside the Royal Courts of Justice

Polonium is an ultra-rare radioactive element which was discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie in 1898, and named after Marie's home country of Poland, which was not then an independent state.

In the natural world it occurs as a part of uranium ore, and must be extracted through a laborious process in which many tonnes of ore may be needed to produce just a few milligrammes of polonium.

Even a tiny amount costs tens of millions of pounds to make - around the world, no more than 100g of polonium is produced each year.

The radiation emitted by polonium is in the form of alpha particles, meaning that handling the substance poses little danger because the particles cannot pass through human skin.

However, once polonium is ingested it spreads throughout the body causing acute radiation syndrome, which leads to severe illness and eventually death.

Alexander Litvinenko is the only person ever known to have been poisoned with polonium - he ingested the element's most common isotope, polonium-210, dissolved into a pot of tea.

Mr Goldfarb, a dissident who was close to both Mr Litvinenko and the billionaire tycoon he was once ordered to assassinate, said that Mr Berezovsky had paid $130,000 (£85,000) to bring the Litvinenkos to the UK.

He continued to fund Mr Litvinenko once he had settled in London, but halved the money he gave his friend when the MI6 connection became apparent, Mr Goldfarb said. 

He added that MI6 were 'not happy' about Mr Litvinenko's friendship with Mr Berezovsky, who was found dead at his Berkshire mansion two years ago in an apparent suicide.

Mr Goldfarb, a molecular biologist who became a political activist, claimed that he had been 'barred from entering the UK' after helping to expedite Mr Litvinenko's flight from Russia.

Yesterday Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina told the inquiry, which opened last week eight years after his death, that the last words she ever heard him say were 'I love you so much'.

She said that during Mr Litvinenko's illness his hair was so thin that when she stroked his head clumps were coming off in her hand.

The couple's son Anatoly, 20, also gave evidence, saying that he never believed his father would die despite his rapid illness.

Lugovoi and Kovtun have both refused to give evidence to the inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice, insisting they had no involvement in Mr Litvinenko's death.

The inquiry has previously been told that the spy was one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, and had allegedly been told that the Russian government was planning to murder him. 

The hearing continues.
