Survivors of the Costa Concordia tragedy have told an Italian court how they realised they were being sent ‘into a trap’, after officials ordered them to return to their cabins as the cruise liner sank.

As the first passengers to give evidence in the trial spoke today, Rosanna Abbinante from Bari said said she feared she ‘would die like a rat’ if she returned to her cabin.

The cruise ship floundered after hitting rocks off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, killing 32 people.

Survivors of the Costa Concordia tragedy have told the Italian trial of Francesco Schettino how they realised they were being sent 'nto a trap', after officials ordered them to return to their cabins as the cruise liner sank

Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial in Grosseto, Tuscany, accused of causing the shipwreck by carrying out an ill-judged ‘salute’ to the island of Giglio.

Mrs Abbinante, who was on the cruise with her husband, described scenes of mass panic and rage in the face of crew members who continued to insist that the accident was ‘merely a technical fault’.

She said ‘The passengers were beating their fists on the tables of the restaurants. ‘One father with a baby was screaming. They told us that it was just a technical fault but we understood that this was not the case.

‘I wanted to return to my cabin to get my clothes but the ship was tipping. I decided not to go- I feared I would die like a rat.’

Another passenger Ivana Codoni said that she ignored advice by officials to stay calm and return to her cabin.

Schettino is facing 20 year prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship

She told the court: ‘The personnel told us to go back to our cabins, but we realised that we were being sent into a trap.. and fled to the outer decks.’

Claudia Poliani, a hairdresser from Rome said that when the power failed after the collision, passengers were forced to take matters into their own hands, finding and putting on life jackets.

She said: ‘Suddenly everything changed, from the happiness and excitement of being on the cruise, we passengers were struck by panic. It was dark, we fell over, no one helped us. ‘ Unable to communicate with crew who spoke neither Italian or English she said, ‘we found life jackets by ourselves and tried to put them on.’

The survivors said that two years after the crash, they still suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.

Schettino is facing a 20 year prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship.

The Concordia was raised from its rocky seabed last September and is expected to finally be towed away from Giglio in the autumn, and dismantled for scrap.
