Juventus scouts will watch Sheffield United striker Diego de Girolamo play for Italy Under 20s on Wednesday.

The Chesterfield born forward is out of contract at the end of the season and Juventus are keen to recruit him for the summer.

The 19-year-old will play for Italy Under 20s against Qatar at Empoli's ground and other Serie A sides will also be represented.

De Girolamo, who is out of contract at Sheffield United this summer, has also been watched by Sunderland

De Girolamo qualifies for Italy through his father who hails from Naples.

He is currently on loan at League Two York City and was watched by Sunderland scouts at the weekend. 

Bournemouth have also expressed an interest. A move to Juventus would be a fairytale although Sheffield United would get less of a compensation fee should he move abroad.

Juventus have been alerted to his ability by Arrigo Sacchi. The former Italy and AC Milan coach was critical of Italian sides last week saying that they contain too many foreign players in their youth system.

Sheffield United would receive less compensation if De Girolamo moves to a team abroad this summer
