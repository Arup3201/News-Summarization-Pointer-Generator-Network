A builder who looted a collection of First World War medals from the home of an elderly woman as he carried out renovation work was today branded ‘the lowest of the low’ by his victim.

Gary Williams, 48, of Burnley, Lancashire, spotted the three medals through a bedroom window as he was fixing 65-year-old Jean Sanderson’s roof, then took them after asking to use the toilet.

He later sold the precious items at a local pawnbrokers shop. The victim’s grandfather was a military medic who had been awarded the medals 96 years ago for serving his country in the Middle East.

Shocking crime: Gary Williams (left) spotted the three medals awarded to war hero Thomas Henry Lord (right) through a bedroom window as he was fixing the roof of the war hero's granddaughter's home in Burnley

The Star, British War and Allied Victory medals awarded to war hero Thomas Henry Lord were returned when the shocked pawnbroker read a public appeal about the theft and tipped off police.

A solid silver flute was also stolen but not recovered. After Williams admitted burglary at Burnley Crown Court, grandmother-of-three Mrs Sanderson said: ‘What that man did was downright cruel.

‘I feel violated that he had been rummaging about - especially after I’d trusted him to do work. To think I paid him £400 and then he did this, it makes me sick. I have become quite cynical since this.

‘I would like to see him go to jail for what he has done. I want him to be punished but I fear he will get a slap on the wrist because of some personal problems he might have.’

The retired night care assistant added: ‘That won’t stop him from doing it again and that’s what bothers me, he could rob someone of a lot more. People like him are the lowest of the low.

‘I now don’t trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that’s not fair on the honest people.

‘It’s sad that we live in this sort of
 world. I’m sure my grandfather would have never have suspected this 
sort of callous betrayal back home when he was serving his country.’

Medic: Mr Lord (right) was dispatched to the Middle East where he helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead

Mr
 Lord, who fought during the Mesopotamian campaign against the former 
Ottoman Empire, is believed to have joined the military at the outbreak 
of the First World War in 1914.

He was dispatched to the Middle East where he helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead.

After the war he opened a fish and chip shop in Manchester with his late wife Margaret and died in 1940 aged in his 60s.

All of his medals were made of solid silver and had the surname ‘Lord’ and initials ‘TH’ engraved in the back of them - and had different coloured ribbons attached.

They were kept in Mrs Sanderson’s bedroom. The theft occurred between March and April after Williams turned up unannounced at Mrs Sanderson’s home and offered to do some building work.

She added: ‘He did some roof work for me and fixed a gate and the back and front door. I suppose he was like a Jack of all trades - but on his van it said he was a roofer.

‘He came to me and said he noticed my back gate was falling to bits and the roof needed work. He was cold calling. I had thought it was a Good Samaritan type thing, that kind of thing.

‘He obviously knew how to work it and I suppose I was a bit or perhaps a lot naive. I thought he was doing a good thing for me and working on and off for about six weeks.

‘On a couple of occasions he said he was going to the loo and I just didn’t realise at the time that the medals had gone and I was devastated when I found out they were missing.

‘These medals are very precious to me 
and were a vital link to the family past. Thinking about what may happen
 to them makes me feel sick - especially as they had been won by someone
 who fought for his country.

'What that man did was downright cruel. I feel violated that he had been rummaging about - especially after I’d trusted him to do work'

Jean Sanderson

‘There
 were very sentimental to me and (with the) D-Day commemorations, (I) 
feel sad that somebody would stoop so low as to steal war medals which 
had been won for great bravery.

‘When my grandparents were alive times were very different. People would not think of stealing from you - now it seems to be happening way too much.

‘When I got them back I was absolutely over the moon but I am very paranoid now about who comes into the house and I am always checking the locks.

‘I don’t like leaving the house now. I used to go shopping, I liked to browse but now I make a list and get back as fast as I can. It has shaken me up and I feel very wary of strangers.

Medals: Retired night care assistant Mrs Sanderson said she no longer trusts anyone to come to her house

‘I live by myself and it’s made me feel uncomfortable. I hate being cynical but that’s what it has driven me to. It’s made me uncomfortable that someone can do that.

‘The man who stole his medals betrayed all those men that served in the war and sacrificed their lives to allow us all to live as we do today. I think most people appreciate the sacrifices they made.

'People like him are the lowest of the low. I now don’t trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that’s not fair on the honest people. It’s sad that we live in this sort of world'

Jean Sanderson

‘Many like my grandson are really interested in what happened. I would dread to think what my grandfather would have thought, having served his country, for his medals to be stolen by a horrible thief decades later.’

Williams will be sentenced on November 14, after the hearing was adjourned for psychiatric reports. He was bailed on condition he does not contact Mrs Sanderson and must live at home and report to Burnley Police Station every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, between 12pm and 2pm.

Judge Mr Recorder Anthony McLoughlin told him: ‘While you are being granted bail, all sentencing options remain open when you are eventually sentenced for this matter.’
