A stalker who has terrorised a young woman for two years has been freed from court and allowed to live next door to her.

Darren Blee, 22, plagued Pippa Dowson by following her day and night, hiding in bushes and jumping out in front of cars she was in.

Blee, who lives with his parents, admitted an ‘unhealthy fixation’ with the 20 year-old and told police he could not stop himself from following her.

He pleaded guilty to stalking but was given a suspended sentence and left to return to his home in Truro, Cornwall.

Ms Dowson, who lives alone, said: ‘My life has been ruined for nearly two years and he got a slap on the wrist.

‘My safety is compromised. His feelings were taken into consideration over mine.‘It’s disgusting. I think it’s horrendous that they have just let him go home right next door to me.’

Garth Richardson, prosecuting at Truro Crown Court, said police first told Blee to stop his harassment in July 2012, followed by a caution in November.

He behaved himself for three months until February when he started following Ms Dowson again.

On one occasion she came home to find Blee screaming at her and making animal noises.

When asked by police why he kept following her, he said: ‘I don’t know why, there is something wrong with me but I don’t know what. I can’t stop myself.’

Dieter Kehler, defending, said Blee found it hard to make friends or interact with people.

New laws were introduced last November which recognised stalking as a specific crime with a potential sentence of up to five years.

'He threw things at my window at home. It’s been absolutely terrifying. From the beginning of this year it's been absolutely horrendous' - Ms Dowson

Blee was the first person in Cornwall to be dealt under the new legislation which Ms Dowson hoped would finally protect her.

He was remanded in custody by magistrates at the end of August when he pleaded guilty to stalking involving serious alarm or distress.

But he was freed when he returned to the crown court to be sentenced and got a nine-month prison term, suspended for 12 months, and an order to do 100 hours of unpaid work.

Blee was also given a restraining order not to contact his victim, go to her work or follow her for five years.

However, he was allowed to continue living with his parents in the house next door to Ms Dowson.After the hearing Ms Dowson told how her nightmare began in January 2012 when she was just 18 years old.

She had never had any previous contact with Blee before he targeted her out of the blue.

She said: ‘I noticed he was following me everywhere I went and it got to the stage where I could not leave the house by myself.

Verdict: Truro Crown Court gave Blee a suspended sentence and allowed him to return home, next door to his stalking victim

‘He threw things at my window at home. It’s been absolutely terrifying.’

Ms Dowson alerted police who spoke with Blee but that failed to stop him.

She added: ‘From the beginning of this year it’s been absolutely horrendous.

‘He was getting cockier and cockier. Twice he jumped out in front of a car I was travelling in which was terrifying. I started to think he was not going to stop.

‘It changed my life. I couldn’t do anything without being watched.’

Ms Dowson said she was determined to continue with her life as normally as possible despite the unwanted attentions of Blee.

She said: ‘The effect it had on me was life-changing. But if I’m not strong now, it’s going to go back to me being a complete mess again.

‘Hopefully, now other people are aware of what this man is capable of.’
