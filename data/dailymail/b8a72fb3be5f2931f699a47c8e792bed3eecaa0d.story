Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl suffering from cystic fibrosis whose parents launched a national campaign to get onto an adult organ donor list, has successfully undergone surgery and received a new set of lungs.

Her mother, Janet Ruddock Murnaghan posted on Facebook at around 8 p.m. Wednesday that her daughter was out of surgery and that doctors are 'very pleased with both her progress during the procedure and her prognosis for recovery.'

Sarah went into surgery at around 11 a.m. this morning, and her parents were briefed on her progress throughout the six hour procedure. Surgeons had no challenges resizing or transplanting the lungs.

Now out of surgery, Sarah is settling into an intensive care unit - the beginning of her recovery.

'We expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're going for possible,' Sarah's mother wrote on Facebook. 'And an organ donor has made this possible for her.'

Sarah and her family received news of the donation early on Wednesday.

'God is great! He moved the mountain! 
Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page Wednesday 
read. 'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the 
gift of life.'

The plight of the ailing child 
suffering from an end-stage lung disease has touched off a national 
debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children 
younger than 12 from the adult waiting list.

At around 11am Wednesday, Sarah's mother shared with her Facebook followers that her daughter will be heading to the operating room in 30 minutes after the family were notified that a set of lungs has become available for transplant, as CNN first reported.

'Please pray for Sarah and her surgical team and our whole family! We are overwhelmed with emotions!!!! Thank you to all of you for the unending support, ' she wrote. 'Today is the start of Sarah's new beginning and new life!'

On Wednesday afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29 about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child about a week to live, and they were out of options.

The mother went on to say that they got the news that a set of suitable lungs have become available at around 10.30pm Tuesday.

However, the Murnaghans waited until this morning to share the good news with their supporters and the media in case the surgery got canceled in the last minute, which had happened three times in the past.

'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one, and that they are grateful to them. 

Recalling her final moments before Sarah was wheeled into surgery, her mother said that she gave her a kiss but was unable to say tell her anything because the 10-year-old has been in a medically induced coma since Saturday.

'They intubated her, she's paralyzed, she's not breathing on her own, so I’m not sure how much she's understanding me,' the mother said. 

According to the girl's mother, it may take as long as eight hours before Sarah wakes up, and the fact that she had spent two days in a coma would likely make her recovery more difficult, but the family remain optimistic.

'We're getting new lungs, so she has a chance,' she said. 'She's a fighter.'

Last week, the Murnaghans scored a
 major victory when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult 
lungs.

The family's battle waged in the 
media and on social networks has inspired other parents of children in dire need of organ transplants to 
challenge the existing lung allocation process.

Javier Acosta, 11, who suffers from 
the same illness as Sarah, is now also awaiting a new set of lungs at 
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the little girl is currently 
undergoing surgery.

On Wednesday, Mrs Murnaghan said
 that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have
 gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager.

'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said.

The Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th U.S. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last Thursday.

The
 little girl, also remains on the priority list for a lung from a 
pediatric donor, Sebelius said. However, her family, through their 
official spokeswoman, said Sarah's condition had worsened.

Sarah's parents had challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available, or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered.

'We are beyond thrilled,' Janet Murnaghan told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'Obviously we still need a match.'

The ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds.

Lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center.

He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list.

'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said.

Sarah's family, who live Newtown Square in suburban Philadelphia, filed suit Wednesday. The Murnaghans say pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations.

Baylson suspended the age limit in the nation's transplant rules for 10 days for Sarah, who has been at the Philadelphia hospital for three months. A June 14 hearing on the request has been scheduled for a broader injunction.

Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

Sebelius had declined to become involved in the case earlier this week, despite urgent pleas from several Pennsylvania congressmen.

Sebelius said there were three other children at Children's Hospital alone in the same condition as Sarah. She has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies amid the higher death rates for pediatric patients, but the Murnaghans say Sarah doesn't have time for that.

Sarah's doctors, one of whom testified Wednesday at an emergency hearing before Baylson, believe they can perform a successful transplant on her with adult lungs.

'She definitely understands things have improved quite a bit,' the girl's aunt, Sharon Ruddock, said after the ruling.

The Murnaghans' attorney, Steve Harvey, said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy.

'I hope that they decide to discontinue it completely for children under 12. I won't be satisfied until Sarah Murnaghan receives a set of lungs,' he said. 'The risk of her dying until she gets those lungs is high.'

Joel Newman, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing that operates the nation's transplant network, said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy.

While many more adult lungs than children's lungs wind up being donated, the ruling doesn't guarantee Sarah a new set of lungs.

The matches are based on blood type, the risk of dying, the chance of surviving a transplant and other medical factors. The donor lungs would also have to be an appropriate size for her chest.

Newman said some lungs donated from deceased adults have been offered for children's transplants over the past two years, although he couldn't give a number.

But he said all were turned down by the children's surgeons.

The UNOS system was established to avoid bias in determining who gets organs, thus ensuring that the rich or celebrities, for example, don't have a better chance, Caplan noted.

He said it is transparent, with policies open to public comment and scrutiny before they're enacted.

'When a judge steps in and says, 'I don't like these rules, I think they're arbitrary,' they better be very arbitrary or he's undermining the authority of the whole system. Why wouldn't anybody sue?'
