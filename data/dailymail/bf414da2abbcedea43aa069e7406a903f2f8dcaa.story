It appears John Terry is taking his mind off the World Cup by enjoying himself on holiday in Greece.

The former England captain has uploaded pictures of himself and his family relaxing on a vacation to his Instagram account.

The Chelsea skipper is new to the social media platform with his club team-mate Marco van Ginkel encouraging others to follow the 33-year-old with his message: ‘Follow our captain. New on instagram! John Terry,’ on his own Instagram profile.

Terry's personal displays at Chelsea last season warranted some calls from the media for Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson to recall him for this summer's showpiece in Brazil.

The defender retired from international duty in September 2012 after winning 78 caps, shortly before he was found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand.

Despite appeals for his reinstatement Terry was omitted from Hodgson's World Cup squad, with the former Liverpool and Fulham boss choosing his club colleague Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four central defenders in the squad.

After their 2-1 opening Group D defeat to Italy, England face Uruguay on Thursday in Sao Paulo before taking on Costa Rica on June 24 in Belo Horizonte.
