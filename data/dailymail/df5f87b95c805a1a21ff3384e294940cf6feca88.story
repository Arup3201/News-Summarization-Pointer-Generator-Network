The British public has voted online shopping as the biggest technological development of the 21st century, just ahead of internet banking.

A third of those surveyed claim the ability to buy from websites rather than going into stores has had the biggest impact on their lives.

But the research also found Brits are often slow to adopt new technology, with 92 per cent holding off until they’ve seen others try it first.

The British public has voted online shopping as the biggest technological development of the 21st century, just ahead of internet banking

1. Being able to shop online (29 per cent)

2. Online banking (24 per cent)

3. Mobile internet devices (22 per cent)

4. Digital TV recorders (such as Sky+, Virgin and Tivo) (17 per cent)

5. Streaming films and TV online (three per cent)

This means 39 million people in the UK feel too nervous to try the latest advances and just eight per cent will give new devices and software a go.

Over half like to wait until new tech has proved itself in the market, while 19 per cent need to see friends or family take the plunge first.

It seems that once people get past their initial reluctance, most see the advances of the digital age as a good thing.

Almost all who took part in the survey said technology makes their lives easier, according to the research by energy firm E.ON.

The top five technology developments of the 21st century also included mobile internet, digital TV recorders and online film streaming services.

Nearly half of Brits confess to being sceptical in the early days of internet shopping, but two thirds now regularly buy from online retailers.

And an overwhelming 75 per cent claim they now bank online even though 43 per cent were nervous about it at the outset.

E.ON wanted to uncover attitudes to new technologies as it installs new smart meters in customers’ homes.

They found people are most interested in developments which refine existing practices and save us time or help with managing finances.

Jean Fiddes, from E.ON’s Smart Metering programme, said: 'Our research shows consumers are increasingly using technology to make their lives easier and save money on everyday costs.'

TV presenter and technology enthusiast Philippa Forrester, 45, said: “New technologies are often met with scepticism when they’re introduced.

'But later, many of us wonder what we ever did without them.

'Online shopping and banking and on-the-go entertainment were all at one time considered ‘new’ technologies but are now very much part of our day-to-day lives.

'And although we may get nostalgic about the good old days, many of us appreciate the convenience and control technology can offer.'
