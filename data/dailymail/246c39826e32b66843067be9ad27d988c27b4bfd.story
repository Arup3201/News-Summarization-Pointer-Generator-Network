Oprah Winfrey's best friend Gayle King has said she would place a bet on the veteran talk show host buying the embattled LA Clippers basketball team in the near future.

The CBS 'This Morning' presenter, 59, who has long been a confidante and business partner of Ms Winfrey, said 'If I was a betting man I'd say yes', when asked if her friend would buy the team.

Since current Clippers owner Donald 
Sterling was banned for life by NBA commissioner Adam Silver for making 
racist remarks, a number of high profile figures have been linked with 
the purchase of the club - including Floyd Mayweather, Oscar De La Hoya 
and Magic Johnson.

Ms Winfrey, 60, is believed to have already formed a consortium with entertainment mogul David Geffen, 71, and software entrepreneur Larry Ellison, 69, to take over the NBA team.

The trio of billionaires, who have a combined wealth of $60billion, are understood to be the favourites to buy the Clippers now that the NBA advisory panel has agreed to begin the process of selling the club.

Describing the consortium as 'quite a
 trifecta', Ms King said she 'wouldn't bet against' them being 
successful in their efforts to buy the Clippers.

They
 will nevertheless face strong competition - not least from boxer Floyd 
Mayweather, who hopes to invest the $40million he earned by beating 
Argentine Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas on Saturday.

Despite plenty of celebrity 
billionaire interest, 80-year-old Mr Sterling is still refusing to sell the team he bought for just $12 million in 1982, signalling a
 lengthy and costly legal battle with the NBA.

Earlier this week Clippers president Andy Roeser took an indefinite leave of absence as the league prepared to force a sale.

A spokesman for the National Basketball Association said Mr Roeser's departure from the club after 30 years would allow a new executive to 'begin on a clean slate'.

However the forced sale of the Clippers will require the approval of at least 21 owners of the NBA's other 28 clubs - and could even then still be opposed by Mr Sterling in court.

Ban: In April NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (pictured) announced a lifetime suspension and a $2.5million fine for Donald Sterling after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light

At the end of last month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced a lifetime suspension and a $2.5million fine for Mr Sterling after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light.

In the recorded conversations he could be heard telling his female friend V. Stiviano not to bring black friends to Clippers games or post photographs of herself with black people on Instagram.

'We stand together in condemning Mr. Sterling's views... They simply have no place in the NBA,' Silver said in a press conference to announce the lifetime ban.

The punishment is believed to be one of the most severe ever imposed on the owner of a professional sports team.

Based in celebrity-packed LA, the Clippers have no shortage of famous admirers.

And since the NBA announcement that it is preparing to force the sale of the basketball team, many of their well-known fans have been linked with the purchase of the club.

Earlier this week Canadian pop star Justin Bieber emerged as a potential candidate to lead a consortium that also includes boxer Floyd Mayweather and retired LA Lakers star Earvin 'Magic' Johnson.

Mayweather isn't the only boxer allegedly hoping to grab a piece of the Clippers, however. LA-born Oscar De La Hoya recently came out publically to announce he wants a piece of the franchise.

'To be an owner of an LA-based team would be a dream come true,' he told NBC4.

Also in the mix is the billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, who is understood to be putting together his own consortium to purchase the Clippers.

'Whether it’s me or somebody else, clearly there needs to be new ownership,' he told the LA Times.

Other big names linked to the purchase include the rappers Sean Combs, commonly known as P Diddy or Puff Daddy, and Rick Ross.

In the aftermath of Sterling's suspension, both men took to Twitter to state their interest in buying the club.

'I will always be a Knicks fan, but I am a business man. #DiddyBuyTheClippers #NameYourPrice',' said Combs, who is believed to be worth $700million.

Ross later added: 'I'd be interested investing in @LAclippers !!!! Make It #WingstopArena @WingstopCEO Lets Goooo !!!'
