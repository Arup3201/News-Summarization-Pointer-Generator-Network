Historians have spent years debating whether Stonehenge was once a complete circle.

Despite numerous tests and excavations, the mystery remained unsolved for almost 5,000 years.

But staff at the neolithic site believe the question has finally been answered - all because a hosepipe was too short.

Completing the picture: English Heritage believe the discovery has finally revealed the location of missing sarsen stones which once completed the Neolithic Stonehenge - here is what they believe it would have looked like

The mystery as to whether Stonehenge was round has been solved while the ground was being watered. A short hosepipe meant they could not reach the area where there is a gap in the outer circle. The ground then became parched and revealed where stones that have been missing for years once are believed to have once stood 

The hosepipe, which would have been stretched to the prehistoric ring of stones from the top right hand corner, could not reach the bottom left of the circle where there is a gap in the stones. It meant the grass was dry and revealed what are thought to be 'stone holes' 

Every summer stewards at the ancient monument in Wiltshire water the site to keep the grass healthy and green and the earth well nourished.

But this year the hosepipe was not log enough and failed to reach the outer part of the circle - where no stones stand.

The dried out land, which couldn't be reached, revealed marks of parched grass which were spotted by a volunteer who alerted experts.

English Heritage believe the discovery has finally revealed the location of missing sarsen stones which once completed the Neolithic circle.

Susan Greaney, from English Heritage, said: 'It's really significant, and it shows us just how much we still have to learn about Stonehenge.

'A lot of people assume we've excavated the entire site and everything we're ever going to know about the monument is known. But actually there's quite a lot we still don't know and there's quite a lot that can be discovered just through non-excavation methods.

'It's great that people who know the site really well and look at it every day were able to spot these parch marks and recognise them for what they were. We maintain the grass with watering when it's very dry in the summer, but our hosepipe doesn't reach to the other side of the stone circle.

'If we'd had a longer hosepipe we might not have been able to see them.'

Historians have long wondered whether Stonehenge was an intentionally-incomplete circle, but countless high resolution geophysical surveys and excavations have failed to give the answer.

Staff only water the site during the driest weeks of summer, but the hosepipe doesn't reach to the south-west quadrant where there is a gap in the circle.

Worker Tim Daw spotted the patches on the ground - now thought to be 'stone holes' - where the grass was more parched.

He said: 'I was standing on the public path looking at the grass near the stones and thinking that we needed to find a longer hosepipe to get the parched patches to green up.

'A sudden light-bulb moment in my head, and I remembered that the marks were where archaeologists had looked without success for signs that there had been stone holes, and that parch marks can signify them.

'I called my colleague over and he saw them and realised their possible significance as well. Not being archaeologists we called in the professionals to evaluate them.

'I am still amazed and very pleased that simply really looking at something, that tens of thousands of people had unwittingly seen, can reveal secrets that sophisticated machinery can't.'

Historians have long debated if the outer ring of the prehistoric stones was at one time a complete circle

But countless archaeologists have failed to find any evidence - despite numerous tests and excavations

However, when stewards went out to water the grounds, the length of the hosepipe meant one area was left dry

This left the ground parched and revealed where stones that have been missing could have been in place
