A 10-year-old boy’s message in a bottle about football and video games has travelled more than 2,500 miles and across the Atlantic Ocean.

Curtis Kipple, of Adams Basin, New York, wrote a letter last year along with his fellow fourth graders at the Fred W. Hill School in Brockport, New York.

The bottles were dropped into the Gulf Stream by a fisherman from North Carolina's Outer Banks - and the young pupil’s turned up in the Azores.

Message: Curtis Kipple wrote a letter that travelled across the Atlantic Ocean in a bottle and ended up being found in the Azores (file picture)

The school received an email last week from a tiny fishing village on the Azores archipelago off Portugal, which left the pupil ‘glassy-eyed’.

‘It was really special,’ his fourth-grade teacher Chris Albrecht told the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester. ‘I was blown away.

‘About 80 per cent of my students have never seen the ocean. That Curtis's bottle made it across the Atlantic Ocean is pretty amazing.’

He said his students took a month to write their letters and he sent the bottles to Kitty Hawk in North Carolina with his mother last December.

‘I wrote about how I like to play football with my dad and video games,’ Curtis, now a fifth-grader, told the Democrat and Chronicle.

The glass bottles were dropped 30 miles off shore into the Gulf Stream by an Outer Banks fisherman earlier this year in March.

Curtis’s bottle was found last week in the village of Terceira - 2,589 miles away from Brockport by a father and son.

‘My brother and my father (woke) up earlier today and went to sea to catch a seafood very common here,’ Ana Ponte, 25, wrote in an email.

'Mind-blowing': Chris Albrecht, the boy's fourth-grade teacher at Fred W. Hill School in Brockport, New York, was amazed

She said they ‘found a bottle with a message from a boy Curtis Kipple’. But Curtis's wasn’t the first to turn up in a far-flung location.

Student Adam VerSteeg's bottle was also found - in June, by Jude Major on the beach of Clam Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada.

‘The project exceeded my wildest expectations,’ Mr Albrecht told the Democrat and Chronicle, adding the discovery of both is 'mind-blowing'.
