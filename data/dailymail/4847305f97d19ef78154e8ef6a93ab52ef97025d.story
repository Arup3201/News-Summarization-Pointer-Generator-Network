Health officials are investigating a possible case of Ebola at Primary Children's Hospital in Utah, it has been confirmed.

The patient, who has not been identified, had recently traveled to a country in Africa where transmission of the Ebola virus has not yet been reported, chief of pediatric infectious diseases Dr Andrew Pavia told a press conference.

He said the patient was admitted on Wednesday and insists it is unlikely they have the deadly virus.

Revealed: A patient who has just returned from an African country not yet affected by Ebola is being tested for the deadly virus at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, today

However, medics at the Salt Lake City hospital are for the first time employing the center's emergency plan created to tackle the disease.

A spokesman said: 'While we have determined it is unlikely that the patient has Ebola virus, Primary Children's has taken this opportunity to use the emergency plan that we have been working on for the past few months in order to provide the maximum protection to staff, patients, families, and the greater community in the event we do have a patient with an Ebola infection in the future.'

Pavia said the hospital was merely taking advantage of the opportunity to test its emergency system and that an alternative diagnosis became evident while doctors worked with the patient today, KSL reported.

He added that the patient would pose no risk of infection to other patients or staff as the virus is spread through close bodily contact, not through the air or casual contact.

He did not reveal details of the alternative diagnosis.

Tests taken today have been sent to the CDC's headquarters for evaluation as part of the hospital's test.

All US hospitals have been preparing to handle cases of Ebola, he said, adding: 'The possibility that somebody comes back to any state with Ebola is real. That should not make people nervous.' 

According to a press release, Primary Children's has been working for several months on an emergeny plan that provides 'the maximum protection to staff, patients, families, and the greater community in the event we do have a patient with an Ebola infection in the future.'

It comes as it emerges Thomas Duncan, the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in the US, could have been in contact with up to 100 American citizens before being isolated.

And today it emerged there is a possible case in Hawaii. 

Four members of 42-year-old Thomas Eric Duncan's family have been legally ordered to stay home as a precaution even though they are not showing symptoms, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement on Thursday. Violating the order could result in criminal charges.

Some parents have temporarily removed their children from Dallas schools after learning that the five students may have come into contact with the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.
