Sheffield United midfielder Jose Baxter says Nigel Clough’s knockout specialists fancy their chances of more success in the FA Cup.

The League One team have lost only two of 19 FA and League Cup matches under Clough and reached the semi-final last year.

‘We were just having a laugh in the changing room saying we’ve got to be favourites now after a few have gone out,’ Baxter said.

‘There are still some great teams in there, though, and that’s what the Cup is all about, the underdogs beating the big boys.’

The Blades must first see off League One promotion rivals Preston in a replay at Bramall Lane a week tomorrow.

Indeed, Simon Grayson’s side looked like they were on the way through to the fifth round for the first time since 2008 when Paul Gallagher’s dipping free-kick from 35 yards gave them a deserved 19th-minute lead.

However, Clough’s team improved after the break and secured a replay when Diego de Girolamo scored from six yards with 22 minutes left.

Preston defender David Buchanan warned: ‘They might think it’s all over but if we set off like we did in the first half today we know we have enough quality.’
