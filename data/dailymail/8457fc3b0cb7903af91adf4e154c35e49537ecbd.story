Michael Dunn is on trial today for the first-degree murder in the November 23, 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis

A Florida murder trial, stemming from an argument over loud music at a gas station that ended in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, began today reviving a debate over the state's gun control and self-defense laws.

Michael Dunn, 47, faces first-degree murder charges in the death of high school junior 17-year-old Jordan Davis on November 23, 2012.

The white, middle-aged software engineer opened fire on a car with four black teenage boys inside that was parked next to him in the parking lot of a Jacksonville gas station convenience store in northeast Florida.

Dunn has said he feared for his life, 
drawing comparisons to the trial of George Zimmerman, the former central
 Florida neighborhood watchman who was acquitted last year of murder 
after saying he shot a 17-year-old unarmed black teenager, Trayvon 
Martin, in self-defense.

Dunn
 said he had asked the teenagers to turn down the volume of their music.

From the back passenger seat, Davis refused and the two exchanged 
words. Dunn says he opened fire because he saw the barrel of a gun 
pointed out the back window at him, though police found no weapon.

The
 case has garnered national and international media attention because of
 the racial overtones and the self-defense claims. Like Zimmerman, Dunn 
said he feared a black teenager who was unarmed.

If found guilty, Dunn faces life in prison. Prosecutors say they won't seek the death penalty.

Dunn's
 attorney, Cory Strolla, has filed motions asking the judge not to allow
 references in the trial to comments Dunn made in jailhouse letters or 
phone calls where he referred to Davis and to some inmates as 'thugs', 
and made other 'alleged racial comments,' according to court documents.

Life lost: Police say Davis was unarmed, and no weapon was found in the SUV where he was riding

In a letter that Dunn sent to a local television reporter, he described Davis as a thug.

'This
 case has never been about loud music,' Dunn wrote to news anchor 
Heather Crawford in October.

'This case is about a local thug 
threatening to kill me because I dared to ask him to turn the music 
down.'

Strolla also asked that the judge bar the prosecution from referring to Davis as a 'victim'.

The
 media attention will also thrust back into the spotlight Jacksonville's
 state attorney Angela Corey, the special prosecutor who was chosen by 
Florida Governor Rick Scott to handle the Zimmerman case.

She
 is also the prosecutor in the case of Marissa Anderson, a Jacksonville 
woman sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing what she said was a 
warning shot at her abusive husband.

Jordan's parents, Ron Davis and Lucia McBath, said they plan to be in the courtroom throughout the trial.

Dunn says he opened fire because he saw the barrel of a gun pointed out the back window at him, though police found no weapon

'I
 need to experience what happened to my son that day,' Ron Davis told 
Reuters. 'As a parent you want to know, ''What happened to my son' Why 
did you do this to my son.'''

Since
 their son's death, Davis and McBath have become advocates for gun 
control and for changing Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which allows 
people in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend 
themselves rather than retreat.

They
 have testified before the Florida state legislature and the United 
States Congress. Both have appeared on national television, talking 
about the case and about their son.

After
 the trial, Davis said he will continue to work to have the state Stand 
Your Ground law revised to include a duty to retreat. If someone is 
threatened in public, Davis said, the law should require that he or she 
try to defuse the situation rather than use deadly force.

That requirement might have changed the outcome for his son, he said.

'In
 your home, you have every right to protect your castle,' Davis said. 
'In public, we can't all walk around acting like we are in our home, 
telling people what to do in a public place. We have to share the public
 space.'

Tragic: Davis, pictured left and right, was riding in the back seat of an SUV with his three friends after a shopping trip in 2012 when the confrontation happened. The teen's companions were unarmed

Grieving: Davis' parents, Lucia Kay McBath, left, and Ron Davis, right, called on Florida lawmakers to strengthen what they believe to be weak gun laws and repeal the controversial 'Stand Your Ground' legislation

Dunn and his fianceé, Rhonda Rouer, were in Jacksonville on the night of the shooting to attend a wedding when they stopped at a Gate gas station in Baymeadows to pick up  a bottle of wine before returning to their hotel, authorities say.

They parked their Jetta next to the red Dodge Durango SUV containing Davis and his three friends - Tevin Thompson, Leland Brunson and Tommie Stornes - who were listening to rap music on their way home after shopping at Black Friday sales at a mall.

Dunn asked the teens to turn down the volume of the music, but, his attorney said, the teens turned up the volume, threatened Dunn and brandished a shotgun.

Dunn grabbed a pistol from the glove compartment of his car and opened fire, before driving away, authorities say. Police said no weapon was found on the teens.

Defense: Dunn's attorneys claim that their client felt threatened because he allegedly spotted the four black teens inside the SUV training a shotgun at him

Dunn was taken into custody at his oceanfront townhouse about 170 miles south of Jacksonville the day after the shooting.

According to the lawyer, Dunn heard the teens in the SUV say: ‘Kill that mother******,’ ‘That mother****** is dead.’

Lemonidis said in the next moment, Dunn saw a shotgun coming up over the rim of the heavily tinted SUV containing four black men whose ages he did not know at the time.

‘But he knows a shotgun when he sees one because he got his first gun as a gift from his grandparents when he was in third grade,’ the lawyer said.
