It appears that friends who Bunga Bunga together, stay together, as two of the women linked to Silvio Berlusconi’s infamous sex parties were seen lingerie shopping together earlier today.

Barbara Guerra and Alessandra Sorcinelli tried on a number of lacy outfits in what appears to be an Agent Provocateur store in central Milan, parading in barely-there threads in full view of passers by.

The girls were pictured on the same day as an Italian court agreed to postpone Berlusconi’s wiretap leaks trial until after the February national election in which he is a prime ministerial candidate.

Barbara Guerra and Alessandra 
Sorcinelli’s shopping trip saw them flaunt their bodies in black 
underwear and reach for various erotic toys, including a 
rhinestone-encrusted whip.

As well as the corsets and knickers the girls also, somewhat bizarrely, went for a pair of Barack Obama t-shirts.

Both
girls were among the 30-odd women who appeared in court documents as 
authorities investigated Silvio Berlusconi’s sleazy parties in 2011, and have also been connected to him prior to the probe.

Ms
Guerra began her ‘career’ in a reality-TV show on Berlusconi’s 
television network after which she is alleged to have stayed in a Milan 
apartment belonging to the former Italian PM in exchange for attending 
his ‘Bunga Bunga’ parties.

The 32-year-old model and showgirl was first linked to Berlusconi in July 2009, when she was said to have stayed at a health centre in November 2008, where Berlusconi was treated for back pain.

As for weather girl Alessandra, 27, bank records uncovered by Italian prosecutors in January 2011 showed that Berlusconi paid her more than £100,000 for attending his infamous sex parties - money disguised as a 'non-interest-earning loan' paid to 'help with studies'.

The payments started in 2010 and averaged
£8,500 a month – a figure Ms Sorcinelli refers to in a text 
message to Mr Berlusconi’s aide, Giuseppe Spinelli, which read: ‘May I 
urgently remind you of the 10,000 euro bank transfer.’

Silvio Berlusconi announced last month that he intends to run for Prime Minister for the fourth time in the February elections.

Today an Italian court accepted a request from his defense team and agreed to postpone the wiretap leaks trial until March.

Prosecutors have asked for a one-year jail sentence for Berlusconi for his alleged role in the publication of wiretap transcripts in a newspaper owned by his media empire and three years for his brother Paolo, the publisher of Milan newspaper Il Giornale.

The ruling was in contrast to the decision by another court, which rejected Berlusconi's bid to halt his sex-for-hire trial. That ruling makes a verdict likely before the vote. Berlusconi says he is innocent of all charges.
