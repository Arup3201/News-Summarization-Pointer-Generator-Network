Tragic: James Marcus Howe had just moved to the neighborhood with his wife and young son when he was killed

Police have released two surveillance camera images of a dark Ford Mustang in the hope of catching the two thugs who broke into a reality TV director's Los Angeles home and shot him dead.

James Marcus Howe, 42, had worked on such successful shows as 'America's Next Top Model,' 'A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila' and 'Cake Boss: The Next Great Baker.'

He was gunned down and his wife was wounded when two men forced their way into his house in the Glassell Park neighborhood of the city on November 27 - the day before Thanksgiving.

The LAPD hopes that the images of the
 suspected getaway car, combined with a $75,000 reward from community 
leaders will lead to tips about who killed Howe, KTLA reports.

Howe's wife, Danae Howe, survived and was able to describe the suspects to police.

Police said they are looking for two men in their late teens or early 20s who committed the robbery and shootings.

A woman of the same age was spotted in the getaway car.

Police say the three robbers were posing as door-to-door salesmen. The brazen robbery took place in broad daylight, just before 11am.Â 

LAPD Detective Harold Dicroce told CBS 2 that Howe and his wife recently moved to the neighborhood with their 6-year-old son.

The child was not home at the time of the shooting and is being cared for by his aunt.
