Head coach Ange Postecoglou said: 'He's not quite right to play and at this stage of the tournament ... we are better to give it a few days extra rest and we will re-assess where he's at for the game against (South) Korea.'

Oman, which plays Australia on Tuesday in Sydney, lost their opening match of the tournament 1-0 to South Korea on Saturday. Australia and South Korea are expected to vie for top honors in Group A of the 16-team tournament.
