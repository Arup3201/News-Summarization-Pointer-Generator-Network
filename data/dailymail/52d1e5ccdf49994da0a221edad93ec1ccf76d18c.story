An 18-year-old woman barred from a New Year’s Eve concert by DJ Rusko because she did not have any ID was allegedly raped by six young men.

The teenager was discovered naked, bleeding and beaten into a coma nearby the Congress Theater in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday night.

Security caught three teenage boys who allegedly had blood on them and had just told the guards they had seen a naked girl on the pavement.

'Rape': The incident began on Saturday when the woman was denied access to the $35-a-ticket concert at the Congress Theater in Chicago, Illinois

‘You can still see the blood,’ Danny Medina, 33, who has lived in the local area for 20 years, told the Chicago Tribune. ‘It's very sad.’

The incident began when the woman was denied access to the $35-a-ticket concert which was open to anyone aged at least 17 years old.

But the woman was denied entry with no ID so went across the road and sat down in front of a Mexican restaurant, a theatre employee said.

He told the Chicago Sun-Times he saw her walking with six young men, some of whom told him 20 minutes later they saw a naked girl by the road.

‘She was completely unconscious,’ witness Elijah Billot told ABC affiliate WLS. ‘She was bleeding from the back of her head.’

The incident happened around 9:30pm, before Rusko had even taken to the stage and while opening acts were performing.

The woman was taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center and was in a critical condition, police told the Chicago Sun-Times.
