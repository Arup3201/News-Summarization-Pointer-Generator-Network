They are the feminists famous for staging topless protests, with Vladimir Putin, Paris Fashion Week and Germany's Next Top Model among those treated to a bare-breasted display.

Now founder member and leader of FEMEN France, Inna Shevchenko, 23, has thrown open the doors of the organisation's Paris HQ to a British film crew.

Shevchenko, who was given political asylum in France last year, has masterminded the expansion of the feminist organisation, adding branches in Canada, Germany and Israel to the original Ukrainian movement.

But despite catapulting the movement to international prominence, Shevchenko says much more still needs to be done. 

'When they ask me how [FEMEN] started, I say I have a big reason because I was born as a woman in this time and in this society,' she elaborates.

'And at some point, you look around and you understand that you don't want to
 live like your mother, you don't want to live like your aunt, you don't
 want to live like your neighbours.

'You want something different but you
 don't know what because no one told you that there was something different.

'At the beginning it was just anger inside and we still keep it inside and it's growing with every new action - it's growing.'

'Actions' over the last year have included an angry protest against violence during a pro-Russian rally in the Crimean city of Simferopol, mobbing Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during a visit to a polling station and interrupting anti-abortion rallies in Canada and Spain.

Other targets have included Russia's President Putin (still a favourite), religious groups of all denominations and prostitution.

Shevchenko herself is no stranger to any of them, and is regularly to be found in the thick of the action, topless and daubed with painted slogans.

'We're using topless style of protest to show that women are protesting,' she explains of the group's famous bare-breasted protests.

The method even extends to the internet with Putin (yes, him again) becoming the target of a slew of topless photos, each featuring the legend: 'F*** YOU PUTIN!'

It's an approach that can sometimes prove controversial, as Shevchenko herself knows only too well after being forced to flee Ukraine following a stunt that provoked the ire of authorities and church groups alike.

'One year ago I chainsawed through an eight-metre wooden cross in the middle of main square in Kiev,' she remembers fondly.

'We
 were protesting about the connection between the garments of church and the 
influence of religion on society.'

But her protest, which made headlines around the world, would have serious consequences for the then fledgling campaigner.

'One morning I woke up 
because I heard the secret service knocking on the door,' she reveals. 'I was kind 
of ready for that situation and I
 left the country through the window, through the balcony of my 
apartment.

'It was on the first floor and I had my passport and mobile 
telephone and since that day I didn't come back to Ukraine.'

Her flight left her cut off from friends and family in Ukraine, although the bullish Shevchenko says being part of FEMEN makes up for the separation.

'It's not my job, what I do,' she explains. 'It's not my job, it's my life. I'm activist more than daughter of 
someone and I'm activist more than, I don't know, friend of someone and 
I'm activist more than girlfriend of someone.

'It's not my job, it's my life. That's it. How many times do I have to repeat it?'

Inna Shevchenko appears on Outsiders with Darren McMullen, Friday at 10pm on National Geographic Channel.
