It looks like a beautifully choreographed scene, as a wide-eyed sea lion drifts through a tunnel of silvery fish.

But in fact the gorgeous natural spectacle is a frantic life-or-death struggle, as the thousands of schooling fish thrash and dart through the waters of the Pacific Ocean.

Desperate to escape the hungry sea lion, they instinctively form swirling herd formations in a bid to escape. The fish - black salema, a type of bottom feeder - form elegant patterns beneath the waves.

Their survival techniques can adapt instantly as predators stalk around the mass of fish, creating new shapes such as the  tunnel.

Underwater photographer David Fleetham captured the rare moment in the waters around the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.

He said: 'Thankfully I was at the right place at the right time. The school was enormous and moved as if a single creature.

'Galapagos sharks and sea lions had worked the school up into the shallows were they were trapped against the island. In the shallows, the school spread out to be almost the size of a football field.'

Scramble: The sea lion glides through a mass of black salema fish, which dart out of its way to form a tunnel

Spontaneous: The fish can dart into and out of instinctive formations such as this, which keep the largest possible number of fish away from predators

Hunted: The fish also fell prey to a Galapagos shark in the sustained attack. Predators can work together to peel off fish from their defensive clusters

Dive-bomb: A predatory bird was also pictured taking a bite out of the fish. The schools are often forced towards the surface by hungry fish, where they can also be picked off by diving birds
