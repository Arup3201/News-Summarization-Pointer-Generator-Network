The flu epidemic is raging across the country with 36 states reporting high levels of the outbreak, according to authorities.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared a national flu epidemic on Tuesday as this year's, virulent mutated strain, the H3N2 virus, swept from coast to coast. 

The Midwest and southeast of the country were being hardest hit with cases. The CDC said the flu vaccine currently on the market doesn't prevent that strain's spread.

Between October 1 and December 20, CDC figures show that 15 children have died from the virus and four in the week before Christmas.

The flu epidemic was raging across the country with 36 states seeing high levels of the outbreak 

Six children in Tennessee have died this year from the flu, according to the state's Department of Health and so far East Tennessee Children's hospital has seen 442 children with flu this month. 

On Monday, Anne Arundel Medical Center in Maryland announced that an increased number of patients were coming to the hospital and visitors would be limited. 

Other Maryland hospitals including Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Northwest Hospital in Randallstown and Johns Hopkins, also put precautions in place, according to CBS. 

Delaware has seen nearly ten times the number of flu cases this year compared to the same time period last year.

The Delaware Division of Public Health says there were 632 reported flu cases through December 20.  For the same time period last year, there were just 70 flu cases.

Health officials say the uptick reflects earlier influenza activity being reported throughout the country. 

Those particularly at risk are those over 65 and younger than four. Across the nation, 2,500 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis.

According to the CDC, data from 122 U.S. cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline and is at the epidemic threshold of 6.8 per cent.  

About 90 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent H3N2 sub-type, the CDC reported. 

Another state hit hard has been Minnesota, where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year's flu strain is particularly strong.

The flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in December while battling the illness.

Shannon Zwanziger, a 17-year-old senior at Owatonna High School in Minnesota died at the Mayo Clinic in early December from the flu.

Initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat, Shannon deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother's arms after being sick for one week.

Despite the paramedics and best efforts, she passed away.

The CDC admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain, H3N2.

That strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly.

'Though we cannot predict what will happen the rest of this flu season, it's possible we may have a season that's more severe than most,' said CDC director, Dr Tom Frieden.

CDC officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated. 

Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. Last winter, flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall, which experts consider relatively good.

Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading killers. On average, about 24,000 Americans die each flu season, according to the CDC.

Nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter's flu season.

Current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus, depending on the product. 

The ingredients are selected very early in the year, based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter.

The ingredients always include a Type A H3N2 flu virus. The most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug. 

The three most deadly flu seasons of the last 10 years — in the winters of 2003-2004, 2007-2008, and 2012-2013 — were H3N2 seasons.

In March, after the H3N2 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway, health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of H3N2. 'This is not something that's been around before,' Frieden said.

But health officials weren't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the United States this winter until recently, they said. 

Lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of H3N2. Specifically, about 48 percent of the H3N2 samples seen so far were well matched to what's in the vaccine, but 52 percent were not, the CDC said.

An official with one vaccine manufacturer — GlaxoSmithKline — emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine. 

He also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain.

'We're at the very beginning of flu season, and it's quite possible different strains will predominate,' said Dr. Leonard Friedland, director of scientific affairs for GSK's vaccines business.
