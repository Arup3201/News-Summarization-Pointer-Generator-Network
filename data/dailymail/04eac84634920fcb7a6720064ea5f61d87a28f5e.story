Twelve red roses ordered from Marks & Spencer's website will cost upwards of £40, while a bunch from Waitrose is priced at £15.

Bargain: Lidly have produced a £3 bunch of 12 roses to help those who would like to make a romantic gesture despite the economic squeeze

Shop worker Daniel Wilson, 25, from Winchester, Hampshire, said: "They're so cheap it means I can give one rose to 12 different women.

'It's refreshing to see such an affordable gift as stores usually take advantage of people wanting to impress on Valentine's Day.'

A Lidl spokeswoman said: "We always aim to be as competitive as possible on all of our flowers.

'We always aim to give our customers the very best value across all of our ranges in store.

'We understand that, despite the current squeeze in income, people still wish to give red roses on Valentine's Day.

'We hope that these beautiful roses at this stunning price means that no one has to miss out.'

Impact: 'Attractively presented' - but this bouquet of Freedom roses from Marks & Spencer will set you back £40

Earlier this month Good Housekeeping magazine carried out its annual red rose test - and found that the best bouquet of a dozen red roses came from Serenata Flowers.

The magazine ordered the bouquets, all priced between £25 and £55, anonymously and rated them out of 100 based on various criteria, including ease of ordering, delivery service, initial wow factor and longevity.

They rated 14 bouquets from online retailers - and found that Serenata's bunch (£44.99 for 12 including free delivery) scored top marks with an impressive 80 out of 100.

The deep red medium-stemmed roses were rated as beautifully presented, perfectly complementing the thick foliage and mild fragrance.  

Wow factor: Seranata's 12 rose bouquet was rated best of the bunch by Good Housekeeping

The Elegant Red Rose Vase from Interflora in association with Tesco (£49.99 for 12, plus £5.99 delivery) was joint runner up with the 'attractively presented' M&S Autograph Freedom Roses Bouquet (£40 for 12 with free delivery), both scoring 78 out of 100.

The 'voluptuous' David Austin Darcey Classic Rose Bouquet (£49.95 for 10 with free delivery) scored 77 out of 100, closely followed by the 12 Red Roses from Bunches with 76 out of 100, also top in terms of longevity – lasting an 'amazing' 15 days.

Good Housekeeping Consumer Director Caroline Bloor says: 'What could be more romantic than getting a bouquet of red roses? But how do you know if you’re getting value for money?

'With so many online delivery services to choose from we have no way of knowing which ones will deliver that gorgeous bouquet on the website on time, have the wow factor and last well.

'In our Good Housekeeping tests and across all criteria the dozen red roses from Serenata Flowers were simply a cut above the rest.'
