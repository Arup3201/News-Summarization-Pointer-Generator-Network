Philippe Coutinho was pleased with how Liverpool did last season, but admitted that he wanted to score more goals for the club.

The 22-year-old Brazilian has found the net eight times in his 50 appearances for the club and has said he intends to improve upon that tally 

'There's a lot to improve and one of my objectives for this season is to score more goals,' the Brazilian told LFCTV.

Tally: Philippe Coutinho says he wants to score more goals for Liverpool this season

'I also want to increase my participation during games. Both are things I try to work hard on and improve in training.'

Brendan Rodgers' side came within touching distance of a first league title for 24 years last season, but ultimately fell short.

Despite the loss of European Golden Boot winner Luis Suarez, Coutinho says Liverpool will be even more focused on winning the title this year.

Transfers: The 22-year-old said Liverpool's new signings will help propel the club to a higher level

He said: 'I am ready and I hope all goes well this season with me and mainly with the team. We want to have a good campaign, as we had last year. It'll be particularly important this year with having the Champions League to play.'

'Our ambitions are similar to last year's, although with a greater focus on the trophy this year as we were very close to winning it last season.

'And certainly the fact that Liverpool have brought in new, high quality players will help us to produce another great season.'
