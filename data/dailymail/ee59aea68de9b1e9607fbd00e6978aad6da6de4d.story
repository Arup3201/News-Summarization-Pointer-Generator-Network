A teacher who oversaw an art history lesson during which pupils cut themselves with blades has resigned from a £7,500 a year 'alternative' private school.

The part-time teacher was suspended after pupils at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire sliced themselves as part of the lesson, and later resigned from her post as school chiefs were investigating the incident.

The fee-paying school, which follows the Rudolf Steiner model of education and aims to 'bring joy into the learning process', confirmed the teacher concerned had resigned ahead of a disciplinary hearing.

Incident: The part-time teacher has resigned after pupils cut themselves during her art history lesson at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire

Ringwood, which caters to pupils aged from three to 18, said the member of staff had acted without the knowledge of superiors.

'We can confirm an incident took place during an art history lesson on March 19 during which a part-time teacher, subsequently suspended pending a full investigation, acted independently without our knowledge,' school administrator Nigel Revill said.

'The teacher concerned resigned during the disciplinary process, before a disciplinary hearing could take place.

'The teacher is no longer employed by the school and we have no plans to reinstate her,' Mr Revill added.

Ringwood has stressed the incident was an isolated one and said it is no longer under investigation.

The teacher was reported to the School Inspection Service, which oversees independent schools, and to Dorset County Council's safeguarding team, Mr Revill said.

He added that the school had been advised by both organisations it had taken the correct steps in informing them of the incident at the earliest opportunity.

Fees for the school on the border of Hampshire and Dorset range from £3,610 to £7,500 per year.

Ringwood is one of more than 900 Steiner Waldorf schools worldwide.

The approach is based upon the principles of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher and social reformer who identified three broad stages in child development - each around seven years long.

In the early years Waldorf education focuses on providing practical and hands-on activities to encourage creative play, before moving on to developing pupils' artistic expression and social capacities.

Developing critical understanding and fostering idealism is at the heart of secondary education at Waldorf Steiner schools.

On its website Ringwood describes the curriculum as 'uniquely designed to meet the developing emotional and intellectual needs of children'.

'It works through the values of goodness, beauty and truth, encouraging children to seek these within themselves and in the world around, creating a warm and encouraging environment in which children can grow and learn,' it reads.

The name Waldorf stems from Steiner's first school established in Stuttgart in 1919, which was for the children of employees at the Waldorf Astoria factory.
