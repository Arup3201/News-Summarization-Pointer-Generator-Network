They say that the property market is all about 'location, location, location' - and this modest bungalow could prove the saying right.

Not only did the small house sell for an extraordinary £1.5million, but when it was demolished the empty plot went back on the market for double the price.

But in the so-called 'Millionaires' Row' of Sandbanks, Dorset, £3million is considered a perfectly reasonable price to pay for an tiny patch of scrubland - as long as it comes with planning permission attached.

Sold: This bungalow was bought for £1.5million before being promptly demolished by the buyer

Gone: The one-acre plot is now standing completely empty - but it is set to sell for £3million because it has planning permission attached

Replacement: Architects' plans show how the space will be filled by a modernist five-bedroom home worth £5million

Close-up: The house is set to include five en-suite bedrooms, a home cinema and a gym

Poole Harbour, where the house is located, is the fourth most expensive place in the world for residential property and 'blank canvas' plots like this one are hugely sought-after.  

It would cost up to £1million pounds to build the three-storey home from plan, and when it is complete the five-bedroom property will have a market value of £5million. 

The land is likely to be bought by a developer - or a millionaire with the time and money to build their dream home.  

Alternatively, the estate agents are marketing the property as a 'turnkey' proposition where a buyer can pay £5million pounds and move straight into the house after it is built. 

Work in progress: The site is currently boarded off but is nonetheless on the market for £3million

Scrubland: In the bizarre world of the Sandbanks property market, empty plots can be more valuable than actual houses

Potential: The plot's value comes from its strategic position overlooking the sea in the exclusive resort

The site is in a small cul-de-sac called The Horseshoe, where until recently England cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott owned a house.  

It overlooks Poole Harbour, enjoys direct access to the waters and even has its own private beach. It is just around the corner from football manager Harry Redknapp's house.

The house that was demolished was a three-bedroom bungalow dating back to the 1920s that neighbours said was in a 'good state of repair.' It was built in the 1920s.

The Horseshoe contains nine properties, all of which directly back on to Poole Harbour, but only one of them has so far been redeveloped into a modern, luxury home to match the profile of the area's new ultra-rich residents.

Estate 
agents Tailor Made describe the land sale as a 'superb opportunity to 
build your own bespoke beachside home on the world renowned Sandbanks 
peninsula.'

Adrian
 Dunford, of Tailor Made, said Sandbanks is a unique location where 
'blank canvas' sites are more attractive and valuable than the house 
already on them. 

'We are in an area where residental properties are very much viewed for their plot value,' he said. 'It is about the potential of the plot rather than what is already on it.  

'Knocking a house down and getting planning permission for a new one gives the property a much greater value than before, no matter how old or new the house. 

Desirable: It is the position of the house on the edge of Poole Harbour which explains its inflated price tag

Looking out: The view from the beach out over the harbour

'If you have the money, you can build your dream home in one of the best locations that there is.  

'The market here is moving at a real pace. We have just sold a property for the equivalent of £1,250 per square foot, which is a record.'  

Poole Borough Council have approved plans for a brand new house with five en-suite bedrooms, open plan living space, a home cinema and a gymnasium.  

Outside there is room for a double garage, a boat store, four mooring spaces and a rear terrace with spectacular harbour views.

Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, perched on a peninsula at the mouth of Poole Harbour near Bournemouth.

Every
 home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, 
with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the
 English Channel.

The
 property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past 
few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with 
cutting-edge new properties to meet demand.

Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow.

£3million can get you nothing more than an empty lot in the ultra-exclusive resort of Sandbanks in Dorset.

But
 elsewhere, that sum could get you a lot further - for £3million you 
could buy a Scottish mansion, a London townhouse, a Lucian Freud 
painting or the world's most expensive car.

Town house: This home near London's Borough Market became Britain's most expensive council house when it was sold for £3million; it was subsequently taken over by squatters

Scottish mansion: The Frognal estate in Troon, South Ayrshire, was bought by record lottery winner Colin and Christine Weir for £3million, having previously been run as a hotel

Masterpiece: Head on a Green Sofa, a 1961 portrait of Belinda Lambton by Lucian Freud which the artist considered one of his greatest works, was bought at auction last month for just under £3million

Sports car: The Lamborghini Veneno is the most expensive car ever built, with a sticker price of £2.8million; only three were ever produced, and each one found a buyer
