Online Christmas shopping is set to start early, with auction site eBay predicting that Sunday November 30 will be its busiest day of the year.

Cyber Monday, which falls on December 1, is traditionally the busiest online shopping day, as buyers rush to make sure all their orders arrive on time.

The website 'tends to see a sharp rise in sales' on this particular day each year as people start to think about their festive shopping lists early.

The rush for the checkout is thought to be partly as a result of warnings that delivery companies may not be able to cope with a huge increase in the number of parcels sent.

The day has been dubbed Super Sunday and comes hot on the heels of Black Friday, which precedes it by two days.

Falling  on November 28th, Black Friday is seen as the start of the biggest High Street shopping weekend of the year. 

On Super Sunday, eBay estimates that 1,800 gifts will be purchased per minute from a selection of more than 800 million items available in total.

Since the launch of the site's Christmas Shop,  tech, lifestyle and classic toys have proved the most popular presents among shoppers so far.

Xbox, iPad, Bose Sound Bar, Lego and Playmobil are among the brands set to take prime position under trees across the nation, report their analysts.

Nevertheless, traditional guests remain popular with five teddy bears, 57 board games, 85 games consoles, 99 tablets, 258 mobile phones and 318 handbags already sold every hour on the site.

Black Friday began in the US but has now spread to the UK and sees retailers slash prices as they attempt to kickstart a Christmas rush.

It got its name because it was traditionally said to be the point at which American retailers began to turn a profit for the year, or go 'into the black'.

Visa Europe reported that on Black Friday last year, Britons spent £1 million every three minutes to snap up the best deals in the shops - equal to an astonishing £6,000 per second.

Cyber Monday, meanwhile, is a more recent phenomenon and takes place the Monday after Thanksgiving Day in the US.

It is the internet equivalent of Black Friday, allowing shoppers to skip the hustle and bustle of the shops and purchase all their presents from the comfort of their sofa.
