The CIA believes Edward Snowden may have been recruited by the Russians as long as seven years ago and could have passed on a ‘treasure trove’ of secrets.  

The US intelligence agency is investigating whether the fugitive, now living in Moscow, betrayed his country by working for the Putin regime as a double agent as early as 2007.

Robert Baer, a former senior CIA official, told the Mail that the fact Snowden had ended up in Russia was a likely sign that Moscow had signed him up when he was working for the spy agency in Geneva.

Edward Snowden says he acted on behalf of the American people when he revealed secret NSA files

Revelations: NBC's Brian Williams traveled to Moscow to interview Snowden about his case

He said that if secrets had been 
passed to the Russians it may have helped them in their recent 
annexation of Crimea, as they could have changed the codes and 
frequencies of their communications to stop the US listening in. 
Security chiefs in the UK are furious at the Snowden leaks and say 
incalculable damage has been done by them.

However, they do not share the belief that Snowden was recruited by the Russians while working for the CIA in Geneva.

And
 in an interview yesterday, Snowden denied he had any relationship with 
the Russian government, claiming he had the best interests of the 
American public at heart when he leaked secret files to the media.

The
 fugitive caused outrage last year by releasing thousands of National 
Security Agency documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post.  

They
 detailed the NSA’s practice of harvesting data on millions of telephone
 calls made in the US and around the world, and revealed the agency had 
snooped on foreign leaders.  

He fled the US last May and has been living under temporary asylum in Russia ever since.  

Mr
 Baer said he had been told by contacts at the CIA that they were 
carrying out a ‘damage assessment’ into whether Snowden handed sensitive
 information to the Russians.  

‘They
 are looking at the possibility that information was passed on,’ he 
said. ‘It’s a damage assessment – clearly what he saw in Geneva has to 
be looked at and it has to be assumed that he passed it on to Russia.’

From
 2007 to 2009, Snowden was posted to Geneva, where he worked as a 
‘communicator’, looking through intelligence reports and passing them on
 to headquarters in Langley, Virginia.  

He
 was so trusted during this time that he was chosen to provide President
 Obama with support at the 2008 Nato summit in Romania.

But Mr Baer said he could have ‘betrayed’ his country by passing information to Moscow.

‘You’d
 be seeing the intelligence briefings that Geneva would get. You’d also 
be getting NSA reports. That’s the sort of regular stuff he’d be getting
 across his desk.  

‘He was a disaster there. As a communicator he will have seen everything.’

Snowden could also have seen information sent by British intelligence, Mr Baer said.

‘There’s
 a daily intelligence briefing which gives you a summary of chatter and 
intercepts and diplomatic communication. He could have easily given it 
to Russia. I think it is just horrendous.’

Robert Baer says Edward Snowden's actions have hugely damaged U.S. and UK intelligence gathering

Snowden fled to Russia after a brief spell in Hong Kong during which he was expected to seek asylum in a South American state.

But
 Mr Baer said he suspected the stopover in the Far East had been part of
 a deliberate ploy to muddy the waters. ‘Why did he not get a plane to 
South America in the first place? None of it stands up. It looks like a 
recruitment operation.’

Speaking
 earlier on BBC Radio 4, Mr Baer said he believed Snowden should go to 
jail for a long time, because letting such a high-profile whistleblower 
go free would set a dangerous precedent.  

‘If
 you take that attitude with any whistleblower you’d have a really bad 
problem,’ he said. ‘Could it lead to another catastrophe? I’d say yes.

‘That’s
 a treasure trove that the Russians could use for years and years. 
They’re going to know all the parameters about our intercepts and GCHQ’s
 as well.’

Mr Baer also derided Snowden’s claims in an NBC interview that he was a bona fide spy as ‘silly’.

‘I
 think we all know by now he was a systems administrator,’ he said. 
‘When he worked in Geneva, he was a communicator – that means he sits in
 an office and relays messages back to Langley. That’s not a spy.

‘And
 secondly the NSA doesn’t have spies overseas. It’s got technicians who 
sit in American embassies and sort of listen to scanners. So I worry 
about his common sense here. He has a Walter Mitty complex it seems to 
me.’

Mr Baer said Snowden’s
 actions would cost Western intelligence agencies billions of dollars as
 they are forced to rebuild their communications systems.
