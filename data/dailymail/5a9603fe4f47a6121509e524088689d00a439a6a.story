Former England paceman Darren Gough has reportedly moved out of his family home over a friendship with Towie star Amy Childs, who he met while filming the Winter Olympics-themed reality show The Jump.

Childs, 20 years younger than Gough, 43, denied an alleged affair insisting the pair become 'good friends' on the show shot in Austria in January.

Gough, who took 229 wickets in his 58 Tests for England, is said to have left the property he shares with wife Anna near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

The cricketer confirmed in a statement through his management that he had separated from his wife.

Close: Darren Gough and Amy Childs became 'good friends' while filming Channel 4 show The Jump in Austria and on Wednesday the cricketer confirmed he has split from his wife Anna

Home: Amy Childs entered her house in Essex with a friend on Wednesday but didn't make a comment

Moved: Gough has reportedly left the family home he shared with wife Anna and their two sons in Milton Keynes

'In response to the stories in today's (Wednesday's) press I can confirm that I am no 
longer in a relationship with Anna. However, we remain close friends and
 committed parents to our children. We will not be making any further 
comments on this and politely ask that you please respect our family's 
privacy at this time,' the statement said.

A spokesman for Childs said: 'Amy and Darren met while filming for The Jump, they
became good friends during filming and remain so, they have never been involved
in a relationship'.

A friend of Childs told MailOnline they 'became close' and had a 'great time together' but have not seen each other since returning from Austria.

'Amy thought he was charismatic and charming, and they got on really well, but he is not her type. He is 20 years older than her,' the friend said.

'She is really upset to be labelled with this because they are not in a relationship and they haven't seen each other since they got back'.

Nobody answered at Gough's family home on Wednesday and no cars were parked on its grand pebble drive.

The detached house is walled off from the road with tall wooden gates, and sits on a picturesque country road. 

On The Jump Gough and Childs were knocked out of the competition in quick succession, with Childs eliminated on January 27 and Gough making a similar exit the following day.

Denial: A spokesman for Childs said on Wednesday that her client and the cricketer were not in a relationship

They have maintained regular contact via Twitter following their brief appearance on the Channel 4 show – and a pal of the former TOWIE star admits they 'got close' on the snowy slopes of Innsbruck. 

Stepping out: Childs admits she and Gough became close on the show

‘Amy denies they have slept together but admits there are feelings there,' a friend told The Sun's Dan Wooton.

‘She’s not the sort of girl to sleep with a married man. She didn’t cross that line. They were flirting and would hug on nights out. But she thinks it’s unfair that she’s being blamed for any issues in Darren’s relationship.’

Miss Childs is being comforted by her mother at her Essex house today.

The star spent some of the morning at her Brentwood salon before returning home.

Wearing a yellow tunic and her red shoulder-length hair loose, she ran out of a people carrier and straight into the house with a friend.

Shortly afterwards her mother, who lives on the same street, arrived in a black Audi.

Her white Range Rover - with the plate ‘Well Jell’ after her TOWIE catchphrase - is parked outside and the home is gated with a coded entrance.

A show insider claims Darren and Amy’s friendship blossomed shortly after they arrived in Austria to film the show.

‘The cast went on a huge booze bender on their second night in Innsbruck and Amy and Darren were being really flirty,’ a source told The Sun. 

‘The more they drank, the more obvious it was that they fancied each other. They were being very affectionate.’

MailOnline have contacted Mr Gough's agent for further comment.

The cricketer’s reported separation from wife Anna - with whom he is a parent to sons Liam and Brennan - comes five years after they reconciled following a divorce in 2002 after eight years of marriage. 

After they split he said: 'The divorce was good for me. It made me grow up. I have changed a lot since then. When I was younger I thought that playing cricket, taking wickets and making money was all there was to life. I was wrong. There's more than that, but sometimes you don't find that out until it's too late'.

Meanwhile, Amy has been single following her split from personal trainer David Peters in May 2013.

The Towie star and her 27-year-old partner were together for a year but had reportedly been arguing since Amy's ex Kirk Norcross publicly declared his undying love for the red-headed beautician last April.

The final straw came when David discovered that Amy was still in touch with Kirk - with the pair frequently sending each other text messages.
