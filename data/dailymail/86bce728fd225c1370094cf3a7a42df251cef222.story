A Samung advert has gone viral after the actors it features were deemed 'the world's worst' by online critics.

The video, which was leaked on to YouTube, has faced criticism with thousands of people claiming the the men and woman featured desperately fail to convince the viewer of their excitement about the promoted piece of computer hardware.

The three-minute long film which praises the technology company's 840 EVO Series Solid State drive has been taken down from various user accounts.

The actress failed to convince viewers of her excitement and was also criticised for delivering lines which promote sexist stereotypes

One of the actors claim the video was never intended to be seen outside South Korea where producers planned to dub over the actor's lines

In the advert actors attempt to give off the impression they are delighted with the new piece of equipment after being quizzed on their computer's pros and cons.

Among the wooden performances is a less-than-convincing account of a housewife who uses her computer to 'look at pictures or videos of my children from family trips.'

After complaining that her computer takes too long to reboot she is given the new hardware to test. 

Stick to the day job: This actor failed to deliver a convincing performance looking distinctly less than enthusiastic the whole way through the three minute long video

The actor feigned surprise when the product appeared on screen

'Aw, I did it, did you see that?' she says after successfully attaching the equipment to her laptop.

Two male actors are also featured but deliver equally unconvincing performances.

One half-heartedly asks: 'Wow, this is the SSD right?' while the other proclaims: 'It's so thin and light!'.

A thread on social news and entertainment website, Reddit, has offered unimpressed viewers a platform to discuss their thoughts on the video, under the title: 'Samsung ad featuring possibly the world's worst actors.'

Really?: This actor perhaps went over the top in his portrayal of a businessman who's fed up of his computer slowing down

This actor's flailing attempt to promote the piece of hardware does little to entice viewers

Comments include one from a person who claims to have taken part in the video, acting out the role of one of the businessmen.

Under his username, Damienf1, he said the advert was never intended to be released in America, and only be viewed in South Korea. 

Written by non-native English speakers, he said the technology giant instructed him and the other two actors to speak deliberately slowly so their words could be 'dubbed over in Korean'

Insisting he could 'do a better job', the commenter said he was merely following the director's instructions.

Samsung has not responded since video emerged.

Other critics claim however the video's flaws stem further than poor acting, and that the script used is out-dated and sexist.

'Why did they make the woman so much dumber than the men?' one user commented.

'When I'm not helping my children with homework or looking at pictures of them, I leave the computer on while doing housework! I didn't realize they had computers in 1950,' said another.
