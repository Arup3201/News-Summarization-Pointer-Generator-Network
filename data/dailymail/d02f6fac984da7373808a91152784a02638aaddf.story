Melbourne and Sydney have been named in the top four best cities to live in as a student.

Quacquarelli Symonds' World University Rankings granted the cities the impressive accolade based on their living standards, affordability, employer activity, desirability and existing student mix.

The study saw Melbourne ranked second on the list, with Sydney coming in as the fourth most student friendly city in the world.

 Australian cities made it into the top 50 this year - Melbourne 2, Sydney 4, Canberra 21, Brisbane 23, Adelaide 29, and Perth 38.

Paris was ranked first on the list for the third year running, while London came in third, dropping down from second last year. 

To be included in the study, the cities needed to have a population of over 250,000, and have two institutions ranked in the the QS World University Rankings. 

The highest rated cities are viewed as the best places for employers to find prospective workers.

Ben Sowter, head of research at QS, told The Guardian that the study ‘provides students with a complementary tool to university rankings. After all, a university experience is intrinsically influenced by the location.”

It comes after Australia scored eight schools in the Times Higher Education top 200 rankings last month, with seven of them improving their standing from the previous year.
