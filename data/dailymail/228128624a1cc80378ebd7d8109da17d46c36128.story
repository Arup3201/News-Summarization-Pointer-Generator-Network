Fifty years after she was saved from drowning, a Long Island woman is keen to again meet her savior face-to-face.

Eady Rothstein, now in her 50s, was only five years old when she slipped into a pool in Lido Beach, Long Island when 21-year-old lifeguard Larry Brickman jumped in to save her.

Mr Brickman, who now lives in Florida, administered CPR to Ms Rothstein for several minutes until she regained consciousness.

Daring rescue: Eady Rothstein, now in her 50s, was only five years old when she slipped into a pool in Lido Beach, Long Island

Ms Rothstein, who now lives in Ramsey, New Jersey, told NBC New York that she would like to give Mr Brickman a proper thank you for saving her life all those years ago.

In 1964, Mr Brickman was studying medicine and living in Long Beach for the summer so he could earn money to pay for his schooling.

He told the station that many life guards weren’t trained in resuscitation in the 1960s, so it was fateful that he had studied it in school.

‘If no one was there to do this, I’m afraid she would have succumbed,’ he told NBC New York from his office in Boca Raton.

In the news: The Long Island woman decided to get back in touch after coming across a news clipping from the time

Ms Brickman was inspired to re-connect with her rescuer after perusing through family albums and seeing a news clipping with the story of the rescue.

She searched for the doctor’s name in Google and found a listing for his practice. When she called, she got the answering machine, so she left a message.

Dr Brickman called her back and the two chatted on the phone. 

He told her that they got very lucky.

The station reports that the unlikely duo is planning an in-person reunion down the road. 

Ms Brickman is grateful for the opportunity to have reconnected and said: ‘I owe him my life, and it’s a very nice feeling to finally be able to say “thank you.”’
