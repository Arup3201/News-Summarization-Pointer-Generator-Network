Her claim to fame is having Australia's biggest fake boobs but this chest-obsessed woman wants to ignore medical advice and go under the knife again.

Sarah Marie Summer from Sydney has already had three boob jobs taking her from an 8A to an enormous 8M.

But the 23-year-old hasn't ruled out going even bigger after her assets have earned her multiple modeling jobs and a huge following on social media.

Sarah Marie Summer, 23, has already had three boob jobs taking her from an 8A to an enormous 8M  

'I don't think people believe that this is actually how I want to look,' Sarah Marie told Woman's Day.

'I want to look silly and I want to be huge.

'They make people smile and that makes me happy, so that can't be a bad thing.'

Ms Summer underwent her first boob job in New Zealand when she was just 17.

Ms Summer underwent her first boob job in New Zealand when she was just 17 to increase from size 8A to a 10C

It cost $13,000 and took her to a size 10C but the model wasn't 100 percent satisfied and started saving for her next procedure. 

In July last year, Ms Summer had her second breast augmentation and went up to a 10DD.

'I had mixed feelings after because they were still not what I had imagined. They were just not big enough so I decided to go again,' she said.

The breast enlargements give her severe back pain and impact on daily life, but the 23-year-old says she has never been happier

While Ms Summer had trouble trying to find a surgeon who was prepared to carry out her third procedure due to health concerns, she went under the knife in January.

It was one of the largest augmentations options available and left her with a whopping size 8M.

'The skin stretched so much I had blisters and they got infected. I was on antibiotics and I was allergic to them. I was really sick. I wasn't healing and they wanted to take them out but thankfully I turned a corner,' she said.

But even though the breast enlargements give her severe back pain and impact on daily life, Ms Summer maintains she's the happiest she has ever been.

'Driving is hard. I had to learn how to dance again and I often knock things over with them, or knock my drinks and spill it all over them,' Ms Summer said.
