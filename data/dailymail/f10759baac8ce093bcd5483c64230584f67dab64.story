Sickening abuse at an illegal Florida slaughterhouse where where screaming animals were shot, stabbed, gutted, beaten with hammers and boiled alive has been captured on video.

Described as the worst instance of animal abuse in the history of the United States, the horrifying treatment was exposed by in an undercover operation conducted by the welfare group Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) in conjunction with the Miami-Dade police.

The investigation led to a raid and the arrest of the slaughterhouse's chief, Raul Fernandez, 53, a local drug dealer known by the name 'Freaky' on Monday on seven felony counts of animal cruelty.

In the disturbing video, staff at the slaughter house are seen drinking beer and laughing hysterically as they torture the dying animals.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Shot but not killed: The ARM investigation captured footage of a slaughterhouse worker shooting a boar before dragging the animal 150 feet with a hook while it was still alive

Torture: The pig was squealing after it was shot and dragged more than 150 by a hook through its jaw

Beating: The cameraman watched as a worker beat a pig with a hammer before stabbing it and throwing it in boiling water while still alive

ARM sent a cameraman undercover to Fernandez's rural farm armed with a video camera in December of 2013, the height of the Christmas season, when demand for whole pigs for roasting is at its highest.

The undercover cameraman posed as a customer who wanted to buy a whole pig.

'Itâ€™s monstrous. These operators are savages with no sense of humanity,' said ARM founder Richard Couto to the Miami Herald.

'On video surveillance, pigs can be seen being dragged, hook-mouthed through the jaw, at distances of approximately 150 feet, all while the animals remain alive,' according to an arrest warrant for Fernandez first obtained by the Miami Herald newspaper.

ARM operatives said they documented children as young as 8-years old being forced to witness the alleged acts upon the animals.

Hundreds of animals including pigs, sheep and goats were allegedly sold, according to ARM.

The video also shows the moment the undercover cameraman agrees to buy a boar, at which point one of the slaughterhouse workers shoots the animal with a 'small-caliber' rifle.

The boar, however, didn't die.

After shooting the animal, the slaughterhouse worker puts a large hook through the animals jaw and drags it roughly 150 feet as it thrashed and squealed.

In another instance, a slaughterhouse employee is seen bashing a pig in the head with a hammer, stabbing the animal and then throwing it into a vat of boiling water while it was still alive and squealing. The employee then used a shovel to hold the pig under the boiling water

'No legitimate slaughterhouse operator or any self-respecting farmer would treat his livestock in such a ghastly manner,' Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said in a statement.

Fernandez, the alleged operator of the slaughterhouse is currently on probation following a conviction for marijuana trafficking.

This is not the first local operation led by ARM that has led to arrests.

In November, slaughterhouse owner Rudesino 'Rudy' Acosta pleaded guilty and took 10 years of probation after Couto secretly filmed the slaughter of animals in 2011.

Couto revealed that the slaughter of the animals witnessed in this instance was so inhumane that four of his undercover operators quit after the probe.

In recent years, authorities have made arrests for illegally butchering and selling the meat of horses, pigs and chickens.
