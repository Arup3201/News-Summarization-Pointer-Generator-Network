Mobile phones have become an integral part of going to a gig, with instagram, Facebook and other services overloaded with gig pictures, while waving phones about has become the modern equivalent of holding a candle aloft.

However, US musician Dan Deacon has taken things one step further, and created an app which becomes part of the show.

The musician, currently on tour in the US, can remotely control the phone screen, changing its colour and background in time to the music.

The musician asks users to download the free app before going along to a show.

'When I first started performing “Take a Deep Breath” (a piece of chamber music where the audience are the performers and given written out instructions as notation) a few years ago I included several uses of cell phone interaction for the audience,' he said.

'The results really pleased me and also seemed to really engage the audience.

'I thought more and more about how we are living in a time where much of the concert going audience has smart phones, that are basically computers, that can be used as both sound making machines and lighting devices.

'The thought of an audience being the light and the sound source for a show became one of my main goals.'

However, the team struggled to make the idea work, as most music venues do not have wifi networks.

Instead, they decided to use audio.

'Keith Lea, the main programmer, had the genius idea to use audio to communicate to the phones and create 'calibration tones' that would unlock the apps inner working and make it possible for us to communicate from the stage with all the apps running in the audience.

The free app syncs all the smartphones in the room to create a light show, in a similar way to Coldplay’s LED wristbands.

The handset can also be programmed to 'play along' to the music.

Audio tones 'hidden' in the music control the smartphone screens, display colours and creating patterns.
