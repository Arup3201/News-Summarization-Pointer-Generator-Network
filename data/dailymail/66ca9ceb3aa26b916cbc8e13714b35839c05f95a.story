Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim was today named the world's richest man for the fourth year in a row as the annual Forbes magazine list was released.

This year also marks the first time that Warren Buffett has dropped out of the top three in more than a decade.

The list showed that poverty-stricken Nepal had gained its first ever billionaire, entrepreneur Binod Chaudhary, while in the UK the fortune of JCB mogul Anthony Bamford more than doubled to £2.8billion.

Other British billionaires to make a splash on this year's edition of the list include larger-than-life businessmen such as Richard Branson, Philip Green and Bernie Ecclestone.

citizens of the UK, with the Duke of Westminster leading the British 
pack in 89th place with a fortune of $11.4billion (£7.6billion).

Tory
Burch made her first formal appearance on the list as she has $1billion
to her name following her ex-husband Chris Burch's sale of part of her

the list include entrepreneurs Richard Branson and James Dyson, Formula 
One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, press barons Richard Desmond and the

Lakshmi Mittal in 41st place, Richard Murdoch at 91 and Roman Abramovich
in number 107.

Though the top spots remain occupied by some familiar faces, the list did undergo some major geographic and demographic changes this year.

There are 210 new billionaires from 42 countries, including 27 from the United States.

Sixty people have dropped off the list and eight have died.
