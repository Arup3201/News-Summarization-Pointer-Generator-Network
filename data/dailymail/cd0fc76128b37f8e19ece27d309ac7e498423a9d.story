A healthy three-year-old boy died from meningitis four hours after being rushed to hospital just days after his younger brother was given the all-clear from the disease.

Shae Button was rushed to the same hospital where eight-monght-old Harvey had been treated for suspected meningitis five days earlier.

But despite frantic efforts to save him, Shae tragically succumbed to Meningitis B, meningococcal sceptecimia four hours later.

His devastated mother Connie, 21, said: 'What happened to us feels like a cruel joke.

Shae Button died of meningitis just four hours after being rushed to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after his mother Connie Button noticed he had developed a purple rash on his arm

Shae, three, fell ill just five days after his baby brother Harvey (pictured left with Shae) was given the all-clear by doctors, after being rushed to hospital by his mother Connie (right with Shae) with suspected meningitis

'I thought I was going to lose my youngest son yet it turned out I would lose the other one instead.

'I felt so happy when doctors told me Harvey was OK and obviously had no idea what was going to happen next.

'I keep thinking was there something I missed? Could I have prevented what happened to Shae?'

Harvey, who was born premature and suffered chronic lung disease, was rushed to hospital on April 8 after developing a high temperature.

His mother said she became concerned when the eight-month-old lost all interest in his food.

She left Shae with his grandparents and took Harvey to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where he was given blood tests, and was kept in for observations for 12 hours before doctors gave him the all-clear.

Ms Button, from Cwmbran in Wales, said she was overcome with relief as doctors revealed Harvey was fine.

'I had all these images in my head of Harvey in the hospital on drips fighting for his life and I thought, "Thank god we all don't have to go through this".'

But five days later, on April 13, Shae began to feel unwell.

By 6am the next morning the three-year-old had developed a tell-tale purple rash on his arms.

He was rushed by ambulance to the Royal Gwent Hospital and diagnosed with meningitis immediately.

Shae's mother Connie, said: 'When I was told he had passed away, everything was like a blur. I thought he would pull through. I had prepared myself for a long haul at hospital but didn't expect not to have him'

Connie Button has raised more than £10,000 for the charity Meningitis Now, in memory of three-year-old Shae

His mother 
said: 'One minute doctors would tell me he was stabilised the next they 
rallying around him and they were trying to revive him.

'When
 I was told he had passed away, everything was like a blur. I thought he would pull through. I 
had prepared myself for a long haul at hospital but didn't expect not to 
have him.'

She
 added: 'Shae had been absolutely fine and was a healthy boy.

'He was always so energetic and full of pop, only had a cold a few times and had always been a bubbly little boy. I just 
can’t understand it.

'The shock still hasn’t sunk in, how can he be alive and playing with his toys one moment and dead the next?'

'If I can help at least one family in Shae's name, I will be happy. My son has died but he could end up helping save the lives of hundreds of other children'

- Shae's mother Connie Button

She said she is heartbroken that Harvey will grow up never having known his older brother.

Ms Button has set up a fund in Shae's memory, raising more than £10,000 for the charity Meningitis Now, in her son's memory to help beat the disease that claimed his life.

'People need to realise that meningitis can affect anyone no matter how healthy you are,' she said.

'If I can help at least one family in Shae’s name I will be happy. My son has died but he could end up helping save the lives of hundreds of other children.

'With Shae there were no warning signs, he wasn’t ill in the days leading up to his death and he wasn’t acting odd or different.

'I think parents need to be more aware when it comes to meningitis. It could save more lives and no one would have to go through what I am having to live with every day.

'There is nothing worse than losing a child and I would not want any mother, or family, or parent, to go through what I have been through, it is absolutely horrendous.

'Things will never be the same again. I don’t think I will ever get over it.'

The Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland.

This means that every day nine people become ill with the disease. 

With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day.

A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. 

Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms.

So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia.

Septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis. Not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any order.
