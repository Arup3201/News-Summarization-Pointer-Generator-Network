Savaged: Anthony Schofield and his injured cat Jessie. Both were attacked by a fox that invaded their home in Catford, south east London

A couple have told how they were attacked by a crazed fox in their own home as they fought to rescue their pet cat from its jaws.

Anthony Schofield, 49, suffered a fractured wrist and two inch-wide bite wounds while his girlfriend Tammy Chapple, 36, had her finger badly bitten.

The ‘mangy’ animal managed to sneak into their home in Catford, south east London.

It surprised Mr Schofield by appearing in the bathroom.

He tried to chase it out of the house but the fox then escaped to the living room, where it started to attack his 14-year-old rescue cat Jessie.

Mr Schofield said: ‘I was in the bathroom and I saw what I thought was our dog nudge the door open in front of me.

‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw this mangy little fox.’

The animal then darted into the  living room, where it sank its teeth into their cat’s face.

‘It went for Jessie ferociously. She tried to escape by clambering up the curtain but the fox was clawing at her and bit through her jaw,’ he said.

‘I hate to think what would have happened if she had been a baby.’

Mr Schofield, who is a carpenter, tried to pull the fox away from his pet but it clamped its jaws around his wrist instead.

He added: ‘The fox was madly swinging around from my wrist, trying to scramble for the cat.

‘It was wild and incredibly strong. I am not a weak man but I could not for the life of me manage to open its jaw on my wrist.’

When it finally let go, the animal attacked trainee teacher Miss Chapple as she tried to pull the cat to safety.

Mr Schofield ended up dragging it to the garden where it made its escape.

The fox's bite was so powerful it fractured Mr Schofield's wrist

Their dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier called Clementine, missed her chance to save the day as she was locked in the kitchen at the time.

Following the ordeal, which Mr Schofield described as a ‘living nightmare, they were forced to go to hospital to seek medical assistance.

Their cat Jessie, who suffered facial injuries, is now too scared to go into the living room.

Yesterday the couple insisted more action needs to be taken to tackle the problem of urban foxes.

The incident follows a spate of attacks on pets and children over the last few years.

Nine-month-old twins Lola and  Isabella Koupparis were mauled in their cot by a fox in Hackney, east  London, in 2010 – leaving them both with horrific injuries.

And in February, four-week-old Denny Dolan suffered hand and facial injuries when a fox dragged him from his cot in Bromley, south east London.

In response, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he was considering a cull of urban foxes but admitted implementing it would be ‘difficult’.

A survey on urban foxes for Channel 4 last year found that 36 per cent of city-dwellers admit to feeding them in their gardens.

Wildlife experts have warned that today’s resourceful urban fox will take advantage of any open window or catflap when desperate for food.

They say householders should take precautionary steps to secure their home against the animals.
