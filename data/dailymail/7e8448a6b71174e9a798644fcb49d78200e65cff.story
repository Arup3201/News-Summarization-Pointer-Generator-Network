London Fashion Week isn't only a catwalk for designers to parade the season's latest looks, it is also a catwalk for Europe's top fashionistas, stylists and celebrities to dress to impress.

And it isn't just the catwalk looks that can provide fashion inspiration. Take a stroll around the grounds of Somerset House and you will notice that cute and quirky animal ear accessories have emerged, as well as the slightly bolder and more eccentric head gear – perhaps in honour of milliner Philip Treacy’s return to the catwalk.

Decadent brocade ensembles have been worn in all their glory, paired with peep toe shoe boots or flatform wedges. FEMAIL takes a look at some of the hottest trends emerging from London Fashion Week...

Pixie Lott donned the cute animal ears on the front row of London Fashion Week, a trend that seems to be catching

The latest look could well be a nod to Philip Treacy's show, of which Lady Gaga was a huge fan

 

Rich and detailed brocade fabric in coloured silks was a hot trend off the catwalk this season

Sun hats were the perfect accessory this season for the sunny days hanging around at Somerset House

Colourful and cosy headwear was the order of the day for some fashionistas

 

A firm favourite on the fashion pack’s well pedicured feet, peep-toe boots are fast becoming a hot topic

Great for being snapped on front row in, these boots add edge to everything from dresses to city shorts

 

Neon colours are what's hot this season and this fluffy knit is the perfect way of wrapping up warm and looking great

Every fashionista knows that florals are back with a bang this seasons, here paired with an edgy jacket to tone them down

Pastel colours are hot right now and city shorts teamed with a matching jacket are a great smart but chic combination

Laura Whitmore was looking as stunning as ever as she hung around Somerset House in a full length cream dress with over-sized clutch
