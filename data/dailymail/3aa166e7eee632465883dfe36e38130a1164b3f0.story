Whether she's working out at a SoulCycle class in LA, sipping a green juice or showcasing her toned body modelling her lingerie range, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has made no secret of her passion for health and fitness.

But the supermodel has revealed that she only 'works out like crazy' so she can eat what she wants, citing 'eating good food' as one of her favourite pastimes. 

She told MailOnline: 'I’m a great believer in not denying yourself when it comes to what you eat and drink but, like everything in life, it’s about finding a healthy and happy balance.'

What's her secret? Supermodel and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who dazzles in the new Coca Cola Life campaign, reveals that she works out so she can enjoy good food with her friends

The 27-year-old, who dazzles in a Marc Jacobs gown in  Coca Cola Life's new campaign, also shared her secrets to a happy and healthy life - and proves she's still a down-to-earth girl from Devon despite her glittering career.

'To me, life is about enjoying the special moments that make us happy, however big or small,' she said.

Never mind all the Hollywood parties she gets to attend; the lingerie model reveals that her happiest moments are 'listening to good music, dancing, sharing a good joke, skiing, swimming and eating good food.' 

If it's good enough for Rosie! The 27-year-old, who follows a strict healthy regime, said that Coca-Cola Life lets her enjoy the great taste she loves but with a third less sugar and a third fewer calories

While she does swear by all things clean and lean, she allows herself sweet treats too. 

'I work out like crazy so I can enjoy good food. I'm travelling all the time so it's hard to find a balance and eat healthily. I really love my food - I'm always being tempted by room service and I eat out a lot - but I try and eat organic with natural ingredients,' she said.

'At home I cook as clean and healthy as possible, so when I'm out I can enjoy a pudding or a glass of wine and actually enjoy myself.' 

The Devon-born model, who is dating Hollywood heartthrob Jason Statham, says that having a good sense of humour is very important to her and that her superpower would be being able to snap her fingers and be wherever she wants to be.

The active supermodel says that her ultimate life moment was when she learnt to ski recently because it was one of the best holidays she has ever had as she loved being outdoors and doing something fun with friends.

She also revealed her favourite way to stay fit - dance classes where she can channel Beyonce.

The Devon-born model said: 'I love dance classes! I love Body by Simone - I go with my girlfriends, we all go and sweat our faces off and then have a healthy breakfast.

'You have to make it fun. I like to go to dance classes and feel like Beyoncé,' she said, adding that one of her favourite songs to work out to is Summer by Calvin Harris.

The fitness fanatic also works out with James Duigan, the man behind the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire.

Rosie met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as flat as James can!'  

Business woman: Rosie has been keeping herself busy with her M&S, Paige Denim and Coca Cola campaigns - and she's also been filming movies
