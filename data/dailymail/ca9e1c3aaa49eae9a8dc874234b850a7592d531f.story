Former Cleveland police chief Sean Price was being sued to £500,000 the force claimed he was wrongly paid - he will now repay just £23,000

A police force which was suing its former chief constable for £500,000 has settled out of court for less than 5% of the figure, it has emerged.

Cleveland Police were trying to claw back salary and bonuses it believed Sean Price was wrongly paid across a number of years before he was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012.

The civil case was due to be heard next month but Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Barry Coppinger has now said Mr Price's offer of £23,000 has been accepted.

The force has already spent about £30,000 on external barristers' fees - £7,000 more than what Mr Price will pay.

Mr Price was the first chief constable in 35 years to be sacked after an inquiry found he lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter.

The settlement in the case was due to mounting legal costs during a time of budget pressures and Mr Price's ability to pay any more, Mr Coppinger said.

In a document on the PCC's website, he wrote that the case against Mr Price was based on the legal argument that the payments were originally made 'by mistake of law'.

He accepted the £23,000 offer was a 'modest proportion' of what had been hoped for, but said it was made in good faith, with reference to Mr Price's ability to pay.

Mr Price, a father of two, has allowed the force to see financial documents, the PCC said.

Mr Coppinger said: 'I concluded that I faced a choice either to accept the sum which Mr Price had demonstrated he could afford or proceed to court, risking an estimated overall six-figure sum in court costs which was unlikely to be realistically recoverable.'

He added that other PCCs and forces had considered similar civil claims before deciding not to proceed.

Mr Coppinger said the payments Mr Price received were investigated under the wide-ranging Operation Sacristy inquiry into alleged corruption, but did not result in criminal charges.

He said: 'Although ending the claim will mean that the court will not have the opportunity to address the legal questions, taking all of the considerations in the round I have determined that it would be appropriate to conclude the matter on the basis of the payment of the sum offered.'

Mr Price became the first chief constable in 35 years to be sacked after an inquiry found he lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter

Mr Price said in a statement: 'This was a difficult decision for me as I had a strong case that the payments were lawful and should not be repaid 10 years later.

'However, the case has cost me several thousand pounds already and the public a great deal more. The only people benefiting have been lawyers.

'I made the decision that the best course of action was to settle now to prevent the costs escalating further.

'Notwithstanding our differences, I would like to pass my best to all at Cleveland Police in dealing with the financial challenges facing the force in the future.'

A civil court hearing had been told Mr Price received a £50,000 retention package and an £24,000 bonus for cutting crime during his time as chief constable.

When he took the top job in 2003, his salary of £125,000 included a £32,000 car allowance, £4,000 a year towards private school fees fir his son and £1,000 towards private health insurance.

By the time he was suspended in 2011, his total pay was £200,000. 

The current Police and Crime Commissioner for Cleveland  said the decision was taken after considering how much Mr Price could afford to pay and the legal costs of contesting the case

Ron Hogg will not face prosecution over bonus payments paid while he was at Cleveland Police

A police and crime commissioner has been told he will not be prosecuted over bonuses and a car he received when he was a senior officer at a neighbouring force.

Ron Hogg, Durham police and crime commissioner, was subject of an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into his time at Cleveland Police where he was deputy chief constable.

Last week the IPCC said it was passing on its findings to the Crown Prosecution Service, which considered whether a charge of misconduct in a public office was appropriate.

The CPS has announced there was 'insufficient evidence to show any crime has been committed'.

Mr Hogg was deputy chief at Cleveland when he retired in 2008 and had received two bonus payments, the CPS said.

There was no evidence he had asked for them, but he was recommended for them by the then chief constable Sean Price who assessed his performance as very good.

Mr Hogg, who was elected to the post of PCC in 2012 after a long career in policing, said: 'This matter should never have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service.

'I am pleased at the announcement but disappointed it should have got this far. I am not surprised that I have been completely exonerated, there was no case to answer.

'The IPCC should not have been spending valuable taxpayers resources on something like this.'
