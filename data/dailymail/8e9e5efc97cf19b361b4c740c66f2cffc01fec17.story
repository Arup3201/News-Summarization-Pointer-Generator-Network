Prime Minister's Questions is famously an occasion where some MPs get carried away.

But in the final session before the summer recess, one Tory member appeared to get more animated than most.

MP Anne Marie Morris launched into a furiously-tribal tirade today after asking a question on education.

The Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris caused a stir with her screaming rally of support at PMQs today

Despite having one arm in a sling, the Conservative MP for Newton Abbot refused to hold back

And despite having one of her arms in a sling - which she was wearing after damaging tendons in her shoulder - she appeared barely able to contain her excitement.

Speaking during a typically noisy House of Commons session, the MP said: 'This government has a great record on education reform.

The Prime Minister praised his backbencher for her 'feisty' form during the last PMQs before recess

The Prime Minister turned to thank his backbencher for her animated showing during PMQs

'Given the huge success of the university technical college initiative created over 25 (sic), will the Prime Minister please confirm he will support a further round of applications this autumn and that funding is available so that businesses, universities, parents and young people in Devon...'

It is not known if the round of jeers which eventually drowned out the Tory MP's question caused her outburst, or were in response to it, but either way it was not long before Morris could no longer be heard.

Speaker John Bercow appeared bemused by the incident, saying: 'We got the gist of it.'

The Prime Minister, who has been 
criticized himself previously for getting carried away in PMQs thanked 
his backbencher for her enthusiasm.

In an animated PMQs - the last before the summer recess in Parliament - Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, claimed that the Prime Minister, right, was losing the confidence of his party and the country

He said: 'It's very good to see the honourable lady on such feisty form.

'She's absolutely right to speak up for university technology colleges.

'They are a great addition to the schools we have in our country.'

In an animated PMQs showing, the Prime Minister also brushed aside reports that he was involved in an angry confrontation with the ringleader of Tory rebels on House of Lords reform as 'tittle tattle and rumour'.

Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed David Cameron was losing the confidence of his party and the country following last night's record Tory rebellion.

David Cameron was said to have approached Conservative backbencher Jesse Norman outside the House of Commons division lobbies following last night’s revolt by 91 Tory MPs.

Labour MP Karl Turner wrote on Twitter that he saw a 'very angry' Mr Cameron make a beeline for Mr Norman and then start 'pointing his finger in his face'.

Challenged by Ed Miliband about the incident at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron dismissed the claims as 'half-baked gossip'.

Mr Miliband said: 'Last night he lost control of his party and, not for the first time, he lost his temper as well.'

Mr Cameron retorted: 'If we want to see House of Lords reform, all of those who support House of Lords need to not only vote for House of Lords reform but support the means to bring that reform about.'

The Government was forced to withdraw its timetable for the House of Lords Reform Bill to avoid a possible defeat with Tory rebels threatening to join forces with Mr Miliband’s party.

The Bill did gain a second reading, with Labour backing, but 91 Tories rebelled including two MPs who sacrificed roles as ministerial aides to vote against the whip.

Mr Miliband told the Tories: 'Last night he lost control of your party and, not for the first time, he lost his temper as well.'

The Labour leader said 'we understand it was fisticuffs in the lobby' with Jesse Norman, a prominent rebel over Lords reform.

'I notice that the posh boys have ordered him off the estate today because he doesn’t seem to be here,' Mr Miliband said.

He asked who was to blame for the 'disarray' in the Government - the Liberal Democrats who pushed for Lords reform or the Tory rebels.

Mr Cameron replied: 'Oh dear. If the best he can do today is a bunch of tittle tattle and rumour, how utterly pathetic.

'On the day we’re introducing social care reform that’s going to help people up and down the country and we get this sort of half-baked gossip.'
