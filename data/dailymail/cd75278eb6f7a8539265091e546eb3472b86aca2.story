Charges: Fergus Shanahan, executive editor and former deputy editor of The Sun, will face magistrates following allegations of corruption and illegal payments to public officials

An executive at The Sun, who was a deputy to Rebekah Brooks when she was editor, is be charged over alleged payments of £7,000 to a public official, it was revealed today.

Fergus Shanahan, 56, is accused of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office between August 2006 and August 2007.

The Crown Prosecution Service said today he will appear before Westminster Magistrates on May 8.

Scotland Yard officers from its corruption probe, Operation Elveden, have been investigating him.

Former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were told last month that they will face trial in September next year over alleged illegal payments to public officials.

Prosecutors believe Mr Shanahan, who was deputy editor from 2003 to 2009 when Ms Brooks was editor, allowed a journalist to make two payments totalling £7,000 to a public official in 2006 and 2007.

The 56-year-old is The Sun's Executive Editor and leader writer, crafting the comment pieces that appear under paper's name every day.

He was previously night editor and worked on the 'back bench' in production, having started out on the Reading Evening News.

The announcement was made by Alison Levitt, QC, who oversees CPS decision making and all potential prosecutions in relation to the ongoing phone hacking investigations and other related matters.

'Following a careful review of the evidence, we have concluded that Fergus Shanahan, who served as an Editor at the Sun newspaper, should be charged with an offence of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office,' she said.

'It is alleged that in August 2006 and 
August 2007 Mr Shanahan, in his role as an editor, authorised one of his
journalists to make two payments totalling £7,000 to a public official 
for the disclosure of information.'

A fortnight ago the crime editor of The Sun was told he would face no further action after he was arrested as part of Scotland Yard's investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

Mike Sullivan, 49, was held under Operation Elveden on January 28 last year.

The journalist, who was arrested at the same time as three other current and former journalists from the tabloid, welcomed the decision.

He said: 'I feel sadness that colleagues are still in the same predicament over the last 14 months, but hopefully they will find a successful resolution.'

Ongoing cases involve four former police officers, six journalists and two other public officials.

Former deputy editor of The Sun, Geoff Webster, 53, was last month charged with paying out a total of £8,000 to public officials in exchange for leaked information.

The official in the first charge cannot be identified for legal reasons, and the second was unidentified but is understood to have been either a member of the Armed Forces or a Ministry of Defence employee.

Elveden originated as part of Operation Weeting, which was set up in 2011 to investigate allegations of phone-hacking at the News of the World.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
