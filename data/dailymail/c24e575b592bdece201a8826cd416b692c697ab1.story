Wigan prop Ben Flower has been hit with a six-month ban for his vicious attack on St Helens’ Lance Hohaia in Saturday’s Grand Final.

Flower, who was also fined £300, was said to be ‘devastated’ when he left RFL headquarters following his hearing in Leeds.

The ban is a Super League record for a single offence and he will miss 13 matches — 10 league fixtures, the World Club Series clash with Brisbane Broncos and two pre-season trial games. Hohaia, 31, accepted a one-match ban for his role.

Flower, 26 will be eligible to play 11 days after Wigan and Saints are due to meet in their traditional Good Friday fixture in April.

He was sent off after two minutes for retaliating to a forearm in the face from Hohaia by felling the Kiwi international with a right hook and then punching his opponent again as he lay motionless on the Old Trafford turf.

A statement read: ‘The tribunal panel accepted that Flower had been provoked by a challenge from his opponent but took the view that his actions were malicious, intentional and had the potential for serious injury.’

There is no suggestion that Flower’s future at Wigan is under threat. He stood solemnly alongside Wigan’s football manager Kris Radlinski, who read out a club statement after the hearing.

‘Wigan Warriors would like to go on record as saying that the Rugby Football League disciplinary commission handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity.

'We fully support their assessment of Saturday night’s incident involving our player Ben Flower. We will be making no appeal.

‘We would like to apologise to Lance Hohaia and his family and to the St Helens club and fans. St Helens’ win on Saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong.

‘The Grand Final was an incredible game and St Helens were worthy winners. We hope our respect and healthy rivalry can remain intact and that both clubs can return to Old Trafford in the near future and showcase properly the exciting spectacle that rugby league is.

‘Ben has issued an apology and is full of remorse for his actions. We will work hard to repair any damage caused to the reputation of rugby league.’

Saints chairman Eamonn McManus called on the sport to rally round Flower. ‘His rehabilitation is now paramount,’ he said.

‘During the period of his ban he will be no more than a 26-year-old boy who will be extremely vulnerable emotionally.

‘We must assist him in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one.’
