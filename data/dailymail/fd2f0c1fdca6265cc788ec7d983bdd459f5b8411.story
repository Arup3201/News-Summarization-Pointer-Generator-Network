Controversy: The drug has recently been legalised in parts of the U.S.

Mental illnesses are triggered six years earlier in patients who have smoked high-strength cannabis every day, a study has claimed.

Mental health patients who smoked skunk daily - which has a high amount of the drug's active ingredient, THC - had their first psychotic episode at an average age of 25, compared to 31 for non-users.

Yet the damage was not limited to heavy smokers or those using powerful cannabis, according to the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London.

Mental health patients with a general history of using cannabis still had their first psychotic episodes at 28 - three years earlier than those who never tried the drug.

And those who smoked the drug before they were 15 put themselves more at risk, with their first symptoms at the age of 27 instead of 29.

Dr Marti Di Forti, who led the study, wrote: 'Daily use, especially of high-potency cannabis, drives the earlier onset of psychosis in cannabis users.'

The study was of 410 people aged 16 to 65 who were admitted to south London hospitals with their first psychotic episode.

Scientists asked the patients about their history of using tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and other illicit drugs.

Those who smoked skunk cannabis - four times more powerful than hash, according to seizures by police in south east London cited in the study - were at the greatest risk, they said.

Psychosis means a loss
 of reality and is associated with several psychiatric diseases, 
including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Risk: Mental health patients who smoked skunk cannabis daily developed symptoms six years earlier

Dr Di Forti said: 'This is not a study about the 
association between cannabis and psychosis, but about the association 
between specific patterns of cannabis use... and an earlier onset of 
psychotic disorders.'

The report said age was critical because the teenage years and early twenties were when people developed professionally and educationally.

Potent: A bag of prepared skunk. Skunk is a generic word for more powerful strains of cannabis

The study also found men were more likely to use cannabis than women, and also had psychotic episodes earlier - though both genders were at risk from smoking the drug.

It focused only on people who already had mental illnesses. It did not try to establish whether cannabis causes psychosis on its own.

Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, said that was still a key question to answer.

'The thorny question is whether they 
might otherwise have developed the disease or would have not had mental 
illness,' he said. 'It's a distinction we haven't figured out yet.'

Skunk is a word used to describe about 100 strains of cannabis which have higher levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient, than other varieties. It was originally created by cross-breeding plants.

The study was revealed in the latest issue of Schizophrenia Bulletin and follows the legalising of the drug in some parts of the U.S.

Colorado has suffered a shortage of the drug just a week after it was legalised.

The political battleground is still dogged by conflicting evidence. One study from the Netherlands found that people prone to mental illness may smoke cannabis to 'self-medicate', which could be why scientists keep finding a link.Â
