When Slaven Bilic returns to England to continue his managerial career, he won't be adopting an English approach.

That's because, according to the Croat, it no longer exists.

'There’s no more English game. It’s become so cosmopolitan,' he said ahead of Thursday night's Europa League clash against Tottenham here in Istanbul.

'How can you talk about the English style of play when you have 20 non-British players in the 22? 

'For example, I played for West Ham in 1997, we are losing to Chelsea, we had no striker because Tony Cottee was injured and Iain Dowie was injured. 'They had Zola, Vialli, we are losing 1-0, but we turn the game and we’re winning 2-1 with two minutes to go, we’re desperate for the points but Chelsea are better than us.

'Ludek Miklosko goes to take the free kick. I try to waste some time, so then I go to take it, then I tell him: "No, you take it". 'We waste some time, we try to waste 30 seconds and then, our crowd, they go mad and are shouting: "Come on, any chance?!" 'I’m thinking: "Do you want us to stay in the Premier League?" Then it goes 2-2 and we score again 3-2, that’s it.

'That's what was good in England. I’d like to keep that in England. 'But big clubs in England, defending for the last 15 minutes, the fans are saying: "We are playing well, we are solid." 'In England, that was the last resort back then. 

Bilic pleads his case with the referee after receiving a red card during Everton's 2-0 loss to Chelsea in 1997 

'Now, Spain is about more open play, more attractive, over England.' His comments maybe surprise a few given he's perhaps one of the most 'English' foreigners in Premier League history.

His rip-roaring, 'up and at 'em style' endeared him to Hammers fans during his time at Upton Park.

But while Bilic says English football is changing - he is adamant it's changing for the better.

Despite England's poor showing in last summer's World Cup, Bilic claims he saw a spark in Roy Hodgson's team that many others didn't spot.

'England? They are doing well,' said Bilic.

Despite England's poor showing at the World Cup in Brazil (above), Bilic saw signs of improvement 

'Maybe in the major championships (they are not doing so well) but in the qualifiers they are doing well. 'They beat Switzerland away – a tough game for anybody.

'I watched England in the World Cup because I was writing for the Croatian papers on England. For me, I saw something in England against Italy and Uruguay that I have not seen for a long time. 'I saw energy, I saw flair, I saw passion, I saw quality up front. England had unbelievable luck those two games. But Hodgson was slaughtered.

'In 2014, I saw more energy than in 2012, 2010 or 2006, although England got past the group stages.' Could the re-introduction of a foreign manager help England progress further in competitions? 'If a foreign manager takes over England and he sees games out at the end, then you say this is not England’s game,' explained Bilic.

'I don’t think that was a problem. They were just individual mistakes. I know if England come home after a week it is a disappointment but it is not that black and white.' 

Bilic, currently in charge of Turkish side Besiktas, comes up against Tottenham on Thursday night.

A victory over Mauricio Pochettino's side will only serve to bolster his already burgeoning reputation as one of Europe's best emerging managers.

And he admits returning to England appeals to him.

Bilic said: 'Will I manage in the Premier League? It’s a question I get asked, not only about England. 'I like it here, I like this job, it’s a massive club. And I'm enjoying it big time. 'But of course, I would say that one day I would be interested in England, of course I would.

Bilic's name was considered in the summer as West Ham contemplated replacing Sam Allardyce 

'I am not that humble or modest to say I am not a good enough coach, but I am very realistic, I am not in their league of coaches. 'If there is anyone in that league, that says I am going to go there and then there… to get a job you have to do well. 'Then your colleagues have to do bad, get sacked. And then the club has to say we want him.

'But all you can do is do well. If I can draw my career, I would rather go to England.' Perhaps, his next stop will be West Ham.

His stock is high among the powers that be at Upton Park - his name was even considered in the summer as they contemplated replacing Sam Allardyce.

Bilic refused to comment on speculation the Hammers sounded him out in the summer, before insisting the east London club is already in great hands under Sam Allardyce.

Tottenham go through their paces on the Ataturk Olympic Stadium turf ahead of their clash with Besiktas 

'I hope they can stay there (in the top four). There is a long way to go. But you can’t talk about early days today. There are enough games,' Bilic added.

'They are doing well and Southampton. I think one of them can make it. Especially because they are improving a lot.

'West Ham were struggling last year, but they were very good in the transfer market, bought good players and kept good players last year. And it clicked. 'Big Sam knows the league like this, from Bolton and Blackburn. He was under pressure. But he got used to pressure.

'He never doubts himself, because he has done it in past. It is a big advantage if you feel something like that. You have been there.'
