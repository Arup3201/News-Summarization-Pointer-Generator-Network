A Los Angeles man who has been jailed for a crime he didn't commit since April 27 has finally been released from prison.

Authorities released Gerber Guzman from LA County Jail where he's been held since his arrest on drug dealing charges.

Guzman's wife, Yanira Hernadez, says this is the second time her husband has been wrongly imprisoned since his identity was stolen six years ago.

Innocent: Gerber Guzman has been imprisoned for a total of one month for crimes he never committed

The first jail stint Guzman endured lasted 16 days before his name was cleared with the help of U.S. Marshals, reports CBS Los Angeles.

Injustice: Gerber Guzman was finally released to be with his heavily pregnant wife and their two children after his ordeal

Hernandez says that the first time her 
husband was released, U.S. marshals realized that the fingerprints they 
had on file for Gerber Guzman did not match those of her husband.

This time, the DEA told her it was the U.S. Marshals who were holding her husband.

'They
 cannot let him go, because the U.S. Marshals are the ones that have the
 hold,' Hernandez said. 'It’s really hard when you have kids, and you 
have one on the way, and your kids ask you twenty-four/seven, "Where’s 
daddy?"'

Last month, Guzman was pulled over for an expired car registration and taken into custody when the police officer realized there was a warrant outstanding for his arrest.

He was in prison for 12 days before he was released.

Now, Guzman and Hernandez want to know how the same error could have occurred twice.

'The
 thing is that they know it’s not him, but they still have him in there,
 and that’s what’s heartbreaking,' Hernandez, who is eight months 
pregnant, told CBS.

'They told us it wasn’t going to happen again, and fast-forward six years later, it happened again.'

Hernandez says she tried to get her husband released to no avail, and in desperation contacted CBS with her story.

Stolen identity: Gerber Guzman's identity was stolen six years ago, and since then he's twice been arrested on drugs charges that he is innocent of, says his wife Yanira Hernandez

The DEA confirmed Wednesday to the station that they were aware of Hernandez's claims.

'DEA is aware of claims that the man in custody is not the same person for whom the arrest warrant was issued. DEA takes all allegations of this nature seriously and is currently using ever resource at our disposal to address the matter,' read a statement released by the DEA.

Guzman was released from prison Thursday night.
