With the eyes of the world on Britain, there was mounting anger last night over cynical attempts by union leaders to bring chaos to our borders and transport networks.

As thousands of athletes and officials pour into the country on the eve of the Olympics, immigration and customs staff are tomorrow due to walk out at Heathrow Airport – a move which the Government could take court action to stop.

And from Friday, workers on London Underground, some of whom have already secured Olympic-linked bonuses of up to £1,000, will start a work-to-rule regime.

Similarly, staff on key suburban rail routes to Games sites in London and Weymouth will also begin disruptive action.

The moves come as a shocking new analysis reveals the number of working days lost to strikes is escalating dramatically.

In 2011, 1,388,000 days were casualties of industrial action – a three-fold increase on the 456,000 in 2009, Labour’s last full year in power. It was the highest figure since 1990, when 1,903,000 days were lost.

This morning, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Radio 4's Today programme that he was 'very confident' in contingency plans for Thursday's planned strike by border agency staff.

'We need 550 people to maintain a full immigration desk policy at Heathrow which means we can get people through in the shortest possible time and we have 584 shifts now confirmed for Thursday, despite the strike', he told interviewer James Naughtie.

He said fears Heathrow would grind to a halt because of the extra passengers attending the Games had so far failed to materialise, and he commended the situation at the hub airport as 'a tremendous success'.

On the planned strike, he said: 'For an immigration officer - and I'm sure the vast majority of immigration officers feel this way - Thursday is one of the biggest days in their professional career.

'It is the day when the eyes of the world will be upon them and the welcome we are giving to the rest of the world.

"The vast majority of them will want to do a really good job and show what they are capable of.'

Last night Conservative MP Dominic Raab said there was growing concern that public sector workers were being called out on the basis of tiny turnouts in strike votes.

He said there was a clear case to require unions to secure the support of 50 per cent of balloted members to make industrial action legal.

Ministers are now considering taking court action over Public and Commercial Services Union leader Mark Serwotka’s decision to call a 24-hour strike by Heathrow staff.

Seven out of eight of members of the PCS did not vote to take industrial action in a ballot of Home Office staff.

Mr Hunt told Today that Mr Serwotka 'must be losing confidence that what he's doing represents the majority of his members' after the union leader turned down the BBC's invitation to appear on this morning's programme.

The possibility of an injunction to block the strike came following a letter to the union from Home Secretary Theresa May, describing the planned walkout as ‘opportunist and wholly unjustified’.

And Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has told colleagues other senior figures in the union movement had privately expressed dismay that the PCS was targeting the Olympic transport rush.

Mr Raab said: ‘Mark Serwotka’s vindictive action is the latest in a wave of reckless strikes, led by a few militants who want to sabotage the economy and humiliate the nation.

‘Too often it is those union bosses shouting the loudest who have the least support from their own members. It is welcome that ministers are looking at reform. But, if the government is going to pick this fight, it must win it decisively.’

The strike action was also condemned by Mr Hunt, who said: ‘Any decision to strike during the Olympics is highly regrettable.’

He insisted contingency plans were in place, but added: ‘There will be slightly longer queues than in recent weeks.’

Yesterday union leaders announced London Underground employees are to stage a ‘work-to-rule’ from Friday in an Olympics-related dispute.

The Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which represents thousands of Tube staff, said it was in dispute over implementing an Olympics pay deal as well as the use of casual workers.

The union has already secured Olympics bonuses of up to £1,000 for drivers, with other members of staff in line for up to £850 for the ‘massive additional pressures’ they will face during the Games.

The RMT’s South West Trains members will refuse to do any overtime or work on a ‘rest day’ from Friday until August 12.

South West Trains operates many of 
the key train lines out of London’s Waterloo, such as trains to Eton for
 the rowing, Weymouth for the sailing and Wimbledon for the tennis.

Workers
 insist they are furious they are not getting a bonus for working during
 the Games. South West Trains, owned by Stagecoach, dismissed this 
claim, insisting workers were given an inflation-busting pay rise of 
4.75 per cent just a few months ago.

PCS officials were due to hold talks with senior Home Office officials last night over planned border strike. Military police, Whitehall officials and retired border staff are on standby to prevent chaos at the borders if the strike goes ahead.

The PCS said: ‘The problem over the past 18 months has been that there has not been the political will in the Home Office to reach a solution.’

RMT secretary Bob Crow said: ‘While the likes of Jeremy Hunt, and the rest of the Government, are sitting in the well-padded VIP seats in the Olympics Stadium as a nice little bonus, our cleaners on the Tube and DLR, who work round the clock in appalling conditions, are being treated like dirt.’

Howard Collins, London Underground’s chief operating officer, said: ‘We reached agreement with all four unions at the end of May on how we can fairly reward our staff and operate services during the London 2012 Games.

The fact that four-fifths of those balloted chose not to vote or voted no to industrial action shows that we have the support of our staff.’
