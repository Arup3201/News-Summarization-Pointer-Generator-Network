When security officials stopped two 17-year-old girls on suspicion of stealing from a Victoria's Secret store in Manhattan, they found something much more sinister in their bags.

The two girls were stopped leaving the Victoria's Secret store on Broadway near Sixth Avenue in Manhattan's Midtown around 1:30 when a security guard caught them stealing undergarments.

But when they looked in the bag they made a gruesome discovery.

Security guards found a dead fetus in a black shopping bag of a suspected shoplifter stopped leaving a Victoria's Secret in Manhattan today

At the bottom of a black shopping bag, the security guards found a dead male fetus swaddled in some clothes.

One of the girls claimed to have given birth to the baby the day before.

That girl, a Brooklyn resident, was taken to Bellevue hospital for treatment.

The other teen was taken to the police precinct station house for questioning, sources told the New York Daily News.

Charges for both women are pending.

The investigation is ongoing and the city's Medical Examiner is set to conduct an autopsy to see how the boy died.Â
