The British tourist who nearly died when a rogue taxi cab drove onto a Manhattan sidewalk and severed her foot appear on the Dr Oz show Tuesday for their first reunion since her horrific ordeal.

Sian Green, 24, was walking with a friend near Oz's production offices August 20 when a cab driver lost control and ran her over. Among those who rushed to her aid was television personality Dr Oz, who brought Green in to do a taping of his show just a day after she was discharged from the hospital.

Meeting Green for the first time will be David Justino, the heroic plumber who used his belt as a tourniquet to staunch the bleeding, thus saving Green’s life.

Reunited: Taped just a day after her release from the hospital, British tourist Sian Green appeared on the stage of Dr. Oz, who helped save her life when she was struck by a rogue cab in New York City August 20

Staying positive: The remarkably upbeat Green is reunited in the episode, which airs Tuesday, with Dr. Oz and meets the plumber David Justino (right) who saved her by using his belt as a tourniquet

Green speaks at length to Dr Oz about how losing her leg, which had to be amputated, has changed her life and about her plans for the future.

Remarkably, the beautiful young woman has retained an upbeat attitude despite her loss and has even used the accident to help improve her outlook on life.

'You can¿t take anything for granted': Green's foot was severed by the taxi and her leg eventually amputated. But she has managed to keep a positive attitude

‘I’m so young and I have so much to look forward to,’ she explains to Dr. Oz, whose assistance was vital during Green’s ordeal.

Green was seeing the sites of New York City in August with her friend Keshia Warren when cab driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon of Queens, New York, 24 lost control and slammed into Green.

The driver, who has received seven traffic violations in the last three years, had reportedly just been in an argument with a cyclist when tragedy struck. Charges have not been brought against Himon.

Regardless, Green likely doesn’t hold a grudge.

‘I can’t be down in the dumps because I have so much to look forward to,’ she says.

Green, who once hoped to become a model, says she’s not always at 100 percent, but she does what she can.

‘I get them days where I’m just a bit not as happy, not as smiley,’ she tells Dr. Oz. ‘I still do smile, but I’m 24 years old and this happened to me with my bestest friend, walking, enjoying life.’

She’s now just taking life as it comes.

‘You can’t take anything for granted because it can be gone like that,’ she said.

Hero: Green said if it wasn't for the actions of strangers who rushed to help she wouldn't have survived the accident. David Justino (right) used a belt to make a tourniquet for her leg, while celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left) also raced to the scene

Investigation: No charges have yet been filed against the taxi driver in the incident, who reportedly lost control of car after an argument with a cyclist and ploughed into Miss Green

She told the New York Post it felt 'fantastic' to be discharged and will not let the horrific incident destroy her dreams. The pretty brunette hopes to model again and launch her own clothing line.

'This won’t stop me from doing that,' she said.

The crash happened on the second day of her trip to the city and she did not get to do the things she wanted.

'The only thing I really wanted to do was go to the top of the Empire State Building,' she said in a Tuesday appearance on Today. 'I wanted to go shopping, meet up with a few friends, do the typical New York things.'

Aspirations: Sian Green hoped to become a model and was training to be a buyer for Hugo Boss

Passersby rushed to help Miss Green immediately after the incident. David Justino used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg while a pizza truck owner raced to put her foot on ice.

Her appearance on Dr Oz marks her first meeting with Justino, who visited Green once at the hospital but could only meet her family.

The two share an embrace and emotions run high through the first meeting.

‘I just, I, I, the appreciation and I just, oh, thank you,’ says Green.

‘You're welcome. You're so welcome,’ replied the humble Justino. ‘You don't have to say thank you. I  happened. I tried, I wasn't even thinking. I didn't even think. I just saw you there and the only thing I had was my belt and that's what I needed.’
