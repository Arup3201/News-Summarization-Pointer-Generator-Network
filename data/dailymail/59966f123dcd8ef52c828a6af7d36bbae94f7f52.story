The search for the remaining bodies from tragic AirAsia flight QZ8501 has officially ended.

Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's rescue agency, confirmed that the ships involved in the search were pulled out on Wednesday.

AirAsia lost contact with flight QZ 8501 on December 28 as it was flying from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board. The search effort has recovered 106 bodies, with 56 still missing.

The families of those missing will now have to try and go on with their lives, but the chance of them finding closure looks gone forever.

Frangky Chandra, the older brother of Gani Chandra, an Indonesian man who was on board the plane, and whose body has not been found, told the BBC it was difficult for his family to move on.

‘We will never stop waiting,’ Mr Chandra said.

He said 'the most important thing' was that DV1, the official search team, has said it will help with the identification process if any more bodies are found.

Tony Fernandes, the CEO of AirAsia, told reporters last week that to 'get more than 50 per cent (of the bodies) is considered a huge success’.  

He said the airline was giving it 'one last shot' at recovering those still missing. But he added that the search could not ‘go on indefinitely’.

A total of 56 bodies still remain missing since the plane crashed into the Java Sea en route from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, on December 28, killing all 162 people on board.  

'It is our responsibly to look after those families as best as we can,' Mr Fernandes said last week. 

He said he was in 'constant dialogue' with the families of those still missing, and that 'contingencies' would be put in place should not all the bodies be located.

'QZ8051 was probably the worst moment of my life and it continues to be something that will haunt me forever,' he said.

Mr Fernandes would not be drawn on why the preliminary official report into the crash was not being made public.

Indonesian investigators earlier this year submitted the report into the plane crash to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, keeping its contents secret.

Mr Fernandes said it was 'not right for him to say whether they should have or whether they shouldn't have' publicised the report, adding there must have been a 'valid reason' for the decision.

He also defended AirAsia's safety record. 

'All I can say is that we're regulated by lots and lots of authorities and no one has banned us from coming to their country,' he said. 

Mr Fernandes supports the move for better aircraft tracking technology

Mr Fernandes also said he supported better aircraft tracking technology amid the ongoing mystery about the whereabouts of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. 

'I can't see why data can't be sent to the cloud every five minutes for instance,' he said.

'It's ridiculous in this day and age that you can find your iPhone but we can't find an aircraft.'
