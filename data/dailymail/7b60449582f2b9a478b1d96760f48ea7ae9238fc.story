The christening service of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, Prince George, will take place at 3pm next Wednesday, Kensington Palace confirmed today.

The baptism will be held in The Chapel Royal at St James's Palace and will last 45 minutes. It will, as previously revealed, be conducted by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.

One of the reasons for a late afternoon 
ceremony is that the Queen is holding a reception at Buckingham Palace 
earlier in the day for the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.

Christening: Prince George was born on July 22 and is third in line to the throne

But royal aides say no further details about godparents and other guests or the order of service will be given out until the day.

Last week the Mail revealed that senior members of the Royal Family including the Countess of Wessex and Princess Anne have been left off the guest list. It is highly unlikely that Prince William's uncles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, will attend either.

In a break with Royal tradition, the couple have chosen to hold an 'intimate' ceremony at the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace - where the body of Diana, Princess of Wales, lay before the altar for a week before her burial in 1997 so her family could pay their last respects.

The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was looking forward to welcoming Prince George into the 'family of the church' in a statement released two weeks ago

The couple chose the venue over the Music Room at Buckingham Palace - where Prince William, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne were all baptised - and the private chapel of the royal residence, where the Queen herself was christened.

It is understood that William and Kate favoured the Holbein-decorated 
Chapel Royal because it is, in the words of one royal aide, 'an 
historic, quite intimate chapel.'

'It is something they have been thinking about for some time and they just very much liked personally,' they said.

The
couple have long made clear they aren’t sticklers for royal convention:
whether it be William ripping up the suggested 700-strong guest for his
wedding because he 'hardly knew anyone on it' or their decision to 
release a family snapshot of George taken by Kate’s father, Michael 
Middleton, instead of a formal portrait following his birth on July 22.

And the couple have other personal links to St James's Palace, where until recently their Household was based.

And
in April 2011, Kate chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the 
Church of England before her marriage to Prince William.

The last official royal christening to take place at St James's Palace was that of Princess Beatrice in December 1988.

It
is likely that the Prince George will be christened in a replica 
Honiton lace gown of that worn by Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in 
1841.

The original intricate
lace and satin christening robe was specially crafted for Victoria, the
Princess Royal, and used by generation after generation of royal 
infants including William himself.

Prince Edward's daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, was the last royal baby to wear the delicate ensemble in 2004.

The Queen then commissioned an identical handmade copy so the 172-year historic outfit could be carefully preserved.

It was made by the Queen's dresser Angela Kelly and her team of dressmakers at Buckingham Palace.

The
Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will attend Wednesday's christening along 
with the Prince of Wales, a grandfather for the first time, and the 
Duchess of Cornwall.

Kate's 
family - parents Carole and Michael Middleton – will also be invited 
along with the godparents, about whom royal aides have promised more details on the day of the christening.

In
line with royal tradition, George is likely to have six god-parents and
among the names in the frame are William's best friend Thomas Van 
Straubenzee, his former private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and 
ex-nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

Several of Kate's friends are also in the running, along with her sister, Pippa, and brother James.

The
christening will also allow a truly historic family photo to be taken –
and released to the public - no doubt delighting the 87-year-old Queen.

For the first time in more
than a century, three heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, 
64, Prince William, 31 and new-born George.

The
last occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria 
was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great 
grandson Edward VIII.

The 
existence of a Chapel Royal itself dates back many centuries and, 
originally, was not a building but an establishment: a body of priests 
and singers to serve the spiritual needs of the Sovereign.

During
Tudor times the Chapel would follow the Sovereign around the country to
whichever Palace or great house was in favour at the time.

Since Whitehall Palace burned down in the late 17th century the Chapel Royal has been based exclusively at St James's Palace.

The building was originally constructed by Henry VIII and decorated 
by Hans Holbein in honour of the king's fourth marriage to Anne of 
Cleves.

Mary I's heart is 
buried beneath the choir-stalls and it was where Elizabeth I said her 
prayers for the defence of the realm against the threat of the Spanish 
Armada in 1588.

At the end 
of the Civil War, Charles I also received the Sacrament of Holy 
Communion in the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace before his execution
in Whitehall in 1649.

Three special coins will be made to mark the Prince George's christening, the Royal Mint has announced.

A
gold kilo coin, a silver £5 coin and a 'more affordable' £5 coin have 
been approved by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen and the 
Chancellor.

Birthday money: This £5 coin was previously issued by the Royal Mint to mark the birth of the Royal baby

This will be the first time that new coins have been produced in the UK to mark the christening of a member of the Royal Family.

Details of the prices and how many will be created have yet to be announced.

Shane
Bissett, of The Royal Mint, said: 'The Royal Mint has celebrated 
moments of national significance for over 1,000 years and it was felt 
appropriate to produce the first-ever set of Royal christening coins to 
mark the christening of our future king.

'As
a British institution, The Royal Mint has played a central role 
creating works of art as official commemorations of landmarks in the 
history of the Royal Family for hundreds of years. These coins will be a
fitting addition to that long tradition.'

A
£5 silver proof coin has already been issued to mark the birth of the 
future heir to the throne and other commonwealth countries including 
Canada and New Zealand have also issued coins to commemorate the birth.

The £5 Royal Birth coin was priced at £80 from the Royal Mint, and is currently sold out.

Queen
Victoria was married in the Chapel, and her marriage certificate, 
hand-written by the Archbishop of Canterbury and signed by both bride 
and groom, still hangs on the wall in the vestry.

It is also considered to be the cradle of English church music. Among its many noted organists and composers was Henry Purcell.

One
of the Chapel's most notable organists and composers was George 
Frederick Handel, who was appointed by George II in 1723 as 'Composer of
Musick of His Majesty's Chappel Royal'.

The
title was constructed to allow Handel, still a German citizen, to 
contribute to the musical development of the Chapel Royal without 
actually being a member of it.

Though
Prince George is the first member of the royal family to be christened 
in the Chapel Royal for 25 years, it has been the backdrop for many 
royal milestones since its construction in the 16th century. 

Built
by Henry VIII following his short-lived fourth marriage to Anne of 
Cleves, the chapel at St James's Palace is the believed burial site of Mary I's 
heart.

It is where 
Elizabeth I chose to remain during the Spanish Armada in 1588 to pray, 
receiving updates of the conflict's progress via fire beacon from 
Cornwall.

The Chapel Royal at St James's Palace has been the scene of many royal milestones since its construction under the order of Henry VIII in 1540

Queen
Victoria married Prince Albert at the Chapel Royal in 1840 underneath 
its decorated ceiling which is painted with royal initials and coats of 
arms.

Her marriage 
certificate, handwritten by the Archbishop of Canterbury and signed both
by the bride and groom still hangs in the Chapel's vestry.

In 
1997, the coffin of Diana, Princess of Wales lay before the chapel's altar ahead of her funeral in Westminster Abbey.

At
the end of the Civil War, Charles I received the Sacrament of Holy 
Communion within the chapel's walls before his execution in Whitehall in
1649.

Various changes were 
made to the building in 1836 with the addition of side galleries and a 
new ceiling to match the original 1540 ciphers. 

The
Chapel Royal also has a long musical history with many
noted organists and composers having performed there.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married in the Chapel Royal in 1840. Their marriage certificate still hangs in the chapel's vestry

Among
the most well known are Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons 
and Henry Purcell who lived in a suite of apartments within the Palace. 

It is believed the 
poet, John Dryden, who was frequently in debt, used to take refuge with 
Purcell in his apartments in order to avoid the clutches of persistent 
creditors.

One of the 
Chapel's most notable organists and composers was George Frederick 
Handel, who was appointed by George II as 'Composer of Musick of His 
Majesty's Chappel Royal' in 1723.

The
title was constructed to allow Handel, still a German citizen, to 
contribute to the musical development of the Chapel Royal without 
actually being a member of it.

Handel composed the great anthem 'Zadok the Priest' for the coronation of George II in 1727.

The
song has been used at every coronation since. and is also sung at the 
Royal Maundy service in which the Queen distributes Maundy money to elderly members of the church on the day before Good Friday.

The
nearby Queen's Chapel was built by 
James I for the Catholic bride of his son, later Charles I, and designed
by Inigo Jones.
