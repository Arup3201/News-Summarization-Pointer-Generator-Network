Shivering in the cold before dawn yesterday, more than 30 patients queue in the desperate hope of seeing a doctor.

The scene, a bleak picture of a health service in crisis, is one repeated daily in many parts of the country.

The patients lined up from 6.30am because it was their only hope of a same-day appointment with their GP at a heavily oversubscribed practice. The Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey is one of the biggest in Britain.

Bleak: The patients lined up from 6.30am because it was their only hope of a same-day appointment with their GP at a heavily oversubscribed practice. The Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey is one of the biggest in Britain

Originally designed for 6,000 patients, it now serves nearly 19,000. Residents say the extra demand is a result of new housing developments springing up while few improvements have been made to health services. 

The surgery has 12 GPs, four of them recruited in the past two years to cope with increased demand, and hopes to recruit more. As its roll has increased, so has the NHS money flowing in – surgeries are paid £73.56 per patient, according to GP magazine Pulse.

But patients at Sunbury Health Centre say the phone is continuously engaged so it is ‘impossible’ to ring for an appointment. If they do manage to book by phone, they face a wait of up to two weeks to see a doctor.

The surgery is open weekdays from 7am until 6pm and like many across the country does not offer appointments in the evenings or at weekends – Labour’s 2004 changes to GP contracts allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours.

Patients say the only option is to queue in the hope of seeing a doctor on the same day. Those queuing yesterday would otherwise not be seen until well into the new year.

Retired nurse Sue Levi, 63, was trying to get an appointment for her five-month-old grandson Ethan. She said: ‘I’m queuing for my grandchild who is ill with bronchiolitis. You can’t bring a sick baby to queue in the cold at 7am. The nearest surgeries other than this are miles away.’

Charlotte Cox, 36, an HR manager, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s the third time I’ve been down here in the past week. The first time I didn’t manage to get an appointment, the second time I did but I had to stand in the rain and then again today. It’s not right.’

Tina Zander, 50, a secretary, said: ‘What if you are elderly and living on your own? You can’t expect them to come and queue. The surgery can’t take any more. It’s disgusting.’

Chauffeur Mark Carr, 54, tried to book an appointment by phone but was told the earliest date was January 5. He said: ‘I had no choice but to come down here. I’ve been here since 7am queuing. It’s ridiculous.’

The scene is not unique as GP surgeries across the country are being stretched to breaking point. In September the Mail reported NHS figures predicting that this year 58.9million GP appointments will have entailed a wait of a week or more – a rise of almost 50 per cent on 2012.

And the queue in Sunbury may continue to grow unless something is done – the surgery expects a further 4,000 patients will sign up in the next three years. The practice has been lobbying for a new premises or money to redevelop the existing surgery.

It said in its newsletter that it was trying to recruit more staff and doing its best to deliver ‘excellent primary care’.

Kwasi Kwarteng, Tory MP for the Spelthorne constituency which includes Sunbury, said: ‘We have been trying to work this out with NHS England and we have not got as far as I would like. It’s bursting at the seams and it can’t continue much longer.’

A spokesman for Sunbury Health Centre said there had been an increase in patients seeking appointments before the Christmas holidays. It added: ‘We are currently reviewing our system. Although there may be a queue on certain mornings, all patients who require an appointment will be seen or telephoned by a GP the same day.’

NHS England said: ‘We are aware of the challenges faced by Sunbury Health Centre and we are working closely with the practice to support them.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs in many parts of the country.’

Some patients are bypassing GP surgeries to go to A&E, putting huge pressure on the emergency services. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted taking his children to A&E over a weekend because he didn’t want to wait for a GP appointment.

A Conservative health spokesman said: ‘Eighty-five per cent of patients say they can get access to a GP quickly, but we know services are under pressure – that’s why a future Conservative government would guarantee seven-day access for everyone by 2020.’
