A GP has been cleared of groping a patient's breast after a tribunal found the woman's evidence was unreliable.

The 42-year-old woman claimed Dr Abhijit Banerjee locked the consultation room door and asked her to remove her bra while she sat on the couch.

Known only as Patient A, she claimed that the senior partner at the Abbeyview Surgery, in Peterborough, Cambs, had knelt on the floor while he cupped and squeezed her breast as he breathed 'erratically'.

The General Medical Council accused the married father-of-two of 'sexually motivated conduct' but the GP was vindicated when the fitness to practise found Patient A's evidence to be unreliable.

Patient A, had a history of chest problems and had consulted Dr Banerjee for a 'thorough' chest examination presenting with an ongoing cough, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told.

The 42-year-old doctor had admitted to not providing a screen to protect the patient's privacy during consultation on March 13, 2012, but the panel found this did not amount to misconduct.

Despite undergoing more than 60 similar appointments because of her particular medical history she told the Manchester hearing this time it 'just felt wrong' at the hands of Dr Banerjee.

Giving evidence, she said: 'It was an examination like I had never had before. I felt very upset.

'The position of me sitting on the couch with the doctor on his knees, and I could only see the top of his head, while holding my breast, just felt wrong,' she added.

'He was not squeezing continuously. He held my breast in a manner where he was covering my breast.

'It felt uncomfortable to be held covering the nipple area especially.'

The hearing was told that Patient A reported the incident after discussing what had happened with a friend at 'the Bingo' later that day, but did not make an official complaint until two months later.

The Indian-trained medic, who qualified in Calcutta in 1996, denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of the woman throughout the hearing.

He said the examination was justified and that it his usual practice to kneel down during a breast check if the patient is sat on the low chair in his consultation room.

Patient A claimed Dr Banerjee locked the consulting room door At Abbeyview Surgery in Peterborough, before asking her to remove her bra while he examined her chest. Her evidence was found to be unreliable

The medic argued his unusual breathing
 may have been to demonstrate the long, deep breaths his patient needed 
to take while she was being examined.

Following
 an application to drop the charges, the panel, chaired by John 
Donnelly, decided that there were too many questions over the 
reliability of Patient A's evidence.

Mr
 Donnelly told the doctor: 'The panel considered that she gave what she 
believed was a truthful account of what happened during your examination
 of her chest.

'The panel however, cannot find that she is not mistaken or has not misinterpreted innocent actions by you.

'The
 panel find that there are too many question marks surrounding patient 
A's overall credibility for it to put reliance on her evidence which is 
uncorroborated.'

Dr Banerjee
 had been placed under a string of temporary conditions that have now 
been lifted and the doctor can return to unrestricted practise.
