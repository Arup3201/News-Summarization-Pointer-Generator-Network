Earlier this month, after Harry Kane scored twice against Arsenal at White Hart Lane, the Tottenham forward claimed nothing could beat a north London derby. He spoke too soon.

Against West Ham, the team any fair-minded Tottenham supporter cannot contemplate losing to, the boy-who-can-do-no-wrong scored a dramatic equaliser after 95 minutes and 54 seconds. Kane’s timing is impeccable.

Tottenham can win the Capital One Cup, at Wembley, against Chelsea, the Barclays Premier League leaders on Sunday and - seriously - you will not see celebrations like this.

The place was bedlam, with young and old hugging each other in the old stands, uncertain whether to turn to Kane as he celebrated in front of the Paxton Road or flick two fingers at the 2,868 West Ham supporters. In the end they did both. Whatever makes them happy, because this was a rank Tottenham performance as they hurtle towards a week when they must at least score and draw with Fiorentina to make progress in the Europa League. 

They were saved here by the stupidity of Alex Song, foolishly lulled into the shove on Kane in the 94th minute that predictably, had to be, a penalty. The Tottenham forward is a clever so-and-so.

‘You can see why he’s give it - Alex has put his hands on him,’ admitted West Ham’s manager Sam Allardyce.

The poor fella’s bubble has well and truly burst at Upton Park and it isn’t just because they threw away a two-goal lead at the home of their greatest rivals. He even found it hard to credit Kane.

‘It was lucky because he missed the penalty and luckily it went to him to finish it off,’ he added.

Without the perseverance of Kane, 24 goals to the good as he goes head to head with Raheem Sterling for the PFA young player of the year award, Spurs would not have rescued a point here.

They were two nil down to West Ham, thrown out of kilter by the constant, menacing presence of Mark Noble in the centre of midfield alongside Song. They pretty much won everything in there.

It was only when Noble was substituted in the 66th minute, a sensible decision before his tiring legs caught one too many Spurs players, that West Ham lost their grip on the game.

Until then he had excelled, save for his inevitable booking, and he had even set up the second goal for Allardyce’s team in the 62nd minute. Back to the beginning, though, and the moment West Ham supporters could, with some justification, sing ‘Tottenham Hotspur, it’s happening again’. The reasoning behind Mauricio Pochettino’s decision to withdraw Mousa Dembele at half-time in favour of Christian Eriksen (and Lord only knows why he did not start) lay in the midfielder’s error in the build up to Cheikhou Kouyate’s 22nd minute header. Shuffling around on the ball, idling with it on the edge of the Tottenham penalty area while you wait for a wide-eyed eastender who is foaming at the mouth is not the way to approach a game of this significance.

West Ham pinched the ball off Dembele’s toes, Aaron Cresswell steered in a cross from the left and Kouyate, predictably, caught Jan Vertonghen and Eric Dier napping. On the touchline Allardyce was in full combat mode, barking at fourth official Mike Dean over a series of innocuous decisions before West Ham took command of this game.

The guy is under pressure, with some serious decisions to be made up in the West Ham boardroom after David Sullivan was ambushed by an angry mob in the car park at the Hawthorns last week.

He looked good for the three points here, their first since January 18, when Diafra Sakho slid in the at the far post to meet Noble’s 62nd minute cross swung in from the left.

They should have seen it through, even without Noble for the last 24 minutes and the enforced substitution of the substitute Carlton Cole because he pulled up lame with a hamstring injury.

Until then, Tottenham had poked around a bit in midfield without ever looking likely to score. Kane shot tamely wide and Danny Rose headed over the crossbar in an ultimately dreadful first half performance. The second wasn’t much better, that was until Adrian punched away Erik Lamela’s cross from the right and into the path of Tottenham’s left back on the edge of the area.

Rose’s effort, partially botched and completely fortuitous, was driven into the ground and somehow beat the sightline of West Ham’s keeper in the 81st minute.

He owed his team-mates for that, brilliantly pawing away Roberto Soldado’s shot two minutes later as White Hart Lane responded to the growing sense that something special was about to happen.

When it did, deep into injury-time, Kane’s penalty was initially saved by Adrian before the Tottenham striker reacted quickest to the rebound to make it 2-2.

After a finish like that, nothing can beat it.
