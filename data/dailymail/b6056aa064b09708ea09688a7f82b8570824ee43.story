Jose Baxter is discussing his journey from being Everton’s youngest ever player to the brink of a second cup semi-final with Sheffield United when he reveals he would like to say sorry to David Moyes.

Having been handed his Premier League debut by Moyes aged 16 years and 191 days, sooner than Wayne Rooney or Ross Barkley, Baxter left Goodison Park at 20, exasperated with reserve football and team-mates who laughed after losses.

There was a contract offer from Everton but Baxter failed to put pen to paper. Two years on he has scored at Wembley, been part of a side to beat Liverpool, and made more than 100 senior appearances.

‘It was an easy decision for me really,’ he says.

'When David Moyes offered me the contract I didn’t say, “No thanks”,’ explains Baxter. ‘It had to be signed by a certain date and I just didn’t sign it.

‘Because he’d been so good to me I do regret a little bit not going in and saying, “Listen, I’m going to move on.” If I came across him now I’d definitely apologise for that.’ 

It is six seasons since Moyes sent Baxter on for the final 12 minutes of a top-flight fixture against Blackburn, then started the schoolboy a week later at West Bromwich Albion. 

‘He hugged me when I came off,’ says Baxter. ‘He’s a top fella – I haven’t got a bad word to say about him.’ 

The propensity for making bold career decisions is a trait that unites the pair. The player left Everton to gain regular first-team football lower down the leagues, initially with Oldham; the manager elected to re-start his career abroad with Real Sociedad following his chastening spell at Manchester United.

‘He’ll probably learn another language and take his family,’ says Baxter. ‘If he does come back to England there will definitely be a job for him.’

Baxter stepped into League One eager to get meaningful action after growing disillusioned with youth football. He played four senior games in 2008-09 but only nine more in the next two seasons, in competition with Marouane Fellaini. Predominantly, he stretched his legs in Under 21 matches. For Baxter, that was not a means to push on.

‘I was going into reserve games and getting beat and was gutted,’ he says. ‘I was looking round and there were other lads laughing saying, “Shall we go for food, or go out for a bit?” I don’t want to do that after losing a game of football. It just shows it means nothing to them.

‘Then I would be around the first team and one player has another by the scruff of the neck because they’ve got a draw instead of a win.

‘I played reserve football from 14 up to 19 and it just got boring. If a first-team player was injured he would come down and wouldn’t take it seriously. It just wasn’t for me.’ 

He went on loan to Tranmere Rovers for the first half of the 2011-12 campaign.

‘The loan system is brilliant – it helped me massively. There are no kids – if you’re good enough you’re old enough. And if you’re old enough you’re ready for a b*****ing.’ 

Intensity is a difficult thing to manufacture when the consequences of victory or defeat remain fairly unsubstantiated – youth football’s eternal problem perhaps. Baxter did gain a real sense of competition on international duty, captaining England Under 17s at the European Championship of 2009.

He played alongside Jack Wilshere and against Mario Gotze, who scored in a 4-0 victory for eventual champions Germany. 

‘There have definitely been a few I’ve played against who’ve kicked on,’ is Baxter’s understated appraisal on the last man to score a winning goal in a World Cup final.

‘Jack is certainly one of the best I’ve played with,’ he adds. ‘When we used to go away at 16, you didn’t really know what gym was. He would always be in there working his socks off.’ 

Hard work is a defining principle of Nigel Clough’s Sheffield United and could prove the determining factor in their ambitions of toppling Southampton in Tuesday’s Capital One Cup quarter-final.

This season’s other Premier League upstarts, West Ham, have already been upset by Clough’s side in this competition – on penalties in round two – and Baxter believes Bramall Lane in full voice can provide the setting for another scalp.

‘It’s a loving football city and they really want us to do well. It’s only what they deserve.’ 

Baxter has been scouting Southampton since the draw was made six weeks ago. 

‘You watch them closer and try to see weaknesses. There haven’t been many. For us to beat them it will be difficult but we will be going into the game to win.’ 

Ronald Koeman’s side haven’t won in five, losing their last four and Baxter cannot resist.

'When they heard they were playing us in the cup they started getting beat – whether they’re a bit nervous about Sheffield United I‘m not sure.’ 

Southampton were one of League One’s big beasts back in 2011 before earning consecutive promotions and re-establishing themselves in the Premier League. It is a progression Baxter draws inspiration from.

‘That’s where we want to be. Everyone knows Sheffield United don’t belong in this league but it is the reality. We’re doing our best to get out of it. There is no better way than to play against the big teams and see how far off you are.’ 

Sheffield United reached the FA Cup semi-final last season after knocking out two Premier League teams. Baxter scored the opening goal in a thrilling match against Hull at Wembley, eventually succumbing 5-3.

‘It makes you want to get there every year,’ he says of the occasion. It was a career highlight, alongside victory over Luis Suarez’s Liverpool in the same competition in January 2013 while at Oldham.

Despite his Everton connection, Baxter is a Liverpool fan and was at the 2005 League Cup final at the Millenium Stadium that Chelsea won 3-2. Ask for his preference between going one better with Sheffield United or going up into the Championship, he responds instantly.

‘Definitely I’d rather have promotion all day. That’s easy,’ he says. 

Baxter has a habit of making tricky choices look simple. 

One Football League fan will on Tuesday win the £250,000 SkyBet Transfer Fund for their club to spend on players in January. Watch the draw on Sky Sports News at noon.
