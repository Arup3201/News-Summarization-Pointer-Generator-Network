A year after friends Mesfin Nega and Shimelis Yegazu made a pact to switch off the other's life-support machine should either of them suffer a horrific injury, Nega was attacked outside a nightclub - and left with irrevocable damage to his spinal cord.

Now, six years after Nega woke from a coma to find he was a quadriplegic, Yegazu has fulfilled his promise - administering a lethal dose of phenobarbital to his friend before taking it himself.

Police have ruled the August 14 deaths in Columbia Heights, Washington D.C. as a murder-suicide, as one official said detectives believe the two men, both 38, carried out a suicide pact.

And friends speaking to theÂ Washington Post have revealed how Yegazu stepped up to fulfill his friend's long-desired wish to kill himself - one he was unable to achieve on his own.

Pact: Shimelis Yegazu, left, gave Mesfin Nega, a paraplegic, a lethal dose of a barbiturate before taking it himself - seeing through a promise they had made to end each others lives if they suffered an injury

Nega, who worked construction jobs and loved dancing at nightclubs, was left paralysed from the neck down after he was attacked by four men as he tried to get into a club in May 2006.

They threw him against a metal grate and punched and stomped on him on the sidewalk; police chased them and caught one,  Miguel Angel Avalos, who was sentenced to eight years in prison.

After Nega woke from an induced coma after two weeks, he was moved to a rehabilitation ward before going to live with his sister, Mamie Masfin - whom he often told he wanted to kill himself.

She said he spent his days watching movies, surfing the internet with the help of special devices and was in constant pain - but knew he could not take his life.

'How would he do it?' Mamie asked. 'He couldn't scratch his nose. You had to move his arm for him.'

She said that she had never thought Yegazu, who had a three-year-old daughter, would help him with his suicide - and added she does not know why the man also wanted to take his own life.

Left behind: Friends said they were aware the men had made a pact seven years ago, but said they did not think Yegazu would go through with it as he had a three-year-old daughter

Devoted: Yegazu, left, told friends he felt guilty when Nega, right, was left paralysed from the neck down after he was beaten up by four men outside a nightclub in Washington D.C. in May 2006

But a friend, Lydia Tabesse, said she had been with the men seven years ago when they first talked about turning off the other's ventilator if they suffered a bad injury.

'If anything were to happen to me, I hope you got my back. I hope you advocate on my side not to keep me on a machine,' she remembered Nega telling Yegazu, the Washington Post reported.

She added that Yegazu felt guilty when his friend was put on a ventilator after his accident, aware that he had made a promise to Nega.

Mamie, who acknowledged her brother's pain 'was like putting his hand in hot oil', said he would 'joke' that his relatives were selfish for keeping him alive.

'Why would you want to keep me around like this?' he would ask his family.

Tabesse said that more than a year ago, Nega said that he had come across a drug in China that would help him kill himself - but that he would need someone to administer it.

When she asked who would possibly help, he eventually admitted that Yegazu was going to.

She confronted Yegazu about the suicide and asked if he could see him killing himself, to which he responded: 'Not at this moment.'

On August 13, Yegazu flew to Washington D.C. from his home in Colorado and the two men stayed up late watching films.

When Nega's nurse returned the next day, she found the two men unresponsive. Nega had died, and Yegazu passed away five days after taking the drug, which police believe he used in pill form.

Mamie later found an email exchange between the two men which had taken place days ahead of Yegazu's visit. 'Did you get enough for two?' Yegazu had asked in his email.

The two friends, who had bonded over their love of nightclubs, were eventually buried side by side.

A medical examiner ruled that both men died from 'acute phenobarbital intoxication.' Phenobarbital is a barbiturate.
