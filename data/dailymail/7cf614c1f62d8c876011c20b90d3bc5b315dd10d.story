The man 
mauled by a great white shark this weekend at a popular southern 
California beach has finally opened up about the terrifying attack.

Steven

 Robles, 40, was bitten by the seven-foot beast around 9.30 
a.m. Saturday morning at Manhattan Beach while it was snagged on a 
fishing line, it panicked and bit the swimmer out of fear while trying 
to wriggle free.

'It
 came from the bottom of the water. It came up to the surface, it looked
 at me and attacked me right on the side of my chest,' Robles told KABC. 'That all happened within two seconds.'

'I saw the
 eyes of the shark as I was seeing it swim towards me,' he continued. 
'It lunged at my chest, and it locked into my chest.'

Robles has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

'I’m still pretty shaken up. I’m still rattled, my nerves are still shaky,' he told KCAL. 'For a second, I thought this might be it, I was absolutely terrified.'

'I never thought I would die in the ocean.'

Fishermen on the Manhattan Beach pier,
 one of whom snagged the shark, laughed at the victim just after the 
attack, footage has revealed.

The
 fishermen didn't realize Steven Robles, 40, had been bitten and laughed
 at his screams, but they quickly clammed up when it the severity of 
situation hit them.

'There he is, look at him,' yells one of the fishermen as they reel in the ocean beast. 'Look at him! Look at him!'

Grainy footage shows group of swimmers. Among them, the whipping snout and tail of a shark can briefly be made out.

In the moments that follow, the group of men and woman watching from the pier all break out into laughter at the man's expense.

'He's right at him,' says one man, as there is a renewed burst of laughter.

The group appears unaware Robles has been seriously hurt, but they know he's terrified and still laugh.

'You hear him screaming?' asks a man. 'He was right on top of him.'

But
 that's when things take a turn.

Robles' blood-curdling screams turns the laughter to 
stunned silence.

But the fisherman told the Los 
Angeles Times they were unaware they had a shark on the line at the time
 they were laughing.

'My buddy's pole takes off. He fights for 10 or 15 minutes and passes it to me,' said the man identified only as Jason.

'We spent 20 to 30 minutes not knowing what it is yet. When we catch bat rays in excess of 150 pounds, their pull and tug is similar to a great white. They're called mud marlins because of the way they fight.'

It was not until the snagged creature was 150 feet away, about 30 yards offshore and only 10 feet from Robles did they realize it was a shark, Jason claimed.

That's when the fisherman tried to pull the shark out to sea before cutting the line, likely causing it to panic and attack Robles.

'We are deeply concerned about the swimmer,' said Jason. 'No one intended this to happen.'

Police have no plans to arrest any of the fisherman, sources told the Times.

The ailing man was quickly pulled from the ocean as the fishermen yelled to other swimmers to get out of the water as quickly as possible.

He was conscious and talking to paramedics while being taken to UCLA Harbor Medical Center, reported CBS Los Angeles.

The experienced swimmer was 
reportedly with a group of 15 frequent swimmers who dive into the water 
every Saturday in popular spots from Hermosa to Manhattan Beach Pier, 
and who were training for an International Swim Meet.

Robles told reporters he punched the shark in the nose, which is a frequently recommended strategy when faced with an attack.

Robles credits the quick thinking, along with God's intervention, for his survival.

The
 shark had reportedly been hooked by a fisherman, panicked and bit 
Robles in the ribs, back and right arm, causing multiple puncture 
wounds, police told Redondo Patch.

Witnesses
 told the Los Angeles Times the shark had been on the fishing line for 
nearly an hour and panicked, leading to the attack.

He was in the water while part of a group training, the site said, and was still conscious when loaded into the ambulance.

A surfer in the water near the victim told the New York Daily News of the terrifying attack.

'There was blood everywhere and I realized that something had gotten him,' said Casey Fenwick. 'He was screaming the whole time and I understand why.

'I was just worried about getting this guy in and on the board so somebody could help.'

Video from the scene shows the bedlam that ensued as he was pulled to safety.

Urgent: The man was still conscious while being rushed from the water to the ambulance

Two-miles of the beach were closed while authorities worked to move the shark into deeper water, said cops.

‘The deputies directed a lifeguard boat and a Redondo Beach Harbor Patrol boat to the shark,’ said a police statement. ‘A paddle boarder was directed away from the shark by the boat crews. 

‘After approximately 30 minutes, the boats were able to coax the shark out to deeper water and away from the pier.’

A witness told the Los Angeles Times people began screaming ‘white! white!’ for a great white shark.

‘It was a scary scream,’ said Aram Ozen. ‘It was kind of freaky. There was a lot people screaming back to shore.’

Another witness detailed the horror to Patch.

‘The shark was 6-7 feet. A fisherman who regularly tries to catch sharks had it on the line for 45 minutes,’ said Scot Valor. ‘The shark was panicking. The swimmer just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

The beach has since been reopened. The man’s is in stable condition at a local hospital.
