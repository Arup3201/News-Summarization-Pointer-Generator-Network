Lewis Hamilton moved right back into the fight for this season's Formula One World Championship after winning Sunday's action-packed British Grand Prix.

His title rival Nico Rosberg retired from the lead of the race after 29 laps with a gearbox problem handing the victory to Hamilton to the delight of the Silverstone crowd.

Hamilton, now just four points behind Rosberg in the race for the title, could afford to cruise to victory finishing almost 30 seconds clear of the impressive Valtteri Bottas, who started 14th in his Williams, and secured his second consecutive podium.

Daniel Ricciardo completed the rostrum to deny Jenson Button his first podium finish in 15 appearances at his home race.

Hamilton
 started only sixth after his error in yesterday's qualifying session - 
inexplicably aborting his final run believing he couldn't improve on his
 time - but he had already gained two places on the opening lap before 
the race was suspended for an hour following a huge crash involving Kimi
 Raikkonen. 

Raikkonen was taken to the on-track medical centre after he lost control of his Ferrari on the exit of Turn 4.

The
 Finn ran off the circuit but as he attempted to re-join the track on 
the Wellington Straight he caught a bump sending his Ferrari sideways 
and into the barrier.

Raikkonen then slid helplessly across the track
 with the Williams of Felipe Massa, in his 200th grand prix start, 
crashing into the side of his Ferrari despite the Brazilian's last-gasp 
efforts to avoid him.

Raikkonen's Ferrari eventually came to a stop 
on the other side of the circuit suffering damage to his chassis and 
minus three of his wheels.

The Finn, who revealed earlier this week 
he is likely to leave the sport when his contract with Ferrari expires 
at the end of next season, needed assistance getting out of his car 
before limping into the medical car.

Raikkonen was said to have 
suffered bruises on his knees and ankle in the accident and was seen 
limping to the medical car, but a spokesman for Ferrari revealed the 
2007 World Champion was 'OK'.The race was subsequently suspended for one hour as marhsalls made repairs to the guardrail following the high-speed crash.

Massa was forced to retire from the race following the damage sustained to his rear suspension in the incident.

The
 race re-started under the safety car and Rosberg immediately extended 
his lead over Button, who had moved up to second following a poor start 
by Sebastian Vettel.

Hamilton passed Kevin Magnussen at Copse to 
take third. He then set about passing his former team-mate, making light
 work of Button and moving up to second on the following lap.

The Briton then begun his bid to hunt down Rosberg with the German already five seconds clear by the end of the fifth lap.

Hamilton,
 on a charge, managed to get the gap down to under three seconds before 
Rosberg pitted at the end of lap 18, allowing his team-mate to 
temporarily take the lead of the race.

The Briton didn't pit until 
six laps later, but he suffered a problem with his rear-left tyre and 
was stationary for 1.4seconds more than his team-mate.

It appeared to have blown Hamilton's chances of tasting victory in front of his home crowd for the first time in six years.

But
 after taking two seconds out of Rosberg in as many laps, the World 
Championship leader then began to slow to the delight of the patriotic 
British crowd.

Rosberg, who had reported an issue with his gearbox as
 early as lap 20, was then forced to retire from the grand prix, despite
 his, and Mercedes' best efforts, to resolve the problem.It marked his 
first retirement of the campaign.

'Yesterday was a really difficult 
day,' admitted an emotional Hamilton afterwards. 'You never think 
situations like that will come out. I went away feeling terrible for the
 fans thinking I had let them down.

'Coming back to day and turning that serious emptiness into a positivity was my priority. The support has been incredible. I
 had the pace today. I was catching Nico in the first stint. I never 
want a team-mate to fall away and was looking forward to a 
wheel-to-wheel battle, but I am sure we will get plenty of those in the 
future.' 

Fernando Alonso, who started in 16th, was the man on the 
move in the early phase of the race launching an audacious pass on the 
Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo before making a move on Sergio Perez and 
then McLaren's Kevin Magnussen. That left the Ferrari man in 5th after 
just 16 laps, but his progress was thwarted after he was handed a 
five-second stop-and-go penalty for being out of position at the start.

He
 was then involved in a brilliant battle with Sebastian Vettel for fifth
 with the pair both prepared to push the boundaries to gain the upper 
hand.

Vettel ultimately prevailed following a sumptuous pass on Alonso at Copse Corner in the closing stages to finish fifth.

Yet
 with Ricciardo taking the last spot on the podium it marked the fifth 
time in the five races that both Red Bull drivers have finished this 
season where the Australian has beaten his more established team-mate.
