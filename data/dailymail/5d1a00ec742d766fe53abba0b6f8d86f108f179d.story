Newly-announced Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper has defended his potential awards vehicle, American Sniper, against criticism the film is a pro-war portrayal of 'a hate-filled killer who was treated like a hero'.

The movie - directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the memoir of Navy SEAL sharpshooter Chris Kyle, who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career - has come under fire for celebrating a racist 'American psycho' who referred to Muslims as ‘savage, despicable evil' and enjoyed killing.

In one part of the book Kyle wrote: 'I couldn’t give a flying f-- about the Iraqis.'

But Cooper, 40 - who has twice been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar but missed out both times - has hit back, saying the film is one man's story about being a soldier and shouldn't be treated as a political compass for or against the war.

Shooting back: American Sniper star Bradley Cooper says the Oscar-nominated film should be looked at as the story of one solider and not a political tool

Memoir: American Sniper is based on the book by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career. He was shot dead at a gun range in 2013

'My hope is that if someone is having a political conversation about whether we should or should not have been in Iraq, whether the war is worth fighting, whether we won, whether we didn’t, why are we still there, all those (issues), that really—I hope—is not one that they would use this movie as a tool for,' Cooper told The Daily Beast.

'And for me, and for Clint, this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier. 

'The guy that I got to know, through all the source material that I read and watched, and home videos - hours and hours - I never saw anything like that. 

'If it’s not this movie, I hope to god another movie will come out where it will shed light on the fact of what servicemen and women have to go through, and that we need to pay attention to our vets. 

'It’s not a political discussion about war, even … It’s a discussion about the reality. 

'And the reality is that people are coming home, and we have to take care of them.'

Cooper went on to say he doesn't think that American Sniper is so much concerned with Iraq as it is what it's like to serve in a war and then go home.

'Our whole idea was to do a character study about a soldier, and a soldier and a family, and what it’s like having to deal with the schizophrenic nature of having to jostle between a home life and being in theater,' he told The Daily Beast.

'I think hopefully it could be a universal story.'

While American Sniper has received support from the military and received a nomination for Best Picture today at the Oscars, liberals have attacked it for pandering to the narrative of a violent patriot.

In one section of his book, Kyle wrote of one of his four tours of Iraq: 'If you see anyone from about sixteen to sixty-five and they’re male, shoot ’em. Kill every male you see.'

Journalist Rania Khalek described Kyle as 'an American psycho'.

Michael Atkinson from In These Times said the film 'perfectly epitomizes a certain kind of American horsesh--'.

Author Max Blumental tweeted: 'I haven’t seen American Sniper, but correct me if I’m wrong: An occupier mows down faceless Iraqis but the real victim is his anguished soul?'

The Guardian journalist Lindy West wrote: 'The real American Sniper  was a hate-filled killer. Why are simplistic patriots treating him as a hero?'

David Edelstein from Vulture called the movie 'a Republican platform'. 

Criticism: Director Clint Eastwood said it was a 'stupid analysis' to say he was celebrating war or violence

In a separate interview, director Clint Eastwood, 84, said criticism he was celebrating war and killing was a 'stupid analysis' to make.

'Pardon me for sounding defensive, but it certainly has nothing to do with any (political) parties or anything,' Eastwood, 84, told The Toronto Star.

'These fellows who are professional soldiers, Navy personnel or what have you, go in for a certain reason. 

'Their commander-in-chief (President Barack Obama) is a Democrat and the administration is, and there’s no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones.'

Like Cooper, Eastwood maintained American Sniper was a soldier's story, but does believe Kyle was a hero.

'This picture was interesting, because I’m seeing it from the point of a person who was sort of an American hero, as far as his ability to be this ultra-sniper,' he told The Star.

'And his family and his beliefs were very strong about defending the country and defending the guys who are defending the country, as a sort of an oversight warrior. 

'It was an important story, but you have to embrace his philosophy if you’re going to tell a story about him.'

Kyle was shot dead at a Texas gun range in 2013 by a war veteran apparently suffering post traumatic stress disorder.

Movie pundits say American Sniper has a target to pull in over $50 million at the box office this weekend as it goes to wide release.

It will open at 3,555 theaters across the country.
