The first clip from the highly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens will be shown in the US on Friday… but some fans have been taken in ahead of its release by cleverly made fake trailers.

A teaser trailer for The Force Awakens will be shown in at least 100 theaters across America. It’ll be the first ever glimpse of J J Abrams' blockbuster.

However, lots of people thought they’d already had one.

Fake: A scene from a trailer purporting to be for the new Star Wars film

The Fakes Awaken: Some people have been fooled by the fake trailers, such are their quality

A fake trailer titled Star Wars: The Force Awakens International Teaser Trailer uploaded to YouTube on Monday has been viewed over four million times.

It contains slickly edited Star Wars scenes and dramatic voiceovers – even the logos for Disney and Abrams’ production company Bad Robot – and fooled lots of users.

Comments such as ‘amazing’ and ‘incredible’ were posted underneath it, but some quickly figured out that it was a compilation of shots from various films and computer games.

One user realised it was fake from the sound quality.

User Rocky Severino said: ‘I'm an audio engineer and trust me no self respecting studio would ever mix the voices so they could barely be understood because of blaring music and sound effects, just trash.’

Another phony trailer called Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Black Friday Trailer 2015 cheekily used sequences from hit video game Destiny – but still pulled the wool over the eyes of some users.

Doesn't compute: This shot, from a supposed Star Wars trailer, is actually from the trailer for video game Destiny

Hole load of phony: Another scene from Destiny passed off as Star Wars VII

One user said ‘that looked real for a minute!’, while another wrote ‘this looks awesome!’

Star Wars Episode 7 Official Trailer LEAKED, meanwhile, made little effort to pretend it was real, with every shot containing exaggerated lens flare – one of Abrams’ favorite techniques.

The real trailer is expected to be shown for only two days, but will also be available on iTunesTrailers.

Regal Cinemas announced that the real trailer will play before all movies showing at nine of its locations.

Some of the locations where the trailer will be shown are the Edwards Irvine Spectrum 22 & IMAX in Irvine, California, the Edwards Mira Mesa Stadium 18 IMAX & RPX in San Diego, California, the Regal Atlantic Station Stadium 18 IMAX & RPX in Atlanta, Georgia, the Regal City North Stadium 14 IMAX & RPX in Chicago, Illinois and the Regal Union Square Stadium 14 in New York City, among others.

More locations could be announced, maybe from other chains as well.

The trailer is reportedly not very long - a minute at most - and will include only a few glimpses as there has not been enough time to edit and polish the footage.

Abrams has revealed little teases about the film online.He has shared a quick look at the Millennium Falcon and also the X-Wing.

The film is set 30 years after The Return Of The Jedi and is being produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Lucasfilm, and Bad Robot Productions.The Force Awakens will be released on December 18, 2015.

And for comparison, here's the real thing:

The Lord in black: The new film is set 30 years after Darth Vader, seen here in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes back, perished
