The trend for styling our animals in wacky costumes shows no sign of slowing down, but some pets are trickier to dress than others.

Now one blogger, as seen on Buzzfeed.com, has found a way to have fun with her hamster's appearance without any fiddly fashion.

When her daughter asked if they could dress up their pet hamster David Bowie artist Jenny decided to create some ready-to-wear cardboard cut-outs instead.

Designing a mermaid, clown and princess with the help of an old Amazon box the illustrator from Coventry then encouraged David Bowie to pop his head through holes and published the adorable results on her tumblr blog Mythsandfabrications.

'My daughter wanted to dress up her hamster in dolly clothes,' writes Jenny, an artist, illustrator and craft-maker.

'I
 told her that wasn’t really going to work... but if we cut holes in a 
box and make some of those seaside type pictures you stick your head 
through, only hamster sized, perhaps we could make him look like he 
dressed up!

'I should point
 out to anyone concerned about animal cruelty, David Bowie was not forced to do this.'

'He put his head through the holes of
 his own accord, and out of curiosity. It is basically a box with holes 
in, the kind of thing you are encouraged to offer your hamster to play 
in for enrichment,' she added.

'You wouldn’t worry about someone giving their hamster a cardboard tube to play with, this is the same idea.'

Jenny stresses that the paints used are all non-toxic and child-safe, to ensure they would not cause the hamster any harm.

'He
 was only in the box for a few minutes, and we took him out as soon as 
he got bored. If anyone else is intending to do the same, please do so 
responsibly, and with the best interests of your hamster at heart,' she 
warns.
