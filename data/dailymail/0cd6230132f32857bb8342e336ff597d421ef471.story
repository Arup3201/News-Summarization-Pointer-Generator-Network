A seaside village has been snubbed by its millionaire benefactor, after she was so upset they protested her beach cafe that she cut the village out of her will.

Millionaire Gillian Goddard had intended to leave her shares for a massive 750 acre estate to the village of Bantham in Devon when she died.

But when the locals in the village objected to the estates decision to let a food bus use the beach car park, she became so upset she adjusted her will before she died in November last year.

The beach is a popular tourist spot for those who enjoy surfing and sandy beaches, but the villagers took exception to commerce on the quiet beach

Bantham is a small village in Devon, whose land is mostly owned by Evans Estates and the Goddard family

Goddard was one of the five directors of Evans Estates, which includes most of Bantham village, as well as surrounding farmland, and a long beach.

Her husband Tony, 74, said she had devoted her life to the betterment of the village, and had been keen to leave the village 'several million pounds' as a trust fund when she died.

But she changed her mind after Evan Estates' decision to allow a food truck to use the beach car park provoked outcry, including several angry letters of complaint, from the villagers.

Intended to give visitors a chance for refreshment when visiting the beach, the Gastrobus soon garnered angry reaction from the villagers

Gillian Goddard, millionaire benefactor to the village, became so upset at the reaction to the food truck that she cut the village out of her will

The estate had charged fees for the Bantham beach car park, but otherwise had been completely free from commerce until four years ago, when the estate allowed a surf school and a food bus to use the beach.

Tony Goddard said the aim was to help the villagers and visitors by offsetting costs with commerce, while also allowing them to buy refreshments when visiting the beach.

Mr Goddard said: 'Gill's life's work was to look after Bantham. But one of things people 
asked for is whether they could get some food or drink on the beach.

Now that the intent for the estate is to sell it, the people living as tenants in the village are worried about the state of their tenancy if the new owners decide to change the conditions of the village

'So they introduced a Gastrobus to avoid putting in some great big cafe, because they thought it would be environmentally friendly.

'The idea for the Gastrobus provoked an enormous reaction from a small number of villagers who objected to commercialisation of the area.

'She was deeply upset by the suggestion that she and her fellow directors, having looked after the estate for all these years, would do something that was against that policy of preserving the estate.

'Her idea of leaving her company shares on the estate on trust for the village disappeared overnight.'

Before, the estate had a strict no vendors policy to keep the beach and its surrounding farmland free of clutter, but they decided on instituting an official food truck for financial reasons, hoping it might better visitor trips to the beach

He added that there had been no specific plans for the trust fund, just that it should be used for the benefit of the village.

Nick Grodhunce, one of the opponents of the Gastrobus, said he was 'saddened' that the trust fund had been dropped by Mrs Goddard.

He said: 'Both Tony and Gilly did a huge amount of work to preserve what we have here and it is to their credit.

'It is sad but my personal opinion is that the community people have clearly stated that they want to preserve whatever Evans Estates said should be preserved.'

Evans Estates had previously decided to begin commerce on the beach to offset costs of parking to visitors, such as a surf school

The Bantham estate has been owned by Mrs Goddard's family for nearly 100 years, and is now due to be marketed in May, with no official reason given for the sale.

The village have raised concerns about what effect a new owner will have on the area, especially on the tenants of the 21 Evans Estates-owned homes, with many villagers worried about losing their tenancies.
