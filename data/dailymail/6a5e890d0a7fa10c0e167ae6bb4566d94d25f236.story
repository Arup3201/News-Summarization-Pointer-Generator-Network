Plans for a new £10million All-Weather floodlit circuit at Newcastle, which would have opened next year, have been knocked off track by the BHA.

Racing’s ruling body has refused to allow dispensation from a rule, designed to protect the sport’s diversity, which states each individual fixture must include at least two races over a mile or further which total a minimum aggregate distance of two and a half miles.

Newcastle needed the permission because planning restrictions mean their new track would only have lights on its straight mile and not the round course.

While the need for a new AW Flat track in the north is widely accepted, there is strong opposition to Newcastle digging up its Turf circuit.

In an increasingly bitter debate, the BHA have bought some time.

ARC, the largest racecourse company in Britain which owns Newcastle, described the delay to its plans as ‘unwelcome’ but insisted it will press on with the project.

However, any re-submitted proposals next year are likely to see their aspirations to build an AW track competing with rival plans being formulated by Catterick.

The BHA is now committed to further talks with both courses.

Its chief executive Paul Bittar said: ‘There is a general consensus among stakeholders that there would be benefits to the sport from an all-weather track in the north.

‘We weighed up the advantages of introducing a floodlit northern all-weather track at Newcastle in the latter part of 2015 against the negative race planning impact and associated implications for the sport as a whole of granting an exemption to a key rule of racing.

‘As a result, the Board decided there was insufficient evidence at this time to justify granting an exemption to the rule for the 2015 Fixture List.

‘BHA will continue discussions with ARC around its plans for Newcastle, including matters relating to the existing turf track, plus other interested parties, including Catterick Racecourse.

‘This is clearly a significant issue for the long-term structure and development of British racing, and BHA is tasked with reaching the best outcome for the sport as a whole.’

ARC, limited by their planning restrictions, appear to have no scope to alter the Newcastle AW track lay-out.

So, while they have more time to make their case, the facts are unlikely to alter much.

But spokeswoman Susannah Gill insisted Newcastle, with the proposed development of its facilities for racegoers, remains the best option for a new AW track, saying it would be a ‘Wolverhampton of the north’.

She added: ’As well as what we can offer the Horsemen, we would be a popular venue on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. I am not sure Catterick would be.’
