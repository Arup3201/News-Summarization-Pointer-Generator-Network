It is the news that could well cause fans' hearts to skip a beat... Olly Murs is getting waxed.

The Essex-born star is set to become a tourist attraction, with his own waxwork at Blackpool's Madame Tussauds.

And to celebrate his star turn, the singer-songwriter posed alongside his yet-to-be-finished alter ego and tweeted the picture to his six million followers with the comment 'Me and Me selfie'.

Sporting his trademark quiff and cheeky grin, the star announced the launch of his second self at the attraction in March. 

The process of replicating Olly in wax form has taken a team of 20 experts four months to complete, and has cost around £150,000.

Hundreds of measurements and photographs are captured to create as close a likeness as possible, and a dedicated team of sculptures, moulders, colourists and hair stylists make the finished product.

Olly said: 'I'm very excited about getting my wax figure at Madame Tussauds!

'I'm very flattered as I know it's a big honour to have a figure created by such a prestigious attraction. 

'I've really enjoyed getting involved in the process and can't wait to see the finished figure!'

With four number one hits under his belt, the star has established himself as one of the most successful artists in the British music industry.

Matthew Titherington, General Manager at Madame Tussauds Blackpool commented: 'He is one of the most successful male solo artists on the UK chart scene and it is an honour to have him at Madame Tussauds Blackpool.

'Olly's figure was commissioned due to an incredibly high demand, our visitors are always asking if there's a wax figure of the star. 

'We're expecting Olly to be one of our most popular figures at the attraction as he's loved by people of all ages due to his fun nature and natural talent.'
