Henry VIII was a famous jockey, Jane Austen wrote Oliver Twist and St David is the patron saint for England – these are just some of the hilarious responses to the ‘Britishness’ test from young people who are already citizens.

More than half of 18 to 24-year-olds failed the test, which is usually taken by immigrants as part of their application for residency in the UK.

But the research carried out by YouGov revealed that older Britons found the 45 minute test a breeze, with 92 per cent of those over 60 and almost 80 per cent of 40 to 59-year-olds passing.

51 per cent of young people failed practice 'Life in the UK' test usually taken by those seeking British residency

Applicants in the real test must answer 75 per cent of the 24 questions correctly to be officially classed as British citizen.

However some of those quizzed in the sample test from the latest official handbook either incorrectly guessed or didn’t know the answers to some of the questions on history, society and culture.

Five per cent believed Henry VIII was best known for having five sons while one percent thought he was famous for being a jockey.

10 per cent could not name the classic Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility in the multiple-choice task – with two per cent reckoning she had written Oliver Twist.

When asked where the National Assembly for Wales was located, four per cent said it was in Newport rather than Cardiff, and one percent thought it was in Glasgow or London.

Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave was wrongly thought of as a British author by five per cent of participants while 21 per cent believed factory pioneer Richard Arkwright developed new farming methods in the UK.

The test asked which two services were funded by National Insurance and one per cent answered local taxi services and another per cent said supermarket home deliveries.

A handful of those questioned thought Hawaii belonged to the UK while some didn’t know that Remembrance Day and Bonfire Night are always held in November.

Six per cent thought Florence Nightingale was famous for her work on children's education in the 19th century and on per cent said Nelson’s Column and Windsor Castle were built in the Stone Age.

Meanwhile seven per cent thought St David was the patron saint for England and not Wales.

Scotland was the region that scored the worst on the test overall with 20 per cent of the 1,426 sample failing and the south of England (excluding London) coming out top with a 78 per cent pass rate.
