Justine Sacco found herself trending worldwide on Twitter thanks to an ill-thought-out message she intended to be amusing

A PR consultant has revealed how a tweet she sent to amuse her 170 followers ended up making her a global hate figure and ruined her life. 

Justine Sacco's ill-thought-out message, sent before she boarded a flight to South Africa in December 2013 read: 'Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!'

It cost the 30-year-old from New York her job and her reputation after it was re-tweeted by tech blogger Sam Biddle to his 15,000 followers. 

Tens of thousands of people responded in outrage accusing Justine of being ignorant and racist and calling for her to be sacked from her role as the senior director of corporate communications at IAC.

With her phone turned off during her 11-hour flight, Justine had no idea of the furore her tweet had caused or that people were now baying for her blood. 

Unbeknown to her, her employers responded with the statement: 'This is an outrageous, offensive comment. Employee in question currently unreachable on an into flight.' 

The hashtag '#HasJustineLandedYet' began trending worldwide as people were desperate to see how she would react to the thousands of angry tweets and the fact her job was now under threat.

A friend of Justine's deleted her account but the damage was already done. She was subsequently sacked and the public humiliation didn't stop there.

People continued to troll her and more dirt was dug from her deleted Twitter account with BuzzFeed posting an article called '16 Tweets Justine Sacco Regrets'.

Now more than a year on, Justine has spoken of the negative impact the incident has had on her life and how she never intended the tweet to be taken literally.

'Only an insane person would think that white people don't get AIDS,' she told best-selling British writer Jon Ronson as she features in his latest book So You've Been Publicly Shamed.

'I thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal.'

She added that she bitterly regrets posting the comment: 'Unfortunately, I am not a character on ‘South Park’ or a comedian, so I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect manner on a public platform.

'To put it simply, I wasn't trying to raise awareness of AIDS or p*** off the world or ruin my life. 

'Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third world. I was making fun of that bubble.'

Jon, whose previous works include The Men Who Stare At Goats and The Psychopath Test, interviewed Justine as he sought to investigate the impact a social media storm has on the ordinary people lambasted.

Describing his motivation for the book, he wrote in the New York Times: 'As time passed, I watched these shame campaigns multiply, to the point that they targeted not just powerful institutions and public figures but really anyone perceived to have done something offensive. 

'I also began to marvel at the disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the punishment. It almost felt as if shamings were now happening for their own sake, as if they were following a script.'

Justine tells how her public shaming left her jobless and affected her health and wellbeing. 

She said: 'I cried out my body weight in the first 24 hours. It was incredibly traumatic. You don't sleep. You wake up in the middle of the night forgetting where you are.'

While she regrets sending her tweet, she's also resentful of the way its interpretation led to her downfall - and how people she didn't even know seemed to take pleasure in her misfortune.

'I had a great career, and I loved my job, and it was taken away from me,and there was a lot of glory in that. Everybody else was very happy about that,' she said.

She added that it has also ruined her love life: 'I'm single; so it's not like I can date, because we Google everyone we might date. That's been taken away from me too.'

Justine told Jon that she realised she 'couldn't sit at home and watch movies every day and cry and feel sorry for myself' forever and she needed to 'make steps to reclaim my identity and remind myself of who I am'. 

As a result, she now has a new job and is wary of what she shares on social media. She told Jon other than contributing to his book, she won't be speaking out about her story again.

'Anything that puts the spotlight on me is a negative,' she told him. 

In his book, Jon compares social media condemnation to the public floggings of centuries ago. 

He urges people to consider what they post online both in regards to sharing their own views or commenting on the views of others.

He said of Justine's journey: 'When I first met her, she was desperate to tell the tens of thousands of people who tore her apart how they had wronged her and to repair what remained of her public persona. 

'But perhaps she had now come to understand that her shaming wasn't really about her at all. 

'Social media is so perfectly designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and that is what led to her undoing. 

'Her tormentors were instantly congratulated as they took Sacco down, bit by bit, and so they continued to do so. Their motivation was much the same as Sacco's own - a bid for the attention of strangers - as she milled about Heathrow, hoping to amuse people she couldn't see.'
