If there’s one member of Girls Aloud who loves a good time, it’s Sarah Harding.

But the notorious party girl has been spending a lot of time in LA recently, and has clearly picked up on the healthy California lifestyle as she's on a serious health kick.

Speaking to MailOnline, the singer said: ‘I’ve caught the juicing bug. I love being in the kitchen and cooking and creating juices and smoothies.

'I love anything green and I make my own juices packed with kale, parsley, cucumber, courgettes, apples, plus spirulina and chlorella.’

The 32-year-old explained that she keeps in shape by hitting the cross-trainer every day and avoiding carbohydrates, especially before bedtime.

The Berkshire-born beauty, who was once a mainstay at clubs such as Mahiki, is also hooked on supplements.

‘I love supplements, I take multi-vitamins and omega-3, but seriously, I could take the whole cabinet,’ she joked.

Her former partying ways have, however, taken their toll on her skin and she is on a mission to undo the years of late nights.

‘Travelling a lot doesn’t agree with my skin so I am obsessed with cleansing morning and night at the moment.

‘I am hooked on a product called Faceb4, which I use before photo shoots because it removes the bacteria before applying cosmetics and keeps my skin healthy.'

Ambassador: Sarah says travelling doesn't agree with her skin so she uses Faceb4 products, which she just so happens to be the new face of

As the new brand ambassador for the £14.95 product, Sarah was keen to show off the effects in a fresh-faced photo shoot by celebrity photographer, Dan Kennedy.

Speaking about the contents of her make-up bag, the star said: ‘I’m a total product junkie, I absolutely love lotions and potions. As a brand, Rodial is one of my favourites. I also love Elizabeth Arden’s 8 hour cream and anything by MAC cosmetics.

Budget beauty: Whilst Sarah loves Rodial and MAC products, she is also a fan of budget beauty tricks and swears by Vaseline and lavender oil

‘I keep my hair in check with Morrocan Oil, especially the deep conditioning treatment and shine spray,' she added.

Whilst she may be one fifth of one of the most successful girl groups of the decade, Sarah proves she’s still a girl after our own heart with her love of budget beauty products.

‘Beauty products are all so expensive these days but I love a few products under a fiver.

‘I swear by Vaseline, it works for anything, particularly for strengthening eyelashes. Lavender oil is also really good for your skin,’ she revealed.

Having worked alongside the likes of 
Cheryl Cole - who was recently crowned the world’s most beautiful women -  does Sarah rate any of her fellow A-listers in the looks department?

‘There a lots of glamorous and beautiful celebrities but let’s just say, they all have very good hair and make-up artists.

‘I
prefer the more natural look but it takes a lot of guts to leave the 
house without make-up on. I carry sunglasses with me at all times - they
hide the signs of ageing,’ she said.

Sarah
has recently returned from a trip to LA, where she is said to be in 
talks with the E-Style channel regarding a potential reality show with 
boyfriend Mark Foster, a professional DJ.

News
of Sarah’s rumoured TV show follows her revelation that she is keen to 
follow in former band-mate Cheryl’s footsteps by becoming a judge on The
X Factor at some point in the future.

‘It would be good (to be on the show),’ she told The Daily Star. ‘I’d consider it, definitely. I would love to be a mentor.’

Responding
to the stories, Sarah told us: ‘Moving to LA? Really? The rumours about
my reality TV show are not necessarily true, I have just been there 
touching base.

‘Right now I 
am working on my music and yes, I have been looking into acting in LA 
and have just filmed a pilot show for something.’
