 36.1%a year- Lidl's are up by 20.6per cent

Middle class shoppers are deserting Sainsbury’s and other major supermarkets with new research showing budget chains offer big savings on everything from asparagus to blueberries.

Sainsbury’s yesterday revealed its smallest growth in annual profits in 10 years, with the figure rising by a modest 5.3per cent to £798 million.

Industry research shows the chain’s market share is shrinking as the big four supermarkets, which includes Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, struggle to cope with the rise of the cut price rivals.

By contrast, Aldi sales are growing at 36.1per cent a year, while the figure at Lidl is up by 20.6per cent as they make a concerted effort to attract Middle Britain families.

Two reports yesterday demonstrated how the budget stores are succeeding on the back of a combination of low prices and awards for quality food, wine and spirits.

A shopping basket price comparison by the Good Housekeeping Institute looking at 19 items found on a middle class shopping list found huge savings at the budget stores.

The list, which included blueberries, asparagus, pesto, pancetta, Parma ham, rocket, south American ground coffee and Greek yoghurt, came in at just £33.61 in Lidl and £34.01 in Aldi.

Sainsbury’s was more expensive than Asda, Tesco and Morrisons with a shopping bill of £49.32, but most significantly its basket cost some 47per cent more than the Lidl version.

Consumer director at Good Housekeeping, Caroline Bloor, said: ‘Discounters like Lidl and Aldi aren’t just for people looking for cheap basics. Our shopping list shows you can now buy anything from South American filter coffee and ciabatta to Parma ham and flour for the bread maker.

‘Since the recession consumers are no longer embarrassed to be seen hunting out a bargain and why would you when you can save as much as £20 on the same basket of goods’.

Retail analysts Kantar said the mainstream supermarkets are effectively being forced to cut prices in order to stem the loss of shoppers.

Director, Edward Garner, said: ‘There are clear signs that the major supermarkets are reviewing their strategies in the face of increasing competition.  We’re now seeing the big four moving away from ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ promotions and toward everyday low prices.’

Sainsbury’s is being forced to cut prices on some products, despite claims from the chief executive, Justin King, who is about to leave, that shoppers want more than low bills.

Mr King said a focus on quality, affordable own-brand products had helped Sainsbury’s succeed in a tough retail environment.

His swansong as chief executive has been marred by its most recent periodic trading update, which showed a fall in like-for-like sales after 36 consecutive quarters of growth.

But he rejected suggestions that he was leaving the business at the top and said he was confident it would go from strength to strength.

Sainsbury’s results showed a £92 million hit to its balance sheet as it scrapped planned supermarket developments - though it still opened 13 supermarkets during the year and extended six, adding a million square feet of space.

There is now a much greater focus on its network of smaller convenience stores, with 91 opened in the year, taking their total number above the number of supermarkets for the first time, and reaching sales of £1.8 billion.

Sainsbury’s said its premium Taste the Difference range achieved double digit growth with more than £1.1 billion in annual sales, but sales of its ‘basics’ range declined and the brand has been re-launched.

The chain acknowledged that the behaviour of savvy shoppers topping up their weekly supermarket visit with a trip to discounters or convenience stores had become ‘entrenched’ and that prices of staples such as bread, milk and eggs had come down.

It said the market remained ‘intensely competitive’, but insisted it offered better quality and in-store experience than its rivals.

Mr King said: ‘There has been a tremendous amount of concentration on the German discounters because they have seen a good chunk of growth in the last two or three years. But it is also true that convenience stores have been too.

‘Whatever happens in the price skirmishes that we are seeing, we have a business very well equipped to succeed in that environment.’
