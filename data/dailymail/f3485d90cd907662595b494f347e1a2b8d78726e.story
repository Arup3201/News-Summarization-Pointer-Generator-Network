Art of the matter: Petra Ecclestone and her husband James Stunt, who want to take the Van Dyck to LA

It seems an unlikely place to hang an Old Master.

Dubbed ‘Candyland’ by locals, Petra Ecclestone’s vast Los Angeles mansion has 14 bedrooms, three hair salons and a walk-in wardrobe so large it has a second level accessed by an internal staircase.

And that’s not to mention the nightclub, bowling alley and ‘motor court’ for 100 vehicles, including her family’s white Ferrari, white Rolls-Royce Ghost and a black Lamborghini.

Yet, extraordinarily, this is the intended home of Anthony Van Dyck’s last known self-portrait, a £12.5million painting regarded as one of Britain’s greatest cultural treasures.

The Government and the National Portrait Gallery are currently trying to save it for the nation.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal the Van Dyck has been bought by Petra’s 28-year-old husband, James Stunt.

The painting was in private hands for more than four centuries and then bought by art dealer and Antiques Roadshow valuer Philip Mould at auction in 2009 for £8.3million.

He recently sold it to Mr Stunt for £12.5million, but the Government has placed a temporary export ban on him taking it out of the country.

The National Portrait Gallery and the Art Fund, the national fundraising charity for art, have now launched an unprecedented campaign to buy back the painting for the country.

The former poet laureate Andrew Motion, who is leading the campaign, said: ‘This is a self-portrait everybody can enjoy.

'If we lose this painting, it will 
disappear into private hands and eyes and it will be lost to the world. 
But this is a painting about living in the world and the world is where 
it deserves to be.’

Perhaps understandably, Mr Stunt disagrees.

Last night a spokesman for the businessman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘James quite understands the authorities’ point of view but he very much hopes he will be able to take it to his home in Los Angeles and enjoy it.’

Mr Stunt married Bernie Ecclestone’s younger daughter in September 2011, shortly after she bought the Dynasty-style property, once the largest private residence in the United States, for £55 million.

F1 supremo Ecclestone is worth an estimated £2.2billion – more than enough to stock up on the odd artwork or two.

Petra, 24, prefers modern art, once purchasing a Marc Quinn sculpture of twin Pamela Andersons in bikinis, but it seems her husband has more traditional tastes.

The walls of the 123-room LA mansion are
said to be lined with portraits by Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey 
Kneller, the leading portrait painters in England in the 17th and early 
18th Centuries.

Mr Stunt, who also collects vintage Chateau Petrus wine, told an American interviewer: ‘All my Lelys are important.

'In Althorp, the Earl of Spencer has the Windsor Beauties, which is a very famous group of pictures by the artist.

'I’ve been trying to rival the Windsor Beauties. I have more, I think, than him, and I’m just five off the Royal Collection.’

This leaves art critic Brian Sewell  distinctly unimpressed. ‘Oh dear,’ said Mr Sewell. ‘I don’t know him but if he’s setting out to rival Althorp and Buckingham Palace, that’s hardly a meritorious way of collecting. It’s cigarette cards.’

The smouldering Van Dyck self- portrait 
would be the jewel in Mr Stunt’s collection. Painted by the Flemish 
artist shortly before he died, possibly of the plague, in 1641, there is
no doubting its importance.

According to National Portrait Gallery’s director Sandy Nairne, Van Dyck, ‘is one of the greatest artists to have worked in Britain. No other artist has had such a dramatic impact on British portraiture’.

The National Portrait Gallery and the Art Fund now have three months to raise the money. It is the largest fundraising campaign the gallery has ever undertaken and, if successful, would be the fifth most-expensive acquisition by a UK national museum.

The National Gallery and National Galleries of Scotland bought two Titians in 2009 and 2011 for a combined total of £95million, the National Gallery paid £22million for a Raphael in 2004, and last summer the Tate paid £23.1million for a Constable.

The National Portrait Gallery has secured £1.2million so far, including a £500,000 grant from the Art Fund and £700,000 from its own budget.

Art critic Brian Sewell has questioned the validity of buying the painting for £12.5m when it could have been bought four years ago for a much lower price

And the campaign to save this great work is growing. In this week’s edition of Country Life magazine, the famous Girls In Pearls feature was replaced by a full-page reproduction of the painting and a plea to help ‘ensure the painting remains in Britain’.

Critics, however, have questioned the validity of buying the painting for £12.5million when it could have been bought four years ago for a much lower price.

Mr Sewell said: ‘The painting must have been as important in 2009 as it is now. Why did we not buy it then? They didn’t try. They said they put their heads together with Tate Britain to see whether they could do a joint purchase but they didn’t say a word in public. There was no question of raising funds from the public.

‘But now they’re perfectly happy to start a fundraising campaign at £12.5million. The logic of it completely escapes me.

‘I am of the opinion that Sandy Nairne is the most nittish wimp in the business. I think that really the man is so witless he shouldn’t be there. I think Andrew Motion is an ass. What I hate in all these things is the way they’ll trundle in any talking head/personality/celebrity of whom a lot of people have heard.

‘I think he’s the worst poet laureate we’ve ever had, absolutely useless. He wouldn’t know the back of a picture from the front. I really think if you’re going to adduce opinions on something, you should know something about it.

‘If the picture is as important as everyone’s saying it is, it should have been bought at £8.3million. Now that it hasn’t, they’re putting £4million in the pockets of Philip Mould.’

The decision to place an export ban on the Van Dyck was based entirely on the cultural importance of the work. Yet it must rub salt into the wounds of the art establishment that it may now end up in a property of such vulgar excess.

‘Candyland’ was built by former television producer Aaron Spelling. Legend has it that his wife Candy showed the architect a postcard of Buckingham Palace and said: ‘Build me this.’

Mr Sewell says: ‘Well it does rather colour the argument. In intellectual terms, it should not matter but I don’t know.

‘In the years I attempted to be an art dealer, I remember one rich man coming in to look at something.

He decided he didn’t want it and, as he was leaving, he saw another picture and said, “What is that?” I replied, “Oh, that’s far too good for you.” ’

Bizarrely, had Mr Stunt decided to keep the Van Dyck at the couple’s  £66million London home (a seven-storey house in Eaton Square with 14 bedrooms) the painting would have been his by now.

The Government only has the power to challenge the purchase of artworks if the owner wishes to remove them from the country.

Mr Sewell explains: ‘There are a very large number of highly important pictures in private possession in this country and most owners are very happy to lend when a picture is required for an exhibition.

‘If you took all those pictures  away from all those people, you’d have to quadruple the size of the National Gallery.

‘So, in short, all those owners are, as it were, keepers and curators unpaid. They pay all the expense  of the maintenance of the pictures, so private ownership is really a blessing in disguise.

‘But when a painting goes abroad, it tends never to come back. In other words, the loans don’t happen so it’s not quite the same.

‘Quite often, when they’re sharing an exhibition with, say, the National Gallery of Washington and Berlin, you find that an American painting won’t come here. It’s probably because they have some slight misgivings that we might step in and say that’s a national treasure.’

If Mr Stunt’s experience is anything to go by, they might have a point.
