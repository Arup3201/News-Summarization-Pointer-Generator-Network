This family of fluffy monkeys may look pretty bad-tempered, but appearances can be deceptive.

Bez and Ksaka the Colobus monkeys are actually pictured below celebrating the arrival of their son Alan, the second ever of their species to be born at Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire.

Young Alan, who had white fur when he was born three months ago, is now slowly growing black fur to resemble his parents.

And while he will probably end up looking as miserable as they do, for now he looks rather happy with his new look.

Native to Africa, Colobus monkeys are actually extremely sociable, despite the colouration of their fur giving them an unhappy look.

With the arrival of the new sunnier weather, Alan has been enjoying bouncing around his enclosure with his sibling, Christopher, and the rest of his family group.

Park curator Jamie Craig said: 'The group now has two playful infants to keep an eye on as they make the most of the warm spring weather.

'All adults take a role in babysitting and luckily, Kasaka is a very patient dad.'

The newest born was named after employee Alan Price, who has worked at Cotswold Wildlife Park since 1997 and says Colobus Monkeys are his favourite species.

They live in family groups comprising
one male, several females, and their offspring, and female Colobus 
monkeys usually announce that they are ready to mate by tongue smacking.

With females giving birth to a single offspring approximately every 20 months, Ksaka has got his work cut out for him.

In the wild, males leave their birth groups before they are fully mature, either by choice or by force, and live alone or in small bachelor groups.

Some will eventually take over a harem of their own.

Each group has its own territory in the tree canopy that is well defined and defended.

The word 'colobus' is derived from the Greek 'kolobus', meaning 'mutilated one'. It refers to their thumb, which is little more than a short stub.

The Colobus monkeys are extremely sociable and live in large family groups comprising a male, the females he mates with, and their offspring

The monkeys run on all fours along familiar routes through branches, and take turns sleeping at night so that one member of the troop is always awake and watching for predators.

Males defend their group and territory from others with roars, tongue-clicks, chases, and an unusual stiff-legged display.
