Dr June Shazeela Allim has been found dead at her home two weeks after she was arrested on suspicion of fraud

A respected female GP was found dead two weeks after she was arrested on suspicion of fraud, it has emerged.

Dr June Shazeela Allim’s husband Dr Henry White called emergency services after her body was discovered on Wednesday.

Paramedics rushed to their £975,000 home in Norton Lindsey, Warkwickshire, at around 2pm but were unable to revive the 53-year-old and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious.

Dr Allim worked alongside her 55-year-old husband at the Budbrooke Medical Centre, in the Warwickshire village of Hampton Magna, four miles from Warwick.

Two weeks ago Warwickshire Police raided the surgery amid allegations of fraud and arrested Dr Allim who was later released on bail.

A post-mortem examination will be carried out later to establish the cause of death.

The surgery was closed on Wednesday afternoon but re-opened on Thursday with locum GPs taking over appointments.

Neighbours of the couple, who had been married for 28 years and had one grown-up daughter, yesterday speculated that Dr Allim killed herself after the pressure of the fraud investigation got too much to bear.

One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It looks like she was under a lot of pressure and when the police got involved it just pushed her over the edge.

'It’s very sad because she and her husband were very popular in the village.'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed they were called to the home for a 'medical emergency'.

A spokesman for Budbrooke Medical Centre, said: 'It is with great sadness that we have been made aware that Dr Allim passed away. The practice manager is informing patients.'

A Warwickshire Police spokesman said: 'Police are treating the death of a 53-year-old female in Norton Lindsey, Warwick, as unexplained.

'Warwickshire Police is supporting the NHS regarding an investigation into an allegation of fraud at Budbrook Medical Practice. The investigation is ongoing.

'A 53-year-old female from Warwick was questioned in connection with the investigation which is still ongoing. She was released on bail.'

The surgery boasts on its website about being a 'rural practice with a husband and wife partnership'.

It goes on: 'We are proud of our longstanding personal relationships with our patients which allows us to provide a high quality of care to our existing patients and which we aim to provide to all of our new patients.'

The couple were also involved with a children’s home in Uganda and spent a lot of time abroad.

A spokesman for NHS England stressed standards of care have not been compromised.

He said: 'There is an ongoing investigation into Budbrooke Medical Centre in Warwickshire.

'The practice will remain open and patients should attend appointments they have made unless they are contacted by the practice. The practice remains responsible for the provision of services to patients.

'NHS England is the commissioner of that service and looks forward to working with the practice to ensure that patients continue to receive the primary medical services they require. Patients should contact the practice for appointments as usual.

'There is no evidence of any clinical issues and NHS England’s Associate Medical Director, Dr Francis Campbell reassured patients that while there will be a full investigation into all activities carried out at the practice, there is no suggestion that patients have received anything but a high standard of clinical care.'
