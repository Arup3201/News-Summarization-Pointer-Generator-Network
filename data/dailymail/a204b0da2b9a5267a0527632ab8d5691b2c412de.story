For everyone who has ever thought about shooting their boss - metaphorically, o fcourse - this one is for you.

An employee of a Texas armored car company got to do just that this week to 'demonstrate that they take client safety seriously'.

And to further that demonstration, the CEO was sitting alone inside the Mercedes-Benz as 12 rounds from an AK-47 rained down upon the SUV.

The company, Texas Armoring Corporation, has supplied protected vehicles to the Pope, celebrities like rapper T.I. and actor Steven Segal and oil executives in West Africa, according to My San Antonio.

Proving a point: Employees of the Texas Armoring Corporation, including CEO R. Trent Kimball, prepare to demonstrate just how effective their protected cars can be

Lock, stock and barrel: Sales and export compliance manager, Lawrence Kosub, prepares to fire at the SUV

Boom: The rounds hit the windscreen at exactly the point where Kimball is sitting

Unflinching: The CEO does not move as the rounds hit the car one-by-one

Major hit: Kosub shot a total of 12 rounds at the vehicle

Just another day at work: Kimball casually steps of the vehicle that was hit 12 times

The shots were fired by the company's sales and export compliance manager, Lawrence Kosub, who seemed very familiar with an assault rifle.

In the driver's seat was Texas Armoring Corporation president R. Trent Kimball.

All of Kosub's shots hit the windscreen and none of them breached it. 

'When it comes to assuring our clients' safety, we take product testing extremely seriously,' Kimball says in a video taken of the display.

'Life is valuable - protect it,' Kimball adds at the end.

Kimball does not address whether he is nervous before getting in the vehicle, but he doesn't appear to be. 

It has since been uploaded to YouTube and, as any good PR campaign should, will likely get them many more clients.
