Eleven medics have been suspended from a hospital after a man collapsed outside the building and died.

The man had been admitted earlier and was being treated by doctors inside the hospital but had decided to take some fresh air outside the entrance to A&E at Walsall Manor Hospital, West Midlands, when he keeled over.

As he lay on the ground passers-by were seen to take mobile phone photographs and video, some of them laughing.

It is alleged that staff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, initially ignored the patient's plight.

The man, who is said to be middle-aged and from the local area, had arrived at the hospital suffering from chest pains.

An eye-witness said: ‘The man just dropped dead outside the hospital and nobody seemed to know what to do to help him.’

‘I was outraged when members of the public actually started filming him, and taking photos on their mobile phones as they walked by and laughed.

‘It really makes you wonder what kind of people we are producing in this country these days.

‘But, worst of all, it seemed that none of the professionals on duty saw it as their problem to help this poor man.

‘I really do hope they get to the bottom of what happened there that day.

‘No-one deserves to die like that, not with such a lack of dignity and support.’

The tragedy happened on Saturday June 23, outside the Accident and Emergency department of Walsall Manor Hospital.

The medical staff, including nurses, porters and four paramedics from West Midlands Ambulance Service have now been suspended and a full investigation launched by Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust.

Jayne Tunstall, Chief Operating Officer at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust said: ‘I can confirm that an incident happened on the Walsall Manor Hospital site, on Saturday June 23, in which a patient died.

‘A full investigation has been launched by the Trust and is currently ongoing and a number of staff have been suspended as part IVES U of this investigation.’

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added: ‘Four members of staff have been suspended and a full investigation has been launched by the Trust which is expected to be completed within the next two weeks.

‘The Trust will do everything necessary to maintain the high standards of care that our staff and the organisation provide to patients.’
