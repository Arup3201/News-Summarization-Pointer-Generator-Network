Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Snapchat could be blocked after David Cameron promised to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online.

In a challenge to critics of the so-called snoopers’ charter, he said fanatics should not be able to talk to each other without security agencies listening in.

Making an electoral campaign speech in Nottingham yesterday, Mr Cameron indicated he would revive monitoring legislation – blocked by the Liberal Democrats – if he secures a majority in May.

Pledge: David Cameron has promised to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online

The Prime Minister said that he would stop the use of methods of communication which cannot be read by security services, such as WhatsApp, which encrypts its data

‘The attacks in Paris once again demonstrated the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies to keep our people safe,’ he said.

‘The powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data or on the content of communications, I am very comfortable that those are absolutely right for a modern, liberal democracy.

‘If I am Prime Minister, I will make sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other.’

The Prime Minister also added that he would stop the use of methods of communication, which cannot be read by the security services such as WhatsApp and Snapchat, due to data being encrypted.

Warning: The head of the MI5, Andrew Parker, has warned that ‘if parts of the radar go dark’ and terrorists are beyond the reach of his agency, Britain would be more vulnerable to attack

He explained: 'Are we going to allow a means of communications which it simply isn’t possible to read?

'My answer to that question is: ‘No, we must not.'

His comments reignited the Coalition row over civil liberties. In a speech today, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say Mr Cameron’s plans would undermine privacy.

Calls for greater access to the online activities of jihadists have been reawakened by the atrocities in France.

The head of the MI5, Andrew Parker, has warned that ‘if parts of the radar go dark’ and terrorists are beyond the reach of his agency, Britain would be more vulnerable to attack.

Today, Mr Clegg will hit back, saying it ‘would mean a new, indiscriminate power for governments to record every man, woman and child’s web history, emails and social media interactions regardless of whether they are guilty or innocent.

In 2013, Mr Clegg killed off a proposed law that would have required web firms to store data about users’ internet activities.
