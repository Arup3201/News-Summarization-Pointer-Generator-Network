A brave young girl who has battled leukaemia since 2010 is set to enjoy her first Christmas without cancer in three years.

Ruby Orr, seven, was diagnosed in February 2010 after suffering from a cold and leg pains. She underwent grueling chemotherapy sessions to try and rid her body of the disease.

The creative youngster from Manchester took to customising shoes to cheer herself up during her treatment and even set up her own business.

Ruby has now been in remission since May and is relishing the chance to enjoy many 
festive firsts - such as swapping Christmas cards with her class mates.

Her mother Vanessa, 42, said: 'She's looking forward to it so much and as a family it's been the Christmas we've been praying for.

'It will be the first Christmas in 
three years Ruby's not been in chemotherapy and we can't wait to see her
 enjoying herself and having the Christmas she deserves.

'The little things, like having 
Christmas cards to open from all her friends at school, mean so much to 
her because it's stuff she hasn't been able to do before.

The schoolgirl from Denton, is also fit enough to hold a birthday party for the first time since starting her treatment.

'She's having a chocolate-themed 
birthday party with all her friends next week, which she's incredibly 
excited about, and it's wonderful to see her have all these things to 
look forward to because she's been so brave,' Mrs Orr said.

Ruby now has a check-up with her doctor every three months.

She first won the hearts of the nation after starting her own shoe-making business. Her diamante-encrusted creations proved so popular with 
family and friends that she set up a small business called Ruby 
Slippers. She even designed a pair for singer Suzanne Shaw to wear in the pantomime Cinderella last year.

But despite being back to full health, Ruby hasn't lost passion for her crystal creations. She recently auctioned two canvasses of Manchester footballing heroes Wayne Rooney and Mario Balotelli for Â£600 in aid of Wish Upon A Star.

The charity took Ruby to Lapland to meet Father Christmas last year along with dozens of other children suffering from life-threatening illnesses.
