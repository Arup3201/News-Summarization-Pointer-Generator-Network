For Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, the summer months of 2013 amounted to a quite brutal induction into the highly-charged arena of transfer dealings at the highest level.

On a damp Monday evening in September, as the lights went out on Manchester United’s frantic attempts to recruit stars of elite standing, Woodward, red-faced and racked by self-recrimination, privately vowed that never again would United leave things so late.

A hap-hazard, scattergun approach had been shown up and within the corridors of power at Old Trafford, there was a recognition that United had come up short, signing only the lamentable Marouane Fellaini.

Development: After a slow start to last season Herrera has continued to develop into an all-round star

Indeed, it was only ten minutes before the 11pm deadline on September 2 that a bid for Fellaini was finally accepted by the Everton board.

As the outlook at home appeared increasingly bleak, the chain of events that developed on the Iberian peninsula entered the realm of the bizarre, descending into embarrassing acrimony, amid reports that three suited men, carrying leather briefcases, had emerged at the headquarters of the Spanish league, apparently with the authorisation to seal a €36 million move for the Basque midfielder Ander Herrera.

The alleged ‘imposters’, as they were branded by the Spanish Press – in reality, they were three highly reputable lawyers from the firm Laffer Abogados – had been involved in pushing through Bayern Munich’s signing of Javi Martinez the previous summer, possessing a an expertise in the legal issues that can complicate deals involving buyout clauses.

United, for their part, denied any association with Rodrigo Garcia Lucas, Alvaro Reig Gurrea and Francisco Salinas Mezquita – and the affable receptionist at Laffer Abogados seemed more than a little perturbed when they received phone calls from Sportsmail the following morning. 

United, who have their own lawyers in Spain, also bristled at suggestions they would need to call in experts to navigate their way through the Basque country’s complex tax rules, rather offended by the notion that a club of their size and reputation would be unable to confront relatively straightforward financial regulations.

In truth, United did not require the services of any legal experts that day, for they had no intention of matching Athletic Bilbao’s buyout clause last summer, with the two clubs’ valuations for the player set at around £10million apart.

United’s bid approached £25million but David Moyes and Woodward resolved to push that bid no further, believing that they could not justify the extra expense at that stage.

Now taking in the reigns of three Manchester United managers,  Herrera has been a long-standing target at Old Trafford, monitored consistently and closely since he played a starring role in Bilbao’s mesmeric performance in a 3-2 victory at Old Trafford in the Europa League in 2012.

He is one of several that United have continued to keep an eye on, along with midfielder Ander Iturraspe and forward Iker Muniain. 

On a spring Thursday evening, United could have been hit for six, as Marcelo Bielsa’s side utterly outplayed Sir Alex Ferguson’s team.

In the summer that followed, Ferguson and United scouts pondered long and hard but eventually felt that Herrera should be allowed to develop a little longer in Spain.

Ideally, they wanted him to score more goals, becoming the heir to Paul Scholes but there was also a concern that both Barcelona and Manchester City would provide competition for his signature.

The decision was taken to wait until the next summer and the manager’s brother, Martin Ferguson, continued to monitor his developments.

By then, of course, Ferguson had stepped aside, having laid the foundations for a move for Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona while Moyes had assumed the hot-seat.

It would be an exaggeration to say that Herrera was the midfielder at the top of his wish-list, with Cesc Fabregas assuming that place, while plans to sign Thiago were shelved, as Moyes decided he required more extensive research into the player, who joined Bayern Munich instead.

Herrera, however, remained on the radar, with Moyes recognising the urgent need for a player of style and substance in the central acres and he emerged as a serious target as the days counted down towards the end of the transfer window.

Unfortunately, Herrera could barely have been at a more unaccommodating club from United’s perspective. Bilbao, who stand as a beacon of Basque national identity, maintain a long-standing philosophy to only utilise players from that region.

Such a small pool dictates that Bilbao demand the highest prices, often the buy-out clause, for their assets and Herrera was no exception.

There would be no short-cuts on this deal. United’s early faith – a wage package is understood to have been agreed in principle last summer and there were even suggestions that a squad number had been set aside for Herrera – diminished as the clock ticked down.

Moyes resolved to return for his man in January but United grew increasingly disturbed by Herrera’s disappointing start to the season.

The speculation appeared to affect his form, Herrera losing his place in the Bilbao starting line-up.

As winter came, though, Herrera rediscovered his touch, as his side struck 15 goals in three games in January and Moyes came close to resurrecting a deal in the mid-season window. Ultimately, he decided to settle for the signing of Juan Mata alone.

United’s interest, however, had been rekindled and dialogue was maintained between the clubs.

Officials were aware that Herrera, despite his stock waning somewhat over the last eighteen months, has remained in the thoughts of Barcelona and they recognise a midfield player with the strength and power to adapt to the rigour of the Barclays Premier League and the graceful quality that has often eluded United.

Pricey: Herrera is thought to cost in the region of £28m, but his release clause increases in July

This summer, Woodward is leaving little to chance and having clumsily paid in excess of Fellaini’s exit clause last summer, United were determined not to fritter away cash so easily once more.

At the beginning of July, Herrera’s buyout clause at Bilbao is due to rise by several million pounds and it is this that has compelled United to act swiftly and pay a little more than they may previously have liked – the fee will be in the region of £28.4 million, including add-ons – to ensure they finally get their man. 

With Louis van Gaal determined to reinforce the United midfield with energy and dynamism, United have returned decisively, believing that under the right manager, at the right club, they have a player that will live up to the potential that the 6 foot tall, 24-year-old demonstrated on that March evening at Old Trafford two and a half years ago.
