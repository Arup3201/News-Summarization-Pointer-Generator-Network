The pomp and ceremony surrounding the presentation of Wayne Rooney's golden cap was typically English, but looking at the Wembley pitch you may have thought the game was taking place across the Atlantic.

The NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars played at Wembley less than a week before England's Euro 2016 qualifying clash with Slovenia, and evidence of their presence was clearly visible as Rooney led his side out on Saturday.

The surface was quick to tear up after minimal contact, and the markings from the gridiron were still apparent throughout the pitch.

In a week where Real Madrid revealed they send their groundsman to inspect pitches before playing on them to prevent injuries, Premier League bosses will be unimpressed their England stars were forced to play on such a poor quality surface.

Politicians and Wembley bosses have struggled to hide their glee at the prospect of an NFL franchise playing regularly at the home of English football, but perhaps some could do with reminding this pitch was designed and built at great cost for English, not American, football.

The Slovenian team even lodged a complaint about the conditions prior to the match. 

England boss Roy Hodgson admitted he was surprised they had done so, telling ITV: 'I was out there now and it didn't look that bad to me to be honest.

'Talking about the pitch and making a lot of statements about it before the game is a strange thing to do. We'll see how the game goes and the result first before talking about that.'

His comments, though, were in contrast to the opinion he voiced earlier in the week when he said: 'I can't pretend that (the NFL clash at Wembley) is something that makes me leap for joy.

'If I was asked if it was a good thing or not, I would have to say not.'
