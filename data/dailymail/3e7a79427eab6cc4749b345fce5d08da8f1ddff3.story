Britain is on track for the third warmest spring since records began, the Met Office has revealed.

The average temperature of 8.97C from March to May is the hottest to date, bettered only by 2007 and 2011.

And we have cloudy skies to thank, as forecasters claim an unexpected bout of overcast has kept the warmth in.

Basking: Britons have enjoyed some of the warmest weather to date since 1910 during the third hottest spring

Dark and warm: Forecasters claim cloudy skies have contributed to the heat by 'acting as a blanket'

This season has seen just 76 per cent of average sunshine, and 40 per cent more rain than expected.

However, it has come during six months of above-average temperatures.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: 'The figures show that warm weather doesnâ€™t always mean sunny weather.

'The significant factor this year which has made this spring warmer is that we haven't had many cold nights.

'We have had a lot of cloudy weather - cloudy days but particularly cloudy nights - which acts as a blanket and keeps the warmth in.

'In previous years, it has been clearer and therefore colder.'

She added: 'It has been slightly 
different this year in that air has been coming in from the south west 
and the sea, rather than the north west and the arctic.

'It is this maritime influence, rather than an arctic influence, which has possibly made spring warmer.'

Last year, the average temperature across Britain peaked at 6C - almost 3C colder than this spring.

If the current weather persists for the last three days of May, Scotland will celebrate its hottest spring to date.

For England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it will be the third hottest.

England has enjoyed average temperatures of 9.76C this spring.

Wales saw a mean of 9.04C, while Northern Ireland maintained a 9C average.

The season has also been one of the wettest, with 140 per cent of the average rainfall expected for this time of year.

It has also seen a wide range of conditions - from torrential rain to sweltering heat.

Temperatures this weekend are generally warm, with bright skies and light wind.
