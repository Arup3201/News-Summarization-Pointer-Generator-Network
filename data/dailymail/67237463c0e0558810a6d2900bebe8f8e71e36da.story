Veteran: David Loman, the last British-based surviving member of the International Brigades which fought against General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, has died

The last known UK-based survivor of a 2,500 strong army of Britons who fought with left-wing forces against General Franco's facists in the Spanish Civil War has died.

David Lomon, from Slough, Berkshire, who fought with Republican forces in the bloody civil war which waged from 1936 until 1939, died on Friday aged 94.

Former brothers-in-arms in the International Brigade have since described him as a 'classic English gentleman'.

He fought in the two-month Battle of Teruel which claimed more than 140,000 lives and was a turning point in Franco's eventual victory.

Mr Lomon also fought in the Aragon offensive where the Republican side faced the might of Franco's forces which were bolstered by more than 100,000 extra troops supplied by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.

Although he was captured in March 1938 and lived off starvation rations while enduring brutal beatings, he survived and was freed in exchange for Italian prisoners-of-war held captive in Britain later the same year.

Hackney-born Mr Lomon signed up for the secret International Brigades in secret in 1936 after a clash with Oswald Mosley's facist group the Blackshirts at the Battle of Cable Street.

After expressing an initial interest at a London office, the Young Communist league member was tested for his suitability for the Brigade in Paris.

He then travelled the Pyrenees, avoiding Franco's border guards late at night and entering Spain to join the battle.

Volunteers: Just a handful of the 2,500 British men who volunteered for the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. More than 35,000 people from across the globe volunteered to fight General Franco

Mr Lomon was among illustrious company, joining trade union leader Jack Jones and writers George orwell and Laurie Lee among more than 35,000 volunteers from across the globe to sign up to fight against Franco's army.

When captured by Franco's men, Mr Lomon was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp at San Pedro de Cardenos near Burgos in northern Spain.

Conditions there were crowded and filthy and with food and medical facilities woefully inadequate, most of the camp's captives suffered sickness.

Mr Lomon made it out alive, but a fifth of those taken prisoner were not so lucky.

After he was freed by Franco's forces, Mr Lomon served in the Second World War in the Royal navy.

He eventually returned to Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, and worked in the textile trade.

His affinity for the International Brigade didn't end though and he attended various ceremonies including the unveiling of a volunteers' memorial on London's South Bank last spring.

Jim Jump, secretary of the International Brigade Trust, paid tribute to Mr Lomon in The Independent.

He said: 'He had a conventional life when he returned. He was not the type to boast about what he did.

'He was a lovely man; very polite; a classic English gentleman.'

The only known British survivor of the International Brigades to outlive Mr Lomon is Stan Hilton who now lives in Australia.

The International Brigade was made up of volunteers from 54 countries.

Many signed up to fight because they were alarmed at the thought of another European country succumbing to facism.

Pleas from the Spanish Government for help from other European countries when the Germans and Italians decided to back the rebel forces fell on death ears - many were afraid that their involvement would lead to a continent-wide conflict and believed that the best way to avoid that was by keeping the Germans and Italians appeased.

But with Spain on its own, bystanders from all over the world signed up to help the Republicans, vetted and enrolled in Frace by a Communist group there.

The International Brigade took part in a staunch defence of Madrid after the Government fled to Valencia as rebel forces approached.

As they fended off one attempt on the city from the Nationalists in 1937, the Republican fighters lost 25,000 men.

The Republicans and International Brigade vowed that they would make Madrid the 'tomb of facism.'

Most of the British volunteers who, like Mr Lomon, found themselves in prisoner-of-war camps were captured in February 1937 at the battle of Jarama and in march at the battle of Calaceite.

The Spanish Civil War was fought between July 17 1936 and April 1 1939 and saw tens of thousands Spanish Republican and Nationalist soldiers, rebels and civilians killed.

The war began after a declaration of opposition from a group of generals of the Spanish Republic Armed Forces against the elected Government of the Second Spanish Republic led by Manuel Azana, voted in just five months previously.

The coup was supported by military units in Morrocco, Pamplona, Vallidolid and elsewhere, but units from major cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia were opposed leaving the country divided both in terms of military and politics.

The rebels led by General Francisco Franco waged a war of attrition against their opponents and gained the support of Nazi Germany and Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini.

The UK's official stance was one of non-intervention, but that didn't stop thousands signing up to fight with the Republican International Brigade.

Attrocities were committed by both sides during the bloody war which was eventually won by Franco's nationalist rebels.

He went on to rule for 36 years and losing Republican supporters were often persecuted thereafter.
