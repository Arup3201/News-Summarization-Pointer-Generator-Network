This adorable baby orangutan obviously wanted a bear hug before going to sleep after curling up with its favourite teddy for a nap.

The sleepy ape, whose mother died in the wild, is one of more than 600 orangutans being cared for at an orphanage in Borneo.

Young orangutans stay with their mothers until they are seven-years-old in the wild and are unlikely to survive if left to fend for themselves before they are fully grown.

Female volunteers at the centre help to care for the orphaned apes 24 hours a day by treating them like their own children - feeding them, changing their nappies and playing with them.

As they grow up, their surrogate parents will help them learn how to climb trees, find food and other essential survival skills.

Some of these orphans'
mothers were brutally slaughtered – by workers in the oil palm 
plantations – as they searched for food because illegal logging is destroying their natural rainforest habitat.

Others are victims of poaching or the illegal pet trade and have been rescued from a life of incarceration and misery.

The orphans will likely spend between 10 and 12 years at the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation rehabilitation center on Bangamat Island before finally being released back into the wild.
