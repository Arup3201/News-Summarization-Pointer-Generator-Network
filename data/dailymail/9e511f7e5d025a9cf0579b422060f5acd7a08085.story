Apple has weeded out a popular game from its app store that sees users try and create a successful marijuana-growing empire.

Weed Firm had become the No1 game on the App Store in all categories.

However, the game was pulled on Tuesday with Apple yet to explain why.

Rejected: Weed Firm was removed from Apple's App Store on Tuesday

There are currently dozens of marijuana-themed games on the App Store including Weed Strains 3D, Weed Tycoon and Weed Memory Game.

Though Apple did reject a similar game to Weed Firm called Herb Converter.

In Weed Firm players control a character called Mr Ted Growing, who interacts with other drug dealers and sells his produce for the highest price possible.

The game’s developer, Manitoba, posted a statement on its website following the rejection of the app that was attributed to Mr Grower.

It said: ‘As you might have noticed the game is no longer available on the Apple App Store. This was entirely Apple's decision, not ours.

‘One thing we can promise you is that we will be back! The Apple version might need to be censored a bit to comply with Apple's strictest requirement since they are going to be looking very attentively at what we submit from now on.’

It said sarcastically: 'We guess the problem was that the game was just too good.'

The game is also banned from Google’s Play Store, but the statement explained that the app itself wasn’t the problem.

It added: ‘Google never had a problem with the application itself. The problem was with our publisher and we are expecting to return to the Play Store once we find a suitable publisher.’

Apple isn’t just sensitive to drug themes. Apps that feature famous people, nudity and even radiation detection have been banned.

Obama Trampoline, in which players bounce politicians around the Oval Office, was banned because Apple does not approve of ridiculing public figures.

Tawkon Radiation Detector, meanwhile, which calculates exposure to electromagnetic radiation from phones, was rejected as Apple was concerned that it could cause alarm.

And Pocket Girlfriend, where users can interact with semi-nude women, was banned for being demeaning.
