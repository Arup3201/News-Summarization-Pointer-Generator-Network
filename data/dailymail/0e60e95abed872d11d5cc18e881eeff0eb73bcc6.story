Orphaned at just two-weeks-old, Joey the kitten is shopping for a new home and his new found friend Chesney is helping him on his way

Joey’s mother was killed crossing the road near Exeter, Devon leaving Joey homeless until he was accepted by a mother with six-week-old kittens at a cat adoption centre.

But with the three older kittens already there’s not enough room for little Joey to stay too long so he’s on the lookout for a new home just like his new 'step-brother' Chesney through Exeter Axhayes Adoption Centre.

Shopping for a home: Joey and Chesney are at a cat adoption centre looking for a home so they don't spend kittenhood in a pen

The pair of pussy cats have been having fun getting to know each other, playing in a toy shopping trolley at the centre.

The centre has lots of kittens like Joey who shouldn’t spend kittenhood in a pen.

Their website says: 'They are all looking for loving safe homes to go to as soon as possible.

'They really want to experience their first adventure in a nice garden, to play in the grass and look at all the wonderful things that summer brings.'

They find homes for 700-800 cats a year as one of the UK’s leading feline welfare charities.

If you are able to offer Joey, Chesney or any of the kittens a home, call 01395 232377 or visit the centre for more information.

Growing up fast: Joey will stay with his foster mother until he's big enough to leave her for a new home
