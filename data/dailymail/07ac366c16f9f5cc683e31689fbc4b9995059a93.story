After the first hat-trick of his professional career, Danny Welbeck was on rock-solid ground as he launched into a defence of his goalscoring record.

Three in the Champions League for Arsenal against Galatasaray took his tally to six in 10 games for club and country this season, all scored from a central position, which he insists is the key to an extended run in the goals.

‘Nobody can really criticise my finishing because they don’t really see me playing in a forward position too often,’ said Welbeck.

‘But now I’m getting into these positions I want to be sticking the ball in the back of the net.

‘I’m sure it’s the same with every other striker. People can say I’ve not scored enough goals, but you stick the best strikers on the wing in a four-man midfield and see if they score goals.

‘If you’re getting goals and getting a run of games in your preferred position, your confidence is going to grow and performances are going to grow. That’s something I’m looking forward to doing, building on those performances.

‘Maybe beforehand I wasn’t getting through on goal if I was coming from midfield. It’s difficult to leave your position to go and get goalscoring opportunities, but I’m getting into these positions much more regularly now, and I’m looking forward to sticking the ball in the back of the net.’

Former Arsenal manager George Graham was among those who criticised Welbeck in front of goal. ‘Welbeck is a very willing boy,’ said Graham.

‘He works his socks off for the team. He’s got to improve his finishing a lot though.’

Two for England against Switzerland last month was a good start and three against Galatasaray on Wednesday even better, but the £16million signing from Manchester United has to prove he can be just as clinical in the big games against the big teams, starting against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. 

Arsenal had an awful record away from home against the best teams in the Barclays Premier League last season. They were beaten 6-3 at Manchester City, 5-1 at Liverpool and 6-0 at Chelsea.

Olivier Giroud, in 15 games against those same three teams, has scored only twice. 

Welbeck’s record is similar, with one goal in 23 games against the same opposition for Manchester United and Arsenal, although some of those appearances were on the wing or from the bench.

He has made a promising start to his Arsenal career, rekindling memories of Thierry Henry with his finishing style on Wednesday, but this is the challenge he must rise to if he is to develop like Henry into a truly great striker.

England boss Roy Hodgson was at the Emirates to see Welbeck’s hat-trick before confirming his place in the squad yesterday for next week’s Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

‘It seems to me in the days of very large transfer fees that £16million does seem a fairly reasonable price to pay,’ said Hodgson.

‘But it is up to Daniel to show he is worth that money. If he continues to do so well that people are writing “this was a steal” or “this was a great piece of business” even better still.

‘With Daniel, we need to be careful. He is getting more responsibility in the Premier League and Champions League and so far it seems to be going very, very well but let’s not put too much pressure on him.

‘I hope it works out at the end of the season and I hope people say this was a good piece of business for Arsenal and they got a very good player at a good price.’
