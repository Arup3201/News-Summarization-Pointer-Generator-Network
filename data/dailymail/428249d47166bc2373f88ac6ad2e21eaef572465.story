Thousands of patients are having to wait too long to start vital treatment for cancer (file picture)

Thousands of patients are having to wait too long to start vital treatment for cancer.

The NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer.

The target requires 85 per cent of patients to be seen, but this fell to 84.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2014-15, resulting in 10,000 patients waiting too long, say campaigners.

The target was also breached for the first time since 2009 in the preceding quarter – the last quarter of 2013-14.

The number of people waiting more than 62 days in the first six months of 2014 was 9,906.

Figures from NHS England also show that the two-week wait target for women with breast symptoms, not initially thought to be cancer, was breached.

The target says 93 per cent of women should be seen quickly by a specialist, but in the last quarter for which figures are available this year it was 90.3 per cent.

Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It’s simply not good enough that the cancer waiting time target for patients to begin treatment following an urgent GP referral has been breached in England for the second quarter in a row.

‘Around 10,000 people have already had to wait longer than the recommended 62 days to start their treatment this year.

‘Furthermore, there has been a ten-fold increase over the last year in the number of hospital trusts where patients with suspected cancer are waiting longer than two weeks to be seen by a specialist.

‘This shows that the current system simply isn’t working and people with cancer are being badly let down.

Mr Hobday added: ‘We have some of the poorest survival rates for cancer in Europe and Macmillan is calling on all the political parties to prioritise cancer ahead of the next general election.’

Luciana Berger, Labour’s public health spokesman, said: ‘These figures are yet another warning sign the NHS is heading in the wrong direction.

Over 9,900 patients had to wait more than 62 days for treatment in the first six months of 2014. The two-week wait target for women with breast symptoms (file image), not initially thought to be cancer, was also breached

‘David Cameron claimed his NHS re-organisation would improve cancer care. The reality is that he has in fact made it worse.’ NHS England said the number of patients being referred urgently for cancer investigations had gone up by 18 per cent in the last year.

In 2013-14 there were 1.3million people referred urgently compared with just over 1million in 2010-11.

NHS England said it was setting up a taskforce, with Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority, to help the NHS maintain waiting time standards and tackle under-performance where necessary.

Sean Duffy, NHS England’s Clinical Director for Cancer, said it was performing well under pressure.

He added: ‘It is really good news the number of patients being diagnosed and treated for cancer early is on the rise. We have been encouraging patients to step forward early and they are.

‘We are now treating more people than ever before and as a result the NHS is helping more people than ever survive.

'Over the last five years we have seen a 51 per cent increase in the number of patients referred within two weeks for suspected cancer symptoms, which is good news for improving early diagnosis and survival.

‘We continue to treat the vast majority of patients within a month of deciding treatment is needed and it is imperative that we focus on maintaining waiting times standards as demand for care increases.’

Last night the Department of Health announced that an extra £250million was being given to hospitals and GP-led organisations to keep waiting times down.

It follows figures showing that an extra 250,000 patients are waiting for planned surgery or treatment compared to this time last year.

A spokesman said the increase was partly due to the ageing population, which means more patients are being referred by GPs.
