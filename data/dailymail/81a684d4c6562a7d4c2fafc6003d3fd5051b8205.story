Chris Rodgers does not conform to the archetypal image of a snarling Aussie, but he made it clear on Tuesday that his side have no intention of toning down their on-field conduct.

Respected BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew hit out at the Aussies’ behaviour in the Test series against India, saying it set a bad example following the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.

But Rogers, here to captain a Prime Minister’s XI in England’s final warm-up game before the tri-series against Australia and India, does not anticipate his team-mates changing.

Australia's Chris Rogers said England had weaknesses that could be easily exploited

He said: ‘From the outside, it looks like a few flashpoints and a bit of spite but that’s just the nature of Test cricket.

‘Everybody goes out and competes as hard as they can and at times anger can rise to the surface. I’d think it was pretty hard-fought but everybody got on afterwards and what happened stayed on the field.Everyone is desperate to win and sometimes these things happen. With the fast bowlers we have in our side, it’s about being aggressive, getting to the opposition. I wouldn’t think things would change particularly with the Ashes coming up.’

Rogers, the Aussie opener with one foot in the English camp as a Middlesex stalwart, also insisted there are cracks in an emerging England side for the old enemy to widen when Test hostilities resume in July.

‘There were good signs for England against India but there are still a few weaknesses,’ said Rogers. ‘They might be improving but they are nowhere near the highs of a few years back.

‘Your opening bowlers are particularly good but after that no-one has really nailed a spot. And the opening partnership is far from settled and that is going to be crucial if we bowl well.’

Rogers knows Sam Robson well from their days at Lord’s and even tried to persuade the Anglo-Australian to play for the land of his birth instead. He has watched his young colleague’s teething troubles in Test cricket with interest.

Rogers said Cook was 'under a lot of pressure and needs to be leading from the front'

‘Sam is under a bit of pressure at the top,’ said Rogers. ‘It is hard when you first play Test cricket and there are very few players who go in and dominate straight away. He’s still got a bit of work to do but he is the type of player who will find ways to get better.’

Robson looked to have a technical problem outside off-stump after the initial high last summer of a century against Sri Lanka. ‘He came back to Middlesex with a different technique to when he went into the England side,’ said Rogers. ‘A few things crept into his game which he should have been helped with but he wasn’t and that’s interesting.

‘But it’s not all about Sam. Alastair Cook is under a lot of pressure and needs to be leading from the front, particularly with a young opening partner. Maybe some time away from this intense environment will enable him to relax and come back stronger.’

Rogers intends to retire from international cricket after the Ashes and then hopes to have one last season at Middlesex. And it is another man of Lord’s that he is backing to do well as England try to upset the odds and become World Cup contenders.

‘Eoin Morgan will do well as one-day captain,’ said Rogers. ‘I’ve played under him in the shorter forms and he’s a positive, relaxed guy who will help others and lead from the front.’
