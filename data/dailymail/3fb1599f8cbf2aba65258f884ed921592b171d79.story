Tortured: James Ross was held hostage for 13 days

The sixth member of a gang who tortured a British man in a Reservoir Dogs-style attack on the Algarve, has been jailed for nine years.

Matthew Conde fled to Britain after discovering other gang members had been arrested by Portuguese police over the kidnap and maiming of James Ross.

He was subsequently detained on an international arrest warrant - but was still in custody in the UK when gang leader Steven Johnson was jailed for 25 years by an Algarve court after a trial in July last year.

Four other men received prison sentences at the time ranging from 15 to two-and-a-half years.

The same court in Loule near Faro jailed Conde, 26, yesterday to nine and a half years after convicting him of attempted murder and aggravated kidnapping.

Ross, 28, from Wick, Caithness, was held captive for 13 days in 2010 and tortured in a dispute over a Â£100,000 drugs debt.

Conde's sentencing judges announced in a written ruling: 'Despite it not being proven that Matthew Conde had inflicted the torture, he kept prisoner for several days a person who had body parts missing, had been burnt with a cigarette lighter and was suffering terrible pain.'

Defence lawyers for the Brit said afterwards they would appeal because Conde freed Ross after discovering his accomplices had been arrested by police.

Ross survived the horrific ordeal despite having an ear, two fingers and three toes cut off with bolt cutters.

He was also stripped naked, nailed to a piece of wood, burned with a cigarette lighter and beaten with a baseball bat.

Johnson's gang also crushed Ross's testicles in a clamp until he almost past out in agony.

Johnson was jailed for 25 years for attempted murder, kidnap, GBH and drug trafficking.

Fellow gang member Callum McLeod, 46, from Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, was sentenced to 15 years.

Terence McGurck, 34, and William Quinn, 55, both from Coventry, were 
jailed for eight years, and Ronald Lee Rose, 26, also from Coventry, for
two-and-a-half years.

Ross was lured to the Algarve with the promise of a job but was 
kidnapped shortly after landing at Faro airport and was taken to a 
secluded villa near Boliqueime.

Johnson, from Radcliffe, Manchester, believed Ross owed him money and 
that he had betrayed him by working for a rival gang of drug 
traffickers.

Johnson even cut off Ross's wedding ring finger and told his victim: 'This is for Donna,' Ross's wife and mother of kids James, seven and 
Danielle, 12.

Prosecutors said the gang planned to murder Ross by tying a 30 kilo weight to him and dumping in a reservoir.

But their plans were frustrated when the car with Ross inside crashed into a tree.

He managed to escape after police arrested some of the suspects.

Ross had plastic surgery and has since returned to Scotland.

Reliving his horror attack after 
coming home, he said: 'They sliced off the tendon in my leg. They were 
trying to chop my foot off.'

Conde was described during the trial last summer as gang leader Johnson's right-hand man.
