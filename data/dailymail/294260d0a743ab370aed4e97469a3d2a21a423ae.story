Gloucestershire have announced director of cricket John Bracewell will step down from his role next month.

New Zealander Bracewell will be replaced by a head coach, who Gloucestershire expect to be in place before the end of January.

The club said in a statement: 'With Gloucestershire County Cricket Club about to restructure its cricket operations a mutual agreement has been reached that the director of cricket John Bracewell will be leaving the club on 31 January 2015.

'The club hope to announce the appointment of a new head coach prior to John's departure.'

Bracewell has had two spells in charge at Nevil Road, winning five limited-overs cups and the County Championship Division Two title in his first tenure from 1999 to 2003 before struggling to replicate the success after returning in 2009. Between times, he was head coach of New Zealand.

The 56-year-old said of his exit: 'There are times in a coach's career when he has to take the training wheels off and let his charges make their own decisions on how they move forward. I feel this time is now.

'This group of players are ripe to produce and I would like to thank them and my coaching staff for their hard work and desire to learn and improve.'

Gloucestershire were unable to climb out of the second tier of the County Championship during Bracewell's six-season second stint at the helm.
