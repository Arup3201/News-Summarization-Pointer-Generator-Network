Collapse: Masked gunman Alan Levers died during a botched armed robbery at a Plymouth bookmakers

Two betting shop punters were hailed as heroes by police last night for disarming and restraining a masked gunman, who then collapsed and died.

The customers tackled violent career criminal Alan Levers when he burst into a branch of Ladbrokes brandishing a pistol and wearing a gas-mask.

But despite risking their lives there was speculation that the two, as yet unnamed, men could face charges over the death.

Detectives are studying CCTV images from inside the Plymouth shop to find out how the robber – who had recently been released from jail for carrying out another armed raid – was brought to the ground and held down before the police arrived.

Today it was reported that Levers was wearing the gas mask while being restrained and was dead by the time police arrived.

But by last night Devon & Cornwall Police had neither arrested nor interviewed under caution the two men, and instead commented on their courage.

Chief Superintendent Andy Bickley said: ‘The actions taken by members of the public in the shop were brave and showed a disregard for their own safety.’

Levers, 50, who had a criminal record for offences including assault and burglary dating back to when he was 13, was jailed for four years in 2010 after he pointed an imitation handgun at the head of a terrified assistant in a corner shop as he stole £600 from her till.

He was understood to have only recently been released from prison for that offence when he carried out Friday’s raid in the Honicknowle area of Plymouth near his home.

Death: Police officers outside the betting shop in Crownhill Road last night, where the robber burst through the doors wearing a gas mask and brandishing a gun

Levers went into the branch of 
Ladbrokes in the early evening armed with a replica gun and wearing the 
Second World War-style gas-mask. He is thought to have been restrained 
for about ten minutes after he was disarmed by the men.

Eyewitness David Walker saw the two customers holding the robber on the floor when he walked into the shop at 6.45 pm.

The only others present were the counter assistant and an older man.

Mr Walker said: ‘I don’t think you can
 blame the customers for what happened. They were just holding him down 
and making sure he could not get up.’ Regular punter Ivor Green, 67, 
said there would be anger locally if charges were laid.

Dead: A relative of Alan Levers said his uncle had been trying to move on from his criminal past after a spell in prison

‘I don’t know who the punters were but they would have been very protective towards the Ladbrokes assistant,’ he said.

‘He is in there, undefended, on his 
own and facing an armed robber. Of course they’re not going to just 
stand by. If charges are placed against people trying to defend a shop 
worker, then that would be a terrible miscarriage of justice.’

A police armed response unit arrived to find the armed robber unconscious, arrested him and attempted resuscitation.

Paramedics then took over but Levers was certified dead minutes later in hospital.

Scene: The shop was closed today as police launched an investigation into the 'very serious' incident last night

Gunman: Police officers and paramedics performed CPR on the robber inside the Plymouth Ladbrokes, but he was declared dead at the scene around 20 minutes later

Last year Conservative Ministers 
pledged to allow the use of any level of force by members of the public 
against assailants as long as it was not ‘grossly disproportionate’.

But critics say their ‘bash a burglar’ rhetoric risks encouraging vigilantism.

Michael Wolkind, QC, who defended Tony
 Martin, the farmer jailed for shooting dead a teenage burglar at his 
Norfolk home in 1999, said the two men in the betting shop acted within 
the law in restraining Levers.

‘The robber chose to come in wearing 
some sort of breathing apparatus, he chose to have a gun so people would
 be in fear, so it would be unreasonable to suggest the people who 
restrained him should stop and check he is all right in an evolving 
situation such as this.’

Alison Seabeck, Labour MP for Plymouth
 Moor View, said: ‘It’s very important that what happened is properly 
investigated, not least because the person who died also has family and,
 whatever the rights and wrongs, his family will want to know what 
happened as well.’

The case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Levers was described by relatives as a ‘generous’ father of three who was trying to go straight.

His nephew Peter Levers, 28, said: ‘He
 had recently been reunited with his family, he was back in touch with 
his kids, he had a great missus. I can’t understand why he would do this
 now when he had everything to live for. Right now we want answers. We 
need to know exactly what happened.’
