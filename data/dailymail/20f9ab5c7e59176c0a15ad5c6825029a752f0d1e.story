A man has been left 'disgusted' after eating a roast chicken he bought from a supermarket only to realise it was riddled with maggots.

Scott Watterson bought the hot chicken from a Coles supermarket at Port Lincoln, west of Adelaide, on Tuesday before heading off to work.

'I opened it at lunch time, pulled my hand out after eating half of it to find maggots on my hand,' Mr Watterson told Seven News.

'All they could do was offer us a $20 gift voucher,' Mr Watterson said.

Coles said it started investigating immediately, but an inspection of the deli area found no evidence of contamination.

The Port Lincoln supermarket also passed a full technical assessment last week, prior to the maggot incident.

Mr Watterson said he wouldn't shop there again and also wouldn't recommend eating maggots

But Mr Watterson said he won't be going back.

I wouldn't recommend shopping there and I wouldn't recommend eating maggots because they don't taste very nice,' he said.
