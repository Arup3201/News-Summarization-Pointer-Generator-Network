Mexican gang members stabbed a teenager to death before taunting his family on Facebook by giving gruesome clues about where he was buried.

Victim Irvin Reyes, aged 14, was kidnapped as he left school in Ciudad Juarez, a city in northern Mexico and taken to a derelict house.

Police believe he was attacked and badly beaten before being stabbed and dumped in the abandoned house, with his body buried under the floorboards.

Fourteen-year-old Irvin Reyes who was beaten and stabbed to death by a gang in Mexico before they taunted his family over Facebook with gruesome clues over where he was buried 

Irvin's parents were then left wondering where their son was after being taken by the gang on his way home from school. 

Then members of the gang spent the week after the killing taunting the youngster's family through anonymous Facebook accounts, telling them their son was dead and leaving gruesome clues as to where he could be.

Eventually they revealed the address of where Irvin's body had been dumped and police found his remains.

Police spokesman Comissario Tirso Diaz said: 'They had been taunting and bullying him on the internet and social media for several months. We do not yet know why he was targeted.

'It was a particularly cruel way to tell his mother and father what they had done but they made a game of it with various clues.

The gang took Irvin to this street in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez and dumped his body in an abandoned house 

'The mother was with the police detectives when the body was found and identified him from the clothing including new trainers that he had purchased only a day before he vanished.'

Police are now attempting to track down the gang members using the messages they sent to Irvin and his family.

Mr Diaz added: 'They think they have been clever but they left a very wide trail to follow through social media.

'There is no doubt that we will find them.'
