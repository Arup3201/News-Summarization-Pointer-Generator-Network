The bodies of twin British pensioners have been found dead in their Spanish flat in what police believe may have been a double suicide.

James and George Chalkley, both 83, were found in the property they shared in the Andalusian coastal town of Fuengirola, near Malaga, on Wednesday.

Investigators think one of the brothers may have returned home to find his sibling had taken his life - and decided to do the same.

Tragedy: The British twins were living in an apartment on this street - Federico Ruiz Vertedor - in Fuengirola

Fuengirola is a Spanish coastal town popular with British tourists and ex-pats

A suicide note was recovered at the scene.

They had lived together in their 
third-floor flat in Fuengirola for around 13 years after moving to the 
area from Holland where they lived initially after their retirement.

A post-mortem was due to take place later today.

One of the victims was found sprawled on a chair in his living room with
 two plastic bags tied tightly over his head with rope and masking tape.

A source close to the inquiry said: 'An investigation has been launched 
but everything at this stage is pointing to a double suicide.

'One twin had a head injury but we believe it may have been the result 
of him banging his head against the wall as he was asphyxiating himself.

'We believe one twin left the flat after rowing with his brother and took his own life after returning to find him dead.

'An investigating judge placed in charge of the inquiry into their death is now examining all this in more detail.'

The dead pair, both from London, are understood to have spent their whole lives living together.

They shared a flat in the UK before moving together to Amsterdam and then the Costa del Sol.

James worked as a lorry driver before retiring and moving into part-time TV and film acting,  including as an extra on Eastenders in the early nineties.

He spent about four years on the BBC1 soap playing the part of a market trader, and also appeared as an extra on ITV's The Bill.

George had worked in hospitals.

Neighbours alerted the emergency services after noticing a bad smell coming from the apartment.

Firefighters entered through an adjacent flat at 6pm on Wednesday.

The
 brothers could have been lying dead for up to three days, police said, 
adding that there did not seem to be any evidence of foul play.

'Iâ€™m
 absolutely shocked,' Ignacio Pacios, a lawyer working in the same 
building, told The Local, an English-language Spanish newspaper.

'They were a very polite and easy-going pair. I never would have guessed theyâ€™d do something like that.'
