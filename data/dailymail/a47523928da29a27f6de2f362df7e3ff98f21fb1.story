A two-year-old toddler discovered up a bag of cocaine while she played at a children’s centre.

The two-year-old girl was spotted clutching the bag of class A drug during a play session at Charlestown and Lower Kersal Sure Start Centre in Salford.

Shocked staff dialled 999 and police sent the bag for testing, which revealed it contained cocaine.

She was one of eight youngsters attending Oakland Day Nursery at the centre, on St Aidan’s Road.

Salford mayor Ian Stewart said staff had acted ‘quickly and professionally’ by removing the package and informing police.

He said: 'The package was intact and still sealed so thankfully there was no indication that any children had been harmed by the powder.

However, we do take situations like this very seriously and we are doing all we can to support the police with their investigation.'

The children are understood to have been in a public area of the Sure Start centre at the time, and were being supervised by two members of nursery staff.

The horrified mother of one toddler who was in the class said: 'I got a call saying that they had found a bag of cocaine and they had no idea where it came from.

'It’s disgusting. It’s a nursery. You expect your kid to be safe when they are there and you place your trust in them.'

Julia Johnston, manager at the Oakland Day Nursery, said: 'Safeguarding procedures were, as always, in place.

The safety of our children is paramount. Our staff are very vigilant and spotted that the girl was holding the bag straight away.'

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Riddick said: 'We understand that any parent will be concerned by this, but I want to reassure them that no child was harmed.

'Also there is no indication that anyone has been using or dealing drugs in the centre’s grounds. Inquiries are ongoing.'

The centre, housed in a newly refurbished building in Lower Kersal Primary School, offers a baby clinic, baby massage and parents group as well as other family-based group sessions.
