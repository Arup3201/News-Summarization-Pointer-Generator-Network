'Got sums wrong': Alan Johnson said the numbers coming were much greater than the forecast

Alan Johnson yesterday became the third former Labour Home Secretary this week to admit their party’s open door immigration policy had been wrong.

Mr Johnson, who presided over the Home Office under Gordon Brown, suggested Labour had encouraged immigration while in power to boost the economy, but he conceded they had ‘got the sums wrong’.

In a bombshell intervention earlier in the week, Jack Straw said throwing open Britain’s borders to migrants from Eastern Europe had been a ‘spectacular mistake’.

Mr Straw, who was Home Secretary under Tony Blair, said it had been ‘a well-intentioned policy we messed up’.

And David Blunkett, who also served under Mr Blair, warned this week that racial tensions could ‘explode’ unless migrants ‘change their culture’ and work harder to integrate in Britain.

Labour’s reputation on immigration has been shredded following a 2004 decision to not restrict workers when eight former Soviet bloc countries joined the EU. The Government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to Britain each year and fill job vacancies, but the total over a decade was more than a million.

Mr Johnson said: ‘There was a very good argument for doing it, but they got the sums wrong and the numbers coming were much greater than forecast. It was good economics and bad policy.’

He told the BBC: ‘It was 2004 and three things were happening. The birth rate was going down. The dependency ratio – the amount of people working compared to the number of people retired – went down from 12 to one, when Lloyd George introduced the pension, to four to one.

'And it was due to go down to two to one – two people working for every one person retired. And we had a 75 per cent employment rate – one of the highest we had ever seen.

Back track: Mr Straw wrote in his local 
newspaper that the decision was made based on data showing 5,000 to 
13,000 migrants a year would come to Britain. 'Events proved these 
forecasts worthless'

Concession: David Blunkett, here in 2004 with Tony Blair, also warned the influx of migrants could cause riots

‘So for Sweden, Britain and Ireland, the three most successful economies – although you might wonder what that success was based on – there was a lot of sense in doing that.’

Ed Miliband has apologised for the last Labour government’s immigration policy.

The Labour leader has also attempted to toughen up the party’s language on the issue, although it is yet to be backed up by significant new policies to curb numbers. Opinion polls consistently show Labour trailing the Tories on the subject.

Meanwhile, Ken Livingstone yesterday attacked the ‘cowardice’ of the last Labour government’s economic policies, saying Mr Brown borrowed too much in order to avoid having to raise taxes.

Eviction: Border Agency officials evict immigrants from a derelict site in London. Despite raids such 
as this a report has found that just one in every 67 reports of illegal 
immigration result in a person being deported

The former London Mayor also warned Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls against pinning their economic strategy on increased borrowing.

He said: ‘I don’t believe that borrowing is your way to the future. The simple reality is that British governments, Left and Right, have borrowed money because they haven’t had the courage either to make the cuts that you need to balance the budget or the tax increases you need to balance the budget.

‘Gordon Brown was borrowing £20billion [a year] because he wanted to increase public spending. It was an act of cowardice.’
