One man's hobby has led to a series of explosive pictures capturing some of the most stormy conditions to rock the US.

The incredible photographs show the visual impact of lightning as giant bolts can be seen striking the Arizona landscape and dominating the skyline.

U.S.-born technician, Steven Maguire, 49, 
is a daring storm-chaser in his spare time – and he describes the 
pictures he took of the lightning strikes captured in Arizona.

Technician and storm chaser Steven Maguire captured the incredible images in the state of Arizona during some of the most stormy conditions to hit the country

'Most people see just a storm image, what I see is the beauty of what the storm delivers in a very split second in time,' he said.

'I scout locations during the off season looking for different views that I think would be interesting to photograph.

'Then when the storms start to develop I already have an idea of where I want to set up for the shot.'

By scouting locations during the off season, he is better prepared for the shots. He then waits for the forecasts to indicate a storm is brewing before going into action

The state of Arizona has monsoon season thunderstorms and chasing them is a risky business. An average of 51 people die every year from lightning strikes in the US

The remarkable pictures capture moments that are only visible for milliseconds when seen by the naked eye - what Mr Maguire calls the storm's 'beauty'

The University of Arizona states that one cloud-to-ground lightning strike can generate between 100 million and 1 billion volts and reach temperatures of more than 27,000 degrees.

According to the weather service there is an average of 51 deaths a year in the US from lightning strikes.

Mr Maguire uses a variety of cameras and lenses to capture the incredible shots.

'I enjoy photography so much that there's always something new to learn every time I go out and shoot,' he said. 'The longest I have been out is anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 hours shooting some storms.

'Sometimes the storm puts you in a place you didn’t expect and you capture a shot that turns out to be a winner.

'There are a lot of frustrating moments when chasing storms. If you are really passionate enough and keep with it, the payoff is worth it.'

Mr Maguire said patience was key for getting great photographs while storm chasing. Using weather and forecasting technology, he can ensure he is well prepared

Mr Maguire's daring photography work chasing storms is only a hobby, although one shoot can take him anywhere between 30 minutes and five hours

He said his passion for photography was strong enough that when he finally gets the shot he wants it is worth all the 'frustrating' moments
