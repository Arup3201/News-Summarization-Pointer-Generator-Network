Teenagers suffering from mental health problems will be encouraged to use online apps to treat themselves as part of Government plans to transform how depression is dealt with.

Care Minister Norman Lamb said the Government is currently looking at how to modernise children and young people's mental health care and warned that GPs must not put patients on anti-depressants as a 'sort of default position'.

Mr Lamb has previously criticised services for young people as being 'stuck in the dark ages' and 'not fit for purpose'. 

The aim of new programmes being developed in mental health care is to provide a 'seamless' service, Mr Lamb told The Times.

'If you're a teenager and your world revolves around digital access we must make sure you get access to therapy online,' he said.

'What I want to achieve is a much more seamless service that allows you access online, face to face or over the telephone, whichever is appropriate.'

He added that a 'worry' exists about doctors putting people on medication because they think there is no alternative.

He said the online tools made available to young people could include computerised cognitive behavioural therapy, online counselling and peer support networks for the mentally ill.  

Lucie Russell, of YoungMinds charity, said services do need to be adapted for modern society, but warned of a risk of some people not seeking help from their GP and getting the medication they need.

She added: 'What we need is a plethora of different responses to young people who are struggling.

'Sometimes young people can be scared or feel intimidated about phoning their doctor whereas online they are able to engage more freely.

'What there does need to be though is some regularity and I would say that the online support, while very useful, should never take the place of face-to-face therapies.

'Apps should always lead onto phone or face-to-face support, working as a signpost for young people and enabling them to get the help they need.

'If the NHS plans to work on apps, the most important thing is that they speak to the young people, to those who have the first-hand experience. That way they can work out what sort of services they're looking for.' 

Earlier this month the Commons' Health Select Committee said graphic online content had resulted in a direct increase in mental health problems among young people, including stress and anxiety.

In their report, MPs said there were 'major problems' with access to inpatient mental health services and an unacceptable variation in the quality of services, with families facing 'battles' to have their children treated.

They heard evidence from children who had spent months on a waiting list for therapy while some services admitted to being so overwhelmed that they only treated children once they had seriously self-harmed. 

In the report, they highlighted figures from several NHS trusts, including Cornwall where referrals to clinics have increased by between 20 and 25 per cent since last year.

Referrals were for conditions including depression, anxiety, self-harming, eating disorders and attempted suicide.

The MPs said the popularity of websites such as Facebook meant that bullying ‘follows children home’.

At the time, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health Select Committee, said: ‘What children face now is that the bullying follows them way beyond the walk home from school.

‘For some young people it’s clearly a new source of distress.’

‘Young women are finding they have shared an image in good faith but then it widely distributed online by young men in the classroom

‘It’s become normalised within some school environments.’

The report also highlighted figures from the charity Childline showing that there had been an 87 per cent increase in the numbers of calls from children about online bullying.

Overall, it warned that there are ‘serious’ and ‘ingrained’ problems in the NHS’s care for children and teenagers with psychological problems.
