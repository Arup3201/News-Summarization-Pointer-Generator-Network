It should have been a textbook landing – but a sudden gust of wind meant this little puffin ended up looking like Eddie the Eagle in mid-flight.

The comical acrobatics of a colony of birds were captured by amateur photographer Johan Siggesson on a blustery day on a remote Scots island.

The birds’ aerial dexterity was tested to the limit in the adverse weather conditions off Fair Isle earlier this week.

The bird's aerial dexterity was pushed to the limit on the blustery day in Fair Isle

Frantically flapping their wings whilst being blown sideways, others appeared to almost nose dive to the ground.

Eventually they came to land on a grassy patch but had to keep flailing around to stop themselves being whirled away by the strong winds.

Yet it was the hilarious antics of this little chap, dubbed ‘Eck the Puffin’, that really caught the photographer’s eye.

Mr Siggesson, 37, from Gzira Malta, said: ‘I was on Fair Isle for six or seven days, just to see the puffins.

'It was a wonderful experience, made all the more so thanks to this one bird as he attempted to land despite the windy weather.’

Eddie ‘the Eagle’ Edwards became the first competitor to represent Britain in the Olympic ski-jumping in 1988 – coming last.

But last year he won ITV’s celebrity diving competitio Splash! under the guidance of Olympic medalist Tom Daley.

Even on firm ground, the puffins had trouble staying up right with Eck even resembling Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's lightning bolt pose
