Ellie Fairfax and sister Siobhan whose baby she's carrying

When Siobhan Terry was told she could not have any more children after battling cervical cancer, she was left heartbroken.

Life-saving treatment meant the mother-of-one would be left infertile and unable to give her daughter Saoirse, two, a little brother or sister.

But the 31-year-old and her husband Dean, 51, had not counted on the selfless actions of her sister, Ellie Fairfax.

On hearing the terrifying news that her younger sibling would die if she did not have the treatment, Miss Fairfax did not hesitate to volunteer as a surrogate.

‘Ellie gave me a hug and I broke down when she said simply, “well I’ll have a baby for you”,’ Mrs Terry recalled. And the 33-year-old trainee cardiac physiologist has been true to her word.

Now pregnant using Mr Terry’s sperm, she is counting down to the birth next month when she will hand over her first child – a little boy – to her sister. ‘Having a baby for Siobhan feels completely natural,’ said Miss Fairfax.

‘Watching my sister battle with cancer was hard enough. But it’s almost more upsetting to know she couldn’t have another baby.

‘So having a baby for her was an easy decision.’

The sisters have always been close, left, and their bond grew even stronger after Siobhan was diagnosed

The sisters, from Beckenham in south-east London, are the eldest of four and have always been close. But their bond grew stronger when Mrs Terry was diagnosed with cancer in December 2012 after a routine smear test. She said: ‘I urgently needed intense radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Dean and I desperately wanted a sibling for Saoirse but it would destroy my eggs and leave my uterus too scarred to carry a baby.’ When she told her family the heartbreaking news, her sister instantly volunteered to carry a baby for her.

‘As soon as I said it, it felt right,’ said Miss Fairfax. ‘We’d always adored being one of four and I couldn’t imagine her just having one child.’ By last August Mrs Terry had successfully completed her treatment and the sisters announced their plans to their parents, Patricia, 60, a clinical physiologist, and Peter, also 60, a retired teacher.

Miss Fairfax recalled: ‘My mum was overwhelmed with emotion and incredibly proud.’

The sisters bought an artificial fertilisation kit on the internet.

On the second month of trying Miss Fairfax discovered she was pregnant. ‘Incredibly I found out on Siobhan’s birthday. We were out walking in the park with Saoirse when I broke the news.

‘Although biologically the baby is my own child, I’ve always felt I’m not having him for me. So I’ve never worried I won’t be able to hand him to Siobhan when the time comes.’

Mrs Terry, who now has the all-clear from cancer, said: ‘My mum and I will be at Ellie’s side when she gives birth while Dean will wait outside the delivery room.

‘I would never have considered surrogacy with anyone other than my sister but it feels right our little boy will grow up with all of his family around him.

‘I am so thankful to Ellie – it’s a dream come true.’
