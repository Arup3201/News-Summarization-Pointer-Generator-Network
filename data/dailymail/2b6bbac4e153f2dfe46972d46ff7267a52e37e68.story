The tempestuous relationship between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton still has the potential to shock almost four decades later.

A major new BBC drama about the Hollywood lovers had to be re-written because it was littered with too many swear words.

BBC bosses panicked when they received the first draft of ‘Burton and Taylor’ which will be broadcast tomorrow night on BBC Four because it contained 49 different uses of the F word as well as a reference to the c word.

One source close to the production, which stars Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter said bosses ordered a re-write to edit out the swearing

Taylor and Burton, who married and divorced each other twice over - both swore like troopers particularly during their spectacular off-screen bust-ups.

But producers thought the language in the original script was too blue even for a drama to be broadcast at 9.00 pm.

One source close to the production, which stars Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter said: 'The BBC thought the language in the production was a problem and William Ivory the writer was asked to remove a lot of the swearing.

'Bosses said "Billy we love the script but we simply can’t have 49 f***s and a c-word".

'Billy was just trying to capture the rhythm of their speech and simply hadn’t realised just how much swearing he had included in the script.'

The toned down version of the screenplay still doesn’t pull any punches and it may still strike some viewers as too risque.

The tempestuous pair - who married twice - became lovers on the set of the film Cleopatra

Both characters, who became lovers on the set of the film Cleopatra, use the f word including in one scene where they row and Taylor slaps her husband around the face.

He tells her to stop ‘f***ing hitting him’ and she says she will when he ‘f***ing apologises’

In another scene Burton uses the c-word to describe the critics who have just savaged the production of Private Lives in which they are both starring.

The drama focuses on the couple’s decision to star in a 1983 production of Noel Coward’s comedy about a divorced couple.

Although the two stars, who made eleven films together, are no longer lovers they can’t help but reminisce about their previous sex life.

In one scene set in a hotel room Burton bemoans the fact that he is getting older and that he struggled to ‘get his sword of his sheath and wave it about a bit’ during a recent production of Camelot.

A delighted Taylor tells him 'Not like you Richard,' before she is told off for having the mind of a ‘collier’.

Taylor then asks her former husband 'How do you f*** anyway?  You can barely move?'

He replies: 'There are ways and means my love. 'Remember that train we took to New York and we lay there and let the rocking of the carriage do the job.'  

In a flashback scene, set ten years earlier Burton asks his wife why she is dressed like an ‘over-ripe tart’ while they are preparing to exercise in a hotel room.

She replies: 'I thought maybe we could screw afterwards,' and then bemoans the state of her breasts.

She tells Burton: 'I am holding my bosom. Its bouncing up and down. Richard I am 40 years of age. They are 40 years of age.   They have gained a certain amount of elasticity.'

A besotted Burton tells her: 'You are so gorgeous. Your tits are gorgeous, your arse is gorgeous, your legs, your belly,  Did I mention your tits?  Let’s just screw.'   

She tells him: 'We can be extra vigorous.'

Taylor is portrayed as still being deeply in love with Burton and desperate to rekindle their romance.

She is resentful of Burton’s new found love for actress Sally Hay who he would eventually marry during the run of Private Lives.

For his part Burton wants to re-assure that Taylor she will always have place in his life even though he realises he most move on.

He tells her: 'I will always love you Elizabeth, as long as I live. But us together it will destroy me. I can’t do it. That is what I had to say to you. That is why I did this bloody job.'

Dr Frances Warner, an Emeritus Fellow at Oxford University, who was a close friend of Burton’s and who organised the couple’s second wedding reception said: 'I think that was the case. He did try and move on and eventually he did.

'He and Elizabeth remained in constant contact and they did telephone each other a lot.

'But all of that was understood by Sally who supported him and was an actual saint.'

Jose Eber, the Beverly Hills-based hair stylist who was one of Taylor’s friends said the fact that she swore a lot simply added to her appeal.

He said: 'So what. She was a real person who was passionate about life.'

'She said what she wanted to say and I applaud her for being herself.'
